"Folks, a reminder that [Rule 3](/r/offmychest/about/rules) focuses this community's scope on providing emotional support only. We do not allow solicitation or material offers.

This means OPs cannot hint at or ask for money, and community members cannot offer money or food. There are local services that can verify and address a person's situation better than any of us can (and many services will not turn people away if they are asking for it). A kind community member offered a scammer a job and that is okay.

This community is read by millions of people, and scammers around the world know this. We have cultivated an empathic community so we know it can be hard to resist offering material help. It takes only one person to make it worth it because it costs nothing to post. That is why the rules are strictly enforced.

There are many signs of a scammer. They will present a financially desperate situation often with a highly emotional component. They are likely to mention payment services. They may have payment services in their Reddit profile and ask people to look at their profile. They will ask people to privately message them. All of these behaviors may be obfuscated with weird spacing and other ways to evade detection. If they evade detection it's up to the community to report it. Do not call out OPs, report only.

Thank you for your cooperation."	AutoModerator	post	39.865298995710276	female	White	0.00993325375020504	na	na	na	49	offmychest	no prediction.

Good to know! I have given money to someone on year quite a few months ago. Didn't realize at the time.  They were nice and chatted about their issues after though...didn't take the money and run, so I think it was legit at least. Won't be doing it again.

Good to know. I enjoy reading the posts here and sometimes to comment in a supportive fashion. I’d like to know how to post here I need support right now. My daughter responded to a Facebook posting for a rental and it was a scam. She online called the person out and then through messenger the person threaten to murder her and her Family. Put pictures of family members into the Facebook message.  It was reported to Facebook yet there’s been no action and I honestly I’m just disgusted on all levels angry and scared. I feel like I need an Uber geek….. yeah I’m so burnt out probably going to go off Facebook and I told her to also. Yet there’s a couple of groups that I really want to be part of so I’m just treading water at this time.  I am actually quite scared, this person may just be a scammer from another country yet the violence threatening to kill her father,  sister and other family members was a little bit over the top and they posted pictures of these family members.  Again Facebook did not respond. I asked Facebook to deactivate the persons profile and they said no reason to, it was OK.  Thanks for your patience and reading this to whoever did. I am over the solutions and we’ll just hang tight and hopefully not too many people come to break down the door.

Seriously, with the way things are now you’d be surprised how many assistance programs are out there.

Late commet and only partially relevant I don't know if this was a one time message or situation has gotten worse but through reddit comments I saw the recommendation for The gift of fear by Gavin Debecker and its all about recognizing and predicting violent behavior but there's alot more about intuition and following it as we subconsciously recognize things. I also used to think of myself as a very aware of my surroundings person but since reading it I've realized I'm guilty of some of these habits. For instance getting on an elevator with a male stranger that makes you uncomfortable because you don't want to seem rude he points out what's sillier waiting a moment for the next elevator or getting into a soundproof steal box with a stranger you are afraid of. I honestly feel like EVERY WOMEN SHOULD READ THIS BOOK. I would suggest it for your daughter as well as it might make her recognize certain behaviors in the future in reference to scammer.

"OffMyChest is a support community and continuous availability is paramount. OffMyChest will be open and available as usual through the Blackout protest officially beginning on June 12, 2023 for two days, and as long as we are reasonably able to.

Reddit's announced API changes adversely impact moderator ability to moderate, which threatens this community's safety and existence. The changes remove user choice and ability to access Reddit.

A ""Blackout"" is being organized to encourage Reddit to reconsider and salvage the situation before the July 1, 2023 changes. [Thousands of communities will shut down during that time,](https://mashable.com/article/reddit-steve-huffman-ceo-ama-third-api-backlash) and many are opting to do so indefinitely.

OffMyChest moderators support this direct action in solidarity with thousands of unpaid volunteers, blind and visually impaired people, affected users, researchers, and all stakeholders. We call for a 6-month minimum postponement with a scaled transitory and openly collaborative period before fully instituting the API changes, to ensure stakeholder issues are resolved.

Again, **OffMyChest will remain open to provide support**. If you have questions, please see our FAQ below with additional resources.

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

## What will happen if these changes are implemented on July 1?

[Third party apps are being shut down or will shut down.](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) With 30 days notice of pricing there is [not enough time for anyone to adjust accordingly](https://reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/jnk8m0z/). Many tech companies like Google provide a significant ""test drive"" time period, with non-charged but real number billing so developers can adjust before getting truly billed. While Reddit is not explicitly prohibiting third party apps, the situation is such none can be viable without an exemption.

Many moderators use a third party app to moderate. The official app is still catching up with desktop tools. If forced to use the official app, they will be completely unable to perform certain duties, and the workflow is slower. Many moderators would quit, and those that stay behind would be forced to be less productive. It makes recruiting moderators much more difficult.

Nearly all moderation tools use the API. Reddit says there will be no impact but we will not know until it happens. It's not clear what new tools will face. If it's not adopted quickly and widely enough, will it be granted access or [ignored](https://reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/comment/jnk2pp3/?context=3)?

Moderation tools fight spam, scammers, child sexual abusers, and more. If those tools break, users will be directly affected.

Third-party user tools will be impacted. For example, many [user data backup and deletion use the API](https://github.com/j0be/PowerDeleteSuite). Sites that show [statistics](https://subredditstats.com/) will be severely restricted. [Reddit Enhancement Suite doesn't use the API but may still be impacted.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RESAnnouncements/comments/141hyv3/announcement_res_reddits_upcoming_api_changes/)

[Blind and visually impaired users depend on third party apps because the official IOS app is not sufficiently accessible.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/13zr8h2/reddits_recently_announced_api_changes_and_the/) These users also depend on [captions provided by captioners that depend on the API](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToR_Meta/comments/13yhnxa/june_monthly_meta_not_quite_the_rainbow_we_were/).

## Why is this protest action two days and not indefinitely?

This is not the only action Reddit moderators and users can make. This quantifiably shows how many people are stakeholders and are not being considered seriously. This action has created a coalition of people who can quickly reach a consensus on further action.

## I use the official Reddit app. Why should I care?

It is clear that Reddit is not fully considering existing users and moderators as a significant stakeholder. Reddit expects them to be replaced by new users. In the future, when Reddit does something to drive you away, you can't achieve anything if we do nothing now.

## What if someone makes a non-commercial third party app?

It will be inherently second-class. Users will not have access to NSFW content. [The app will have to respect slow rate limits as all users of the app will be aggregated as one.](https://reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/jnk7rfg/) If the app becomes popular, it will exceed those rate limits and enter the paid tier. How can a non-commercial app pay for API pricing if it can't accept funding?

## What if a third party app lets users bring their own API (client/secret) key?

1. Users without a Reddit account will not be able to access Reddit at all. They'll need to create an account via some other means.
2. Not all users are technically skilled enough to get one.
3. It will be slow. [The API change encourages OAuth with a rate of 100 requests per minute. Client/secret has a rate of 10 per minute.](https://reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/13wsiks/api_update_enterprise_level_tier_for_large_scale/)
4. Client/secret gives 100% control of the account to whoever has it. It is major a security issue, while OAuth is considered more secure.
5. [Reddit Developer Terms, 3.1: *Access Info*](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/developer-terms#text-content3) seems to prohibit this: ""You may not share your Access Info with any other third party without Reddit’s permission, and you will keep your Access Info secure at all times.""

## What about the Reddit Developer Platform?

[It is simply nowhere near ready to be able to replace existing tools. In fact, it's not clear if it could ever replace existing tools.](https://reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/jnkaury/)

## What can I, as a user, do?

* Contact Reddit privately and publicly. Tag them on other platforms and talk about how it will affect you and people you care about. 
   * [Submit a Reddit help request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?) (suggested: ""Other Help"").
   * [@Reddit on Twitter](https://twitter.com/reddit)
   * Use hashtag: **#RedditBlackout**
* Support other communities' protest announcements posts. If a community is not participating do not bother them. Protest must be done willingly.
* Learn what you can do in r/Save3rdPartyApps.
* During the Blackout try not to visit Reddit or consume or produce Reddit content and limit your usage to responsible necessity. That matters more than communities shutting down.

## Where can I see the Blackout without going to Reddit?

* https://save3rdpartyapps.com/
* https://www.twitch.tv/reddark_247 (livestream)

## How do I delete my account?

*Deleting your account does not delete your content.* Your posts, comments, votes, etc.. will remain on the platform. When you created your account [you agreed to grant Reddit](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement/):

>a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, distribute, store, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed anywhere in the world. This license includes the right for us to make Your Content available for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with Reddit. You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content.

If you want to delete your content, it is not possible to easily access all your data through the website UI or any browser script or extension. For a truly thorough cleaning, [request your data from Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/settings/data-request) to get all links. Once you have this, you can use [Power Delete Suite](https://github.com/j0be/PowerDeleteSuite) or [Redact app](https://redact.dev/download) to automatically overwrite and delete posts and comments, and follow up with your list for anything they missed.

Then you can delete your account from your account settings. Note it may take up to 90 days for data to be removed from Reddit, and Reddit must keep some data for legal purposes. Additionally, search engines/web crawlers/archivers may have copies.

"My partner is the MD of the company. Last year they hired a new exec, lets call them R. So this R person made it very obvious the first week of work that they are interested in the boss. And my partner who at first was dumb enough to fall for their tricks and was oblivious made R believe that my partner may have interest in them too but just restricted to reciprocate because of me, the SO. 

Few things happen along the year; once or twice tricks like booking the same room during outstations with excuses like cutting costs, overbooked hotels etc. R actions towards my partner never sit right with me. I always have bad feelings whenever R’s name comes up in a conversation. From the stories and how my partner was always showered with gifts (who gives their boss the latest iphone because they  want the boss to be able to Facetime them? Lol) Drama after drama, i picked up R’s motives, and thankfully my partner is smart enough to always avoid anything that might lead to it. We talked about this and understand each others viewpoint on this matter.

Yada yada last night R drunkenly called up my partner and saying things like “how could you do this to me? You gave me hope then you ignored me” and things of that line. They had a screaming match for a while and then is when R said “you know what, im resigning. I cant take this anymore. I dont know why your partner isnt letting you to get to know me and have a relationship with me.”

"Talk to him. Like an actual conversation before you blow up. My partner had a very high sex drive before and during pregnancy, and was rather feisty within days of giving birth. We waited, and jumped on the chance. Then suddenly she was turning it down or acting grossed out, and I felt like I was a pest. Turns out sex hurt, and she was having trouble with lubrication (very much not an issue beforehand), and was embarrassed and then avoided it, and got annoyed by my continued persistence.

We did have a couple arguments, but we were able to sit down and discuss the issue. We just had to adjust for awhile until her body got back to equilibrium. A year later, we still aren’t where we were before (a baby is a major energy drain lmao), but we are both open about our needs and if things get off track for a couple weeks, she will tell me to drop the baby off at grandmas before she comes home from work and we will grab an hour for fun time to just reconnect. 

He most likely does not want to be seen as an irritant. Probably is oblivious to most of what you said here, and if you’re home and he’s at work, doesn’t get how fucking hard it is to be home with a baby all day (I’ve seen both sides and being home is much more mentally difficult, and that’s hard to communicate to a person with a “job”) scheduling a date night for booty is a good idea until things get back to a normal and you two adjust to all the changes.

And no showering for the first month or so, as there is a belief that the pores are open and they don't want moisture to seep in, causing rheumatism down the line. I'm pretty sure there's more to this, but these are the 2 details I can remember at the moment.

So yeah, just want to clarify that confinement is not at all a bed of roses where the mother gets pampered for 1 entire month."	i-e-sha	reply	na	na	na	0.9991421699523926	no	no	no	na	offmychest	failed

It’s not a policy. It’s an option. Families that don’t want to do that the mother in law takes the initiative to do it. I never said a mother runs away with the baby and dad can’t get bonding time with his baby? It’s a hotel room you can visit and spend hours holding your baby. As a man, if we are being honest, a  majority of the baby work is done by the woman while the man is at work leaving his wife at home to cook(sometimes half asses meals that aren’t even nutritious for after birth), clean and take care of a new life all by herself…and in that situation I don’t see how you can bond with a baby from an office cubicle. After work, yes. Which you can still do. I just suggested OPs husband who cares about his sexual desires over her well being not go with her. He’s an ass. The point is to give woman an option to get help, learn to take care of a baby/breast feed, do beneficial exercises and get specialized meals with much needed nutrients. There’s nothing sexist about it whatsoever. Like 0%. It’s very beneficial to a woman’s physical and even mental health. It’s beneficial for a marriage after giving birth because it lessons the burden a new baby can bring. Postpartum depression is real and a serious thing. Could you enlighten me how this would be sexist? I do not have a western mindset so I am a bit slow at this. I too am a man and take no offense in it at all. I can’t imagine the trauma and pain giving birth can be for a woman…I guess I could imagine a basketball sliding out my dick slit…ouch.

Just because it’s generally ok doesn’t mean it’s ok for you in particular. Recommendations like that shouldn’t be treated as law.

We just remind eachother we fell in love for a reason, we were friends for a reason, and it’s worth the work to try to move forward positively. Be clear it isn’t him, you’re overwhelmed and not feeling physical, and it’s uncomfortable. Let him know how he can support you and let him know you’ll take steps to support his needs.

You have every right to be upset, sounds like his priorities are fucked up.

"My brother had to have surgery and I wanted to be there for him. So I ended up staying about 2 weeks.

I always knew my bsf had a thing for my husband, she’s admitted it multiple times but I would just laugh it off because surely my married best friend won’t fuck my husband, right?

I didn’t even catch them. My husbands girl best friend is just that insane that she casually admitted it to me as I was cleaning the kitchen when I got back. I thought she was kidding. No, she wasn’t. I asked my bsf if this was true over a phone call and she at first denied it then broke down SOBBING and fucking admitted to it!

I was so angry I threw all of my husbands shit into a big suitcase and tossed it on the front lawn. I locked the doors and piled a bunch of shit in front of it like the couch, an end table, etc so the dumb fuck couldn’t get in. Of course when he got home from work and couldn’t get in, he started panicking. He banged on the door and shouted for me to let him in. I just stayed upstairs with our dog and let him tire himself out.

Eventually he left and from what I know, he stayed the night at his girl best friends shitty apartment. They probably fucked too all while he was crying over me. Dumbass.

After a few weeks of him blowing up my phone and pleading with me, I finally let him come home and we talked. He was sobbing and apologizing to me. Said he was a sex addict and that he needed help. I told him I want him to go to therapy as well as us going to couples counseling. He agreed to it without any fight. He slept on the couch while I slept in our bedroom. My best friend hadn’t even made any moves to contact me or apologize for being the home-wrecker she is.

My husband ended up having some sort of work dinner party a week or so later that he needed to attend and invited me. This was the first time he’s ever invited me to anything like this. Pretty sure it’s because none of his female coworkers don’t know hes married. Or i’m assuming that’s the case because of how shocked they seemed to meet me.

At the dinner, his boss (50s?M) was chatting with me. Newly divorced and I asked him how that was, made sure to ask loud enough for husband to hear me. We ended up chatting all night and my husband ended up scurrying off from the dinner table and told me he was gonna go home and told me to get an uber home, clearly pissed off at me.

Needless to say, his boss was shocked at how he treated me and I couldn’t help but play up the sad lonely wife bit. It ultimately ended up in us going back to his house and hooking up. When I woke up that morning I did end up ubering home.

Since then, his boss has sent flowers to our home. Called me a few times. And my husband is completely aware of this and now the regret is starting to sink in. The guilt and worry has started to eat away at me. The revenge felt nice but now it’s clear it’s eating at the both of us. I’m gonna find a lawyer and start the process soon. I just needed to tell all this to someone that isn’t my family because they don’t even know the first detail about this.

Edit: Forgot to add that when we had our first therapy appointment, he never showed. He was gonna head there after visiting his sister who lives just a few miles from us. I sat and waited in that office for over an hour before I just went home and saw his ass sitting on the couch texting on his phone. He knew we had that appointment that day because I texted him multiple times about it. He had no intention whatsoever to fix this, give me closure or start fixing his “sex addiction”."

Your husband admitted to being a sex addict and did nothing to fix it. Meanwhile you have a man chasing you .  

Get with the boss. At least for starters

You will spend eternity trying to ""fix him"" while he continues to cheat on you. Or he'll find someone who lets him do what he wants and leave you anyway. 

It's on you how you decide to spend your years of life. 

Talk to a lawyer about divorce.

 Meanwhile, tell the boss you'd really enjoy pampering and a date with him at the end of the night in a new dress.

"This is all tragic and horrible. No one involved was “right”. There is no “fixing” any of this. This is “move to another state alone and start a new identity” kind of horrible. The thought that people feel her actions were excusable in any way after she exclaimed how hurt and betrayed she felt is ridiculous. The moment she made her decision to commit the exact same behavior the man who betrayed her committed, her feelings were null and void. The divorce judge is going to look at this and basically just tell everyone involved that everyone will leave with what they entered the relationship with. Lawyers will have to sort the rest.

If a partner cheats on you, that was a choice they consciously made. It’s not the fault of the person they cheat with. The cheater is 100% to blame as they made the choice to betray the relationship. The relationship is over. That level of trust violation destroys the relationship completely. If people want to reconcile and attempt to build a new relationship there after, they have to accept and move forward from the affair before any reconciliation can be attempted. Rarely can that happen. The reality is it will nearly always be best to end the relationship and move forward. Not be vengeful and commit the same act that the person committed further damaging everything and everyone.

With the level of judgement displayed, you two are the same. Both cheaters. Both liars. Both of you destroyed the relationship. You victimized each other and yourselves. He started the fire, you poured on the gasoline. Not to mention your hypocrisy towards your friend and his friend. As adults who made conscious decisions, I can’t feel bad for any of you. Brutal reality is what is needed. This a “take a step back, process what you’ve done, accept your accountability and build a new life” moment. You all have far more self realization and emotional work ahead of you than I think you realize. ESPECIALLY before attempting any other kind of relationship with anyone else!

I doubt sex addiction is his problem. He just wanted an excuse for his bad behavior. Revenge sex is never a good idea. I understand your disappointment when he didn't show up for therapy. He just didn't want to be ganged up on for his poor choice. That's when the divorce should have been started. It could have been started when you discovered his cheating.

"His BGF confessed that it happened out of the blue. 

Which to me spells it out that his BGF has always wanted to have him for herself. The plan was to ruin your relationship so she could have him for herself. Maybe sharing him with your exBFF every once in a while if the guilt doesn't ruin her. Although if her relationship goes under as well. Then perhaps they all end up together. Who knows. The spite sex with his boss definitely plays into her plan. 

I'm not going to defend anyone here. However the idea that two women you know and have sexual tension with both ask you to have a threesome with them while your wife is out of town for a few weeks? Saying no to that would be a challenge. Men are rarely solicited for sex. Even rarer solicited for a threesome with people who they have an unexpressed sexual attraction towards. 

He could say no because he doesn't want to ruin his marriage. However with two people reassuring him that they both would keep it a secret. That no one would find out... Tempting tempting tempting.

Could you say no to a fantasy come true that is hand delivered to you? Especially if those people promised that there would be no negative consequences? It looked like there would be none. Maybe you think that you can get away with it? 

Risky behavior is rarely about the negative consequences. The rewards simply need to increase high enough to be worth taking the risk.

"Gotcha I’m sorry to hear that. I’m 22m and not only does it make me sad to hear of a holy Union being broken but I have been betrayed but a good amount of gf’s and my family has been completely f’d cause of infidelity on my stepdads side.

So I know how it plays out there’s a good amount of times where marriage can be saved even through infidelity. But in this case his disregard to ur feelings and the lying and lack of effort. Sadly the things he isn’t doing are the things people need to be successful. So as much as I’m an advocate to try as much as you can.

From my personal experience, you did the best thing for your mental health and life. Just know your doing the right thing. My mom found herself obsessed with what my dad was doing then when he cheated on her again multiple times. She’s never been the same since. 

So I just wanted to say thank u for your reply and I wish you all the best of luck on your road to recovery. And a new life and just in case. 

Also I know I’m 22 and maybe we can’t relate on a person to person level but I’ve been around infidelity all my life and wanted to become a sex/normal therapist. So I know a bit regarding the why’s and just getting an extra perspective of infidelity and just letting it all out.

So i know im not much and u might still need a real therapist. But Ik that feeling of just “wtf” and feeling like whatever u did wasn’t enough for this person. So Ik it helps to brain fart out to someone. Don’t feel obligated to reach out but I figured I’d leave my private messages open if u needed it.

"Imo, I do not see that as stupid or childish. When they got married, they both made a commitment of trust, love, communication, and bonding. Marriage can be a scary thing because of betrayals and infidelity like this. Everyone wants to believe that it will never happen to them, so obviously they would put their trust into the person they love a lot. So yeah, being cheated on in one of the worst ways possible by three people in your life who you should've been the ones you could trust the mosr, blatantly been ignored when you tried your hardest to fix those relationships, and the person who you loved the most not even trying to fight for your marriage (even though it was over by the time that they cheated) would make anyone lose their head. I would make a petty, revenge-filled choice to if I was in OP's shoes, because sometimes it's not even about revenge, sometimes subconsciously you just want to understand where the other person came from, which in this case was experience cheating on someone else to see why they even bothered doing it in the first place (I'm not saying that that was OP's motive).

Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that life changing news can screw with a persons head and make them make choices that they wouldn't make with a straight head (and even with being level-minded, I still see OP's regret as a win), and that being emotionally ruined doesn't make you stupid or childish, maybe just making you lose sight of what you actually want to do."

"Rant incoming.

I did what you're 'supposed' to do, especially as a woman. (To be clear: I wanted to do it all, I was happy, it was the positively grand plan.) I focused on myself and my growth (therapy, group therapy, self reflection, actively deconstructing racism, etc.), I found a good career, I found and married a great man young, I supported him as he found his career, we bought a house, and my husband and I intentionally planned to get pregnant at 23. 

It seemed perfect! We followed the Hallmark guideline for life. The 'American Dream'. 

Then I had my baby. 36 hours of induced labor, a torn labrum in my hip, a only partially effective epidural- all until I blacked out the very second my baby was out of me. 

My physical health imploded, did you know that pregnancy and labor can do that? Can trigger something you already have or give you a new, fun disability to cope with? A lifetime of mild symptoms can become serious in a day and then you have a baby and a litany of physical disabilities (hEDS, POTS, Sjogren's as a primary auto-immune condition, fibromyalgia)  suddenly knock you on your ass even if you'd managed them unknowingly for years. Now you're in your mid twenties with a baby and depression and you can't lift a gallon of milk without dislocating your shoulder- your **strong** shoulder.

I can't chase my son around, I can't carry him, I can't spend time outside in the summer thanks to POTS heat sensitivity, I can't scrape snow off of my own car because of cold sensitivity, I can't join him in play at parks or trampoline places, and I spend hundreds of dollars every month on my health. I can't continue the career I previously worked in because I couldn't keep up with the physical demands of working around an office. I've needed surgery that took 5 weeks to get the pain under control enough to return to work. I have flares that keep me in bed due to the pain or extreme heart rate for weeks at a time. My immune system is so shot that I can go from relatively healthy to in the ER on oxygen in 24 hours- 'just' pneumonia. 

I'm told to be grateful- for my child, for motherhood, for the 'beautiful' changes to my body. Which should I be more grateful for- the daily pain or the loss of function? The surgery I had or the surgeries I will doubtless need?

This isn't the mother I wanted to be, the wife I wanted to be. I'm 27 with a damn shower chair. I don't want to be told to be grateful. I hear all the time- **it's not what your body looks like, it is what your body does for you.** My body doesn't work! My body doesn't do shit for me! And it also looks mediocre at best, and yeah, that's vain of me to care, but damnit I can't even have that, apparently. 

I get told that 'all mothers make sacrifices' and that 'you chose this' as if I ever could have known what this would do to me. I get told that I'm 'too young' to know what real pain is. I get told that I should have had a better career before I had my kid, as if I could have known that my previous career would be impossible to continue. 

I hate it. I hate that I did what I was told and then my body failed and there seems to be no safety nets waiting to help me or my family. I had a child, might as well disappear as far as society cares. I'm in pain, I can't function like I used to, and it's just getting worse and there's nothing that can be done about it. 5 years from now I'll be worse, 10 years worse over, who even knows where I'll be in 40 or 60. Yeah, you can die in labor, but you can also live. You can also live with pain and deterioration for the rest of your miserable life. 

Then people have the audacity to tell other people they have to have kids even if that isn't what they want? They have the audacity to demand that I have more? (What, so I can lose more function and not even be able to care for my kid as I do now?) I never agreed with telling people how to live their lives, but as someone who did what she was told by society to do, I can confirm that you absolutely can't win. I wanted this, I wanted the picket fence and the child and the whole thing, and I have no idea how I would get through the day if that weren't the case.

So it comes down to this:

One: I'm disabled and pissed about it, and if one more person tells me to 'be grateful' or 'look on the bright side' I'm going to explode  
Two: You might as well live your life how you want, because you can never guarantee your future"	HelloBeautifulChild	post	32.473295684951665	female	White	0.9977194666862488	na	na	na	148	offmychest	failed
Let yourself be pissed, that is SUCH a hard series of events. It totally fucking sucks, and it makes so much sense to feel the loss of your expectations deeply. That’s a lot to grieve. I don’t know if it will be up your alley, but tiktok has a wonderful chronic illness (and specifically hEds/POTs) community.

Women who deal with issues postpartum deserve to have support and adequate healthcare to help get through the upcoming days.

I hope the best for you and I hope that you’ll be able to find a way to navigate these issues.

I’m so so sorry, OP. As I was reading the part with “it’s not what your body looks like” I was thinking was the very same that you wrote next: **your body doesn’t work**. Not like it should, not like mine or other people’s. You have every right to be pissed. Acknowledging that doesn’t take away from the love you have for your son, and to those who may imply otherwise are wrong. I didn’t see anyone doing that in the comments, but I also just understand that people are dicks + appalled at any conversation surrounding your child that is less than perfect and enthusiastic. The two are by no means mutually exclusive, or mutual feelings at all. They can both be true at the same time. I’m sending you and your family lots of love.

"Honestly it’s the dishonesty of the entire system that allows things like this to happen. I’ve seen it so many times. You’re not alone. Everyone just goes around pretending that pregnancy and childbirth aren’t the riskiest things most anyone will ever do in their lives, and then they shrug and say “oh no! Anyway…” when these things happen to women. 

Women’s teeth fall out. Women get diabetes. Women get prolapses. Women tear their clitorises. Women permanently lose control of their bladders. Women DIE! Women SUFFER AND DIE. And instead of saying hey — before doing this you should have a full list of the risks! Society thinks it’s better to keep you all in the dark because otherwise who but the rarest and craziest would ever do it?

ETA I don’t believe women have the knowledge base to give INFORMED CONSENT to pregnancy.

I’ve had lupus, or at least started showing symptoms around 17. The first few years I was able to manage pretty well, but after I had my second my health went down hill so fast. I was angry. So angry for a long time. Living with 24/7 pain will do that to you let alone everything else you’re going through. I sympathize with everything you’re feeling. I think most people with chronic illness go through a similar especially your comment about your body. I just recently accepted the loss of my hair. It hit me harder than dealing with most other symptoms. Like you said the physical aspects seem vain, but for fucks sake when it look my hair I was pissed. It’s taken so much away from me. It’s impacted how much I’m able to keep with my kids physically. It’s affected me mentally, and physically. It was the straw that broke the camel’s back. The one thing that I really loved about my appearance was forever altered too. I’d love to tell you not to worry about your health, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t still do the same. My autoimmune, and POTS are relatively well managed, but still. Once your health is “gone” or no longer what it once was it’s a legitimate worry. I just hope you know that you’re not alone. For what it’s worth your post made me feel a lot better just knowing someone out there really understands some of the same struggles I go through on a day to day basis.

Hey, I have lots of the same issues, my primary is fibromyalgia and balance issues. I've had them for 6 years and I'm only 21.

I pushed myself too far with sports while infected with some kind of flu and now, 6 years on, I struggle to get through a full day and need rest periods, I'm in tears randomly dealing with pain, and I have a walking stick I got at 17 for balance or I will fall and injure myself.

"Hey, I became disabled at 30 as a woman. Not from childbirth, but what it does to a woman’s body and the complications are not talked about enough. Plus you have a baby demanding attention and energy while your body has been through so much. I could barely take care of myself let alone a baby. I can’t even imagine how hard it’s been for you even as I am having flashbacks to sitting, exhausted in a shower chair. If I showered at all.

My issue was different, but left damaged by a tumor battle. People didn’t understand - not sensitive to my disability and needs, and didn’t want to hear of it. Told I should be grateful too I survived. I am not grateful that I went through what I did. Living with pain and disability is hard. Looking at your altered body, exhausted, all those things. The emotional as well as physical trauma. Healing does take a long time, and there may be permanent issues. I still deal with confidence problems, have fears about not being able to support myself, and have lots of pain as well as a damaged limb. I know people look at me differently too. I have heard awful comments and those people are no longer in my life. Yes, so much is expected of women and I feel like a failure even when it’s not my fault. And real pain? My god these people have no idea to be saying that. Ignorant.

Take each day as it comes, each task. Give yourself credit for getting through and making progress, even the small things. I did therapies like biofeedback and EMDR to address the traumas. Has helped to have a dog too but you’ve got enough with the baby. I hope you have a support network like friends and family? Or join a support group. It’s ok to say it’s too much and ask for help.

"I understand how you feel. I had my son at 19, and twin girls at 23. After my twins, my health took a deep dive. Pregnancy does A LOT on the body. Eventually (10 years later) I was diagnosed with POTS myself. Do you have ehlers danlos too? I ask because you mentioned the shoulder dislocation. They tend to be a comorbidity. I have both and some other health issues as well.  
I am 40 on Saturday. I have survived. It hasn’t been easy and I’ve had to learn my bodies limits  very well. I still have very rough days. 
I’m on propranolol on a higher dose 24 hour time release, and that has seemed to help more than other meds my the stupid fast heart rate. The heat intolerant stuff totally stinks along with all the other poo related to POTS. Are you a part of any POTS or EDS FB pages?

Find a therapist who specializes in chronic illness also. I did a stand up comedy class years ago, and maybe that’s why I also find a joke within my worst days.

If you aren’t a part of those FB groups I would encourage you to join them. They are full of people who truly understand what you are going through.

"I’m so sorry to hear of your struggles.  And fuck all those people telling you to be grateful. Honestly who says that to someone who got disabled from childbirth?! It’s ridiculous. Be mad. Be angry. Be upset.  

I haven’t had that happen to me.  But similar position but in my 30s, and my son ended up with a rare genetic disorder and is disabled and will be dependent on me for life.  I love him but it took a long time to let go of the resentment of wanting to be a mother, and feeling like I ended up a carer instead.  I have moved on from that feeling and we found joy, but I still remember the rage at people telling me to basically get over it and I chose this. Really?? I chose for my son to be disabled, to watch him lose his speech and not know if he’ll ever speak again? To watch him need intensive physio and have to work daily with him just to do the most basic things like walk and feed himself, things everyone takes for granted? 

Honestly people suck with dealing with hard feelings.  I think our current society prizes achievement and kicking goals so much, that the other side of life like illness, disability, grief and death, are so unfamiliar that people don’t know how to deal with it.  Everyone is told to expect a fairytale and lots of people end up with loss.  

It may be a bit out there, but I use the Nemechek protocol developed by a doctor to reduce systemic inflammation in my boy to keep him healthy and developing, it may be worth looking into that because I know there are adults who use it for

"I am a mom of 2 boys age 3&5. When I was pregnant with my youngest my life changed. My only kidney had a 3cm stone rolling around unable too pass. My heath rapidly declined. I had hypermesis as well. My mom had to move in with us because I could hardly stand let alone pick my son up and take care of his basic needs. My husband works midnights an hour away from our home and works 70 hours a week. I’ve always been a stay at home mom and have always done 100% of the cleaning, cooking & childcare when my husband is gone.  I was admitted to the hospital 30 times in the 37 weeks I was pregnant. 6 weeks after I had him I had major kidney surgery to remove the stone which left me with a punctured lung and subsequent scar tissue & very bad nerve damage in my kidney. Couple this with 8 herniated discs in my back from my previous career as a hair stylist- this lead me to my new life as a stay at home mom with chronic pain. I struggled for a year  with no medical help for the pain. I was extremely angry, depressed and pissed at the world. I no longer could keep up with my house chores. I struggled too lift my kids. Any spare moment I had help with my kids was me laying on the couch or in bed. Watching my mom and husband do all
The things with my kids I couldn’t. At one point i considered taking my own life Becuase I felt so lost. Everything I was good at was gone. My family doctor sent me too a pain clinic. I finally got treated for my chronic pain. My youngest just turned 3. I’m about 70% back to myself and that’s about as good as it will get. My back will get worse and we’ve recently discovered some other health issues causing chronic pain in my hip. I’m here to tell you with proper management of your pain, you will be able to do the things with your child that you want too do. U may not be able to run around, but u can make those connections with your child in a way that your body can handle. I use too sit on the floor and play cars with my oldest for hours. I can’t do that anymore so now we sit on the couch with a special table my husband built that makes it easy for me to play Lego with him for hours. He loves it.

So, as a 54 yr old woman that has Hashimoto’s and who went undiagnosed, since I was 20…and got a new issue with each pregnancy…I don’t blame my children…I blame DOCTORS and insurance companies!!! Pretty sure my son, who was over 10 lb when he was born, tore things in my hips, as well. After having my hysterectomy…I have even WORSE issues! My hormones DUMPED, when my hormones are off-I get suicidal! Every damn joint hurts! I thank God I wear a name tag, because I worry I’ll forget my damn name someday, because my brain fog is RIDICULOUS! On top of everything else, I found out I have ADHD…which is worse since menopause!! Yaaaayyy! 😒  So, you can be mad…but it’s not the babies fault. We (women) are treated like 2nd class citizens in regards to the medical field….and in other areas in life, as well. Be angry about that!!

"I gotta say, as someone who wanted the same thing, and became severally disabled (or at least was finally diagnosed) a year after my last miscarriage, I fucking get it. I've been pissed off the last 3yrs. My husband and I planned to start trying this year... But then I found out I have a rare genetic brain disease. On top of that I finally got my fibromyalgia dx (always suspected it). When I wasn't in remission yet I'd take a day every month (as I didn't have periods thanks to my bc) to just cry, scream, and let myself ask ""why me?!"" It helped a lot. I sometimes did it alone but other times my husband would be there to run my back and give me tissues. It's not fair. It's terrifying. But I started finding a community, because holy shit we need it. Being disabled in this country is fucking brutal. I connected with other people like us, who were on here, FB, Twitter, and discord. Discord servers felt safer to just vent and not be judged. The dismissive doctors and nurses, the disappearance of family and friends, and the waking up to flare ups on important days are things that thankfully are deeply understood by others (unfortunately not our senators or in general our government).

I’m sorry. I have hEDS and POTS and they’re a big part of why I’ve decided not to have children. Anecdotally though, while I haven’t had a baby I’ve been very disabled by these conditions in the past and I’m doing a lot better at the moment. Obviously these are incurable conditions, and I may well get worse again. But I know that improvements are possible. Don’t give up.

"The illnesses you describe are mostly so-called “rare diseases” that have genetic links but that often don’t emerge until a trauma happens.

just remember not to limit your possibilities , seek peace and determinedly grow strongly as you can.

if you need to try alternative medical routes, and fuck anyone who degrades that option they can go suck the system off themselves, the cutting edge of western medicine isnt the peak of anything. and in a couple decades they will weep at the belligerent mistakes they made , its a constant cycle, so go alternative, find some good people who want you heal."

Honest, having your baby and all is great but there are realities. Yes we are happy but we are human, as mothers we have to be tough no matter what for our kids but its hard. It fucking sucks ass, surgery, postpartum, depression, and drastic change in body. You have a right to be pissed and sad, but please for your sake try to pish through. Just have to keep pushing through, its all we can do as humans and as a mother. It really is fucking hard, its stressful, tiring but push through. Theres no other way to say it but it s extremely hard. Its the reality, honest for me who only had a c section was already tough on me and even afterwards.

"At 28 I went from a fully functioning adult with a career to nearly completely blind and a laundry list of health issues in less than six months. I too became enraged every time someone told me to be positive, or made stupid remarks about god giving us what we we can handle, etc. The unabashed pity was the worst and most demoralizing, I really didn’t need anyone else chiming in and telling me my life was over, I obsessively played those thoughts in my own head every waking moment of the day. 

It doesn’t ever go away, I wish I could lie and say it will but I won’t do that because when I was where you are I desperately needed someone to be honest with me and I was alone.

You have so much grief to work through. The 5 stages of grief weren’t created with widows in mind. It was created for those that need to come to terms with losing something of themselves. Whether it’s accepting an impending death, being unable to walk again, or being diagnosed with a multitude of ailments that make it impossible to live your previous life.

So be angry. Feel the anger. Cry all the tears of anger you need to. You’re allowed to. You don’t need to look at the bright side of things, you need to survive. And you are surviving.

Perhaps when you get through the stages you’ll see the bright side everyone is talking about. But that’s not right now. Right now you need to be acknowledged for all that you’re going through.

It for me took her at least a year over time to get her color back, she is fair skinned but she was ghost white when she had her baby.

The American Dream is more like a nightmare when you have a rare diagnosis.

"Im 18F with hEDS, T1 narcolepsy, CPTSD, dysautonomia, endometriosis, and potentially MCAS and achalasia. I cannot speak to my own experiences about motherhood, but I can tell you my mother's. She likely has many of the conditions that I do as well. She needed an emergency c-section for me and her scars never healed. She developed a horrible sucralose intolerance during my childhood (that did fortunately go away). She couldnt join me in my childhood play, she had awful dislocations and increasing cataplexy episodes. It did eventually improve, but even now she still deals with the fallout. 

I spent my entire childhood believing I was fully abled and neurotypical, but somehow I always found myself lagging behind in physical/social areas and bounding ahead in academics and applied skills. When the other kids ran, I coughed up lungfuls of water and nearly passed out. I never understood why they didnt talk to me. I slept in class, but I was fully aware of what was happening while I slept. I could be solidly asleep, my teacher would wake me up and I could repeat by rote what theyd just said while I was asleep, and the other kids hated me for it. Life was hard, and it was hard for my mom not knowing how to help me or herself.

I hate it. My mom hates it. Disabilities, especially invisible ones, are hell. No one deserves them. No woman should be told to have a child, another child, or ANYTHING to do with her own damn body. No one   should use hindsight as a guiding light for OTHER PEOPLE. Its frankly insulting to criticize someone's past decisions based on the results of those desicions in a case like this; what's done is done and they should keep their mouths shut about shit they dont know.

You will find ways to get through the worst times; you are strong, and you have a community here. I encourage you to check out the subreddits for EDS/ehlers-danlos, POTS, fibromyalgia, and sjorgens if you havent already. These have been invaluable communities for me and my mom.

I have no proper ways to help. I don’t know how you feel, but I have some suggestions of ways to spend time with your son.

Ideas to spend time with your son (that aren’t running around, but he’ll remember them)
- Bedtime stories (I still fondly remember my mom reading Charolette’s Web with me)
- Teaching him about his favorite things (if he loves dinosaurs, find some cool ones to tell him about, or even a movie to rent)
- Crafts (me and my mom would do these together, and you can find a lot of crafting supplies that are light)
- Movie nights (Me and my dad still do these, and I’m 20)

I was an admittedly weird kid, and my parents (bless them) always took an interest in the things I found cool. You won’t have the relationship you wanted with your son, but you can still have a beautiful one. I don’t remember playing on the playground with my parents, but I remember how much their support meant to me. Their love of me, and their attempt at understanding me made more of an impact than anything physical they did.

If more women knew the horrible side effects that could happen when giving birth to a baby, I think they would do a hell of a lot more thinking on the pros and cons of having a child.

"You're so so right and I've been known to go on about this subject. At least in the US, most of the population by far cannot give informed consent to pregnancy because we just aren't told. It almost feels like we're intentionally kept in the dark, so that we don't decide not to risk it.

"Thank you for sharing your experience too. I think your point about your hair is so poignant. It does feel vain to care so much but also it can be that last straw. It's also so hard to look at our kids and think ""I swear, I was going to be better for you""- even if our kids would never think that about us.

On a humorous note, I had a wrist surgery and pre-surgery I couldn't flick people off with my left hand. Now I can about 50% do it (my fingers are all sorts of weird) and I find so much joy in that even though I never do it- just the thought that I can do it with both hands is hilariously comforting.

">You'll forget about how painful labour was after you look at your baby for the first time

What's wild is, in my experience, the hormones actually did this in the sense that a rational person would never be willing to go through that twice and for a little while I was still eager to have a second kid. I even look back on pregnancy with nostalgia, and isn't that wild? But I certainly wouldn't consider this as a positive reason to tell someone to do it! ""Your body is tear apart and then your hormones will convince you it was good."" Is not the selling point people think it is.

"That is such a wild story to me, I have not thought of pregnancy to that extreme before. (Which is saying something, because I can go on about how people downplay the seriousness of pregnancy.)

I appreciate your good intentions but I assure you this is not a trauma I am passing on to him, and not a reminder that I need at this time. I have sick relatives and am quite aware of the dangers there. I do go to therapy and this is a big part of what we work on. It is important for me to be able to acknowledge just the impact that this has had on me and carving out time and space to focus on just that, in a space that he will not be a part of, is not damaging to him at all. In fact, part of ensuring that I don't pass the emotional weight of this on to him is ensuring that I process it myself at appropriate times- like online after he's gone to bed for the night."

"Thank you so much for sharing this.

"Thank you for sharing. I do have EDS (hypermobile type) and I am a part of Facebook groups for both EDS and POTS. If I remember correctly, my PCP had me on propranolol for the month between a really bad POTS flare and when I saw my cardiologist for the first time. The medication helped but my cardiologist switched me to another that has been more helpful. (Though as of late it's not working as well, I'm thankful that POTS is relatively common and we haven't near exhausted our treatment options.)

My therapist doesn't specialize in chronic illness, but I did go through a few on my way to her and she is actually really good with it. She has some experience and has done a lot of research. I totally agree that you need a therapist who knows about it, or is willing to listen and learn, because I've had therapists insist I need to try turmeric and yoga and others who just hummed in agreement and had nothing to say. 

When I first saw that they were noticing a link between COVID and POTS I wasn't surprised. My understanding is that POTS can be caused by any high stress experience- labor, pneumonia, a bad flu, cancer/cancer treatment, etc and so COVID made sense for me. I hope they're able to find even more information about it, here's hoping they also start doing more research on EDS too."

"Oh for sure I blame the doctors/patriarchy and never my son! He didn't ask to be born, and he certainly didn't purposefully have a big-ol head. (I do like, maybe 2%, blame my big headed husband for that lol.) He's a lovely little boy and I would never dump that weight on him. 

I feel you on brain fog- I've been known to briefly forget how to read when it gets really bad. Hormone issues are also a big struggle, I hope you were able to find some balance since your hysterectomy. 

I get screened for another auto-immune disorders so often, at this point I think my doctors low-key want me to have another just so it makes more sense to them. I've been told it's very odd to have as many typical auto-immune struggles as I do and only have Sjogren's as a formal condition, but of course there's mild rumblings that hEDS may be auto-immune adjacent so who knows. (Not us! Because there's no money to be made so why would we research it? 🙄🙃) At this point I'm just thankful for vitamins, practical self-care, DMARD medication, and keeping an eye on things. 

So sorry about all you had to go through, women for sure have an uphill battle to get diagnosed when it comes to chronic illness and disability.

"So I appreciate that you mean well, but this is a big part of the problem. 

Just some facts that are going to take a minute to explain but I'd really appreciate it if you'd read this (I'll do a TL;DR at the bottom if you don't want to), and I mean this 'matter of fact/educational' not 'angry' (like my post): I will not recover. I will not go into remission. I have a genetic condition, there is no cure, and the nature of it means that I will get worse. hEDS is not progressive in that the disease itself gets worse, but it causes permanent injuries and damage that can't be repaired. So my body will slowly break down for the remainder of my life in a way that cannot be wholly repaired or cured. When I tear a tendon I can't just get a new one put in, and a joint replacement surgery is both very very very hard on the body and a trade off/absolute last resort. Physical therapy and other treatment (braces, hot cold therapy, etc.) can help both lesson symptoms and slow down the body's natural degradation that will happen when it loses support it needs but it won't get my body back to where it was with the tendon. And every time I dislocate a joint, there are tiny micro abrasions to the surrounding tissue and tendons that over time make it more likely to happen again. I talked in terms of 5-10- 40 years because yes. It's not linear. December might feel better than August (I'm actually optimistic it might- my heat sensitivity is no joke) but all in all 2030 will be worse than 2020. This is fact.

I appreciate that there is a lot of value in alternative medicine, I appreciate that sometimes (often) doctors in hospitals are wrong. After all, for 20ish years they said I was exaggerating injury pain, that it was 'just' sciatica (it was a torn hip tendon and subluxxing my hip joints), that I was being dramatic about my exercise intolerance (POTS). I am well aware that drugs and surgery are not the only options- there is physical therapy (for many people, yoga or weight lifting fills this role), there is heat and cool treatments, there is weed and other natural remedies that do legitimately boost your body. 

However, and this is the crux of it- your 'hope' that you're offering by saying that I need to explore all options and not give up is perceived as both condescending and cruel. **Condescending**: It assumes that I haven't looked into those avenues, as if I stopped being able to carry my baby boy and just gave up there. I have tried alternatives, and though those alternatives can be helpful for many people, they are not a cure for me and you're just going to have to trust that. There's also this idea that I'm wrong about my own health. That my years of digging and begging and reading peer reviewed research meant for doctors and talking to other people who lived through my lived experience is less valuable than the idea that we should always have hope. That the time I have spent finding the incredible providers that I have, and the time all of us have spent dedicating ourselves to my betterment means nothing against optimism. That my judgement in finding these good people means nothing. I have good people in my corner, there is no reason to assume that I don't. **Cruel**: I am not getting better, and now, I not only have to go through the trauma of reminding myself of that. Reminding myself that I lost the life I thought I would get to live, reminding myself that I am going to suffer and we will mitigate where we can but having zero pain will absolutely never happen. I also have to do this process for you, just like I have to do this emotional labor for every other well meaning person (my grandmother, random people on the street, friends who just don't understand) who hears about this. 

You aren't an expert in the conditions that I have, and I know this because if you were then you wouldn't say that I need to keep an eye out for recovery. Please, before you attempt to give someone health advice (**especially** someone who is both disabled and reaching out to the world because they're mentally struggling with their lot in life), do a google, and then also maybe don't. 

# TL;DR There are people who will not get better, it's not a conspiracy, it's fact. Telling us to have hope is not kind, it's condescending and cruel. I appreciate that you mean well, I'm not mad at you, but I hope that you learn from today not to do this in the future.

&#x200B;

As a final note: It's not morally bad for me to accept that I'm disabled, it doesn't make you a bad person to accept that I am disabled. Disabled isn't a bad word, and for many of us fighting it will only mean more pain and more damage that could have been avoided."

"Thank you very much! You're very right about social media, I'm a big fan of Facebook groups and TikTok videos. (Though of course it's always a mixed bag.) 

My understanding about IVIG (and please correct me if I'm wrong) treatments for POTS is that there's a ton of evidence that it helps but there are some risks involved and beyond that, insurance doesn't like to cover it. If nothing else, a good saline IV (not the same thing) is always a good time for me. Between the POTS and the Sjogren's I'm always needing more hydration, my doctors constantly remind me to ""increase volume"". I have had worsening POTS symptoms over the last 6 months or so, when I can finally miss a half day of work I'm going to follow up with my cardiologist and ask about different/additional things I can do because my beta blocker is no longer doing enough.

I don't understand people, you can love and cherish your child but still hate the pregnancy and labor that got them there. Pregnancy is a major medical event, it's literally one of the most painful things a body can go through, and it changes your body, able bodied or no, your body will be different! Women pee when they laugh too hard after they've had kids, the pelvic floor is weakened, hips become wider, shoe sizes can change permanently, you can end up with insane skin disorders (my sister developed a full body rash post pregnancy that still flares up to this day. Her son is now 3), illnesses that you didn't know you had can flare up like in your case, and so many other repercussions from that full body medical event. So people who hate on you for hating the process can eat dirt, that's so rude, pregnancy is a fully life changing thing.

"OMG, I love this response. I have multiple autoimmune diseases that all went haywire after the birth of my third 15 years ago, though I'm almost positive that I have had symptoms since I was a teenager. I had severe post-childbirth prolapses as a result of my connective tissue diseases. I required a year of humiliating testing and finally a major surgery to repair them. I've also had several other major surgeries due to complications from my autoimmune diseases. Four major surgeries on top of having to live with chronic pain from my chronic, incurable, progressive diseases. People don't get it. At all. They mean well when they say certain things, but they just aren't listening. I believe it is because people are terrified that something like this might happen to them and they can't process it on a deeper level.

Your story reminds me of my older sister, who showed signs of lupus for years and it was always dismissed, downplayed and she was called a liar. Biggest one was her face and arm rash that she had for about 5-6 months, they all said was ringworm but somehow despite being highly contagious, nobody else caught it. She was constantly using antifungals and being told she was obviously doing it wrong. One day it just seemed to clear up. Later when she ended up pregnant, about 6-8weeks in she got her wierd ringworm rash again. That's when the Drs realized something was up and did an actual biopsy and it came back that it was lupus."

I just want to say how much I appreciate you saying this. That genetic brain disease of mine? It's neurodegenerative. It's hard knowing your present self is the best you're going to be physically despite treatments being available. A lot of people with my brain disease (idiopathic intracranial hypertension) have hEDS as well, so I'm really familiar with how life can be with it. I have come to terms that I am going to get progressively worse over time, even in remission. But a lot of people press their hopes on me when I have talked about it because they're worried and scared of the finality of it. Neither you and I are giving up on ourselves. We're just accepting the limitations of the treatments we have available to us. It's okay for us or the people around us to be scared, but we should be able to talk about it freely. No guilt or shame from the well intended hopes. None of it. It makes me feel like I'm not trying hard enough. We're doing the best we can, and I think you handled this eloquently.

Yeah, my friend has a supply of saline and also IV antibiotics that she uses as needed. IVIG can have side effects like any treatment, so you definitely need to discuss it with your doctor. I just know that for my friend, it makes a huge difference in her ability to function and stay healthy. A doctor took her off, and she ended up in her wheelchair.

You do in fact have to learn to be disabled and happy after having a “normal” abled body for most your life. It’s been a few years back, but it was oddly helpful.

I think people tell you to be grateful as a way of comforting you, maybe be grateful that you have that baby of yours, it's like 'look on the bright side kind of thing. ' Sometimes it's hard to find the words to say to comfort someone. Motherhood is brutal. My body is forever changed due to a bad episiotomy done by a nervous nurse. And I live in a third world country where the maternal mortality rate is high. So I get told to be grateful since I didn't die in childbirth and my baby lived.

">though I'm almost positive that I have had symptoms since I was a teenager

I feel this so so much- I don't know about your conditions but for me at least the hEDS has to have always been there because it's in my genetic code. I've always had faulty collagen, it was just that it didn't spike up. So I had my kiddo and suddenly life-long symptoms were worse, and then you get diagnosed and you're looking back on your pre-diagnosis like like ""oh, my god- I didn't realize but it's true!""

People absolutely don't get it and I think it comes from the fear. There's this idea that if you do everything right you won't get sick, so if someone is permanently sick then they must be doing something wrong because it couldn't possibly be random. But it is, and that's the scary part. 

Thank you so much, I hope you're able to give yourself compassion too. ❤ (I know it's so easy for me to give it to others, and to tell them to give themself peace, and then I see my kitchen sink and berate myself.)"

"It was interesting what you said about sciatica, because I suffered from it as a teen, too! It never occured to me that it could be due to hypermobility or a manifestation of my connective tissue diseases and not just a slipped disc or something. Who has sciatica when they're 15?

I'm wondering if I have undiagnosed EDS because pregnancy and childbirth fucked. me. up. Rectal prolapse, prolapsed uterus, vaginal vault prolapse, and  a rectocele that required sacropolpoplexy, a bladder sling, and rectal prolapse repair. It feels like I have enough mesh in my body to circle the earth three times. If you don't mind me asking, what kind of genetic testing did you have to find out about your hEDS?

When you mentioned condescension in your previous post, I almost shouted out loud in appreciation. I have become so isolated because I am sick and tired of hearing, ""Have you tried this diet? Yoga? Coffee enemas?"" It implies that I \*want\* to be sick because I haven't explored every option available to me no matter how ridiculous.

Now take all of these ""suggestions"" I get about my health and double them because on top of all of my medical problems, I have an autistic son and my parenting is constantly called into question. It is emotionally exhausting.

It's taken me a very long time and lots of therapy to learn to give myself grace. Luckily, I have an amazingly supportive partner who picks up the slack, and then some. I still feel guilt, but I began to understand that the amount of emotional support I give my family is priceless.

">If you don't mind me asking, what kind of genetic testing did you have to find out about your hEDS?

I do not mind at all! The gene for hEDS has not been identified and my doctors were not concerned about vEDS so I have not done an EDS panel. It was a ""clinical diagnosis"" based on my symptoms, what's helped them, past injuries, other illnesses (since things like POTS and fibro are common comorbidities), and family history. That said I did do a myopathy panel that included some types of EDS to try and sort out some atrophy in my arm that did not flag anything. 

If you think you have hEDS I think the best place to start is the diagnostic criteria, the Ehlers Danlos Society has it on their website. Don't get too stuck on the Brighton scale- there's a lot of key joints it doesn't check at all, though it is still useful. I wish you luck- EDS or something else, you deserve to know what's going on with your body.

>Now take all of these ""suggestions"" I get about my health and double them because on top of all of my medical problems, I have an autistic son

As an autistic person, I have really strong feelings about parents of autistic people. Yes, there's a lot of shitty parents out there and Autism Speaks is terrible and so on and so forth (this is a different conversation entirely), but I think we treat parents of autistic children so terrible. We blame them, as if autism is a character flaw, and we offer no peace. No understanding or support is offered. I'm glad you have a supportive partner, and I'm glad you recognize the value you bring to your home.

"Soooo I (f42) am Caucasian. Went to schools in an overwhelmingly Caucasian area, had mostly Caucasian friends as a teen in the 90’s. I don’t think we had one Asian kid in my high school, and I could count the African American students on one hand… Just a very simple, small, homogeneous working class area.

The general story is: a small group of us decided to go camping. One African American (male) friend, 2 white females & 3 white males. All working class-to-middle class families. Our one white male buddy whips out a packet of ramen, smashes it up with seasoning & starts eating it dry. We did tease him- but that was more because for some reason he wrapped himself in one of those silver reflective emergent blankets that you typically only see in tragic/trauma/survival situations. Not sure why ol’ Steve did this, as his family had more money than any of the rest of ours did. He’s a doctor now…

Which is to say, eating ramen dry may not be for everyone, but it definitely isn’t weird either… per my gawky white pal in the 90’s.

"American, non-white here. I have no experience other than eating Maruchan brand ramen packets cooked as per the instructions—not dry. Not sure if I’m on the same page.

If so, I’d like to digress from your point like others have, but to touch on the health aspect that I haven’t seen in the responses I read—did not read all.

One other large aspect beyond your social inclusion—or exclusion rather, is the amount of sodium contained in the little f’ing flavor packet. Most people don’t monitor daily sodium intake—there’s a recommended amount for an average person. Being a betting man, this packet will put a lot of Americans over the daily threshold of the recommended amount daily sodium intake (barring any medical conditions).

African Americans are prone to high blood pressure. In general terms (because I don’t know your diet and I’m not a doctor), I’d definitely be wary of consuming to many ramen packets with the flavor pack added. A quick google search revels: “Instant ramen noodles are very high in sodium, with one package containing 1,760 mg of sodium, or 88% of the 2-gram recommendation suggested by the WHO.Feb 2, 2023”

More than likely this would put your blood pressure over 120/80. Spend extended bouts of time, week’s months at or above the aforementioned levels, and you’ll be looking at complications not limited to organ failure.

Long story short, watch your sodium intake with ramen that includes the flavor pack.

Breaking spaghetti pasta in front of traditional Italians could be perceived as offensive but eating noodles like this in my experience (whilst it could be seen as somewhat lazy) isn't that much of an outrage in most oriental cultures to warrant bullying.

" I'm Asian. Singaporean-Filipino to be exact. I eat ramen this way too cuz it taste so good. Sometimes, I add nacho powder or garlic seasoning. Then, crush the ramen inside and shake it.

You can eat it raw, eat it like Canton noodles, or with soup like Ramen. 

If your friends are Asian and bullied you out for this. That's embarrassing on their end. They don't know their culture. If your friends aren't Asian and ridicule you for it. Well, they're idiots cuz there's many ways to eat a ramen. The thing about being Asian is that we have  traditions, but we also like innovation. That's why we have such a thing as fusion or modern style. That includes our food. But overall, whatever race they are, bullying is not okay in friendship. They're not good friends to begin with.

"I was an underachiever throughout my school life due to a chronic medical condition. My father was a brilliant student and I always let him down. Failed in class 11th, was always at the bottom of my class, and got bullied for my medical condition as well as my marks. Finally, I gave up my engineering dreams to pursue design.

In college, I felt like I had another chance as I always loved arts and culture. I was an above-average student, specialised in VFX, and passed out with great marks and fantastic placements from some of the top international VFX studios in India.

That's when I had a terrible breakup. My ex cheated on me and got pregnant. Her family found out and she blamed me as she didn't want to tell her parents that she cheated with someone else. I had a massive emotional breakdown as I felt guilty for ruining her life. Her family was out for my blood and they constantly threatened and abused me. I come from a conservative family so I felt helpless and decided to take my own life for becoming a failure once again. My suicide attempt failed as well and I had my stomach pumped in a hospital after I took a toxic cocktail of drugs. A few months later I found out that she'd actually cheated on me with her ex and the pregnancy wasn't my fault. I still felt terrible for losing my ex as she was my first proper girlfriend and I really loved her. I never told her family the truth and moved on with my life by burying myself in work.

Thankfully, I was pretty good at VFX and was fortunate enough to work on some really reputed international projects, Hollywood films even. But two years later, the recession hit the animation industry and I was laid off. I tried my hand at freelancing, architectural walkthroughs, interior designing etc. and I was managing fine. But I lacked the routine that a proper job brings. And I was tired of looking for work all the time.

After much consideration, I gave up my VFX career as well since the recession had resulted in a hiring freeze across major studios in India for almost two years. Many were shut down. So I took a wild shot and entered the advertising industry as a copywriter. I had zero knowledge of marketing, ads, or even proper English. But I learnt on the job, read a ton of books, and put in sleepless nights to become better at copywriting.

It's been 9 years since that day. I am a successful creative director at probably the most famous ad agency in the world. I have won a bunch of international awards, and gotten a lot of recognition within the industry. I don't earn as much as software engineers at Google, but I earn enough to live a decent life. I live in a nice house with my pet, play a ton of video games, watch a lot of films, go for high-altitude treks twice a year, and I'm happy that I get paid for writing ad films. It's not boring at all and it keeps me on my toes. I'm not the biggest fan of corporate red tape and late-stage capitalism but when I see my ad on TV, I feel good. Meanwhile, I also got into a great and fulfilling relationship after staying single for 7-8 years. Life's good.

Having dealt with failure so many times, I'm always thinking about the worst-case scenario. I'm not the most positive person in the room. But at the same time, I've realised that failure is the most motivating thing that can happen to you. Whether it's academic, societal, professional or personal, failure will always push you to become a better version of yourself"	flarengo	post	23.566375054301034	male	White	0.01018567755818367	na	na	na	5	offmychest	failed

 I met a guy a few months ago and we started talking as friends. After a while he told me he liked me. I just finished a situation  with someone else before (onlinr as well) so I didn't immediatlt respond to his advances. But with time I started liking him too. He was nice and kind with me, we called a lot and laughed togheter. He said he wants to have kids 100% in a few years. He is 25 and I am 19 so I told him I am young and I feel like I might never want kids. Pregnancy scares me and I still kinda see myself as a kid still. He completelt changed towards me since then and he is not as romantic and nice as he used to be. He said he would leave his partner if she didn't want to have kids in at least 5 years. I think that's messed up and it makes me feel like he just wanta to date to have babies. He is very kind and has a good heart but this really made my heart sink.

This is actually good. He’s not wasting your time. You two want different things in life, and if you two have such a big life incompatibility, then you two wouldn’t work. One would get resentful of the other and that’s not a recipe for a healthy relationship. He’s telling you now so that you both have a chance of finding someone who is right for you instead of spending years with someone who isn’t. Sometimes love doesn’t solve everything.

Hey there, first off I’m sorry for the situation! I know it’s hard when things end up not working out how we thought! I can understand the frustration you’re feeling and i do agree with the comment you made about how this should have been something discussed earlier on not after saying i love you and etc. if it was that big of a deal breaker for him he should have made that clear from the beginning, so that expectations were set. However, i do think you’re dodging a bullet! You are so young and you definitely don’t have to know how you feel about this stuff yet but in the long run it’s better for this to have happened sooner rather than later! It sucks now but it’s better than you ending up in a relationship feeling pressured to make decisions you can’t reverse later on!

But he's older so his life goals are different. You might just not be compatible and it may be for the best to just leave it at that.
If you tell him that you might change your mind and you're together for some years but you still don't want kids he'll have to start over in his 30s. And if he loves you enough by then that he doesn't leave you, he'll resent you for the rest of your life.

At 19 you have many years ahead to get your bearings as in life goals. Career trajectory. Love life and all and sundry.

Just a personal opinion. Dont rush into anything overly serious too soon. I got married and had 2 kids by 27. Divorced at 28 and realised even at that age i wasnt where i wanted to be. Im 35 now and have have direction and goals. 2 more kids and a long term partner and still wondering which direction life will take me.

"It's good that this was brought out into the open before you got serious.

My older brother once asked for my advice a long time ago as he wanted children, but the women he dated didn't seem to be on the same page. I pointed out that he was nearly 30 and the women he dated were in their early 20's. I suggested he look at women that might be at the same point in life as him, and that younger women are unlikely to want to settle down right away as they might have careers they need to establish etc etc.

My daughter is not much older than you and has always declared herself childfree. When she got a serious boyfriend i suggested to her that if she hadn't already, she should make sure that boyf was also not wanting children (and make sure she was protected). She explained that now she had found someone, kids weren't entirely off the table, but not for a looong time, and i was reassured that she had had a mature discussion about it.  


My aunt married a man that didn't want children. They had an oops son. Husband said that was the last one. She went on to have twins. He left her before they were born and has never been in contact since. Shitty I know but an example of poor communication and terrible birth control.

You said yourself you are young - forget this man, he is not wrong for his opinion and you are not wrong for having yours, accept it and move on. You have many years of fun flings and casual relationships ahead of you before thinking about families and wether you want them or not - you may change your mind, you may not, but it's best to be clear about it with your potential partner."

And save money, as much as you can. Treatments are expensive; should you try that, you'll need the money, and if you don't, you'll have the money saved so you can do something great with it.

I didn't have children, not because I didn't want them/hate them, but because I chose not to do so because my bio-dad was someone I wouldn't want around my kids. He was entirely capable of doing something that would have made them wish they'd never been born; I gave them that gift. I don't regret it, but now I'm facing the question, ""Just what will I do with my estate?"" and it's not being as easy as I thought it might be (barring marrying someone with kids, I'll leave it to charity).

It's easy for them because most of them don't know what's waiting. They don't know before how painful it can be. I am young and I did my owm research about it and it's just scary. I think it's unserious to want to have kids at a specific time and to be willing to leave someone you love because of that. Having kids is overrated. If someone prefers to leave a woman they love to go have kids with another woman then in my opinion they have a problem. Having kids is not the only thing women are worthy for.

Most of them also do research and decide is worth it for them anyways. It sounds as if you think you are better or more educated than them. You’re not, we all do research.

I think you will find most people (both online and in real life) are going to have a hard disagree with you on that.

Whether to have children or not is a major life choice. Possibly *the* largest life choice. If someone is already certain in what direction they want to go (have/not have children), it makes no sense to spend time growing attached and start building a life with someone that is the opposite of you.

"People are being a little more harsh than they need to be (as right as they all are about life and whatnot). I understand the hurt. We were all 19 once too. It almost sounds like you want to convince him of how painful things would be for you and change his mind. I get that, I really do.

I also understand how he got your hopes up so much and then suddenly turned cold. It really would have been better for things to NOT progress so far before cutting things off so suddenly. I think he could have done a better job of communicating before leaving. Spending a little more time talking to you about why it's so important for him. But 25 really isn't that old. I know because I'm an idiot now and was a bigger idiot then. It makes a lot of sense why you'd feel abandoned.

Things will hurt for a while but the good news is your story isn't over. As you recover it'll be important to think about how to change things from your end in the future. For example, do you bring up the fact that you don't want kids within the first few days of meeting someone new? First few weeks? You'll have to decide on your own what makes sense for you before things go too far.

"On 14th of august 2023. 
On my 24th birthday, I have called him 24 times to  let him know that I know about him cheating on me. 
14 hours later he called. By then I have calmed down and took a nap while crying. I calmly asked him if he’s alone? He answered yes. I can hear that he was driving so I asked him can you pull aside? He said no my cousin is waiting for me and I’m already late. By that moment I have realised there was never a good time to have a talk with him, ever. I asked him again if he can pull aside because yes, I still worry about him and didn’t want to have a conversation like this while he’s driving, with his history of fast driving, drifting, and crashing. He kept insisting that I talk already. So, i calmly said I need to ask you something and I’ll give you the chance to answer truthfully. So I asked him about her, at first he simply denied, he kept saying he doesn’t know her, I said are you sure? Because I can prove otherwise. He said prove it, when I did his voice began to raise, I can hear the anger in his voice but I couldn’t understand why was he angry? I was the one who found out the truth about a three year’s relationship on my birthday. So I asked him, could you please lower your voice and talk to me like a grown up. His voice got even louder and he said please don’t ruin this night for me I’m going out to my cousins to have fun and play cards. I said I’m the one whose birthday is ruined. So I said one more chance, are you going to tell me the truth or not? He then replied with, and I quote “ I don’t care how many chances you give, I told you the truth”. So I said, well. I’m not boneheaded. Can you swear on anyone’s life? I gave him the chance to even choice his enemies life, he said I don’t have to swear. I didn’t lie and don’t call me a liar. Now I have to go I reached my distance, I asked him to wait outside for a bit so we can talk because I have every right to get an honest answer from you. He said he can’t (he can). I said are you sure you want to hang up? He replied “yes”. So I simply said okay and hung up."

"My birthday is this weekend. Months ago I told my husband I did not want a party. It’s my 40th. For my 30th my family threw me a surprise party and while I appreciated it, exerting that much energy into being socialable (especially with zero notice) was and is hard for me. I love the memories from that party and love the effort my family put into it but once is enough. I especially don’t want to spend the whole week leading up to an event cleaning my house for company. Then cleaning up after they leave. That is not a birthday present. That’s just more work. I don’t want to do any of it. So I said no party. My husband took this to mean do NOTHING. 

How do I know he’s planned nothing you may ask? Well let me tell you. 

Last night my husband hands me his phone Bc he wants me to deal with my mom via text. I read the texts he’s wanting me to respond to and My mom was asking him what the plan for my birthday was. I read something along the lines of him saying we are staying home and he’ll cook me dinner. That’s it. My mom was like ummmmmm that’s a bad idea. My husband wanted to eat his dinner and not deal with her so he gave me the phone to tell her I didn’t want a party. 

He wasn’t even planning on taking me to out dinner. He was just going to cook a meal at home. My husband cooks dinner every single night for himself and I can eat what he cooks anytime I want to. I rarely do and just eat Girl Dinner. He cannot clean up right so I always end up rewashing everything and spending a good chunk of time making our kitchen not a disaster. No one wants to eat off plates that still have old dried food on them. That’s what happens when he does the dishes. So I redo them whether I ate part of the meal or not. I don’t want to spend an hour cleaning the kitchen on my birthday.

I don’t know. I just kind of thought he’d at least take me to out to dinner. 

But Nope. He sure wasn’t going to. Until he realized I was upset. 

I got frustrated after reading his text messages and I told him I did not want to stay home and do nothing. Then I just got really sad about the whole thing.

For his birthday I planned and saved money for four months and took him out of town. I handled all the travel, the food, the entertainment. We did things he liked that were completely geared towards his taste. I asked his friends for insight to make sure I got the exact right gifts (husband collects bourbon and I wanted to make sure what I was spending money on would really excite him and add to his collection). He had a great time. I didn’t do all that effort to get something out of it on my birthday. I did it because I love him and wanted to celebrate his birthday in a fancier way than usual. I just wanted him to feel loved and appreciated more than anything. 

So here I am 24 hours later. He’s apologized for dropping the ball and says he’s now planning something, but it feels like he’s only planning something because I got upset, not because he cares. He mentioned Waffle House and mini golf and so help me God if that’s what we do I’m going to lose my shit. We do that with our kids all the time. I do not love it! But it makes my kids happy so we do it. 

Am I wrong for expecting more? Is this my fault for saying I didn’t want a party? I didn’t realize saying that would mean no celebrating AT ALL. I’m just so sad right now over the whole thing. 

I’m going to buy myself a cake tomorrow and maybe get my nails done. I’m just really sad right now.

Edit: because people seem to think we only had one conversation about this and it was just me saying “no party” which equals no plans. I have expressed several times what I would like to do for fun in several other situations. Idk why I have to specifically say I would like that same consideration for my birthday. He knows I love and value date night. He knows I love going out to eat. He knows I love leaving the kids with the grandparents for a few hours to catch a movie. I have told him in explicit detail what makes for a fun night for me. FOR YEARS I have communicated this."

"Lady, you've gotta learn how to communicate. You're giving me mixed signals just reading this and I'm not even your partner. You are extremely confusing and hot/cold on what you want. You complain about having to prep for plans, but then want to have plans. You don't want a party, but you want to go out to dinner with him alone I'm guessing? Not your family?

The point is, I don't get what you want and he doesn't either. Communicate. My birthday is next weekend and I told my husband I wanted to go out for afternoon tea and go to a vendor market. We're having a BBQ the next day with some friends. I'm making my own desserts. Boom. Done."	ACuriousTwinkie	reply	na	na	na	0.9993451237678528	weak	no	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.
"So...just out of curiosity - did you TELL him any of this prior to your being depressed and upset? Honestly, some men are really in the dark. They never hear you say anything or complain = she is ok with/loves it. Some men need to be guided, literally by the hand. If you told him you don't want a party, after all the trouble last time, couldn't you say 'hey, I would love a surprise party at a restaurant'. Thereby you don't have to clean a week before and after. Or - how about telling him 'hey, remember what I did for you on your birthday where I took you out of town and got you that super expensive whiskey? Maybe you could could put some thought into that for me?'
Since at this point.. seems you both don't communicate, nor know each other well. I say this not to put you/him down, just hear me out, since I am SOLELY going off what you have posted.
He doesn't know what YOU like, as a person, a woman, his wife. Just what you show him you like. Which is apparently only what you guys do with the kids, and/or together. So...why wouldn't he suggest the only things he knows you to like for your birthday? Which is mini golf and Waffle House? 
Then - and yes, I'll say it - I, as many women would LOVE to have our man cook for us. And that was the usual give and take by the way. Whoever cooks, the other does the dishes. No hours of cleanup, you do it side by side. Also, gives you a chance to talk. About your day, random things, etc. But, I'm much older than you, and I have a rather old school take on relationships. 
That said, you hate what he cooks. Have you said anything?
I notice you haven't complained about anything else, which leads me to hope he is a good husband and father? Just not considerate of your feelings and needs. I think if you go buy yourself a birthday cake, get your nails done, come home, light your candles and sing happy birthday to yourself, he is going to feel awful. As I said, some men just need to be held by the hand and have things spelled out for them. And after being  together this long, you know that just isn't him. If you want change, you need to communicate in a healthy way. Seek couples counseling. But if you're at the point where you are already, maybe (?) you're just falling out of love and need reasons to justify leaving him.

Again, I am not judging nor saying anything against either of you. Just speaking from experience.

If he wasnt sure what to do for your birthday when you said you didn't want a party, his response should have been to ask what you would like to do, and plan it.

Not to mention the ordeal with the dishes, whar is he, 12? He dropped everything when you said you didn't want a party because a party would be the easiest thing for him, your family would help plan and you would clean, he does nothing. So he did nothing again. You're absolutely in the right to be frustrated at his plans for Waffle house and mini golf as well. I really don't understand the comments. The bar is so fucking low. She wants to be taken out, doing things SHE loves, eathing things SHE loves, get a gift SHE loves and not doing things her husband or kids love or having to do chores. How fucking complicated is this? A husband of 1 year should know this, not someone you have a family with. And after everything you've done for him you basically given him instructions for what you would want as well.

"Honestly, I do agree with you as a man.. but I’m going to be honest, don’t you think a little bit more communication probably would’ve helped in this situation?

You put a disproportionate amount of time and effort into his gift, so there’s not a chance that you do not expect something less than an above average evening that he planned. I think you showed him your love language on his birthday, and now you’re upset that he didn’t plan anything after you indicating you did not want a party.

I do think he dropped the ball, but more communication would’ve gone a long way. Heck, My Wife and I give each other a heads up at least a week before our birthdays. “ Hey honey, what do you think about just going out to dinner together?” “ hey honey, do you want to go to the movies and then catch dinner?” Sure.. most of that does not require someone spending considerable time planning something, but I know My Wife and I will never let each other down when it comes to what we want on our birthdays.. mostly because we communicate."

Traveling gives me anxiety and I get very scared to leave our kids (one with ODD and ADHD as I know what he can do to his caregivers) so the whole trip was hard for me and built solely around him.

"I come from a lower middle class family. My mom is a seamstress for a manufacturing company and my dad is a delivery man for a food distribution company (delivers meat, ingredients, containers, etc. to restaurants). Together, they brought up my two siblings and I. I wish my parents could retire right now, but we are still in our late teens, early twenties, and not graduated yet.

Just like bring your kid to work, we experienced hands down a day at work as a delivery man. My dad had so many boxes to lift and move, jumping up and down of the truck, and had to make multiple trips with his little hand trolley for one customer. By the time he’s done with a customer, 3/4 of his shirt is soaked in sweat and he’s slightly panting and tired. My sister and I did our best to help him lift and move boxes, piling them up for him for easier transportation, but it still pains me so much to see my dad work so hard. I wish he could have a less physical demanding job, but he’s been doing it for years and doesn’t have the language skills to get another job. I cry thinking about how he has to do all that physical work whether it’s super hot outside, pouring or snowing. On top of that, he eats lunch alone in his truck almost every day and he often comes home smelling like sweat. It just makes me so sad because he’s the kindest and hardest working person.

No need to feel sad for your dad although it is very understandable as to why you do. Your dad has a wife, and a couple kids to come home to every single day after work and I know that means everything to him. Instead of feeling bad about what he goes through maybe treat him to a lunch on the weekend so he can have a lunch with someone for once. Get him a couple new shirts he can wear and use for work so he doesn’t have to wear the same previously sweated in clothes everyday. If you know it’s hot maybe look for a lunch pale that keeps things cold all day and surprise him with it so he can have a cold lunch on a hot day. Whatever you choose to do, appreciate that man for everything he does, not everyone is blessed with a hardworking and loving father, cherish it.	queen_smol	reply	na	na	na	0.0047171153128147125	weak	no	no	na	offmychest	failed

I think it would be helpful to both of you to share how you feel, just don’t forget that you’re the child and he’s the parent, and if not mostly ready, switching up the roles can cause a bigger strain in the family. I say this coz I have a cousin who feels similarly about his single mom and has sort of taken in the role of stand-in dad to his siblings. He’s kind of turned into a tyrant despite having the best intentions and has kinda pushed away his siblings.
I kind of feel bad to suggest talking coz it’s like a very tiny bandaid. But try to not pity him. Be proud of him, he’s doing an awesome job at his work even though I def wish it was much more comfortable and took a lighter toll on his body.

He also obviously raised two fantastic children who love him enough to spend a day at work with him. I bet that was his best day in a while.

"So I made a post a few weeks ago about staying with my wife’s family in France and their openness about walking around the house nude. I figured I’d give an update on what has happened since then. 

My wife’s sister came across the post as it was reshared on TikTok and felt the coincidences were a bit too on the nose. She spoke to my wife about it and my wife came to me asking if this post was made by me. While I denied it straight away, long story short, she went into the Reddit app and saw that the username were there and I couldn’t deny it any further. 

Rightfully so, she was disgusted and very upset. SIL and MIL were refusing to speak to me and asked me to leave as soon as possible. They didn’t feel comfortable with me in the house. I changed my flight and flew back to the US last week and my wife is still in France. The normal plan was for us to come back in a couple weeks, but now I’m not sure when or if she will come back. I’m not quite sure what to say or do now, but I strongly believe that there is no coming back from this. 

Go ahead and laugh at me now, but it’s been a rough couple weeks.

Edit: I woke up this morning to well over 100 comments and quite a few messages, so while I can’t respond to everyone, I just wanted to say thanks for those who understand my situation, but I fully understand those who think I’m getting what I deserve. 

 I wrote the other post in like ten minutes one night and figured a couple people would laugh and then move on from it all. The whole reason why I wrote it was cause I really was struggling and just wanted to vent anonymously and let those intrusive thoughts stay in my head. I certainly didn’t expect it to blow up and most definitely didn’t expect it to be shared on TikTok. 

There’s obviously a lot more that happened than what I wrote here, but I just wanted to keep things brief. No clue where to go from here, but my wife and I have been in constant contact through text and FaceTime and it’s been more of just the same argument over and over. She’s planning to come back in a couple weeks, so hopefully we can have a proper discussion at that point."

"To a certain extent, I think a lot of the comments here show a major problem in society. 

I think recognizing that being around certain naked people aroused you, but not acting or thinking about acting is a pretty normal thing. Personally, I think too many people are jumping on their high horse, instead of being realistic. 

Sexuality is a major part of human existence. I think we as a society ignore much of this which leads to a lot of the issues we see with sex and society."	StinkySquirrelSauce	reply	na	na	na	0.9979639053344727	no	strong	no	na	offmychest	failed
"Kinda put off by the comments in this thread chastising OP for “sexualising” his wife’s family tbh, as if that’s something he’s gone out of his way to do. If your cultural context is that nudity=sexual, then you can’t just switch that off on demand. It’s an association that’s woven pretty deeply into your brain if that’s how you’ve been conditioned to think.

And like, OPs family knew he was uncomfortable with it and teased him about it, but are now shocked to learn that the guy who has grown up associating nudity with arousal is aroused by their nudity? 

I just kinda feel like the ignorance of cultural differences cuts both ways in this story. 

That being said posting about it was dumb lol. People should know by now that there’s a ton of TikTok accounts that trawl these subs for content.

"One thing I find intriguing, is that they were showing you what you see are their privates, and they expected you to be ok with it, but when they saw your private thoughts, they didn't take to lightly either.

I don't see those things crossing your mind as wrong, is hard to control those things, specially with your upbringing. 
In a neutral way of viewing this I wouldn't have seen any wrong what was crossing your mind and the way you were having a hard time dealing with it. There is a good chance that if you talked to them about it that it wouldn't have been good either, so it was understandable your hesitation to talk to your wife or them. 
The biggest problem I see here was you straight up lying to them.
There is still a chance they can understand, because the whole point of you anonymously posting here was to not let anyone know what was coming across your mind.
I really doubt people go out telling everyone ever little thing that comes across their mind. 

If your feelings are sincere from what you post onto your original message, I say: just amplify the fact you were sharing things that were crossing your mind, and for good reasons, you couldn't just straight up bring this up to them, as you saw nothing good could come up from that.
You tried to speak all out in an attempt to flee from such thoughts, as you believe saying to someone could do.
You tried to make this conversation private, with people who shouldn't have know you, or your family, but due to chance this is not how things went.
Now the lie could be tie to the whole point of you just setting your thoughts free without involving them, however even though you tried that, by the time she asked you, was too late, so your lie still should never happen, although considering your position, and that if you had time to be less overwhelmed you likely come clear about it, could have a possibility for the lie to be forgiven.
From your end, I think you need to put yourself together and naturally apologize to them for inadvertently having this whole issue blow into them.
But you gotta do on your own words, mine was just one possible scenario I could see being what happened.

Now you don't need to share this, as you already share enough to make you lots of trouble, but one question that is also very important is:
Did they ever discuss with you that they live like that and that when you got there you be ok with such happening for as long as you were there?

From your story it seems very unlikely, and more like you got surprised by this whole arrangement and had to deal on your own about the whole issue.
If such is true, it adds to your case, and I say, even an apology from their side would also be something they could do, since if you were aware of it, this whole thing could have been prevented.
However if they made you aware of it before. Then their reaction are completely understandable, and your chance in any of this are slim to none."	StinkySquirrelSauce	reply	na	na	na	0.9979639053344727	no	no	no	na	offmychest	failed
"Hmmm.

While posting what you thought to the world was not the right move here, and you most definitely should've had a sit down with your new family.

The comments here kinda surprised me.

Some people are uncomfortable around other naked people, it doesn't always mean they are sexualizing anyone.

I personally am extremely uncomfortable being around anyone naked other than my partner. I'm naked all the time at home alone or with my partner but never in front of anyone else. Not only because I wouldn't be comfortable but I wouldn't want to make anyone else uncomfortable.

It's not exactly the norm even in other countries to just be naked around any ole person.

Especially depending on what they are doing while naked, it could be very unsanitary in certain situations.

I also have a lot of childhood trauma from SA so this plays hugely into my uncomfortableness around other's naked bodies.

"I was a sociology student in college, and the biggest thing i learned is that we view things as taboo that other cultures don't. Since we don't understand it, we tend to make harsh judgments or feel very awkward at times. What was never stated, though, was how the roles can easily be reversed. You felt awkward because you view nudity as overtly sexual and you went to make light of your situation to strangers for some peace of mind. However, once your wife and extended family found out, they saw that you were aroused in the situation and therefore are potentially a creep because they have a much more laid-back view of nudity culturally. This is just a cultural misunderstanding, and I hope you and your wife/family get sit down, discuss this, and come back together. 

Also, idk about the rest of the world, but I know I probably can't tell my wife that her and her sister and mom are the same level of sex appeal. That was a fumble. Never tell the anonymous internet anything like that. It isn't that anonymous, apparently.

I might get down voted but I dont think you didn't do anything wrong, hell in your OP they said they teased you about the situation because they know you view nudity differently from them, so either they knew you were uncomfortable or uncomfortable aroused by the situation, both cases you cant just magically change how you see things, maybe in time, because I live in a family where what your in laws do is normal but alot of ppl also are not used to it, so usually I'd wear clothes in front of guests. I'm not sure what you could have done in this situation?

"I just read the original post, and honestly it was very tame. I can understand that they felt uncomfortable after discovering your post, being that this is their way of life and is not normally sexualised, HOWEVER they also teased you about it, meaning they obviously know that your upbringing sexualises nude people. Being that their dad is not in the picture anymore, having a man in the house that you know is constantly sexualising you could be quite uncomfortable, to say the least. However, your wife should not be blowing up about this at all (if she is). It’s a simple situation of different upbringings leading to different ideas, and just like you said in the original post, having to look at 3 versions of your wife walking around nude is incredibly difficult to manage. I think this situation can be very easily salvaged, however both yourself and your wife need to sit down and genuinely analyse/assess the situation and put aside your differences. No one did anything inherently wrong in this situation, nor were you a perv. Hopefully her family in France can also come to an understanding of the situation, and be forgiving. Maybe even be a little bit more reasonable with how they dress when you’re around, if they allow you to come back.

"They knew you were having difficulties handling the situation. Maybe you didn't outright state it to them, but they were giving you a hard time about it (no pun intended), so they knew. Due to being uncomfortable with how it all made you feel you came to Reddit to 'silently' have your thoughts heard. You even alluded to how a little alone time with your wife might have been able to fix this whole issue you were having. 

It was a cultural difference that caused a misunderstanding and I honestly don't think it's wrong to think your wife comes from an attractive family. Maybe in the immediate aftermath it's hard to consider it as a compliment, but the bottom line is you think they're good, attractive people. Part of what sexually attracts you to your wife seems to run in the family. No big woop, probably not a surprise to them, and hopefully you can all move forward positively."

I think what they perhaps don’t understand is why it was so public, like from their angle it may look like you just told the whole world their business. But you didn’t, and I imagine you felt Reddit would be a bit more private or anonymous. 

How would a text post be shared on TikTok though? Not sure I get that.

"I didn’t read the original post so I’m not understanding the full context of what was happening but my take from what I have read is that he grew up in a area where nudity was considered to be a sexual preference like seeing a movie where a person was nude and they were turned on sexually by seeing the woman’s breast or the man’s nude body and the way the man was portrayed the person felt a sexual desire towards the man.

 But going to his family’s home for a few weeks he was uncomfortable with his mother in law and sister in laws lack of clothing and seeing the women in various stages of undress he admired their beauty in their natural bodies but it also made him think of a sexual aspect that left him feeling uncomfortable and guilty as he felt that his thoughts being sexual were not right and he had no one to talk to so he comes to post something that he thought would be anonymous but was anything but and he was panicking and lied about making the post because he was 1. Embarrassed 2. Afraid of making the situation worse 3. Caught between a rock and a hard place 4. Got caught at his lie and his wife and her mother and sister were upset and asked him to leave.

 Am I missing something here because I can’t find the post to understand exactly everything that happened except that he is back in the US and his wife is in France and he thinks that his marriage cannot survive because of his actions.

 If I have everything correct my thoughts are. … Oh Boy….

 So when I was in my early 40’s I had a very very good looking doctor. He was very handsome and he was a lot younger than I was and I was married!!! I had to have surgery and apparently I talked under anesthesia and I apparently couldn’t shut up telling him everything I wanted to do…
 A couple of nurses teased me relentlessly about my crush on the doctor which I had no clue to what they were talking about and finally one of the nurses told me!!! I was so embarrassed and I changed doctors immediately afterwards as soon as possible and even moved to start seeing a doctor 2 towns away!!!

 I can’t say that I didn’t have a sexual desire because obviously I did but if confronted I would have probably lied especially if it was my husband confronting me !!!😳😳😳😳

 I would probably have sexual thoughts if I had a roommate that walked around naked in the mornings.

 Doesn’t mean that I would act on it but I would probably have thoughts!

 Is that what is going on with OP?

  I can admire a person’s body but I can’t control my thoughts even if I feel guilty for having them because I think it’s something that happens! Doesn’t mean that I am guilty for having them and acting like OMG I am disgusting 🤢.

  Did he know that his in-laws lived in a culture where nudity was going to be happening every single day?

 Did his wife tell him what to expect or tell her family that he had been raised differently and he might be uncomfortable?

 Did he apologize?

 Did he ask that they put on a robe?

 Did he leave the room when they walked in nude?

 I have a lot of questions but I can’t jump to a YTA either because I don’t have all the facts.

 I think if I was raised from a infant to be nude and see everyone in my family nude as a normal family dynamic then it would be absolutely normal but if I was raised to cover myself which I was and taught that nudity equals sexual attraction and desire then that’s normal for my family dynamic .

  The one thing that I read about and have a big question is that they asked him to leave because they didn’t feel safe with him being in their house.

 I have to wonder if they had ever gone to a nude beach or event and if they never had another person there to have a sexual thought ever cross their minds just because nudity was so acceptable and it’s perfectly fine but just because it was a family member that they were left feeling unsafe!

 I hope they all can talk about this and both sides can offer genuine apologies and try to understand each culture and his wife will work with him but I don’t know what else he can do.

 I’m not saying that he needs to be ostracized for having his own thoughts.

 I’m not saying that his family needs to change their culture or anything else but I do think that if his wife didn’t tell him or tell her family about him being uncomfortable then that is a entirely other matter."	StinkySquirrelSauce	reply	na	na	na	0.9979639053344727	no	no	no	na	offmychest	failed
"OP I'm sorry you're going through this. You're not at fault here. It might've not been the wised to post this story on Reddit or lie about that but besides that you're not at fault here. 

You're not used to the ""free"" nature of your in-laws. You're not to blame for that. Also she probably couldn't have warned you because in her eyes this was viewed as normal. In regards to having sexual feelings seeing your in-laws, it's not strange. As you've said, they're basically other versions of your wife in regards to how similar they look. You're attracted to your wife and your subconscious brain sees the similarities. Since you're not crossing any boundaries and contain yourself, you're also not bad in this case.

It's good that you went back to America. Please have an open conversation with your wife and apologize for putting this story on the internet. Explain how you are raised and what is normal in regards to exposure from your culture. Tell her that everywhere you went you were reminded of her and that your intimacy together which has come to an halt due to staying there has only made things worse.

"I mean.... you sexualized them every time you saw them by your description in your last post. Appreciation is one thing, but I guess you were not able to conceal your identity best enough on reddit.

Sucks that you wanted a space to share confidentially and the reality is the internet does not hide anything. I kind of wonder why it didn't phase you that you had lots of traction? Usually, when something blows up, it goes to other places other than reddit. I would've took it down thinking of the consequences. But I guess, if you really believed you wouldn't be found out, you wouldn't think to take it down.

Nudity, imo is just bodies. We are all just bodies. The way I saw it from your last post is the secret sexualizing and getting turned on part that they might be put off by. The lying as well. Also, the posting about their lives in a way where it seems abnormal or for the entertainment of the internet.

"I don't get why people are surprised that this guy felt horny by seeing attractive naked women. 

To a male, it doesn't matter who the person is, except a blood sister or mother, whom to most men are naturally not ever entertained in the mind as ""fair game"" so never even considered in a sexual way. 

But most men naturally subconsciously assess any other technically ""available"" women for sexual purposes. Its not necessarily intentional, its just how males are wired. Be it sister in law, colleague, wife's friend, friends wife, kids teacher, walmart cashier,  whoever... and even more especially if it seems like the women are highly sexual, I.e. wandering around naked.

Those ideas don’t make us bad men or sick perverts. They come with the package (yeah yeah). It’s about how we process it. Processing it is exactly what OP was attempting to do. 

Perhaps it would have been smarter for him to do in a men’s group, or somewhere else, but he certainly didn’t intend or expect it to blow up.

He doesn’t necessarily sound uncomfortable with it, and if his main issue was him being uncomfortable with their choice of (or lack of) clothing then that wasn’t construed correctly in the first post.

"Well I can only say GOOD LUCK. But according to what I read in your two POSTs.

For what they angry is because they feel sexualized and that it came from a man they have confidence. But what they expect from a man with a different mentality than them and who has stimulus like that, coupled with the lack of intimacy with your wife. 

The mistake you made was not having confidence in your wife and talking to her about this issue and instead of talking to her you made a post that went viral and embarrassed them. 

You are already an adult and you should know that you must first communicate your problems to your wife and talk about them, never think for her.

What I would do in this case is: 

1. Make a Facetime call with your wife. 

2. Apologize for what you did and explain yourself better without blaming, you are to blame for not speaking sooner. 

3. Ask to speak to your MIL and SIL and sincerely apologize to them and tell them that you didn't mean to see them that way but that you weren't used to it and the lack of intimacy with your wife didn't help.

4. See their reactions as well as your wife's and ask her clearly what you can do to make her forgive you. Tell her that you are afraid of losing her (of course if that is what you really feel, if not, no)

 If you see that there is hope to save things and if you have the money travel back to France and to her in surprise her, so that she sees that you love her and want to be with her no matter what.

Talk to your wife honestly and try to work things out without fighting. 

Do not wait for her to come back, because the only thing you will achieve is that the resentment grows bigger. Make the effort to get her back, that she sees and feels loved and that she really cares about you.

If affter the facetime call you see that there is no case, based on her reaction, do not go there and wait for her to return and try to save what you can.

"Depends. And I said, in a fair way, they could.

If I set up for us to go somewhere to spend a very long time at, as a family gathering, and I don't disclose, nor I think such thing should be necessary, and dismiss that between both of our upbringing with have two different cultures, and expect you to just know the generalized idea in this case is true towards them, and feel superior to your own culture, like your feelings don't matter, or whatever shows up in your mind is your fault and your problem to solve: or anything close to those lines.
Then yeah, in a fair way, and a world in which we all emphasize, (after the fact), an apology is not out of the realms, or anything I view ridiculous to suggest.
Not saying the apology should be something after anyone feel guilty about, just that shows you are aware some of your actions (or lack of) is tight to the events that unfold, and for that you are sorry.
If you just dismiss those, he may be wrong, and people may take the other side, but that would just show how hypocrite people can be, in the bases of charge someone for their actions, but feel superiority and their actions shouldn't be included on the same level field to be judged.

I'm just trying to be fair considering all I read, even though I didn't necessarily took too much thinking, like I was actually judging anyone. Just written what came to mind, since is not like I'm being pressured to actually judge, or feel the need that I must do.

I tried to convey this in my message, when I suggested him not to take what I say, but actually come out with his on feelings and explanations according to the actual facts that he knows.

My end paragraph also felt incomplete after I wrote, although it is so since I had written so much already.
But even if the end paragraph was what happened, is likely means that something bigger could be behind this whole thing, and that he just went along with all this even though he clearly couldn't handle; so basically he was allowing to be a pushover.

There is many other possibilities here.

I like, and hope, there is no illment or bad intent in either side, and that each side can sees the other and that they work things out, why I written things putting emphasis on the best outcome.

The best outcome would be for him to come out with a sincere apology, and that the other side can see that they also have some fault and complement that apology.
But like I said, that would depend on the remaining of the story that was not told to be like they basically threw him at their way of life with him having no clue what he was getting into, or his clue only being speculative, and not considering happening to him until was too late.
I think the best scenario is a good chance, and I hope is what happened, since I rather see good outcomes than things getting torched to crisp."	StinkySquirrelSauce	reply	na	na	na	0.9979639053344727	no	strong	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.

I suffer from alot of social anxiety, and i can assure uou that the best way to ease tension off a topic or a situation is to man up and acknowledge that you are very uncomfortable to yourself and others. And have a calm, grounded, adult conversation about it. 

It is ok to be uncomfortable or nervous. I mean c'ome on, the inlaws and his wife must have some kind of understanding that this is a whole differant world for OP. It will take time for OP to adjust. 
But how are they supposed to be considered towards him, if he is lying and being in denial towards them? 

I'm sorry but you cannot be anonymous in the real life about something like your inlaws nudity lifestyle, while spending  a very exstensive vacation in their home... that is just not how life nor adulting works.

This is what people don’t seem to get. Families are FAMILY. When you marry into a family you become a son and brother, which does come with a certain level of trust.

"From what I remember of the og post, his wife is french he's not and they went to visit her family in France and she mentioned some of her family are somewhat nudist but with how casual she said it he thought maybe they just occasionally visit nude beaches or something not realizing in France it was common for them to walk around or lounge around nude in the house for good portions of the day. He coming from an entirely different upbringing felt like he was both uncomfortable and a pervert because not being used to this change in social norms kept getting turned on when he didn't want too and didn't know if he should tell them he wasn't comfortable with it or if they would dislike him if he brought it up or if he should just keep trying to be casual and not say anything because it seemed normal for them and he didn't want to disturb their own customs and ways of living too much.

So he probably should have at least told his wife this was a huge shift in norms for him, but it is understandable that he didn't want to to make a bad impression on meeting her close family in her home country and seem like he was judging their societal traditions and norms over there, it just that unfortunately he kept having biological reactions to it as this isn't something he's used to, same way people who grew up in complete nudist towns don't get reactions like that because it's just every day life for them and nothing special or different."

I usually take things seriously. Even when I know something is a joke. I'm the odd ball who enjoys commenting about the jokes like it was for real.

"Let's talk about reality TV shows. You know, those programs where we watch people do absolutely ordinary things but with dramatic music and questionable editing choices. Here's why I think they're a colossal waste of time:
  

  
You spend more time watching other people's lives than living your own. Seriously, who needs real friends and real experiences when you can witness fake friendships and scripted drama from the comfort of your couch?
  

  
The level of suspense is off the charts... NOT! Will they survive a week without their cell phones? Will they manage to cook a meal without setting the kitchen on fire? The tension is unbearable! 
  

  
And don't get me started on the ""reality"" aspect. Let's be honest, those shows are about as real as unicorns riding on rainbows. Ever noticed how the most dramatic moments happen when the cameras are conveniently rolling?
  

  
Contestants on these shows have mastered the art of crying on demand. Seriously, I'm convinced they have hidden tear factories tucked away somewhere. Is there an Oscar for Best Performance in a Reality Show? Because they deserve it!
  

  
Oh, and the elimination process! It's like a never-ending series of popularity contests. It's high school all over again, but with grown-ups desperately vying for camera time and a chance to win a mediocre prize.
  

  
My parents are hooked on to these ""reality"" TV shows, and sometimes I end up in unavoidable circumstances and I have to watch it with them. I usually just sit with my phone to escape the torture and that's when I came across this video about Sadhguru conversing with Mike Tyson and he says that the need for entertainment and pleasure comes due to a lack of joy in our lives, that immediately struck a chord and resonated deeply within me and it's something we need to look at ourselves - why are we mindlessly consuming so much of entertainment? It's not like we're going to die if we don't consume entertainment.
  
So there you have it, Reality TV shows: the ultimate time suck that provides a unhealthy dose of manufactured drama and questionable entertainment value. Maybe it's time we switch off the TV and create some real-life adventures of our own!

I agree. I think it has made our society shallow. Many view it is an outlet to escape from their real lives and its problems.

I’m 32 and have been working at the same company since 18, a family business started by my father. In the last year and a half I have went through a miscarriage (I am a male, my spouse obviously had it), a subsequent divorce and about 6 months of depression. All while being the top worker in said company, the stress of multiple big jobs on top of my personal life falling apart left me questioning everything. It’s been over a year since all the unfortunate events started but when I woke up this morning I just knew I couldn’t keep pretending I was okay with this life. I walked in this morning and told my father, after this next big job is done I have to go do my own thing. He was shocked and asked what I planned on doing, I told him the truth which is I have no idea.

"So I had a boyfriend like that a long time ago.  He was obsessed with this computer game.  Had set up an empire, guild and he was pretty popular.  He didn't shower and it started getting gross and boring.  After two weeks of this grossness...  I said fuck that.  I got ready looking hot and as sexy as I could possibly get to looking and grabbed my purse and keys and was walking out and I said have fun I'll see you later.  he said where am I going.  I told him to the bookstore to get coffee and just hang out and read.

Then he sat there for a good while and he said.. ok I'll get in the shower and come with you 

He knew what I meant by saying that.  Sometimes you have to remind them that they need to get their ass up and take a breather.  

Just, I knew what stirred him up enough.  Every guy is different.  When you leave just say I'll see you later.  Lol.

Some men only respond to action and when they are obsessed with gaming they get used to women getting in their face.  Think about how moms nag their kids.  So to me they're in a sort of trance.  This helps them wake-up.

I was never going out with the intention of hooking up.  Just looking good and walking out he knows other men would try and pursue me if I'm by myself in a place where singles go to meet up.

"My guess is he's either depressed and needs professional help or he has a terrible gaming addiction and needs professional help. Hard part is making him realize it. What helped me when I was like this about a year ago was my gf really expressing how my neglect for both her and myself made her feel. How she was worried about me and was exhausted by having to take care of everything at home since I was just playing games all day. And it was a hard as fucc pill to swallow at first but I could tell how badly it affected her and our relationship and that made me realize I had no other option but to seek professional help.

So maybe try something like that? Not just telling him he plays too much and you want him to play less, but express how it makes you feel. Cause I can guess you don't feel very important in the relationship right now. He needs to know that. And if he does care he'll have to change. If you can't get him to change or seek help I honestly only see one option. An ultimatum.

"*Note- if u do not want to work things out

If u live in the US and do not have a prenup, or your state does not have laws that will automatically protect you. DO NOT lawyer up unless there is a significant amount of money involved.  

You can consult an atty for advice, but DO NOT let him talk u into filing a complaint.  It will be more expensive for you as the Plaintiff (in most cases). Plus, if u get an attorney, he’ll feel obligated to get one. 

Your attorneys will waive your right to arbitration/mediation (this is NJ, many, but not all states the same. But u can find everything on Google). 

If you proceed w/out attorneys, you can just look up the laws, and outsmart him. Without an attorney pushing to argue EVERYTHING b/c they bill hrly (I know this b/c I used to work at a family law firm).  

That said, if u have live in a community property state, my advice would change.  But this already getting too long"	Direct-Chair6351	reply	na	na	na	0.9988982677459717	weak	no	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.
"Start by allowing yourself to feel and cry about this. You just found that scumbag wasted your time, love, and energy. 

Second, recognize what he did and what he is, he’s a cheater and a user. He used you and your emotions. If he comeback to you, giving you excuses say “you never gave me attention, or you don’t look the same.” THAT IS HIM GASLIGHTING YOU TO THINKING ITS YOUR FAULT!! DO NOT FALL FOR IT. HIS ACTION IS HIS ACTIONS. A CHEATER IS GONNA CHEAT. (If he does comeback like that, get rid of him. Get him out your life. The stress will kill you, I’m not joking either) 

After that, focus on self love, you make see yourself crying again in the future and that’s ok. You were in love with this man. 

But you have to remember: If you let him back in your life, he hurt you once, he can do it again. 

At this stage, get a book, write all the stuff he did that pissed you off, and start setting boundaries. So the next relationship (if you chose to) your in, you have boundaries and if anyone crosses them, you know when to walk away. (Same for friends too) 

Also, LEARN TO BE BY YOURSELF FIRST. Learn what peace by yourself is like so when the right guy/girl comes up, you have to ask yourself, “Does the mf add to my peace, or take away from it.”

Keep in mind you can find love no matter what age
Your at. There are over 8 billion people on the planet YOU WILL FIND SOMEONE IF YOU CHOOSE TO. 

PS if he says “you’ll never find a guy like me out there” tell him.

Someone tells you who they really are, believe them. He's proven that you can't trust him and that he's a dirty disrespectful liar. Absolutely do not let him back in. If you want to work through things then he needs to meet your conditions before you'll allow him back. I would imagine a severe amount of counseling with a therapist perhaps. A long discussion about just what the hell is going on. Honestly once the trust is broken in my opinion you might as well end it but it's your life at the end of the day and you've invested an absolute ton of time with this person so really it's what your heart is telling you. I would absolutely consult a lawyer before I do absolutely anything. And I would change the locks. Don't let him in your house you don't know what he's going to do. Desperate men with little to lose do desperate things. If he thinks that now that you know the relationship is going to end he may attempt to burn bridges in the worst ways possible and your livelihood shouldn't have to be what he burns.

He would do something that he knew would piss me off and then rather than having adult discussion about it he would just stop responding to texts and avoid me for a week.

I have nobody to share this with so I’ll just put it here. I have been sober from all substances for 3 days. This is the first time in a year and a half I’ve managed to go this long. The withdrawal is bad. I even had some shakes on the first day, now they’ve calmed down. My brain is going crazy at the moment. I feel absolutely horrible…. But man. Drinking and drugs will just make me feel worse and prolong the healing process. I finally get it now. I’ve reached out for support and now I’ve been attending addictions groups for the last month now. I’m so desperate to beat my addiction and flourish. I know there’s a winner inside of me, heck before all the substance use I was on track for a good life path. Good thing I’m only 23 and it’s not like I wasted all of my 20’s before I realized. I’m not saying I won’t mess up ever again and from now on I’ll be perfect. I’m just saying I’ve made the decision that this life isn’t for me. I’ve said I’m done with substances several times before but something feels different about this time. I’m weighing the costs and benefits of using and realizing it’s NOT worth it. In the past I tried quitting for my partner, for my job, for my parents… now I’m quitting for me because I WANT to.	creepysink77	post	24.30479943073251	female	White	0.003516895230859518	na	na	na	27	offmychest	failed

"I was working on my computer and heard a dog cry out in pain. I looked outside the window and saw how random people flocked around the dog to help it and care for it. One lady ran to a random restaurant and came back with a metal bowl filled with water, another lady immediately called the cops, who arrived within a few minutes, everyone seemed to care about the dog, and everyone wanted to tell the police officer what had happened. The dog was fine in the end, it could still walk and the owner left in his car, presumably to go and see a vet.

It's a fucked up thing to hit a dog in your car, to then drive off without stopping, definitely, but here's my experience with getting hit by a car, which prompted me to get something off my chest.

Two years ago, I was on my road bike. The driver had to stop and let me pass, since I was on a cycling lane, but she decided to brake directly on the lane, which is a big no-no. The driver gave me no reaction time to save myself, so I crashed into the side of the car, shoulder first, at 30 km/h and it sped off.

I remember lying on my back in pain, and saw people cycling past me, and walking on like nothing had happened. Some people just looked for a second, to then move on, but not a single, ""Are you okay?"" Four twenty-somethings started laughing at me because I swore really loudly at the driver of the car, and I had to tell them off while my shoulder was nearly lying out of the socket. That felt bizarre, to defend yourself while you were just the victim of a hit and run by a vehicle.

A single cyclist stopped and asked me how I was, if I needed an ambulance or help. I made it back home without any assistance, thankfully, but I found it so odd then that no one seemed to give a fuck about a person getting hit by a car.

I suppose that just seeing the dog, and how it received more care and attention than me, a 36 y/o human being, brought up some unresolved feelings and thoughts. The driver of the car fucked my shoulder up, and I couldn't cycle properly for 2 months, and it left me with a condition in which I couldn't lie on that shoulder without slowly losing the feeling in my arm. I went to my doctor to get an MRI scan, but they couldn't find anything broken, so they figured that it might've been something related to a nerve. Luckily it fixed itself after a year or so."	berserkerererer	post	24.48170891895317	male	White	0.6223965883255005	na	na	na	7	offmychest	failed

You're getting downvoted, and so am I, which is typical.

I think that the people who are doing the downvoting, are the people who would rather help a dog out than a human. I believe that it's a misanthropic trend that caught on a decade ago in the mainstream, but maybe even earlier.

The way I see it, helping a dog is a socially accepted quick-win to signal to the outside world that you are a good person. You could even care and tend to a dog's needs, despite it actually needing immediate care or help. The dog won't be able to tell you through words that it has a sore paw, or that it feels dizzy. All that matters is the outward perception of how you've helped an innocent being, a dog, and it makes you look good. The dog's opinion doesn't matter in the slightest, all that matters is that the person who has aided the dog, or the innocent being, is seen as good, hence a quick-win to feel good and look good.

But a human, well, you don't know whether the person you're helping out is actually good or bad, a racist or an anti-racist, a feminist or a misogynist, a rapist or a saint, toxic or a thief, a nazi or a feminazi, and therefore, it might just not be worth the effort to help a fellow human being out, especially in this day and age of smartphones, in which you could be seen helping out an undesirable, potentially by the entire world.

Edit -

And I'm not saying that the dog didn't deserve help. Of course it did. All I'm saying is that I found it rather odd that when I got hit by a car, no one cared, but when a dog got hit by a car, the entire neighborhood came to its rescue and the cops somehow showed up within minutes."	berserkerererer	follow-up	na	na	na	0.6223965883255005	weak	strong	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.

"(Sorry for the typo in the title.) I was with this person for half a decade. Happy it ended when it did (via TEXT he handled our breakup btw.) but the fact I never got the proposal in 5 years but this girl did in 7 ish months makes me feel I was place holder or a learning lesson for this guy.

From cheating on me, lying to me and manipulating the narrative whenever I was catching on to something, and outright being crass/rude often, I look back and get so angry at my self. Of course he kept treating me the way he did because I let it happen and he most like had no respect for me. Who would?

The last few years I gained a bit of weight (35 pounds throughout our relationship and I’m pretty short.) and sex was not as frequent, especially after doing long distance the last few years (he’s in the military.)

During my last visit two different sex workers reached out to his phone, yet he’d either laugh it off as spam or get mad/offended with me when he saw how paranoid and anxiety driven it made me. Then I found realistic silicone sex doll. Looking back it’s built like the wife he currently has, a tall woman with a gorgeous body who was visiting the states from a foreign country.

The month before we broke up I was absolutely done, I don’t want to get into details but I found out was I affected physically because he slept around or hooked up with someone (I’m ok now and it wasn’t anything too serious!). Felt like my body was violated, I was so immensely grossed out by him and my self. He still managed to not take accountability and even tried questioning me, telling me he’d forgive me and love me if I cheated on him. I was so depressed and tired. Yet, I was still waiting for the right time to breakup up since he was at his most suicidal at that point, but knew I had to do it soon. I didn’t love him anymore.

The only reason I found out he got married was because I saw her Instagram pop up with a wedding picture of the two. I almost threw up from the shock. Seems he blocked me and most of our mutual friends, his family also didn’t share anything.

I just feel humiliated. I should have left years earlier like I wanted to, not stay because he would make claims he was lonely, depressed and far too often kid around that he’d  kill himself if I left him or straight up call me crying about how suicidal he was. He also pushed his own friends away, so it’s contradictory how he felt lonely. 

Maybe he changes for this woman, it’s possible he needed his exact physical type to be a better partner. 

Right now I’m just focusing on trying to love my self again, get fit, and convince my self the person I’m currently seeing isn’t the same."	Ok_Oven_6714	post	25.171675550672475	male	White	0.9986757636070251	na	na	na	15	offmychest	failed

Right now, only thing you can do is focus on yourself, delete photos, greive the future that you imaged with him and the person whom you met in beginning. Try not to think too much about how he could do this, because you will never understand as you wouldn't do that to someone you love yourself.

"Unfortunately, this seems to be a common story. 

First, getting married to someone else within 7 months of a significant breakup is a huge red flag, and doesn’t bode well for the nature of their relationship. It sounds like that decision may have been made from lots of intense positive emotions (ie, honeymoon phase, or even something more sinister like lovebombing).

Second, regarding your last two statements—I doubt he will change for this woman. If his new wife puts up with his behavior, maybe they’ll last—otherwise, unless he’s willing to put in actual, meaningful work, they will fall into the same, miserable cycle of emotional abuse. And in regards to your statement that maybe he needs a specific physical appearance to be a better partner—being a good partner is not at all contingent on what your partner physically looks like. He is letting his strong, intense, fleeting positive emotions make his decisions right now. He (and likely his relationship) will ultimately suffer the consequences.

"My ex wasn't moronic enough to immediately marry but she did immediately hop into another long term relationship and honestly to me, that's just a sign of emotional immaturity and a fear of being alone. She relied on someone to constantly emotionally cater to her so she couldn't be alone. I hardly feel any resentment over that tbh. It wasn't worth getting jealous over and now looking back I kinda just pity her that she didn't take any time to figure herself out and find herself on her own like I did. It definitely helped prepare me for my current relationship monumentally better than just immediately jumping over to the next one like I intially attempted to after her. 

That's the healthiest way to do a breakup and when people hop relationships it usually is indicative of their own tumultuous inner mental state. I did exactly what you did after my breakup (after admittedly having a drunken depression phase) I focused on loving and healing myself, getting physically fit, reopening hobbies and starting therapy.

"It takes two to tango. No reasonable excuse for him to make such a life changing decision on his part to ditch you. Looking back on that 5 year relationship, you can ask yourself this, ""Did you both grow apart or grow closer?"" If you did your part, then you are not the problem. If he was the one  pulling you down to achieve your goals within the relationship then you met a ""kid"". Sometimes, we really can't tell what the future holds, but we can hope for a better future after depressing moments of our life.

Yes, you became his testing center how to handle his next relationship , but he can't deny his conscience that you made him a better person. And, a very sad and tragic reality that you are not his ending story . However, be brave that this is the best opportunity for you to move on and be a better person for yourself because you have loved beyond your limits, beyond what your mind and heart can comprehend.

"I'm 21 years old and live in a 3rd world country were pedophilia is STILL a crime but one that goes rarely punished.

Ok so background, I have a younger cousin who is the embodiment of pretty, she has the brunette hair and caramel eyes with white skin that everyone wants to pamper. She just turned 15 a month ago and she has been having problems at school for flirting too much with the boys on her class and for going around dating most of them for like 2 days and then breaking up with them.
The other party in this story is her cousin who is 20 years old. He has always been her ""favorite cousin"" and he has always been very close to her even at a younge age, so was I since me and him are on the same age levels.

My family is in disarray right know because of what we found out some days ago. My aunt took away my cousin's phone and found a picture of them 2 naked in the living room. She of course freaked out and called his parents (Her fucking brother might I add) and the closest direct family members, no 2nd cousins and no like neighbors or any shit like that. We did an intervention on the guy to get the complete story of what happened and of what they did to see if there was any hope that it might have not gone all the way. It did.
They have been in a sexual relationship since around 5 months ago. My stomach fucking dropped since I was always close to him and he had always been the type of guy to defend the little one or try and help the runts of any group; has always been the ""He wouldn't even hurt a fly"" guy.

His dad and her aunt are trying to come to terms and figure out what to do since like, we all know that my cousin's behavior had some degree in what happened BUT SHE IS STILL A KID and the one person who was THE ADULT couldn't make a right decision. Her mom is mad, rightfully so, but it doesn't look like she will place charges. His dad is making up so many plan B's to try and save him from certain death since if you go to jail and it gets out you're either a cop or a pedophile then the next day you'll be found dead

It's taken me all my strength and my neutral ness to not report this to the authorities (And frankly it's not my place to report anything since I have never seen any evidence of anything thank the gods).

The worse part is that this is triggering me so much I cannot live a normal life right now. I, as an AFAB person who grew up with the internet, have been groomed by men older than me and to this day I regret putting my 11 year old naked body out there in the hands of those sickos.

I went into a stress and disgust spiral since in these past 5 months I have been in the same room as him. I was in the same room as a pedophile, I was joking with a pedophile, I was laughing with a pedophile, I hugged a pedophile, I shared a room for a sleepover with a pedophile. It's the worse fucking scenario.

I confided all of this with someone close to me and he told me something I would never expected to hear. He is the light of the party, the support guy, the one who is always trying to help people around him so I was crying from shock when he admitted to me that he was molested as a child. He said he has NEVER shared that with anyone, that's why I am not putting any more details out there, but he shared it to me to try and make me understand that yes, it fucking hurts and yes it should NEVER be forgiven, but you cannot let that anger and remorse control your life.

I am trying my best to live my life as normal as I can right now since it's the best that I can do for myself. Before anyone says to report him to the authorities I am already this conflicted and in emotional distress as it is, I will not be the one to pull the lever on that man's life, I could not bare the burden of that. As much as I hate his crime and it makes me physically sick to look at him now he was still at some point a good man. That man died the moment that he did what he did and now just a body is walking around, waiting to either get away with it or get punished.

I am only sharing this since I bet on my life that all of this situation is going to become one of those ""It's a family secret"" situation and I could not handle that burden for the rest of my life. I just want to go away from all of this shit and just live my life as normal, I hope that's not too much to ask.

Also, I think you should check in with your 15f cousin and try to offer all the support you can. It sounds like she might not even know why what happened was wrong.

Paedophilia is an attraction to pre pubescent children, it's a mental health condition and it's always thrown around for any age under 18 which takes away from its original meaning.

"Unpopular opinion:

This is two kids being dumb and naive and having too little self control

Pedophile is being attracted to prepubescent children. OPs cousin is 15, has clearly hit puberty (girls hit puberty way before men), and depending on specifics is not necessarily a child. This is not even remotely similar to if the 20 year old was seducing a 10 year old. It seems extremely likely the 15 year old was making eyes at him.

NOW I AM NOT CONDONING THIS BEHAVIOR, I'm not saying it's okay, it's not. what I am saying is that this isn't pedophilia in it's general sense, this is two kids, slightly too far apart in age, being dumb. The 15 year old girl should understand that there are a lot of potential dangers to this kind of thing, and she's likely to harbor emotional damage, and the 20 year old needs to understand that his age puts him in a position of status and influence over her, and that even though she consented, it's his responsibility to look out for her wellbeing.

If it's well known that pedophiles are killed in prison in this country, then I think it's a terrible idea to go to the cops. This 20 year old guy who had a lapse in judgement is going in a cell with some 35 year old felon who only knows 20M got a felony statutory rape charge, likely not knowing whether it was really a child, or just a teen. Is death a reasonable punishment for this 20M's actions? Hell no are you kidding?

Should this be brushed off? Definitely not! Please help make sure these two understand the forces at play and can make better decisions in the future, but it doesn't sound like the law system here is equipped to do that, so keeping it in the family makes a ton of sense.

&#x200B;

NOTE: I have a very close female relative who confided in me that another male relative SA'd her. The male held a position of trust and used it to manipulate and assaulter her. I personally called the cops on the assaulter, and worked with the female relative for months to help her through the trial, help her readjust to life, make sure she had a therapist, and could become self-reliant. I'm not coming from a macho alpha misogynistic perspective, I just think a ton of these comments are missing the point. This was not an intentional rape (which deserves castration or capital punishment), this was not an intentional sexual manipulation (which I think deserves the same), this was stupidity and naivety."

This is still wrong but labeling him as pedo is still questionable. I am not defending him and as I said it is wrong, but you are throwing the word pedo too much… is he genuinely attracted or sexually attracted to kids… I know your cousin is a minor but there is a relative close age gap and the mentioned behaviour of the girl cousin is also something to be questioned. Does he forced her into sex or could it be that the girl is the one who asked for it… not that it is right because as I said it is wrong.

"Ok so, Update.

Thanks everyone for giving your insight and support. There were some weird stuff here but I am just going to chuck it up to culture shock. Here is the outcome of this:

The mom ain't going to place charges. She doesn't want the image of her being a good mom to be tarnished and her daughter to be thought of in a bad light (I know that this excuse is fucking stupid and frankly disgusting but it's not my place to decide, not my mom, not my child).

I talked with the guy about how fucking disgusted I am of him and why, I told him about my grooming past since he didn't know and I told him that is why I needed to just not talk to him anymore until I feel mentally prepared to deal with my own trauma.

The one thing that scares me is that this guy is starting college, going out with his friends, living a normal life, and if you looked at him on the streets you would never think he did that. He says he is remorseful but I can only see him regretting the fact that he got caught.

I'm trying to not let it affect me since I already have enough shit to deal with personally with my brother and my mom being a bit too dependant on my paycheck. I'll leave everything behind me and if it ever resurfaces or my cousin wants my support in any way I will be there to try and help her out.

Here in Mexico there's a trend of mob mentality and people will most likely try and take justice into their own hands if this issue were to come to light so I'm just choosing to not be the one fawning the flames. If the fire breaks out tho, I will not stop myself from chucking more fuel into that shit.

This issue has affected and divided our family greatly, his dad cannot even go and face his own mother anymore since my cousin lives with our grandma. My family told his family that if she were to go public we would support her and not him and his dad fully agreed but begged us to not try and coerce the girl to come out and say it. We won't, it's her choice to deal with that trauma whenever she is ready since for her 15 year old brain she got ""forcefully separated"" from ""someone that she loved and loved her back"" and she took it as a really bad breakup. It will take time for her to see and understand what happened to her.

Guys. I know I used the word pedophile a lot in my post since to me who English is my second language is the only possible way to refer to a person who has had sex with someone under the age of 18. I truly believe that he shouldn't be thought of nothing less than a pedophile.

Besides this I will no longer give updates on the situation out of respect of the victim and her family's wishes. I hope y'all can learn from this and take better care of your cousins, little sisters or even children. Protect them and don't let anything not anyone hurt them and use them like this."

In as much as it seems like a difficult decision to make, reporting the matter to the police is the right action to be taken against him. The legal system doesn't exempt close family offenders. in fact in other places he would be charged with incest which carries a harsher punishment. This clearly shows that the laws exist to shan sexual deviance. Protecting the predator at the expense of the victim is not the route to take. She's already traumatized by it and is even acting out. One day she'll realise what happened to her and how the family chose to protect her abuser. Let it be a difficult decision but it should be made. This is not a light matter that going for therapy will resolve. Protect the victim and let the predator face criminal charges. The situation is not nuanced, the excuse is that he's a family member and many unreported SA cases happen between members of the same family. She doesn't have to be another statistic. If you investigate the process of sexual grooming and the power play involved, you'd realise that a predator clearly knows what he's doing.You don't have to be the one to report the matter but some should.

"You gain nothing by doing anything, other than animosity or exile from your family. However, if what you think is a crime against humanity is more important than your family, then turn the guy in as a criminal. If you put your family above the laws of men, then let their parents deal with it.  


You may not see it this way, but they are both children. That is clear simply from the fact that he engaged in this behavior. Horny children do stupid things, and in this case, reprehensible things.  


If I was you, I would remove myself from any position to judge or do anything about this situation and let their parents handle it as they see fit. This will become a family secret as you say, but that isn't the worst outcome in the world. They will both be scarred from this and no one that knows this will trust the dude. He'll have his own burden to carry, he earned it by not controlling himself or having the ethics needed to avoid that disaster. The girl will hopefully leave this in the past, but you never know with this sort of thing.  


Just remember, people make mistakes. Sometimes those mistakes are pretty bad ones, like in this case, but they are still people. You don't have to forgive or even understand either of them for what they did. If the dude wants to know what you think, tell him without animosity or anger. Tell him he has failed his family and his own basic human decency. If she asks what you think, perhaps ask her why even pursue that sort of thing and offer her support if she needs it.  


There is also the fact that you'll never actually know what happened. They may have engaged in this willingly without any force or trickery or evil involved. Maybe he manipulated her and took advantage of her age. Maybe she seduced him in an attempt to explore her sexuality. Only they know what happened, don't try to pretend and don't allow your family to pretend like they know what happened. People are weird and creepy, for sure. Sometimes they are just stupid and make bad choices together.

"This will probably get downvoted due to the close-minded, western brainwashed kids but I will give my opinion.

The young girl should be counselled and loved by her family and support should be shown to her to help her feel like it’s not completely her fault. Both parties have a part of the blame more so the older 20 year old, however this may be the one and only moment he let his brain fall into the void of darkness which led him to an act of pedophilia. I don’t agree with what he did but telling others about it would bring more damage to the family and him in particular. In these cases the girl would rarely get the blame, but who knows the situation she had been involved in relationships before and enticed him into the room, as unlikely as it is the chance of that isn’t 0. 
The fact she has been involved in relationships before might make her a more mature individual but unfortunately due to her age, apparently, she isn’t allowed to make her own decisions.

I feel sorry for all involved. But I would definitely keep a lid on it if there is a real chance of him getting murdered, fucking hell. In my country, children are now allowed to stay in government housing until the age of 24. Simplified, a child that is homeless will be housed by the state in some capacity. Altho the capacity is typically very grim, they are no longer just “turned out” when they reach the age of 18. A 20-year-old is still very capable of having the mentality (and decision making skills) of a child. And a 15-year-old is old enough to be mentally/emotionally dictated by hormones..while having the decision making skills of a child..as you well know. It sounds like you were absolutely preyed upon at 11. However, between 15 and 20, this sounds more like human children being bad together.

"Let me put it this way for you. When she was basically a baby at the age of 5, he was 10! 

Now would you wanna fuck the sister you grew up with? Pretty screwed up if you ask me, considering their mental age and physicality. 

I am a woman and come from a 3rd world country too. So I have experienced this personally. Because of culture many are adamant that a relationship between an adult and teen is not that big of a deal but little do they understand the negative impact it has on the victims (children). 

I have heard many household wives who were married off young, well before the age of 20, regret their life decisions.

When I was 13, I was sexualised by a bunch of 18 year olds. When either of them wanted to be with me, I felt disgusted because I looked up to them as  my own brothers. 

I had difficulty cutting them off at first and felt pressured to socialize. Yes, to socialize because indeed in a country like mine a bunch of teens would be mutually linked to young adults.This one time, my friend (13F) who knew no better than me, was persuaded by one of them, let us call him X, to get me alone. She thought it would be ""romantic.""  She invited me out and I thought it would be just us girls, until I saw X lurking in the corner. I immediately knew something was off. She tried to force me in his direction, begging me to give him a chance. Mind you, he wanted me to be alone but he himself was not alone, there was another man with him. The alarm bells inside my head went off and I darted home. For the first time in my life, I finally understood the dangers revolving around such age gaps. The following week, a girl(13F) I never met before contacted me and warned me not to get with X for the sake of my own safety. This girl was his Ex. Apparently he had groomed her, had sex with her, and spread her nudes all over the internet. In fact, it was all public, and I saw them for myself. I was absolutely distraught. I genuinely felt bad for her but thanked her for the warning, though it was a tad bit late for that. Last I heard X was in prison.

These victims are young, lost and pressured by peers and pedophiles alike, and are therefore, easy to manipulate. By the time they are old enough to understand, the deed is already done and regrets are made. Likewise, these victims rarely speak up because of what society might think of them. I was one of them, I feared what my friends may think of me if I labeled X a disgusting pedophile. He was very popular among the members of our circle."

My point is that we need to stop acting like if you’re under 18 you’re a child: at 15 years old you’re capable of making you’re own choices, whether they are good or bad.

What OP is saying is that where he's from, if a person goes to jail and it's found out why when it pertains to pedophelia...he will likely be killed. So in their head, reporting him would most likely be a death sentence, not from the legal system but from other people in the jail.Just for clarification, I don't agree with that mentality...OP doesn't want to be judge, jury, and executioner. They are not saying they are ok with it, in fact they came here to express the guilt of why they haven't reported it.  It's just a norm in some 3rd world countries...and it happens in the US. If you are in general population or even worse, murderers (most still don't do shit to kids) they have a higher chance of being killed.  You've got the right idea and you're not wrong, but how will it look if OP reports him and NONE of his family back it up. Ntm losing rapport with their entire family. You have to see both sides here. The guilt is eating OP alive because OP knows how deeply it will affect their life if they're the only one to report him. I would have difficulty with this too because losing your entire family over something like this, sucks. So both sides of this are understandable. SOMEONE should report him, but OP isn't comfortable being the one who does.	JustADumbPansexual	reply	na	na	na	0.9865579009056091	no	no	no	na	offmychest	failed

"I understand the “save the best for last” when it is a thought out, planned essay.

However, I don’t think most people on Reddit are sitting down and truly planning their response out where the most important point comes last.

Instead, most people tend to respond to what they focus on first when reading. It’s like a stream of consciousness- you write what comes to mind first and go from there. Therefore, if you write about the abuser first, that was your focal point. This is coming though from teaching a wide range of ages in multiple countries for over a decade, students who tend write that way initially for responses to random prompts. 

This doesn’t mean that this holds true for everyone, just that it is *extremely* common in writing.

You do raise an excellent point- that people also do not read the entire comment. I do think that people’s tendency to skim read plays a factor in that and ties back into what I said about order=focus.

"Me (25m) and my girlfriend (27f) have been dating for roughly 2 years now. Some months before she met me, she was in a love relationship with a 59 year-old man that she kept a secret except to some close friends. They knew each other because they are from the same place and their families are acquainted (He knows her parents and shares their age). This individual is somewhat of a high profile figure, so here and there, I see him on newspapers covers and giving out interviews.

When I found out I started to read said interviews and discovered he was, and still is, married to this woman with whom he shares 3 kids, the eldest being 18. I confronted my girlfriend about this information she left out, and she claims he tricked her into thinking he was getting a divorce and was no longer with his wife. She even said that after she discovered, she stopped seeing him. Although I know she was still talking to him after that.

Fast forward to now, whenever we go to visit her family, this man's name and his family get mentioned quite a lot and it makes me feel super uncomfortable. I feel like I'm an extra in an awfully written soap opera. I've brought this multiple times to my girlfriend's attention, but she says she will never acknowledge they had an affair because it would break the heart of her family, and that she didn't tell them them because she knew they wouldn't approve of the age differential.

We share drastically different pasts. I have only been in one long dated relationship, whilst she has had dozens of sexual partners with little commitment. That never bothered me much, but this particular relationship is killing me.

I never thought of myself as being an insecure individual. I think I got dealt a decent hand when it comes to looks, I can socialize reasonably well and have quite a successful career for my age, but this is having me second guessing. A part of me wants to dismiss this as something that's in the past and just move on, but another part of me thinks this is not reasonable behaviour.

Am I being an insecure little shit or is this situation as ridiculous as it plays out in my head?"	Puzzled-Calendar7288	post	27.166812791960723	male	White	0.9983166456222534	na	na	na	2	offmychest	no prediction.

"Hi guys.

Forgive any bad grammar you might see. 

I  F(19) was sexually assaulted as a child by my older cousin. I was four, he was almost 13. To summarise this quickly my parents found out and I received therapy from child protective services from then onwards. I do not know if he was made to see someone or if he got in any trouble. Part of my psychologist's advice was to keep me away from any intimacy in future. So until I was 13 I wasn’t even allowed to watch a kiss in a movie. Now where things get complicated is I had lost my memory of this event. But I think the trauma has always been there. I struggled a lot growing and in my teenage years, I slowly began to get bits and pieces back. But I could never tell what was real and what wasn’t. I always knew something happened and tried to put together what I could, but I had no way to know if I was making up memories to fill in the blank parts. Although I couldn’t clearly remember the event has had lasting effects on my life regarding intimacy, there are other things I could list but I don’t want to stray off-topic. One night when I was 16 I broke down to my mother and asked her if something had happened to me. She didn’t tell me anything that night. It wasn’t until I turned 18 and moved states to live with my more distant relatives (aunts/cousins) that I finally got the confirmation I’d desperately wanted for so long. My aunt ended up telling me everything and I was so upset with my mother for having the opportunity to tell me and not doing it. She told me as I got older she thought of telling me so many times but was convinced by my other family that if I didn’t remember why tell me? Suddenly everything started to click. My aunt (my abuser's mum) had always treated me differently. While she made my other cousins extravagant birthday cards and gave them pretty gifts, I would receive a visibly cheaper gift and no card. I had grown up feeling like she hated me.  

Now getting to the issue at hand. My family has since been invalidating what happened to me, saying things like “You were so young it doesn’t matter now”, or they say they think he has something wrong with him mentally and that’s why he did it. On one hand I can understand their intentions but on the other, I know how long I’ve lost my mind unknowingly over this and still can’t commit to a relationship as a result. One day my aunt was picking me up from work and as I got into the car I saw she was on the phone to my abuser's mum (my aunt) and I was then forced to have a conversation with her. Ever since finding out properly, I’ve wanted nothing to do with her and it hurts seeing my close family engage with her. Her son abused me, a child still in nappies but yet you have a problem with me!?! 

If my cousin had a “mental disability” why didn’t she take him to get diagnosed? What preventive measures did she take to ensure he wouldn’t repeat what he did? He has a wife and two kids now. I feel sick thinking about it. What if he does something to them too? Why does he get to be happy? 
I understand my family don’t really speak to my cousin himself but from time to time I see them tagged on his Facebook posts and all I feel is Rage. It feels so unfair and I really can’t talk about this to anyone because I’m not getting taken seriously. 

I guess I just wanna know if there are other CSA survivors out there that could tell me if what happened to me is assault. Even tho I wasn’t penetrated? Is this really nothing? 

Am I wrong for not wanting my family to have contact with them? Am I wrong for feeling so betrayed?

I could really use some help. I feel like I can’t heal, even tho I have the confirmation I didn’t make it up. I feel so alone."	Intrepid-Suspect-585	post	26.419169340490303	female	White	0.011927120387554169	na	na	na	1	offmychest	no prediction.

"Straight to the point.

Single mother addicted to oxy and did handfuls of drugs and alcohol while pregnant with me. 

My brother would beat on me and lock me in rooms growing up. He would never do anything good that siblings would do. We never shared, played, or did anything positive together. He would keep me from having fun or being able to play with certain games or toys by hogging them past the point of him wanting to. 

Chores and tasks we were assigned to ended up with a fight between us. Every year we would be told to rake leaves. He would give up immediately and beat on me to make sure I would finish. My mom never did much and would only get mad when I would give up and go inside. My brother didn't get in trouble, but I would if I didn't feel like it was fair. 

Fast forward to collegeISH days ------------------

Older brother had everything paid for. Grandma helped him buy a new car so he could save his money for college living. I went to 2 semesters of a cheaper school only to be told I need to work and pay my way through college. 

Obviously I couldn't afford college anymore. My brother finished his master's and then Grandma offered to pay off his college loans and debt.

This same Grandma who calls me her ""favorite"" is always asking why I didn't finish college. ""Money should never have been an issue. It's okay, college isn't for everyone."" Though the reason I dropped out was because of a 1500/semester charge which isnt expensive for schooling. 

Fast forward to today -----------------------------------

Mental health has been very poor. Doing what I can to get myself treatment with the resources I have. Having trouble finding a job that pays all of my basic bills. Mother is always telling me everything I do is half assed and done poorly. Always telling me I'm negative and need to get my shit together. 

My brother is a successful accountant; family knows this and reminds me ""you had potential too"". He constantly shits on me whenever I think we have some kind of positive relationship building up. I'm a fool as if this doesn't follow the same cycle. 

He had a son and got married. I did everything I could to be a part of his life and stay involved but my brother doesn't keep up or update me at all. I gave up triple texting him about my nephew when my mother told me he's already walking, talking, and going to school. I understand he's busy being a parent, but everyone in the family gets to FaceTime him and get sent photos and videos of the new baby completing milestones. 

I'm the youngest in my immediate family. I'm the youngest of my family's generation by 15 years. 

Nearly every day I contemplate suicide because I just can't fake the enthusiasm anymore. 

I'm 24 and life is so much more difficult and intense each year. There's not much to love or appreciate but I try and continue to do both. Sharing helps despite knowing 3 people may read this."

It was supposed to be a job for the long term. But today they told me they are not going to give me a new contract. I'm devastated and very sad...
For a few months things were not going very smooth, I worked hard but it was never enough and they always had negative feedback. I also didn't feel very good in the team, like I didn't belong here. I hoped we could work on it, I already planned with a coach to learn for myself how to deal with difficulties during my job. But they fired me anyway.

I also don't know what to do next. I always wanted to be a midwife but now I'm not so sure anymore. I don't want this kind of pressure anymore, the responsibility and working days and nights, 24 hour shifts. But I also love it very very much. Helping mothers and catching babies is the best thing in the world.

I don't know how to tell anyone, of course my husband knows but it feels like I failed and that I will let everyone down. I also told nobody about the difficulties I had at my job so it will be a big surprise that I will not work here anymore.
I'm ashamed and very sad. Thank you for reading  this, it is going all places but nice to write it down."	midwife_97	post	28.044957710632218	female	White	0.9989663362503052	na	na	na	4	offmychest	no prediction.

"So I recently got a new job that pays better than my previous job by a decent amount but the work/life balance was not there whatsoever unfortunately and I constantly felt like I was falling behind everyone else even after voicing my concerns. They expected me to work during my lunch break and come in when there’s an emergency all of which was not clearly stated on my contract. After attempting to stick the job out for 2 months I eventually caved and I am now going back to my previous job where I’m comfortable with the work/life balance and I like my old co-workers more.

My supervisor (M30) and I (23F) had sex twice and I sucked his dick all within these past three weeks. I’m new at this job so I guess the sexual tension between us was there. But ever since we had sex and etc, he’s been acting a little bit distant and a little harsh. He was all nice and joked around with me before we had sex, but now he has been giving me unfavorable work hours, short with me, and don’t talk to me as much anymore. It just felt like I was being used, and honestly it makes me sad and regretful. He probably just sees me as a naive girl who would let anyone have sex with her. Everyone thinks of him as a very controlling and sarcastic person, and he’s particularly harsh to most of the male workers; but he’s sweeter and kinder to attractive women workers. It’s been a little over a month and I just don’t know what to do. I probably know that we won’t have sex anymore because I had to have a conversation with him the other day regarding how we feel about each other. He did say that nothing changes and that he’s still my boss and will get mad when I do things wrong, etc. How do I make our work relationship the way it was before we had sex? I honestly wished I never had sex with him because before we did, he would be a little bit kinder and be flirtatious with me (casually). I guess because he already had sec with me, there’s nothing to really chase after and put up a facade of being a friendly boss anymore to impress or woo me. I know this is really inappropriate but just wanted some advice. Thank you!	Funny-Ad7125	post	18.32873592712251	female	White	0.998256266117096	na	na	na	4	offmychest	failed

Give him some space. Stop telling him you’ve changed and actually show him by changing. Do better. Then when you are proud of how you’ve changed you can reach out to him with an apology and examples of how you’ve changed.

My dad has always been a good person, people would tell me how much of a great person he is. I would just smile and agree, sometimes even saying a few praises myself. But in reality, I was the only one in my family who knew what really went on in my dads life, or at least no one wanted to acknowledge it. My dad adopted my half sister (let’s just say Jessica)  right after I was born. Jessicas biological dad didn’t want anything to do with her and my mom made it worse by telling her that her dad was my other half sisters dad. This wasn’t true as the three of us all have different dads. So when my other sisters dad came to pick her up, he never paid any attention to Jessica and it really got to her. There were always issues, Jessica was 14 now and was skipping school so much that she faced truancy. My aunt and uncle offered to take her in for the next school year and have her go to school in Virginia. That’s when it got really bad, turns out my uncles entire plan was to get Jessica over there so he could groom her. He made her believe he loved her and so she kept it a secret. My mom gets a call from her sister saying that her daughter is terrible things, that she, a 14 year old, seduced her 45 year old husband and made him cheat on her. My moms side of the family, Jessica’s biological side, put all the blame on Jessica and defended the adult that manipulated my sister. Not long after the court case, Jessica ran away. And by the time she came back, she was 16 years old and addicted to meth. She attempted multiple times and was admitted into multiple mental facilities. Fast forward 10 years and she’s still addicted to meth and is in and out of jail. She turned to prostitution to make money. By this time she was 26 and I was 14. She was more in touch with me and my dads side now, but she still wasn’t doing good. I first started to notice excessive touching between my dad and my sister. When they’d hug, he’d squeeze her butt, right in front of me too. I immediately was creeped out and instantly I thought the worst. I kept watching them and it got weirder and weirder. One day, my dad left his phone at home when he went to the store so I went through it. I went through their messages and my suspicions were confirmed. My dad texting things like, “I wanna see your beautiful ass I love you so much”. Obviously that’s way over the line for a father daughter relationship. But I already knew that. But I didn’t want to know that, I didn’t want to believe. So I pushed it down and hid it from everyone. I started losing sleep over it and ended up developing anxiety pretty soon after. I stopped going to school and lost all my friends. I was suffering because of what I knew. But I put on a good act for my family. I even covered for my dad when he would get careless. I didn’t want anyone to know what my dad was really like. I didn’t want to accept it. I still don’t, honestly I’m still confused about it even though I’ve seen more than enough. But it’s getting to me, it’s ruined my life. I dropped out of highschool because I couldn’t deal with the anxiety it brought on, now I’m 20 without ever having a job or a car and it’s all because I decided that I needed to be the glue that held what was left of our family together. Sad thing is, it’s still going on as I type this. Nothings changed, if anything everyone around me has become even more oblivious to the situation. I don’t know what to do.

It’s hard because it would mean damaging the relationship I have with two people I didn’t mention. I have another sister, but she’s my full sister, so we share the same dad. And the sister I mentioned in the situation with my dad has a daughter, my niece. My sisters already on rocky grounds with the father of my niece and he wouldn’t hesitate to completely shut me and my full sister out of her life. And about my full sister, she kinda idolizes my dad. After my mom had an affair and left us, my dad was always there for us. He showed up to every game, event, etc… even before my mom left he was really the only one to actually show us parental love. I know it’s wrong, and I’m doing my best to get myself into a job so I can start becoming independent, but it’s just scary thinking about what could potentially happen to the two relationships I still care about.

I feel that my only option would be to get a job with accommodation to help me move back.

"I recently became a dad and I was so excited for it! The pregnancy and birth was about as smooth as one could expect and I couldn't wait to enter parenthood.

But holy shit, I cannot stand this newborn phase. Waking every 2 hours to feed. Constant crying. Not being able to settle my kid after trying to burp/feed/change them and not know what's wrong, which only leads to more wailing. I feel absolutely no connection to this child because theres no 2-way communication at the moment. Days are a constant blur of feeds and nappies with no joy or reward in return.

Bless my wife, she's an absolute trooper and is doing everything she can, including putting up with my shitty, sorry behaviour.  But in the brief moments of silence, or when I'm out the house for work, I can't help but think how much better life was before we had this kid.

Then there's the constant comments from those around me: 'don't forget to remember your kid when they're this age', 'get all the newborn cuddles you can get', 'you'll miss the newborn stage when they're older',  'they're so cute at this age!' Get. Absolutely. Fucked. Why would I want to remember a time when I barely got any sleep, was useless at comforting my own child and basically felt so frustrated that I wish I could turn back time to how life was before the birth?!

I sincerely hope it gets better sooner rather than later. I work with teens and young adults, so I'm hoping that when the kid is a little older, can react and interact with me and start to actually communicate that I'll have a better time with parenting. I won't feel as useless and defeated.

If it doesn't, I honestly don't know I'll cope for the next how-many-ever years.

"*apology beforehand about all the euphemisms, I’ve had to edit this many times so it won’t get taken down*
I, (17M) have had a very difficult relationship with my father in recent years. Growing up and just as I hit my teenage years he was a great father and was always kind to my mom. He was your typical dad who would go to work for an ok paying job and come home always in a good mood and we were always glad to see him. So life was pretty normal. 

However, starting in early 2019 one day he suddenly decided to leave my mom because she had a, quote, “drinking problem”. My mom and the rest of us were in shock because my mom does not drink. My mom was heartbroken and couldn’t understand why he would do that. We later found out it’s because he decided to leave her for a woman almost half his age (he was mid 40s and she was early 20s). The next few months were a really dark time in my life, my mom got depression and anxiety and I couldn’t stand to look at my dad. Most nights I spend sleeping on the chair in my moms room because I wanted to comfort her when she was all on her own and try to find a solution to this. All the while my dad was crashing at his friends houses and being unfaithful. Not even a month or so into this situation, the truth got out that my dad had left his wife and kids for a younger woman and everyone he and my mom knew were in support of us. Even his entire family and his brother (my uncle, who we hadn’t spoken to in years over the death of my grandad) reached out to my mom to give her support.
However a few months later I came home from school ready to take on another night of looking after my mom, she came downstairs to greet me and told me how she and my dad had come to an agreement on getting back together. I was in shock on how she could do this because of all the pain he had put her through. Apparently she did it for a stable life, and so we wouldn’t have to leave the house we’d lived in for 12 years at that point and just leave. However I knew inside that he is not the man who I called my father. 

The next couple of years were calm, things weren’t as good as they were but covid just made us have to get along. Now here’s we’re it gets worse. Starting in around 2022 my dads mental stability was at an all time low. It hadn’t been great throughout covid either but it was somewhat manageable. But now he had turned drastically. Not only was he mentally a different person, but also physically. Before, he was a very muscular and lean guy, but now he was overweight and had gotten shorter. And his behaviour can only be described as abusive. He will often be physical towards me, my mom and my two younger siblings, I.E. punchh and k1ck and use the excuse it’s just a game when called on it, however none of use agree to it and quite frankly hate it. He will get mad over small things in the evening and will go out drinking and we won’t see him until the next day. He is and alcoholic who drinks from morning till whenever he goes to sleep. He will make inappropriate comments towards the way my sister looks or dresses which considering she’s 15 (nearly 16) is very f’ed up. He will sometimes even grab me or my sister inappropriately and when I get mad or she looks visibly upset by it, he will turn it round on us and say “why are you getting so mad at a joke” one time I had enough after he had made a comment on my sisters outfit and later smacked her butt, and that was a massive breaking point for me, I have been doing boxing and jui jitsu for a few years now and I absolutely unloaded on him. Later in the evening he had managed to manipulate my mother and lie to make her think it was my fault and I got grounded for 2 months, my sister however did thank me a lot. He is very discriminatory and whenever he sees a black/Asian man he will shout slurs, never loud enough so they hear him, and when you call him out he’ll have some bullshit excuse and lecture on how it’s not racist. If he saw a gay or trans person, he would probably do the same. However around other people, my dad is a completely different person and tries to please them the best he can, he paints himself out to be a family man, who loves his wife and kids. I also forgot to mention the things he call me, my mom and my siblings, he calls my mom and I a “see you next tuesday” and my sister derogatory terms towards women, or a manipulative female dog.  I can’t help but blame my mom for taking him back all those years ago, I know she had good intentions, but now it makes my life a living misery and I can’t help but blame my mom a tiny bit, taking him back should have been way too big of a red flag for her to miss. Also you should note she won’t divorce him because she says we’d have to move and because I’m in my senior year and my sister will be next year, she doesn’t want to take us out of our current schools. She’s also said how I can’t move away for college because she doesn’t wanna be without me whilst my dad is around, and I should attend the college that’s near where we live, I have apologised but said there’s no way I could stay when the option to leave is on the cards. 

This brings me to yesterday where my dad was in another bad mood telling me that I was a terrible son and making fun of the battles I’ve recently had with depression (which is ironic because he is majorly responsible for that) and I snapped and said how as soon as I leave I will cut all contact with him, and my mom too unless she finally divorced him. he will not be at my wedding, he will not meet my children, he will simply not exist to me or them. Why would I want a man who behaves like that to interact with my children. He’s now saying how I’m a massive asshole and again managed to get my mom on his side, pulling out the crocodile tears and asking how I could be so cruel to someone who’s looked after me my whole life. I felt nothing, I went upstairs and locked my door and was flooded with texts from him and my mom on how wrong I was to say that. So, I’m looking for clarity, is what my dad has done abuse and was I wrong for saying that. Also any advice would be greatly appreciated :)"	charleysroberts1917	post	19.512515416127762	female	White	0.9913315773010254	na	na	na	2	offmychest	failed

"I used to be in a friendly relationship with a person that I had only known for about 2 years, I’ll call him Jack. I blame myself for not knowing it before, but there were MAJOR red flags from this guy. Jack would constantly hop between girlfriends and would blame them every single time the relationship ended.
  

  
After a somewhat serious relationship, Jack came to me and asked me to vent to him. Jack would talk about su\*c\*de and a lot of self harm. Obviously, I comforted him and I gave him advice on being better. What I didn’t realize was that this had prolonged for over a year. I had to face the hard fact that he was using me as a vent buddy, and I knew this because most of my advice phased right through him and he switched up moods between people.
  

  
At the beginning of the year, Jack had fallen in love with a girl that he pursued for months WHILE dating other girls. The main girl (I’ll call her Sia) that he pursued had said no in the past, but since it was a new year Sia said yes. He came to me all proud saying he bagged the girl and honestly was happier with her life. 
  

  
I became more distant over the months and I wasn’t aware of the situation. Until one of my friends sent me a screenshot of Jack saying she wanted to f\*nger and f\*ck the sh\*t out of Sia (his exact words). My friends and I were really concerned for her and tried our best to convince Sia to break up with Jack. However, Jack had trapped Sia by saying that he would commit su\*c\*de if he left.
  

  
Despite our hardest efforts, we couldn’t convince Sia hard enough. This issue has bothered me for a while now, and I am coming to the community of Reddit to ask you guys for advice. Please let us know what we should do.

"I'm just a 27 years old woman and I don't think I'm so relevant to be loved. Maybe I'm one of those people that's not made for that. It's not like I've never had a relationship: I have. It's just I always feel so unimportant and forgettable, sometimes even objectified. As a teenager I was always outcasted so I never had a relationship back then, I even used to have this mindset at 15 in which I believed that if I had to find someone it had to be someone with no close friends nor family because I used to think they would be ashamed of having me as a gf. I grew up and got in my first rushed ""relationship"" at 20. I was used because I used to think I had to be content with what I could get and I was lonely so I grew attached to this guy who was not good for me. It lasted a month and he found someone else a week later. Then spent many years chasing some crush who gave me mixed signals as he knew I liked him; he was inexperienced, lonely and tried taking advantage of the situation to get nudes. It was a situation in which I also became sort of overprotective of him and his problems. I moved on after 4 years chasing, and I got in another relationship with a good guy a year later. It was also rushed, as he kissed me on the first hangout together and I couldn't say anything. He was a good person, definitely, but even the first months we were together he used to send me unsolicited gore-ish and 🌽content the first months of dating. I never spoke up about how bothered I was by that. Even when he asked for nudes I used to get kinda triggered due to my past experience with the other guy. We ended up in a relationship that lasted one year and a half, until I believe everything came up and I became completely repulsed at even touching him and I couldn't control it. He used to be so good to me though, drove 50km to see me, took me on vacations or to eat pancakes... to the point everyone looked at me as a monster for wanting to break up. As we broke up he found another girl the following month, which was relieving for me as I had spent the whole time feeling guilty over hurting him. And my former crush/friend started hitting on me for his lack of experience and loneliness after I broke up, then stopped talking to me as he himself got a gf. Currently I have a ""situation-ship""(?) with someone that defines me a friend but honestly doesn't value me other than my body.

I think I make a ton of mistakes here because I don't think I was ever really loved due to how unimportant I've always felt in every single one of these experiences. I don't really think anyone could choose me, especially considering how nowadays the world is full of options and people always look for more. It feels as if I'm only good when useful. And all they want is my body, they have no interest in getting to know me as a person."

"How naive i was :) Applied as early as possible, with details and care to every file description so that it would be easier for the officer.

So I (18f) very stupidly hanged out with this guy i barely knew one night, we had been calling for a bit and after I had got home from work he asked if he wanted to pick me up and drive around. I had told him explicitly in the call before that I wasn’t comfortable with physical touch really but he kept on insisting that he wouldn’t pressure me or was wanting to do anything sexual with me and that he just wanted to go for a drive (which obviously was a lie). Maybe I am just really naive and dumb, but I genuinely didn’t think he was only wanting to get me in his car and have sex with me, I thought he just wanted to drive around and talk & get to know me more or something. Fast forward to when were in his car, he drove somewhere up a hill (I know I should’ve said something or been aware what he was trying to do but in the moment I wasn’t really thinking clear) it was very late at night, he told me to get in the back seat and I did and he obviously immediately started touching me and kissing me, I pulled away and told him that I wasn’t comfortable or sure about it and kept pulling him away but he kept insisting/pressuring me to. I was honestly scared at that point and my mind kind of went blank, so I just went along with it in the moment. It kept progressing and he had tried to insert himself without even saying he was going to do so but he wasn’t able to get it in fully. I was a virgin and wasn’t wet as I didn’t want/expect to have sex with him in the first place. I guess it was my fault for going along with it and not standing up for myself more but I was so disgusted with myself after. He eventually took me home then immediately blocked me after too which made me feel way worse. I’ve been very disgusted with the fact that I even let myself get into that situation but I just have been needing to get it off my chest.

I'm sorry this happened to you.  Please don't blame yourself.  From the sounds of it.. this isn't this guy's first time doing this.  You froze, its a survival instinct and incredibly difficult to override, and its a very very common response. Your brain analyzed the situation and chose what it deemed the best way to keep you alive. He took you to a secluded place intentionally, he wanted you to feel alone, helpless, and scared for your safety so that you would comply.

Don't blame yourself, meeting someone going into his car at night still doesn't mean you agree to sex. If he doesn't accept your first no it's not consensual. The way you responded is common during sexual assault it's a freeze response. I hope this helps somehow in understanding that he has all the fault you have none.

"Listen, it’s really much harder to say what’s on your mind in the moment, especially with a new person. I once kicked myself after an encounter for not being more forceful with my voice. And this person gave me no red flags beforehand. In the moment it is much harder to recognize how wrong it is than it can be after the fact when you have more clarity. Do not kick yourself for how you reacted, you made your feelings clear from the beginning. 

Some men can be trusted when they make their intentions clear, some men cannot. You’re still very young and are new to having these interactions and you’ll learn to pick up on red flags and unreliable behavior. It is not your fault for taking a person at their word that they respect your boundaries. Even people who have been in relationships for a while wind up being horribly surprised by what their partner is capable of.

"Hey, you’re alive, and you got on here and are reaching out so to speak. That’s super commendable! Give yourself a Pat on the back for that seriously! It’s not easy after experiencing trauma to immediately deal with it, and that’s what you’re doing which is awesome!!

I would hope you wouldn’t have anything to worry about in this department but it’s better safe than sorry. I have got tested many times even when I pretty much knew I was fine I still did - especially when I have a new partner or something. Eases everyone’s mind.

Secondly, if you can, maybe look into therapy? I think everyone should have a therapist personally. 

What you shouldn’t do is chastise yourself. I imagine you already feel guilt and shame or as if it was your fault.

Please realize that you did absolutely nothing *wrong*, you trusted someone and they took advantage, took control, and completely violated and betrayed that trust in the most awful way short of killing someone. 

You can look at it as a lesson, and realize what toys do different next time: but a woman should be able to do whatever the fuck she wants without having to worry about this kind of stuff…unfortunately that’s not the world we live in.

Please know that you did nothing wrong. You were taken advantage of and you trusted someone and they betrayed that. That’s so so so awful. I’m sorry you had to go through this. But I hope you’ve learned a terrible lesson (you shouldn’t ever have to learn in the first place as a woman), which I’m sure woman will have many tips and tricks, ideas then I will, but just always have a back up plan, always have a way out. And any guy that gets mad at boundaries you set is not worth your time either. Boundaries should ALWAYS be respected, that respect means, NOT ASKING ID THE BOUNDARY CAN BE REMOVED.

"No. NO. ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NO. Do NOT blame yourself for this not for one fucking second. You did NOTHING WRONG at all. I'm a dude, and was at one point a shitty teenage boy who was pushier than he should have been and since learned and grew up a lot after it being brought to my attention by my at the time gf and actually listening to her and changing my bad behavior and can tell you that they know what they are doing. They are depending on the fact you will just give up and go with it. 

""I mean, she didn't say no. If she didn't want to do it, why didn't she stop me?"" 

It's plausible deniability on their part and a way to direct blame and responsibility for his actions into others and your reaction is unfortunately expected because you are fucking terrified and do not know what's going to happen and want to survive a potentially horrific / dangerous / scary experience. Humans have the fight, flight, or freeze response for a reason. In this instance your survival instinct kicked in and decided for you that the best way to survive this dangerous encounter was to let the scary man do what he wants so he doesn't get angry and hurt you worse than he would if he got what he wanted. 

It's a little thing called being the victim of a rape or sexual assault. 

Please, I'm begging you don't blame yourself for the horrible actions of someone else, you are the victim here and not at fault in the slightest.

"Im going to tell you something my brother told me after I experienced A VERY similar thing. I blamed myself for going to the guys house after only two dates. I told him before we agreed to hang out that I didn’t want anything sexual to happen, and he agreed that we would just hang out and nothing was going to happen. Long story short, he raped me. I asked him to stop once and then froze and just let it happen. I even pretended to enjoy it because he told me he wouldn’t stop until I’d cum, so to make it stop I faked an orgasm. My therapist told me I did what my brain told me I had to do to survive and get out of a dangerous situation.

When I told my brother I had been raped, he was furious and I thought he was furious at me (he wasn’t, he was filled with a murderous fucking rage at the man who had assaulted me), so I apologised and kept saying sorry I was so stupid and naive that I went to his house and let it happen.

It’s not on you. It wouldn’t even matter if you were lying in the car completely naked, the SECOND you told him you did not consent - whether it be physically or verbally - and he continues, he is a rapist.

If you reported this to the police, maybe they can look into your phone calls where you said you weren’t comfortable with physical touch and where he said he wasn’t gonna do anything sexual with you.

"love, you told him even before you got in the car that you wouldn’t even be comfortable with so much as a hug. he knew that then took advantage of you when you went into survival mode and froze. he knew what he was doing. 

something i haven’t seen other people add - it’s not on you to have to be ready and on guard for this to happen at any moment. i don’t see it as you being naïve, i see it as you wanting to go for a drive. that’s it. just a drive. okay you barely knew him, i don’t care honestly. i don’t care what you were wearing, that you got in the car, if you had anything to drink - you need to stop placing the blame on yourself. you didn’t put yourself in this situation, he did. he is at fault here, not you. 

i’m going to get personal here, the first time i was raped it was also my virginity and he also barely got it in for the same reasons, the trauma was still so hard and for years i questioned if it was my virginity or not. i know/knew virginity is a stupid concept in itself but it’s still so hard to deal with, i started tensing up when friends would start asking about first times. something that helped me was that losing your virginity means having sex. you didn’t have sex, you were raped. you have to have sex to lose your virginity, and sex means consent. you didn’t consent. this wasn’t your first time having sex hun, and i hope (whenever you’re comfortable and ready) it’s fun and awkward and safe. 

if your comfortable, report it. i’ve been through the courts and i’ll be honest, it’s hell. it’s fucked up. and it’s retraumatizing. during my court case though i was assaulted by a partner, and instead of going through another court case i reported it and said i was not ready or willing to go to court. but that report stays on file, if you ever want to pursuit it or if he does it to another girl and she comes forward - she can use your report in her case as proof. it’s something to think about, but what’s most important right now is healing and being okay. talk about it, scream if you need to, reach out to every resource you can. my dms are always open, i’m sending you so much love. you got this"	Capable-Peak-6156	reply	na	na	na	0.9989725351333618	no	no	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.

Oh my goodness. I had pretty similar situation happen to me when I was 15. It took a lot of time to understand that I was indeed oblivious and didn’t say yes to any of that or more of, didn’t say no either. I was numb and I just did as I was told. So, after awhile I got to the point of forgiving myself for not protecting me and not “knowing better”, which I actually did, but did not know how to apply it in given situation. Yes, I still feel ashamed, although every therapist I’ve ever visited claimed it was a SA. It’ll take time to heal and in the meantime be careful and thoughtful of your future actions for your own sake and I’m guessing you do have a parent who you can call anytime and, although it might not seem like it, gives more fucks about your safety than the situation you’re in.

">Your brain analyzed the situation and chose what it deemed the best way to keep you alive.

This is exactly it - with very little time to react and the brain basically multi-tasking with an overwhelming situation, it defaulted to base survival instinct, which involves deeply ingrained behaviors you see all throughout the ""animal kingdom"" at large.

Also as a guy who's not even really ripped and just mostly does aerobic exercise enough to stay in shape - I know I can lift a lot more than women my size, and I believe on average, men are like twice as strong as women, so even if this wasn't particularly large man, it can be super intimidating, but if he was a pretty huge guy that lifts or whatever, was likely vastly stronger.

So, it's definitely, absolutely not your fault OP and my heart breaks for you that you went through this and are down on yourself at all for your reaction in the moment.

"My close relative had a full blown SA happen literally outside of a bar. My relative had been working on EMDR with her therapist for agoraphobia caused in part by previous SA when she was younger. 

She finally got up the courage to go out- she rode her bike to the small town bar just a couple blocks from her house. There was a bit creepy guy watching her - she had a feeling the dude was a creep and told some of the other men in the bar about him and to keep an eye on him. 

She went outside to smoke and he followed her pushed her into the bushes and demanded she undress-‘the rest I can’t say but it was extremely violent and during the whole thing my relative was screaming and crying but also saying “it’s okay!” To the bar patrons who had come out and seen it happening. They tried to get him off her…it wasn’t until the cops came it took two officers to pull him off of her. My relative promptly got on her bike and said “it’s okay! It’s okay! I’m fine!”

Why would she say that? After what just happened? Because she was filled with Shame, embarrassment having been in that situation with strangers watching her, she just wanted to get relief she wanted it to not be happening. Well a female officer followed her home and collected her clothes for evidence and took her to the hospital where they had to do the most awful invasive exam apparently.

This man spent one night in jail. He got to go to court via zoom with his chest hair sticking out and th e same necklace he wore that night so my relative had to see that shit…

He had a wife and kids… but has warrants in 6 other states one for strangulation. It was obvious he was escalating but nope they put a bail of 50k which is NOTHING…

So because of this NEW SA my relative had to stop going to EMDR therapy because it works SO well that it might impact the way she’s perceived on the stand if she doesn’t seem super emotional about it. She never ended up taking the stand. It was very hard for me and my family. They do what they always do and drug it out as long as possible. That man got out of this by getting to go home, and get an ankle monitor, has to register as a Sex offender now, and if he fucks up even once it’s prison time. He will too which is awful and unfair to his future victim.

My realities SA case was rare: they had physical evidence, they had CCTV, they had other forensics, they had 5 Witnesses willing to testify, and 2 law enforcement officers.

It was a slam dunk case for 1st degree but somehow this guy took a fucking plea and got off easy like they *almost always* do.

The reason I shared this is two fold, the first reason is the need for justice reform in general but also it’s SO easy to make this better. Make stiffer laws for these abhorrent people.
   
The other is to illustrate something I noticed with SA victims, unfortunately literally every one of my female friends has had it happen. And they all talk almost relaxed about it because it’s nearly a “normal” thing, almost like just something woman have to go through. Which is SO SO SO fucked up for me to say it like that but it’s true! It’s so prolific and it blows my mind we as a society just like to pretend it doesn’t happen? 

Or the famous “she was asking for it” NO NO NO NO… no one asks to be taken advantage of and have literally the worst thing you can do to someone short of killing them. 

Woman should be able to wear whatever they want, do whatever they want, go wherever they want with whoever they want and not fear for their safety. 

However that’s not the world we live in.


If men had to deal with the issue of other men SAing them we’d have stiffer laws and guys wouldn’t say shit like this. It literally makes me *ashamed* to be a man…

A couple other random tips:

Make sure you have someone on speedial you can call. Or have them available to call you if you send a specific emoji or something and a prefabricated “out” like “oh shit me landlord is calling me that’s weird…” omg i gotta go! My apartment is flooding! 

Also never get yourself into a car, go with them alone anywhere, or leave your drink unattended when you go to the bathroom.(I know you’re too young to go to the bar yet but for the future)

Self defense: you can buy keychain tazers/pepper spray

I’d you’re ever in a situation where you’re being assaulted and it’s life or death, thumbs to the eyes, grabbing and ripping or any amount of damage to the balls will be effective.


I’m sure woman on here will have much better tips for you. Your story really struck a chord with me so that’s why I had to write so much.

Anyway I’m sorry this was all over the place but again I hope soemthing in here helped. And I’m sorry it was so crass but sometimes you have to be blunt.

I hope you learn and grow from this experience :)

You don’t ever ever ever have to do anything a guy tells you to do. Practice setting boundaries. Again I want to commend you for being so proactive in dealing with this by reaching out.

I would be crushed in your position so just realize how tough you are. You survived and you’re going to thrive! 

You go this! :)

Fight could get her beaten or killed

"Anything but a yes or clear consent is to be considered as a no. Reluctance is a no. Hesitance is a no. ""I don't know"" is a no. ""I'm not ready"" is a no. ""I'm not in the mood"" is a no. ""I'm not feeling it"" is a no. Not reacting at all is also a no. Anything but a clear fucking yes, is to be considered as a no.

There is NO implied consent and consent that you have forced someone to give you is not really consent.

You can say no or take back consent at any given point but when you're on someone else's car on an isolated hill, your first instinct isn't always to do that. 

OP is very clearly a victim here and the fact that he blocked her after he raped her is incredibly telling. He knows what he did.

This post is heartbreaking. I am so, so sorry this happened to you. Absolutely not your fault. You were explicit about you boundaries and comfort regarding physical touch before even meeting for the drive. You did nothing wrong. This person is a disgusting manipulative abuser who almost certainly has done this before. I am so so sorry you experienced this. I know it feels hard not to, but please do not blame yourself. 

Especially since you say you have said you don't really have friends or close family members you can trust to talk about this, please do what you can to find support through a therapist or counseling. 
As someone else replied to this comment, a rape/ crisis centre in your area would be an excellent resource. This is almost certainly the best place to start. Or if there is a sexual health centre, perhaps they can direct you somewhere? 

If you have a family member who would support you in therapy/ counselling, if financially it is an obstacle, hopefully you wouldn't have to tell them exactly what it was about? 

I went through situations such as this when I was your age, and if there was something I could go back and change, it would have been getting support for processing such events sooner rather than later. I am in my mid thirties now, and just finally have hope of getting an opportunity to process some of these incidents. They definitely have left a mark, and I believe the sooner one can get adequate and compassionate support in processing an event like this, the sooner a person can heal and learn to not internalize the blame and shame that inevitably comes up. 

The person who did his to you is the one who did wrong, who fucked up, and *should* feel  like a monster. You did right, you are young and you were clear and explicit about your boundaries and what your weren't ok with (which can be hard at any age for many people! So awesome that you were able to be clear about that!). One of the many ways these types of experiences can cause long term effects is they way they damage a person's ability to trust.  

Please do whatever you can to find a therapist counselor to help you navigate your recovery and healing from this event.

Kick, scream, get out of the car, call police, pepper spray him, shoot him.   Or at least CLEARLY tell him not.Stop!!.  99.99 percent of men fear raping a woman.

"Ah thank you for adding this! Yeah I think that is part of the issue is it must be (I don’t have children) strange to be teaching your kids this stuff. But I think the importance of the lesson >awkward conversation. 

I bought my ex gfs and my sister tazers and pepper spray. They are pretty cheap. But I’d always quiz my ex like “okay I’m going to try and pick you up and carry you to my car now what are you going to do…” and she’d always have the tazer or pepper spray buried or in some cumbersome place. And there’s no way she’d be able to get it if someone was being forceful and fast.


So after awhile she got good at drawing it and stuff and I felt comfortable she’d be able to handle herself. she used the bus a lot at the time and if you’ve ever used public transportation…

So I think you illustrate a good point too that there’s SO much more to teach and to learn to prevent the situation from occurring the first place. Preemptive behaviors that can help mitigate the creation of an environment where such a thing can transpire.

I didn’t even think about the *reason* for the eyes haha I just know it’s one of the most sensitive areas and would definitely immobilize most people i didn’t think of the fact they wouldn’t be able to see which seems obvious. Probably cause I’m a dude who is lucky he doesn’t have to even consider this stuff. 

But then you look at things like what happened to my relative and she never thought in a million years going to the bar down the block would result in that obviously.

That all being said it seems weird to *normalize* this
Safety but it’s not going away, and i hate to say this but it seems like it’s even more rampant than ever now. With online dating being an ingredient sometimes.

Anyway thanks for the input so others and OP can read. I think you’re a good mother for instilling those lessons and letting them know there *are* very bad people who wish you harm out there. Which is just awful to have to say I can’t imagine saying that kind of stuff to my child but it’s better that they know reality. 

I feel the alternative of ignoring it and not teaching/talking about this stuff because “oh it won’t happen to me or my child” actually helps to perpetuate the environment and possibility for these crimes to occur in the first place with the shame. guilt, and embarrassment that surrounds this topic.

It sounds awful to say but this sort of safety NEEDS to be normalized and shit I think they should teach it in school! It can be part of sex ed, and while your at it, teach the boys what’s appropriate and teach what is consent."

Unless you've been on the side of the woman, don't speak on it. She made it clear she wasn't interested in sex, she felt pushed into it. She doesn't need to scream and fight him off for it to be rape.

No, you clearly aren't.

A lot of women freeze up and can't react.. because they are worried about something worse happening. We all hear the stories about women being raped and killed, or just killed.. and in that moment sometimes after you've already said no, pulled away, said you didn't want to do this etc. and he keeps going?? What else do you do? You say jump up and scream at him to back off. OK now what? You're in the middle of the forest stranded with this man.

I’ve noticed recently that I can’t seem to continue conversations past the shallow state anymore and it’s quite debilitating because as someone that suffers with social anxiety I already overthink half the interactions that I encounter and to have the additional hit that people think I’m just socially inept because I can’t continue a conversation kills me inside. I wouldn’t say that it’s because I’m unable to voice my opinions, rather, I’ve chalked it up to the fact that my brain just can’t come up with responses fast which is why I just give the most npc answers in the moment and ponder over it in bed at 3am with possible answers that would have been so much better in the moment. I’ve always been a person that listens rather than rants lol I know it’s ironic considering this is a rant post, but I’m always open to hearing others out about their problems, but I find that I can’t provide advice or solutions because I’m just stunted in the moment. I know it’s not my place to have to provide these things and that my friends tell me because they just want the company and listening ear but I just wish I could do more for them when I see them struggling. Not only that, but I feel like I really do lack an opinion in so many matters which is why in group conversations where there’s back and forth, I’m always the person that says the least because I don’t have much to say.

"Here's another perspective: It's fine to not have an opinion about something. It's fine to have an opinion about something and not share it.

If you get put on the spot by someone asking you an opinion, you can just say something like: this (topic/question) is really interesting and I haven't thought about it before, I think I would need some time to think about it properly before forming an opinion.

"I've been in a similar place. I was absolutely numb except for the dull creeping sadness in the background. It's gotten me fired from a few jobs, even. Took me a long time to learn that my dull, low paying, dead end jobs were a catalyst for depression for me. 

It may be worth doing some thinking to find what your catalyst is, and if there's something you yourself can do to remedy it. There's nothing more powerful for depression than being able to get yourself out of it. Sometimes we need help to do that though. Being fired is the only thing that used to get me out of the slump, because I had no other choice than to find something new. A new job for me has always been invigorating. These days, I know the signs and start looking for something new if these feelings start creeping up. Now, I'm in the works for something of my own that I have control over.

"Sorry to hear that, I feel you!
It sounds to me like you could be depressed, in which case you would have a chemical imbalance in your brain, causing you to feel this way. 
There are many remedies for this, the most common beeing medication, spending time in nature, therapy, exercise. All these things help you re-wire your brain to start balancing your dopamine releases, which is basically what decides if you are happy or sad. 

The brain is by professionals often likened to a forrest. The more you walk a path/trail in the forrest, the easier it becomes to walk that same path again. So if you have a lot of negative thoughts, the brain will automatically lean towards having those type of thoughts again.

I recommend you start with small bouts of excersise, combined with cold showers (YouTube; Andrew huberman cold shower).
This will increase your dopamine levels by hundreds of %. Works well for me.

Or even better, seek help from a professional!
They will most likely set you down this path also.
I personally do not like anti-depressants but if your brain is severely depressed you will probably need them to reset. Make sure you thread carefully and wean off them slowly when the time comes. I read that suicide risk goes up several hundred % when getting off anti-depressants so make sure you have a safety net and talk it through with your doctor carefully before you do this.

The only natural remedy for severe cases of depression I have heard of is magic mushrooms, but I am not well informed in this area. Might be worth looking into though.

I hope you get better and know that many people who get out of depression are very thankful for doing so and live happy full lives.
There is still very much hope for you yet!
Stay strong!

Edit; I remember reading about an American study a few years ago which concluded that 93% of people suffering depression had a severe Magnesium deficiency.
So you might want to do some blood work to see if you have any deficiencies, this might contribute or perhaps even cause your depression."	Uh_OhItzMe	reply	na	na	na	0.9988570213317871	strong	no	no	na	offmychest	failed

"I have been on dating sites here and there and a consistent theme is the fish pics. Guys and their biggest catch.

There are a few reasons I dont want to do this:
1. I dont want to accidentally get a guys hopes up or hurt anyone
2. I am in a relationship and unless I set everything up and do this with him, I can see a misunderstanding happening

Apprenticeships aren't what they used to be. Originally they trained you from the ground up, with less pay. As you acquire skills and experience the pay went up. I say this from experience and how those apprenticeships don't really exist any more. I tried to enter a field that quote unquote had apprenticeships.

I went part time at my full time job back in May. I got another part time job in addition to it, and I’ve been much happier. But financially we’ve been struggling. I had $1 left after bills drafted out of my paycheck last week, I was living off of my $55 tips check, and had to borrow gas money from 2 separate people. We’ve been living off of butter noodles for the last week. We haven’t been able to enjoy anything because my boyfriend has been paying all of our rent on his own. (I promise this is about to be positive, stay with me for a little longer.) I took a major leap of faith and applied for a full time position with MAJOR benefits. 401K, medical, dental, vision, and even life insurance included. I interviewed last Tuesday and he told me I was up against 11 other people (no pressure, right?) I got a call today with the area code of the corporate office. I answered and was simply waiting for the “we regret to inform you…” and was instead met with a “we’d like to offer you the position…”. Idk. I think that’s what she said? Everything just became a blur. I had to mute myself so that the recruiter on the other line wouldn’t hear me sobbing. I could barely grasp what she was saying because I was crying so hard. I’m going to be making $6 more an hour than what I was making at my full time job before. I’m still just in shock and trying to process it all.

I have worked in my restaurant for almost 3 years. I try to be nice, I treat everyone with respect, I cover shifts, I am never late and never call out. I was waiting up by the expo (we have a open kitchen) and one of the line cooks complimented my hair. I enthusiastically said “thank you!” Because I really do appreciate when someone notices I do something different. He smiled and as I went to walk off, I overheard him say to the other cook “I don’t get why everyone hates her, I think she’s sweet”. I acted like I didn’t hear it. I know it shouldn’t effect me, but I don’t have many friends. I love my job and I love everyone I work with. I don’t think I’ve ever done anything to anyone there. It just hurts, but hey at least the cooks like me! You win some, you lose some.	Socktrauma77	post	29.27135534092124	female	White	0.003370050573721528	na	na	na	52	offmychest	no prediction.

"When I was hired at my current job, my boss interviewed me in tandem with a girl, I'll call her ""Lisa."" We were both hired on the spot and started at the same time.
Lisa was incredibly sweet, had plenty of serving experience, was an excellent server, and a good worker. Never shirked her duties, never complained about anything, just an all around excellent co-worker (plus she had Helen Hunt's exact voice, which I loved, lol).
From day one, all of the girls at that job treated her like shit. I mean, they were downright cruel to her. They just hated her at first sight. She came into the job excited, trying to make friends, and by week 2 she was a broken person, often in tears by the time she left for the day. And at the end of week 2 she quit.
I never have understood it. How they very deliberately drove away someone who was so nice, and was a definite asset as a co-worker. It was so sad. The only thing I can think of is that they felt threatened by her.

"Exactly why I left my previous role after 15 years. They were cliquey because 2 of us went to HR about them earning more than us when they first started for doing the same job we'd been doing for 8 years (we're talking two steps up the payscale from where we were). We were just given a payrise. Their pay wasn't affected at all, but it put a target on my back. 

If one of them hadn't blabbed about their salary, we might never have known (not that I'm against discussing salary at all)

After my other colleague left, I was the only 'original' still on the team everyone else was in the clique. I got all the shit jobs, the worst clients, and the most work. I was never covered if I wasn't there, and if I asked for help, no one bothered. EVERY absence I had, including booked holidays, were viewed with scepticism (my manager was formerly part of the clique). I was hardly ever off. Once my wife was rushed to hospital in the night, I still went to work despite only having about two hours sleep, they decided to joke about me actually being out on the piss. If I was sick, I was treated like I was faking. 

I covered for anyone who asked if they were off, I was nice to everyone, and I helped out where I could if needed. When I was recognised for my long service and was given rewards for helping others in the company, my manager never bothered giving them to me until weeks after he'd just say ""oh yeah you got this"" everyone else got a little speech and stuff.I never had a performance review or anything. Plus they forgot my birthday (funnily enough everyone else was remembered) and would arrange nights out etc without me. It just got really intense. I remained professional, but it was horrible 

Also, we were supposed to rotate around who had time off over Christmas. We got Christmas day and boxing day off, but any other time had to be taken as leave. Mine was always refused every year. 

In the end, I was the only one of the oldies left. I had 16 clients I was dealing with, and everyone else had at most 4. Mh workload was getting more and more intense if I asked for help no one had any time or I'd be sarcastically told ""you've been here long enough you should be able to handle it"" when I physically had 4 times the workload.

"I (22M) graduated 2 years ago and got a high salary, high stress job where I worked for 18 months. I left that place burnt out and jaded but at least I managed to save some money. Now why is saving money important for me, right now? Because I was raised poor, with an abusive father, and saw my mother fight day and night to provide so what I want to do is save enough to put down a down payment (around 20%) for the house. I will need to do this sooner rather than later because I am hoping to go back to academia, where I belong, within the next 3 years to pursue a PhD. Until then, I will need to keep working these IT jobs that pay well but feel soulless and I'm breaking down. I can't find the motivation to do my work well, I sometimes just feel like screaming to conceal the general numbness I usually feel. 

I want to go traveling before my PhD and allow myself to live a life without any responsibilities on my shoulders, even if it's only for a year. But I can't. I gotta power through and I'm tired.

"It can be really hard to work in a job you don’t like. Especially a high stress job. I am currently working for the DOT doing something other than what I studied for because I looked at the private sector and decided that the extra money was not worth the extra stress. My advice is put out your feelers and see what other options you have. Sometimes it is worth it to take a bit of a pay cut in order to do something that isn’t a pain. 

I am also personally am not sure that getting a phd is the answer, generally higher degrees means more responsibility which means more stress. But if you know what you want to do with it and that you enjoy doing that then go for it. 

Ok I am going to tell you this, you don’t need a 20% down payment. Yes it is nice to have but it is generally not worth delaying putting in an offer to save for the 20% for the following reasons. 
1. All you are avoiding with the 20% is mandatory mortgage insurance, which which although is annoying and an extra ~$50 a month on your payment it is really not worth delaying over. Also that mortgage insurance is automatically dropped after you have paid 20% back so it isn’t even something you have to pay for the whole loan. 
2. Houses increase in value. On average the cost of housing in the US is increasing by 3% each year. So if you are looking at a $200,000 house you are going to need $40,000 for your 20% down payment let’s say that will take you 2 years to save, in that time the house will have increased in value to $212,100 and you will need an extra $2,200 for your down payment. 

Also be sure to look into first time home buyers grants and deals your mortgage provider should be able to give you more details on these."	Honest-Trifle8254	reply	na	na	na	0.9981735944747925	weak	strong	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.
"So I've been attracted to feminine men for some while now, but I've only met one who liked girls? But that's not the only reason I've been trans-questioning. See I live with 3 brothers and a ""manly"" or ""dominant"" father. (It feels weird calling my dad dominant but it's true.) I act a lot like my father since he taught me basically everything I knew while still working two jobs. I had a typical household, a mother cleaning and cooking, taking care of the kids, while the dad was the moneymaker. Growing up, my brothers played football while I did cheerleading, I always went to their practices but I never really watched the game. I just wanted to be out there, running as fast as I could, hitting people for fun and getting sweaty and messy. I was never really friends with a lot of girls except those who played sports. As I grew up, around 13 years old, I started playing softball, which felt so right to me, I still play it in high school. But one day I came home and the house was empty, my mother was out at a job interview, and my brothers were at practice. I snuck into my oldest brothers room and dug through his closet to try on his clothes. I but on his basketball shorts and tried on more of his clothes until I took one of his plain black shirts and a pair of shorts. I still wore dresses and stuff, but only on special occasions, I generally saw myself staring at pretty girls and I've cried myself to sleep multiple times because I wasn't male, and mainly because girls I liked never liked me. I've had about 2 girlfriends before. I'm in a religious family and I wanted to be religious because it made me happy when I lived by the simple rules. But I also wanted to be with a woman, and I didn't even want to be a woman. My father treated me like a girl, when I wanted him to treat me like my brothers, he always held the door but never let me hold the door for him, I grew up thinking that everybody could do that and it was just common decency, but when I wanted to wear a suit so I could be Jack Skellington for Halloween, he said ""girls can't wear suits."" It clearly made me upset because when I didn't fit my fathers views of what a girl was, I never felt like a girl. I still don't really feel like a girl, I just wanted the people that I was attracted to, to be attracted to me. I just wanted to feel comfortable in my own skin. Sometimes I like being a girl, but then when I'm catching myself looking at another girl, or a femboy, I remember that they probably won't like me. I'm so confused and it's stressful. I can't even decide, I just want to be what I truly am and what makes me happy."	tireddmf	post	13.701537091199883	male	White	0.009098879061639309	na	na	na	3	offmychest	no prediction.

"TW sexual assault 

As it says really. 3 weeks ago I (26F) was on holiday by myself, staying in an air BnB that had different rooms that could be rented out. i specifically booked this place because as I was by myself. I wanted my own room and keys etc but did not want to just be in a lonely hotel room. I’ve travelled a lot before, so am used to a communal hostel way but just wanted something a little nicer for this trip. 

I got spiked and assaulted on the last night of my trip by a 40something year old man who was also staying at this airbnb. Those feelings to do with specifically that I’m “dealing” with - but what I’m most terrified about is that he will come and find me. Working it out from the last time I remember checking my phone and when I came to, I was unconscious for roughly 7hrs. 

My passport, my phone, my provisional drivers license, my purse, my house keys, everything was in my room and I’ve got this crippling fear that he’s going to turn up at my house. My ID has my home address on it and I’m just so scared he’s going to turn up and has made a copy of my keys, taken photos of them and sent them to his sick rapist friends, they can find my job my friends.. There’s literally nothing stopping him from copying all of my information, I’ve already gone to my bank and requested new cards, but I just can’t shake this fear. 

I already wasn’t sleeping well due to a different circumstance, but I can’t rest, I’m just so scared and I don’t know what to do. I moved back in with my mum and I’m just terrified I don’t know what to do"	tebbers1	post	24.00328814342286	female	White	0.9984323382377625	na	na	na	1	offmychest	failed
"This happened nearly a year ago now but I thought it would be good to finally get it off my chest to someone other then my therapist. 

My dog, age 14 was put down due to heart problems, it wasn’t uncommon for his breed but nonetheless it hurt me more then I could ever put into words I remember crying every day at least once until his death. He was euthanised on my lap at home I never felt more loved then I did in that moment, I grew up with him and his brother who is currently sleeping beside me as I write this I was 3 when we got him and he died when I was 17. He was a massive part of my family and I remember my entire family crying when he passed including my dad who isn’t by any means an emotional person but he loved that dog like another son whether he admits it or not but I’m getting off track. When he was put down I tried to stop my tears but I just couldn’t, I lost a major family member, a brother who I grew up with and loved. I know most people only see pets for that pets nothing then an accessory to them but to me they are so much more and always will be.

Later when the people who collected him to cremate we all went into our seperate rooms to cry and when I started crying my girlfriend at the time tried to comfort me at first which I appreciated but after awhile she got mad at me for crying so much and said to me. “I’m sorry but I can’t comfort you right now but if you ever told me that I would never forgive you.” And then she started crying so I had to suppress all the emotions so I could comfort her, I had to comfort her because I cried over my dog who died less the 2 hours ago! I don’t know why I did it I should’ve kicked her out, I should’ve broke up with her but no I comforted her because she couldn’t comfort me and after she fell asleep that night I cried to myself down stairs.

A month or so later she said to me in front of her parents i over reacted to my dogs death and I shouldn’t of cried, in that moment I was shocked and angry but also sad because I thought she would’ve understood as she had a cat which I brought up to her but she said. “I would be sad for the first week but I would get over it.” Without a hint of sadness in her voice and that conversation ended there. I remember that car ride being dead quiet after that.

As you could probably gather from this I’m a big animal lover and I’m emotional by guy standards but I try to keep my emotions inside where I can but tonight I guess I had to make this post as a way to get out my emotions so thank you for reading I do really appreciate it.

TLDR: ex cried because I was crying to much so I comforted her then she later told me I over reacted to my dogs death."	Backflipdestroysign	post	18.631541607347927	female	White	0.011658107861876488	na	na	na	1	offmychest	failed

It got better throughout the years but a few months ago all the online shopping just started again. I online shopped 4 times this week and I’m spending way too much money I’m seriously going broke. But even going broke doesn’t stop me. It’s like spending just fulfils something in my brain and it makes me feel good but when I check my bank account… I know it’s all self control but “I just can’t”.

"I've been in the same situation as you. Understand that the world works in a way that is outside of your control. There are people who worked the same job as you who own houses and blame \*you\* for your despair. This creates a culture that forces you deeper into addiction. People your age who own their own homes got there through existing generational wealth or luck. I had neither. I had to do two things; work towards a career and be okay with not achieving the ""expected outcome"".  


There are things you can do about it on an individual level. Americorps saved my life. Instead of struggling to pay college bills and to find a job, I have experience on my resume and have half my uni paid for. If you're American, sign up for this. Your parents will be proud of you for your service and for working towards college credit (you get up to 14k or something like that, more if you're in California). I work in education now, and I'm working towards my masters in psychology so I can be a school psychologist. A year ago I was drinking a fifth of whiskey a day just to sleep, and had no motivation to pursue a career.   


Find your passion through university. If you can't, that means you don't need it. Try trade school or develop a talent for your business. Find a way to be independent, but the mindset of ""I need a house and a family"" is toxic. I still live with my parents, but I have a plan to move out. Nothing wrong with living with your parents either by the way, they're just very strict and I have a libertine attitude towards life.  


Good luck dude. Have a tight virtual hug, and know it's \*never\* hopeless."	midnightmontage	reply	na	na	na	0.9977020621299744	weak	strong	no	na	offmychest	failed
i (24f) haven’t self harmed by cutting in many years. at least 6 or 7 i think. i have undiagnosed mental illness, after a lot of my own research i think it most closely resembles cptsd or bpd. recently i’ve been thinking of self harming a lot. i haven’t done it and i don’t plan to i just wanted to say something about thinking it. if i tell my partner i think he will be extremely sad about it and i don’t want to hurt him and he’s also not equipped to handle things like that. i’ve just been dealing with a lot of bad thoughts about myself and other people. tons of disassociating. flashbacks to trauma. i don’t really want to tell anyone or make it a big deal because i don’t plan on actually cutting myself i just kinda fantasize about the release a lot. it feels like i’m under so much pressure and nothing is enough to release it. i work out, i write in a journal, i take time to clear my head but it’s not enough to stop feeling like i’m one bad day away from exploding. i’m not really looking for sympathy or anything. just hoping this will release the pressure. i know a lot of people think self harmers are weak, but honestly it’s like an addiction. and having the strength to keep away from it is so hard.	irl-toothfairy	post	23.986376583367626	female	White	0.008799834176898003	na	na	na	1	offmychest	failed
"Hey, your feelings are valid, you’re not weak or a bad person for feeling the way you do. If anything you are stronger for being able to carry on without hurting yourself. 

However, i do think you should have an honest conversation with your SO and tell him how you’re feeling. Any problem shared is a problem halved and i really think the support could be helpful. You can tackle it together.

Alternatively look for therapy if you’re not already getting therapy. Theres no shame in going, people go for many reasons not just trauma or self harm, so nobody is going to know why youre going if youre worried about that.

"Hi, I  (19F) is currently trying to be happy from a recent LDR breakup. So some backstory, I met my bf (23) on omegle back in 2022. We hit it off right away and we made it official after a week since we told each other that we were really in love with one another. We were happy for the first few months, but then after my birthday on August, he suddenly disappeared. I spammed him, basically begging him to come back and even though I knew I didn't do anything wrong, I took blame for why he left and felt guilty for the 3 months that he was gone.

He came back after 3 months and told me that his house situation got fucked up and he ended up fucking his sister's fwb, who is 14. I cursed him for a few hours but eventually we talked it out and I forgave him, but it was never the same. He kept disappearing and just talking enough with me to make me beg to let him stay with me. 

Now he disappeared again for 2 months, then he suddenly emailed me hoping I was okay. Then the first 2 emails I replied are basically me begging him to talk but idk why but something in me snapped. I typed a lengthy message basically telling him how he broke me and how a disgusting manipulator he is and to never contact me again.  


Its been a week since that email. I'm now moved on and I'm trying to heal myself but I still check if he has reached out to me. I know I'll never go back to him but I don't know why I keep expecting him to come back. I'm just so confused. Any type of advice will be helpful, I just feel like this feeling is preventing me from fully moving on."

As for moving on, the only thing that works is time. it sucks in the moment, but you'll look back in a couple months and not hurt as much.

"The euphoric high you feel when you fall in love is amazing. There's no feeling like it. You heart races. Adrenaline gives you the ""butterflies in the stomach"" sensation. And because it feels so outrageously good, you overlook the bad things. Or you make excuses for them. Or you allow yourself to be convinced that those bad things aren't a big deal.

But people who are putting on an act to impress another human being cannot, under any circumstances, maintain that façade. Their true nature starts to bleed through their disguise, and that's when you sink into emotional turmoil.

My last relationship, ended some four and a half years ago, turned out to be a very special nightmare. Because I told her up front that big lies were unacceptable. Little lies to save someone's feelings and small omissions were okay. But telling me a lie so large that it can't possibly remain hidden would result in an end to the relationship.

Famous last words.

She turned out to be lazy, a financial leech, and, you guessed it, a liar. And for the longest time, I overlooked the lie because so much of what we had was good. ***WAS.*** It took some time, but I eventually realized that I'd lowered my standards for her. I made excuses for her. When I reaffirmed my standards, I immediately put a plan into action that would put 1,000 miles between me and her.

This is what you need to do. Establish your boundaries and stick with them. This LDR guy sounds like a creep. He had sex with a 14-year-old?!? Girl, red flags aren't made any bigger or brighter! You should have started running when you found that out.

Alas, you're young. (I'm old enough to be your father.) You need to learn from experience, and that means going through a lot of pain to gain wisdom. Put this guy in your rearview mirror and keep him there. Make this a lesson from which you can take something away. Realize that he wasn't the great love you thought he was or pretended to be. Lock your gaze on the path *IN FRONT OF YOU* and stay on it. There are bigger and better romances out there for you. And at 19, you've only just begun your journey into loving and being loved.

"Siblings constantly disrespect me

I (29M), youngest of my 3 siblings, changed my name a while ago, my oldest brother(33M) who has always talked down to me, despite numerous achievements I’ve made in my life, far more than he ever has done. 

He called me, I told him of said name change, he basically starts ridiculing me, laughing at me, saying he’s never going to call me by new name, and he doesn’t care.

I decide to hang up on him, I’ve had distance from my siblings and they didn’t witness the changes I went through over time. 

I have a very lucrative career, more successful than any of my siblings, a stable, happy relationship filled with love, not to mention I lend money out to them all the time. Which I shouldn’t, I know, I’m scaling back on that. 

It’s an unspoken assumption among everyone that once our mother passes, I will become the family patriarch.

I’m already being passed down everything, the house, all the land, possessions, etc. As our parents believe they are far too irresponsible to handle any of it.
(My siblings don’t know this yet)

Yet I’m ridiculed. I guess I’m just venting.

I don't think about her often but every now and then someone would mention her and I'd get war flashbacks again then I'd feel like I wanna punch a tree or something. Why did I even love that girl who was cheating on me with two different guys the whole time we were together.

I hate how she destroyed my self esteem and confidence. I hate how she gaslit me until the very end. I hate her friends and family who knew about her cheating but tolerated it and actively hid it from me. Fuck all them lies.

I hope karma gets her. Her and her new deadbeat boyfriend both. Fucking pathetic loser went into a relationship with someone he knew was cheating on me with him and another dude. I hate how they probably laugh at me for being so oblivious and gullible. Funny joke fuckers."

"I can’t stand my bfs new female friend Olive (not real name). 
Little bit of background, I’m 13 weeks pregnant and when my bf and I found out our relationship became a bit rocky because he was on and off about wanting the baby. So we took a break and during that break he met Olive, and they got along great which I was happy with because my bf is very antisocial and doesn’t have that many friends. 

When we got back together however I noticed things on his phone, like Olive had a red heart next to her name. I confronted him about it and he said “oh I just told her to put her number in my phone and she added that heart.” I asked him if he could AT LEAST remove it and he continued to say “I’ll do it later.”

And last night at stupid o’clock he was getting calls from Olive which he ignored but it really ticked me off that she was calling him so late, that’s when I also found out she had asked MY BF out days prior of us getting back together, again this didn’t sit well with me so I asked him to remove her completely and he dismissed it. 

This morning he got a call from Olive saying “Oh why didn’t you answer my calls I was worried?” and I got more angry. I’m tempted to just message her myself and tell her to stop talking to him because she’s making me very uncomfortable."

"Like %90 percent of all Gym bros, I was inducted into fitness against my will by the power of forbidden pre. I didn’t do it for any noble reason like mental health, physical health, or longevity. I did it solely for 1 reason. 

To make her regret. 

That being said, we all start somewhere and this sadly, is just how I started. In the beginning it was all about the esthetics. I’ve never looked good in my life; I’ve never once looked in the mirror and was happy with what I saw. So as far as adolescent traumas went, that was the reason for ALL of the failures of my life.

I had social anxiety…. because I was unattractive.

I couldn’t physically do what I want…... because I was fat.

I couldn’t find emotional connection…. because I was a pig. 

And there it was, that was the sole reason for all the problems in my life. Of course, as a human being there was surely nothing I could do about it. I was meant to forever live my life absent of these privileges because of my predomination to accumulate body weight. Unlucky I was straight unlucky.

But FUCK it, we play with the cards we are dealt. I gain body weight ridiculously well. Not just fat but also muscle. I’m a bonehead who can tune out all logic and just do it. I’m intellectually gifted enough to latch on and learn anything I put my mind to. Along with all of the above, I was also an emotional wreck who can channel those same emotions into mental determination.
So, what does that make me? 

A Great Lifter.

I didn’t know it, but my physical body is actually incredible. I progressed every week, consistently increasing weight on every exercise. Deadlift, Squats, Bench, you name it, it was going on every week and before I knew it. I was a BEAST! I started noticing as people started staring. Their faces said it all…”405 on DL, must be a PR”, Only to drop jaws once I repped it for 10. “500 on squats, THAT’S UNREALLLL”, “That guy must be roided up to bejesus”, “WoW….”. And when I heard the words actually come out of their mouths, it triggered an emotion like no other. My whole life, admiring the idols of Asian culture, I hated my body. But due to this small cultural sphere, I could like myself, and for once I had what everyone in the room wanted. It was a surreal feeling. 

I had initially started this ALL for the esthetics…. all for revenge, but it has since become something far more than that. The depression has not fully disappeared, and at this point, I’m pretty sure it never will, but pumping iron fights it to a standstill incredibly well. I’m able to do things with my body that I never thought possible, even in my wildest imaginations. All my life I had hated my body, it was a curse, but by doing something as simple as changing my perspective it so easily became my best asset. The most important thing though, really…Is that on occasion when I look in the mirror, I can like who I am, physically, mentally, and all in between…I was never able to do that before."	blinkyang	post	18.02797037164732	male	White	0.0031480526085942984	na	na	na	1	offmychest	failed
"Back in February, my newlywed wife went away for a week to see her family and friends, which we had moved across the country from for her fellowship. I didn’t come with her as I was saving my PTO to cash out to help fund our next move (which would have been last month), and I also needed some dental work done and couldn’t delay it anymore.

While she was staying with her family, she called me. I could sense something off in her voice, so I asked her what was wrong. She told me how unhappy and alone she has felt since we had moved. She said I felt more like a roommate, and that I had ruined her fellowship for her because I didn’t care for the area we were living in (very high COL). I felt incredibly guilty hearing this. We had only been married 5 months (together for 6+ years total, and living with each other for 4.5 years), and she was already suggesting marriage counseling. I didn’t protest.

I was eager to work things out, as I adored and loved her very much. Over the next several weeks I was planning activities for us every weekend, on top of doing all the cooking and cleaning in the apartment (I had always done this though). We had our first marriage counseling session and my wife said she feared that maybe we were just too different or incompatible. Hearing this felt like a gut punch; where was this concern prior to moving and getting married?

Then came March 31st and April 1st, we went out on the former for a long walk after work and some drinks. She told me she was feeling better about things, and I felt a huge sigh of relief. The next day we went out for breakfast, then spent the rest of the day car shopping until he found something we liked. After that I took her out to a very nice restaurant for dinner, from there we went to the hot tub and had some passionate sex. I felt like we starting to get out of the valley.

April 2nd…I’ll never forget this day. I woke up early, and despite the last few days seemingly going well I still didn’t feel like things were quite right. When my wife had told me 2 months prior she was unhappy, I confided this to my mother. My mothers first comment to me was “there might be someone in her office”. I didn’t want to believe that, but it was always in the back of my head. I was up early as I mentioned, and my curiosity got the best of me so I checked her phone.

Sure enough, there was someone in the office. Someone she was texting minutes after we had sex. Someone she had been sending nudes to, meeting up with, and planning future dates with. I was crushed, but then I exploded. For the last several weeks I had been beaten down thinking I was the cause of relationship falling apart, only to find out her affair began coincidentally a few days before I received her phone from her parents house.

I woke her up and asked her “what the fuck is this?” At that point, I just needed to unload. I called her every name in the book to break her down and to hurt her. I then called her affair partner, but he didn’t pick up, so I left him some threatening messages about beating him up, and exposing them in the office…he was a subordinate of hers, and engaged himself. Maybe his fiancé would like to know?

At that point, I felt I just needed to leave. I told her she needs to figure out what she wants, because she crossed the line. I went back home, but before I did she asked me to continue counseling remotely so we could repair things. I still foolishly loved her and agreed. Over the next several weeks in counseling, it became evident that she wasn’t taking any accountability. She harped on the hateful things I said to her after my discovery, and how my threats to her affair partner made her view me as potentially violent, and this made her afraid of me. This is despite me never laying a hand on anyone in my life; something she knew.

I wanted her to agree to an intensive marriage retreat weekend after her fellowship ended. As we’re discussing it, a coworker of hers texted me. Asking if I knew that my wife was cheating on me. It turns out the affair never stopped, and my separation allowed it to turn into a full blown relationship. Everyone in the office knew, but were hesitant to tell me. She was still parading around work, talking about me like I was still living with her and all was well. I obviously had already discovered it 2 months prior, but now I knew that I was just being strung along. For what? That’s I don’t know.

At that point, I had it. I took the evidence that I saved in April, and sent it to her HR department after calling them. I knew the email addresses of several of her coworkers and CC’d them. I sent the most salacious stuff her parents, siblings, best friends, mutual friends, and best off all…the HR department of her next employer. I let her file for divorce, as I knew that would be the end result of my revenge campaign, and it’s something I should have done in April anyway.

From what I’m told, she was terminated from her fellowship, and the job she was supposed to start this month. Apparently she’s also emotionally distraught due to me humiliating her to family and friends, as well as destroying her reputation in the short term. And you know what? It makes me so happy. I’m glad she’s been humiliated, and I only wish I could inflict more pain on her."

"I'm sorry you had to go through all of this.  I don't blame you for feeling good about messing up her life, but I will caution you to be careful.  The kind of emotional high you're enjoying right now can often lead to a sudden plummet to severe depression.

I'm not a psychologist, councilor or therapist, but I think what you may be doing right now is using the acts of revenge and the thrill of inflicting it to avoid feeling all of the negative stuff that comes along with betrayal and the end of your marriage.

Have a few numbers handy of people you can call if the bottom drops out from under you. If/when that happens the low may be even lower than this high feels high right now.

">she’s also emotionally distraught due to me humiliating her to family and friends and well as destroying her reputation. 

You did no such thing. She single handedly did all of that herself. “If someone telling the truth makes you look bad, the problem isn’t the person saying it, it’s your actions.”  Sure, you exposed the truth, but she is the only one responsible for any of it.  The way she was parading her affair around the office shows she has no remorse for it - she’s only mad she got caught. But yet she did nothing to prevent it. All of her colleagues knew. It was only a matter of time before someone outed her. 

I’m sorry you’re currently dealing with this but I hope you’re on the mend. It will take time, but you will get there. And hopefully you’ll find someone worthy of you - if you decide to get back into dating one day.  As for her, her misery is her own problem and she can blame you all she wants.

"Yes! Honestly, you would be surprised at how so many people are extremely reluctant to expose their cheating partner.. mostly because they’re still in love, and are mentally trying to rationalize things.

Heck, I even read a story a few months ago, where a guy literally found a video of his wife with another man and bent over backwards, explaining to her that she was taken advantage of .. she was even honest with him and it’s like he couldn’t accept that.

Good for you. Honestly, I’m flabbergasted that she would shit where she eats given her profession, it’s a pretty small community to be honest, and you rarely see doctors dating anyone even from the same healthcare system, let alone the same office. What was she thinking??

I don’t care how attractive someone is, you never make your fling, or even your relationship come from the place you work at .. there are so many far-reaching consequences that go beyond ruining your marriage.. and she got a taste of it.

"You say in the comment section that you wish to know what did you do to make her drift away. I don't know the relationship you had, but most of the time with cheaters, the cheated partner is not the issue.

I cheated on my long-time partner some years ago. I won't go into detail, but the affair lasted long and it was only possible cause we had a long-distance relationship. The more time passed, the more I felt the guilt and shame eating me inside. The less I could do is to tell him myself. He was flawed in many things like me as well, but any of those things made me do that horrible thing to him. It was a mixture of loneliness, miscommunication, depression, and a way to deflect my own demons. (and of course, being a shit person).

A year has passed, and I think I'll never be able to forgive myself for the pain I inflicted on him. I can only reflect on the damage I did, be honest with myself and others, and try to do better. For me and for my next partner.

Too many times these trifling women get away with their destructive behavior with no repercussions because the guy is too reluctant to expose their s/o . This was handled the way it should of been. Cheaters and liars deserve to sleep on the floor ,And not only for cheating but just being an all around evil person . To this day, it boggles my mind how someone can look you in your eyes, tell you that they love you but also blatantly Lie to you , all in the same breath . Some people lack empathy and that’s ok.

Why is everyone applauding this? Yeah the wife absolutely sucks, but revenge porn is generally considered the worse offense.

"I'm so happy you outed her. Not for the revenge for you (which has to be a nice feeling on its own), but the ""price to pay"" for her as a cheater. Cheating has hit epidemic levels and I personally believe a small part of the reason is there are rarely real consequences for the cheater. That's why cheaters always blame their partner and make silly, if not flat out false, reasons why THEM cheating isn't THEIR fault. To be perfectly clear, she didn't lose her fellowship, her job, and is humiliated to her friends and family because you outed her.....she lost all that because she lied, cheated, and maliciously blamed and manipulated her victim. She shouldn't get to walk away all willy nilly while you deal with the pieces of the life she broke. I feel cheating should be treated like the hostility that it is and should be vigorously confronted on all fronts until these lying sacks of shit start to realize you can't just leave a path of destruction in your wake and suffer no consequences.

You didn’t deserve any of the horrible things she did to you. There’s a concept in diplomacy called proportional response. You didn’t throw acid in her face, for example.

"This is so eerily close to what just recently happened to me. Was with my ex wife for 7 years and married almost two. 20-27, loved her with everything I had and always gave her the best of me. 
10 months into our marriage she went to her college roommates wedding in California and I didn’t go due to PTO and our dog. Not a big deal she was only gone Fri-Sun. She called me Saturday morning and I could feel something was up but I decided to brush it off and I thought to myself no way she would have done anything. When she got back on Sunday she immediately started talking about our relationship and saying things like did we get married to young, blah blah blah. Gaslighting me. Made me feel like I was causing issues in our marriage. The week goes by and she’s just acting weird and not herself. I asked multiple times if something happened and she kept denying it. Then the next week I was leaving for a friends bachelor party and the morning I was leaving admitted to me that she had cheated on me the first night she was in California with a random guy. I didn’t even know what to say, I was literally about to walk out the door to leave for the airport. And I did leave, wether this was the right decision or not I don’t care I was feeling so many emotions at the time I couldn’t be around her. I had to spend my best friends bachelor party a complete mess because of what she did. Looking back now I think she did it on purpose. Anyway I get back after a few days and we decide to go to therapy and try to move forward. After some months of therapy I’m starting to feel better and after a couple more months I decide it’s in the best interest of our relationship to start forgiving her. Fast forward 10 months after the cheating and out of nowhere she said that we have grown apart and I’m not the man she thought I would be, she’s been unhappy for five years and she wants a divorce. 5 years?! And you’re just telling me now? Bullshit 
I literally gave everything to this woman, cut off friends, cut off family, did what ever she wanted when ever she wanted and this is what I got. I mean she literally tried to off herself on my birthday one year and me being the bigger person stayed with her because I thought to myself “I can’t leave her because of mental problems that’s fucked up” 
She had just started a new job and both of my parents think there is someone at work and I believe it too. She’s a nurse and smokes weed regularly and I’ve wanted to call HR and let them know so bad but have yet to do it. It would ruin her whole career.

I've endured dozens of beatings over the course of my life without responding in kind, and it took me years to begin to see that as a strength rather than a source of shame. All that was undone with those false words of hers, which she demonstrably did not believe herself, and which I later learned from her sister was calculated to take me down. All so she could fuck around with some cokehead loser she met at a fleabag dive of a club in Adams Morgan.

Drifting away is one thing. Taking action in the way she did is another. Since she was willing to have a full blown affair, she likely has other insecurities and vacuous qualities that you never could have satiated.

That is a very long time to be with someone. She gives me compulsive liar vibes but from reading your story. You know what I got from it in regards to her...is that she is someone that is mentally ill. You know those people that play a lot of head games and they are not right in the head. She pushed you and pushed you until you reacted. I could literally read each part of the story and add a different analysis to each part. She won't confess, when her plan is to shift blame and switch it all on you. I'm sorry you had to go through this. The way you reacted was totally normal to be honest and the way she switched everything back on you and called you aggressive just shows how ill she is. She could be a psychopath or something like that. I'm not trained in those things but she really ain't right in the head. She could be jealous of you also. Just hope the divorce runs smoothly and you can hurry and get her out of your life and get your happiness back. She's a waste of time and didn't deserve all your kindness and time. She could be immature as well. If you were to know her from childhood/teenaged years- I bet you would have seen there is a screw missing. She definitely isn't right in the head.

"It's tongue in cheek, she's apparently got the psychological framework in place to ignore her hand in what happened, it's probably critical if your ego's vulnerable (like it probably is if you're seeking romantic validation from someone else when you've recently married without *any* fancy ""understandings"" or celebrity exceptions). She wanted to be the victim because in the common reckoning a victim gets to do whatever they want, up to and sometimes exceeding the original act. OP himself actually stepped in that last one accidentally by threatening the other man in those moments when he was initially threatened sexually, the discovery. Tit for tat would have been banging a maid at the hotel or something.

Whatever. It's an enjoyable story of people's lives being ruined. He destroyed her livelihood so I have some reservations about calling it justice, but all the initial agency was hers and she shouldn't have aired her dirty laundry at the office for any reason, certainly not lied about it. People there have grudges and dry meaningless lives, gossip catches like wildfire (those people *probably* knew OP's Ex was banging the new guy shortly after it happened and she was foolishly trying to get out ahead of it), and OP's lawn was downwind. The emails were like a firebreak he dug on an arsonist's land if it damaged a gas line, leading to a Michael Bay explosion or something.

"I agree. I have been cheated on and was gaslit and abused when I said felt something was wrong. One of the women he cheated on me with was my best friend from college. And despite the deep hurt I felt at what my ex husband did, I still held myself to my values. I want to live a life that leaves the world a little better for those around. I was angry, but still remained gracious to his family and wished everyone well. I had really loved my ex and even now while I’ll speak my truth, I don’t have a desire to ruin him. I was deeply broken and vented to close friends, but I knew one day the dust would settle and I also wanted to feel okay with who I was when I was in the throes of that pain, embarrassment, anger, etc. I believe in sending people away with grace and the universe takes care of the rest. He married a woman he cheated on me with. She’s from a wealthy family so they were living the high life while I scraped by. I worked on healing and figuring who I was and rebuilding. I went to grad school, traveled, bought a home by myself. I’m engaged now to a wonderful man and we have a family. I am no longer quixotic to think someone who says they love me couldn’t betray me. But you know 7 years later, he left her too before being a casualty of the tech layoffs and ending up broke. A part of me felt like “finally, karma!” when I heard… especially since I figured out then that he had married a woman he cheated on me with and that the crazy credit card debt (mostly through cash advances on our joint emergency cards) he left me with was spent financing his dates to woo her and fool her into thinking he was rich, lol. And the rest of me was like, this is a man who I would have given my life for… I genuinely still don’t wish him to suffer. He was suicidal at one point and I don’t wish that on anyone. I think that is what has helped me find peace and abundance. 

I understand that OP is hurt, but I personally wouldn’t feel gleeful at obliterating someone’s life in every possible way.

"> the more work you get done (makeup, lip fillers, botox etc) the worse you look.

No offense, but this seems like a goofy myth to me. Most plastic surgery looks good. You notice it when it doesn't, aka the minority of the time. You'd be hard pressed to find someone renowned for their beauty who hasn't had some interventions and makeup. I have already gotten a decent amount of things done and look way better.

Currently I have a gap between my front teeth, a few crooked bottom teeth, and they aren't perfectly white. I want to finish fixing that as well as get more treatments for my acne scars. Me before proper orthodontic (yes including palate expansion and botox) and skin treatment, and before bleaching my hair and getting better at makeup, was way less attractive.

"Ttl;dr: I (M29) cheated on my ex 3 years ago with some random girl because I wasn’t receiving what I wanted off the relationship.

Before I start, I just want to say that the reason why I did it doesn’t justify me doing it, I know I should have ended that relationship and I sincerely regret what I did. That being said, here goes.

I’ve (M29) always been very loyal to my partners, I had my first girlfriend at age 17 and I’m at my 5th relationship now and have never ever been unfaithful to any of my partners, except my 3rd girlfriend 3 years ago. That means that I’ve been unfaithful to 1 of my 5 partners.

She and I fell for each other, we were doing great and had amazing sex while we were dating. Also, she lived very close. Once we were officially together, two things happened: 1. She moved to another city and 2. Her libido just went through the floor, died, like absolutely nada.

She moved to a city that I had to take a plane ride every time I wanted to see her, I loved her so I still did it. We saw each other maybe once every 3 weeks even though we were doing long distance. I was faithful during the whole relationship, even rejecting a top model in my country because I really don’t like to cheat. The model was “Miss X” from a state in my country, picture Miss Alabama or something but for Colombia. I rejected numerous women while with her.

Anyways, the issue was, her libido literally switched off and we were in a long distance relationship. There were times where we booked flights to see each other after weeks and even months of not seeing each other and we had nothing, no sex, no nothing. On top of that, I just felt like she didn’t appreciate me or liked being with me for some reason. I tried talking to her about it numerous times to no avail unfortunately.

There was this one time when we didn’t see each other for 2 months and when she came to visit she still rejected me. She stayed 3 days and we did absolutely nothing. I dropped her off at the airport and I was livid, I know she doesn’t owe me anything but still, my most pronounced love language is physical touch and I was craving it. This was the time I should have just broken up, I knew the relationship wasn’t going nowhere.

Once I dropped her off at the airport (which is btw a 2hour drive), I was driving back to my house and my best friend called me; “hey man, I’m at a bar with 2 chicks, wanna come?”. And you guys can put together the details of what happened.

I felt terrible, cried a ton and ended the relationship. I just called her because it wasn’t fair to her having to be in a relationship where I cheated till we saw each other again. I ended the relationship, stated it wasn’t working out because of what I previously stated and that’s that. I never told her what really happened because she honestly doesn’t deserve it; she was an amazing person.

Anyways, this is the first time I tell this story and to be honest, it feels great just getting it off my chest."	2spiritAirplane	post	21.185803817064308	male	White	0.9980156421661377	na	na	na	4	offmychest	failed
"Tbh, although you shouldn't have cheated, you ended the relationship pretty much straight after and didn't tell her you cheated which was a wise thing to do (why hurt her more unnecessarily) so kudos for that.

Also, I notice you're from Colombia so English isn't your first language but when you said ""her libido went through the roof"" that implies her libido was very high, you should have said ""her libido fell through the floor"""	2spiritAirplane	reply	na	na	na	0.9980156421661377	weak	no	no	na	offmychest	failed

"throwaway because i cannot have anyone from real life knowing about this,
im a 15 year old girl and my brother is 22. he’s in the military and really nice, but he has been touching me since i was like 9 or something and i knew it was wrong but i didn’t know what to do about it. he grinds his thing against me and gropes my chest and tries to get through my bra whenever im playing the ps4, i always stop him before he does anything but he always continues right after. i was aggressive about it in the past and would scream at him to stop but it never worked so i stopped. he bribes me with things like games and food, my mom doesn’t know and my dad is dead, im done and i just want it to stop. im literally crying rn its really humiliating and i hate it. i don’t wanna tell anyone and i don’t even know why, every time he comes in my room my heart just drops and i get scared every time. he has this new habit of whenever we hug he buries his face in my chest and i hate it. he even has the balls to do it infront of my other brother, and in the same room that i share with my sister.
i just need to get this out because im so close to exploding. i want help so bad"	Visible-Feeling3667	post	8.686172051684904	female	White	0.998339056968689	na	na	na	49	offmychest	failed

"If you don't feel like you're in a position to tell somebody yet and you're not old enough to move out yet, there might be some things you can do to tide you over until you can get out of this situation. 

* Get a deadbolt or door jammer for your bedroom and retreat to your room as soon as you get the feeling he's going to start up again. You can find door jammers on Amazon, they're not too expensive, people use them for extra security when they're on holiday. 
* Sharpen your nails or start wearing sharpened acrylics, and dig them in deep when he touches you. Alternatively, take up a hobby like needlepoint or sewing that gives you an excuse to have sharp objects nearby often. Don't feel bad about hurting him, he hurt you first. 
* If you have an understanding friend or relative, keep a bag of necessities at their house and use it as a refuge. Get out of the house as often as you can when he's around. 
* This is a semi-nuclear option, but adopt a dog. Preferably a small but territorial breed like a jack russell or a beagle that you can train to bark and growl at him when he gets too close. A dog will pick up on your body language and put themselves between you and him, and abusers don't like a lot of noise attracting attention to what they're doing. 

These are only temporary solutions, not a long term thing. Eventually you're going to have to tell someone, you are unfortunately tied to this man by blood and it's very rare for an abuser to have just one victim. I understand that you don't feel safe to say anything right now but when you do feel in a safe position to do so, you should look for SA resources in your area and get some advice from professionals going forward. If I knew what country you're in I could find and link them for you, but any search of rape crisis resources plus the name of your area should bring up the professional network. 

As a survivor of sexual abuse myself, I know how hard it is to cope with and how it can make you too afraid to do anything, but you will not be this vulnerable forever and you can recover."	Visible-Feeling3667	reply	na	na	na	0.998339056968689	no	no	no	na	offmychest	failed

I would tell your older sister and come up with a plan where you won’t be alone with him. Also have her talk to your other brother so others can intervene if he starts it again. Try to get them on your side and once he knows there’s more against him in numbers, hopefully he’ll give up and you won’t have to do anything extreme to “ruin your family”. However, if that doesn’t slow him down than you’ll have to rethink other options. One step at a time so you don’t get too overwhelmed and shut down.

This is what i think you should do. If you have access to a recording device, such as a phone or similar. Then try to set it up secretly recording during times you think he might try something. Do not tell anyone you are doing it. If he tries something while you are recording. Be sure to tell him you dont want him to do that and to stop clearly. If he continues like he has, then you have the whole situation, proving hes doing it without your permission on tape.

Create at least 3 emails and a drop box account. Re upload the video separately and send it securely to each of the emails and save it in the drop box. Then you can take the footage to a trusted adult. Do not let it be your word against his. Do not let there be any question that he knows you dont want what hes doing. Protect yourself OP.

He has no right to your body. Next time he tries something, make sure he walks away hurting. Try to stay in places with other people so you're never alone with him. Anytime he's home on leave, either have a friend come over or avoid your house like the plague.

I'd also like to say that as he is in the military, you are able to report him to his superiors, which will launch an investigation. IDK if you're in the U.S., but there's a reason U.S. soldiers and military civilians have to take monthly sexual harassment and assualt training. It's even worse because you're a minor.

Your brother, if he can really even be called that, is a disgusting POS. Honestly, there aren't enough words to describe how vile he is. You are stronger than you know, OP.

"Hi. I’m currently in graduate school and so is my partner of 3 years. He is in the same class as this guy (let’s call him R). Now, my boyfriend witnessed R cheating on his gf (let’s call her X) with their classmate (let’s call her A).

My boyfriend saw them kissing during a night out and going to coffee shops together, to which R tells his GF, X, that he’s out with his classmates studying.

I debated telling X about this because (1) we aren’t very close; (2) I didn’t know the right time to approach her because she is in medical school; and (3) X and R just moved in together.

A week passed by and I couldn’t stand by knowing this. She deserved better. So I told her the truth. She wanted confirmation so she asked my BF but HE DENIED THIS. My BF then got mad at me for sharing this information with her because it’s none of her business. I texted X that if she wanted confirmation, I could just send her photos because I knew my BF would deny it.

He shamed me for being a gossipmonger and said I didn’t treat the information with privilege. He said R would definitely be mad at him and there would be bad blood between them, and it would be bad because they’re both in the same graduate school. I got upset too because I just couldn’t stand by knowing that someone was getting blindly cheated on and I knew I could do something about it.

He shouldn’t care if there’s bad blood between them because someone with morals wouldn’t want to be friends with someone like that.

"I know many people who think it's a ""life hack"" to put ""not delivered"" and get a refund even if they did actually receive the item. For the most part I think this is immoral and don't agree, but I've begun doing this when the delivery driver doesn't come up my stairs.
For context: I live in a condo complex and we are the only unit upstairs. The stairs in question are 15 steps and lead up from the street. The neighborhood consists of some homeless people who are nice but will take packages if they see them laying out. Also, one of our neighbors has been known to steal packages as well as take anything that's been delivered on accident to their house.
We have a camera above our front door so that we can catch anyone stealing our packages, but it does not reach the bottom of our stairs. The stairs don't belong to us so we are not allowed to put a camera on the stairs either. So if something is delivered at the bottom and someone takes it, we won't be able to see it on camera.
In recent years delivery drivers have begun delivering at the bottom of the stairs. This is typically the drivers for Amazon and food delivery. We have had many packages and food stolen because of this.
I started writing in the delivery instructions: ""unit is upstairs, please deliver to door or neighbors may take it."" But the drivers seem to ignore it. Because of this, I have begun requesting a refund, even if I'm home and am able to run down and grab the package when I see it's down there. I mostly do this to act as a deterrent and since I've begun doing this we've been receiving our items at our door more and more.

"So I’ll speedrun the story. 

Essentially there’s a girl I know who is quite popular on social media. Not so popular she’s a household name but she’s built a big community for herself. 

Well I found out her and her husband are into cuckolding and they’ve publicly shared videos of her fucking other dudes on alternative accounts.

If I blasted it all over their socials it’d certainly cause a rift but if I reuped it on different accounts with different titles “cheating on my husband while he’s away at work”, “wife looking for affair partner” etc. and shared it with his family, and then shared their page with her family I think it’d cause insurmountable family drama. Share it on their socials too. 

Her husband is also a college athlete. He’d get roasted by their entire university. 

Frankly I know this makes me sound like a piece of shit but I really would love to see this through. I really don’t even have anything against either of them, I’ve only ever had pleasant interactions with them. I would just get a lot of joy from ripping up all their progress in the puzzle of life lmao. It would make me insanely happy to know everybody close to them couldn’t look at either of them the same again. 

It would be completely devastating to their life circumstances. It’s very, very hard to resist the temptation.

I’m a bull in the community and there’s plenty of couples I’ve messed with that aren’t together anymore. It definitely makes relationships more fragile despite the claims to the contrary.  In my experience, what’ll happen if it gets out on this scale is that they’ll have lots of fights about who’s idea it was to post or even start the lifestyle to begin with (he admits himself he pressured her into it) etc. 

I’ve done this kinda thing before but never to a married couple. The thrill can keep me awake for days keeping a pulse on things unfolding. It’s like a game of chess for me. When they pull posts down and I have already have a counter that makes sure no matter what they do their damage control isn’t effective. 

It’s incredible. You can sense the panic happening in real time, and when they stop trying you know they’re broken down, crying somewhere and likely alone because they don’t have any structure of support that will be able to understand. 

I’m writing this instead of doing it because it helps me get through the high I get from this kind of emotional sadism."	GET-a-ROTH-IRA	post	28.516766850776282	female	White	0.004858906846493483	na	na	na	1	offmychest	no prediction.
"I (16f) am sick of seeing my parents give each other the silent treatment since so many days now. At this point I want them to either fight or talk about their feeling but they won't do that. I'm the one stuck as the owl carrying one message after the other. Even when my dad tries to talk or makes a normal convo my mom either ignores him or gives bland replies. It's not the first time this is happening, every time they are mad at each other they do this instead of talking about their feelings until things cool off and they start acting normal. However, now this has been happening more frequently and for longer time periods.

It has gotten really frustrating for me and I can't even express my anger because then they'll get mad at me. It's not that they don't love me or my brother or each other. They even care for each other deeply. I just want my 12 y/o little brother to see our parents like I saw when I was a kid but they're not like they used to be and I hate that.

I don't want them to grow apart but I don't know what to do. I can't sit and talk to them about it because every time I try I start crying because I can't control my tears or anger which makes me incapable of talking about my feelings and most of the times it results to me being scolded for crying without any reason."	already_taken1101	post	3.494290964079415	female	White	0.9993591904640198	na	na	na	4	offmychest	no prediction.
"Well first of all, im in my twenties now, and ive definitely been there as far as parents being assholes to eachother. So i get what youre going through. 

Second, as much as it sucks to say, it could be a hell of a lot worse. They could be blowing up at eachother all the time. it still isnt an ideal situation, but it could be worse. 

if youre brave enough for it, you could try and bring it up that you dont like them acting like this because it hurts you. They may not recieve it well but its worth a try. My mother regularly admits when she's had a little too much to drink that one of her biggest regrets is letting me see just how much they used to fight. 

As for why they're giving eachother the silent treatment? when youve spent a long time married to someone, and you dont properly communicate, little things can get blown out of proportion so often. The things that set eachother off can just be a small thing that was never discussed or resolved but theyve been together so long its become a major issue. Ive seen my parents melt down at eachother over forgetting to put a bottle of soda back in the fridge. Its easy to think your parents are so much more mature than you at your age, but theyre just grown up immature idiots half the time. being older doesnt always mean being wiser, especially when it comes to proper communication.

Now this year it's around the same time when my mom started getting sick. And they're kind of back to the same place and a few days ago she even said ""it would have been better had I died"" in front of me and my brother.

I wouldnt jump straight to that assumption btw, reddit has just conditioned me to think of that unfortunately. 

Maybe if you sit your mom down and just ask, without placing blame, why they argue so much.

">Is it possible either of your parents was unfaithful?

There is no chance for that.

Actually, I don't think they ever resolved their conflict before. It just got buried as she got sick and they just forgot about it.

The main thing is that they don't really have anything to fight about. Just a small conflict (usually related to my grandma\*) turns into them ignoring each other until they cool off but instead of cooling off they keep the ignoring game on.

\*my grandma (dad's mom) is a shitty person in general. My dad tries to avoid conflict because grandma makes a huge deal out of it starts crying and shit and complaining to her daughters about what dad said (blowing it out of proportion) so dad mainly tries to ignore her and her jabs. But mom when mom gets mad at grandma she gets angry in general which also means angry with dad and me.

"My (24) younger brother (21) did something a few years ago that made me so viscerally uncomfortable I just shove it out of my brain whenever it pops back up. I was home from college (19) and he was 16. We have never been close, but I really wanted to have a relationship with him so we were playing video games together. Then I saw his privates... And panic-struck told him I could see. I can't even remember if I'm making this part up, but a few minutes later he was pulling it out and touching himself.

I have a history of sexual abuse so I just froze and I have a lot of regret about this considering I was an adult and he wasn't. I kind of just left as fast as possible, locked myself in my room, and cried. And when I came back out he was touching himself on the sofa in full view of me, though he later apologized for me catching him he never once mentioned what happened in his room.

I dont want to assume the worst because he was a kid. He has some behavioral problems my mom never treated him for despite me saying it was a problem.

"I was raped when I was 15 (now 26) at a party. The man was 22. My friends were there and refuse to believe I was raped. We went to a cabin to drink, we were all hanging out on the front porch and I went inside to pee. I was stumbling around so my friend said she’d take me, the rapist said oh don’t worry about it I’m going inside for another drink so I’ll make sure she made it okay. I go to the bathroom and when I’m coming out he approached me and asked to take some shots with me. I was obviously a very immature drinker at 15 so I took a few and got really dizzy and he walked me to a bed. I thought he was being nice and helpful like he was supposed to be in the first place. Then he lays down with me and this is when it gets bad. He keeps trying to touch me and I say no a million times but nothing stops. I ended up being so scared I just passed out, probably also from being drunk. I realized it in the morning and wanted to leave. My friends wanted to stay and I’m like no we have to go. My phone was dead and even if it wasn’t I didn’t have service anyway out in the middle of no where. We ended up leaving after saying my mom wanted me home and wondered where I was making the older guys paranoid. 

A few days later one of the guys friends texted me acting weird. Basically trying to cover it up. I don’t remember exactly it was 11 years ago and I blocked him right after. Rapist guy messaged me too, I also don’t remember and he’s blocked. Very guilty sounding and trying to gaslight me but I just removed them from my life.

I never reported it because I didn’t want to get in trouble for going out and partying or something???? Idk what my thought process was. I was also scared no one would believe me and people would think I’m a liar and be scared to date me (small town highschool problems). So I never told anyone besides my friends. The friends that were outside never believed me. There are multiple times where one specific friend made jokes on various occasions. She asked how many people I slept with, I named them and she goes “what about (rapist)” with a smirk. She said just because he’s gross and it’s embarrassing doesn’t mean I can say he raped me. “You can’t say they raped you just because you regret having sex with them” sticks with me. 

I wish I could go back in time and report it the morning after it happened. Now he walks free and probably out doing it to other girls. I feel bad for letting it slide. I feel bad for getting made fun of and accused of lying. People like this are sickening. I have a daughter now and can’t believe things like this happen and I’m so scared for her.

"So, I(m23) became extremely uncomfortable with my emotions and expressing them around 10 or 12 years old. As such I hated letting anyone know when I was happy, sad, mad, or aroused. Throughout high school I met 2 friends that enjoyed me even though I had this persona and was a very introverted and quiet person. I met them because we played the same games and realized this when I happened to sit at a lunch table they usually sat at. I could be enthusiastic and interested in games without feeling emotionally exposed.

Near the end of high school and the beginning of college they and some of our online friends would talk about what women they found attractive and whatnot. I was slowly letting down my emotion shell around them, but it was still pretty solid at this point, so I just said that I was asexual to avoid the topic. Some of my friends doubted a bit, but as I logically laid out how emotionally detached I was and told them that I grew up in society so I understand beauty standards, but don't really get aroused by women or men they accepted it. I have always been an oddball that is hard to understand to them. The truth was that I'm pansexual but didn't feel comfortable expressing such a deep part of myself when I had been so emotionally detached for almost half my life at that point.

Now, both of them have had major relationships and I am starting to let go of my emotional shell in general, so I feel a lingering emptiness when they talk about being intimate with their partners. They have made it a small talking point when introducing me to some of their friends and partners, so I feel a little bit of pressure to keep up the jig. But I also still don't feel comfortable expressing my preferences and desires of intimacy to them, even though they have been very open to me about their feelings and experiences with their partners.

I'm so sorry you've needed to put up that shell in the first place, but I understand, the only emotion I show is happiness, never anything else, I've been detached emotionally until my meeting my ex boyfriend. Well, lets just say the breakup made things worse. And I feel like I can't ""love"" my current partner (I love being with him, find him attractive, smart, kind, all of it) but I feel like letting myself love him will just break me again. 
So the advice I can give you as a very broken person is take your time to meet someone, keep some boundaries, maybe introduce intimacy a little later in the relationship so you can ease in a little bit. 
For keeping up the act, I think you can have an innocent conversation with those friends along the line of, hey how does it feel to be attracted I think I might start feeling something, or start feeling the need for a relationship. Remember that humans evolve with time, so as you shell breaks away you are more receptive to relationships~ I am certain they would understand and be supportive of you!

"I have been with my husband 24 for 7 years married for 2. He is my best friend and pretty much the only person I talk to. I am a sahm to our 2 kids 2 and 1. 
 I caught my husband in the beginning stages of cheating. He was messaging strangers for pics. He states that he doesn't think it was cheating but admitted he wouldn't like it if i was doing that. He says he knew it was wrong after the first message but still sent multiple messages to different people. 
   When I first found out I told him I would discuss what happened after our boys went to bed because it wasn't appropriate for their ears. Instead of waiting he wrote me a letter and stated he knew what he did was wrong would always love me but knew divorce was inevitable and that we could discuss visitation with the boys when he came to get the rest of his things in a week. I had to stop his car and take the keys to stop him from leaving. 
    He then took both the boys via stroller and disappeared for 4 hours without any word leaving me a complete wreck and having my whole family out looking for them.  
    We were finally able to have a discussion yesterday night for 30 minutes before he had to leave for work and it felt like a 1 sided condo between myself. Im unsure what to do or how to proceed.

He already checked out of this marriage and family and wants to get it over with as soon as possible.

"Tw: mild mentions of what happened 

Realizing what it was really was like being hit on the head with a brick. I could never imagine my ex having done what he did because it wasn't stereotypical. I never viewed my ex as a bad person and now I am. I should have known after he said he always ""worried"" he coerced me as a reason to why he immediately would leave after sex, even when I'd be crying. I should have known when I said ""actually, I'm not sure if I want to do this anymore"" and then he turned me around and did it. I kept telling myself he just didn't hear me. I should have known when I made it explicitly clear that penetration wasn't allowed this one time and less than a minute later, he penetrated and I went silent. His excuse? ""I must have forgotten but I never would have done that if I knew you didn't want to because that's against my morals."" My friends told me it was rape and I couldn't even fathom it.

The story goes as follows: I get into a new class, develop a crush on a classmate. About half a year later I finally build up the courage to ask her out, she rejects me. I find out she had a crush on me too but no longer seems to have feelings for me. I also overhear her talking bad about about me like calling me ugly behind my back and saying if I wasn't so red (I have rosacea) she would maybe date me. I read somewhere that scientifically it's impossible to fall for the same person twice so I'm afraid she will never feel for me again. I feel very overwhelmed with all of this. I don't know what to do.	Short-Condition-6637	post	16.021312305842766	male	White	0.9977512955665588	na	na	na	1	offmychest	failed
"Honestly, learning to move on is one of the best things you can gain from these experiences when you're young. IMO the best thing you can do is, nothing. Just try to move past this. Next time you deal with rejection it will be easier.

If she has been talking shit about you behind your back, this isn't really someone you want to be dating. Making fun of you for a skin condition is out of order.

"In terms of looks, trust me when I say this, I’m not ugly. I’m slightly above average. I’ve a nice smile, nice jawline, 6’2 ft, and people describe me as approachable. I’m super skinny guy though 160 pound ectomorph. 
My education, BA in mathematics and Physics. Please don’t call me “nerd” or “smart”. I would love purse a graduate degree.

My history with women is close to nonexistent. In part, I’ve had 6-9 girls flirt with me; I mean I am easy guy to talk to so makes sense. I’ve had girls blush around me too.
So why am I single? My confidence goes up and down. The older and older I seem to get, the more my confidence tanks. My job is a nice little weak paying job. I do sports with children, and keep a close eye on park where they play, but one of the is a nice little girl from a very chill nice catholic family one day out of nowhere pointed her finger towards me and said, “You look lonely”. Those words really hurt man. My loneliness should’ve been something concealed but I was somehow unconsciously projected a lonely ora. A message for everyone to read. The child’s honesty was very much needed. My diagnosis of my single life is due to my philosophy in life—maybe! 
 I’ve noticed that talking a lot and being overly expressive is extremely insecure and calls everyone to disrespect you. So, I tend to talk with purpose and say what’s necessary. The less you talk, the more people tend to respect. Silence is the safest thing. I absolutely hate parties. One day, at any moment, I will be in a grave and dead. It’s really hard to party when you’re conscious about your inevitable demise. I hate all types of “escapisms”

I’m also obviously religious—very religious. I always think of my death and my sins—the usual. The more I grow in age, the more religion makes sense. If I’m entering a relationship, it better be a marriage. 
Hence, that’s what stopped me from doing 1-night stands. I think the majority of my “opportunities” to start a relationship with women was swiftly ended by me because I knew none of these women were interested in a long term relationship. At time, I’m unintentionally act shy hence hurting my chances at things

As for other religions women like me, there’s plenty. But after high-school, I stopped interacting with them because, I’m simply not around them anymore. Uni, work, gym, and home.

"You are putting way too much pressure on a relationship from the outset. Your expectations are wholly unrealistic. Women want to get to know someone before deciding to commit (unless you are buying a foreign bride, which is quite frankly gross). If you are insistent that dating must only be for marriage it is too much for any sane person who just wants to get to know you and see if you have two heads or skeletons in the closet. 

Just because you want to have sex, doesn’t mean you need to get married yesterday. You need to decide what actually matters most to you: finding a healthy loving relationship, being a very religious person or losing your virginity. I suspect you can have two of the three in the medium term, but not all three.

I dont why but nobody at my school likes me and none of my few friends are able to come over. but even if i asked. he would say no because he starts asking to many personal questions about them, whether to their face or to me. He then started calling me a names i cant say and a loser who has no friends and i broke down and started yelling. I asked him why he always does this and why he hates me. and he kept getting in my face even when i walked away, so i punched him and he began to throw stuff around my room and yell at me calling me a disgrace and how he hates me.

Hello redditors,

I hope this post finds you okay. I'm Ryan, and I'm really struggling with something right now. I just need to get it off my chest.

I've been incredibly lucky to get a full scholarship for an MBA program in China. It's a huge opportunity, and I've been so excited about it. But here's the problem: I come from a 3rd world country, and I'm having a really hard time coming up with $1200 for paperwork fees.

I feel like I'm at a crossroads, and it's terrifying. If I can't sort out these fees, I might not be able to go to China and follow my dream. And honestly, staying in my current country feels scary and uncertain. My life feels like it's falling apart, and it's hard to see a way forward.

I'm sorry if I'm sounding negative. I just don't have many people to talk to about this, and it's been eating me up inside. If anyone's been through something similar or has any advice, I'd really appreciate hearing from you.

Thanks for listening."	yungfellaa	post	20.08493905810545	female	White	0.00787830539047718	na	na	na	2	offmychest	failed

You are a liar. You claim to never lie, but just did right to my face. Why wouldn’t I question you about a repeated suspicious behavior? You try to convince me that I’m hearing things (more gaslighting) but I know better. So now I don’t know what to do with this development. I started to believe you. I was “letting it go” & chalking it all up to misunderstanding, like you claimed. This morning solidified my suspicions, again. I know I was right before. I know you’re hiding something. Even if I didn’t know you lied you’re irate answer told me a lot. What do I do? How do I react? I’m spiraling. I’m drifting back to that cliff edge. You’ve been lying to me for years. I don’t know what to do. I can’t be stuck in this emotional loop again. I barely survived the first time and will make sure not to survive this time. And it’ll all be your lying fault.

I agree. Trust your gut OP, even though they are gonna try and force you to trust them instead. They know exactly what they are doing and each time you try and resolve things, they will double down, triple down and so on until you are completely destroyed and severely traumatized. What you'll notice is that they are never, ever in the wrong...it's always you who is wrong, at fault, misunderstood them, have the wrong perception, etc. They will even tell you they never hurt you and that they don't care. They will even tell you that they were good to you and gave you so much. Chances are, they genuinely enjoy seeing you suffer.

"I can't help but I want to cry and really angry. I recently started my masters journey in a private institute. The dean of our department organized a orientation thing for three days with industrial experts ( I am doing msc in media science ) although the one hour ( 10-5 with one hour lunch ) talk of those successful personas are really helpful but I can't talk the pressure other students feel same. They are coming one by one with their different experience, morals and stuff so many different things they are saying our brain can't handle it's extremely boring and headache are constant. Even if we are trying to concentrate our brain is just not talking in anything!!!! For me I am feeling lost brain is literally hanging I attended lectures continuously before although I felt bad but still not this bad honestly it's not for us if they are forcing it on us!!!! We can't leave if you can't take anymore it's just going to waste. I have stomach and backache since my periods are almost here I tried to leave they allowed today but I have to go tomorrow but trust me I will not understand anything and will not take anything from that. It's too boring and tomorrow most probably my periods will Start ( I have 70% of the pain before starting when it happens I know it will starting the next day ) I really don't want to listen, don't want it because I will not enjoy the lesson in general. Honestly it's too much for our brain to take. It's good but I think they should have arrange it a day of each week so we can actually learn anything
I am bad at explaining but in brief these sessions are too much for us professors of our department and seniors are being themselves while we can't take continuous lecture and perspective!!!!!

"I am a 25 (F) and my husband is a 32 (M). We have known each other for almost ten years now and been married for 2 years with a two year old son.
Ever since I gave birth to my beautiful baby boy I've noticed things that I suspect have been there all along, but that I always ignored or thought were normal. 
When I was pregnant there were complications and I was forced to have my son a month early and I was not able to leave the hospital bed for 4 days. I couldn't even get up to hold or care for my baby. My husband constantly points out that he had to change all the newborn diapers which aren't easy to clean.  If I am busy cleaning or cooking and our son needs changed he always uses this excuse or says he'll do it in a bit and I end up having to do it because it's not right for my son to sit and walk in his own waste. 
When he does take care of changing him, he leaves the wet or dirty diapers in a pile in our hallway. (We live in a small home and can't fit the changing table anywhere really convenient). Anyone who has kids knows that those smells can get pretty bad.. When the smell gets bad he complains that the house needs to be cleaned and I bite my tongue and just clean up all the soiled diapers. 
I can't get him to understand that I am the only one in the house that works a full time job. I work an overnight shift and I roughly get an average of 5 to 6 hrs of sleep each day.  He won't let me sleep pay 2:00 pm and I don't get home until 7 a.m. It takes about 1 to 2 hours for me to fall asleep.
It's exhausting trying to pick up after my toddler, my husband, and myself on a daily basis. Because of this my house is always trashed and has dirty laundry, dirty dishes, trash, and toys everywhere. My husband is constantly complaining about how the house looks and says that we need to clean it. But, every time I try to get him to spend one day to help me clean, he goes into his office claiming that he needs to do paperwork and stays in there all day. On more than one occasion I've gone in while cleaning to put something away in there and caught him playing mine craft. This annoys me to no end but, I hate confrontation with people and I just walk away and never say anything. 
A few times I've pointed out to him that he could easily help keep up on the dishes now that we have a dishwasher, but most times he won't even put away clean dishes so all the dirty dishes pile up on the counter. And even when he does put the dishes away and sets up the dish washer he refuses to put away the hand washed dishes and won't the dirty ones that can't go in the dishwasher. 
This makes me so mad because a lot of those dishes that need to be hand washed are our sons dishes. So then I'm scrambling at dinner to wash dishes so I can feed my screaming child who doesn't understand why I'm not feeding him right away. I've talked to my husband numerous times that he could help out more but, he just says that I'm to picky about how I want things done and he doesn't want to listen to me complain that he put something away in the wrong spot.
I've told him that I would rather spend 10 min putting things into the proper place then having to spend all my time off being the only one cooking, cleaning, and tending to our son. 
I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I'm just so burnt out and have no energy to do anything. The only reason that I keep going anymore is because of my son. I don't ever want him to live the same way I did as a child. In a filthy home. But I feel like my husband views me as either a child who doesn't tend to responsibilities or as a maid and housekeeper. I don't feel like I'm a partner to him.

That doesn't matter does it? You got into a relationship with a man significantly older than you because you didn't want to be in the situation you were in anymore, not recognizing he's creating the exact same situation.

"Yesterday I (M31) was out doing errands with my girlfriend (F28). We were driving down a 5 lane road next to a highschool that was under construction, so traffic was diverted to one lane each. We are pulling up to a stoplight when we see a child in his diaper running down the opposite lane. I drove up next to him and got out to grab him, but my girlfriend was able to get out of the car and get to him way before I could. She pulled the kid into the grass, as he is fighting her to get away the whole time. I parked the car and came back to her where a few other people had gathered. One lady called the police for us, but before they could arrive a woman came out from the housing complex right next to the road. She said she knew the kid, and she would take him home. So she picked him up and started carrying him off. I followed, and informed her that I was coming with because I wouldn't be able to sleep if I didn't know that things ended well. She was obviously uncomfortable, which I can totally understand. People don't trust men with children. I kept a healthy distance from the woman, and after realizing that she had no interest in talking to me, I just started rambling. It was only a 3 minute walk or so, I said a bunch of stuff like ""wow, this really puts that old saying of 'it takes a village to raise a child' to a whole new level. We only have dogs so maybe this is good training..."" So on and so forth. I just wanted to make her feel as comfortable as possible, because I wasn't leaving without figuring out where the kid lived for the police report. I don't think she said a single word to me except for ""no"" when I asked if she would like a break from carrying the child, as she was exhausted. While we were walking, I also noticed some bruising on the kids arm like he has been pinched, and he wouldn't speak a word to anyone at any point. He was also fighting her to get away, just like he was fighting my girlfriend. This little guy did not want to go home. He was scared.

After our brief walk, we got to the apartment with it's door wide open. The lady who carried the boy home was frantically knocking on the open door and ringing the door bell. After a minute or so the mother came out in just a towel. I decided to make myself scarce since she was in a vulnerable state. I stepped to the side of the door and listened as this lady described what had happened to the mother. Through conversation I learned that the child has autism, and is non-verbal. Mom says he was just napping, and she had just hopped into the shower because she thought he was down for a while. They conclude their conversation, and now that she isn't holding a child I walk back towards the car with this lady. I continued rambling because it was awkward as fuck. She still won't talk to me, even when there isn't a kid involved.

The cops showed up about 10 minutes later. My girlfriend was coming off an adrenaline rush, and she was having a hard time composing her thoughts, plus she had done her part in pulling him to safety. There was another gentleman that stuck around until the police arrived. He was the first person to find the child, and he was trying to get to him but traffic prevented him from being able to help in the moment. So he told the begining of the story and I told the end of it. I gave the police officer their address, informed her of the bruising on his arm, his scared reaction to going home, and I shared that he has autism and is non-verbal. The police officer thanked us, then got into her car to make a couple of phonecalls. GF and I waited for a few more minutes to talk about what had just happened. And I wanted to make sure the officer didn't just drive off without checking the unit. They made their way towards the home after the phonecalls, and we went home.

I feel awful. I know I shouldn't let other people's actions affect me so strongly. But we literally pulled a kid out of traffic, and it felt like this lady thought I wanted to kidnap this kid out of her arms or something. We were in a situation where we all wanted the kid to get home safe and sound, but I got treated like some pervert.

Secondly, this brought up a lot of shit for me. I explained to my girlfriend on the way home that I remember when CPS would come do checks on me, my brother, and our mom. Everytime it happened we would have to do a mad dash to clean as much of the house as possible before they got there. And my mom would sit us down to do some brainwashing, telling us that the people that were coming over were ""icky bad people who will take us away from her if we aren't on our best behavior"" and how ""we can't trust the things they say. They may seem nice, but Satan hides in sheep's clothing"" kind of shit. So I remember what that is like. It is stressful for the parent to have CPS involved. Then the stress on the parent turns into pressure on the kid, who doesn't even know how bad of a situation they might be in. All they know is that Mom has been there for their whole life, and being taken away is unimaginable. The poor kid from today might be in a worse spot than me, and with fewer tools in his toolbox than I had. My heart is breaking, and at this point I'm not even sure why exactly."

"I think you did all the right things here. You stopped to assist, and figured out where the child lived so you could tell the police. The woman carrying the child might have just been worried about protecting the mother's reputation, or was even angry at the mother herself. Her frustration may not have been at you, but at having to deal with this situation. As someone who struggles with anxiety issues, we can sometimes think someone is upset with us when their focus isn't even on us at all.

You provided what you needed to, and it's up to the professionals to handle it from here. Maybe it really was just a mistake. I'm sure raising a child with autism is frustrating and exhausting. The bruises might be from the mom, or maybe the kid pinches himself when he gets frustrated. Or maybe a friend or cousin pinched him. The police and/or CPS will look into it and figure it out. All you know is a young child was running through the streets unattended, and you weren't the only one who reacted with concern.

"We’ve felt obligated to call CPS on a neighbor before and the child was removed. Like you, it affected me, more so my wife. We had small children at the time, and we had some real concerns about what would happen to the child when he was removed—would he be placed in kinship care? Would he be placed with a foster family? How scared is that child?

Ultimately, we (like you) did the right thing by reporting abuse or neglect, but it didn’t feel like the right thing. We made a decision that day to become foster parents so that we can comfort and care for the poor children removed from shitty situations, afraid and alone. 

I know that I am privileged to have the home, stability, and emotional capacity to offer care to kids, and not everybody has that. But if you do—now or in the future—consider fostering.

I’m not saying she’s a bad person, but clearly she might need some support in caring for the kid. The child’s safety is the most important thing. That’s what CPS is there for. No more, no less."

"Thank you. I've been talking with my girlfriend about this since I made the post. I think that the biggest problem here is that we brought the poor kid back to his home where he did not want to be. Apparently through conversations my girlfriend heard that ""this is not the first time CPS has gotten involved in the house, and it won't be the last."" We did what we were supposed to do. But I am struggling with closure because I am not convinced that he went back to a good and happy home. I don't know what he went back to, and I likely never will. So my girlfriend has pointed out that my brain is autofilling his circumstances with my own experience. In my experience most of the adults in my childhood failed me. It is heart wrenching to feel like an adult who failed this poor child.

I mean, my hands were tied. I couldn't tell the mother that I didn't trust her with her child, because that is kidnapping. I made sure CPS was aware of the situation, but I know how well someone can act when the stakes are high. And this poor child doesn't even have a voice to ask for help. I'm accepting that there isn't a single version of how this story played out where I'm satisfied with the end result. There is not a satisfactory outcome. There is no way for me to fix this for him."

"I’ve been in a “situationship” for over 3 years now. When we first started dating, we didn’t really want anything serious. I dated around, they did too. And then somehow, someway, we started to get feelings for each other. We’ve basically integrated ourselves with each others’ families and friends.

At some point, earlier this year, I’ve basically started to change my mind. I wanted something exclusive. But I didn’t know how to communicate it so it basically ended with me telling them that they could still date around, just that I didn’t want to know and to please keep it hidden from me.

Only, I found out. Gut instincts + seeing it for myself (receipts, not the physical thing). And I broke down. I told them I wanted exclusivity. They relented. I was emotional and they said they never wanted to be the cause of me hurting. So okay, agreed. But the conversation never felt finished. I’ve had anxiety and kept questioning and thinking to myself how I felt selfish cuz I didn’t consider what they actually wanted. But at the same time, I knew what they wanted was something that could hurt me.

But we did try it. Being exclusive and it made them depressed. It made them feel trapped/restricted/etc. And I felt guilty and anxious that I made them feel that way.

So we had another talk. I told them I was willing to consider opening our relationship. But that we, especially me, needed some boundaries, code words, and uncomfortable conversations. They were elated. Like a weight had been lifted off their shoulders. 

But after that talk, I’ve basically felt anxious on and off. Scared. Tired. Angry at them, at myself. And maybe a little empty. I felt so many ugly emotions, it was hard to sleep next to them.

"To keep it brief, I’m an introvert who wants to become more extroverted and less socially anxious. So I’ve been trying to get over the nerves of talking with strangers and such.

This is my first week of university and I had seen a girl which was somewhat cute and kept glancing at me, so I thought she might’ve been interested. Anyway I didn’t get the courage to talk to her until today. I went to talk with her mostly to get over the nerves of doing something like that. She was with two of her friends (guy and a girl) when I went to say hi, they just stared at me and kept quiet which made me more nervous but I just kept it up, anyway at the end I got her instagram. But looking at her good she doesn’t interest me.

The problem is that she has class in the same building as I do (we’re not in the same class though) so no matter what I do next will be awkward i assume. Should I text her that I did it to get over my social anxiety? Or that Im not interested anymore? Or should I just not talk to her?

That's not particularly close to the way OP described his actions. He got a sense that someone had some sort of interest and initiated a conversation. If he isn't making the other person uncomfortable, what is the problem?

A few months ago I (20’s) added someone on Snapchat off of a Snapchat sub on here. On their post on the sub they stated they were 18. I added them, we snapped for a bit, and then at their request I sent them an explicit photo of myself. After I sent the photo they revealed they were actually 16. Naturally I panicked. I admonished them for not telling me earlier. They attempted to continue the conversation but I said I don’t talk to jailbait and unfriended them. I then promptly had a severe panic attack. It’s Snapchat so everything should’ve been deleted, unless they saved something or took a screenshot after I unfriended them (in my panic I only unfriended them instead of blocking so they still would’ve been able to see the chats on their end). They didn’t send me anything and I didn’t ask them to, and I didn’t send them anything after I learned their real age. Even tho there probably isn’t evidence of the chats left I’m so scared of this somehow surfacing in the future and ruining my life and reputation. My anxiety and fear around this has been so bad I’ve been having almost daily panic attacks and am seriously contemplating suicide (but I’ve had issues with that before this). Idk what to do or how to move on from this. I’m not a pervert or a pedo, this was a singular mistake that I made while drunk and lonely. But I just can’t shake the shadow of this that follows me around, and I’m worried the anxiety will follow me for the rest of my life. I might actually kill myself because of this. What do I do? Am I a bad person?	Available-Mouse-5339	post	36.5279234964666	female	White	0.9989702701568604	na	na	na	20	offmychest	failed
There is a very high chance that it wasn't even a woman you sent this to. There are ton of scammers out there who asked you to send them a sexy pic, and then when you do they say they're underage and then they begin to Blackmail you. I see somebody posting about it that they got scammed by it about once a week on this thread alone. You probably by stopping chatting with them and blocking them, avoided the scam artist.

Not sure how the rules work in your area but you're def not a bad person. Plus she was the one who asked for a pic. After sending one that's when she said she was 16. She did this on purpose	Available-Mouse-5339	reply	na	na	na	0.9989702701568604	weak	no	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.
I don’t know where you live or what the laws are in your area but I don’t see how the law would see your actions as so unreasonable. You send that photo provided with the information that she was 18, that is what they told you. Your intentions are shown in your actions. You clearly would not have sent the pic if you had known they were 16. I’m a law student if this puts your mind at ease. Try not to worry about a problem that hasn’t happened yet, I doubt any legal action is going to come from this. I do see how you could be a little bit paranoid though!

You’re not a bad person and considering months have gone by and nothing came of it I doubt it will now. I’m sure she has done this to many people if she tried saying she was 18 before hand. I would be concerned if you continued anything after hearing she was 16 but you did not so she has no evidence other than possibly a photo which isn’t enough to do anything with. Just take a deep breathe and  if this is something she regularly does I’m sure your interaction with her is insignificant and she isn’t thinking about it anymore and nothing will come of it in the future. Think about the situation as a whole. People send nudes all the time even to people they don’t know very well, if they asked for it and you were okay with sending there’s nothing wrong with that. She made the mistake of hiding her real age until after the fact, you didn’t know that. You did nothing wrong, she did. It’s a scary situation but I think it’s one you need to let roll of your back.

I didn’t block them, I just removed them as a friend.

The very fact that you’re worrying about this just proves how good of a person you are. You cut off contact with them as soon as you found out they were 16. I doubt they would have screenshotted anything because their lie was the pre-requisite to your actions, and I think it’s even less likely that they’re going to go to the police or FBI or anything to file or report anything. There was no malicious intention here. Your mens rea, or mental process at the time was that you believed them to be 18. That is what aligns with your actions (sending the pic), regardless of whether or not that turned out to be true. This is not the combination for a crime and it can be clearly argued otherwise. There is no way you could have known that they were not 18 unless they told you the truth. It would also be very unreasonable for a court of law to say otherwise, let alone suggest that you should have asked for some sort of age verification, especially given the fact that they had given you assurance of their age. Being penalised for something you did not know until after is retroactive and not at all what the law advocates.

Because to your knowledge the person was not a minor and they said they were 18. You did your due diligence by selecting someone who said that they were legally an adult. Had you either 1. Not asked or been told they were 18, or 2. Selected someone knowing they were a minor, it could be problematic, but that’s not the case here.

"Hi all, tldr, I slept with my guy friend and caught feelings. For some background, we sat next to each other during our summer internship and we both work in a very high stress job with long hours so we saw each other almost 24/7 for multiple months straight. We realized that we have a lot of mutuals and ended up going out together (with our group of friends) often. We ate almost every meal together (since we worked long hours) and overall just spent a lot of time together both in and outside of work. All of this was very platonic as he had a girlfriend for a majority of the time period (he broke up with his girlfriend a week before the internship ended due to other reasons). 

Fast forward, we both ended up dealing with something extremely stressful towards the end of the internship, got really drunk on a night out, and ended up hooking up. Both he and I do not hook up with people (both our first hookup). I didn’t stay the night because I knew it was not a smart idea to do so since we didn’t really have a “thing”. However, he was leaving the city we are both in two days after so we ended up grabbing dinner to say good bye. The dinner was normal but we didn’t bring up what happened - I had to call him after the dinner to briefly discuss our hookup. He said that it didn’t mean anything and that we were both really drunk and stressed. When I heard that I honestly wanted to tell myself that the sex meant nothing too and that I could handle a hook up but it’s been a week and I don’t think that is the case at all. We still text everyday not about personal things but about work- related stuff. However he throws in random questions to ask me how I’m doing/my plans for the day/etc. But that may be him trying to be nice? 

Anyways, I really care about our friendship - we cared for each other all summer long especially in such a high stress environment and I fully expected our friendship to last for years to come. However, my feelings for him are here and I don’t see them going away. He just got out of a relationship and realistically, he probably doesn’t see me the same way I see him especially given the fact that he said the sex meant nothing. 

I could squash my feelings and continue being friends with him but I don’t know how that is going to work (it is very hard). If I tell him, I lose our friendship but I can definitely move on. I don’t know what to do in this case or how to view it. It hurts."	081245	post	14.720915070521766	male	White	0.0031953100115060806	na	na	na	18	offmychest	failed

"I'm a 23m and work at my parents company. We have to buy our own tools and toolboxes which I understand, but it puts a strain on my bank account as I'm starting fresh with no tools to start with. I don't eat lunch usually so when 12 hits I just go to my spot to chill while everyone takes their hour, again my bank is dry so I sit it out, I only eat dinner. Every so often one of my coworkers comes and offers to pay for my lunch, and about half the time I'll say sure. 

My mom calls me to the office and tells me that I'm manipulating them, and making them feel bad,   and to stop, because me being their son makes them ( my parents ) look bad. I'll add that my mom is HR and my dad owns the company. I've never asked anyone nor implied that I was hungry, always just sat on my phone. So that day my close coworker had taken me to lunch before I was called in the office, so I went to him and apologized, and asked him to not invite me to lunch but he said it's fine and that he wanted me to go with them. 

The entire rest of the day though I've been feeling guilty and ashamed so I wanted to ask people outside of my social circle, reddit, am I a bad person for this?

"I’d been talking to a girl from a different town on Tinder for two weeks, she agreed to come over to my town. I knew beforehand she has mental issues because she’s talked about it. I have a history of it too so it’s something we bonded over. 

When she comes I realize she’s pretty scarred and I feel something I haven’t done before: an actual urge to take care of a person to make them feel comfortable and better. She’s very open about herself with me and I’m happy that she trusts me enough to be so.

"I really understand the feeling and it honestly hurts so much. For me, it's a mix of pain and then a weird desperate hope that the issue wasn't with me and they'll return again eventually.

It's weird, I'm having a very similar experience to you. I was talking to a guy off a dating app for a week, he even said himself he felt we had a really strong connection and wanted to go on a date. We texted consistently, he told me how excited he was to spend time with me, I was beyond excited. He was sweet and funny and charming, I hadn't ever been that excited for a first date. We made plans for him to pick me up at 4:30 the next, continue texting and then said goodnight. That was two days ago and he hasn't texted me since. I texted a good morning, then asked how work was going, then asked if we were still on and then, just because I'm extra fucking pathetic sent two more texts, one asking if he was alright and still interested in going on a date and then one a couple hours later saying that I really enjoyed talking to him and how sweet and charming he was and that I would be here if he ever wanted to talk again. How pathetic is that lol. It just hurt me and confused me so deeply that he would be so excited to go on a date and then literally just.. stone wall. Nothing. I don't know what I did or said wrong. I already have bad self esteem and shit so this really just wounded me deeply, it's not something I can just easily glance off like other people. 

I know for other people getting ghosted after or even before a first date is nothing, they just brush it off and basically forget it but I've never been that type of person. I really wish I could be"	ExplanationSenior535	reply	na	na	na	0.9985509514808655	weak	strong	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.

"i (22f) cannot stand being around some of my friends in public, and it makes me feel so sad and guilty. 

a few of my friends are just so ignorant to social cues, and when i try to gently point them out, they brush it off or get mad at me. i understand that, since i know i would probably get defensive too. but they never change their behavior, and i feel really conflicted because i don't want to give up these friendships, but it makes me so uncomfortable to be around them. 

i have some social anxiety, and have worked hard over the course of my life to learn how to fit in and not draw attention to myself. that's a personal choice, and i don't expect any of my friends to do that if they don't want to, but it makes me so anxious to be around someone who is, for example, talking loudly in a movie theatre or singing to themself at a fancy restaurant. i honestly feel like the parent of an adult toddler sometimes, because i either have to tell them to stop (which upsets them), or deal with people staring and being bothered by them. 

i know the easy answer is to either stop being friends with them or get over it, but i've tried so hard to get over it and i just can't, and cutting them off isn't an option. they are like family and mean so much to me, and the only time i have an issue with them is when we're in public. in private, there aren't any problems. 

i don't know what i'm looking for here, i just wanted to say it somewhere since i can't say it to them. if anyone has advice it's very welcome."	Accomplished-Gear418	post	29.75483360105346	female	White	0.9984517097473145	na	na	na	1	offmychest	failed

Regret is hitting me like a bullet over the missed visits, missed calls or texts. I feel like time stopped. I feel like tomorrow I’ll see him again or he’ll text me but it never comes. All the RIP messages are making me come to reality that he’s gone.

"I understand that things happen in your life and there is nothing you can do about it, and its best to accept that these things happen and try to live the best life you can, and I will. Except if there is one thing, I can tell you I hate more than anything it's my skin color, I truly despise being black.

Most people will tell you should be proud of your skin color and where you came from, but I'm not. I truly hate everything about being black, it has caused me nothing but trouble and has never benefited me in the slightest. 

Everyone one of my friends are white and most people I around are white, I constantly feel like I'm judged and treated differently for the color of my skin. Blatant racism and racist remarks are all common, and I'm constantly treated differently for my skin color. Teachers look at me weird and assume things about me because of my skin, even my best friend's other friends and family treat me like I don't exist and make fun of my dark complexion.

I truly feel that every aspect of my life leading up to this point would be a lot better if I were white. 'wouldn't have very dark skin and short curly hair that won't grow, the white girls in my school wouldn't try to avoid me in the hallway or give me dirty looks, my friends great grandmother would acknowledge when I came in, and people wouldn't assume i stole something when it goes missing or call me a big scary black man.

"I'm a black female too and it hurts to read this but I see where you're coming from. I'm in my early 20s but I remember being in high school and having my crush or guys in high school telling me I'm not as pretty as the other girls. Mind you, the school I went to was mainly white and I was maybe 6 of the black girls in my grade out of a 130 kids in my grade. 

The only thing that keeps me going is to prove them wrong. Don't change yourself but I've always kinda had different interests than stereotypical ""black people"". I don't really like rap music, I prefer EDM or rock/ metal. I'm well spoken and am confident in what I do. 

I know being a man is different but the whole world 🌎 or even the whole USA is not like your school. After high school look into going to a Historically black university. 

 Some areas have people that think making little ""jokes"" with racist undertones are cool, funny or trendy. When someone makes a joke,  I throw one back at them. 
Example: if they say something like ""oh you like chicken, don't you? ""
I'd respond, ""actually no. Im a vegetarian (which is true) but if I did eat chicken I probably wouldn't like the chicken you make. Cause we all know you wouldn't season it properly. ""

Just kinda correct them and throw a joke back their way and see how they respond. If they just laugh it off, it's w.e and is for the most part just a joke. 
If they get angry and defensive, that's time to re-evaluate your friendship with these people or have a serious conversation on how either joke isn't funny and how their uncomfortably with the joke is exactly how you feel when they say it. 

Also, if you ever have the chance to travel outside of your state or better yet outside of the USA you'll see that the whole world isn't like this. Not every country is so race divided. 

I hope my answer helps and that you get more comfortable in your skin. Being a black man also helps at least you don't have to pay a lot of money like me to keep a weave on my head so I actually look like a female, unlike if I wore my hair wet and natural.

"My best friend in high school moved away. She gave me her number to keep in touch, but she never responded to my first text message to her.

My second best friend in high school turned out to be an online sexual predator who groomed me for 2 years.

Had a best friend during the pandemic. Out of the blue, he groped my chest without my consent, then went on a nice guy rant about how much he ""loved me all this time"" after I refused to do anything sexual with him.

I reconnected with a group of people I knew from high school and we became good friends. I found out there was a guy in this group who remained close friends with my r-pist. Everyone in this group knew I was assaulted and the identity of the attacker. He was unwilling to end his friendship with the r-pist. My friends also did not want to cut out this mutual friend, so I left instead, not wanting to associate with people who sided with someone who supported my r-pist.

On that note, I had previously tried to maintain a friendship with an ex because the split was relatively amicable. He was the one who ended up assaulting me.

Got ghosted by two close friends. One was my roommate and best friend in college. We kept in touch throughout the pandemic, albeit not as frequently as before when we were living together because I had to move out of state. The last time I messaged her was this spring. I asked how she was doing. No response to this day. I was also the one who initiated most conversations with her, so maybe I should have seen it coming.

The other was a girl I'd known since elementary school, and we reconnected earlier this year. She and I both had a falling out with our original friend group, and it seemed like we were on track to rekindling our friendship. She took me out to lunch for my birthday, and I was looking forward to celebrating her birthday with her to return the favor. She was a sparse texter, but she always got back to me. Until one day, a few days before her birthday, it was just radio silence. It’s been quiet ever since.

I feel like I should give leeway to the second friend because she was legitimately very busy in school. However it still hurts that I bought her a birthday present, and it's just collecting dust in my closet. Didn't even respond to my last message asking if I can leave her present at her mom's house.

I befriended a classmate who later traced one of my comics for her own assignment, then later put that traced comic in her professional portfolio. Never asked for permission or let me know she did that. I found out by pure luck.

Made a friend who seemed genuine at first, but he revealed a possessive and vindictive nature as time went on. We were running a club at college, and he was very cold when I brought my boyfriend to one of the club meetups. (Even telling me I wasn't allowed to bring him.) He got very petty towards me as soon as I wasn't willing to do everything he asked me to do.

I confided in a coworker who became my friend about the previous friend's behavior towards me. He thanked me for being honest with him, but he still chose to remain friends with them.

I'm afraid to make new friends because I feel like they're either going to inevitably leave, add a lot of stress into my life, or treat me horribly. Is it possible to meet someone I can have a relatively normal friendship with? I don't know why friendships are seen as this wonderful, fulfilling part of life. Some of the worst moments in my life have been caused by so-called ""friends."""	kaylintendo	post	22.401573569097778	male	White	0.998566210269928	na	na	na	1	offmychest	no prediction.

It sucks to have someone that you're used to texting, calling, hanging out with every day suddenly dissappear. 😕 I'm sorry for your loss but just try to remember that he's still here, just not on the same plane as us.

"I (18)F have known for about a year or so, that nothing fits into my vagina. When my only option was a tampon during a period I got randomly at school. I knew how to put one in but I had never done it before. Once it got two centimeters in, it felt like fire. Like if I had gone any further I would’ve split open. I know that’s a difficult image. 
But that’s how it felt.
 I remembered seeing the TV Show : Sex education. There was a character with a condition known as Vaginismus. I googled it and I felt as though my symptoms were the same. I went to the doctor and they said they needed to properly check with OB/GYN before we know fully, but it did sound like I have it. I never checked, my parents never let me go to the doctor alone, or anywhere alone. Now I might be able to but I still don’t know, I’m scared it’ll hurt when they examine me.
 I have a boyfriend and he respects my body enough to not ask for full sex. We express that we want it, but I know it will hurt. 
I want to have vaginal sex, but the pain I felt when trying to masturbate and when putting in that tampon, I can’t do it. Masturbating is so difficult. Whenever I have sex, it’s usually just oral, me pretending I like what I feel because I can only feel pain. I want it but I can’t have it. I do things for my boyfriend so he can feel good. I love him and I want him to enjoy our times together. But I wish I could enjoy it just as well. 
I’ve only ever expressed to him that vaginal sex will hurt, I never expressed that when anything including my own hand touching me can hurt. The best I have is a vibrator that only stays outside. But because of my parents and I living in a small apartment, I rarely use it. 

I don’t wanna live the rest of my life like this, but I don’t wanna continue telling my boyfriend that it feels good when in reality I feel nothing but discomfort. Even with myself.


Edit : I’m talking to my boyfriend about it now and I’ve made an appointment to see an OB/GYN, the only available spot was two months from now but I’ll do research until then

"I’ve had a partner with vaginismus. There’s two things the doctors can try; one is a gel that relaxes the muscles, the other is a set of increasingly long and girthy dildos to “train” the muscles to allow things in. These start smaller than a tampon and go up in size. 

You need to see the dr about this.

Also it sounds like you’re a really considerate girlfriend, so don’t feel bad for your boyfriend. A lot of women with sexual disorders don’t feel the need to satisfy their partners if they themselves can’t engage or enjoy. Your boyfriend is lucky that you’re still considering his needs 🙂

"Hey I have Vaginismus, you should definitely talk to an ob/gyn, there is physical therapy you can go through for this condition. 
It absolutely sucks but it’s not something that completely blocks off sex forever. I would encourage you and your partner to go slow, work your way up. You wont be able to do full insertion in one night, but work yourself up over a few weeks, it really helps if you have an understanding partner. Start with a finger (the first few times are going to hurt, but try your best to just focus on relaxing) don’t push yourself too much it will become a bit easier over time and then you can work your way through more. 
It’s not an easy journey but it’s not impossible you just need to be patient with yourself, if you get stuck in negative feedback it will make it worse and then you’ll have even more trauma attached to it, trust yourself and your partner and go at a pace that feels right for you.

Please don’t continue to have sex with him if it’s uncomfortable or especially if it hurts because if it is vaginismus that can make it worse.

Tbh you might not actually have vaginismus. It’s entirely possible, if you haven’t had sex before, that your hymen is simply a different shape. Typically, it’s like a donut or a horseshoe, buuuut that circle of thin membrane can also sometimes completely or partially block the hole. Some women have a sealed vagina, but it’s full of holes big enough to let period blood through, or they might have two medium sized holes, one large enough to fit a tampon but nothing bigger. It’s entirely possible you could have something like this, in which case a gyno could recommend to have you get it surgically altered, which once done will leave you perfectly fine.

We got together and I am, let’s say above average down there, and we got to a point where she is the best sex partner I’ve ever had, full penetration included and she orgasms each time.

How we got there? Well for a starter you need the right partner, someone who really really likes you and respects you, and who is equally concerned about your pleasure as he is with his. 

I advised her to masturbate while we were make in out and with time we introduced toys.

You need to see your OBGYN; they’re professionals and won’t do anything to you that causes unnecessary discomfort. I also highly recommend dilators. I work in LGBTQ+ health services, and the hospital at which I work provides dilators to transfeminine people who undergo full-depth vaginoplasty.

Additional to vaginismus you can also have something called rigid hymen. Go to a doctor that specialises in this area and they will tell you if you have that.

- Have you tried anal yet? That might help until you can get your vaginismus sorted. You might enjoy it, so long as there's tons of foreplay and your partner isn't rushing to get inside of you before things have relaxed down there. 🤷🏽‍♂️

- Pelvic floor therapists can really help.

- I know it's gotta be really scary to think about the pain of having an exam, but if you try and remember that your case isn't unique to gynecologists and pelvic floor therapists, it'll be a lot easier for you to go through with it. Plus, the pain is temporary.

- Does clitoral stimulation during masturbation hurt, too? You don't need to get inside of your vagina to get an orgasm. I'm sure I'm not telling you anything you don't already know, here.

- Have you tried using a pelvic floor therapy kit? They have a manual therapy wand that vibrates, and graduated dilators. They're super helpful.

"I'm (24M) with my partner (23F) that has suffered with vaginismus and sometimes still pops up every now and then. We spent about a year trying to have sex and having her somethings shouting in pain which was not fun for her and we just end it there. 

After some research from her end and mine we thought why not try dilators that start from very small to very big. We spent months starting with the smallest dilators and somethings working up to the bigger ones once she felt comfortable. We made it fun and she still had a lot of fun and orgasmed by grinding on top of me.

Nowadays, 3 years later we no longer need the dilators and can just pop it in (unless right after period - she still experiences some pain) as long as it is wet inside. We rarely have any issues but even if there are its okay.

One thing that my partner suffered with the most is the psychological aspect to it and for some time it broke her but with her determination and my love and reassurance towards her helped her a lot.

"I have had a partner with this issue. She had been in therapy for a long time, and when we got together was convinced she would never be able to have sex that involved penetration - and that our sex life would suck because of it. None of that was true.

What it took for my partner was slowly, carefully building up trust when being intimate. I won't lie: it took a year, maybe more. But she ended up enjoying penetration more than any other woman I have been with. Our sex life would still have been great without it.

The first step is stop pretending to like things you don't like. If you do that, you will never be comfortable and never be able to relax, and that won't help at all (vaginismus means involuntary contraction of the vaginal muscles, often as a result of stressing out about past/expected pain/your perceived 'failure' in having sex). So don't focus on the things you do not enjoy, or feel you cannot do. Don't think you're lacking because of this. You're not. Focus on what you do enjoy: oral, fingers, whatever, that do not involve vaginal penetration. From your edit, it seems you're boyfriend is more than happy to do that with you. He sounds like a keeper. Once you're there, you can try to slowly build up, either by yourself or together (the dildo set has already been mentioned). Communication is key. Also, therapy might help you, even if it didn't help my partner. Everyone is different.

Before realizing I didn't have to be penetrated I had just 2 orgasms during sex (one with my ex fingering me and another with a guy who I had just met eating me out) now that I'm with my current partner, I don't see vaginal intercourse as real sex and masturbation and oral as just foreplay so I'm enjoying sex much more and have orgasms everytime I have sex

"dude, i don‘t have vaginismus but my problem is the same as yours. From experience:

1) the obgyn exam did hurt and was terrifying and I hated every minute of it. especially because I had to do them literally three times in the span of two months and two of the three were super not understanding. The third one was tho and that experince was pretty fine, if scary and painful. (I did take my boyfriend with me to hold my hand for the worst one and he was very pissed at the doctor on my behalf, that felt really good lol)

2) i was referred to a sex therapist who was the sweetest person on earth. she did nothing that even remotely hurt and suggested some exercises I could do. Amazing experience, would recommend. I only had one appointment there.

3) I got recommended dilators, which are medical dildos you buy as a set in differnet sizes. you start with the smallest and work your way up over how ever long this takes you. You can also just buy them online.

4) painless sex should absolutely be possible. Vagisnismus makes everything to do with your vagina hurt but your clitoris should be fine. If that is uncomfortable too you might have an additional problem or you need to do some more exploring. I‘m not an expert tho.

In my country, you don‘t need a diagnosis to see a specialist, at least if you pay for it yourself. since sexual therapy and the likes isn‘t included in your standard insurance here, I technically didn‘t need to go to any doctor before I went to the therapist.

I second PT. 1000% physical therapy, OP. It is hard with vaginismus, but if you have a knowledgeable and compassionate therapist then they will help you get through it and go at a pace that is manageable for you. There are also pelvic floor exercises and stretches you can do to help stretch the muscles, along with diaphragmatic breathing. I went through the same thing and now I am able to have PIV sex after stretching and with the help of lube! I’m even pregnant now after trying for years!

Took like 20 minutes at least and it hurt like fucking hell, I bled for weeks. Go see a doctor OP.	Airpod_Dust	reply	na	na	na	0.9980073571205139	no	strong	no	na	offmychest	failed
The hymen is real. It’s a band of skin within the entrance. It’s simply not a sign of virginity because it’s not supposed to actually be like a sealed cap on a jar of lamb sauce because unless one has a medical condition where it partially or fully covers the hole, it doesn’t always break.

One of my first girlfriends had this problem. So we did anal instead and after a while she preferred it. Not saying it's for everyone, not everyone can get to the point where it is extremely pleasurable.	Airpod_Dust	reply	na	na	na	0.9980073571205139	no	strong	no	na	offmychest	failed
"I have a friend that kind of realized she had vaginismus when she got a boyfriend and started having (or rather trying to have) sex - she was describing the sensation as extremely excruciating pain. Few months into this she decided (yes, it was her decision) to try anal and later said it went very smoothly from the beginning, and on her third time she found a position that actually allows her to get an orgasm and her comment was like ""If things should be like this, it feels good enough for me to keep doing it like forever"". Plot twist - after year and a half into this they tried to have vaginal again, in the same position they were using for anal, and actually it worked and they switched to having mostly vaginal later. She did not say to have any therapy or something and in general was too embarrassed to talk to her gynecologist about this issue."

in high school i had a friend who did freshman year. 🤦‍♀️ the reasoning had something to do with her being mormon, and i was so bewildered when she told me about it. but that’s such a weird and uncommon thing, and tbh if i didn’t know someone who lost their anal virginity before having penetrative sex, i’d be convinced it never happens too	Airpod_Dust	reply	na	na	na	0.9980073571205139	no	strong	no	na	offmychest	failed

I need to post this again because I’m still struggling hardly.

Here’s the context (not a native speaker so pardon my bad English) :
I always knew I wasn’t normal and it was easy to guess because of what type of characters in Disney movies I was attracted to.
It kept going on as I watched more and more grown up movies.
I only had my eyes on abusive and toxic characters.
I started to have really dark fantasies really early and I discovered why the day my mom told me that I was SAed when I was a child.
Nobody knows what happened and who did it but both my doctor and my psychologist found big red flags and told my mom that they’re pretty sure something happened to me.
The reason why I don’t have any memory of it is apparently called traumatic amnesia.
But even though my memories are locked, it still impacted me a lot.
It shaped my relationship with people, especially men, my sexuality, I have nightmares almost every night and I learned to live with it, I have anxiety, suicidal thoughts, hyper sexuality, brain fog, panic attacks and other things.
Of course because of this, I wasn’t able to spot the other abuse I experienced later.
I mean, I knew it was bad, but I minimized it and I hated myself for “triggering” it or for “not defending myself enough” or for « secretly wanting it ».
I thought it was my fault, I should be less shy and stand up for myself, or maybe I gave the wrong signals.
I never told anybody when I was sexually assaulted, not even my best friend, or my sisters or my mom, even though I know my close family would have been supportive. But a lot of different reasons stop me from telling anybody.

Years later, after a lot of feminist talks in the medias and movements like #metoo, the way I was thinking was different.
One day I told about one of my SA to my male best friend, a story I forced my brain to forget for years, but I told him not like a secret I could finally get out of me, but like a funny story that happened to me.
And it stroke me hard when I went home.
I realized for the first time that it’s what we call rape and I was horrified.
I hated myself again, for not have said anything to anybody, for having fought more against him.
Why did I abandon my teenage self?
I still feel angry and sad about it, I did weird things like trying to find him on social medias, just to see what he became.

Anyway, after years and years of struggle with my relationships with men, I find an awesome man.
Love at first sight, respectful, communicative, great sex life. Of course we each have annoying sides but we’re pretty good at handling any problem we face. I love him. So much.

I thought that when my mom told me what happened to me the rape fantasies would stop.
I thought that if I experienced a sex-positive relationship with a respectful partner, the fantasies would stop.
I thought if I took care of my mental health, getting diagnosed, receiving the proper medication, the fantasies would stop.
Not only they never stopped, but they got bigger, more extreme, and more intense.
I was told different things by different people.
Some people told me to explore them with my husband, which would be my ideal scenario.
But my husband, as open minded as he is, and not vanilla at all, he is not into those fantasies and I refuse to push that kind of thing on anybody of course.
I thought maybe I should just read some fiction or watch some video and get over it.
But it’s still here and it feels like it’s obsessing me.
Recently it’s so intense that I struggle to work properly, and I even want to ask my husband if he would be ok to let me try it just once with somebody else.

I know that it’s pretty common for victim to have these fantasies.
But they’re not fantasies anymore and sometimes I’m almost scared to put myself in danger or worse, to put my marriage in danger.

My husband knows what happened to me, he feels sorry about it, but he’s not the kind of person who discuss about those things.
He’s supportive about me taking care of my mental health, but talking about those things is not really his thing.

People online keep telling me that it’s ok, a lot of people have these.
And it felt ok for a while, like a normal secret kink to have and enjoy in private. But it’s not ok anymore, it’s out of proportion now.
The rest of my life is going great, I’m starting ne project I like, my anxiety got better, my marriage is going well, talking to people got easier…
And I’m terrified to ruin all of this because I want something, that already destroyed me, to happen again.
How is that possible? What can I do? I never cheated on my husband but I did bad things to myself already and I don’t want to lose everything.

I feel horrible for saying that because I know that victims would never want that to happen again.
And I’m pretty sure that if it happened to me again it would be horrible.
So why does it feel like I want it? To the point to ruin my life?

A sick part of me is « proud » to be so « broken », like if it will make people like me better like that.
I had a therapist for a while to who I didn’t talk about that problem and o had to stop seeing them because of a lack of money.
I really don’t know what to do, should I keep getting off to it so it stops for a while? Should I try to ignore it again? But then how? I cry time it fails.

I realized that my coping mechanism is to fetishize things that could hurt me so I have the feeling that it’s what I want, what I like.
The reason why I started to try to get rid of these is my husband.
When I married him, for the first time, I wanted to lose that part of me so I could live a healthy and satisfying life with him.
I love him more than anything else, he knows about some of my fantasies but not the extent of it.
I don’t want to hurt him by doing something stupid that could harm me.
Because it’s sexually related I can’t talk about it to any of my friends, especially because they all know I’m a feminist and they would judge me so hard for having these fantasies.

I always thought it wasn’t a big deal because I would be the person harmed anyway so I’m not harming anybody, but now that I’m married, I just wish I was normal.
I just want to stop thinking about those things.
Or to learn how to accept them in a healthy way.
Anything that would prevent me being harmed and ruining my life."	ihaveanotherissue	post	20.441301677000904	female	White	0.01964208111166954	na	na	na	1	offmychest	no prediction.
I think you should talk to your husband about it, and the extent this something seriously impacting you and your day day to day life so talk about it and see if even just once in a while he wanted to help you fulfil these fantasies. Also talk to a therapist again if you can and be open this is clearly impacting you and a therapist can help you work through it so it doesn't impact you as much or even teach you coping mechanisms	ihaveanotherissue	reply	na	na	na	0.01964208111166954	weak	no	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.

"And what if everything works out great? 

Software engineering is a very easy career to start and find internships. If you are half decent, you’ll find a place. Most of hiring place don’t look for raw talent : they look for attitude and potential. 

Even if you are really bad, a lot of places are desperate. Also… consulting firms for gouvernement work will hire anybody because they can charge them trice what they pay them to the government. And it’s government work so… not much expected from you. Plenty of people start that way and gain experience and get better jobs after.

You’ll find plenty of opportunities to find work experience and get better.

"I wanna add that this story is complicated 
That I love her, and that she loves me, and that she has been broken for a long time before me 
She is the love of my life, we have been together for more than a year. I knew I wanted to marry her after 1 week, I thought I have got to marry you, I can’t loose you. 
But reality is sometimes stronger and her problems are stronger. 
She is suicidal, every little argument that we have turns into a big storm that makes her spiral down into this vortex of wanting to hurt herself and saying that nobody loves her. She has had numerous traumas, she has survived life 
And I love her, through all of these mental breakdowns I’ve stuck with her, I’ve reassured her, even when she treated me badly, even when she insulted me, because I knew that she was hurt and that I had hurt her even when it was something small, even when it was just misunderstandings. 
But this time is different. She accuses me of having lied about the past, about having said you are the love of my life to my past 2 exes already, that she doesn’t trust me and that she doesn’t understand why I lie on things from my past (and keeps pressing on telling me about my ex that has raped me) 
From the very start I wanted to be honest and clear but everything seemed to break her, everything made her doubt about her being special. 
She is the first one that I’ve ever loved and possibly ever will but I couldn’t tell her things that would have worsened her being suicidal, I couldn’t. She tells me that she would have accepted it when I know it isn’t true and that she would have spiralled down 
I myself do not remember most of the stuff of my past due to trauma and rape, and I do feel extremly uncomfortable when she asks about my ex and our love/sex life 
Not only, I had only been in relationships with men before discovering I’m a lesbian and that she is my first girlfriend and I have always been very clear on the fact that I had never truly loved before her
In our last fight she demanded to look through my phone, to which I said no because I thought it was a toxic behaviour that would have worsened her condition 
She said that if I did that it was because I was hiding stuff, that I shouldn’t have been trusted 
And proceeded to tell me and scream that she hated me and she found me disgusting 
How do I solve this? How can I make it work? I don’t want to loose her, and I’m loosing her. 

TLDR; Girlfriend that is suicidal demanded to look through my phone, said I was lying about my past (the importance I gave to other partners and other details) and insulted me heavily.

Leave her that’s just abusive. She will also cheat on you but guess what you’ll be in the wrong. And on top of that she’ll use suicide as a way to keep you from leaving. Leave now block her and report her to the authorities and tell them how shes using suicide as a method to get you to do things for her.

"Hey, I'm a 16-and-a-half-year old, and I've just moved to the US (California specifically) from Japan (city with about 1 million people) after living there for 2.5 years.

So, to put some background, I lived about half of my life in Hong Kong in an international school and was attending middle school until early 2021 when we suddenly had to move to Japan, where my mom is from. Dad moved to Calfiornia in late 2022. The move and subsequent stay in Japan completely destroyed me, and today I suffer from severe depression due to the experience. I basically had zero personal development and was messed up there, losing much of my contact with my friends and all, alongside failing to integrate with Japanese society. Today I feel like I'm still 14.5 years old, and am extremely scared of growing up. The moving kept getting delayed and my mom tried to make me integrate with Japan because she didn't know how long we would stay there for.

The general attitude of my parents tends to be that ""IT's only 2.5 years! When you grow up, you'll see it as a short part of your life!"". However, my feeling is that I must live my teenage years now, or I must die. I simply do not see growing up as an option at all until I've at least experienced what it's like to be a teenager. My parents' dismissal just doesn't seem to make any sense at all to me. 

We are thinking about starting me in 10th grade instead of 11th this fall due to all of these problems, but my age is a scourge on trying to experience anything as a teen anymore. I've heard the quote ""Children only have one childhood"". I feel like the same can be said for adolescence, and I just don't get the appeal of anything if I'm supposed to grow up. I suffer from a multitude of problems from that experience, and I do not understand how I'm supposed to grow up.

I literally have no idea what to do, and I just don't know how this isn't just going to go further downhill for me. 

What do you guys think?

As a side note, I am familiar with the instability that comes with moving around so much. And perhaps you are experiencing this as well. 

You have to start all over with making new friends and all. So, know that you are not alone in your anxieties. I can share with you what has helped me with this.

1. I have a small box of my favourite things. The things are small pieces like a dried up leaf or an acorn that I stole from the family of migratory woodpeckers atop the yellow post campsites near Big bear Lake - California!!! This is my box of familiarity. I collect a small (tiny) thing to remember happy moments by and see the changing of the country I'm in as a new adventure. The things in my box remind me that while the country and group of people might change, my adventures and curious, exploring self does not!  It is the constant!

2. The relationships I really, really like, I find ways to keep in touch.. it might be in the form of chat messages, video calls or even occasional handwritten letters and postcards to my favorite people all of whom are in different countries!

3. Wait.. you are in California!? It is my favourite place in the planet. Try to get to the outdoors if you can! Try to go asap!!!!! They make the mountains so accessible there. Try to see the redwoods and go camping!! You can see the Milky way sometimes! It's amazing!!

Also! In California, you might found some others in the same boat as you!!!! Other kids who have parents (that, due to their professional success have moved around a bunch). Try to see if you can find them! Cali usually attracts people from all over the world! I'm not saying it's perfect. Perhaps more like a Utopia /Dystopia. BUT, it absolutely is an excellent place to meet others who have experienced other cultures and even celebrate their existence. Please please try to go outdoors to the woods! I would have loved to have had that in my teens! I only got to know them in my late 20s and I feel like a little girl anytime I'm back in them!"

"Hi, I don't really know to use reddit or anything, sorry. 

I've been having a rough time with my boyfriend recently and I don't know what to do, but I need to get it off my chest. We've been together for about a year and a half now, and I love him so so much, but I feel like it's doomed. 

We're both in college living at his parent's house, and neither of us have a job. He does not enjoy working or school at all, and does not want much time apart from each other. (Widely different schedules, jobs, really anything that would mean I'd be leaving him to go do something for any real extended period of time.) I should mention as well that neither of us have a car and rely on public transportation or his parents for really anything unless we can get a ride from a friend. 

Really all of this current situation is just not how I've wanted or expected things to go. Anyways, I've been thinking more and feeling guilty about how much I rely on his parents and how much they've given me, and I wanted to get a job at a place that's going to open nearby. We've briefly talked about this topic before and I knew he wouldn't be happy about, it but I brought it up anyways. Also, I am a person that struggles greatly with setting boundaries or really holding my ground so I usually avoid confrontation at any cost, but I've been tired of him outright telling me I can't do things. Of course, he told me there was no way I was getting a job. He went through different reasons that I knew were bs or just to argue. Something he does when I want to do something he really doesn't like, is tell me to leave if I'm going to do it. Wtf?? I'd like to say, I did not want to move there in the first place. It was humiliating and degrading to me. He had been having issues with my family and it was tearing us all apart, I did it for him and for us. I really do feel terrible for what I put my family through.

 But now he's basically telling me that if I get a job, I'm not welcome. He doesn't want me there; I would be losing my home that I was almost forced into. Is getting a job really worth essentially ending the relationship in his eyes?? He said specifically that ""if your time is going to be wasted elsewhere at a job you should just leave."" I tried explaining how much I wanted to work and make money, for us and his parents. I explained that he would be busy with college anyways, so if we wouldn't be together in that time I may as well be working. He wasn't happy with any of it. He said he never wanted me to work, especially not if it wasn't some amazing high paying job. He just was not listening to logic, he didn't care. How can we have a future if we don't work? He didn't know. I was completely shocked and furious. He has no ideas or ambitions for the future other than his hobbies. I just don't even know where to begin with it all. How can I even start to work on this? 

It feels like there's so much to say, but I'm tired. He only cares about what pleases him right now, and he's angry if he can't have his way. I don't want to be the only one caring about our future and trying to live a normal life realistically. I'm also really sad to see any of this, that he really cares so little about what I actually want and feel and only cares if it's something that pleases him. I'm sad I don't know why he's acting this way or what he's thinking. I want to know his true reasoning. And I want to help. I care about him so much, I want his life to be good and see him being the great person I know he is. Or can be. I'm sad he doesn't want the best for us like I do. I'm just really sad about the state of my life I guess, I feel like we could both be so much better. 

Right now our relationship is affecting each other poorly instead of building us up into better people and I feel like I've failed as a partner. I know all of this, but I don't know what to do about it. Not everything is bad and we do have lots of great time together, he has done wonderful things for me and I truly believe he does love me. And I think that's what makes it hurt more. These problems are all an underlying issue and I've been feeling the resentment growing more over time, contemplating leaving or seriously telling him it's fucked up and I don't have to deal with what he's doing. Just thinking about it makes me feel so guilty and I hate myself for admitting any of this. But I've made a promise not to abandon him and I've decided to at least see it through, as I do kind of feel like our relationship is doomed as it stands. Maybe he'll grow up and mature, I'll just have to see. Haha I am very sentimental and I don't really talk to anybody about these sorts of things so I just had to get it out. I really do care for him, I wish he did for me the same way."	oopsshiddedandfarted	post	20.843352369570763	female	White	0.9986286163330078	na	na	na	1	offmychest	no prediction.

I absolutely don't overdo it and try not to make noise as to not cause a scene. But expressing my feelings and crying in public feels so fucking cathartic. Especially in front of young people my age. I don't give a shit if I'm a male, I almost died when I was younger. I've had people come up to me and ask if I'm ok. I usually say I'm not and walk away.

Emotions are normal. Emotions are human. Men are expected to not show emotion so it must feel especially cathartic in that way. Being proudly yourself and wearing your emotions outwardly is amazing!

"I have no friends or anyone I can talk to (in real life). Turns out, it's pretty easy to be left alone if you want it bad enough. I am currently in therapy. I'm hoping I can connect with anyone on this earth and that someone out there can relate to this and maybe we can become friends or find comfort that we're not alone and are allowed to say, THIS SUCKS.

I (29f) had a very happy childhood that I can remember vividly. Picture perfect in my eyes. I was/am very loved by two amazing people. When I turned 10 years old, that all changed and I remember this being the last time I knew what happiness and love felt like. 

My mom was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, depression, insomnia and she was an alcoholic on top  it it. A certain event in my moms life threw her into a spiral and the bad times began. All in about a year, she lost her job that she loved, her drivers license and truly, her mind. I don't know how else to describe living with a person with these illnesses other than it's terrifying. The saying, ""flipped like a switch"" is a freaking understatement man...

I was in constant turmoil. Always being yelled at for menial things. Even as a child, I knew something was wrong and this wasn't who my mom really was. I would try to walk away from her during fights and would be followed and cornered in my room. Nothing was mine, it was all hers. I quickly learned that asking nicely didn't make a difference and I started fighting back. Slamming doors, lots of ""I hate you, I hope you die"" fights, throwing every bottle of alcohol out onto the driveway to try and make a point. So many years of relentless yelling, berating, negativity, just pure darkness resulted in me beginning to self harm at 13 and using drugs and alcohol by 15. No one else saw or heard what we did. We were prisoners in our own home. And I felt like I was going crazy. 

Eventually, my dad left her when my sister and I were finally adults and she was destroyed. She lost all of us and she didn't mean to. Distance helped our relationship and I was finally able to hang out with her alone and saw that she was trying. Still drinking the same, still received a lot of manic texts/voicemails, but she was really making an effort to be in my life again. I don't blame my mom for anything, I don't hate her. I just wished she wanted to help herself. 

I got a call from my dad while I was out one night and he said ""Mom is in the hospital, we need to go now"". When we got there, she was on a breathing machine. Couldn't hardly open her eyes. Obviously couldn't talk. Her skin was so yellow and her eyes...I was in shock. What followed the next few weeks were nothing short of traumatizing. I didn't know what ""Palliative care"" meant at the time. No one explained it to me. I truly thought my mom was going to get better and I was researching what foods are good for your liver and recipes I could make her for when she got to go home. Well, she did eventually get to go, but it was to pass away in the comfort of her own home. This all happened in a matter of a few months? I can't even remember anymore. It could've been less. Either way it wasn't enough time.

My mom passed away holding my hand and I went with her in that same breath. 

No closure. I never really got to tell her all the things I wanted to tell her. Writing it down doesn't make it less painful. I barely got to have a mom and it's not fair. So many unanswered questions. Advice she can't give me. I don't get to see her as an old lady with the ""salt and pepper"" hair she was so excited to have one day. She should still be here. She wasn't finished. My creator is gone, I don't know who I'm supposed to be without her.

My mom was incredibly beautiful, inside and out. She was talented beyond words. She gave people everything even when she had nothing. Always had a smile on her face. She had the coolest style ever and I always hoped one day I could fit her clothes. She had the best taste in music!! She truly LOVED life and went out of her way to make people smile. She cared about people and animals. She was a giver. She was a genuinely good person to her core. I often wonder what would she do or say in most situations I'm in? If my mom was here she would stand up for me, hug me, tell me funny stories, she would've taught me so many things about plants, gardening, music and art. She would be a fantastic grandma if I ever decide to have kids. She would've, could've, should've.

It's been almost 7 years and I haven't done anything of value with my life. My 20's were gone in the blink of an eye. I've dealt with depression my entire life and I don't even know what being happy is anymore. My dog is really the only thing that keeps me going, he needs me to stick around because he doesn't have thumbs. I am trying though, I don't want to be stuck under this cloud anymore. I make daily tributes to her in any way I can and it makes me feel close to her. I just wanted someone to know that she existed and her life mattered. She did a lot of good, despite all the bad and I'm grateful to be her daughter.

I've been on many different antidepressants since I was 19. Decided to go off of them 3 years ago and I feel exactly the same, only now I can cry. I think my problem is that due to having depression I isolated myself so severely that it's left me friendless. I have no one to talk to except my therapist.

"I honestly have been glued to my bed since college. I had a confusing roommate situation my freshman year and it went downhill from there.. I started going out with really bad people to party and found myself in a constant circle of bad friend groups and feeling lonely. I don’t know if this is just how my life is or if I have some type of condition that causes this. I just thought by now, being out of college for 3 years and out of my childhood home for 7, that I would be better. But somehow the problems just get bigger and my ability to cope with them is not great. I feel the crushing weight of my responsibilities and I do the same thing I’ve always done after my spirit was crushed by my parents and the world, which is crawl into bed. People are much nicer now or much more mean, but I can at least somewhat navigate that… and without blaming myself.

I don’t know how to get out of this cycle, but any negative interaction I have with someone outside of my house makes me want to run back inside and crawl into a hole. The issue is that the hole is getting bigger and the more I get sucked into it the worse off I am. I can’t handle even basic rejection from people. I have desensitized myself so much that I can actually pretend it’s not even happening. But the problem with that is not that it doesn’t matter, it actually matters a lot and too much. Because after years of chipping away at my self esteem, I am a shell of a person and have no identity. I’m afraid to move, breathe, think, act, speak, do anything. Because all of my life I would do those things wrong somehow. So I learned to just not exist. It is the most punishing experience and is needless to say the least. And rehashing the trauma by reaching out to the people who caused it has only made it worse. 

I am so misdirected in the mind it is going to take years of counseling and psychiatry to pull me out. So many failed relationships, friendships, jobs, endeavors. I either stop before things are finished, or… just that I stop before things are finished. Or I push people to the point where they have to walk away. I’m miserable but now I am at the point where people can start blaming it on me instead of my parents, but my parents never took the blame. In fact they somehow managed to blame my own abuse on me in my 20s… nothing makes sense."

"My fiancé Sid (25m) and I (23m) have been together for 5 years and engaged since January. Our wedding is set for the fall. I've always had a great and close relationship with my future in laws, Sid's mother is basically my best friend and his father has always made me feel like his own child, it was comforting being brought to this family considering I have a very dysfunctional family and a lack of real parental figures. I get along great with his older brother but not really with his sister Max (33f). Sid's mother has always told me stories about Max growing up and being a trouble maker. She has no job and not a great relationship with her parents because of her narcissistic behavior and sense of entitlement. I didn't want to judge her before I even met her so I was optimistic about meeting her and it went just how Sid's parents expected. I first met her after 2 years of dating Sid and she barely spoke to me and made snarky remarks about my major and about dating ""older guys"" even though were only 2 years apart. She even went as far as to compare my parents to her and how they're stable enough to actually take care of their kids instead of selling drugs. She was told to leave and I just sat there speechless while Sid and his family apologized profusely. I never saw her again until our engagement and we threw a nice party even though she didn't speak to me, which I truly didn't care about as long as she wasn't directly targeting me. 

Since the engagement, my future mother in law has taken me dress shopping with her sisters and Sid's cousins and it has been nothing but wonderful and even paid for the dress which I cried about for hours being so overwhelmed by the love I never received from my own family. Last week, we had dinner at Sid's house when Max came to the house uninvited and unannounced. We all looked at each other in confusing trying to figure out who might have invited her, but we know that nobody would subject themselves to dealing with her. While we were eating dinner, we were all talking about the wedding and mother in law brought up how beautiful the dress and how she's so excited to see me walk down the aisle. Father in law asked who was walking me down the aisle to which I responded that I planned to walk alone because I hardly had any male figures in my life that I'd be willing to let me walk down the aisle let alone have a lot of family that were even coming to the wedding. Father in law went on to talk about how it would break his heart to see me walk down the aisle alone and how he values tradition that no bride should walk alone to which he proceeded to say that he'd be willing to walk me down the aisle. I was about to start breaking down into happy tears when Max suddenly stood up slamming the table and storming upstairs. We all looked at each other in shock. Mother in law went after her where Max proceeded to scream that rang through the whole house. She screamed that I didn't deserve this opportunity let alone deserve to be anywhere near her brother and how I took away her opportunity for her father to do that at her own wedding. Sid stood up and led me out the door back to the car where we drove back in complete silence. Mother in law texted me that she's so sorry for the way she acted as well as father in law who apologized for the bad timing of telling me his plans. 

After this who fiasco, I've been thinking about what Sid's father told me about the wedding and as much as I really want to accept, I'm having seconds thoughts about Max and her reaction. Sid wants to completely uninvite her from the wedding because he's afraid she's gonna make a scene, but my brain feels like it was put in a blender and am having a hard time even comprehending what I even want to do. As much as I want to reach out to Max and talk it out, I'm at a loss for words and am really confused on what to do.

"Sounds like Max is insecure about her place in her parents' lives and probably feels like she's being replaced when Sid's dad offered to walk you down the aisle. Max is taking out her hurt on you and wants to make you feel bad about yourself so she can feel better. She's acting like a petulant child rather than a grown ass adult. I know it's probably hard for her to not be an asshole since she sees her face in the mirror on a regular basis.

I agree with Sid that Max needs to be uninvited to the wedding as she's been mean-spirited from the get-go; disrespected you; tried to undermine your relationship with your in laws; etc. Cut the rot from the tree and call it a day. Just because someone's family doesn't mean you're obligated to give them access to you. You'll have a more peaceful relationship with Sid and his family if you guys go No Contact with Max."

"My son is 8 and he has autism. We have therapists and support workers and he goes to a main stream school.  He is happy and confident and loves going there.

Today, another call from school - he was playing a game with some classmates and one of them got upset. He wanted to continue the game without them and a teacher pulled him up and told him off for not being a better friend.  Because he argued they have decided that he can't be trusted to listen to teachers so can no longer do school field trips unless we take him ourselves.

My son has never been invited to a birthday party or a play date. Every day at school pick up I hear kids say mean things about him. He ignores them. He got hit once, on purpose, he said they told him it was a game.  It's fine for other kids to be mean with intent, but his not understanding social cues make it ok to bully and exclude him.

My son may never get married or even have a partner, may never have kids, may never even get a job he loves because at 8 years old he is already written off.

I'm exhausted trying to defend my son, I'm exhausted trying to teach him that the world is a kind place,  that you help people and you care and it comes back to you...it doesn't. 

The outcomes for a child with his condition are not great, he has genetic factors that are life limiting. Iwill.likely outlive him. I want him to know he is loved, safe, that we see how funny and kind and smart he is. But the second we go out the front door people don't care, or it's too hard, or they are just mean.

I failed as a mother before I even began. It's utterly lonely and I don't think I will ever forgive myself. No matter. How hard I try, no matter how much I advocate for him. I can't fix the world."

"Im going to wade in and probably open a whole can of worms... but

I assume the school knows about your sons condition?  (If not then thats the place to start).  

I would start with requesting a face to face meeting with the school principal.  I would 'drop' in the phrase ""discriminated against"" when you repeat what happened with your son being stopped from playing by another teacher.  I would also ask what special considerations and support plans the school have implemented to assist with your son intergrating into a normal environment? 

You have not failed as a mother - it sounds like you're doing a great job (yeah its not easy) But you're a fantastic pillar of support,  You just need to continue to fight the systsm, the injustice and the mean-ness.

"Thank you for your kindness local_laddie

My son's school are aware. He has a special education plan, a class aide and two of his therapists (speech &OT) do sessions in school as well (at our cost) so that his teachers are up to date with his development and progress, understand what tools and resources we are using at home etc. We have invested money in a hearing loop system for him as well (around $2000) so he can hear better in class - it's been helping lots to keep him in task in class.

A lot of my sadness and frustration comes I think from seeing that no amount of support, training or awareness changes the fact that sometimes it's easier to be mean, oblivious or indifferent. The school is a microcosm, when he is out in the big wide world it won't be easier. It's daunting to have to prepare him for that."

"Started with my husband, he was diagnosed with a very rare form of cancer about 18 months ago. We started chemotherapy and it was haulted due to a so called “mis diagnosis” by the hospital we had insurance with. To go from, your husband has a very rare form of cancer to, we made a mistake was very bitter sweet. The bitter portion was what we had gone thru, the sweet obviously was the “your husband does not have cancer” words via his physician. 

A couple months go by and surgery is finally on the books. He has surgery yet unfortunately after the full tumor was biopsied it was proven to be even more rare cancer then before. We where heart broken due to the new diagnosis which would include more chemotherapy and radiation this time around. Having to shave the hair twice with your child in toe was beyond difficult. I hate that hospital for fucking up. They rode us like a horse at the circus. 

During this time our son (6M) took everything so hard. The one thing just as bad as seeing your partner suffer physically/mentally is also having to endure your young son succum to the hardships of thier parents. Mentally struggling, and pretty much stays home due to the weakened immune system of their Father not risking sickness via day care and social interaction with kids his age. A combination of the COVID years and the last 18 months of this rollercoaster ride has taken his happiness. Don’t get me wrong, he is still very happy but I cannot help but see a change in who is fundamentally since the first diagnosis. 

Then my Mother moved in with us. I love my Mom but living with her while taking care off your sick SO was difficult to say the least. I want to make sure my Mother is included in our new “family” but also comfortable yet my Husband is my first priority especially during bouts of chemotherapy/radiation and of course my son who is watching his Father deteriorate more and more each day. This was my burden, wanting to love my Mother everyday as she deserves (widow due to cancer and three time cancer survivor herself) but also take care of my now immediate family (my SO and Son). 

Then there is me, I am not depressed becasue I have no time to be depressed. I have lost my vigor for friendship, I have lost my overall sense of happiness but my family needs me and “me” is the rock that I have always been. Mentally I am there, solid and aware. Physically I am in the worst possible shape I have ever been. Financially we have never been worse, and it is beginning to hurt our marriage. Just the overall hits we have been taking has been horrendous and to top it off the scan that we have every 3 months to ensure the cancer will not return is no way to live. It’s like living every day with a cloud looming over your head. 

Then to top it off our financial advisor took us for a ride totaling 60k. We could have really used that money now, it was all my fault for trusting someone who I thought was a dear friend. The asshole is imprisoned now but I wish he could just make us whole again as he pretty much wiped out our entire life savings. 

This all haunts me like an invisible ghost where ever I go, it’s a GHOST becasue the only person who can see it is me. I feel like that kid from the Sixth Sense.

"I've been with my partner for nearly 15 years. We started dating as teens and moved in together at 18. At 23 we broke up foe almost a year to ""find ourselves"" and find myself I did. It was a lonely time but I made an effort to enjoy it at least some of the time. I fell into a routine of joyful peace and loved doing things just for the sake of my own enjoyment.

Eventually we got back together and while our relationship was stronger, there is a part of me that looks back on that time alone and misses it.

I feel like now when I cook meals I'm always thinking about what my partner would like and that I should make some for them. This is sometimes a joyful act of love but sometimes I'm just tired and don't want thr extra effort. I miss only cleaning up my own messes. I miss cleaning something and it starting clean unless I make a mess. I miss not having to be considerate of another person 100% of the time.

Don't get me wrong. I love my partner. They are my person though and through and if I could go back and do it over again I would, but I think a part of me will always miss living by myself and only for myself. My partner works from home and never goes out on their own so I basically never get a moment purely for myself (even work and my commute to work is often full of social interactions).

"hi so my best friend let’s call her M, have been friends for at least a year now or was. bit of backstory i was talking with this guy. call him gabe for a few weeks. i told him i liked him BUT i wasn’t ready for a relationship at all. he said he would wait for me. i told him he didn’t have to. he said he liked me a lot and he would wait..i hung out with him one on one and went to a bar to meet with our friend group. he has done and said some things that had made me uncomfortable. for example he already said i love you. he had said things about moving in with each other / having a baby and being married. he would tried to hold my hand or touch my waist. i would say pls dont my touch me or i’m not an affectionate person, and i don’t like to be touched specially when i’m sweating from dancing. he would continue doing this. i decided to end things with him and told him that we aren’t on the same page and i’m still healing from my past relationship, and he wasn’t respecting my boundaries. M decided to text me telling me she done with our friendship because i lead gabe(she is friends with him)this in her words. “you led him on by saying your feelings which isn’t okay and i’m done being friends with you and i feel like you still need to heal from your ex since he hurt you alot and you need let it go” 
 i’m so confused i’m literally taking therapy and i’m trying to heal from what i went through that’s why i didn’t want to get into a relationship yet at all??

"We live together and he has hit me multiple times before so there’s that. But tonight I just feel like I’ve hit my last straw. He woke up to use the bathroom when I was abt to go to bed and complained about it being hot. He turned the air down and asked should he turn the ceiling fan up. I said yeah and I’m sure it will cool down in a minute with the air turned down (I am always having to coddle him in these ways because when he complains it is very very abrasive; he acts like he is dying). He takes it the wrong way? Not even sure how and says I was telling him not to turn the ceiling fan up. So fucking stupid like who even argues abt petty shit like this? And I said no I was just saying it will cool down now that the air is down.

I walk away to throw away a water bottle not realizing he is still talking to me and he first rips my David Bowie canvas art off the wall and then gets angrier that I walked away while he was talking (again didn’t hear him) and throws my deodorant, making it go literally everywhere, I am still finding pieces of it. He tells me “you smell like shit anyway you don’t need it” and just shouting all types of obscenities at me for what I feel is literally no reason. I try to defend myself and say I didn’t mean it like that or to walk away and he just gets more mad, then half-ass cleans the deodorant mess up, slams our mirrored closet super hard (he obviously has no respect for our apt or our things which really really irks me because we are far from rich). 

I truly feel stuck in this relationship and it scares me sometimes. It is good most of the time but shit like this makes me want to just disappear. His friends are always so nice to me I sometimes fantasize about being with them. I also lost my stable $18/hr job and am now waiting tables and am more dependent on his income which fucking sucks. I am applying to jobs everyday but keep getting rejected. I just hate his behavior it scares me so much that I just went in the bathroom and cried for an hour until he went back to sleep.

"No but it is hard we have been together for nearly 8 years, what hurts the most is all the people we know think we’re just the perfect couple and also the financial part. I do have a college degree so serving is definitely not what I want to do, but what I have to do in the meantime until I find another job.

He always calls me pretty and stuff and things will go smoothly for weeks but then some bs like this happens and makes me question the relationship. I know it’s not healthy and is probably shortening my life span but I guess until I get another job I feel stuck. The one good thing is the car we share is in my name. But I can’t pay for it alone right now I don’t make enough anymore. But you’re right I get depressed when I think of having to deal with this for the rest of my goddamn life."

"I (18m) was sexually assaulted multiple times by my cousins in different occasions (26m and 28m) when I was 8 and they were 16 and 18. Hello everyone, I decided to tell you this story to get it off my chest. A bit of a backstory, my father is european and my mother is asian. Back in 2013 we went to my mother's country for a ""vacation"" that turned out to be an 8 year nightmare. There I met my extended family on my mother's side. Particularly my first cousin, let's call him Chris. Chris was the youngest of 2 siblings that were orphaned due to their mother being killed by their father and running away.

One day, he was babysitting me while my mum went to the casino to gamble. My other siblings went to my other cousin's house (not part of the story) to play with them. So I was left with him alone. I was playing with my tablet when he called me and told me to go to the bedroom because he is bored and wants to play a game. So as a naive 8 year old boy, I obliged.

He tells me to lay beside him so he can show me how to play this game. He taught me how to jerk off. A few moments later, he tells me to do the same for him. I said okay and did the same to him. 

One night, while we were sound asleep. He was laying beside me while my other siblings were in another bed, he started to sexually assault me. I woke up to a sharp pain, and him going full on me. I kept silent, thinking that he wanted to play at this late at night. This went on for a good 30 minutes where he finished and went back to sleep. This happened multiple times. 

I later discovered sex and realised that he was doing it to me. I questioned myself if I was gay and I was in denial, telling myself that I like women and I'm not gay. (I was bullied pretty early on for acting a bit feminine)

Now going to the other cousin. Let's call him Joe. He is my 2nd cousin and lived with my aunt while he was studying.

One day we went there for 3 days to visit them and so we met there. We played with my other cousins all day and when night fell and we went to sleep, I slept beside Joe.

I woke up to him feeling my butt while he takes my hand and puts it in his gentleman's area. I was afraid because he looked scary when we first met and so I remained silent and obliged at every motion he makes, he pushes me down, I go down. That went on the 2 nights that we were there. 

I was pretty traumatised and in denial because I am not gay, I like women. And so I kept it a secret.

3 years ago I left that one hell of a country to return back to the home country of my father. I was put on therapy but I didn't mention that I was sexually assaulted by Chris and Joe. And so I still bear the trauma right now.

I don't want to reveal it to my parents since they separated 6 years ago. Because I am alright at the moment. A few nights ago though, I accidentally overshared it with a friend and I kind off regret it but I couldn't help it. 

I feel a big weight off my chest has been relieved and I feel much better now. Thank you for reading."

"I (28F) finally told my mom about my cousin (22M at the time) trying/starting to molest me in my sleep when I was 14. I had been raped the year before and was still dealing with that trauma, so I just pushed it to the back of my head. I kept my distance and never said a word to anyone. 
I was so tired of everyone in my family giving my shit for cutting him out of my life and refusing to attend his wife's baby shower last month. I had to get it out.  It was rough. I learned that he had been kicked out of his parents' house for trying to molest a 12-year-old girl the year before he tried it with me. It's a pattern, and people need to know who he really is.  
I suspect that your cousins may be the same. 
Healing from sexual trauma is hard, but having a support system makes it easier. If you don't feel comfortable telling your parents, you should find someone else you can talk to about it.

""I (F21) met thi dude (M25) the first week of december, the following week after that we exchange numbers and we agreed to go out on friday, Everything is okay, we kissed each other and everything was cool. 

On sunday he came over to my place but we ended up talking inside his car for 2 hours. He said things like: How is it possible to a 20-year-old girl to have such an effect on me ? I want everything with you. I initially thought it was too much but I believed that he was just excited, I hope he is not the I-need-love type.

The next and last date we were watching some movies at his apartment, I was not thinking about do -something- more, so fine. This guy was calm, he never touched me if I didn't want to, he respect my personal space. Even I could say he was kind of sweet, like cute and all but always very respectful because I had told him I'm not very into physical contact stuff.

Once the movie was over we talked for a bit, then we kissed each other again for 2 or 3 minutes, everything was heating up and I barely sat on him, he grabbed my boobs and the next second he let out a groan and told me: -I think I just cum on my jeans-. I was shocked out.

Then he said if I would like to have dinner with him (it was around midnight or 1am) and I said yes because I wanted to get out there ASAP but still hungry.

"*TLDR: You can be yourself and still have amazing things happen for you.*


I can’t announce IRL yet because my current job needs a few more days to get their ducks in a row so here goes.

 

A week ago, I received an email from a recruiter at a company in search of someone to fill an accounting position. I’m gainfully employed where I am, very comfortable and content, I have made many lifelong friends here, including my manager, so I haven’t been looking and I nearly deleted the email… until I saw the salary was way higher than what I’m currently making.

 

I agreed to a phone interview, because what’s the worst that can happen? I did my research too, because I’ve been taught that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. But they have overwhelmingly good reviews on sites like Glassdoor, Indeed, etc. They’ve also been in business for 120+ years with a very high retention rate, another good sign.

 

The phone interview went very well, and I barely had to sell myself to them. I guess my resume spoke for itself. So instead, they wete trying to sell themselves to *me*.


I ask why the spot is vacant (bracing for some BS answer), turns out they had someone retire after spending 40 years with them. Okay, another good sign.

 

A day later, I’m asked for a 2nd interview over Zoom. Fine, I thought, but I’m going into this as myself to see if they still want me. Again, gainfully employed, nothing to lose. You may ask, who is “myself”? Well myself is a 30 year old goth woman, dressed head-to-toe in black, dark makeup, tattoos and piercing proudly on display. My current job, where I have just under 10 years of tenure, knows who I am and fully embraces me… turns out this place does too.

 

The Zoom interview with the CFO & accounting manager went for over 2 hours because the conversation was going so well. They invite me out to lunch THAT AFTERNOON for an in person interview (the CFO said “We already want you, this is just a formality.”) and I’m offered the job with an additional $5k tacked onto the already amazing salary and a $2k sign-on bonus, but wait, there’s more: I’m immediately entitled to monthly profit sharing, ESOP, and annual performance bonuses as an incentive. **BUT WAIT,** there’s even more, they offered to match the amount of PTO my current company is giving me (after ~10 years, you rack up a lot) and they’ll honor the days off I already had scheduled. I get to pick my hours and I’m able to WFH as much as I want after training.


I’ve also seen my new office and it’s beautiful.

 

Having a CFO shake your tattooed hand and tell you that you’re a “Rockstar candidate” who can “revolutionize” the accounting and finance team and that they appreciate your authenticity? Indescribable feeling.

 

I start in 3 weeks. I am in heaven. After being told by conservative family members I’m trash and “good luck getting a job with *all that*” I’m making more money than they could ever dream of. SUCK IT, GRANDMA.

 

Be yourself, kids.

"I'm so angry, I've known my parents were homophobic and transphobic from a young age. But I was blind to their racism because my father served a mostly African church (we're white). We lived in a mostly black town, and we live in a mostly Latino area now (but our congregation is yt). But now that I am an adult and especially after 2020 my eyes have been completely open to their behavior. Especially my mom, she says hateful and vile things towards people of other races, she said the N WORD! Just tonight she called my young neice who is half mexican only 'half bad"". My parents do not understand how they are racist. Even when I blatently call them out   


I warned my roommate of my parents racism already and they made the decision to call the school to see if they can move dorms becuase they may find it necessary. At first I was upset but like an hour later hearing possibly the most racist jokes thus far I agree. I have spoken to them and told them I'm not really going to invite them or even want them to come up to visit at all, and I'm planning to hopefully cut them off. But that all depends especially if I get this job.   


And now I'm questioning if my roommate will be comfortable with ME if I choose to become a dispatcher for our campus police. But I can't cut my parents off if I don't. I need the money which is the only reason I'd do it.   


They have always made everyone around me (including myself) uncomfortable with their various forms of bigotry. I can not allow them to keep doing this.

Hi. I’ll be brief. 6 weeks ago i went on omegle after seeing a porn video that made me questioning about my sexuality. i met this guy. to summarise we jerked off and as the stupid teenager i am (18m) i showed my face, my d*ck and my ass. i realised i really don’t like guys and i feel so disgusted by myself. now i’m worried that the other person recorded it and posted somewhere. i’m freaking out and just the idea of the video going around makes me literally wanting to kill myself. i know i made a really stupid thing but i regret this so so much and i’m hoping my life won’t be ruined (i have a gf, she already knows the situation and we are working on it) but i’m so scared and since that day i’ve been browsing on a lot of porn websites (gays or not) looking for the video sorting different results from different keywords but nothing, i can’t find the video. i also tried alecto ai and pimeyes but nothing there too. i’m crying literally every hour and i feel i fucked my life and i don’t deserve to live anymore. i hate myself so so so much.

Only person I tell I love them, is my confidant(female). But to me loving someone means you want them in your life and trust them. Being in love with them means you desire intimacy (of all kinds... Soul mind body energy) and desire share life with them. Most don't believe way I do not experienced what I have to cause this.

"Simple as that. I truly hate myself. I ruin everything good that ever comes my way in life. I can’t keep a good relationship stable. My self hatred causes me to spiral and think my partner doesn’t actually love me. I drive my relationships to the ground. Because if i hate myself then my partner should too. The amount of stupid things I’ve done, or lashed out. All so i can be alone in the end.

I wish i had listened, i wish i had gotten back on my meds. I gave into my depression and self hatred when all you wanted was to lift me up. I should have fought for you like you deserved. I don’t have anything to care about anymore now. I even miss your family who teased and made fun of me everyday. I thought i hated them, now I realize i even miss them. I lost so much more than i thought i did. I was a part of a family that cared about me, and i felt like you all hated me. I miss sitting at the family dinners, hearing everyone joke and laugh. Even though i barely talked, i still had fun.

I think back on our talks about getting married and having children. How excited you were  at the thought of being a mother. I didn’t have that drive in me and now i do. And all i can think about is how we won’t have that family anymore. 

It just sucks. I know my problem, i wanted to be happy. But i couldn’t accept your love. Theres so much i wish i could take back. But you’re dating another woman now. Which gives me so many mixed feelings now. Im glad you’re happy, i just miss you…. Without you, i don’t care about getting better anymore. I just want to die, i hate myself for giving into my suicidal thoughts but they get stronger each day. I can’t love myself, I’ve done too much to ever forgive myself.

I (21f) was molested by my grandfather from 13-18 (he was around 82-87). My sister walked in on me having a mental breakdown about the abuse at 17 & my parents found out later that day. I had planned to never tell anyone b/c I didn't think anyone would believe me, I was right. My mum, a csa survivor herself, told me that it had only happened once, my dad told me later at 20yrs old that he only just then believed me, said that he had lied to me about telling my grandmother about what he did to me (which lead to me getting molested again at 18) & that she wouldn't have believed me if I did tell her. Everyone who knows has told me one way or another that I'm being ridiculous or that it wasn't that bad & to get over getting touched by a family member for 5yrs. I regret being exposed, I regret telling other people about what I went through, I wish no one but me knew, I wish I had been better at keeping everything to myself so that I don't have to deal with my past while simultaneously being shamed by others for the choices my traumatized childhood self made in an attempt to keep myself safe. I wish I could go back into the past & slap myself, that he would die in 3yrs & I would never have to deal w/ him again & I wouldn't stain his memory w/ what he did to me. I wish it had been my choice to tell my parents after I had been to therapy instead of them finding out & making everything worse. I wish, more than anything that people believed me instead of defending a dead man who killed the little girl who loved him.

And it took years for me to deal with.  But the more I talked about it the better I felt.  

First of all get some help. Therapy or support group.  Your not alone in this. F his memory.  He deserves the stain he was a monster.  What he did was monstrous.  Staying quiet helps HIM not you.  

In the years since I have found out he molested his own daughters. And molested nearly every woman in my family who was living at the time. My cousins   My aunt and likely my mother.  Staying quiet helped him get more victims.  Speak up.  You deserve this.  If all you can do for now is talk to the therapist then you should.  Get this poison out of you.

"I have made a similar post in the past, but this one will be more of a rant than an objective critique.
  

  
I hate this country. I hate the culture, I hate the tradition. I hate that people will be super angry with you and ostracize you if you do not participate in them. I hate a lot of the social norms here - they are just so outdated and pointless.
  

  
I hate that I can not make any friends here. Not that I am not social enough or have trouble approaching people. But people here are just so different. I have online friends from more progressive, open-minded countries in the west and I can get along with them well. But here, it is hard. It is not just general values that are very different, but the whole mindset and approach to things. It always feels very distant. Not to mention there are many things I can not talk about with people here.
  

  
I hate how xenophobic and racist this place is. People here think they are not racist, but then they go and use awful slurs for others, discriminate them and treat them like less. This applies to stuff like the LGBT too. ""I am not homophopbic, just do not shove it in my face"" aka ""I am fine unless I know you exist"". And it gets even worse in some cases, like when you are trans. Healthcare issues here aside, you pretty much can not go anywhere without being harassed. I can not remember the last time I was able to go somewhere and felt safe. Attacks are a bit more rare, sure, but it is hard anyway. (Though I did get assaulted several times just this year already). Not even talking about how dangerous it is to go anywhere during the night.
  

  
But even outside of that, all differences here are pretty much hated and discouraged.

I found out my boyfriend was jerking off to naked little girls around the age of 8-12yrs old. It was before we were together. He's was 25 years old at the time and did it for years beforehand. It wasn't a one time deal. I don’t know how long before because the history only went back so far. But it happened for at least 2 years that I know of. When I confronted him he says it hasn't happened since. How am I supposed to trust that? I was raped as a little girl by my brother and don't want to risk something like that happening to my baby if I have one. We've been together for 5 years and it feels like my whole world is crashing down.

She’s a virgin and I’m her first everything so I get it can be intimidating for her. But I’m tired of the same stuff sexually and want to progress forward. I feel bad for wanting it but also it’s not like she has religious or other believes holding her back when it comes to losing her virginity.

I had these same thoughts one and i actually changed to have a more aggressive personality and it was one of the biggest mistakes in my life. At first the anger helped people stopped bullying me but then the anger got worse and I would lash out on my friends and family and soon enough nobody wanted to be around me which made me more mad so I would take my anger out on people that didn’t deserve it. A few years later I realized that I had become a terrible person that nobody liked and some would stay away from out of fear and it was the worst thing ever so I went to therapy and still am I have some friends and have made amends with some of the people I hurt but I’m still working on myself to fix a mistake I made so many years ago so please don’t become a anger person or switch off your empathy because in the long run you end up far worse then you ever where.

I (19F) had always seemed to function like a normal teen. By that I mean, I was always horny and thus wet. I would masturbate anywhere from 2-5 times a week. When I was 17 I went on birth control (only for periods, I’m a virgin) and I immediately stopped getting horny in general. I know that’s a common side effect. I’ve been off of birth control now for almost a year, and I feel horny, but I rarely and I mean rarely ever get actually wet. I can maybe count the number of times I’ve been wet in the past year on my hands, yet I know I’m turned on mentally. Often times, when I actually do get wet it’s when I’m with another person, usually making out. I feel like there’s just a disconnect between my brain and my body. I’ve spoken to the doctor about it and he hasn’t been much help other than “that’s not normal for someone your age, I’ll refer you to a gynaecologist” (that referral never went through, or I’ve never heard about it.. I plan to follow up eventually). Most recently, I was with a guy and I was super into him and he was giving me oral and I was really enjoying myself but I had to abruptly ask to switch because I knew I wasn’t getting wet enough and it would soon be very uncomfy. After I gave to him he wanted to give back to me and I fully declined because I was so insecure about how dry I was. Idk, I’m not looking for medical advice, I’d seek a doctor for that. More just in general looking to see if any other young women have experienced this and if they can shed light on their situations. I feel defunct.	ryannorth9999	post	34.757724521080654	male	White	0.9982218146324158	na	na	na	1	offmychest	no prediction.
"Hey, it's actually really common. The pills play a role in it, of course, because their residue can stay in your body for years and cause such problems, but there's another thing. I've also experienced it myself and heard about it from my ex-girlfriend as well as friends; you literally could've masturbated yourself dry. That sounds ridiculous, but it really happens. If it's a short time, it usually gets better by itself, but after so long you might want to give yourself a boost.
My advice: don't use any intimate cleaning stuff, stick to water and eventually some chamomile tea for any rashes or other outer area issues. Try a probiotic cream or gel and start using a high quality lube. It will give your body some rest and help it produce the right amount of secretion.
Wear cotton underwear and avoid string. If you can, sleep naked. It makes amazing things for your body too.

"My parents met at 18, and after breaking up a few times, finally got married when they were 20. They had me first at 23/22 (between their 23rd birthdays), and five other children later. 

And here I am, at 22 (and a half, next month), with exactly zero dates, zero dances, zero kisses, and zero matches. 

See, I'm on a Mormon dating app, since dating within the faith is much easier for a myriad of reasons (TIL about 42% of people actively view our faith unfavorably), and at this point, my standards have almost wholly evaporated: my age range for swipes is 18-26, and I'm swiping like on basically every girl that isn't noticeably overweight, even some who already have children of their own. The app actually lets you see all the profiles you've liked, and just since I started keeping track, I've liked about 202 different profiles, with roughly 124 of those in the past week alone. 

Before I answer how many matches I got, let's graph this as a binomial distribution, assuming a 5% chance of being liked by any given girl (i.e. 1 girl in 20 will swipe like on me, or for each girl one guy will be the only one liked out of twenty shown). With those chances, there's about a 50/50 chance that any given guy gets 10 or more matches, with the other 50% getting nine or less. Some extremely lucky guys- about one in 12,500- will even get 24 or more matches from a pool of 202 attempts with 5% odds. 

I got zero. The odds of that at this distribution are 1 in 31,611. You put 31,611 guys in a room and have them each like 202 profiles and I'm the *only one* without at least one match, statistically. Obviously, I'm not *this* cosmically unlucky, so something has to be actively causing girls to never like me. But my dating app pictures don't even include my glasses or facial hair, I'm about 5'11"" and 138 lbs., and I haven't put anything any girl- especially not a Mormon girl- should take issue with in my bio or any answers to other little questions, so I genuinely have no clue what's so wrong with me as to make me this entirely undesirable. 

In recent years, the ways people meet have been changing, and nowadays the number of relationships that begin online or through apps is over 50%. However, if you remove the aspects I don't have access to- neighbors, primary/secondary school (I moved out of my childhood state about two years back), and bars (we Mormons don't drink), dating apps/online dating actually shoots up to about 96% of what remains. So even if you ignore the fact that I'm *far* better at masking my autism and ADHD over the dating app than I am in person, my odds outside those mediums are 1/24th as good as my odds have been on the dating app- in other words, about 1 in 758,653, and once you consider that Dunbar's Number- the maximum number of close relationships the brain can even handle- is about 150, I can't meet nearly that many girls for... that's not even dating, that's just the chance of them *expressing interest,* we haven't even gotten into relationship-building yet and it's already borderline statistically impossible that I'll ever get married. 

And that sucks. Not only because of my own upbringing being something that I would want to give my own children and my parents' lives being very much a standard I want to meet myself, and not only because of my religious beliefs wherein marriage is *the* crowning ordinance above all others, but because being entirely alone for the rest of my life when I've already hated it for the last seven years or so (ever since I really got interested in having a girlfriend or getting a date or even just a dance) is a terrible thought that I dread more than anything else. I know it's absolutely my reality at this point, and I'm better off accepting that, but I really just can't bring myself to do it: I can't stop worrying about it and just be *content* with that."

I'm not getting any younger, and the longer I go without ever having had any romantic experience at all, the larger a red flag that mere fact becomes: any good reason for me to have had *nothing* by, say, 25, would be good reason to leave me alone, so leaving me alone becomes a no-brainer at that point, and that'll only exacerbate with time. I also want to have multiple children, but given the medical complications of pregnancy after age 35 and the fact that I'm almost certainly not going to be able to get a partner with a considerable age gap, I basically only have 13 years before I'm entirely out of luck, and with seven already spent trying, that means I'm already 1/3 the way to the deadline from when I started. Considering I don't even know what I'm going to do with the business degree that I already need to save up until 2025 to even afford to finish, it's almost safe to say I've already peaked as it is.

"Trigger warning, close call (accident). You may skip.

Had a lot of bad thoughts these past few weeks, tough day at work, no breaks sa sermon kahit pag uwi.

I was riding my bike kanina sa Coastal, way above speed limit kasi its ""throttle therapy"".

I know its toxic, pea-brain strat kesa to talk it out. Hindi lang ako comfortable na magkwento ulit. It felt good, until it didn't.

Cruising at 106, tulala without knowing na may bump sa right side ng kalsada if you are riding southbound and nakalagpas na ng toll.

Nagulat buong katawang lupa ko, my handlebar wobbled. I thought I'm a goner. Tried to control it, my left hand lost its grip and I throttled it while leaning backwards para hindi lumala yung wobbling.

Eventually I gained control ulit before going up the ramp papuntang Las Piñas-Bacoor and pulled over shortly. I was shaking pagbaba ng bike, took me 2 hours bago ako umalis ng rest area na yon.

Umuwi ako ng bahay ng maayos, hindi lumagpas ng 30 takbo ko after what happened kahit 4 AM at walang katao-tao sa kalsada.

"So basically in a nutshell, the story is, I had a 6 and a half years of relationship with my ex, who was my first long term gf. In the more than 6 years, we had the same group of friends, and we always went to the same places and shows of course to drink and stuff.

We broke up like 2 months ago because we just didn’t work anymore and were arguing everytime, and she tried to shittalk to  like all of my friends of mine, and most of them were successful, I lost many of my mates thanks to her. 

Since then, suprisingly (because I was never that guy who moves on quickly) I found another love, and we went together yesterday to a place to drink, not just the two of us, there were some people with us, who knows my ex. 
Guess what, my ex was there, she was not with our people, but during the night as she got drunk, she started to talk with the people I came to there, and started shittalking again, there was even one guy she was flirting to. 

I told my current gf that this was a little annoying, not because I care about what my ex does, but because with who. 

She didn’t understand me, and now she doesn’t want to talk to me since then, I feel 0% apprehension. 

Am I stupid because I told her that this is annoying to me? I feel completely shit, I feel like I ruined everything."	benccor_	post	19.996806122388328	male	White	0.999194324016571	na	na	na	3	offmychest	no prediction.

I'm so sorry you're going through this I know it must be taking a big tole on you. But there's billion of porn on the Internet including professional porn. And there's also deepfake ai porn that it very easy to make. If your photo got out i doubt anyone would care. If someone that knows you saw it, It could be a someone who looks like you, it could be ai or photoshop. And if it's someone you don't know I doubt they'd care either it's another random person like porn addicts see everyday, random people. When you think about it in the grand sceme of things, no one really cares enough and if you don't reply or if you block them they'll loose interest and have no reason to leak your photo.

"Starting off, ive had a lot of bad things happen in my life. Trauma, stalking, abuse for multiple years, and now im at the point in my life where I will probably soon have no one. 

I have no friends, im estranged from my family but I live with my father (I care about him but I can't take the verbal and mental abuse). I'm in college for business degree but I've practically been on my own, living off my college refund for food and necessities as my dad refuses to even buy me groceries, I lived off canned food for a good couple months, and no one is hiring in my area. With inflation, its really hard. I also don't have a car or license to get to any nearby cities to try work there.
I dont know how to find entry level remote work so it's hard too.
He says I should be greatful im living rent free in a house but how can I be greatful if im starving myself, hating myself, alone. 

I dont want to spend my next few years getting drunk or high playing video games every night or watching YouTube while I work for my degree.
Just, life is shit and will probably continue to be shit. 

I've been recently considering the military and done really well on my tests and the idea to change my name just popped in my head. 

This will be my new start.

I want to start anew.

No more abuse, family toxicity, the name they hate so much would be dead to me. 

It has no value to me anymore, it's not who I am. I've accomplished nothing, im basically a blank sheet of paper.

I want to give myself value again that has been stripped from me for so long. I want to be proud of myself and my name, not who's attached to it.

"I (21F) am in my third year of nursing. I lost my older brother (23M) last month and it has been very difficult for me to process. I lost my father about three years ago and I still haven't processed my emotions healthily. Just suppressed them deep down. My mother is pretty emotional, and ever since my dad's death, I have done my best to keep strong for her sake. Doing almost everything, from housework to being her shoulder to cry on. I did the same when my brother died. But it has been so heavy on me. My brother and I had some unfinished and unresolved quarrels. We didn't speak to each other for almost three years despite living in the same house. He was emotionally immature. He had a gambling problem and pretty much only stayed at home to sleep and eat. He wasn't a model child, but beneath all that stupid stuff he did, he was a good person. I just wanted and waited for him to grow out of his childish ways so we could start to repair our relationship. He recently graduated and he wanted both my mom and I to attend the inside ceremony. We were slowly talking to each other again. But then he died in an MVA so suddenly, and it is so unfair. It still doesn't register in my brain. I even deactivated most of my social media accounts because I don't get how the world continues to move. I can't deal with seeing other people so happy. I can't bring myself to be happy. I'm letting this off my chest because no one in my life can possibly understand how I feel. My mom could, but it will just remind her of the pain even more. It's not fair how everyone else's life continues even after my brother's tragedy. I'd see his friends drinking and going out, his ex-gf posting thirst traps, and it hurts how it feels like the world has forgotten already. 

My classes start next week. I didn't bother to find a place to stay, my younger brother has a dorm an hour away and he won't be staying there so I'm just going to take his place. Nursing is very trying, too, and I don't know how I'm going to continue my studies. I have no energy left to give to my education. Most days, I just want to stay at home and be there for my mom. I've even considered transferring schools so I can come home and live with mom permanently. Even if it compromises my education. I just don't think I can face reality."

"I’m so sorry for your loss. This must be very difficult and I cannot imagine what you’re going through.

Most universities and colleges have more options than you’d think for taking time off. Call or meet with the registrar’s office (or your college’s equivalent). They may let you take a semester off or maybe a year, depending on your program. If your circumstances aren’t enough to grant you time off, you can also try to get a mental health leave (will need a doctor’s note).

I consider myself a good employee.  I don’t take lunch everyday because we have ridiculous, nonstop deadlines and requests all day long.  I have noticed that when I leave for lunch (which is maybe once a week), my boss will send a message in Messenger asking a non urgent question.  Basically a question where they can find the answer themselves.  It feels like I’m being watched and monitored.  Then when I return from lunch, as soon as I’m green, my boss will bombard me with messages asking if I finished my tasks and if this and that was saved.  Give me a break!!! I’m a fast worker, I complete all my work and I just need a long lunch occasionally.  I have been asked to let them  know when I go to lunch just in case management need something from our team.   But they all seem to ask my boss for answers at lunch.  It’s ridiculous.  I’m a salaried employee, I’m always at work on time, rarely leave my desk and mostly eat at my desk until it’s time to go.  Needless to say, today Ive had enough and left 10 mins early.  Lunch was so fun today.  I went with a group of coworkers from another team nd just enjoyed ourselves but not without feeling guilty for taking 30 mins extra.	food4kicks	post	35.48978544777685	male	White	0.9984657764434814	na	na	na	1	offmychest	no prediction.

"To give some background, this guy has been my friend since high school. I considered him a brother. Him and his ex of 5-6 years broke up last summer, he told her mentally he wasn’t in the right headspace to be in a relationship. He’s living out of state now and his ex lives here in my hometown, I consider her a friend as well and we go to the same parties often. She’s a sweet girl and from what she told me, he hurt her really bad throughout the relationship, from cheating to gaslighting etc. But that’s not my business and I never even confronted him about it or got involved.

After they broke up though, he just seemed to disappear. Even when I contacted him a few times for his birthday or just to check up on him there was no reply. Come to find out from another friend of ours (before he also got blocked) he just got married to some girl that seemed to be visiting from another country. His wife popped up on his feed and shared a picture of there wedding day. He didn’t post anything though. His family either. But he still went ahead and blocked me and most our friends. Especially those that know his ex. I texted him, he replied with a “what’s up?” And when I asked why he blocked me he simply silenced my texts. Never heard from him again.

I’m pissed and hurt. This was one of my closest friends of over a decades and for him to just cut me off like that makes me feel this dude was never a true friend. I never even got involved in his business or anything. It also sucks seeing how hurt his ex is over the matter, she claims not because she loves him but his actions of acting like she or any of us didn’t exist, which I know is rough.

(Update: he said he was out of service being at low service areas. Still blocked and I know he’s lying. Haven’t brought up the marriage.)"	Pretend-Tune-637	post	35.57404435901401	male	White	0.9993584752082825	na	na	na	34	offmychest	no prediction.
From what you describe I don't see why you would want to continue being friends with him. He cheated on and emotionally abused his ex (who you said is a nice girl), he didn't include anyone even his family it sounds like in his wedding. He also has been ignoring and blocking everyone.

"I’m going to tell you something that rarely comes out in situations like this, mind you, this may not fit your situation, but this is actually a much more common occurrence when people move away from places that they have a lot of memories, a lot of friends, and a lot of mistakes within those friendships.

He’s leaving it all behind not because those things weren’t valued for him, it’s because every mistake he made is known between everyone from his hometown, his hometown knows him at his worst, they know all his flaws.

He might see moving to another place and dating someone completely unrelated to his hometown as a way to reinvent himself.

Not saying that this is the case, but from my experience, I’ve known  a lot of people to move away and cut contact with most of their previous social circle because it could potentially cause problems down the road.

It sucks that you’re a casualty of this, but from what you wrote .. he doesn’t sound like someone worth keeping around, in fact, it sounds more like a liability.

He’s not someone I would want around my wife, that’s for sure.

But I myself have moved away from my hometown to join the military. A long time ago, I cut off the vast majority of people there.. but my closest friends, I’ve always left the door open, only because I trust them enough to not share some of my mistakes.. but there are a lot of acquaintances that I cut off completely, because they are bad influences and in my new life I wasn’t about that anymore."

All that proves is that he has no loyalty. Hopefully his wife doesn't end up on the wrong end of that peccadillo. He's trying to start over and separate from his previous life. Whether the reason is he doesn't want the wife to find out about who he used to be, he lied to her and doesn't want her to find out the truth, maybe she's really controlling and doesn't want him to connect so that she can isolate him for herself.

"I knew I couldn’t admit it, but I finally realize I’m done. 

My best friend has been so for a long time. Almost 5 years. We hangout almost every day, we’re more like sisters than friends. 

I took her on a trip. Just her and I. To a small lake town for fun. We’re young, so we go to drink at the beach at night. 

At the beach, these boys came up for us. Asked for my number, and said some pickup lines. it was nice and I found it funny, but I didn’t give my number because they were 17, and I’m 21. 

This girl loses it, the moment they leave. Full on “I wanna go, that just ruined my night.” I know it’s hard when they ask for someone’s number and not the other, but oh my god. Some actual kids asking for my number is so upsetting you have to demand we both go????? Like she fully packs up and heads to my car. I tell her that’s a stupid reason to leave, to just relax and enjoy the beach. She then grabs the tequila bottle, and starts chugging. Like, chugging. I try to grab it from her, she doesn’t budge, and I just watch as she drenched down half of it. 

Now I’m mad. She’s done this before, too many times. I’ve cleaned up this girls vomit countless times. And on top of it, she’s a sad drunk. It’s so annoying. Every time we go out and she drinks, the night ends with me having to counsel her. It was fine at first, I’m here for my friend, but when it’s every. Single. Time…. I’m done. She’s told me this, jokingly. Like “I’m such a sad drunk! It’s so bad!”. She KNOWS she is. Yet still she chooses to drink, knowing every time it’s going to ruin my night??

I just walk away for a bit with the alcohol. I’m not dealing with this. I keep her in my eyesight just to be careful, but I’m not dealing with this. 

When I come back… oh my god. She starts complaining about me, to me. She’s telling me she feels like I never really get it when she tells me her insecurities. I obviously do, but when you tell me every single day, I just start ignoring it. She says I don’t really listen to her. Then she keeps saying we need to go. She wants to go. I’m done, I just take her home, and leave her in bed, even though she was crying the whole way home. For once, I’m not here to council you. 

I just don’t get it. Am I not on vacation too????? Like does she not understand that? She drank that much, knowing this was going to happen, perfectly okay with it????

More rant. 

She has chronic anxiety. And like, it’s fine, whatever. But I know her triggers. So anytime I’m going with a group of friends, and invite her somewhere that may be triggering, I warn her in advance, and tell her that if she thinks her anxiety is gonna be bad, not to come. But she always says it’s going to be fine, despite KNOWING her own triggers, and comes, and the night ends with me taking care of her.

"I dated someone for 10 years. It wasn't a great relationship in a lot of ways and I've come to realize that it was abusive. We split amicably a couple of years ago and stuck about $3000 from the sale of our house into savings in our joint account. After we split, we squared up all debts and what not and then I opened a new acct with the intent that the joint acct would be closed now that all was resolved with that acct. I was not the primary on that acct so I was not able to do it myself. 

Two years later my ex messaged me asking for almost $500 for a bill of mine they just noticed was still coming out of the joint acct. I realized at that point they had been using that acct for the last two years as their own acct and had locked me out of it. The plan after everything was resolved was that it was supposed to be closed. I stupidly paid the money. 

I'm angry that something with my name on it is still being used without my knowledge or permission. It got me thinking about our relationship and how shitty it was, how this kind of stuff was normal. I got pretty angry about it. I even house sat for them in another state about a year after we split and watched my former cat. For free. They promised they would watch their former dogs for me in return but when I offered to bring the dogs to their house 174 miles away they made up excuses as to why they couldn't.

Now I'm angry. If they had closed the acct like they were supposed to I wouldn't owe them $500. I paid it. But the more I think about it, the more I want compensation. For gas, wear and tear on my vehicle and my time to drive to them to watch the cat-- $75/ day housesitting fees. Oh, and that $3,000+ that was left in the joint acct they claim they don't know what happened to? I want half. Thats not even the minimum, not even close, to compensate what I lost in that relationship. 

I want to write a check to myself and withdraw that money. Its still in my name, and I'm not taking anything that they don't owe me. I've never done anything like that in my life and I probably won't. But the thrill of giving my ledger sheet for what I took then telling them to f right off would feel so. effin. good. after everything I went through with them."	birdieponderinglife	post	37.36901909678869	female	White	0.9983413219451904	na	na	na	0	offmychest	failed
"Work trips were actually with her as she was dumb enough to check-in to locations on social media. She was also dumb enough to show pictures of ""her love"" on social media including them at her sisters wedding last year. 

I found out because my 4 year old mentioned her, the ""just a friend"". There was a sleepover while I was away. 

4 year old later blurted out she was told to keep things secret. 

He denies anything but a friendship and that neither of them would ever tell her such a thing. I reached out to her to let her know we've never been ""separated"". She seems to not care. 

Collateral damage is my 2 kids. I've given up on my own happiness and dreams of him and us being a happy family here in our home. But the pain I feel for my kids is ripping apart my insides. How do I tell a newly minted teenager their dad has used us this way? How do I not break them? And my poor sweet little one. She felt something off and let me know. I can't stop crying for them. He thinks this won't affect him. He is delusional.

Now I know I wasn't delusional as little things would pop into her life and as they added up he would call me names and call me ungrateful. He is currently calling me hysterical and crazy. 

How in the fuck can people be this shitty and not recognize their behavior. His family didn't know. Hers probably doesn't even know about me. I want to go scorched earth and tell them who she is and who she is with. But don't want to jeopardize my character when it comes to the battle of custody and support. 

How do I do good my babies? I'm so lost and so hurt. I can't stop crying."	No-Fig-1090	post	24.596065122182814	female	White	0.9988119602203369	na	na	na	1	offmychest	failed
Give your children a child-friendly rundown of what happened. Let everyone else know the adult version. Also, get your kiddos therapy because they will need it. Make sure to reenforce that this isn't their fault, especially to your youngest, and that the reason you are divorcing is because of their dad, not them. You and your children deserve better. Your soon-to-be ex and his side piece are disgusting pond scum that deserve every bit of the karmic justice coming at them like a bullet train. Hope they get bulldozed by it. Just remember you are dignity and class, strength and courage, and a force to be reckoned with. Make them cower under your might and fade away from your radiance.

"It’s a very long story, but I appreciate those that stick around to read it. I have no one to talk to about this and I need to get it off my chest. So those that stay, thank you.

I met this girl online during the pandemic through mutual friends. She lives in another country, although I tend to visit the country very frequently because that’s where my family lives and she’s in fact one of their neighbors. She and I would always play with her group of friends video games online eventually they stop playing and they were just always be her and I. We got each other’s numbers and we begin talking on a daily basis. Later my friend told me that she liked me however one I did not know her in person and two I was still getting over a recent break up so I wasn’t ready to date yet, it wasn’t the right time. So I would just treat her as a friend during that time. Eventually once the pandemic died down, I traveled to my families and we met up and hung out although it was a bit strange, but probably because it was a first time meeting each other. During that period I developed feelings for her, we would keep in contact and hangout some more. After I came back from my trip, we stopped talking, no explanation, things just got kind of cold and then eventually she deleted her social medias and we lost contact. After that happened I really began to miss her, and what we used to have and the times we shared online together even in person, and it pained me that I wasn’t able to tell her how I felt about her.  Eventually time went on I went on with my life and I moved on… or so I thought.

A few months ago, out of the blue, I received a text from her. We began talking again and catching up. The following months It was just talking every day nonstop from morning to night, every morning I would receive a good morning text from her. She would always ask me if I had eaten already and what I’m doing and it was nice to have her back again and have someone to talk to. Eventually the old feelings I had for her started to come back however however, her treatment to me was more friendly than romantic. Sometimes she would seem uninterested in talking to me, and sometimes she would go days without replying to me when she would reply she would usually say something short and dry. It just wasn’t the same as it used to be. Eventually I worked up the courage to tell her how I feel. I told her that I liked her and I know we live far apart, but I was willing to travel for her just to see her.(either ways I visit often and she lives close to my family) but she tells me that she likes someone else. That honestly broke me and it felt like a knife to the heart. I felt like I have missed my chance back when I had it and now and now that I finally spoke up, it was too late. However, I told her I understood and that I hope everything works out well between her and whoever she liked or had. It was weird because she would keep texting me the following days as if nothing happened. And I honestly wanted my space so I will reply short dry texts and she got the message and stopped replying one day. I wasn’t mad I was just hurt  and wanted Time to heal. 

For a month we didn’t talk. Eventually she requested me on Instagram. I thought she wanted to talk things out but also I thought to myself maybe she just misses me talking to her and just wants my attention. I then made the mistake of accepting her request and then she began to reply to anything I posted as if trying to initiate a conversation. we eventually started talking, but we never brought up what happened. I thought maybe I could move past my feelings and talk to her only as a friend but eventually, my feelings came back. At this point this felt like an endless cycle, I kept falling for her, but I knew that she did not feel the same for me, and it was torture for me. I was constantly checking my phone to see if she sent me any messages, if she posted something or viewed my stories and that’s not healthy.At that point I knew I had to let her go for good for my own health. Last week I visited my families again and her and I met up twice to hang out. However, it wasn’t like the previous times we hung out. It was kind of awkward. When it was time for me to head back home I had asked her if it’s OK if I could stop by her house and say goodbye to her but she never replied and when she did it was very late at night so I tried to call her at least, but she ignored my call and said that she never heard my call, even though she replied a second later. so I ended up just sending her a text, explaining how I felt. I told her I tried to see her and talk to her as a friend, but I couldn’t, because I still had feelings for her, and I still wanted to be something more than friends. I told her I was confused as to why she still wanted to keep talking to me and hanging out with me if she had interest in someone else and she only saw me as a friend and she knew that I wanted to be more than that. I told her that I loved her and care for her, but I also care about myself and my well-being, and keeping in contact with her has not helped me move on. I thanked her for the fun times we shared, I wished her well in her life and goals, and that I hope whoever she ends up with treats her with lots of love and care. But from now on, it’s best if I keep my distance from her. Her response shocked me, although she seemed very upset of everything I told her she said she completely understood, and that I would always find a friend in her. We said goodbye to each other, and then I proceeded to delete her number, and then unfollow her on all social medias I had her on. And thats that.

These past few days I wonder if I made the right choice because now I lost the pretty much only person that talked to me. I no longer wake up to her texts like I used to. Every time I check my phone I wish to see a message from her. I miss her a lot and I keep thinking if maybe I could’ve handled things differently. Yet, I wonder maybe she only used me for the attention, and I’m the idiot that gave it to her and it was the right move to let her go. I don’t know what to feel. This sucks."

"In 2020, my partner at the time had an affair. The relationship was only for a couple of years when the affair started, after 6 months of the affair I found out the truth. 

It wasn’t so much the affair that had an affect on me, it was the lying, the gaslighting, manipulation, projection and overall emotional abuse that he used to hide the affair. 
He went from being an incredible partner to someone I didn’t recognise, he blamed it on depression, so I supported him, thinking he needed help, that’s the kind of support I would want to receive from a partner.

After I found out about the affair and the duration, everything fell into place. I could connect the dots which in hindsight were obvious. 
The level of betrayal I felt was a feeling I didn’t imagine would be possible. 
I was a mess. I doubt I’ve ever reached that level of low, I was already a mess because of the emotional turmoil he had put me through because of ‘depression’ but this was something else. I was diagnosed with PTSD, heavily medicated and was extremely unwell. 

Following our breakup, he tried to rekindle things more than once, presents would turn up at my house, at my workplace, he would turn up at my house full of apologies. This set my healing back enormously. This went on for a year. 

Now time has passed I felt healed. 

He called me last week, coincidentally I had just broke up with my recent partner, who I love. he said he can speak from experience that losing me might my recent partners biggest regret in life. He told me all the things about me he admired and how I helped him become the person he was today. I didn’t ask much about his life. He did tell me that he was updating my emergency contact details in his will because that’s the least he could do. 

I never thought more of it until today. I was told he had a baby with the girl he had an affair with in April. They’re happily living together and have been since him and I separated. All the presents, turning up at my house and keeping me from moving on… he was with her and still is. I was a casualty in his quest to happiness and I felt angry. 

I felt like I was hit by a truck. I felt every bit of pain go through me again. The panic attacks, the tears, the meltdown and I don’t understand why I still feel that way or why it affected me so much and I feel awful that I let it do that to me. I blocked him entirely from every platform, once again. 

Anyway I needed to get this out."	Individual_You_7431	post	26.068710495341744	female	White	0.9971621632575989	na	na	na	27	offmychest	failed

You might want to consider a bit of payback.

I (F) just broke up with my ex boyfriend of a little over 2 years. I have strong resentment towards him because of how he has talked to me and unfortunately that’s what ended things for me mentally and physically. I can’t think straight when he is around. I am disgusted and angry when he touches me or says something sexual to me. I feel this way because he has called me a bad mom, he assumes things about me my friends and family because of our race, I have never cheated on him and he constantly implies I’m doing things. He also blames his childhood on a lot of things like his abusive dad and being poor. When I met him he had no car no license and he moved into my house and then drive my car. Til this day he still has no license or car and continues to try to attack my character and parenting. I have been nothing but good to him and accepted all his trauma and him apologizing for how he talks to me. Some people say well he didn’t cheat or put his hands on you but I feel like him verbally trying to hurt me and say bad things and just apologizing is not ok. I have already lost attraction and respect. I refuse to fix something i didn’t break.

"idrk y im doing this but its jus something thats been bothering me more recently. to clarify im a boy, 17 n goin thru hellshit rn mentally so this shit might jus be some cope but idk.

as a kid i been victim to sexual abuse in multiple instances by multiple ppl thru out my life. these occurances happened in the age range 7-10 i think. first by a female middle schooler (i think she was, also it was brief ig), then by her 16-17 yr old brother (tried to make me oral, did it to me), then a couple handful times by an older female cousin on my stepdad side (naked grinding since i was too young to get erect). The last part is what affects me most

I use to tell myself this shit was never trauma but i learned how it can translate to kinks. ie i dont like anything abt a man im straight, but seeing pics of genitals sometimes cause a lil arousal cuz that one instance mentioned earlier. Sometimes i look back n wish i jus did it or would happen again. It makes me very uncomfortable.

it gets so much fucking worse when thinking abt being taken advantage of.  i imagine myself as a young naive kid or teen or even myself now and having an older person (mostly woman) want me so much that they jus take me against my will and use me even if illegal. ig the idea is they love/want me so much they would go so far??? ik that sounds fcked up but i been relentlessly struggling w lonliness, emptiness, anxiety, depression, etc so maybe thas y. i even find myself getting aroused when hearing of cases involving adults/minors, teachers/students, etc. i try so hard to distract my thoughts and feel disgusted but deep down ik how it makes me feel. its so disgusting and gross to think like that even if im tryna mask it i feel so guilty for it. i want it to stop.

cuz of this shit too im attracted to girls who are a year or two older than me or even mature women (i avoid younger than me no matter the difference) but idk how real this is maybe im jus fetishsizing cuz i can fantasize abt even ppl i dont necessarily find attractive doing it to me. i think its the act and idea of being r\*ped/molested. its so fucking wrong

also i cant look at that cousin the same ever. all i see is what she did to me. it dont make me feel resent or nothing, i literally feel lust. i literally want it to happen all over again. i hate these feelings they make me feel like a freak"	occasionaluseonly	post	23.527385695012676	female	White	0.025658687576651573	na	na	na	2	offmychest	failed
". Whoa there is so much to unpack here but I have like 20 minutes before I need to hit the road for an hour. Look you are not alone. And you are NOT a weirdo or a freak. You were abused. Chronically abused while growing up. One instance can destroy your inner psyche. More than two? Yikes.  Your abused led to what is called hyper sexualization. You were introduced to levels of sex far more impact full than your traditional mommy and daddy or playing house/doctor play at those levels normally would. People used you in sexual acts far more shocking than normal teens and kids. This is strictly not your fault. 


First thing first any fantasy you have don't use illegal materials to satisfy them and don't put yourself at risk for this, also if you are aroused by dicks somewhat then let yourself be aroused. You could be straight leaning bi and not realize it. I don't suscribe to the notion abuse makes one gay. I feel a child that gets targeted may have been targeted because they are expressing their life in a way a groomer identify as gay/bi and so they move on that victim. 


But basically explore it even if freaks you out cuz blocking things becomes unhealthy and obsession in the mind..

with the genital thing i dont think its so much the image of it, but more the associated trauma w it. cuz i genuinely do not like men, its like the being used part. but i have seen things like dicks on girls on the internet (albiet, unconsentually lol) and i do avoid that cuz it does do something. im still young and exploring tho and dont know myself too well.

I realised college really isn’t for me but I don’t know what to do. I genuinely don’t see myself getting a 9-5 job, I work part time and I couldn’t do it full time, I would lose my mind in a week. 

I’m so mentally ill and probably have a lot of undiagnosed stuff but I can’t even get myself to go to a doctor so they could help me. I went once and I got referred to a psychiatrist but my countries healthcare system is falling apart and there was an error and I never got my appointment and then I stopped trying. Did nothing to fix it because on a deep level I don’t want to admit to myself that I’m that fucked up in the head and I can’t even talk about my feelings. I want to fix all of my issues myself but after trying for 10 years it really isn’t getting anywhere. 

I can’t even talk to my friends about my issues because I’m so ashamed and they are all probably thinking I’m just a huge failure. They are all getting bachelors degrees meanwhile I’m still in freaking first year. I used to be so smart, used to do so well in school but then in senior year of high school I just stopped trying. I was getting so tired and it just wasn’t worth it anymore. It’s also when covid started and I got super bad post covid symptoms and I genuinely think my brain got fried by it. My memory is so bad, like I’m so forgetful all of the sudden and I just can’t remember the material for the exams. But also I know I’m not even trying that hard, this year I think I went to class twice and I just can’t get myself to go more and to study. Like there is something in my brain that stopping me and I just can’t get past it. 

The degree I’m trying to get is something I’m kind of passionate about but I can never see myself doing it as my job so I don’t think that helps at all. I just want to skip this part of my life and just get to when I have a family or just disappear. All I want to do is travel with my dog who is as messed up in the head as me. But I don’t have money for that and if I don’t do something seriously about my education so I can get a well paying job I will never even get to that point of my life. 

I’m just so freaking tired and I just want to give up. I’m so lost at what to do and I genuinely don’t see my life leading into anything great. I barely even have any friends because I isolate myself so much, always too damn tired to go anywhere and I’m so socially awkward, I haven’t made one single friend while at university."	cernezelana	post	21.286688760893217	male	White	0.9991658926010132	na	na	na	1	offmychest	no prediction.
"I (25f) recently took in my grandfather due to some unfortunate circumstances involving financial abuse/isolation from the rest of our family. I haven’t really been in contract with him since Covid but he moved in with us (bf and I) at the end of June. Now, I find myself getting frustrated and I’m not sure why. My grandfather isn’t a complicated person -he is deaf and blind and a diabetic which sounds worse than it is. He’s still pretty independent but needs meals to be cooked for him and his medication needs to be dispensed by me (I have a dog that will surely eat anything that hits the floor, and I don’t trust my grandpa with taking his own meds as he has dropped things before). 

I just want to make it clear that I do love my grandfather and I’m happy he’s living with me because I know it’s the best place for him as it’s safe and he can access everything very easily. However, we don’t really get respite and when we do, I just end up feeling guilty. Right now, I have a terrible cough and worried about getting him sick so I asked my mom if she could take him for a few days just to be safe. The issue with that is my mother is very much a collector of things and her house probably isn’t the easiest for him to navigate. 

I don’t like sending him off to different places (sometimes he goes over to my brothers place which is better than my moms place) because I think stability is really important….but I feel like I’m doing everything wrong and feel selfish when I feel like I need some respite. My grandfathers been through a lot in the span of 7months so I try really hard to be helpful and get him into different things. I currently have him on waiting lists for housing and I’m trying to get him in daily activities so he can socialize as I know this is important to him. 

This is the first time I’ve ever had to take care of someone else before and I just feel stuck and I feel like this makes me a bad person. I don’t know if this is the beginning of burn out or I’m just being over dramatic!?"	LifeAsLiz20	post	18.080923704037033	female	White	0.9959529638290405	na	na	na	4	offmychest	no prediction.

"I’m sorry for the long post. I just have never really talked about this in length, and I really need to vent because I can’t stop crying. 

To start, when my mother found out she was pregnant, my bio father didn’t care and left the same night. She carried me while also raising my two older sisters, who she’d had with who I call my real Dad. 

When I was born, he called and showed up for me to be there for my mom and I, because he knew that my biological father wouldn’t be around. I don’t know the ins and out of my mom’s relationship with him, but they essentially got back together sometime after I was born. 

My childhood was never perfect. But it was to me. I didn’t know at first that he wasn’t my Dad, that my sisters were only half. I was just a happy kid that grew up in a family and I loved them all, even when I said I didn’t in my petulant moments. 

Christmases were sacred. Birthdays were sacred. New Years were celebrated. Thanksgivings meant something. I remember so many of the happy memories, and in hindsight, very little of the bad ones. I think it’s why I became such a traditionalist as far as holidays and celebrations go. And I love that part of me, it reminds me of how special it felt as a kid. 

Around the time I was 7, my parents split up, and my Mom spilled the beans to me that he wasn’t my real Dad. I remember the moment, but not how I felt or really what I was thinking. But in my eyes, he was still my Dad. He was still the man who could hold me in one arm curled up to his chest while he sang me to sleep. I still hear the song he made for me, that he took from a kid’s show and remade with my name. I still remember the nights half asleep in his arms, and how it sounded hearing his voice in my ear against his chest, all hollow and booming sounding. 

There was a slight falling out when I was in high school because of how he treated one of my sisters, the one I was close to. I chose her side because I felt it was right. But he still was considered my Dad. We didn’t keep in touch as much when I was older, partly because he remarried, partly because I wasn’t sure I was welcome. At this point I could recognize he meant more to me because of the childhood he gave me, even if he wasn’t as active of a participant in my older life. But it still meant something. 

6 years ago, he passed from cancer. It was a long and arduous ordeal, and it broke my heart because I wanted to be there for him and he told me not to be. To this day, I don’t know if it’s because he really didn’t want me there or he didn’t want me to see him like that. If maybe he was holding on to the childhood like I was, and felt like he didn’t want his littlest daughter to see what was happening. 

I showed up to the hospital the day before he died. Without me saying a word, the first thing he said was “I’m sorry I can’t be here longer for you” and part of me wondered if he somehow knew or had a sense how much that specifically would mean to me. I was young, I was just finally living on my own, and I was really struggling with the fact that so many traditions that my sisters got, I wouldn’t get. 

He’d never give blessings to whoever I married. He wouldn’t walk me down the aisle. He’d never meet his grandchildren. My kids insofar only have one grandparent, my mother, if she’s still there if/when I have them as she has her own health issues. Time was really the only thing he could apologize for, and how he couldn’t give me more, even though it wasn’t his fault. It broke me. 

After he passed, I learned that his wife had decided I wasn’t his child and I was cut from the obituary. I only got along with one of my sisters, and she was the only one who went to bat for me on it since they were the only ones there. 

I wasn’t officially invited to the funeral, but I still went with my mother, and we were essentially chased off the premises. No one except my mom’s side of the family really cared that I wasn’t included. They knew I was his daughter too and were sad and outraged for me that I was getting treated this way, when I was the daughter he went out of his way to choose. 

His wife grew up spoiled and entitled and selfish. I’m not sure what he saw in her. She’s kept his ashes from all of us for the past 6 years before now, and she’s now finally deciding to apologize for that selfishness and ask if his daughters would like to be there when she lays him to rest. 

His daughters, except for me. Again. 

My heart feels like it’s breaking all over again like it did when he passed. I miss him. I miss him so much it aches in my bones. I miss hearing his voice, I miss being small and in his arms. I miss feeling wanted in his life. I miss how much of my life he hasn’t been and won’t be able to be there for. I know life isn’t fair, I know some people have it worse than me. But it hurts so much and I think it’s hurt this whole time and I’ve just avoided it. I don’t know how to get through it. 

TLDR; biofather abandoned me at conception, older sisters’s Dad took me in as his own and gave me the childhood I needed, Dad broke up with Mom and remarried, new wife decides I’m not his daughter in any capacity after he passed from cancer"	ExaminationNo6502	post	32.199760888287805	male	White	0.003299861680716276	na	na	na	2	offmychest	no prediction.

"Hello!
Today my kitty went in for a CT scan since he has been sick for a few months. I've sent him to countless vets and everyone took my money and didnt find a solution. After 7 months I got the results today. Cancer, all over his body.

This morning I was getting ready for work. Gave him a few pats and put him in his kettle. That was the last time I ever saw him...

He was sedated for the CT scan and I got a call at 4pm stating he was sick and wouldnt ever make a recovery. In a second sentence I was asked if I would want to euthanize him. My vet is over an hour away from my job and they said they wouldnt be able to keep him down for that long so my decision was; euthanize him while he was still under sedation - or wake him up, take him home and euthanize him another day. I thought I was making the right decision in letting them euthanize him right then, but retrospectively i regret not picking him up. His last hours were spent scared alone at a vets office and his mommy wasnt even there to see him off. I didnt give him a proper goodbye and I wish I couldve hugged him. I also wouldve loved to get his paw print but I didnt get any of that. 

When he left this morning the fact that he wouldnt come home never even crossed my mind.

I am beyond devestated and regret letting him go like this. He was my best friend and I feel like I let him down."	ultrasubism	post	25.573374688826057	female	White	0.9976857900619507	na	na	na	7	offmychest	no prediction.

"I’ve been raped, assaulted, and brutalized by numerous men throughout my life. My ex from high school, a few other guys in high school, and most recently my coworker from a few years ago.
I’ve also been sexually harassed, had unsolicited disgusting comments and advances made towards me by men multiple times.

I have tried so hard to heal, to move past these experiences, and to forgive men. I just can’t seem to reconcile it anymore. Every day I see examples of men showing disgusting depraved behavior towards women, being violent and degrading. They assault us, then say we deserve it because we dressed a certain way or asked for it, or teased them. 

I just cannot see myself ever trusting another man again. I truly don’t believe men can care about women. I don’t believe they can really love women. I believe it’s in their nature to harm, degrade, and violate women. I know these beliefs are wrong and these traits don’t apply to all men, but the more I am hurt by them I can’t help but think it. 

I can’t even trust men in my daily life anymore; on the street, in my classes, at the store. I feel so unsafe. I can’t sleep at night because I have nightmares about my rapists getting into my house and hurting me again. I can’t speak to men anymore without thinking they are going to snap and rape or beat me. 

I can’t stand to think of a man touching me or getting aroused by me. I can’t stand the fact that men see me in a sexual way. I can’t stand them looking at me. I am disgusted by men’s sexuality. I think if a man made sexual comments at me now, I would want to rip my intestines out and bleed to death on the ground."

In fact, sometimes the fact that there are other women in the world for me to have friendships and companionships with is one thing that helps me to feel not so alone. I feel like i have a support system with other women.

I'm not entirely sure about my sexuality, to be honest. I'm pretty averse to/repulsed by sex in general, so I may be ace.

It's been a year. I know you've been hurt on my account too many times, but you really broke my heart. I don't know the last time I cried like that.

I've found the woman of my dreams. Miss perfect. She's gorgeous and sweet and smart and funny. Hell, she's prettier, kinder, smarter, and more put together than you.

So why the fuck won't you leave my mind? Why can't I forget? Sure, the sex isn't quite as good, but she and I have years to perfect that. That isn't it. You also aren't the first to steal a piece of me that you can't give back. Why are you the only one I can't forget?

I feel like a piece of shit when I have her in my arms and you pop into my mind out of nowhere. I don't want you. I want her.

But part of me still wants you.

I wish we never had closure. I wish we didn't have that hours long conversation after the month that you ghosted me.

I wish you left me feeling like an option. Maybe I wouldn't be thinking of you still.

I'm desperately in love with this girl, but she doesnt feel like my best friend like you did. Maybe that just comes in time. We did have 3 years together, and I've only known this girl half a year if that.

I thought a year without seeing you would be enough. Maybe I just need to wait longer. Maybe I just need time for what I have now to blossom into more than what I had with you.

"I (19M) got calls from someone a few days ago but I didn’t answer them because I was busy talking and having supper with my mom’s boyfriend’s parents. After everyone said their goodbyes, I go back downstairs and I see multiple messages from my friend that there was a girl that contacted both of us for a threesome. Now I was sure my friend was bullshitting me and trying to get a laugh out of me or something until I go to my voicemail. I was in utter disbelief at what I heard from my voicemail that this girl who had the same name to another girl I like, told me she had a crush on me, so I thought it was her because I knew only two girls at the time with that same name and I was very interested in one of them. I wanted to call her back but the problem was she didn’t leave a phone number and only left an unknown caller ID. But then I was being a bit skeptical: She said she got my phone number from my friend but he can’t remember a phone number to save his life. A last name was never mentioned and she said she had a crush but wanted a threesome with my friend, so that gave me more reasons to be suspicious. I then thought both me and my friend got pranked and that would’ve been the end of it but I went to see how many times she called and it was 3 times and when I went back to the voicemail she sounded very nervous when saying her confession to me. I decided I was gonna go full detective and try to find out who this mystery girl was.

I tried talking to the other girls with the same name (since only two girls in my high school graduated with these names) and the first one never got back to me but the second one confirmed with me that it wasn’t her after, asking if she remembered sending anything like this to me and she said no. So I thought now that the first girl with the same name was playing a prank and didn’t want to answer back and just left it at that.

A couple of days later I went to my friends house to hangout and meet up with a friend we hadn’t spoke to in 3 years when all of a sudden she calls my friend. He tried getting a phone number from her and asked what we thought about her proposal. We were both interested and then she said something I didn’t even consider. This was a guy who had taken HRT in order to transition into a girl. We both looked at each other in disbelief and we said we would call her back now that we got a phone number to call her back on. He hung up after they finished talking and we both looked at each with “what now?” Written on our faces. My friend said that he was calling off the threesome and if I wanted to have sex with her he wouldn’t object but here’s the problem: Just like my friend, I am straight. And I want to have kids of my own in the future, which unfortunately for her, men transitioning into women cannot get pregnant, no matter what some people may say.

So now I am stuck as I don’t know how to reject her without making her feel awful. Any advice is appreciated and I will update this story once I have found or someone finds a way I can tell her.

I just moved in the US to my parents when I was 19. I’m already 21 and I still have to ask my father to do whatever I want. I don’t have any freedom, like I can’t even take an uber or lyft without him getting mad at me. I just applied for a part time job while I still work full time, so 2 jobs and I don’t have any license yet because no one’s teaching me and I can’t afford the lessons. I did passed my knowledge test but I can’t go get my permit because no one can drive me to the dmv and I’m too scared to book an uber, yet they’re pressuring me to get a license. My father would always drive me to work, and to go home, I would ask my coworkers if they could drop me off but sometimes my father would drive me home. The thing is my father and I works in the same place so when he would drive me home, he’s clocked in or in the middle of working. He could get in big trouble for that so I would say I’m just gonna take an uber but then he’ll get mad at me and he even told me one time “can’t you wait!?” so I would wait for hours before I could go home. I just don’t want to bother him anymore and depend on him every single time. Right now we’re in the middle of not acknowledging each other’s presence but I would still have to ask him if he could drive me because if I didn’t I would get in trouble. He even called me arrogant and stubborn because I told him I’m just gonna take an uber and even explained to him why I would not ask him to drive me to my other work. I’m also scared when he’s driving because he would go over the speed limit and would not fully stop at the sign so that makes me paranoid and sometimes he would get a call asking where he is. I’m not even allow to explain or say what I wanted to because that’s disrespectful to him and I shouldn’t answer him. Now my step mom isn’t talking to me either or even acknowledging me so I would give her the same energy, they must have think that I’m being mean and rude to them when I’m just concern with my father, because what if he’s over-speeding a he hit a child? (There’s a school near us) and most of the times those children will not look at their surroundings. Am I wrong? Am I rude? I told this to my friend and she told me when I got here in the us I just lost my freedom.	Skta_Gntki	post	20.94931881490176	female	White	0.9993101358413696	na	na	na	6	offmychest	failed

"I f21 work at a retirement home cafe, its a small booth and its me and the boss who owns the place, he is almost around his 50 if that matters and have two kids (divorced). 
Now yesterday i was working alone at some point and i had a lot of people come in a wave and i got so stressed and started to cry and after a while the boss came when he saw it on cameras. After it calmed down he took me aside and hugged me and apologized he left me alone and he wont do that anymore and comforted me.
And he sometimes calls me sweety or just squeeze my shoulder. He is a nice person overall  BUT, since i dont have a dad idk if this behaviour is right between us, maybe he sees me as like a ""daughter"" or so..but i just dont know how to see this situation and if its normal, im not used to ""father"" figure..

I don’t think it is not having a Dad that is making you think this, to me, this is normal nice peoples behaviour (irrespective of male or female) but if there is something that is making you uncomfortable you need to make it known to the person ie: please don’t hug me or squeeze my shoulder - it makes me feel uncomfortable."	batata1001	reply	na	na	na	0.015061940997838974	weak	no	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.

From the title, I was expecting much worse! 😅 If you ever feel uncomfortable, please say something! Find someone, and speak up. In this case, it does sound like a fatherly figure. You may remind him of his kids, and that parental instinct kicks in a bit. I will say, pet names and touching is a slippery slope; if his intentions are more malicious, he could use those things against you. So I say again, if anything he says or does makes you feel uneasy, PLEASE find someone you can trust and tell them about it.

"Confession time: resisting temptation (Doctor editon)

Where to start. I have a crush, but it’s complicated and all types of wrong. And I will be the good person Jesus wants me to be and resist the temptation of the devil. 

But I must confess. Just simply because. 

My crush began around the second to last week or so of July. I am a medical assistant and he of course is …………. A DOCTOR! eeeeeep. I know. Never in a million years in your dreams. I KNOW. Anyways I have noticed a shift in his energy. He has texted me after hours about non work related things just joking around with me. That’s number 1. Number two I obsessively looked up body language cues and it may be bullshit IDK I’m going crazy. 
He leans in to talk to me, stands by me in little group circle talks, when he is talking to me or multiple people in a room his feet directly face me and he makes direct eye contact with me heavily. He does scan the room but then locks with me. There are moments when he drops something off for me to take care of as he’s walking away I smile at him and he smiles back. This happens allllllll day. I do not see him smiling at anyone else this way in the office. He is typically very angry looking walking down the hallway, but when he sees me he’s all smiles.  I have caught him looking at me during group circle talks. when others are talking..  he’s looking at me. IT is an effort trying to keep a conversation short with him because I love talking to him. He is a great listener. And it seems as though he doesn’t mind conversing with me, to me it seems he is smiling more and enjoys it! But you can call me delusional I need people to tell me because this is all types of wrong. Why you may ask? I have a boyfriend and HES MARRIED! no good. Very very very very very BAD!!!!!!! I need to shake this shit off but I feel so synced with him energy wise. And I have been deprived of this kind of connection. Google says to distract myself I’m going to really try.

"so about 4 months ago, my best friend/family friend passed away unexpectedly. it emotionally destroyed me, i went through breakdown after breakdown and it felt like the emotional pain would never end. eventually i was able it pull myself together, and i would say im pretty happy these days despite what happened.

i just wanna say im 19, i’ve never had something like this happen to me before this point, and im not really sure how to navigate grief, this is just me detailing my experiences because i’ve been thinking about it recently.

like i said, im handling it better these days, im not breaking down as often as i used to. but at least once a month since her passing, something triggers me and the pain hits me all over again like when i first got the news. it’s like a whole wave of grief and it’s awful, i’m unable to sleep for that night because of it. you’d think these triggers would so big and so relevant to her but no, it’s the dumbest shit that sends me down this spiral. last month, i thought i failed a uni exam of mine(i didn’t, i actually did pretty good) and that got me thinking about her. i felt like i was going to keep getting more depressed and that i can’t make a comeback academically, socially, mentally, etc because her death is just too much to bear. i was fine. the rest of that month was fine. but it felt like i was dying when i remembered everything again.

this month is even stupider. it was yesterday, and you wanna know what triggered it this time around? a video game. it was genshin impact. we used to play it together and talk about it alot before she passed. for those who don’t know, every year genshin comes out with a huge update that adds a lot of new things to the game, and these updates occur in versions 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, you get the idea. yesterday 4.0 came out and i was really excited for it, my day was totally normal. then i randomly realized that she will never get to see 4.0 like she did the past versions, she’ll never even see how the story ends. she’ll never get to play her favourite characters that she talked to me about so passionately. something about that upset me so bad that i cried until 3am morning, grieving like i did in april.

it’s hard to go through each month having this happen. does it ever get easier? i hope so, this fucking sucks."	themagicalpencilcase	post	10.643356244741652	female	White	0.9972183704376221	na	na	na	1	offmychest	no prediction.

"I’m(22f) and have been in one 8 month relationship that ended 3 years ago. That was my only real relationship. Since then I’ve been on probably 10 dates. I was in a situationship with a guy 2 years ago who treated me like trash and I finally ended it when I found out he had a girlfriend for the last 3 months of our situation. I can’t seem to find anyone right for me and it makes me feel like something is wrong with me. And being treated badly in the past makes me feel like there is something even more wrong with me.

I don’t mean to come off narcissistic, but I’m pretty and I know I am because everyone has told me that my entire life (friends, family, strangers, etc), so it makes me feel like something inside me is broken that makes people not like me. 

All of my best friends are in relationships and I am so happy for them. But it hurts to see everyone I know so happy with a partner. I hurt so bad inside not ever having things work out. I’ve been ghosted, been told I was led on for fun, used for sex, etc. 

I have so much love to give and I am such a romantic. I know I’m only 22, almost 23, but it still hurts. The only time I don’t feel this way is when I’m working or with friends. Any other time, I can’t help but feel so alone and depressed.

"I recently had to move in temporarily with my parents after selling my house and before moving into my new space

I have not had the easiest time with them growing up and they were the cause of a lot of my mental health issues so it’s not surprising that they are once again providing their thoughts and feelings about my body/weight/parenting etc

But in the past few days they have made several comments that I just can’t really get past anymore and I’m feeling like it’s time for me to cut contact as soon as I move out.

I know I have put on some weight as I lost my health insurance and haven’t been taking my thyroid medication( I have hypothyroidism) along with being the only one caring for my toddler twins, being incredibly stressed getting s divorce, working full time, dealing with a verbally shitty spouse, selling a house, packing up an entire house, dealing with a kid who has had to go to the ER twice for a serious condition, having a real lack of sleep, and being absolutely railroaded at every moment by my parents 

But the following things have really just put icing on the cake 

1. My mom bought donuts and my kids (they are 3) grabbed them from the counter and demolished them while I was working. My mom came down and said “you didn’t eat 5 donuts did you” and I was confused and said no I had one and she was like “well they are all gone…”. This may seem harmless but a few years ago I wanted to go to krispy kreme on a family road trip because I hadn’t been in over 5 years and my mom told me “you don’t need anymore sweets today”. I was 26 at the time and not asking her permission.

2. My dad decided to ask me if I have ever thought of having the same surgery my sister did to be healthier. She had a gastric bypass and my parents berated her. I told him we aren’t going to have this conversation and effectively shut it down but I’m still reeling from the feelings of having him say that to me. Especially as a  week or so ago I went off on him for being a bad dad and refusing to be supportive of me trying to chose better for myself and contributing to my crippling mental health and self esteem issues and he sat there and acted devastated but apparently not devastated enough to listen to half the things I said to him.  

3. My therapist let me know that in my parents and majority of my family I have a very poor support system and they have essentially broken me in many ways to the point that I have to seek validation in being hurt or angry or sad or frustrated in everyone to make sure I’m not being dramatic. 

Anyways I know I need to cut ties it will be a lot harder as I’m much closer to “home” now but I’m genuinely angry about it because all I really need and want is support as I’m incredibly overwhelmed and stressed out in life and no matter how hard I try I feel like they are right there with a snarky comment just waiting to hurl at me. They may think they are being “helpful” but they also never just ask what I need to be supported. And they are basically the reason I married my toxic and crappy ex and stayed with him for so long because atleast I wasn’t with them anymore. 

Idk I guess I’m looking for advice but moreso just needing to vent. I only have a few days before I’m not here anymore and I cannot wait."	ArtStraight7372	post	32.15212127793464	female	White	0.9992139339447021	na	na	na	5	offmychest	no prediction.

Your situation sounds extremely selfish though. They bought donuts and they're gone and asked if you ate them and you're offended? 

Your dad sounds worried about your health and willing to accept that your sister maybe made the right choice for her and is hoping it's the right one for you?

"It sounds to me like a situation where you’re on edge from the understandable stress of a divorce and caring for twins, etc. You’re also extremely sensitive to any little thing your parents say, likely because of the stress you’re under and because, like everyone, you have a lot of history with your parents and every little thing comes loaded with baggage, some of which is their fault, some of which may be yours.

I think being really aware of your sensitivity right now would be helpful and trying to pause before reacting. Easier said than done, of course. But though your parents may not be as supportive as they could be emotionally, they’re there for you in a very material way at a difficult time. (Giving you a place to live.) That’s meaningful. And that’s a very important kind of love. I don’t say that to dismiss everything you’re feeling, by any means, but as a reminder to keep with you in those moments you’re feeling hurt by something that they say. 

Only you can choose whether or not to maintain a close relationship with your parents but I’d recommend examining how much these comments are intending to hurt you and how much is just the stress of the time.

If he believes your relationship matters at all, he'd respect the boundary you're setting. It's a big red flag that he makes this one sexual act such a big deal, because it usually means it's not about the pleasure derived from the act itself. More likely it means he gets off on stepping over your boundaries and having undue control over the relationship. That's an abusive attitude, and (if it hasn't already) will turn into full-blown abuse if it isn't stopped.

He has already shown that simply setting the boundary doesn't register with him as something he should respect. I recommend you break up with him, but if that's too daunting for you, at least set an even firmer boundary. Something like ""if you bring up anal we're not having sex that week"". It'll most likely get him to break up with you. He will probably blame you and call you names, but he's in the wrong for disrespecting your (perfectly okay) boundaries."

I will never understand this approach.  For me, I need my partner to WANT to have sex with me.

"OP, I’m going to be really honest with you. 

This is exactly why a lot of men go for younger women. They know they’re still coming into their own, are more impressionable, and eager to please. He’s put you into a position where you feel defeated because he won’t respect your boundaries. There is an inherent power imbalance and this situation is proof. Seven years is nothing when you’re 26 and 33. But a damn near 30 year old man with a girl maybe only two years post high school? Very different, especially if you guys have been together since before you were 20.

My best advice is to leave him. This isn’t important to the relationship, it’s important for him. If you don’t want to, but he absolutely needs it then you’re sexually incompatible and that is ok, see yourself out. But more importantly, you do not want to be with someone who makes you feel like your boundaries are not reasonable. I imagine this isn’t the only boundary you have that he disrespects."

He literally does not care whether or not you are in various kinds of pain, as long as it gives him pleasure. 

I also notice an age gap. Yes you're both adults, but it is enough of an age gap that I suspect that may be a power dynamic there. I wonder if this isn't the only unhealthy aspect to this relationship. 

In any event, anyone who constantly badger you about having sex or a specific sex act needs to go to the dustbin. I don't care how sweet he has been to you or any other thing.

"🚩🚩🚩 Anal sex is an ""important part of the relationship for him""?

That is absolute nonsense if he said that to you or gave you that impression - do not believe it! Anal sex can be a bonus where both parties have consensted and should be enthusiastic to participate. No one should be guilted into anal sex, and it should never be a stipulation for a relationship.

And if anal sex is more important to him than you are, you know where you stand. Your needs, desires, comfort, and feelings will NEVER come first if you choose to stay with him.

I'm speaking from experience. I was in a relationship at age 19 with a guy who was 7 years older. He never stopped ignoring my boundaries, which led to him forcing himself on me on a regular basis, and he tried to baby trap me. It took me 6 years to get away from him. If not having anal sex is YOUR boundary, and he is asking you to compromise it, or he is ignoring it, he will ignore all of your other boundaries as well eventually.

Okay! So my husband and I have been together 10 years (literally today 😅) and he is also an anal guy. We've tried it twice and both times I hated it, so it's just not a topic anymore. He'll ask once in awhile (usually when we've been drinking) and I say nah and he gets over it. No pressure. And it's like twice a year haha. If the dude loves and respects you, he'll stop asking and stop pressuring you.	AScaredChildSadSoul	reply	na	na	na	0.9995033740997314	no	strong	no	na	offmychest	failed

"I’m really sorry you’re not being respected by your partner, and unfortunately this doesn’t bode well. Most couples aren’t 100% sexually compatible, so it’s normal for him to enjoy something like anal and for you not to. His response to learning that info is the issue. Because you don’t want to give someone who has repeatedly shown that he doesn’t understand consent/respect boundaries the opportunity to show you new ways how he doesn’t understand consent/respect boundaries.

He’s old enough to know better and he’s pressuring you because you’re young and he knows he can get away with it. This isn’t your fault, but now you can show him that assumption was wrong. He’s being manipulative, coercive,  and in addition to already being gross, it’s a slippery slope. Because if he’s willing to do this regarding sex (something that should be the epitome of mutual respect, vulnerability, unity, pleasure, and collaboration w/partners), he will continue to break down all your boundaries until you either don’t remember what they were/who you were to begin with, or he does something so extreme that you won’t be able to bear being with him anymore and this will be even harder to heal from. If talking about this over and over hasn’t made it click, then it simply won’t. 

He’s too selfish and it’s not within your power to “fix him.” He may grow some day, but you’ll waste your youth trying to make that happen for you. If he ever does change someday it’ll be because he wants to/is ready to and you’re going to be collateral if you stay in the meantime. I say this because your experience is sadly not unique. As someone who used to allow men to do this to me and a witness to it with friends/fam, spare yourself the long way out.

He should let you show him just once what those first few minutes of anal feel like. It's always awful, even if it gets better after awhile.

"These comments make me realize just how weird and quick to avoid problems some of you are by telling her to end the relationship with this guy. Really? Have you guys ever been in a relationship? They are having a disagreement and she is looking for advice on how to help him understand that she really does not want to do that kind of stuff in the bedroom. That is it. These types of disagreements exist in every relationship. Had she said that he hits her or even verbally abuses her when she says she isn't up for anal sex then that is a way different situation but c'mon. 
This dude is probably a good bf who enjoys anal and does not understand that she is not up for it. That is an issue that can be solved without them having to end the relationship.

Ok so first off I am a male so this advice is coming from a male and is only my opinion. So as much as you may not want to do it just realize he does want to. Now with that I’m not saying to do it by any means because at the end of the day its your body and your choice but I say that to mean that a relationship is a give and take so what I recommend is to just explain that you don’t want that and you’re not comfortable but ask him if there is anything else you may be able to do for him. By doing this you’re not just shutting down his desires but instead letting him see that you understand he has desires and you want to make each other happy but it has to be comfortable for both. Just saying no constantly may be the beginning of the end. Again I’m not saying to do anything you’re uncomfortable with at all my only advice is try to make him understand and maybe offer him something in return. And that goes for both sides of the relationship when you have an ask.	AScaredChildSadSoul	reply	na	na	na	0.9995033740997314	no	no	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.
"saying it hurts just sounds like you are doing it wrong, if you have tried it before and it hurt and the only reason you won't do it is because of the pain then it would be beneficial to do research and see exactly how to do it without any pain, it will feel good if there isn't any pain.

Your boyfriend might be pushy because it sounds like you just don't want to do it because of the pain and it being uncomfortable. Both of those can be fixed if anal is done correctly.

You supplied a problem, but you didn't say a hard no and just take it off the table. You said that it hurts and it's uncomfortable, both of which are fixable.

I don't understand why anyone would want to engage in a sexual act with someone they had to pressure into it.  It is YOUR body.

Please be careful with yourself. 



And please NEVER do anything unless you're enthusiastic about it. Your partner shouldnt want anything less than enthusiasm either. So set your boundaries and set them HARD.

"How you talk about this gives me the impression that… you lack some self worth and get validation externally, and esp from your partner. Sweetheart, if that’s the case, that’s not a healthy way to be. Your self worth is inherent and you do NOT need to perform for someone to be worthy of being respected and loved just as you are. I highly recommend setting some boundaries for yourself immediately, and if this idea seems far too overwhelming for you, then I’d suggest seeking some professional guidance if you can.

If suggestions help, this is how I would approach this with your bf:

“Hey, I really need to talk with you. In regards to your desire for anal sex, we are incompatible. This is not an activity that I enjoy in any measure at all. It is never pleasurable for me. It is never fun for me. It is never good for me. I don’t like it, and right now, I have absolutely zero inclination to experience it again. When I have consented in the past, it was solely to make you happy so I could feel I was worth the love you give me, but I’ve come to realize that doing that wasn’t respecting or loving myself, and I can no longer do that. I know this might seem like a sudden change in how I’ve responded before, but the stress of this part of our dynamic is no longer something I can ignore.

So, I’m letting you know that as of right now, anal sex is completely off the table for me. I am unwilling to entertain any comments or requests in regards to this. It is no longer an option. I understand that this act is really important to you, but just as it would be silly to expect you to suddenly not want it, it is silly to expect me to be okay with it when I have simply realized that I am not. I am 100% not okay with it. And I don’t expect you to change your desires but if this component is that important to you in a romantic relationship, then we may need to simply understand that we are incompatible and amicably go our separate ways.”

OP, there are many people out there who don’t want to put stuff up your butt that will have all the other similar qualities of your bf. I do understand that if you’re co-dependent, it will be extremely frightening to even consider the idea of walking away from someone who gives you love over something seemingly so small. But this thing is actually huge, and how I’ve tried to word how to set the boundary for yourself let’s him know exactly how huge this is. How you worded your post gives me the impression that you’ve never given him a hard NO on the subject, so he is likely taking your passiveness as being open to trying, as opposed to knowing how much you actually dislike it, and you feeling overwhelmed because of it. This verbiage will set the tone for the relationship from there on in regards to this one aspect, and also be an indicator of what type of person he is: will he care about you, or will he only care about himself?

Anyways, I feel like this comment is long winded but relationships are complex and complicated, and communicating and advocating for yourself can be extremely daunting if you’ve never learned how. I’m projecting a lot, also, so I could completely be missing the mark! But if any of it rings true, I hope you can glean something useful to take with you.

Good luck, OP, wishing you all the best. ❤️

ETA: be ready to be willing to leave he keeps continuing pressuring you for it if you tell him you are unwilling to hear any comments or requests. That’s the one part about this I forgot to mention. You cannot set a boundary and then let him steamroll over it. If he asks, if he whines, if he complains, then you’re done. Period. Or offer a 3 strikes rule if you’re feeling compassionate, if that makes you feel better."	AScaredChildSadSoul	reply	na	na	na	0.9995033740997314	weak	no	no	na	offmychest	failed

"This happened to me in my last relationship.

This was two years ago and I only recently found the strength to stop blaming myself when my therapist explained to me what coercion is. Please believe me when I say you don't want to be with someone who will pressure you into things you don't want to do. If he keeps trying to convince you after one ""no"", it will never stop. The pain and guilt that comes with being sexually assaulted after months of coercion is unbearable. It should stop at the first ""no"". Don't make the same mistake I did by waiting until you don't have any fight left. You are more than enough as you are, don't ever feel like you need to bend to his needs to be valuable. You have so much value just by being you, and no one can take that from you. But he can take your peace if you don't stop this in its tracks.

"Had this problem around your age.

I tried the same, offering solutions like numbing lube; which he said destroys the point even if it was only temporary, for the sake of trying to get my body used to it. Offered to get stretching kits but he couldn’t stand the thought of me inserting anything other than his dick. (He stole/ got rid a vibrator I purchased before I met him and he didn’t even like fingering me.) Eventually when I explained to my ex that it confused me how he could be into something that was so incredibly painful and unenjoyable for me; he basically admitted that kind of control over me was part of why he was into it. 

After being with my current husband, I’ve learned that if your partner truly cares about your pleasure; they genuinely will not enjoy something that is uncomfortable/painful for you. Even when it’s something they might have previously liked; it will not turn them on if they don’t see it doing the same for you. This is regardless of if there is a dom/sub/vanilla dynamic. I’m primarily a sub who loves to please, so with my ex I felt compelled to attempt to give into his whims- despite the pain and humiliation. Sometimes I would break down and cry due to the pain and embarrassment of not being able to withstand it until he finished. With my current dom partner; he is very active in making sure that I’m comfortable at all times. Before him and I ever had sex, he made it a point to have an affectionate discussion about what I’m comfortable with and what I enjoy most. Due to my past with anal, he has never asked this of me- and he makes it a point to be more loving to the areas of myself that have been neglected and/or hurt in the past, emotionally and physically. 

You’re young. If he is this persistent and has not shown any signs of letting up out of consideration and care for you, then dump him. While it could only be evident in your sex life right now; this will speak to a larger issue of him overlooking your personal needs and boundaries. You deserve a partner who looks to find out what those are first, before they even have the privilege of knowing your body so intimately . REMEMBER! IT IS A PRIVILEGE AND THE RIGHT PARTNER WILL MAKE SURE TO SHOW YOU THEY APPRECIATE IT!! 💖 Good luck!

For any sexual encounter to count as sex it needs to have mutual enthusiastic consent and participation from both parties/old parties.

If you find yourself so uncomfortable that you no longer participate and that it’s just lwt it happen  to you that is no longer sex at all.

Completely agree on this. From previous relationships, I love anal, wife set a boundary that she does not want anal, and guess what I don't bring it up.  If it was a deal breaker for me I would have walked away from our relationship long ago.  It sounds like due is being toxic to me.  If it was that important to him he would not/should not be with OP.

Also anal is not enjoyable for women unless you're relaxed and mentally turned on. The first time you did anal with him was probably rushed and him pressuring  you makes it worse. He could make it an enjoyable experience for you, he just likes it when it hurts OP. So that adds into his abusive attitude.

"Agreed. I was basically in the same situation as OP once. Only my partner wasn’t directly asking me for it after a point but kept making “jokes” about “going in the wrong hole”, sending memes about “surprise” anal, etc. even after explaining that it was something he would not get from me. Which is obviously concerning and it made me not trust him in the bedroom. 

(We talked about it very early on and he manipulated me into staying with him by lying anf saying it was not important for him sex wise) 

Ultimately he began to withhold regular sex from me as a “silent punishment” for not fulfilling his fantasy for anal sex. (Which of course your partner doesn’t OWE you sex, but it felt worse because it was clear that it was to hurt me) And although I tried talking to him again again about it, he would gaslight me. And eventually it lead to a total dead bedroom relationship. It wasn’t entirely the downfall of the relationship, but it was definitely the beginning of the end.

Anal sex can be very enjoyable and if done correctly should not be painful at all. It takes warmup, lot's of lubrication and that only after training yourself with smaller objects (fingers, toys etc.).

"I know it feels like a long time, but in the majority of your life, this is not a long time, and trust me whnen I say the longer you stay with this man, the more time you will waste. You absolutely can find someone better than ""isn't so bad."" There is someone out there who is *wonderful* for you. Your boyfriend is coercing you into a sexual act, and even if you comply, that is not consent. Your significant other should not be assaulting you—and that is what he is doing.

I know it is funny to joke about, but this situation is serious. The way he is acting, he is chipping away at you. He might wear you down and you might agree again to something you don't want to do, and when he gets what he wants and knows he can pressure you to agree, then he will find something else and wear you down to do that, and so on and so on. This man does not care about your wants or your needs, but only his own satisfaction.

You are very young, and the age gap is troublesome. Seven years might not seem like a lot, but with the way he is behaving, it gives off red flags that he wants to be with you because he thinks he can condition and mold you to be who he wants.

Don't waste your time—because when this relationship ends, you won't just have wasted the time with someone who is not a good partner, but you will have to spend time building yourself back up. Start that now. Focus on what makes *you* happy and go find someone who cares about what *you* want. Don't settle for ""isn't that bad,"" because if you are saying that, he actually is that bad."

again it’s not because you guys aren’t sexually compatible that people are telling you to leave. it’s that he’s ignoring a huge sexual boundary and that is a huge red flag in any relationship. while it can be worked out because some men and women don’t truly grasp consent  as much as they should sometimes it is something they will not or refuse to grasp and ignore their partner on purpose. you don’t need to leave him but you do need to make sure he understands you are not going to give him this and he needs to be okay with that and not pressure you. set a strict boundary and make sure he knows there are consequences if he pressures you, such as disengaging from sex, having a talk or not doing anything until he understands this boundary. he needs to know you’re not playing around and this is sexual coercion to continue to push you into a sex act you do not want	AScaredChildSadSoul	reply	na	na	na	0.9995033740997314	weak	no	no	na	offmychest	failed
Thing is, this isn't going to go away.  I was in your shoes.  Husband wanted anal, I tried it, didn't want it, he still wanted it. Constantly tried it, then got sneaky and started trying it while I was asleep.  I would wake up with him in me.  It was horrible. He just had to have it.  We ended up divorcing and I suddenly had a fear of anal.  I am not the type to live with fear.  I face it.  Took me years to work past the fear.  Now it's one of my favorite activities.

"> He'a a good guy with a lot of going on on his head.

That doesn't mean you're required to stick around or fix him.

When I was your age, I started dating a guy the same age as your boyfriend.  He was diagnosed bipolar but didn't like the way his meds made him feel, so he wouldn't take them.  He was an alcoholic; but I didn't recognize that until I was older.  He'd been abused as a child and never worked out any of those issues-- he hated therapy and therapists.  He struggled to hold a job, so I paid for most of our expenses.  He'd been in prison in the past for assault.

He also (surprise) had an obsession with anal.  He pressured me and pressured me until I gave in and let him try-- so he tries to go in with no prep and just lube; and he's not small; and even just him pushing a bit hurt like crazy and I was crying and crying.  After a minute or two of attempts, he screamed at me that I was ""ruining his fantasy"" and took off drunk for like 36 hours.  Came back the ""good guy"".  I was like, *well it's not his fault he was abused as a kid and he can't help his preferences in bed*.  I bottled it up and we moved on.

I thought this was acceptable back then; but it's really not-- he needed to take responsibility for his mental health.  It doesn't matter that he's a good guy if the times he's not he turns into an abusive guy; or a violent guy; or a guy who doesn't treat you with any dignity or respect.  No amount of ""good guy""ing makes up for the times he's a guy who prioritizes 10 minutes of fantasy and an orgasm over the entirety of your mental well-being and the possibility of injuring you.

I don't know what ""a lot going on in his head"" means to you; but it certainly shouldn't mean he gets a pass for being rapey sometimes.  He's not your responsibility; you can't help him with anything going on in his head if he doesn't want the help; and there's a major difference between being incompatible in bed and having a partner who doesn't always care if you're feeling good about things.  Trust me when I say you will have a ton of emotions to sort out once you hit 27, yourself, and realize the kind of person you'd have to be to treat a 20 year old the way your boyfriend treats you when he slips.

I would leave this relationship. He doesn’t actually care about you. If he did he would never pressure you to do something during sex. No would be enough. 

To put in perspective, I’ve been with my partner for ten years and he has NEVER pressured me to do something I didn’t want to do. If he wants to fry something new he asks me first and if I say no then that’s it (won’t ask over and over and respects my no). If I say yes he checks in to make sure I’m still okay.

People have different bodies, so what feels good for one person might not feel good to another. Some people like their nipples played with, others don't. Some people have sensitive cervixes and others don't. Some women can enjoy and orgasm with anal, others will find it intolerable.

There's very little chance of enjoying anal if you aren't ready, warmed up, and totally enthusiastic. It's very hard for those muscles to relax unless you feel safe and aroused.

"Hi everyone, by the title you can probably tell that I’m about to talk about how annoying it is to look like a 3rd grader when I’m 16. 
I think this is especially worse for me as a guy because at my age everyone around me has already had a major growth spurt, are growing facial hair, and overall look more “manly.” This is frustrating because I still look like a elementary schooler. I’m short (5’3”) and I have a childish facial features like a rounder face, chubbier cheeks, and no facial/body hair whatsoever. Everywhere I go people confuse me for a younger person, get surprised when I tell them I’m 16, and ask “are you sure you’re in this grade?” This has even resulted in girls not even looking at me or seeing me a little child rather than someone actually at their age. This isn’t really a big problem as I don’t really want to date anyway but it’s really frustrating when I talk to one and they say “you’re so cute!” Or “you look like my little brother.” This doesn’t weigh on me too much but it just makes that issue even more obvious. My friends always laugh at how young I look and although it’s just a joke and I can play along, it’s annoyingly true.

"I (18F) recently had a situationship fail... this guy (19M) was a jerk to say the least, had really problematic political views and life ideals, frequently ignored me, would say everything was ok when it wasn't, and would blame me for not respecting him with things I never knew bothered him, because he never told me. We had this thing going on for 4 months, and I fell deeply in love with him, and he knew (I said I loved him and he didn't say it back), I also always took the initiative in everything, asked him out on dates, planned things, started conversations and difficult ones if we had to communicate to solve a problem... everything. 

Well... We had 3 fights in a row pretty much, all of them regarding politics and with me telling him I thought his opinions were ignorant due to him having a very close minded view of things (he's pretty rich). He got very offended at me saying that, and apparently it was a deal breaker to him. He said I didn't respect him as I hung out with male friends who had interest in me (none of them disrespected the fact I was in love, so they never hit on me when I was with this guy), that I didn't respect him when I asked if it was okay for me to check out a clothing-optional beach (he said it was okay and even then I didn't go), and that I didn't respect him when venting to my friends about how he made me feel (I usually cried almost every day because he gave me mixed feelings). All of this while he said we never dated or had anything serious, even with him being very jealous of me, calling me pet names, saying he adored me and not getting with anybody else. 

He broke things off with me with the excuse of the fights making us both feel really upset, and I accepted it, but later on found out my best friend wasn't sure if she had feelings for him (they had gotten really close). I was filled with rage, and it got worse as I found out he constantly mistreated me, but he always denied that. We ended up having an ugly fight, and now I don't talk to both of them, but I still love him so much... I miss him so much... I know he has an awful personality, but I just miss the good moments where I felt loved...

I know I'm being stupid, even after he got up in my face twice during our fight, even after he said I lied many times when all I did was tell the truth, even after he said I exaggerated what really happened when all I did was tell friends how he made me feel with his mixed signals... Even after he gaslit me many times, called me crazy, disregarded my past trauma and treated it as it was nothing, looked at me with disgust and showed himself as a narcissist... Maybe it's my BPD, I don't know, but I never loved someone this way, and I know I can't, but if I could go back in time and just do everything to keep him with me, I would, even being aware of his toxicity... He blamed me for losing him, I know it's not true, but deep down I believe it is...

I love him so much, I miss him so much, I'm crying because of the pain, and because I know I can't go back, I can't bow down to him... I don't know how to get over him, I just wanted to be loved the way I love him..."	fishycomet	post	23.88107115650343	female	White	0.9979438185691833	na	na	na	1	offmychest	no prediction.

"Sounds almost identical to what happened to me in 2017. Living with the love of my life about to get married when one night changed my entire world. Almost the exact same charges as well.

For anyone seeing the charges and immediately judging this person I would caution you to remember the world isn’t black and white.

For me it was a psychosis induced event due to undiagnosed schizophrenia where I literally thought that the world was ending and that if I didn’t keep my girlfriend from leaving that she was going to die. Voice in my head saying: “if you leave she is going to die”

Harming the people you love because you love them is not something I wish for anyone on planet earth to ever have to go through. Doing things you thought you would never do and then being faced with the reality of situation when the curtain drops… I tried to kill myself in the jail but they put me into the psych ward with nothing to keep me company but the weight of my entire life crashing down.

I never got to speak to them again. Never got to explain why. To this day I haven’t even considered being in another relationship. I wound up moving across the country and left an entire career behind. Those kinds of charges are looked at exactly how some of the replies in this post are.

I don’t even know what happened in your scenario OP, maybe you did what you did for reasons that are un similar to mine but I’ll give you some advice.

Let them go for good. If you ever speak again let it be them who contacts you and if they never do then leave it where it is. I’m sure you’re already considering the day the restraining order falls off and what you’ll say.

Stop.

Life comes in lessons and here’s the one you were supposed to learn. If it was this intense and you got let off easy then the universe was kind to you and basically said:

“OP instead of putting a bullet in your head I’m going to back hand you so hard that you realize who you are messing with. You’ll lose almost everything, but I’m giving you one more chance to change your life around. Now start doing what you are supposed to do… not what you WANT to do.”

Since I got out of jail I got a masters in clinical mental health and became a domestic abuse counselor teaching classes for people who committed domestic or family violence. I learned that if I wanted to feel good about my life it was going to be because I was going to give back to the world I had taken from my whole life.

I’ll leave you with this thing called the:

“Law of one”

In its simplest version it basically states that everyone has free will, but that if you fuck with anyone else’s free will you will accrue karma.

It’s a lesson in honesty.

For example if you are dating someone and living together and you tell them you are going to hang out with your friends, but then go sleep with someone on tinder… you have completely derailed that persons free will with your lie.

They wouldn’t be with you, live with you, talk to you, etc. IF they knew the truth. Your lie completely removes their ability to make choices and assert their will.

So the question now is: What was the dishonesty playing out in your life before this situation and was the punishment you received for it enough to make you start living an honest life?"	JohnRoscoe03	reply	na	na	na	0.9900130033493042	weak	strong	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.
"As a defense attorney and former prosecutor...  I would set down with a pen and paper and make a list.  A to do list.  I would prioritize items based on how urgently they need accomplishing. 

So figuring out food and shelter is top.  Even if it means reaching out to a homeless shelter for a few days, or couchsurfing for a bit.  

Then I would work out employment.  You need money.  Plus, people (especially the courts a d probation) I'll look favorably upon someone that is working.  Even if it means that you have to sign up for a job you are over qualified for, in order to have a job while you continue to search for better employment.

Then I would work out your social support network.  No man is an island.  I would consider visiting with a therapist if it's needed (I don't know your circumstances), or perhaps attending a church.  Clergy are trained to provide spiritual support to parishioners without cost, and in a pinch can stand in for a therapist until you could get a therapist lined up.  Churches are also a good place to find community; which in turn could open up options for everything from employment to food to shelter.

On the community track, I would figure out who you can rely upon emotionally.  Close family, friends, figure out who these people are.  And as iron sharpens iron, so one man Sharpens another.  So be careful to surround yourself with people that will be a moral positive and uplifting force for you.  Even if it means leaving criminally-inclined friends behind. 

Summed up shortly; use your priority list to make a plan.  Stick to the plan.  This displine will provide you with both the structure you need as well as the tools to be successful.  You can work through this for a better life OP."	JohnRoscoe03	reply	na	na	na	0.9900130033493042	no	strong	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.
It’s normal to feel that way. A lot of what has changed depends on how long you were incarcerated, so just take things slow and take the time to notice the beautiful things in this world.

"Do better and be better. My motto for life is 'progress not perfection'

My Dad finally agreed to being medicated for his bipolar but prior to that he has been a perpetrator of domestic violence. 

He has such severe delusions when he's unmedicated and genuinely comes across as insane at some points.

He's done a lot of messed up thing but has spent the past 10 years working to be better.

I don't expect his victims to forgive him, I have a hard time forgiving him some days. It's hard separating mental illness from the person.

When my mh was garbage, I said and did some messed up things. Predominantly ghosting people who loved me and I loved as well. 

I obviously don't know the circumstances for you but you should be aware that people will judge you harshly.

My partner has a record and although it's nothing violence/assault related, he has been told by many people that he's less than them because they're not felons.

"I’m glad you’re free. Feeling substantial remorse after something like this occurring is healthy. 

I was in a similar circumstance about a year ago. My ex of 7yrs and I broke up but we continued to cohabitate. There was lots of emotional abuse on both sides, and it culminated in a night of heavy drinking and drug use where I went through her phone and discovered she’d been cheating on me prior to the breakup. I broke her cellphone, and she called the police on me. I received a domestic violence destruction of property charge and spent the night in jail.

You learn a lot about yourself through this process. I was required to take DV courses and finished up this past week. I feel good about what I’ve learned, and I’m with a partner who I have a much healthier relationship with now. 

Things like this cause you to rethink your self-worth and other aspects of your identity. Try to remember that while you behaved extremely poorly, if this was out of the ordinary, one moment in your life doesn’t define you as a person. Now be better.

The way you worded this honestly scares me. It feels like you don't have any remorse or shame in what has happened and only that you feel happier and feel free now. You may feel free and happy now, but the person you hurt, I guarantee, doesn't feel happy.  What you did mentally to that person will never go away, and I hope if you had any shame or remorse, it never leaves you either. I truly hope you never forgive yourself so that you never become complacent and allow yourself to do it again to someone else. More than worrying about the time you are missing, I hope you think about the time you took from that person. The mental damage done to someone through abuse stops their life, too. You can't go back to who you were, and you can't get back the time stolen from who you would have been if someone hadn't done that to you. I truly hope from the bottom of my heart you leave that poor person alone and stay away from them. Having been in the position of the person you hurt before it doesn't seem like you learned a lesson or ever will. The only kindness you can do is never show up in front of them ever again.

Imagine believing one awful action defines who someone is forever. Im not defending him, he did something absolutely awful, something that will scar that poor woman for life, but does that mean he can’t work on himself and be a better person? Does this one action define the entire rest of his life? Do you know if he suffered a mental break that caused this? Do you know why this happened and what lead to it? He should NEVER have done what he did, but don’t pretend you know everything when you don’t.

"The entire US (and Canadian) justice system was founded on the principle that people can and do change. Rehabilitation. If OP is genuine in his remorseand is committed to change, then the purpose of his sentence has been fulfilled.  

From my experience with criminal law,, DV defendants (that are guilty) can usually be categorized as either one or two categories.  The first are the sociopaths, devoid of empathy.  The second are the remorseful.  These people are genuinely devastated mentally and emotionally by the actions that they themselves have committed.  OP's statements would seem to place him in the later category; I wouldn't lose sleep over whether OP sleeps well at night or not.  

Which is why we need to be mindful of former criminals that are attempting to rebuild on the right foot.  We want to use this opportunity to help build them back as better people.

My sister does not like sharing her stuff. Growing up, if I ever did, then she would have a break down. Today I saw her car wasn’t home and I simply wanted to use her lash curler for 2 seconds and put it back where I found it. As I was about to use it, she came in to the room and yelled at me. I said I was borrowing it and putting it back. She got super mad and started yelling at me. Even thought I apologized she was having the worst breakdown of her life. Slamming doors, breaking things in the house, screaming bloody murder in the front of the house. She was threatening me. It was just horrifying. I didn’t know if she was gonna hurt herself or me. I had to call the police. I also was scared that she would ruin my belongings in a rage like she usually does. Anyways the police did nothing but it helped calm her down. And I think it shocked her that I called the police. But, I did it bc I wanted her to know that reacting like that is not okay and makes me worry for her and my safety. I’m now left sad and drained. It never feels good having to do this to a family member, but it is also so exhausting having to live like this. I always feel like I’m in egg shells. I am depressed and I feel trapped.

"You are not the victim here. Like especially a lash curler is not something to be shared can easily transfer infections that way. You knew she absolutely hates it when you touch her stuff so why do you touch her stuff? Doesn’t matter if you’re borrowing it you didn’t ask because you knew she’d say no. Yea she flipped out but I wonder just how many times she’s told you not to touch her stuff and you just don’t listen so she doesn’t know any other way to make you listen besides freaking out on her but clearly that doesn’t work either. I bet she also can’t wait until you move out.

In a couple days I (23f) have to see the dermatologist to get a mole checked out and removed from my finger. Sounds simple enough right? It shouldn’t be too bad. But I’m still scared and hate having to go to the doctor’s (who even likes it?) I asked my mom (52f) to come with me for emotional support, and she said I’m old enough to go alone. It hurt. My dad isn’t alive anymore and he always used to accompany me to any doctor’s appointments, no matter how minor. Maybe it makes me immature but it made me feel better. Put my mind at ease. They wouldn’t even have to come in, just be in the waiting room is good enough for me. I feel like a scared child stuck in an adult’s body. There’s also the fear that this stupid little mole might be something worse, and my mom doesn’t take me seriously at all. I’m just scared and I hate it.

I have had a skin check. On something that was suspicious to me but ended up not being a problem, but they found something on my left shoulder blade that I would have never seen.  They took a quick biopsy. Didn't hurt  & came back melanoma.  They caught it early and I had surgery to take it out and I have about a 4-in scar.

If they do need to remove anything, they numb it up and while they do they have you hold a little vibrating metal item elsewhere to trick your brain so you don’t feel the needle pokes. Then the removal is fast and easy. I understand the anxiety surrounding this, but you’re doing the right thing getting it checked out. Also, feel free to express that you feel nervous to the doctor.

"This morning on the way to work I started my car like any other day. I heard a strange noise under my car but didn’t feel anything. I slowly pulled out of the street and when I looked back, there was a poor little cat. It was flailing around and flopping, having a seizure. I instantly knew that it either had gotten in my engine or I ran it over. 
I’m absolutely devastated. I take care of feral cats in my large backyard, but have never seen this poor little guy. The ones I take care of know to stay away from the cars and never hide under/around them. Take off far away when they hear car doors open or shut. 
This little one wasn’t one of mine, and he didn’t know :( I called animal services hoping that they could come pick him up and euthanize him so he wouldn’t have to suffer, but of course they didn’t show up until 6 hours later. I had to watch the poor baby suffer and couldn’t do anything about it.

The hardest thing would have been the most Humane thing, and that would have been to put the animal down yourself. Yeah I know killing an animal is hard but instead you let it suffer for 6 hours. There's no fault in what you did by just starting your car and backing up. But sometimes the best thing we can do in a case like this is something suffering by making it quick.

If I had a way of doing it without getting the police called on me for gunshots or if I had a supply of Euthasol I would’ve done it myself.

"My wife—we gonna get married real soon. 
We’ve been together for a while, and she’s one of those girls that constantly analyzing shit for no reason. Like, she would always analyze little minute details like the way a certain person speaks, or someone’s body language or someone’s facial cues etc. She’s the most insane overthinker I’ve ever met. It’s extremely unhealthy for her, but it’s almost habit, an addiction that doesn’t stop. Normally, a partner would’ve feel “scared” to tell their partner about something that disgusts or bothers them, but i express my frustration or disgust; she will over think the heck out. After spending years with this women, trust me when I say this, she will tell herself something like, “Oh he thinks he’s more high and mighty” or “oh he hates me”. I get it! We’re adults. It’s okay pass gas. First time, it was cute. But 4th time, now I’m getting disgusted. We used a weighted blanket so the smell tends get trapped and lingers for a while.

"My dad is verbally abuse. He is the kind of man that if got in an argument with my mom (and this has happened countless times) would make her sleep on the couch. He doesn’t even let her go grocery shopping-very controlling. But lately he has been insulting me about my weight and basically just where I am at in life right now. I guess being 27 yr old and a registered nurse living with a roommate in an apartment is not good enough for him. During my therapy session today my therapist made me realize all the aspects of myself that I have low self esteem were installed by him. I just always have this thought that I am not a good person. He always states that he knows everything and can never apologize. I have never heard him say “I’m sorry.” Also, it took him like 15 years to say he loved me and he only did so because he thought he was going to die (health issue). He is the reason I have such issues with men and low self esteem. I know this is an awful think to wish…but sometimes I do wish he was dead because then my mom would finally be free of him and I can have a normal life.

"Firstly, I am an teenager with usual stress of a lot of examinations and career. I am saying my problem here not for any medical health advice but because it is just so weird that probably a lot of the people won't even get it and probably leave midway. First sign of this problem occurred when I was very young where one day I started yawning without being able to stop. It sounds weird yes, but the problem was that no matter what I did, how much I slept, I couldn't stop. As a kid this terrifying as it not only prevented me from sleeping (had a yawn as soon as I was about to sleep which woke me up) but when I didn't yawn, it made me breath deeply causing my chest to pain. This made me really depressed as a kid. Eventually it stopped as I was prescribed with a medicine which acted as a placebo and I also used to watch my fav TV show all day long which made it slowly go way with me thinking my health condition improved (though I didn't have any). Though it did return from time to time every few years but didn't last as long as it did initially (initially it was 3 months). 

Now, last month I had a similarly weird but much much much worse problem where couldn't stop swallowing weirdly. Firstly, I swallow weirdly, where instead of swallowing normally where you don't feel anything, I swallow extremely hard which feels like something is punching my throat from inside. And that too continuously, every other second. This gets quite painful in my throat eventually, makes me nauseated and is extremely uncomfortable and also as soon as I am about to sleep, it feels like something just punched my throat. Didn't tell my parents about this as it was weird problem. But don't know how many of my nights it ruined (and will ruin) with me wishing good night sleep without this nightmare. At one point I got so depressed and hopeless that I thought ending my self would be the only solution to get rid of this curse. Though I did start gaming around that time, made on some great friends, started watching late night streams and this helped me a lot with fighting this. But this problem made afraid of going to sleep.

Now I guess it did improve eventually last year giving me hope, but returned mildly after some months making me scared and depressed again. Eventually going through that phase, and ruining 2 of my precious months again. It now returned again at full force. Now I don't even know what to think. Currently it is already morning while I am typing this. After some months I have a really important examinations, and then a month later another really important competitive examination. It's just that, I was so productive, great student, had a great life a year ago and don't know how a single problem and depression ruined me this bad. Probably I am just whining but I just wanted to pass some time until I am extremely tired so that I can hopefully sleep. Thanks for reading. Have a great day."

"my (23f) dad (70m) is heavily depressed and i don’t know how to help. him and my mom are divorced, have been for around 6-7 years now. he moved to a state that is very difficult for me to get to (think alaska if i were to live in like florida, that type of distance) two years ago because he’s always wanted to live there, but he has no friends or family in that state. i can only visit him once or twice a year.

he battled cancer last year and while he’s in the clear now, it’s left him with some significant deformities. he lost a lot of money after getting involved with someone he shouldn’t have. now every time we call, he tells me his financial concerns, and he sounds so depressed. a few weeks ago he alluded to having suicidal thoughts and i blew up and begged him to not do that to me and to please seek help. he says he has and it’s helped somewhat, but the man is not happy. he recently picked up a menial job to supplement his income, but he hated that too.

i don’t know what i can do and i’m scared. i’ve suggested him moving closer to me (which would be the state he lived in prior to moving) but he doesn’t seem interested. it kills me to see him like this and i feel so fucking helpless. i don’t want him to kill himself but i can’t move to where he is, i have built a life where i am now. i wish he’d just try to take some

"So, i feel i have to be the common factor, but i’m not sure what I can be doing for this. 

My first “ex” is not really an ex, she was a long time friend I fell in love with. She rejected me, and to put it short i took time away from the friendship to work on my feelings, which she didn’t take well. Eventually we came back as friends as my romantic feelings went back to platonic. 


Well, this past year she wasn’t satisfied with the time i was putting into our friendship, which yes it’s true we were long distance, I had a new girlfriend, and i started a demanding new job. She told me was walking away from our friendship and that she was angry with me. i’ve heard from mutual friends she pretty much “hates my guts” and i don’t know why. this was about 9 months ago she ended our friendship. 

well, now my latest ex, recently dumped me as well because she didn’t feel the same anymore. i’m heartbroken, as I really loved her and fell into another one sided situation. she wanted to stay friends but i told her i needed space first, well, i’ve also once again have heard how much she is upset as well. 

i feel foolish because why can’t i see what im doing wrong? I feel like with my ex friend i was definitely under communicating, and not expressing how busy i really was, and with my recent ex i OVER communicated. 

the only common thing these two shared is they hardly communicated what they needed from me, and let things build up and eventually left."	Solarmomo	post	31.957145180956523	male	White	0.9985641837120056	na	na	na	1	offmychest	failed

"I’m 30, everyone around me (friends) is now in a relationship and/or getting married. I like to be alone, do my own things, but I’ve been single for a year now and my gaming buddies are barely playing anymore since they got married or whatever. So generally I wake up, do my job from home, do some chores, sit down and play videogames alone. My friends primarily spend time with their spouses so we don’t text as much as we used to either. I’ll be picking up gym as another hobby soon but still… it’s lonely. I started a diet and building a workout plan and try and focus on improving myself in every way but I’m ready for a relationship. I want to share my life, my joy, my experiences with someone. I want to love someone and I want to be loved but it’s not happening. Dating apps just keep ruining my self esteem and mental health even though I think there aren’t problems with my looks either.


So I have the freetime I always wanted, I have the money I always wanted but everything feels so blank and empty and meaningless. I’m not dismissing anything, I’m more than thankful for what I have but I can’t say I’m happy as I want more than this. I want to go for a walk with someone, I want to cheer someone up, I want to surprise someone, I want to share my passions/hobbies with someone, I want to wake up next to someone I love, I want to make plans with someone I love.

"See a behavioral health therapist to get help with meeting people. You sound like an excellent catch-to-be, employed, fit or will be soon, a good friend. The therapist can help because the skills to meet new people are different from those for deepening a relationship once you’ve started on. Like getting a job takes different skills than doing the job, so get some help from a career coach to get the job even if you have all the skills to do the job once you have it. 

In the meantime, reduce gaming time and use it to go places where people do things you like doing (or would like to be doing). It can be as simple as walking on local trails. Or cooking or learning French or martial arts or a book club. An interesting game (sort of a game) is to practice different personas. The assertive you, the persuasive you, the active listening you, the well-dressed you, the flamboyant you. That is, build your repertoire of how you show up to people.

"There's a lot to uncover here that I don't even know where to start... I'm gonna try my best to be coherent and on track. 

My partner's family is already quite notorious for their attitudes and tendencies. The mother and the sisters especially. So much so that this statement is a warning to me from the father's side, and sure enough, it was confirmed when I started visiting my partner's house. 

I even witnessed these episodes. And got another confirmation from a coworker who happened to be a childhood classmate of my SO's youngest sister, who said she is some fine bully at school (honestly revolting, disgusting. Ew.) 

Moving forward, my partner (M32) is in his 3rd year of college before graduating as a Mechanical Engineer. He already has 3 kids (13, 11, 8) from a previous relationship and had to stop going to college at 19. And his father's wish to us is that he wants him to finish college first before we get married, which I understood. 

Regardless of that statement, I was already planning to start on the pill. And I did. For a good entirety of the relationship. But my partner is quite fond of babies and would often ask me to give him one and that starting early (for me, he says) is better for me. 
I would then smile and just nod. Until at one point, he somehow made me convince to get off the pill as it is giving me spotting for months and mood swings. But then I got back on track 2 weeks after. 

But then turns out that's when the pregnancy happened, somewhere in the 2 weeks I was off the pill. 

A month later that's when we found out I was pregnant. My mother wanted to make us official and have a civil wedding at least and upon bringing the news to my SO's father the highlight of his reply is

""Well... *My name* is already aware that I want you to finish college first."" 

Basically putting the responsibility on me as if I am the man in the relationship. As if it doesn't take two people to make a fucking baby. And to be blunt, as if I was the one who was incessant on wanting a kid. 

That's when it all started, initially his father instructed us to tell the rest of their family when we go back home (we were out of town on a late birthday vacation for my SO) but proceeded to tell them online instead. 

I'm not friends with his Mom and 2 sisters on Facebook. I added the mom back then, but she deleted the request, I don't know if it's intentional or what. Didn't care anymore. 
I didn't receive any message from them or any sentiment given to my SO at least. And I honestly wasn't a bit surprised. 

By the time our visit to the doctor frequents and my pregnancy turned out to be high-risk due to my Type 2 Diabetes. My SO regularly updates his father (and I'm well aware he also tell this to the rest of the family )to which he only respond with a nonchalant ""ok"" At this point I started to feel excluded and tad disappointed. 

My SO and I had a talk about it and he expressed his disappointment and I mustered the courage as well to agree and confessed how I felt about everything. That once I give birth I might not want to establish familial relationship with them nor let them see my baby (unless my SO brings the kid over to them without my knowledge, that's okay). Cause they chose to not be involved in our lives, they know my SO is still in college and they don't want him to stop going. So in order to fund our needs, my SO either needs to start working or we receive temporary assistance from them while he finish his final year and him getting a job, which will take a year and a half. 

But 2 weeks has passed and multiple updates of my status and visit to the doctor, there's no mention of assistance whatsoever. Not even financial support, the least they can give is emotional support. But I guess the latter is just as expensive. 

My SO and I even got into a huge fight where I ended up screaming-crying and was put in so much stress, this is right before I miscarried. 
The fight part is another subject, a lot has been revealed. 

Fast forward, I miscarried. It was really painful and had a huge impact for me, it was my first baby and I was really excited and expecting her/him.

Even with that news I only got the 2nd sister's sympathy and a messy ""how are you?"" From my SO's father and ever since, I couldn't see them the same as before. And it seems like my hate and disgust goes a long way... I don't know if I ever will get over this. I hope I would, but right now I'm hurt and disappointed."	nicoless88	post	22.435849592564338	male	White	0.9921090006828308	na	na	na	1	offmychest	failed
I'd definitely go LC to NC because that's horrible. Having no support when pregnant or having a miscarriage is disgusting. This is brought into stark clarity when you have people like SO and their family in your corner. I wouldn't wish that on anyone. Losing your baby at any stage is heartbreaking. I wouldn't be in a better place mentally if it weren't for the support of my husband and our families. Tell your SO to stand up for you and your relationship because you didn't get it when you were pregnant, and now you need it more than ever. You're getting the shit end of the stick from SO's family because he knocked someone up when he was younger and dropped out of college. He's now back in school, almost done, has 3 kids now, and wants more w/o thinking about the emotional, financial, etc. components. History just repeated itself, but he didn't support his family like he did last time, and he and his family fucked you over. He did an emotionally manipulative campaign so you would agree to get pregnant because fuck the consequences. At no point did he or his family give two shits about how this situation affects you. They just care about themselves. You deserve so much better than how they're treating you, OP.	nicoless88	reply	na	na	na	0.9921090006828308	weak	strong	no	na	offmychest	failed

Title says it all. I'm only 19 and fucking done. I'm done with this situation, done with my family, college, my sex drive, my bisexuality, my Asperger's syndrome, my muslim background and identity crisis. I hate everyone and everything. I just wanna die. I just want to forget, to lose control. My cowardly ass doesn't even dare to purchase drugs and overdose. I fucking hate everything.

The truth is I attempted suicide two years ago and survived by sheer fucking luck. Vomitted all the pills, must be some loving God's work isn't it? My family doesn't even know. They don't know ANYTHING about me. They aren't prepared to deal with shit. Fuck those boomers.

I am physically free but I feel scammed and trapped by life. I feel like everyone has gathered to bite me in the ass. My friend apologized to me via Instagram months ago after a fight where she was clearly in the wrong and I blocked her, now we sit at two opposite sides of the class in uni. FUCK HER, I DESPICE HER. I don't miss anyone and my body language now shows my hatred for things.

The truth is, I'm traumatized and fed up. By myself, by life, by my suicide attempt. Even my psychiatrist is incredibly unfazed by everything I bring up in therapy.

I despice my childhood pictures and this house I was born in. I hated being a toddler, a child, a tween, a teen. Adulthood is supposed to be about freedom and self discovery, I just feel lost and disappointed.

I fucking hate how everyone both irl and on social media just smile and move on from everything while I constently feel this wave of pain inside of me. Am I sitting on a fucking knife without knowing it??? Why is everyone so relaxed and so zen??

I don't want to find love, I don't want to graduate pharmacy college and find a stable job, I don't want to smile. I don't want to live this life where I'm private about everything and hide everything from my family. I don't want to turn 20. Or 21. Or 22. Or 23."

I’m sorry your therapist seems unbothered. That’s horrible because your feelings really deserve to be taken seriously.

I have struggled with mental illness since I was in middle school. Today I am middle aged, and I am doing much better. Psychiatrists can be rather dispassionate - they are scientists, after all, but they work to find the medication that will help you. Don't give up. Everyone struggles, but there is hope.

"I'm so disappointed. My little sister 19f got knocked up by some fwb 25m and I just found out. She still lives with my parents and cannot financially support herself or her child. Everyone is saying ""it's gonna be ok"", but it's not ok. Her and this guy don't even want a relationship together, so the child is going to be raised with by mentally unstable mother and airhead sister. I love them, but these people have no values or morals. They see absolutely 0 problem with getting pregnant from someone you aren't even in a relationship with, and she doesn't plan on trying to get the father to commit to her. It's just a mess. I'm dissapointed in my family, I'm dissapointed for how he child will be raised. 

The father works as a resturant delivery driver and works in a hospital as a porter on weekends and apparently this is ""good money"". Like yeah maybe as a single 20 something, but not as a father of a child. Neither of these people have good careers, or even values or skills that can instill on the child. Im just so dissapointed. I feel like I'm the only one in my family with my head screwed on. I feel like an outsider. And I just know this child will cause major stress and conflict within my family that I want no part of.

"Last year in February I (f21) had an abortion at 5 and a half months along. Me and my boyfriend (m22) have been together for 2 years now.

I found out at 4.5 months along. When I found out I was shocked but I began to feel like I wanted the baby as the days passed. My boyfriend made it very clear he did not want to have the baby and I respected his decision. I am in love with him and I didn’t want to ruin his life or our relationship. 

I really wanted the baby and he really did not. It took me a month to decide on it and I think I regret my decision. Before I wasn’t fully stable, not broke but not rich. I used that to convince myself that’s why I didn’t want the baby. But now I’m really stable financially and I really regret it. I know it’s more than finances like being enough and being ready. I felt ready, he didn’t. 

When I was pregnant I felt so scared but also weirdly content and happy. Feeling the baby’s kicks, getting the cravings. Going to the doctors appointments, hearing her heartbeat. It was a girl. I just.. can’t get over it.

 I told him I wanted the baby and he told me he didn’t. So I had the abortion. Without my boyfriend. I got one of my close friends to pick me up and I told him not to come. He came the next day with food and helped me around as it made me feel woozy for a week or so. He was really good to me. I also 100% respect his decision in not wanting our child I just really fucking regret it."	millionairepurr	post	19.321599431505206	female	White	0.9950683116912842	na	na	na	14	offmychest	no prediction.

"Last year I met a girl who became a really good friend, at the time I wasn't feeling like having a girlfriend due to a bad experience few months before that, but 3 months ago I was feeling different about her and we started to flirt, I really thought that I was important to her because of things she said to me and the fact that she was ready to leave the country to live somewhere else with me. 

But she started to date the sexfriend she had a couple of years back. She didn't told me that, so I learnt it  while i was doing my big declaration time full of emotions.

Anyways, I tried to understand where I messed up with her, we talked about it and she did the usual :""It's not you, it's me"" type of speech but I just can't believe it, it never worked with any girl I liked, it can't always be them. My friends are saying that i'm not the problem too but I can't trust them, they'r just seeing a friend who is sad and they don't want to burry him more by saying that he is a piece of shit.

Feeling like I’m worthless and I wish I was dead and I try to imagine the easiest way to kill myself but I don’t want to disturb anyone with finding my body. I also get a strong craving to be shot in the head. I wish I knew how to make that feeling stop. But it kind of subsides after a bit and I can ignore it at least. Maybe I need to start medication. The worst part is I tell myself not to bother anyone about it, so I just go silent. But it’s not anyone’s fault, I’m not mad at anyone.

I recommend creating an online dating profile exactly for this. Just post the age range you're looking for and say that you've always liked older women. There's going to be cougars who are looking for younger men.

"I (M25) had a girlfriend for 2 years, let's name her K (F27).

K and I had a toxic/difficult relationship despite showing how well we are in social media. For 2 years, I helped K in finding a job, helping her financially, while being the breadwinner and trying to save money for myself.

K left her family 3 years ago, and we took her in and from there I had the ""responsibility"" to take care of her. Despite my work-from-home setup, she's been very jealous for some reason. She gets mad when there's a female on my team during online games. She's very suspicious that I am talking to other women, and even accused me of having s\*x with one of my friends. Basically, she's kind of delusional and crazy in some way. I am working 2 jobs, 2 of which I asked the companies to make K join without any experience, but they only accepted her because I am good at my job.

So, basically, I worked 2 jobs, while teaching K what to do, while being the breadwinner, while taking K's work when she feels overwhelmed. I got burnt out. All of the toxicity we had in our relationship, plus the ""responsibility"" I have for K. I've fallen out of love. I just stayed because she doesn't have anyone to help her, though I really tried to have my feelings back towards her.

A year into our relationship, I fell in love with my ex again. She was my first love. We had no communication, but for more than a year I've been dreaming of her and in that 1 year, I thought I was going to forget her but no. It only made me miss her. AGAIN, we didn't have any communication. I decided that I really want to get out of the responsibility that I have with K, and pursue my ex. I've been brutally honest when I broke up with K, that I will pursue my ex, and I no longer love her. She accepted it, because she knew how miserable I became.

Now, I talked about it to my friends, and they hated me for my decision. Was I wrong? I was honest about how I felt and what I'm going to do. K and I also broke up on good terms.

It just hurts me that my friends of many years hated me without knowing the amount of stress and responsibility I had with K, which made me fall out of love. I'm just 25, I want to put my happiness first rather than being miserable."	fanalis01141	post	20.92271474755718	male	White	0.994053304195404	na	na	na	2	offmychest	no prediction.

"I grew up in a very traditional household, men work and women serve. My childhood had its ups and downs but I have always been treated like an adult. I am the oldest of 6 and my parents treat us girls almost like maids. Everything has always been on me and my brother got all of the credit. When I was in college my parents “supported” me (we have always had a VERY complicated relationship) until Covid when my brother started using drugs. I went through hell and back to try and help by jeopardized my safety, relationships and my future and then he died last year and it was my fault. I had a talk with him leading up to his death while he was clean, he was trying to make amends and was finally clean for months and trying to get his life back together. 
 I was home to visit my family and said some horrible things to him. To paraphrase, I told him if he was going to put us through his addiction again he might as well kill himself because we would probably be better off without him and his shit, and then he did. He purposely overdosed a few days after our talk and I’ve been living with the guilt ever since. I haven’t been able to bring myself to tell anyone and have distanced myself from my entire family because every time I look at them, Im reminded of what I did. If I never told him that, he’d probably be with us here today- clean and living. 
He shared some deep things with me that I’m still not ready to talk about but everything he said that day made me so angry and I wasn’t ready to forgive him so I lashed out. Ever since he died my life has gone downhill and I feel like the universe is punishing me but I deserve it. I’ve been in therapy for months and it’s been helping but I still can’t admit this to anyone in my life. I’m trying to get better and make amends but part of me realizes I deserve this, karma is a very real thing. I’ll never forgive myself but it’s something I’m trying to learn to live with."

"For context I'm 23, live with my parents, and don't pay rent. I have a lot to be greatful for.

My mom makes me feel like the worst person. She called me a bad daughter 3 mins into a phone call. I asked her what did I say in 3 mins to become a bad daughter and she wouldn't even tell me! Then we talked again later and I was just trying to be agreeable and not say much and then she got upset that I wasn't saying anything and said that it was bad that I didn't want to talk to my own mother.

My mom has this thing where she wants the best for me and my siblings but her delivery just makes it sound like constant criticism in evert area. I've tried to talk to her to let her know ""hey I know your trying to be helpful but it hurts my feelings when you do/say x"" her response everything is that if I know she doesn't mean it like that then I shouldn't take it like that and to stop being sensitive.

She criticizes everything about me. She always tells me my stomach is getting big and I need to eat less, then im eating too little. She always judges what I eat. It's gotten so bad that I just eat in the car or before  get home so I don't have to hear about it. She says I should wear more dresses and look more like a girl. I do that and she ask why I only wear dresses and that I need to stop wearing make up so much. She tells me to make new friends, then hates the ones I make. She compares me to my friends that are doing well and say I need to be more like them. She criticizes my major (business), what I say, what I don't say, and somehow im always selfish. I had someone that I really loved passed away very suddenly and I was devastated. It was only the day after I was crying and she told me that I needed to get over it. I cried alone for months

It's just really hard because it always seems like I'm doing the wrong thing and even when I try to do the ""right"" thing it's still somehow wrong. And I live with her so it's like I can never escape. She always says I make bad decisions and that I don't think. Whatever I decide to do there's always something wrong with my decision that she points out. It's so bad that I'm always second guessing myself and I have a hard time making decisions.

I love my mom so much I really do. She just makes me feel insecure, and stupid, like I can't do anything right and like I'm a bad person. 

Nothing will change, it's been like this for years, the only thing I can do is move out but I  don't make enough money to move out and pay for school at the same time.

I'm sorry you have to deal with such a negative situation at home. Once you get finished with your degree you'll be able to move out and not have to put up with her negative attitude all the time. Once you move out set boundaries. The first time she says something negative to you and a phone call tell her it's a warning, if she does it again tell her you're going to hang up if she says something negative about you, the time she does it a third time hang up. Do not call or answer your phone for a day or two. She's saying you're being a bad daughter, because you're not doing everything she wants you to do even though she keeps changing her mind. She's setting unobtainable goals. Don't fall for it don't think you're doing anything wrong. Get your degree, get a job, move out, set clear boundaries, and then reinforce those boundaries with actions. Your mom will be upset at first but eventually your relationship should get better, or if it doesn't, you'll have to cut her negativity out of your life, or it will affect you for the rest of your life.

I don’t know what goes on in your life and I don’t want to make anything more difficult than it is but I would like to share my experience if that’s ok. I lost my dad to s****de when I was young and ever since I always questioned why he did it if he loved us. It’s a very selfish thought but I will always wonder why he didn’t say anything to us and while I get what you’re saying, I’m afraid that your wife may always have the same thought. I apologise if it makes things worse for you and I will delete my comment if you want but I can guarantee you that for your wife, the world is so much better with you in it even if you’re unwell. Much love!	VegetableNo2048	reply	na	na	na	0.0041725123301148415	strong	no	no	na	offmychest	failed
"Mate, your wife does not deserve a load of love being piled onto her just for you to desert her in this world. That is selfish. No matter how bad it gets if you have people who love and rely on you, you cannot be so selfish and proceed to take your life away.

"Hey
Im really proud of you for your efforts towards your wife. Im sure she’s really appreciative too. Im so sorry things are really hard on you. I have depression as well and I dont wanna pretend I understand your situation or know what youve been through, but I do understand what its like to feel so much pain that you plan to die. I dont know you, but I just wanna tell you that if you do go through with it, the world would have lost what seems to be a beautiful and loving soul. Know that you’re not alone in whatever youre going through. The struggles might not go away, but the pain is alleviated when shared with others. Im here for you if you ever wanna open up.

Please call or text 988, as many times as necessary! Every person I’ve ever known who has lost a loved one that way had their life dramatically changed (not for the better), and sometimes the loss spans generations. I’m so sorry you’re feeling hopeless - please fight for hope. I hate to say it, but if you’re gone, your wife will remember that extra affection with sadness - because she’ll know you did it with that plan in mind. I pray that one day you’ll think back to today as a turning point.

Hey man, I hope this comment finds you in slightly better state of mind. I've been there. Multiple times. I've held multiple guns to my head over the years. Had a stay in a mental hospital for kids/teens when I was 19. I know the feeling well. Many things have helped. I'd like to share them and maybe you'll find you're own version of my examples. It sounds awful to say that people you love won't keep you alive. But I promise I understand and I have zero judgement. Sometimes realizing that if I ended it all, I'd never experience that moment when you find a new song out of the blue and play it on repeat all day long because it hits all the dopamine lol. Or that I'd never experience another amazing story again (movies/anime/video games etc). Some moments were wondering how my mom would live out the rest of her life without me. How would my dog and cat be without me? There's a lot and I probably wouldn't be able to share it all here. But when you're in this state it's really just you and the mirror. And people always say it's selfish and maybe that's what you need is a little selfishness. But not in this manner. Even in a hopeless manner as this, finding the smallest of stupid reasons to make you be selfish in a better/healthier way basically has helped me get through in a lot of these moments. There's a lot of space you take up in people's lives that really enjoy that you hold it. Think of all the potential you hold to affect someone today/tomorrow/decades from now positively. Now reverse it. Think of all the small things you could experience that make your day a little brighter over the years. I wish I could give you and hug brother. Just know there's people who care.

"Everytime she raises her hand at me, I flinch, my heart beat increases, and I suddenly want to cry. It might seem extremely dramatic to some but I'm not kidding, I am genuinely afraid of her, my hands are literally trembling as I write this. My mother has abused me for my whole life for stupid and irrelevant things like grades or my ""attitude"". The beating were bad to the point that my grandmother had to push my mother away from me and hit her multiple times for her to stop. She was always protesting that I was the one horrible to her, and that I deserved it but my grandma quickly shut her up, unfortunately my grandma isn't alive anymore, the only person who made me feel safe in this household, I have absolutely none to protect me now. She was like a mother to me, she took care of me while my mother was at work, now she's gone, and I'm devastated and terrified.

This morning my mother went to hug me in my bed, she tackled me like she used to when she beat me, I got flashbacks, I remember pushing her off me sobbing and running into another room crying because I was so scared. I don't like over exaggerating things, I was quite literally shaking. I'm deeply traumatized by my mother and I can't seem to forgive her. The last time we had a fight was days before my grandmother died, once again she pushed my mother and I off eachother and she lectured us both, days after she died of a stroke. I still wonder if it's my fault she's dead.

I feel like a horrible person not being able to forgive her even after her mother died. Maybe I am selfish and a horrible person, I've said bad things to her in arguments like I've done today. She's tried to guilt trip me but I ignored her, she threatened to off herself and I'm scared she'll do it and my whole family will hate me even more. I'm afraid of her. I've spent my entire childhood under covers of my bed afraid she'd strangle me in her sleep. I am only 14 years old. There is nothing I can do.

My dad is the kind of father that no matter what you do, if you don't act like a slave in the family then you aren't doing enough. If you don't have straight a's then you aren't doing enough. If he sees a single dish in the sink then you arent doing enough. If you have a panic attack then he feels bad but proceeds to turn around and do it all over again. I flunked 2 semesters in (community) college because I was so scared of disappointing him that I started to have panic attacks and physically couldn't go into the class. I will never be good enough for him and I do not have the resources to leave home. I just left a job because of my boss attempting to screw me out of my paycheck, and am currently in the setup stages of a new job. But to him, I'm unemployed and do nothing all day long. If the grass isn't cut or some other small thing that is not as big a deal as he makes it out to be isn't done, then he gets pissy. No matter what I take on or do, it will never be enough because I can't do it all. Sometimes I wonder how much better off he would have been if I hadn't been conceived. My parents only got married because mom was pregnant. If I never were to have existed, then maybe he would be a happier man.	throwaway120997	post	14.674066595582111	female	White	0.9986807703971863	na	na	na	4	offmychest	no prediction.

"I'm actually a black American. But my country playlist in a strange way represents in a way my knowledge of history, like knowing and having classics is a badge of knowledge in some ways here, the songs are often very illustrative of social (although white) and consequentially economic constructs as they existed and worked at the time. And of course there is a heavy drinking theme to many songs but not just that but kind the raw THOUGHTS of a drunk person. Often when you drink you might feel a sense of clarity on certain situations or wonder why you're on the fence on it, or feel your emotional inhibitions are gone, and you realize how much you love someone, or how much you hate someone, or how hopefully or completely hopeless a situation is when your sober self won't admit it. Country especially classic tends to really go into these feelings. Not always inebriation required but just talking about raw feelings and hurtful situations etc. It's also been at least in my experience very conductive to meetings with potential partners when hanging out in privacy but maybe that's just a result of who I tend to date. I guess people don't expect me as a black guy to have a 8+ hour long country playlist but I just love the southern life and it feels like pieces of history I am becoming knowledgeable to. 

Classic country sometimes feels like more than music to me because I don't feel the same about other classic genres I guess I just feel because a lot of the lyrics it's a very interesting insight into the types of history and constructs I mentioned earlier. And living in the south you hear the music a lot.....you don't tend to hear classics played of other genres at current events. Maybe from 10 years ago or so but not regularly of 30/40+ years prior release, that's also why I feel like knowledge of them is like a social currency in a way in certain circles here who enjoy the music.

Here's the proper amount:

50 Fl oz. of water is way too high, lower the amount. It could cause problems.

36 Fl oz of water if you're working out and working up a sweat.

24 Fl oz of water is the standardized norm for the Human demand in a 24 hour period.

16.9 Fl oz. of water is still considered fine within a 24 hour period.

10 Fl oz. is insufficient amount of fluids your body requires to keep blood pressure at normal levels.

6 Fl oz. is very low amounts of water, insufficient for keeping the brain and other organs healthy.

"As hard as it is you need to tell your mother your not equipped to help her. 

At your age and place in life you gave her a rational solution (counseling) she is in a place where rational solutions are not options that she is willing to do.

agree where you can. at no point give her advice (one you're not married so knowledge of a full marriage is not in your wheel house. and two if she does take advice from you no matter how bad/good if it fails she can blame you and not take responsibility for the outcome)"	PrintMedium2138	reply	na	na	na	0.9994931221008301	weak	no	no	na	offmychest	failed

"My best friend (A) for 10 years slept with a man (B) who's about to be married. They appeared to be coworkers. What makes it bad is this man is currently in a long term long distance relationship, and it's worse, he's engaged. His victim (C) doesn't know that he's cheating.  
One time A asked me to accompany her clubbing on her dime because she's lonely and I came along broke. What she didn't tell me was that B also came along and she ordered me to basically asked him if He loves A. It's some fucking dumb scenario where she arranged herself to go to the toilet and i had to go ask him "" Hey A has suffered a lot ,do you love her for real?""   
I did ask him because I was broke as fuck and I felt guilty because she ordered me expensive drinks. I regret this decision and i would like to snitch on them. I hate that I have to be involved in this , I do not support this at all.  
I have seen C's instagram pictures and seeing her smiling and posing with the ring in front of the camera hurts me. I know A will hate me forever if I snitched because :  
1. I know she will lose her job because she's fucking B

Your only responsibility is to your friend and telling her that you’re disappointed in her actions and thought she was better than that.

"First, what is your motivation for snitching? Do you want to expose her because you care about the truth and justice, or because you want to hurt her back? If it’s the latter, then you might end up feeling worse than before. Revenge is not a healthy way to cope with betrayal. It might give you a temporary sense of satisfaction, but it won’t heal your wounds or restore your trust. It might also damage your reputation and relationships with other people.

Second, what are the consequences of snitching? How will it affect your friendship with A, your work environment, and your social circle? Are you prepared to deal with the backlash and drama that might follow? How will it affect the victim C, who might be devastated by the news? Are you sure that snitching is the best way to help her, or would it be better to let her find out on her own terms? Snitching might seem like the right thing to do, but it might also cause more harm than good.

Third, what are the alternatives to snitching? Is there a way that you can confront A and B directly and express your feelings and concerns? Can you talk to someone else who knows about the situation and get their advice? Can you distance yourself from A and B and focus on your own life and happiness? Snitching is not the only option you have.

"If someone drunk passed out on me and also drunkenly claimed that they ""wouldn't mind dating me"" then I'd also probably expect that in the morning, they would probably give me the cold shoulder, ignore me, pretend they don't remember what they said/did, and that they would send me a bunch of mixed messages once they sobered up.

exactly what I meant about expecting to being manipulated. I would expect you to think ""I told you how I feel when I was drunk (which totally doesn't count as being sincere) and now it's your turn to be vulnerable when you're sober because then I hold all the power and can reject you by pretending it didn't happen.""

I (25F) feel like I'm living in this weird state of limbo. A new day comes and goes and nothing is different. I have lots of hobbies: video games, crochet, music, but none of them give me any joy anymore. Some info about me, I've had depression since I was 15 and been on anti depressants for a majority of the time since then. Tried lots of different things and am now currently on 150 mg of venlafaxine, but have a few side effects that I hate. Excessive sweating, like drenched even in the coldest winter and I am unable to orgasm. I've been married for just over a year now and no matter what me or my husband do I just cannot get there. We've tried everything at this point, different positions, different ways to have sex, toys, even when I'm by myself I can't and I end up just feeling sore from pushing myself. Life is so hard right now. We don't even pay full rent since we live in a relatives unit (the size of a shoebox) and we still have trouble paying the bills. All my savings are gone, over $10,000 and it's getting to the point where we barely have enough money to eat. We are cleaners so don't make a lot of money at all. We're unable to build up any savings and can't buy ourselves/each other nice things. We have a dog which is the only thing getting us by I think, without him we would be utterly miserable. I've been thinking of coming off of the anti depressant but everything I've read online about coming off and withdrawal is really grim. They say go to your Dr or a psychiatrist but we just don't have the money for that. Where I live medical professionals are expensive as hell, and I'd much rather put the money towards bills than medical stuff. I want to have a baby so bad. Not just the baby, I want to have a child, I want to love and care for it and give it the best possible life. I want to see it grow up and discover who they are. But everytime I think about it I just know that that's never going to be possible. We have no money, no proper housing or space and everyone around me just says that I'll never be healthy enough to have one, due to my mental health and physical as I also have a chronic illness (fibromyalga). At this point I don't even feel like I'm living anymore, just scraping by to the next day. I love my husband so much and he has been a real heaven send and a rock I can lean on but even he has been struggling. He suffers from ADHD and depression himself but isn't on any medication, as, again, medical professionals are so expensive and just getting a diagnosis can be upwards of $800 let alone medication. All I want to do is curl up into a ball, fall asleep and never wake up. I love my family so much so I could never commit suicide because I don't want to do that to them. I'm just so sick of existing. If you've got anything from this its be greatful for what you have and who you have in your life. Don't take what you have for granted. Your dinner tonight, your bills that can be paid without thinking twice, your health either physical or mental. Anyway, I hate myself and I hate my life.

" I (33F) am a mom to 4 (15F,12F,10F & 7F) 
I’m married to their dad (33m)
My bio dad walked out the door before I was even born and declared he didn’t want to know.
I have an amazing step dad who came into my life age 6 and he really has always treated me like his own, although I did sometimes look in on him, my mom and my brother and think they were the real deal as a family unit and this wasn’t because of anything at home it was more because if I ever referred to him as my dad I’d be corrected “step dad” by adults, friends anyone but he’s my only dad I’ve ever known
When I see the love my husband and myself have for my daughters I wonder how? How did he walk away? How can he actually not care?  Am I a bad person?
 my own flesh and blood didn’t want to know 
I’ve never had anything to do with his family either so I don’t know a whole half of myself and that bothers me. 
(my mom and him weren’t in a serious long term relationship) 
my mom was always honest with me and I’ve always known if I wanted to reach out she would support me, (which I did and that was an absolute disaster but a whole long story itself) she always told me the truth about him not wanting to know, the door was always open to him to reach out to her to see me he genuinely didn’t want to.  
Anyway as I sit looking at husband and my girls watching a movie all happy, little one snuggled into his side totally at peace I can’t help but feel a little sad I didn’t experience that which I know is selfish, I’m so proud they got that amazing dad they deserve the world. 
Should I be over it by now, I’m a grown adult a mom myself but inside I still feel like a young child needing love and I know that sounds pathetic.   
But who am I? Why is it ok that men or women can walk out of their child’s lives and having people questioning who they are."	PresenceLazy7915	post	23.887356709405594	female	White	0.004205204080790281	na	na	na	4	offmychest	no prediction.
"Honestly, I don’t think that’s something you ever get over, no matter how old you get or how many children of your own you have. And it’s not selfish at all to feel sad because you didn’t have that. It’s not pathetic to feel that way, it’s 100% normal. Like you said, you’ll never know about that side of your family and that side of your own identity, and while you may get used to it, I would imagine the longing to know doesn’t ever fully go away. Why would it? 

Just know that your dad didn’t walk away because of you or because you were bad. (how could you be bad when you weren’t even born yet?) He walked away because he was selfish and irresponsible and that is not your fault. Some people just do horrible, incomprehensible things with no regard for the way their actions affect other people. I’m so sorry your father way one of them. It’s his loss all they way. 

People who don’t want to be parents usually don’t make good parents, so, perhaps it’s a blessing in disguise that you were spared the bad father he would have been? (Sorry, I always try to look for a silver linings.) Even without him, it sounds like you were very loved by your mom and your stepdad and now you have built a life filled with the love of your husband and children. That’s huge, some people are never able to do that. I know that doesn’t make up for not having a dad, but I do hope it brings you comfort and happiness. Again, I’m so sorry your dad sucks."

I was at my hen do in 2016 and I was sat opposite my mom and her face was pure shock and she said “your bio dad is there” he recognised her of course and said “wow you’re a mother of the bride” yes it’s your daughter that’s getting married.. he then proceeded to buy a bottle of wine, plonk it on the table, put his arm around me and say “every girl deserves her dad to be at her wedding”. I replied my dad will be at my wedding (step dad)and is giving me away” he said but could I please come then him and mom had a bit of an argument and he was kicked out by security bloody wild!  Absolutely wild I have extreme anxiety so this is why security kicked him, he said he will find out and come and just watch thankfully he didn’t as I don’t think my moms brothers would of taken to kindly to that!

"I’m so sorry you’re feeling this way. I promise you things can get better if you don’t give up. Is there any way you could find a new living situation? Maybe find someone who is renting out a room or looking to share an apartment or something like that? Getting away from toxic parents can do wonders for your mental health. 

Also, do yourself a favor and be done with the married guy. Free up your emotional energy. It’s not worth the roller coaster of emotions. He’s not going to leave his wife, they rarely ever do. And even if he did, would you really want to start a life with someone who cheats and could pull the rug right out from under you at any time like he did to his wife? If you want stability and happiness in life, this is not your guy. If you want someone to love you and commit to you, this is not your guy. You’re happy ending is not going to be built on the back of another women’s broken home. I can promise you that. In order to find the right guy, you first need to give up the wrong guy. Don’t get sucked in to the sunken cost fallacy. 

I’m sure sure it any of these things would be possible for you but…. Have you considered sprucing up your resume and sending it out to other employers? Depending on your field, it could be a great time to get a new job. A lot of places are paying more than they did even a year or two ago to try to fill positions. Perhaps consider a career change if you don’t enjoy your job or consider going back to school to study something else? Maybe you could look into student loans, scholarships, grants. Take night classes while you work. 

Anyway, I hope things get better for you. You’re still so young and have so much to look forward to if you choose to stick around."	hotchocolate13	reply	na	na	na	0.999432384967804	strong	no	strong	na	offmychest	no prediction.
"I (26) want to divorce my (m27) husband because he drinks too much.

(I'm sorry if there is any grammar/vocabulary mistakes, english is not my primary language)

For context, we met 4 years ago when i started university,he was working full time because he's a school drop out. 

He was already an heavy drinker, but at the time i didn't mind it i was much younger and it wasn't my primary concern.

But through the years it started bothering me because i started to realize a few thing s during therapy. First of all my mother was and alcoholic who'd molested me as a kid (she still is). And i talked to him about it and telling him that i wanted him to quit drinking. 

Secondly, it's really affecting our finances. I recently had my degree and starting to work full time and we still can't make ends meet. (I'm debt Free and our appartment doesn't cost that much)

I've already asked him to quit a few times but he always find excuses. Like : 《i don't want to quit abruptly because my body is so used to it and it may affect me》
(he's been drinking like that since he turned 18), 
《i'm drinking less now, i'll take more time to finish my drink so i cant cut numbers 》etc...

He's not violent or anything he just drinks too much. We have to buy 3 bottle of 1.15l(40$/bottle) of vodka per week. And he always want me to take shots with him even on a monday. This is not what i want. And i feel bad for not trying to help him more.

I am a 26yo male and I have recently accepted that I have no real friends. It wasn’t a sudden epiphany but I have finally stopped living in denial after all the signs I’ve seen over the years. I’ve always tried to be a good friend to those around me but I don’t see it reciprocated. I can think of many examples where I expected a different outcome from my so-called friends and they showed me their true colors. The two that really stick out are the death of my father and my grandmother. In a span of 3 years, I lost two of the most important people to me and you would think that there would be some kind of support or encouragement from the people I’ve known for 10+ years, but only 1 out of my 4 “best friends” even acknowledged what happened even though they all knew. I get men aren’t good at expressing emotions, but when it comes to death, it should be common courtesy to check on your friend’s mental well-being. But me being the pushover I am, I let the grudge go and continued to hang with these people from time to time. The thing is as time goes on and I get older, I truly have begun to realize that I am basically doing life alone. I do have a wonderful gf, but it’s different when a man has a good group of like-minded men around them. I see other groups of friends that are extremely close and loyal to each other, and I feel envious honestly. My “friends” are more like acquaintances with common interests that bring us together. Weed, sports, & video games are the only time we actually hang out. And I have outgrown a lot of those things. But in terms of genuine friendship, no one ever checks in to see how I’m doing. No one cares about me. If I were to stop initiating contact, it would probably be months before I heard from someone. And odds are it would be for a favor. It’s so confusing to me because (not to toot my own horn) I am a pretty sociable, decently attractive, charismatic person. But I have problems making new friends because it feels so fake and forced sometimes. So I stay loyal to the people that are in my comfort zone even though they treat me poorly… I guess I would prefer pseudo-friendship over loneliness at this point. But it does seem similar. I don’t know what purpose of this post is. I guess I’m just venting but some advice would be nice. Thank you for reading.

"hello sir. I'm sorry your realizing your true friends.

I noticed the common interests you have had with them are all very youthful hobbies/interests.

I am not a male. I have a SO who struggles with making friends. however SO has been able to make some extremely good and loyal friends through his hobbies and interests. 

SO's parents weren't really ""fix it"" people. As and adult SO became very interested in getting/maintaining a vehicle. That has forced him to seek out other with better knowledge and very often SO will either have 1-3 other men over helping on a project or be asked to come help. 

As Adults men's seem to make friends in and around their daily life commitments. (cars/construction/landscaping/camping/hiking/fishing/fitness) possibly even join a basketball team at the YMCA

"This has been occupying my mind the past few months.

For some context, I have never ever felt attraction or love towards anyone in my whole life. I don't know why, I feel pretty odd about it, seeing all people my age having crushes, getting into relationships... 

It doesn't bother me though, I can't control it. So I've just assumed I was mostly an asexual girl. 

However, this year in my class in college, I have seen a girl that caught my attention so much for some reason, ever since the first time I saw her I couldn't stop thinking about her.

She's extremely beautiful but in a very different way than anyone I've ever seen. The most angelic smile I've ever seen, (I would say that some may find her basic, but not to me at all.) She's the smartest student in the class, although she doesn't participate but you can just feel that vibe from her, she's the type of student to answer a question that nobody could answer. She dresses in her own way, weirdly most of the time, but she stands out, everything she wears fits her, I love her ""weird"" style, I love everything about her. 

Throughout the semester I found myself always looking at her, and at first, she started noticing and glancing back at me. Even when she started to look back at me, I never broke eye contact, I wanted her to see that I admire her. 

This may sound creepy, but I always sat a little behind her in the class, and everytime she turned back, she always finds me looking at her. 

Once, during a really boring class, I didn't sit in my usual place, maybe sat a little further, and this time when she turned back (to stretch?), she looked at the area where I usually sat and she didn't find me in my usual place so she started looking behind further (I assumed she was looking to find me?), until our eyes met, and I smiled to myself. It was so damn cute, I couldn't help but smile a little to myself. I hope it was real, I hope she looked behind actually to see me too.

I saw her with a girl lately in the semester, I believe it's her girlfriend. But we still make eye contact a lot, although she shys away when it lingers.

I've never ever talked to her. I've only talked to one of her friends, during projects and about studying and stuff when we got into groups.

I would say I'm a stoic person? I'm not moved by emotions or anything like that, but I feel a lot towards her. Not sexual desire. But something much deeper than love, I feel peace just looking at her. Like when I look at her I just know that everything will be okay. And just the thoughts about her makes me smile.

I've never ever felt like this. I don't know why I feel like this towards her. Please help me, what could this be? What could she feel towards me? And does this mean I'm a lesbian?

Reading this felt like I wrote it. I was in the exact same situation when I was 13 realising my sexuality by having a crush on a similar girl that you described and in a non English school. She would stare at me too, we sat together for a year and I'd often see her staring at me but was too shy to stare back and the one time I looked back at her she held the gaze and smiled at me. It wasn't sexual, it wasn't love since I didn't know her well enough and it wasn't a crush because everything she did reassured me and made me happy. That was I was thinking, looking back it was in-between love and a crush. Since it was my first crush on a girl and I was young it was more prominent and powerful, young love is very confusing but a once in a lifetime experience cherish it. this is my experience maybe it's yours too? take it with a grane of salt since I don't know exacly how you feel but this is my best guess.

"First of all thank you for your answer! I feel like you would understand me since you said you loved a girl who's similar to the one I described. They have an unusual charm, don't they? Haha. The part when you said she smiled at you...this really hit home.

I wanted to ask you, do you still think about her? do you find that your experience with this girl defined your sexuality? Like did you realize you were a lesbian after what you felt for her? Because I feel like the thing I felt for that girl, I could never feel for any other girl, she's really that special to me even thought I've never spoken to her. I saw something rare in her from the first time.

After analyzing my feelings, I came up with a few possible scenarios: I felt close to her because I somehow see myself in her, I thought she's my soulmate (nothing to do with love relationships, but an actual SOULmate, my half in another dimension ahaha,) I felt like she's a different version of me, the other ""me"" if my life had turned out differently... because I sensed that we have so many things in common. Even in terms of appearance, we share some similarities (hair color, skin color, eye shape)

I hope this makes sense...lol.

And well, would this still be considered ""young love"" if I'm in my very early-twenties? Hahaha.

I love when we would have an eye contact in the college halls, other times when she turns back and realize I'm looking at her and she looks away shyly. I can't forget those moments. 

I don't know what she felt for me, maybe she thought I was a creep for staring at her for long, who knows lol."	Automatic_Custard_37	follow-up	na	na	na	0.001397454645484686	weak	no	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.

"I recently moved from Edmonton Canada to start a new job at a major oil company in New Jersey, USA. Sold our home, wife resigned from her job, and relocated to NJ with our two kids (10 and 8). Unfortunately, things haven’t turned out well like we thought. The schools we found for our boys aren’t that great and I don’t seem to enjoy the new place and really miss our lives back in Edmonton. We are thinking of transitioning back to Canada but want to do it in a way not to put too much financial stress on ourselves. My wife and kids can move back immediately before the school year starts but we’ll have to pay double rents, etc. I’m hoping to push my company to make me work from Canada or start looking for other opportunities back in Edmonton if that doesn’t work out.

I really need some advice, especially for those who have been in similar situations. Thank you!

"I'm kinda scared/anxious about taking the exam on Sunday. I've known friends who barely reviewed and passed the exam, but I don't think I'm like them at all.

I haven't reviewed the past few weeks because of work, and now I'm scared that I don't have time to adequately study.

Kabado lang ako na baka may implication na I'm really not as smart as I think I am, and deep down bobo talaga ako. Ang bobo ko pa naman sa Math and Filipino. I also peeked a bit sa reviewer and Im starring to think na pati sa English magdududa na rin ako.

"It really depends on the exam.  If you do not have a job yet and you're taking the exam to get on the list of potential candidates then if you fail, you will just be at the very bottom of the list and you're unlikely to get notifications that a job opening is available to apply.  So there isn't any risk beyond losing out on the test fee.

If you have a job and you need to pass the test to keep the job, then you gotta find out the passing score and just score that or higher to keep your job.  This is usually called a provisional position, which means you have the job and keep it if you pass the exam.  Some jobs are nice and will let you keep the job and test again the next time the exam rolls around, but some employers will boot you right out.  For example, I have a job, I had to take a civil service exam, the passing grade is 70. I only have to score 70+ to keep my job, it doesn't matter if there are people who scored more than me, I already have the job, its cheaper to keep me because I already have the training.

If its a basic entry level exam you really have nothing to worry about, its mostly reading comprehension, management questions, team building question, ethics morals, and some basic job related questions.  Usually designed to allow even the average joe to take and potentially pass.

If its a promotional exam it will be more in depth and this is the one you need to study.

Just know even if you score a 100 there's no guarantee you get a job, because most places like to hire internally before they refer to the list and contacting people and letting them know an opening is available and they are free to apply.  


My tip for you is to see if there is a book related to this test in the library. It will not have the exact questions and will likely have VERY out of date info and questions from past exams, but it will give you a general idea of the layout and the sort of language the test will provide.  


Take your time when taking the exam, bring extra pencils, bring a drink and quiet snack,  take breaks while doing the exam."	TengenaDesu	reply	na	na	na	0.9957690238952637	no	no	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.
"Title says it all. Ever since I was young I’ve always had a preoccupation with fat guys, I always preferred fat characters in media, etc. Now I’m 26 years old and it’s all I think about. When I’m not working and being a normal person I am masturbating to pictures and videos of fat guys doing things. I fantasize constantly about running my hands across their beautiful, supple bodies, pressing my face into their fat crotches, kissing them, feeling their bellies slap my back as they fuck me from behind. It’s all I think about.

A few weeks ago I was at the gas station and I saw this giant man sitting behind the counter. He was so beautiful. I asked him for a vape cartridge and as he went to get it he dropped it on the ground. As he bent over to grab it, his whole body jiggled. I tried to avert my eyes so he wouldn’t be embarrassed but I had a hard time not staring in awe. I told my friend about this encounter and as I was telling her about it she pointed out that my nipples were getting hard. My nipples are probably getting hard right now too. I go back to that gas station every once in a while but I haven’t seen him since. I think about him a lot.

So I’ve grown up in a very abusive, ver negligent, horrific household. Because of that I’ve never had a gf or many friends really. Thus, I am a virgin at 18 years old. It has destroyed my self esteem and killed my confidence. Now I can’t even hold convos with women or ask one out because I’m the back of my mind there’s always the thinking “maybe this is the one?” Which probably rubs off and turns many away. Because of this I am extremely depressed and lonely, at a time where I’m at college and should be meeting my one. Now I don’t think there is a one for me, and that I’m perpetually single. Thus, I’m thinking about hiring an escort to just take the biggest point of shame for me. I don’t know anymore. I just don’t wanna be alone.

"Being alone is okay. You’re so young, most people don’t lose their virginity until 19 (on average) and a lot of people don’t lose it until 20 or 30. You’re okay and normal. 

Take care of yourself mentally, physically and emotionally. Don’t expect love from a person you’ve just met. Don’t expect love or sex from anyone. 

It will happen, and sex is very much overrated. Talk to people and be platonic, keep your heart safe. Make friends with any kind of person. Build your confidence and you will attract who you want.

I can’t guarantee it no. But I think it’s unlikely you’ll die alone and extremely unlikely you’ll die a virgin. If you’re truly okay with getting a prostitute to have your first time then I’d suggest you get an escort, someone you can have a conversation with (like the other comment said).

"Lots of us have been where you’re at. Fear, lack of confidence, self hate to some extent, constant self-reinforcing negative thoughts, and of course, being an unloved untouched deprived sex starved virgin. I was all those and more until 24 and it was awful. It was extremely pervasively awful. What you’re probably missing from the messages of hope from us who were there, is just a few years, because vast changes are going to happen to you. A catalyst for me was after I got a long ride from a guy, he let me stay the night in his place and all night long he and his gf screamed and gasped and groaned and rocked that bed like a jack hammer. It was my worst night ever. The next day I’d crossed some threshold and I could no longer stand being so lonely. I went up to a woman in a cafe and talked to her. Not much came of it except my soul didn’t implode. So I did it again. I was scared as hell but desperation pushed me. Within a week I’d gotten laid. I hope you don’t need to be wrecked to the level of desperation I needed. But if that’s what it takes. It was worth it. It was SO worth it.

I don’t know why some of us are so bad early on at connecting with others. What the hell good is it to be so infinitely shy? And I can’t say for 100% sure you’ll succeed by the time your 24 or whatever. But the odds are hugely in your favor that you will. Because you can’t be more of a loser than I was, and I made it.

"Thanks for asking. I’ll speak to the events, but maybe more important is what’s loosely known as attitude, but there’s a more philosophically rigorous  reason. It’s related to, if you get a new car (new for you) you’ll probably see a lot more of that same year and model on the road. Why? There are common cognitive biases that are working, including confirmation bias and recency bias. Your brain is altered such that it’s focused on the big thing you just did (buy a car). I was aimed from that torturous night at losing my virginity and there was almost nothing else on my mind. That’s the context. From there, wherever I went I was not only 100% looking for every opportunity, but also appearing to everyone looking at me that I was doing that. This might be cringe creepy in the extreme but it wasn’t, because I hadn’t become an evil person looking to damage anyone, I was the same old hyper shy introvert as always, except just very different in being fixated on my goal. It’s difficult to put this to words: the basically same person was behaving very differently. Maybe like you’re looking for something important you lost. Every mental process is focused on where it might be, when did I last have it, etc.

In my particular case I visited a male friend who lived in a group home, there was a female housemate there, and partly because of my state of mind I thought she was the most beautiful person in the world. I didn’t say that, I just thought it, and I’m sure it showed. I think I said something safe like, would you like to walk to (an easy destination). She said yes. Sometime later I said I’d like to be with you. I *never* would have asked that before my horrible night. She said ok. I was definitely nothing special, no job no money no prospects, drifting. But she knew I wanted her more than a billion dollars.

For the record my first sexy time was pathetic. I lied that I’d slept with other people (she totally knew it was a lie), and without going into NSFW detail, I was a truly terrible lover, incompetent and incoherent. It didn’t matter! She was patient and she knew I was attracted to her like my life depended on it, and so she let me try again in a few days after my humiliation had eased a little. 

Over the years, I’ve gotten clear that it wasn’t just good luck. The intense focus like I had then does cause life to proceed differently.

There’s no f’n way I would have had a clue about what I’m talking about now, when I was 18. If you followed the train of thought, you’re a sophisticated person. If I can clarify anything please respond here or by dm and I’ll do my best to be honest and helpful. I want you to experience the beauty of sex, and I believe you will, sooner rather than later. Maybe you’ll need to hurt like I did, but I swear, if it focuses you like it did me, you’ll reach your goal and it will have been worth it. Women are waiting for you!"

"Title. I'm an average guy. Average face, average height, average skinny-fat body structure, average penis size, average to below-average parental income (which means basically 0 travels, 0 activities other that video games because otherwise too expansive).

I discovered a year ago self improvement, and that really hyped me up : I could get out of my miserable situation, improve my physique, get more social, I can work on that ! 

A year later, I struggle more and more to go to the gym. After a year, neither my face, my height nor my body structure have changed. I put on a shirt, and boom ! 1 year of progress invisible. I'm still the same invisible guy I was before. Like, why do I work if I can mildly change 1 thing, and 90% of what's visible is still the same ?

But I think the most depression thing is the penis size. Face and height ? Sure they help being attractive, but you can still work your way around. But not having a big dick ? This shit should be nerfed because of how much overpowered it is. You can get laid just because of it. You can have ONS, FWB and long term relation just because of it. You can be the worst POS on earth, and your ex will still cheat on her new boyfriend for you because of it. And the difference in how the sex is is just mind-blowing: most of women can't cum from PIV sex they say, but if your big you can make them cum several times in a session, and give a unique feeling that can't be replicated. And no amount of work will even change that. 

If I want my partner to be happy, why would I want her to settle for something that is not the best ? I don't want to give her an okey time that'll lead to a dead bedroom, I want to give her the best. But I can't. So why bother ? 

I don't want to be the one she settles for, the average guy, I want to be chosen.

And the responses to this type of insecurities are funny, especially the porn one : 
"" Porn really screw people, they think what they see in porn is real, like you need 10 inches to satisfy a woman, it creates too much insecurities "" 
"" Yeah, I used to think my dick was small because of me being 300 pounds of muscle and 6'5, despite my partners cumming multiple times in 3 minutes and all of my exes coming back, but fortunately I mesures I'm 8x6, porn really create insecurities!""
"" Yeah tell them ! ""

Like every time the story of a guy getting rid of the porn insecurities ends with him discovering he's big and-surprise !- it goes away, that really help people that aren't as lucky !

Is this a mess of a rant, filled with insecurities and logic fallacies ? Yes, I haven't still figured everything, and I know I have a lot of work to do, especially on the mental health side.

What are your interests? Try first making friends who share your interests, some of them will likely be women. It might be easier to make friends in your area online first, and then ease into meeting in person. 

Things to keep in mind:  
Women don't like men who act like they are entitled to their time and attention.    
Sometimes a woman you're interested in won't be interested in you. There's nothing wrong with either one of you.   
Spend at least as much time showing interest in her as you spend talking about yourself. (This may be the most important one.

"A few weeks ago I posted in another sub about a situation with my GF (Lisa) nudging me to try forms of non-monogamy that I wasn't comfortable with, and claiming I needed to ""compromise"" when I pushed back.

The consensus from comments on my post was that the relationship needed to end as her and I were clearly sexually incompatible, but deep down I was adamant that things could be salvaged somehow. Not long after our initial conversation, I explained to Lisa why her actions were wrong (pushing against my boundaries despite my repeated saying no), and she apologised to me. She suggested that we go away and write lists of activities that we would or wouldn't be comfortable engaging in, and seeing where we could find common ground or ""meet each other in the middle"". It seemed reasonable.

The other day, we sent each other our lists. Lisa was clearly disappointed with mine, as I more or less ruled out partaking in all of the ethnical non-monogamy (ENM) activities that she suggested. I made it clear that I was willing to partake in monogamous activities from her list that she enjoyed (e.g. toys), but that didn't seem to really cut it for her.

""It is what it is"" she said on the phone, with a sigh, her tone of voice one of clear disappointment. ""I'm the one who's losing out here. You get to keep everything you want to do, but I don't really get anything. It's fine though Ok\_Dress5215, it is what it is. I can just suppress my desires and keep them in my head.""

I really disliked her insinuation that I was being obtuse or selfish for not willing to compromise on my boundaries, and I asked why me being willing to try the monogamous activities she outlined didn't seem to count as meeting her in the middle. ""It's got to be spontaneous, and I want my partner to enjoy it too,"" which struck me as odd - I can't snap my fingers and suddenly change my enjoyment of or attitude towards a particular sexual activity.

I explained to Lisa that she was the one who told me a few weeks ago, with pretty stinging words, that our sex life was unexciting and unsatisfying for her, and that even after our list comparison exercise, the options for fixing this were clearly pretty limited, despite me being willing to give certain (monogamous) things a try. I told her that I now have all these ominous thoughts such as ""is my partner ever going to be sexually satisfied by me? Is she going to end up resenting or cheating on me?"" swirling in my mind, and that some kind of reassurance that these fears were misplaced or that we could work through this would really help me.

She immediately clapped back with ""well what about me? What about all the things I'm having to give up?"" That really got to me, and it reminded me of our previous conversation where she had basically showed no regard for my feelings with her constant nudging up against my boundaries. I felt myself getting angry and knew a shouting match would just make things worse, so I abruptly said goodnight and hung up on her.

Before I went to bed, she sent a barrage of texts, explaining that she was upset by the situation, that she wanted me to feel more ""remorseful"" because of all the things she now has to ""suppress and keep in \[her\] imagination"". She also expressed that she felt ""unappreciated"" for having to bury her sexual desires for the sake of the relationship.

This sat really uncomfortably with me. Why on earth would someone need to feel remorseful for not wanting to risk their own mental wellbeing just so their partner can feel sexually satisfied? That I need to ""appreciate"" her for this horrible anxiety about the relationship I now feel? If Lisa and I were in a dead bedroom or I was completely closed off to trying new things, I would understand, but not wanting to take part in ENM? I had said to her before that I was sorry that she felt like she was ""losing out"", but insinuating that upholding sexual boundaries is something I need to show remorse for is honestly pretty horrible.

My head is all over the place. I (perhaps naively) hoped that things between her and I could be salvaged by comparing our respective lists and working with the overlap between the two, but if anything it's just made it even more apparent that her and I are sexually incompatible, and frankly her way of handling the whole situation has really upset me. I feel like, as in my last post, she has no real regard for my feelings, and is just angling for the outcome she wants, this time with lousy attempts at guilt tripping. I don't think I can ignore the writing on the wall this time. I care about Lisa a lot but I hate how she keeps pushing and breaking me down like this, and her general lack of respect for my feelings and me as a person.

UPDATE: Lisa and I have broken up. I broke the news to her yesterday, first via text (I initially told her that we needed to talk on the phone, but she insisted that if it was to break up that I just tell her over text) and then confirming it on the phone. She was super tearful and keep insisting that this was all a giant misunderstanding, that she was sorry for how she had behaved and that she would never hurt me, that she is happy in our relationship.

It was really hard hearing her so upset but I stood my ground. To be honest, I felt like she was backpedaling on things she had said earlier and downplaying how important the ENM activities she wanted to try are (they are things that she had expressed interest in repeatedly very early on, and so can't be dismissed as passing fancies). I told her I appreciated her apologising but the damage was done,  I can't be in a relationship with someone I'm clearly sexually incompatible with, with no real chance of fixing it.

This was absolutely for the best but it still hurts. Lisa and I are giving each other some space. We had an upcoming trip together and I have a few of her things at mine, so we will have to meet up eventually to sort a few things out and maybe clear the air, and so I'll need to be strong and make sure I don't cave in. Thank you /r/offmychest for hearing me out and advising me, it means a lot.

It’s quite simple, she shouldn’t have agreed to get into a monogamous relationship if she’s not willing to be monogamous. Sometimes it works for couples, but it takes two to tango so you both have to be 100% in. It’s unfair on her to expect you to happily allow her to cheat on you. Basically, she wants to cheat on you but with your consent. Because you essentially aren’t giving her your ‘consent’ she’s guilt tripping you into agreeing. I think you should cut it off because you’ll find someone else who thinks that all of you and only you, is enough.

She’s trying to manipulate you into getting what she wants. This is a huge flag to part ways. She’s made it clear she wants this regardless of your feelings and that her holding back is a favor to you. All it will take is one nasty fight and she will give in to temptation. Whether she tells you or not is up for debate but it likely will happen. Her mindset isn’t on making a monogamous relationship work, she’s more interested in exploring with you as a safety net.

Hey, from someone who's poly, this is fucked. This is NOT ethical non-monogamy. Unfortunately, OP, your girlfriend doesn't care about your comfort or happiness. Only her own. It's time to re-evaluate your relationship, but instead of including more people, it needs to include one less.

"The audacity of her. ""What about ME?!"" 

Look, I am not against ENM at all, but both parties have to enthusiastically consent. Her trying to guilt you into it is NOT enthusiastic consent. At this point, put the ball in her court. 

""Is your desire for non monogamy more important than our relationship? This is a hard boundary for me.""

As in she wants to use you for the emotional elements and likely security of a relationship while also doing something that makes you unhappy and uncomfortable to meet her sexual needs. As a woman myself I think that’s just gross to put your partner through if they aren’t into it, especially considering women don’t want or appreciate being pressured into sexual things by their partners either.

She’s not wrong for having her needs/desires, but she does needs to accept that her sexual desires mean she’s not going to be in a relationship with you.

Yeah bro, sounds over. Sexual incompatibility is a pretty big deal breaker for most. And as you and others have identified, how she's handled this is actually a bigger issue. Manipulation via guilt tripping and being totally dismissive of your feelings is major. Even more so as it's applied to such a sensitive domain of intimacy. She's being selfish.

Honestly, her only options are breaking up with you or accepting that you don’t want to do ENM. You’re options are the same but reversed. She seems to manipulating you. Wishing or perpetrating shame, guilt or remorse on someone is abusive. I think you should break up because this will only get worse.

I told her that you can get close to other people but I don't want you to do anything until I'm ready. Fast forward to me being in the worst part of my life and having SI, I reached out to her only to have her drunkenly berate me for not allowing her to have sex with this guy she liked.

OP, when a woman says “our sex life has not been very exciting”, she has no intention to repair it. She wants to get hers elsewhere. No matter what you do, you won’t be able to get her as excited as someone new would. Especially coming out of a dead bedroom situation. 

Actually, this isn’t just a woman thing either. When my partner would get to the point of no longer willing to help me make things fun, I could spend weeks, months on trying to reboot things, until I give up. And once I give up, I’m checked out. there’s nothing she can do to entice me again. I bet she’s in the same boat. 

That’s why people were telling you to cut your losses. How much more suffering do you need to voluntarily stick around for? ‘Cause it’s a comin.

"I say this as a nonmonogamous person-- the way she is behaving is completely unacceptable.

It's already a really fraught thing to negotiate nonmonogamy in a monogamous relationship.  Like it can be tricky to be sure that everyone is truly consenting enthusiastically, and no one is agreeing to something they don't want because they are afraid of losing their partner.  Like seriously hard to navigate.  It takes time, patience, and most likely outside help.

But that's when everyone is saying yes.  You are saying no, and that should absolutely be the end of it.  You do not want a nonmonogamous relationship in any form.

At that point she has two ethical choices-- to end your relationship and pursue nonmonogamy elsewhere, or to accept that her relationship with you will be monogamous, and then choose to stay with you.

Either way, it's her choice.  She needs to own it.  You are not ""making"" her give anything up.  She can choose to give those things up, or she can GTFO.  Her choice.

She is trying to coerce consent out of you.  That is completely fucked up.  If she does not stop right now, I think for your own well being you will likely need to end your relationship with her.

There are women who will want what you want-- in fact, more people are monogamous than otherwise.

"Hi, polyamorous (ENM) person with two partners here.

In monogamous relationships, when ENM (and other forms under the polyam umbrella) is advised by one partner to the other due to being ""sexually unsatisfied"", 9 times out of 10 that relationship is destined to fail - especially if the one advising/asking is pushing the other, or ignoring their boundaries.

My advice to you would be to leave. Lisa clearly does not respect your wants, needs or boundaries, in general and in this situation, and probably won't change her mind or views.

You should have already left her the second this nonsense started coming out of her mouth.  The reason she is going in hard on this point is because she has some other dude she's either already fucking or has been planning to.

"Sorry, but your girlfriend is absolutely selfish and inconsiderate. In a committed relationship no-one should ever do something they do not feel comfortable with. Pressuring or guilt tripping your significant other into something they do not want is a major red flag.

I am polyamorous and in a long-term monogamous relationship. To me it never felt like oppressing anything. And even if did, I'd rather oppresse my desires (I' d not call these ""needs"") than suppresse the person I love. I feel love for more than one person, but would never pursue physical relationships with anyone besides my partner. Because I love him and I would never want to hurt him. (And of course I am always open about my feelings with my partner. We have a very open and healthy communication, based on a deep respect for each other.)

I do not want to tell you to break up with her, but I personally could not stay in a relationship with someone who respects and loves me so little that they feel the need to pressure me into giving up my boundaries. If someone claims they cannot be in a monogamous relationship then the right thing to do is break up and pursue the relationship that makes them happy. It is not right to force the monogamous partner to become someone they do not want to be. You are simply incompatible. And you deserve a partner with similar values and ideals in your relationship.

"As a person who lives in an ENM life, this isn’t something she’s just going to be able to live without. When someone IS a non-monogamous person, it’s just who they are. Same as being cis, gay, pan or a-sexual. It’s not a choice. The only choice is if we choose to accept it and pursue what fulfills our needs. Can she live without it? Sure! Will life be what she truly wants? No. Clearly. 

If you do not want ENM, that’s okay. Being open to non-monogamy isn’t for everyone. The thought of your partner falling in love with someone else can be scary. People like me feel compersion. When my partner is falling in love with another partner, I feel happy and embrace it because I know it doesn’t take away from my love with my partner. It adds to it. I don’t fear losing them because they are my life partner. A lot of men especially fear their partner with another man for multiple reasons. That’s a self esteem and paternal fear. It’s also understandable. It’s a lot to work through for some people. 

If you two have these different sexualities, it clearly points out that you are not sexually aligned. Could you two attempt force the relationship to work? Yes. Painfully. Happiness won’t last much longer. Just maybe contentment. I don’t know if that’s what you want for either of you. Eventually, she will have to do something to meet her needs. And I mean NEEDS. These aren’t wants. Not meeting someone’s sexual needs in a healthy way leads to them doing it deviantly. Needs get met healthily or deviantly. That’s how things work. 

If you truly love her you have to take a step back and reassess what that means:

Do you want her to live an unfulfilled life with you where she isn’t getting her needs met just because that’s what you want? This can lead to disappointment, dissatisfaction, resentment and a horrible end to the relationship. Is it possible she lives a happy fulfilling life in this option? Not really, no. That’s why she has brought all this up in the first place. It’s not who she is or what she wants. 

Are you willing to be uncomfortable and accept that if you want to have her and her love in your life that means ENM? That means a LOT of work, communication and trust! This can lead to finding even more love to share with the person you love. It can also turn into a disaster and end badly anyway. 

Or do you love her enough to accept that even though you love her, you aren’t sexually compatible and you’re willing to end the relationship so she can find the life that will fulfill her needs? This will also allow you to find someone who aligns with your sexual orientation.

But, I disagree or at least won't be si quick to judge on her trying to manipulate you, her being a horrible person and if she wants ENM she should have dated some who wants to.  
We simply don't have that much information about her. I know a few people who practice polyamory and open relationships, with some I even witnessed how they started their journey into this and it can be really messy. Just because someone wants to do ENM (or at least thinks they want) doesn't mean that they know how to do it right. Also sometimes it happens that those ideas also only start when alret within a monogamous relationship.  
Also the way you described her lashing out feels rather than frustration breaking out than a masterful plan to manipulate  you into what she wants.  
Doesn't justify her lashing out, but gives it a different perspective.  
You know best if she is rather a good person with flaws that genuinely likes you and hoped for this to work or that she is indeed evil to the core.

Lisa is gaslighting you to try to make you feel it's your fault, not hers, that she is not satisfied. You need to ask yourself, can I continue in the relationship at this pace, and with these demands if she never backs down? If not, then it's time to push back and tell her if she can't respect your boundaries, that it's time that she finds someone else who can meet her needs.

I have no issue with ENM or people who enjoy it but what she’s asking for isn’t ENM. That requires active and enthusiastic consent and participation from both parties to truly be ethical. If you’re not up for it but she’s forcing you, she might just cheating on you while you allow it. It sounds more to me like she just wants permission to cheat rather than an actual polyamorous relationship. She’s pushing you into it because she knows you won’t look for sex elsewhere while she does.

I’m not too sure how to explain this but my grandpa makes me very uncomfortable. I grew up at my maternal grandparents house, they took care of me all the times while my parents worked relentlessly when I was a child. I was very close with them, as I got older, I got more distant from them because of some family tensions between my dad and them. I noticed that as I got older he’s been more touchy. He has never done anything in a sexual nature to me or anything in that area but he’s very touchy. He will hug me or grab my shoulders or pull me in. I hate being touched, so this makes me very uncomfortable. I really hate it. My family never seems to think anything about it. He also always brags about me while I’m there and always seems to either brag or ask me if I remember a specific moment while my boyfriend or friends are around almost as if he’s jealous and he’s implying, “I know her better than you do.” It’s really weird and it makes me really uncomfortable because he’s trying to paint me as if I’m perfect or as if I’m so good at everything. I hate it because I can feel the discomfort from my boyfriend or friends and they can even tell how uncomfortable I feel. He also says my boyfriends name wrong on purpose to me. He never does it in front of him but he does it in a way as if he’s making fun of his name. My boyfriend senses my discomfort when I’m with him and he doesn’t like to leave me alone with him. The first time I brought my boyfriend around to meet my grandparents, my grandpa flaunted his money in front of my boyfriend by giving me a $100 bill for “good grades”. Keep in mind he never does this one on one, ONLY in front of other people. Almost as if he’s trying to seem like such a great and wealthy person who spoils his grand children. I felt so uncomfortable in that moment. Anyway, these past few days my boyfriend and I have been doing house and yard work for my grandparents. When we were leaving yesterday, he blew kisses at my car window before we left. I just laughed uncomfortably, but we left and my boyfriend looked creeped out and I was so embarrassed and kind of horrified at that. I really don’t know what to do. Also I don’t think it is an option to bring this up to my mother because she gets really angry at the mention of any bad thing about her parents. Please help me. I don’t know what this means or what to do and I’m starting to reach my breaking point.	Existing_Air_909	post	18.21955938378735	female	White	0.9992886781692505	na	na	na	1	offmychest	failed
you're getting the ick from grandpa. you could either exploit it by bringing more people around and getting 100$ more often, hey free money. or you could set boundries with your grandpa make sure that your grandma and someone else you trust is there. Dont use accusatory language use I statements like I feel uncomfortable when I'm touched like this. this helps to keep tensions low and helps lessen the blow to egos while getting your point across. make sure you enforce the boundries you want set and get comfortable with saying no.

"Tw: Child SA, sh, suicide, depression, anxiety

I’ll try to keep this short.

I’ve had no social skills my entire life. I still don’t. It has affected me to the extreme, due to me not having many friends and never having a gf. And where I lived, if you didn’t have a partner, you were considered almost sub human. Anyway, eventually I told my friends about it, as the but of a joke. And they spread it around my entire school. I was constantly laughed at and made fun of for being a v*rgin at 17, at a time where people where people were openly talking about how abortions were a godsend because “everyone is***** at the school”. Eventually, the pressure got too much  and I got desperate. Now I hated sexual experiences for a very long time. I was r*ped by my brother and sa’d by my mother, so the very thought of sex could send me into a panic attack. But like I said, the pressure and hate became too much, and eventually I stared to do research on escorts, hookups, etc. I started to sh myself to get the pain out, because my “friends” form of greeting me was telling me to take my own life. Eventually, it all became too much. I couldn’t get the money for an escort, the hookup sites were not working, and no matter how many dr*gs I took, alcohol I drank, etc. I could still not flirt and escalate things beyond friendly conversation (still can’t flirt to this day). So I attempted suicide 3 times. First by trying to bleed out, second by od, and third and most recent (a month ago) by playing RR. They obviously all didn’t work, and I’m in a lot better position now. I’m at college, away from my parents, and I love myself now. I’ve gotten over the horror of sex, and can now say that I’m the proud owner of two sex toys. While my lack of sexual experience is still a point of shame for me, i know things will pass eventually."

"I'm so sorry you've had such a hard life.  Your problems aren't because you're a virgin, they are because you've been deeply hurt by people that were supposed to love and protect you.  You need to see a therapist.  These kind of scars don't just go away, it'll be a long process to heal but a counselor/therapist can help.  

Personally I'd like to see your brother and mom punished.  However, we all know that doesn't come without a cost to you, and I really don't want to see you hurt further.  At the very least I hope you can keep those two out of your life forever.

Thanks. That means a lot. I’m a lot better now, just still feel ashamed because of the whole virgin thing, though that’s mainly bc of the environment I grew up in. Trying to get a gf was very traumatic for me. I’ve never had a gf obviously, and the last time I asked one out I got called a homophobic slur.

"I posted something about 2 weeks ago on how I was abused when I was little. It was purely to get it off my chest and to tell someone despite it being online. This post, to my surprise, racked 8.1k views. 

Since then I've had two types of DM's. The first are from absolute creeps who obviously get off on my trauma and abuse. They were reported and blocked.

The others are from people, who to me, are trying to justify my abusers actions. I felt sick reading them and so blocked them. My abuser was old enough to know what the hell they were doing, and what they were doing was wrong. 

I don't find comfort in knowing I 'helped' my abuser. He used me. Its not a comforting thing to say to somebody who's been abused. 

And I know i can't really blame these people for having an opinion. I posted it online, I knew there was always a possibility of receiving weird messages.

"I was added to a gc a few days ago where a bunch of guys from school tore my looks to shred. They made fun of the fact that I wear tape in extensions, the fact that my forehead was big, how I'm so ugly, *how nobody will ever want me* and horrendous things about my body. 

I also endure this in school. I remember when a group of popular people threw a football at my face and proceeded to laugh without saying sorry. It was so embarassing running out of class crying. It's not like I don't try either. I purposefully put on a lot of makeup to reduce my forehead size, even my skin out, yet I **still** get called ugly???  I wish this wasn't just limited to school but it's everywhere, I went to a camp and experienced the same treatment and isolation from both boys and girls. I tried **very** hard to be pretty but I was still ignored, skipped when socializing. 

Almost **all** my friends have relationships and as the ugly friend, I'm the odd one out. I feel as though whenever I express this people will tell me to just ""love myself"". It's so hard to love yourself when nobody else around you loves you. I just want to be treated like a human being, have the typical teenage romance that my friends have, look in the mirror and be happy with what I see, be able to go to school without crying in the bathrooms. ***I just want to exist.***

We talked about how far more people gush about her beauty than anything else. Unfortunately, once her bullies realized words weren't going to work, things turned physical. My wife and I assured her that we 100% had her back if things got bad. There were a few minor scuffles that ended up with the bullies being suspended. Ultimately we just switched to another school in the district and now that rough past is simply a fading memory.

I was never a bully, but I was always kinda popular just cause I would throw house parties, but also cause I wasn’t scared to give someone a hiding if they tried to start anything with me. I’m not saying resort to violence at all BUT sometimes it does solve the issue when you’re in those high school years. For example, I threw a house party at 15 and like 200+ people showed up to my house, which wasn’t normal. I found out a girl I thought was my friend broadcasted it on bbm (bbm is like msn if you know what that is, may be too young) and well I got so angry I punched her and we had a fight. (I had got kicked out of school previously btw) so fast forward to a couple of months later, I told my mum I want to go back to school and so on, so then I enrolled in this new school. It turns out two of her family members were girls in my year and obviously they didn’t like me because I had beaten up their cousin so they proceeded to try and ‘bully’ me. I tried to ignore it because I was serious about passing my exams (this was my last chance) but there was one time we had class together and they pushed too far. I switched (I was an angry, hot headed teen in general anyway) and I literally threw my chair at them both. Safe to say, they both apologised and left me be after that stunt. People pick on people they think are weaker than them. I’m really not saying have the same response as me, but what I am saying is stick up for yourself, pick on their insecurities and see how they like it. I’m sure it will soon stop!

"Submit the screenshots to your school administration...

But, and here's the hard part, shitty people will find reasons to be shitty regardless of what you do. If YOU like how you look, cultivate that. Enjoy doing things for yourself. If you are doing them so people who are ALREADY awful will like you? It will never happen. They already showed they won't.

Bullying is incredibly hard to endure and I am so sorry you are. I grew up the fat girl in glasses who got asked out as a joke or a dare. I never dated. I didn't go to dances. I got made fun of..

And those people are now equally moderately successful 40 year olds who are indistinguishable from me. Why? Because no one gives two fucks who wss popular in high school once it's over. Dudes wax poetic about their ""glory days"" and get dragged for being losers. Women who can't let go of their prom queen memories are relentlessly stereotyped as lacking substance.

People will ALWAYS find something. Humans are...awful. But listen, you will find your people. The people that don't give a shit if you have extensions or a 5head (rihanna has a 5head and not one person is going to try it). 

Adulthood will sort of be the great leveler where for the most part? Folks stop focusing as much on ""pretty"".

"High school was the *lowest* point in my life. I’m 32. I was friendless, bullied, riddled with anxiety, and wanted to die. Literally. It was a horrible time and I used to envy the people who would “go back to high school in a heartbeat”. Now I pity them. People who peak in high school roll down the back side of that hill the rest of their life. While you are only beginning to grow and find yourself they will never be bigger than they are right now. It only gets better. I promise that 99% of people are not like that once you get out of high school. And the ones that are like that you can much more easily distance yourself from them. You’re not forced to be around them all the time. 

Out of high school it’s a lot easier to be with your own people and create a real circle of people who encourage and support you as opposed to putting you down. Stop trying to be this that or another. Just be yourself. It’s so much easier and you find confidence in the fact that you stop trying to be something you aren’t. You’ll never be pretty to everyone but you can be your pretty. You can emphasize the parts that you love and other people will feed off your confidence and love it themselves too. Once you stop hating on what other people don’t like and really take a good look at yourself and appreciate what you are it gets so much easier to be confident.

I went through the same thing when I was a teenager in high school, and now I would say I’m above average attractive, guys are all over me wherever I go, I have plenty of pretty privilege. And I didn’t have surgery or a massive glow up, I just grew up, lost a little baby fat and learned how to groom myself properly. 15 is a very awkward age and you have at least 5 years until reaching your actual potential. When people bully you like that, it’s not even about your looks, it’s always coming from themselves- would you bully a person who you think is ugly? Probably not! Teenagers tend to be like that, they group against an individual who seems most insecure or fragile and take their frustration out on them because they want to feel strong and empowered.

"Hey, kiddo. I was you, once. Except in my day, the internet wasn't in our faces constantly and I at least could find respite after school was over. I can't imagine that makes this kind of treatment any easier. 

It isn't right. It's not fair. And the absolute worst part is nobody in a position to put an end to it is gonna do a damn thing. I don't say this to make you sad or feel hopeless, I say it because I want you to know that I know EXACTLY where you're coming from.

This absolutely sucks, but I'm gonna impart to you some wisdom that helped me along the way. I've been married 7 years this December, so all those boys who said nobody would want me were not only wrong... some of them are working on their 2nd, even 3rd divorces. Those boys don't know shit. And they aren't shit.

I know some shit, though:

1) Don't feed them your tears. Yes, I know how hard it is not to cry in front of them. Don't let them have it. Do let it out when you're safe, because it's absolutely something to cry over. Sometimes, the less you respond, the less appealing a target you become. This doesn't always work, but if you provide no pain for them to be amused by they will search for it elsewhere.

2)Remember that this isn't forever. It feels like it, and every single day feels weightier than the last. I promise, cross my heart, that things get better after high school. The things that make you happy RIGHT NOW? Those things are forming the foundation of your purpose and passion in life. That is what matters. Make time every single day to immerse yourself in what makes you happy. 

3) Your online friends are more precious than gold. Those are the people who will get you through this. Nowadays it's easier than ever to make pals online, it's also easy to carve out a private little space of your own to vent and cultivate your interests. Even running an anonymous moodboard blog on Tumblr will connect you with others, either directly or indirectly.

4) Accept the things you can't change, which really boils down to: be nicer to yourself. People are crappy enough to you, the last bully you need is yourself. So what if your forehead is big? You didn't choose that, you didn't pick it any more than you picked your zodiac sign or the zip code you were born in. The fact that you are here at all is amazing to begin with.

That’s why the guys and girls who are prettiest in HS don’t turn out to be the most attractive when they’re 32. 

Your face will keep shifting, evolving and morphing. That big forehead will one day be balanced out and in proportion to the rest of your face. 

For all those pretty popular boys and girls - their noses will keep going, their eyes will get wonkier, etc. 

They’re peaking in HS and it will be all downhill from here for them. 

You will transform into a swan. I promise. I know. 

Money, time, knowledge of the best colors and makeup, the best way to present yourself - AND AGING - will do wonders for you.

I'm not saying this blindly. I'm saying this because the majority of my teenage years was what you're going through.

I was isolated - my bullies would bully anyone who was a friend of mine, so I lost every friend and wasn't able to make new ones.

It gets better. Talk to a therapist. It will truly, truly help. Tell your parents that you need to talk to someone who isn't them, even though you'll still talk with them about things.

Focus on yourself. Find a sport or physical hobby, like weight lifting or dance or something, and work out your mental and physical health. It will help you gain confidence in the face of the haters.

As you get through painful, compassionate-person-creating stages of life, you grow. You mature. You find other good people and you find comfort, laughter, and companionship in them. You end up falling in love with people, and breaking up, and doing it all over again, until you figure out what you want for your whole future and see how it plays out.

"Hey, I've had this exact kind of thing happen to me multiple times when I was your age (I'm 26 now)

If you feel comfortable enough, report it to your school. And tell your parents. There may be repercussions for their actions. 

If you don't feel comfortable enough to do that, and I know this sounds cliche, but honest to God /ignore them/. What they want from you is a reaction. They want to hurt your feelings, they want to fuel their egos by bringing you down. It's very hard and it took me a long time to learn, but if you just pretend that they don't exist, they will eventually lose interest. 

This is temporary, you will not have to be around these people forever. 

You're not ugly. And even if you're a little ugly now, we all were at 15. It's a rough age.

"Honey, do not try to please everybody. Love yourself. You know that you are capable of awesome things. You know that you are an awesome person. Look at yourself and dress accordingly. Do not try to follow what's popular if you will suffer in the end. Sometimes the price of vanity is too high, and we cannot afford it.

Wear what is comfortable, focus on your interests. Don't think much about boys, especially teenage boys. They are just a bag of hormones trying to make themselves sound bigger and better than anybody else. YOU DO NOT NEED TO BE IN A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP. You should focus on yourself and try to love yourself. You are your own best friend and your number 1 fan. I know how you feel, as I was once a teenager. So what if others are in a relationship? Would you die if you are not in one? NO. Move on with your life.

If social media makes you suffer, avoid socmed, and just stick to the messaging apps.

Read a book. Or many books.

Just focus on you.

Know yourself. Love yourself.

Do not worry, it does get better that I can promise. 

As I matured the feature I was  teased about ended up being some of my best features. I had a severe overbite that braces helped later in life. They teased me bc of my buttocks and the way I walked. They teased my nose. My boobs . The way I ran. I was called ugly. I was relentlessly teased by boys. Turns out, every boy that was really harsh tried to date me or liked me later in life. I ignored. Now I’m not saying it’s ok for a boy that likes you to bully you. I hate that logic. I’m just pointing out how hypocritical bullies are.

For context I at the time 7 or 8M had three older siblings the two oldest seemed to really like me but the sister I replaced as the baby of the family 12 F despised me and always pushed me away when I tried to play or do something together unfortunately she hated me. At one point in time she asked me to come in to her room I got excited because every time I went in there she always screamed at me to get out so this was new and interesting to me note I’m autistic and was  underweight at the time. Basically she told me she wanted to play a game with me and said that in the game she was my boss (because she was older) and I was a model and she told me to strip down to my underwear and convinced me it wasn’t indecent because swimsuits then when I was in my underwear she put duct tape over my mouth pulled my underwear down and knees me in the groin I’m not sure on the order but next thing I knew I was naked with my arms held behind my back kneeling on the floor basically she said she would be nice if I did what she said and she made me model in order her underwear a pair of booty shorts and a pink shirt then skort then a sundress and a one piece swimsuit that was too loose and the final humiliation was a princess dress I cried the entire time and she hit me over and over then she said she would kill me if I told anyone and kicked me out of her room and into the hall still in the dress and I hid in the bathroom until the coast was clear and ran straight into my bedroom to make matters worse apparently my mom saw me but didn’t say anything at the time but later we had an incredibly awkward conversation wear I dodged her questions and she probably still thinks I used to crossdress for fun now my gf wants me to crossdress in the bedroom which while I’m definitely a fan of it it makes me sick to think my sister gave me a fetish and my mom probably knows about it because she knows I borrowed one of her dresses without asking when I was fourteen and has dropped hints and “accidentally”  put girly clothes in my clean laundry she also was a knock amd enter without permission parent this hole thing is fucked up amd I don’t know what to think	Huntingsword	post	18.988915038730692	female	White	0.9991612434387207	na	na	na	3	offmychest	'ethnicity: no prediction, age: mid to late teens, gender: male, explanation: the author refers to himself as 'm', indicating male and he shared a childhood memory where he was 7 or 8 years old, indicating he might be a teenager or older now. no specific information is provided about his ethnicity.'

I was a hopeful 14-year-old when I immigrated from the Philippines to the United States. I wanted to achieve a lot of Pinoy kids’ dream of attending a fancy college in the US and being their lola’s (grammy) favorite apo (grandchild).

But I have finally decided that tonight, I will sit down and talk to my parents to undo that dream.

I found out that I couldn’t afford to go to college when I received my first acceptance letter from Fordham, my excitement was quickly replaced with fear upon realizing that they were asking me for $48,000 per year. 

While I was applying, my parents made me think that as long as I get excellent grades and qualify for scholarships, my schooling will be taken care of. As much as I wanted to be mad at them, they’re both immigrants and doesn’t know any better than me. I also found out that they do not have “college funds” saved up and that’s when I realized that I will have to take out loans to afford college.

I did my research and was utterly mortified when I found out that some people end up paying three times the amount they originally borrowed because of interest and some even pass their debts to their spouses. It broke my heart but I decided that it wasn’t worth it. I talked to my parents and told them that I wanted to go back home instead. I figured, since I’m going to have to opt to go to my cheapest option and not a school that I necessarily want to attend, might as well just go to the Philippines where in I can attend top universities for much, much cheaper.

My parents, of course, refused. They called me names, told me that I am being an entitled brat, and that I’m wasting opportunities that others would kill for. I was disheartened, I became very depressed. I continued to beg them to change their minds but it did not come to fruition. 

I ended up attending a $24,000 a year out-of-state public university.

During my freshman year, I spiraled into severe depression. I simply couldn’t handle the burden of having that much debt tied to my name. 

I am a person who genuinely enjoys learning but my student loans took away that joy. Every time I fail to understand a lesson, I experience an immense amount of anxiety. A simple quiz, a home work, an exam—they were all matters of life and death to me. I couldn’t let myself fail because if I do, I’ll lose my scholarship and I will have to take out more loans than I already have. I wanted to die. Every single minute of my life. All I thought of was ending my life.

I tried seeing a counselor but due to language and cultural barriers, it really didn’t help.

Everything became even worse first semester of my sophomore year when I found out that I lost my scholarship (contracted Covid, couldn’t take finals, two classes were INC and weren’t counted in my final credits taken therefore I don’t have enough credits to satisfy my scholarship requirements).

My depression became even worse. I would stand beside the busy highway for hours on end hoping I’ll have the courage to jump in front of a moving car. But I just couldn’t do it. Every time I wanted to die, the thought of my sister not being able to go to college because I passed on my loans to my parents hunts me. I couldn’t even kill myself even if I wanted to.

Does it even make sense for a 20-year-old to have almost 85,000 USD worth of debt? 

I need help. I tried seeing a psychiatrist but ironically, it made me even more depressed because it costed my parents $120 per session.

I went to the Philippines for several weeks this summer and it broke my heart seeing how happy my friends are, and how that could have been my life too.

It’s been looming in my mind since I came back from vacation and I keep thinking if I’m really ready to leave the comfort US offers me and trade it for the wildly humid and scorching hot weather in Manila.

I came to the conclusion that the pollution, traffic, and humidity, I can get used to again. It’s nowhere near as bad as the demons haunting me inside my air conditioned dorm room.

So, tonight, I’m finally doing it. I’m putting my foot down and I am telling my parents that I am going back home."	seulgibearr1	post	20.42089803080943	female	White	0.9987101554870605	na	na	na	1	offmychest	'ethnicity: asian, age: 20, gender: uncertain, explanation: the writer self-identifies as an immigrant from the philippines, therefore making him/her asian. the author mentions that they are 20 years old. there is no indication of the author's gender in the post.'

i am so perpetually confused. i used to think it was because i spent the vast majority of my 20 years of life alone and with little to no close friends, no deep relationships with anyone. but now i've been in a relationship, i am currently in another one, 2 years together, i have more friends. and still i cant seem to get what the right thing to do is, ever. i never know what i'm supposed to say to confort someone, when i fuck up, what people expect from me and what is reasonable to expect from others. i am so lost, all the time. i feel stupid. i feel like i am constantly playing a game with people who have been playing for years and i just can't understand the rules. what is wrong with me. people are patient with me, but they are not going to stick forever. my partner's already said it. i just fuck up so many times. i say what's on my mind and it doesnt work, i stay silent and it doesnt work, i try to measure and pick my words carefully and it doesnt work. nothing i do works. i dont understand. sometimes people think i'm doing this on purpose, playing dumb and refusing to change my ways. but that's not true. i feel terrible, i am so confused what am i supposed to do. i'm sorry for the mistakes this is just a meaningless rant. i just feel like a dumb idiot and i dont know what's wrong with me. 	kuromiisdaddy	post	30.539299782625427	female	White	0.9993531107902527	na	na	na	0	offmychest	no prediction.
"it happened about 6 months ago. i can’t remember who initiated it, it just happened. i’m not proud of it, i knew this person was in a relationship and hooked up with him multiple times anyway. i nearly lost a few friends meanwhile the guy, who was also in the friend group, got just a slap on the wrist. even months after i ended the fling they still seem to hold resentment against me and not him. i didn’t know his girlfriend personally but from what i’ve heard she seems like a really sweet person, but very naive. he told me this was her first real relationship, but he always spoke poorly of her. he’d sweet talk me and flirt with me in really weird ways, say nasty things like he’d rather be with me but “she’s in the way” and weird shit like when we watched romantic movies together he’d say “they’re just like us” and “i think i’ll break up with her after a few months.” he was charming, and i was insecure. i liked the feeling of being wanted, he frequently implied that we would be together soon. obviously i was being duped, he had no intention of ever being with me. after i ended the fling i decided to DM her essentially saying everything. everything we did, everything he said about her that i could remember, and that i was incredibly sorry. i don’t know what happened behind the scenes, i know she confronted him about it but they’re still together. i don’t know what he said, maybe he said it was all lies, i have no idea, but i feel bad for her. i’m definitely no saint but he’s a nasty guy, and i hope she gains the confidence to leave him. he actually said to me: “i don’t think i know how to be a good partner or how to be good to the people i love.” such an odd thing to say that definitely indicates a lot of internal issues. he also said i “ruined his life” even though he made the same choices i did, still has a girlfriend, and none of our friends seemed to give that much of a shit about his part in this meanwhile they started to hate me. 

and maybe i shouldn’t, but i still hang out with him, as a friend. supposedly he told his GF we were hanging out we friends and she was fine with it and like i said he’s kind of in my social circle. i liked him better as a friend more than a partner or.. as a side piece anyways. we didn’t hang out or talk for a long time after i spilled everything to his gf though, he said he needed time process everything and to “get over me.” we now frequently talk and hang out as friends, but sometimes i question why. he’s slimy, i don’t trust him, and sometimes i’m even angry at him for not standing up for me when our mutual friends started essentially bullying me. but that’s a whole other complicated situation."

i feel no attraction to him anymore. as long as his girlfriend’s fine i see no issue with being friends with him. and i gotta disagree with the “there’s no just being friends after that.” i think you 100% can be friends with someone you used to date or be intimate with in any way. one of my closest friends is my ex, we mutually broke up years ago. there’s no awkwardness or lingering feelings on both sides. i don’t think it’s wrong for me to be friends with him, he seems slightly awkward when we hang out but there’s no attraction on my end and i won’t let anything happen	No-Pizza2540	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9894049763679504	weak	no	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.

"I don't legally own the dog to say more correctly but my sister and her husband let me take care of it and it sleeps in my room. It was originally my mother's who passed when I was 13 and I'm 17 now. (It doesn't bother me and in fact I even make jokes about it sometimes) I don't not want it anymore. I know I prefer my cat over my dog and even want a bird in the future but my dog? 

I find myself hoping it dies before I mange to get a job and get my own apartment, it feels too cruel to put down the animal just for me not wanting it. He's getting old which wouldn't be a problem if he didn't snap at the puppies that my sister and brother in law got which isn't his fault. Hell I don't even like the puppies.

I hate myself for not taking the option when my sister offered to take care of him instead, I hate myself for letting the dog gets attached to me, I hate myself for thinking I loved the animal when in reality it felt like I had to keep him for my mother's sake.

I no longer... Think to highly of my mother we'll just say. It'sore effort to put in caring for him and doing the usual maintenance for him, especially since I can barely take care of myself due to my depression and my dog is also suffering for that. I still feed and love on him but I don't bathe him like I should and my bond with him isn't like mine and my cat's which again isn't his fault.

I just don't know what to do, I don't want to keep taking care of him but I also don't want to rehome him or put him down because he doesn't deserve that, I'm also afraid of what my sister may say if I tell her what I feel and that I want to give him to her.

It's not fair on him that I keep hoping he dies.

Extra information; 
I live with my sister and her husband, my father isn't exactly great to take care of me and my well my mother is dead. I have a brother but we don't talk and I don't know how old the dog is, my best guess is 7 but I'll update if I found out his actual age."	throwawayforeverlove	post	19.06688104763734	female	White	0.9874618649482727	na	na	na	2	offmychest	no prediction.

Main because he's used to us and he's already lost my mother I don't want him to have to lose anyone else, I'll at least be around still so he doesn't feel he lost me too.

So, a bit of backround info, we have been friends for two years. I was her friend ever since she joined our class, along with three others in our friendgroup. We were five but two changed schools and one started hanging out with her other friends so it was just us two, me and her, left. So we started hanging out with the other guys a bit, first we were four, us two and two guys. Soon it started to be multiple, and now almost all the guys in our class, about a bit morr than half I think, are usually hanging out with us. Lately she has started ditching me a bit. Like, she wont wait for me to get my things before lunch sometimes, like today, and just went ahead with the others, and left me behind all alone. When I came to lunch, she said something like 'Hahah I left you even though I said I'd wait for you' in a joking matter. I didn't respond but just sat down and started eating. In another instance in P.E. a while ago she said something like 'im only playing badminton with you because you're good now' which I didn't really know how to respond to because it didn't really sound like something she'd say, but now I just dont know. I often feel outside in conversations and stuff, it feels like im just there while they hang out and im only her friend because she pitys me or something. I also usually bake and give her nuffins and other stuff when I bake. I dont know if im just overreacting or not so thats why I want to get some other opinions before doing something I might regret. We also sit next to eachother in class and will be in the same class for 2 more years.	Hon3y_Iav3nder	post	10.151265056943709	male	White	0.0062038348987698555	na	na	na	7	offmychest	no prediction.

I posted the figures I was looking for and the people who replied don't seem to understand me when I ask for a picture of the product. They just send me the original promotional picture of these figures. I had a guy say he didn't have the figure but could get it for me... ummmm no, I'm trying to stay safe and you're sounding shady.

Okay I do not even post on this account I guess and I dont even use reddit but I am having a crisis. It all started when I was looking for some fantasy toys to buy in the future and I was then wondering, why lets say a centaur centered one looked like a horses ( you know) and is it BAD if its a centaur cuz its half horse but the other half is human but is it still odd for it to be a horses you know? and THEN I got to thinking about how people wanna bang werewolves with knots and shit, like the ones on two legs not four, and can they even consent and is that considered zoophilia? I am not a zoophile in anyway and I despise them, I am not sexually attracted to animals either. I am just having a crisis.

"I wish someone wouldve shouted this at me a couple years ago, or when i was a child.
Or just explained to me why it is so important, and how filthy it is to not brush them. 

You may think its a basic routine for everyone, but many of you would get surprised. 
Im in the same boat, i could blame my upbringing, childhood, traumas, etc. 
Sure these things played a part, but at the end of the day im the one that shouldve been grabbing that brush everyday.

I cant smile, i cant talk, because im trying to hide my biggest flaw, my teeth. My life could be amazing, if i didnt ignore mouth. Also, once i realized that this is a big problem i almost gave up on it completely since they were pretty bad already, , thinking it cant get worse, it can. Pain is so severe i was sweating the other day. Im pretty sure there are millions of people in the same situation as me. Obviously we are stuck, because it costs a fortune to fix them. So while finally its in my everyday routine, i doubt it will get any better in this life. 

So please, start brushing your teeth.

a couple nights ago around 3am my sister and i were dropping some clothes off in the donation bins at our local thrift store. there was a man and woman outside going through some things that were left out by the bins. when we pulled up in front of the building she said “sorry girls, im just cleaning, someone made a mess out here” and i said something along the lines of “you’re fine, here’s some more stuff you can go through, there’s a lot of clothes in here” and left the two bags beside them. the man just looked over at me in a smiling/laughing way and neither of them said anything. i felt awkward and embarrassed that i just assumed they were homeless and i haven’t stopped thinking about it since. i’m a really nervous/awkward person as is and have a tendency to just blurt out things but i don’t mean any harm by it. it was really late at night the parking lot was empty and they got there on bikes so i just assumed they needed some stuff. maybe they were strolling by on their bikes, noticed the mess and wanted to clear the walkway or could they have been pretending to clean so it didn’t look like they were “stealing”? i’ve been overthinking the whole situation and feel really ignorant for saying that to them, i wish i could apologize. it was a complete word vomit moment.	girl-rotting	post	31.647194478972082	male	White	0.9981684684753418	na	na	na	3	offmychest	no prediction.

"When I was 19 and young and naive I met this guy in a club. He was 26, arrogant, he drove a motorcycle, so my stupid self thought he was the coolest guy ever and I was totally"" in love"". 
Well, I was blind for all the red flags and his problematic manipulative behaviour. I wasn't on birth control so I wanted to use a condom. He said that was childish and typically something an ""inexperienced child"" would say, so he wouldn't use one and pulled out even though I was severely uncomfortable with it. Sometimes I would tell him I wouldnt have sex with him unless he wore a condom, but he just pulled it off during sex without me seeing/knowing..
Well, of course I became pregnant after 6 months of dating. I was scared. I was a university student living in a small studio. I was in low contact with my parents (narcistic stepmom, whole other story), so I had no one to turn to, except a few friends. 
He was already bored with me so he was acting like a jerk even before I found out..Ignoring me and all. My best friend had to beg him to call me immediately because he wouldnt pick up his phone (and he verbally attacked her for calling him).
When he finally called me back I told him I was pregnant, I couldn't keep it because I was too young and I was going to get an abortion. His response was something like: oh dammnit..ugh, ok abortion is the best thing to do. Let me know when you had the procedure.
(Not even offering to take me to the clinic or asking me how I felt)
I was sick for 2 weeks, I felt really pregnant and I started having doubts about the abortion.
I texted him that I wasnt sure anymore if I really wanted to do it.
He exploded. Forced me into doing it. Told me that he would cut the baby out of me with his own hands if he had to. If I kept the baby and would hide it he would find me and kill me and the child. Called me a sexist slur. Said that the baby probably wasnt even his. Then he Hung up and texted me pictures of knives and bloody skulls all night. (His family had money and he had some relatives with ""connections"" so his threats weren't just bluff..)
I was terrified and had the abortion a week after this conversation. Texted him it was done and never heard from him.
(Fun fact :another friend of mine met him years after and he told her about me: ""the silly young girl I got pregnant ha ha"")

I went into a depression after the abortion, because I felt guilty about ending the pregnancy. I wasnt able to continue my study. I wanted to kill myself.  I only got out of it (eventually) because of my friends, my strong will and hours and hours of therapy.
I am doing ok today. I have a nice job, a place to live, a good boyfriend and great friends.
But today I scrolled through social media and he was there. He was interviewed for a local newspaper. His eyes, his smile.. were just as arrogant as all those years ago.
My hands started to shake, my heart started to hurt.  I didnt ever wanted to see his face again. Here he is just floating through live. He fucked up my life, he damaged me and didnt even care. I am so upset with myself that just his picture immediately caused a reaction in me. I thought I was healed, but am I really..? I feel so weak right now..

TL;DR I saw a picture of my scumbag of an ex who forced me to get an abortion and it did upset me, even after all those years of therapy"	Flat_Luck6517	post	19.205945979315853	female	White	0.9985710382461548	na	na	na	1	offmychest	no prediction.

I feel like a fucking stupid mentally disabled all around dumbass idiot. I am 22 and I’m supposed to be going back to my college that’s multiple hours away next week. Ive had a car for awhile and have been trying to learn to drive all summer. As the title states I just failed my test for the second time. I feel completely demoralized. I feel like I’m mentally handicapped and there’s something wrong with me. My state has one of the hardest license tests in the country, yet, there are fucking SIXTEEN year olds here driving and passing on the first time. What’s wrong with me? I want to die so bad. I’ll be living off campus this semester so having my car and license would’ve made my life so much easier but of course I had to fail. I’m so stupid.

sorry if this is a semi long post. I just need to get this off my chest and ask for advice i guess. So i 24(m) have been with my now ex for 3 years 21(f), I thought this girl was my soulmate and she left me. I moved up to Michigan after about a year of dating to be with her because she was still in college and i was done with college I was working in EMS as a EMT, well we moved in together at the apartment i was renting and i was paying all the rent and utilities and she was only paying for groceries. At first it was going very good i was working alot and cooking while she went to school and mainly did the laundry and we also had a dog which we would take turns taking him outside. Fast forward to this year and my hours were reduced alot because of budget problems within the agency i was working at, which means me being at the apartment a lot more and so being at the apartment more i started getting depressed and laying around and not doing much i was barely cooking and not taking out the dog as much which i understand is my fault and i should have taken more accountability for my actions and chores around the apartment, and i wasnt myself anymore but even through all of that she stuck around.  Well i have been trying to get out of EMS for a while and want to become an electrician so i was looking all around for apprenticeships and other sorta jobs to bring in more income but i couldnt find anything because we lived in such a small town in MI, so basically i was relying on my dads inheritance he left me after he passed 2 years ago to pay the bills. So now fast forward again to like july of this year when the break up happens. But we left to go to her parents for her summer break and we were going to come to TN to visit my mom for about a week, well we were at her parents and all was going well and having a good time, and we went out to eat and i didnt pay for meal, her parents did. well when we left my ex girlfriends brothers boyfriend paid for his lunch and apparently her dad was mad at me for not paying him for mine, but i didnt know this, well later my brother in law messaged me saying he was in Detroit and wanted to hangout for the day so i went down there and hung out with him. Well when i was down there my ex texted me and told me that her dad was mad at me for not paying and all this, so this started a argument between us and so i left to go TN with out her as this argument was still going on. Well later on this argument got so bad we decided to take a break/break up, and during this time I was at my moms i got a message from my manager saying that they were firing me. So i decided to look for electrician schools all around and found one in TN and applied and got in so im now in electrician school which i start sept.5th. So i Had to go back up to MI to pack up the apartment and get all my stuff well my ex came up to help me pack and we talked it out and got back together, and she plans on living at the apartment and having her parents take over the payments. but after we made up and got back together i drove back to TN and she went back to her parents. Well she told her parents we got back together and her dad was furious and told her if we dont break up again he will take her car away, her school money and her phone and that im a worthless piece of shit and ill never amount to anything and that i wll always be a lazy ass. So she broke up with me again and she told me she still loves me and that she misses me, But she doesnt know if she wants to get back together again and that she wants to work on herself and other stuff. Ant the thing thats messed up is that her brothers BF cheated on him and was on dating apps and they got back together and that dad doesnt seem to care and still lets him come over. And the worst part about this break up is I dont know if we will get back together and i bought her a promise ring and i was going to propose to her next year in Hawaii on the family vacation, and i just cant live with the fact that someone else is going to live my dream life with her, and get to hold her hand and marry her and have kids with her and see her naked and have sex with her like i did. We took each others virginity and i just dont want that to be any other guy then me. it Just sucks, i need help i feel like im drowning in my own thoughts.

"Its fucked man only thing I can think of is her A- hole dad... Best thing I can tell you is to try to be in contact with her... don't let her forget you and when everything sets down and everything returns back to normal you two can be together again. Now its best to try just to stay in contact with her and tell her honestly about your plans with her in the future. You should also focus on electrician school too, don't let that thing slip up.

"I (24 f) think my mother, ""Lola""(45 f) is jealous of the relationship I have with my little sister, ""Annie"" (8). Ever since she was born I've been helping my mother with my sister, changing her diapers, feeding, changing her, washing her, and all of that for eight years now. Of course, at the start my mother was the one that took care of her, but when she needed to start working more when my litter sister was around two. I was staying the one that took over to take care of her- up till now. I've been the one to drop and pick her up for school, helped her with her homework, feed her, make sure she takes a shower- everything. 

I even take care of her when my mother gets back from work, letting her rest and do anything else that she needed. The thing is, is that when my sister is being affectionate with me my mother would automatically start saying that my sister doesn't love her. When ""Annie"" goes to hug our mother and tell her she loves her too. ""Lola"" will push her away, and say no. That she'll find another little girl who will love her, making ""Annie"" cry and her running to me. 

I know my mother loves her and my sister is always asking for my mother, but every time we hug, tell each other we love you, and kiss my mother gets mad. It's gotten to the point where I make sure to not do those things and what confused me more is that ""Lola"" says that when she dies she has the comfort knowing that my sister won't miss her so much because she has me. 

She complains about this kind of stuff all the time. That ""Annie"" doesn't love me and that I'm her mother. I tell her all the time ""Annie"" does love her, but I don't know if she believes it or if she's just joking. It's gotten to the point where I'm getting pissed. 

It happened again today, but this time she grabbed a stuffed animal that I have. Threatening to give to the dog, I grabbed something of hers telling her would do the same. She said she didn't care, so I toss it aside and she threw the stuffed animal- the stuffed animal has a ball inside which ended up hitting me in the eye claiming I hit her head when I didn't. 

She turned away and I ignored her and a few minutes asked me if I wasn't angry. I said I wasn't and she's the one that got mad. 
We went back and forward, and she opened for a hug and said, ""Come here b-word"" 

That sent me back, but I didn't move or respond. She got mad and left, never. Never has she called me the b-word- especially in a tone that made it seem like I was someone she couldn't stand. 

I don't know why she even acts like this or what to say to get her to stop. I don't care what she thinks of me, what I'm most concerned is about my little sister. Every time she says something mean and my sister cries I try to console her and tell her to not believe a single thing our mother says.

"My boyfriend (21M) and I (21F) have been together for almost 7 months now. Not a long time, yes, but I have been friends with him for almost a decade before we got together.

So, in between that long ten years, we knew about each other’s ex-partners and all. I knew about his last ex, of which he had an on-and-off relationship that lasted three years.

The three of us lived on the same village, but luckily we haven’t stumbled upon her since then. Not until now, wherein we found out that a nearby restaurant we were eyeing was his ex’s family business.

I have this lingering insecurity over his ex with regards to financial status. My boyfriend and his ex lives the same fancy lifestyle. Yet me, not so much. They are both from well-off families, with parents earning lots of money. She lives on this fancy and big house, and so I kept on comparing myself to her and I worry a lot about not being able to provide my bf’s wants and maybe his past was able to do those (he said no, i talked about him about it before). My bf says too that he doesn’t love her anymore especially because she cheated on him. He also says that I am so much better than her. But I still am bothered. I genuinely want this to be over since it worsens to the extent that I dream about her and her fancy house. Please help me :(

How do I deal with this? Thank you so much :(


- It’s also a bit hard to forget and not think about it, especially because we pass by the ex’s restaurant often."	otterutters	post	22.202623897024868	female	White	0.005457778926938772	na	na	na	2	offmychest	no prediction.
"sounds like his ex was nearly identical (at least in life style) to himself. is it possible that a lot of your insecurities are why he actually prefers you? money hasn't come easy to you, maybe you have a better core value system than she did/does?

Maybe sit down with BF allowing yourself to be fully emotional and explain where you're at. Since he cares for you he may be able to help verbally reassure you during these feelings."	otterutters	reply	na	na	na	0.005457778926938772	no	strong	strong	na	offmychest	no prediction.

"
Last year my wife (23) passed away due to kidney failure. I remember sitting at her hospital bed playing my guitar for her as she closed her eyes and smiled listening to the soft melody of one of the songs I wrote just for her. Every single chance I got I visited her and brought her flowers and a new pair of fuzzy socks. Every single day I went to see her I told her that I love her and she’s my world and she always smiled and called me loverboy which was the nickname she had given me. One of the times I was walking from the hospital to my car to head home for the night. I opened the door and sat in the drivers seat for a minute. I lost it. I was screaming and crying with anger and sadness at the top of my lungs. I knew I was going to lose my wife soon and the fact that there was nothing I could do to save her made me feel so helpless and angry. I couldn’t believe this was really happening. The next day I went to see her after work and I will NEVER forget the big smile she gave me when she saw me that day, that was the smile of kind, loving, caring, beautiful, funny, happy positive woman in the whole world and it made my heart race to see it. I stayed with her that day until 3 AM. I will never forget my last moments with her, as she held my hand tight, but she was weak it broke my heart and squeezed out her last words “I love you”. I watched as her eyes slowly close shut, and her hand went limp as I was holding it, she had passed right in front of me. At that moment, everything I loved, everything I cared about, everything I had ever wanted was torn from me. My entire world was crumbling. I will never forget how big of a role she played in my life. Please remember to hold on to what you love, every single moment is precious and should be spent with the people you love.

"I am so sorry for your loss. I am glad you could be there in her final moments. That is not easy to do. It is good that you have some good memories of her final days too.

Your message is a good one to appreciate people you love before it is too late. 

I just lost a former partner. The man I had wanted to marry. We broke up a while ago. We stayed friends. At times I know I treated him like he was a pain in the ass. I feel really bad about it. I have been beyond heartbroken since he passed. I wish recent years had played out differently. Had I known he was going to pass away, things might have been different too. 

Things have come to light since he passed. I wish I had known those things years back. I might have understood him better and been more tolerant."	MythrasCrush	reply	na	na	na	0.0050965845584869385	strong	no	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.
I know this probably isn't the right subreddit for this or maybe it is, but last Wednesday my 3-4 month old kitten went outside when I took my dog out. Someone took her from the back alley while she was outside and took her to a last who lives at the hotel down the road (she also has cats) on thrusday she got scared and ran under a taxi car, everyone was yelling at him to not move is car but he didn't listen. He ran over her head and killed her instantly then he drove away. I know she's just a cat but she was my cat and I loved her. I'm heart broken and I hate myself for letting her out even though it was an accident. I should have just gotten her right as she got outside. When I found out she didn't come home that night she was already dead. Her name was mini and I miss her a lot. I blame myself because it's my fault she got out and I hate myself for it. I can't stop crying. And it sucks knowing I was looking for my cat for almost a week and there was never any chance of bringing her home or holding her again.

"i got her when i was two years old, and we have very much grown up together. she was full of character, fiesty and very adventurous, but she had a soft spot for me and i for her. as we grew older we became more and more inseparable she began looking and calling for me all over the house and would meow excitedly when she saw me. over the last few years she began exhibiting clear signs of feline dementia (confusion, distress when not knowing where i am, very sleepy all the time) but she still managed to be a very happy and healthy cat. two months ago she started becoming more lethargic and opted to stay indoors, spending the majority of her time sleeping - which continued up until last friday which took a huge changing point. at this point she was clearly reaching the end of her life, she was very unresponsive- no longer purring or meowing, loss of appetite and very sleepy and floppy. all she did over the weekend was sleep in my arms and stomach small portions of wet food. my parents and i took her to the vet yesterday, very much understanding that this was likely the end of her journey. it was likely a brain tumour that had developed from melanoma in her eye, but we would have had to put her poor little body through so many tests which would cause her a lot of stress. beyond this we were told that she had no chance of improving from her current lethargic state, and the rest of her time (which was likely not going to be for long) would be hospice care. we made the very hard decision to euthanise her, i held her when she took her last breath and she moved closer to me as she died. im at a complete loss at the moment, i feel like a huge part of me has died with her. i recognise that this is grief and something all pet owners experience, it is the price for our love - but i genuinely do not know how im going to continue my life without her, nor do i want to. she was my best friend, my emotional support animal (i have mental health disorders which she greatly helped with), and my whole heart. i dont want to never see or cuddle her again. i look for her around the house and check her favourite spots unconsciously, i think i hear her calling to me, i see photos of her and just break down. 

if anyone could give me any advice on how to cope with such a loss, i know everyone says time will heal but i need things to soothe me now"	mewoarchive	post	34.57199653048332	female	White	0.9961017370223999	na	na	na	4	offmychest	no prediction.

"I got my cat when I was nine, and she passed about 16 years later. When I tell you it felt like someone ripped out a piece of my heart… oh dear God. 

It’s been almost 10 years, and the thought of her and her death (sudden and unexpected) will put me to tears in literal seconds. 

Unfortunately I made the mistake of speaking about her death last week, and briefly cried in public (which I don’t do, and hate doing). In tears now as I respond. 

My point is, I understand the all consuming pain and notion of impossibility that life will move forward without my cat. I remember it felt like this level of intense grief would become my new normal.

If you allow yourself to feel your feelings, and remember the good moments, and recognize your cat knew they were loved, then you will move past this initial stage, and find some peace and happiness again. The pain is always there, but it’s on the back burner. 

I get wanting to be soothed right now, but you got to feel your feeling to get to soothing. It sucks, and it hurts, but it will pass if you allow yourself to experience the full range of emotions. If you don’t allow yourself to grieve now it will come back to haunt you. So pick, when do you want to pay (emotional toll) now or later? Generally, I find paying upfront ends up being not as demanding.

I always loved this quote from Wandavision, “[b]ut what is grief, if not love persevering?” I think the author wrote it in relation to his sister that died. Remember, grief is an expression of love.

"Yesterday, I made a list of all the reasons, I should not be alive. And another list of all the reasons I should continue to live. The first list had 25 bullets. The second list had only 5 - and all of them were related to my daughter A \[12F\]. My daughter is the only reason for me to live; she will be devastated and probably blame herself. 

But I also feel that I messed up her life by divorcing her mother and by being in a dead-end career. 

* My career is a mess, I am highly underconfident, and work for a tech startup.
* I get yelled at by my boss regularly
* Everyday he tells me that he should have had ""walked me out"" long time ago. I will not get any other job. I have been applying for jobs but not getting any calls.
* I have absolutely zero savings and cannot live without a job. 
* Most of my colleagues don't trust me and it feels like I cannot get anything right.
* Three years ago, I found my ex-wife was having an emotional and virtual affair with one of her old classmates. I have never told the actual reason of the divorce to anyone.
* I read her messages to her friends and those were absolutely humiliating about me. They all knew about the affair and her plans to visit the guy.
* I have ADHD as well as depression. Combined with my underconfidence, it makes it extremely hard to outperform in any job.
* My credit score is screwed up because I forgot to pay my car loan on time a few times.
* Many weeks go by without me talking to a single adult.  
* Note that I was not a bad husband and definitely not a bad father. I was never abusive, I am fairly fit, I  was the primary parent ever since A was born. 
* I graduated from one of the top universities in the US with a highly sought after degree. Most of my classmates are in extremely prestigious roles in their organizations. Most of them have happy, loving families and great savings.
* I used to be very funny and energetic before the divorce, which was mainly a coping mechanism for my depression

I need to fix myself and I have absolutely no idea where to start. I don't want to die for at least next 7-10 years. It feels like nothing has gone right in my life for last few years. I don't want to blame others, but focus on fixing myself.

I need a decent career where I am respected, as well as grow. Where I can take a vacation. I need to find time to spend with my daughter. I need to learn new hobbies. And I don't know where to start!

"I am 23F and I have started dating a man who is in his 50's and I love it. It started out as flirting for fun but in the past few weeks I noticed he started showing more and more interest in me. Any time he would see me his face would light up, he would always be super excited to see me and that's when I figured he might actually want to pursue me and not just flirt to pass the time. I deliberately started running into him more often to test the waters and he caught onto it and went along with it. He is opening a bussines of his own so I would come by there to see how it's going but also to see him. We very openly flirted in front of everyone, even his son (who is actually older than me) so that's how I knew he was not married or taken or anything like that. A few days ago we made plans to go for a walk and I thought we were gonna do just that, go for a walk where we live at but he turned it into an actual proper date. We did go for a walk but near a lake in the city and went for drinks. I had wonderful time. He did not force himself onto me, we didn't even kiss that night. After he left me home, he texted to let me know he had a wonderful time as well. We also exchanged numbers then, he did not ask me for my number before. The plan we made to go on a walk was made face to face but we both showed up as we said we were gonna. I feel like we very quickly established a level of trust, especially through that. I usually always double check with people if our plans are still on but with him I just knew there was no need to do so, I knew he would not lie or waste my time. He also started calling me a few times throughout the day to ask how I'm doing or just to hear my voice. 

We went on our second date yesterday. There was a game on that he wanted to watch so we went for a walk again and than to a random caffee bar that had a tv so that he could watch his game. I enjoyed seeing him get really into it and show emotion whilst watching it but he kept apologizing for his strong reactions since he was cursing at times and got super excited when we scored. I found all of it to be very cute to observe, to see him be passionate about something. I told him this as well but to apologize for it, he gave me a kiss. It was very natural, did not feel forced or awkward like first kisses can be. It was right after the first 45 minutes of the game. He said how he's sorry about all the fuss he's making about the game and gave me a cute little kiss. He gave me a few more as the game continued and started getting a bit more touchy but in a sweet way like wrapping his arm around me or stratching my back or playing with my hair. None of it felt overly sexual. Obviously, there is tention between us but none if it feels forced or pressured. After the game we had a bit more of a makeout session before going home but again, nothing too crazy. We both expressed how we are out of practice in that department but came to a conclusion that we can practice together which was very cute. After he left me home, he texted again to say how he had a nice time but how he would actually like to continue our date despite it almost being midnight. At this point I thought maybe he wanted to do it, which I was totally down for, so I agreed and he picked me up again. We went to a secluded place but all we did was talk and kiss for 2 hours. The kisses were very light and sweet and he was not trying to sleep with me, just wanted to cuddle and be affectionate. It was by far the most comfortable I have ever felt with a man. The way he handles me is vastly different than any guy or man did before. He is not the first guy of that age group that I have been intimate with like this but this is the first time it feels natural and just right. We also have very similar personalities, to an extent of course. If we were totally the same, that wouldn't work, at least not for me. 

Also, we have decided that it's better that we keep this under wraps in the area we live at. It's a small conservative village, people are very quick to judge. The thing is thought, a lot of people have heard us talk about wanting to hang out, they saw us meet at a caffee bar for our first walk/date and one of his very close friends knows he likes me because they talked about it and he teases him for it (in good nature) so it's not like we're completely hiding away from the World, we are just being careful about who sees us because we are aware of how dramatic things can get and we also feel like that would add an unnecessary amount of preassure on us.

So yeah, just wanted to get this off my chest. I usually come to reddit when I am struggling with something so it's good to be posting on here about something positive.

EDIT: Please do not write anything if you have nothing positive to say. I am not a home wrecker, he is divorced, has been for over 10 years. I am aware I could be his daughter, no need to point it out. I just wanted to share somewhere how I am happy.

Another edit: The age difference is something I am used to. My dad is 74, my mother is 50.

Edit #3: I am not aiming towards a relationship with him, I am not asking for his money/financial stability, he is, once again, surely not married and I am not a side piece. My mistake was that I used the word ""dating"" in the post but I probably should have written I am seeing him instead. My post was just to gush over the fact that I am experiencing a human connection like I have not before and I am certain I cannot find in men closer to my age.

"Are you the 50 yr old man looking for validation in pursuing a 23 yr old? BC you definitely come off as super defensive.

If not, girl, I don't know what to tell you. You may think you're super mature, worldly etc., which, fine, you might be.

But what does it say about a 50 yr old? Whose son is older than you?

What would a man of that age have in common with a 20 yr old? The generation gap is huge, there's not much at all you can possibly have to bond over as your experiences in life are decades apart. 

Sure, you can say oh we have the same values and other such b.s., but it's extremely sus that a supposedly successful, well to do divorced 50 yr old, is suddenly so into a much, much younger woman. 

If he wants a trophy wife/girlfriend, and you're ok with that, then hey, you do you, there's no need to seek approval from strangers on reddit. 

Because it sure sounds like you have no one to talk to about this IRL, or have tried to, only to be put off by their valid concerns over the age gap.

"I was 19, he was in his early 50s, older than my father. That was many years ago, we have an adult child now. I will say this… now many years later, as the parent of teenagers that I have an open and honest relationship with, they have all expressed that the situation is difficult and uncomfortable for them, thinking about someone within a few years of their age having a baby with a man in a completely different stage of life and with all of the build in power dynamics of two people from entirely different circumstances. I’m not saying that you are planning for something like that to happen, but neither did I. After that I dated 12-20 years older , my physical/emotional preference falls within this range and I’m not ashamed of that. However, there is something to be said about being in similar life stages and gaining important and valuable experiences within those life stages. I think I gravitated to older after that partially because at that point I WAS in a similar life stage- raising kiddos, juggling career and nanny and schools- but I was in my mid 20s then, having skipped the life stages of college, traveling, idyllic wedding, baby shower, continuing childhood friendships because we didn’t relate to life stages anymore.

I know. She knows too. I feel nauseous when I think about the old letches I was with when I was her age. If either of my brothers in their 50s dated a 23 year old I’d be disgusted. But they haven’t and wouldn’t because they’re decent, respectful humans. Same way I couldn’t be with a 23 year old guy in my now 40s.

I know that feels condescending, I thought so, too, when people voiced their concerns about the man who was older than my father took advantage of my trust and naivety. 

There's a reason there is a pattern for men like this. There's a reason so many people are telling you this isn't smart. You have options, people are just trying to show you the options that won't leave you tied to a man who finds barely adult women proper dating prospects.

"You're like a walking meme.

Dating man too old for them.

Says the man makes them feel special and attractive. Clearly, these are things you battle with, and he's taking advantage of that.

The relationship is totally not toxic or inappropriate despite saying 2 things that hint it is, or 1 thing that is glaringly obvious red flag.

He treats you like a secret, but he totally isn't using you as a side piece. He loves you and respects you. Qhich is shy. You're a secret side piece.

I get whatever drew you into a relationship with someone representative of the dregs of dating society is likely loneliness, insecurity in your own worth as a partner, or a bad family/financial background. The signs are there solely in what you've said.

**However, you are not the exception.** By wrote, everyone who thinks the are the exception to age gap dangers is **not the exception.**The biggest danger in age gap relationships isn't the age gap.

Its the younger person not being conscious of common red flags and putting their feelings/attraction over good sense. You are active fawning over him, and I spotted 3 red flags already, bro.

That is why old men date young women. They know money will keep their company, inexperience will have them overlook their flaws/toxicity, and their age and perceived maturity will be used as essy leverage for control.

You are (minimum) 3x more likely to catch an std, and 5x more likely to be cheated on, and 4x more likely to be abused. Im not going to give you links because if you google it yourself, you'll find these yourself, and if you actually care to look, you'll find it, and i won't waste my time.

Whatever void you think he's going to fill inside you, or whatever hurt you are looking away from, is not going to get better by you intentionally putting yourself in situations that can destabilize your life. 

This man can ruin you. Not hurt your feelings, or make you cry. **Ruin you.** Financially, mentally, emotionally. You can end up in a vice where you are trapped before you even realize he's crushing the life out of you, and just by sheer metrics, the likelihood a person who is in their 50s is a well adjusted, good man when he needs to quitely date 20yos while hes most likely still married is a fuckin zero.

Literally, the last thread I was commenting on in the exact same subject, the guy was secretly taking out multiple credit cards in her name and maxing them out. The older you are, the more likely someone on the market is not married or taken for BAD REASONS. It is why most people get married a few years after college age.

If you stay, eventually, you will look back on this thread in shame. Whether it is when he eventually shows you how toxic he is and has no choice but to walk, or when you're 40 changing his diapers."	flamingopickle	reply	na	na	na	0.0011465986026450992	no	no	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.

"So you found out in the last seven days that he wasn’t married and you’re confident in that? What about a long-term girlfriend? You don’t need paperwork for that.

I mean, let’s be realistic, you don’t really know the guy. I’ve had guys lie to me to keep me around who I dated much longer than you’ve been dating this guy. For example, I had an ex who went on and on about how all his exes were cheaters, and how much he hated cheaters, and I believed him because I liked him so much. Guess what he did? Cheated on me. 

So how are you so sure you’re not his first joy ride to stroke his old ego when he likes to keep you a secret? How do you know that he doesn’t have others that he kept a secret? How are you so positive that he doesn’t have a wife or another girlfriend? He can show you divorce papers of his first wife, but why would he show a marriage certificate of another wife? Men who keep you a secret, aren’t doing it because they don’t wanna be judged, he really doesn’t care about that. In fact, old farts like him love to show off the fact they have a young gal on their arm. Sweet summer child, there’s absolutely a reason he’s keeping a secret, and not the one he’s telling you.

And realistically, where is this gonna go?  Do you want to have kids? Cant see him wanting to especially at his age. Are you going to be his caretaker in 20/30 years? Like what’s the endgame here at least on his end? Or does he just see you as exactly the 23 year old naïve girl to have some fun with before moving onto the next younger 20 something who is fun and easy with no long term expectations yet, once you get older and actually start wanting commitment from him? And I’m gonna be honest with you, I’m 31, and I cannot imagine dating somebody younger than 25 at this point. You all look like kids to me, and for heaven sakes, he has a kid older than you. That’s creepy as hell. I mean imagine right now, you have a kid, a fresh baby. Now look at a 30 year old.

"LMAO! I think a more interesting conversation to have with my therapist would be about how random strangers on Reddit think they know enough to comment on my life based off of 3 post on an account I created a few weeks ago to let off some steam! LOL!

But since you guys appear to be experts on all things “red flagy” please feel free to clarify these facts for me and everyone else who upvotes you….

- How do you know I was/am infatuated?
- How do you know how long I was “infatuated”?
- Why is this “obviously not right”?
- What have I done in this relationship to be a red flag?
- How do you know how long the other “fella” was in a relationship the whole time?
- And did I know this already or have I just found out?
- What makes me codependent? 
- What isn’t healthy about this situation?
- What do you know about “what rights I have to talk about” this person?
- How do you know all my posts are about the same thing?
- What happened in this “relationship” and for how long?
- Who was in the wrong? Was anyone in the wrong? 
- Who am I talking about when I say “won”?
- Who do I need to talk to?
- Who do I miss? 
- How many different situations am I getting off my chest in my posts?

Obviously I'm commenting based on assumption, you haven't told us your age 🙄 a doorknob could recognise the sarcasm, it's the unnecessary hostility that's more telling. Maybe you should talk to your therapist about it?

"In many ways i've been quite blessed, and not just in a ""born in a developed country in the 20th century, free from war, disease and famine"" kind of a way (let's face it, for all of the humans born throughout history, most of us are in a very elite and lucky group, all things considered). No, i mean...i've made great friends, had lots of hobbies, and never had problems socialising. But I've always been a little unlucky in love. Or just made some truly poor decisions perhaps? Gone after the wrong people, said the wrong thing at the wrong time... I've never been able to wake up to someone in the morning and feel both happy AND secure...does that make sense? 

I'm 39 now. And honestly, i thought i'd be settled down with a spouse and a kid or two running around causing chaos by now. I really wanted that too.

I've had a few flings here and there, but nothing would stick. I thought i'd met the one a while back and fought for her...fought REALLY FKIN HARD!! But had my heart ripped out a few years ago in a brutal and extended fashion. She moved on with her best friend eventually. 

After i (sort of) recovered from that break up, i figured that i'd stack the chips in my favour. I started working out, started eating healthy, paid attention to how i dressed, and made a conscious effort to present myself better. Less of the ""little stoner skater/biker"" vibe, and more...grown up...confident. And...it worked! I felt great! Better than i'd ever felt in fact! But then...

I had a slight insecurity that i'd had for a couple of years, in a very ""private"" area.
When i was young, i'd been ""cut""...a common procedure in some countries, less so in the UK but still...not all that unusual. One of the common problems with this though is that, especially when done at a young age, the surgeon will remove too much skin. And so, as you grow up, it begins to recruit skin from the surrounding area instead. This can cause a bad case of...er...Sideburns?! And as i'd been getting older, the sideburns were starting to grow in quite badly, and quite far up too.

I'd never had any complaints about these, but i had a suspicion that they probably weren't too comfortable for partners. Frankly, they weren't particularly comfortable for me either! Clippers ""down there"" can be risky (cut myself more than once), there was too much to just tweeze (plus i got more than one ingrown from doing that too, which was irritating as hell!)...so i figured i would do the sensible thing. Stop the home remedies. Go to a well-reputed dermatology clinic and get some advice...

...and this is where the story takes a turn for the worse. Because as it turns out, dermatological lasers can have the potential for some pretty horrific side effects...

It didn't go well. I ended up getting over-treated...the tech zapped everything...places that needed treatment...and places that didn't. Some spots were hit repeatedly. The whole thing got nuked from orbit. 

And my after care was poor too...on my way out of the session i'd actually asked if i should leave it a few days before jumping in a bath, and was told ""take a bath whenever you like, you need to keep it clean!"" so i was in one that night...January, cold flat, panel gap in the bathroom window...yeah, those baths were too hot. Hindsight is 20/20 right?

The inflammatory reaction built up gradually...i'd been told to expect some discomfort, but 3 weeks later with a little fella that was 5 shades browner, and in so much agony that i'd actually collapsed at one point, i'd pushed my embarrassment to one side and called the clinic for help. And i got a call back from the clinic 5 minutes later...""it's got nothing to do with your treatment, contact your GP."" I was on my own.

I spent 24 hours sitting in A&E, alone and scared, waiting to be seen. During that time, the ache has spead to my balls.

The doc was at a loss. Tells me i'll be sore for ""6 months at least."" Sends me out of there with antibiotics and nothing else. ""Wait for a call from urology."" Deep down i know i'm screwed.

Days turned to weeks. I sat at home distraught, unsure what to say to friends, family, co-workers...what was supposed to be a minor and deeply personal treatment is about to become everyone's business, and i know it. When my antibiotics ran out i contacted my gp surgery for more advice. My skin wasn't just darker, it was changing, parts of it had actually solidified by this point. I could barely walk, and nocturnal erections were so painful they actually woke me up.

Explaining all this to the doctor over the telephone, i asked him what he would advise? He laughed.

""I advise that you don't let a laser near your penis!"" Amazing.

I brokedown. I hung up the phone. I stared out my window all day, tears streaming down my face, wondering how the f@ck this happened.

Urology booked me in 3 weeks later. And the urologist wasn't exactly sympathetic. One of the worst appointments i've ever had in my life tbh. I coukd practically hear her ""tut tutting"" at me, thinking i'd got treated because i thought of myself as a wannabe porn star or something. She sent me out of there with awful advice and a prescription for more of the same antibiotics that hadn't done anything last time (and knowing full well that i didn't have an infection).

And that's as far as i got with the NHS. I've been booking myself private appointments instead...appointments i can't really afford...dermatologists suggest urology consultations, who just refer me back to dermatologists. It's a game of medical specialist ping-pong.
I'm in charge of my own treatments. I suggest something to my GP...and she prescribes it. Maybe i'll ask for barbituates next time?!

Actually, i'm probably not joking about that last part. This is what i'm trying to get off my chest (for anyone who has suffered through this far)...honestly, i think i'm done.

My days this year have been spent online, google and reddit mainly. At first i was trying to figure out what happened. Then...ways to try and fix it. Moisturisers, steroids, anti inflammatories. Then...coping strategies. I'm 8 months in...my time is mainly spent looking at exit plans now. Which is horrible and selfish i know, but...what else can be done?

I'm pretty sure any dream of a spouse and kids have gone up in a laser-induced puff of smoke. I'm pretty sure i'll be losing my job soon too. I can't blame them either, they've been brilliant, they really have. But i'm not really doing anything... i can barely even summon the energy to keep my flat clean now. Barely summon the motivation to keep myself clean. To get out of bed in the morning.

I'm scared. But i'm not scared of death anymore. The process maybe, but not the end result, not really. Not now. No...now I'm scared of living...existing like this for another 3, or 4, or even 5 decades. That's what terrifies me. I don't think i can. I'm not strong enough.

I'm sorry. To anyone that i've hurt, or anyone that i may end up hurting. I didn't intend to. I wish things were different. But i fear some things simply can't be fixed.

So if i do just snap soon...if i decide that enough is enough...i'll leave this post here. It's an explanation, a confession and an apology. I never imagined things would turn out like this. I'm sorry."	mattyo360	post	27.71989558879057	female	White	0.0158837977796793	na	na	na	0	offmychest	failed
Hi I’m a 22 (F) and my boyfriend is 27 (M). To give just a quick run down of my story, we started dating early 2020 of February and let’s be honest we’ve had ups and downs just like any other relationship would. We’ve both done wrong and made mistakes. I was young and I truly didn’t understand what it took to build a real relationship being that I was only 19 and it was my first real relationship out of high school and I still had all these insecurities about myself and then learning things from his previous relationships and the things he did to the previous girls and who he was and I quote “was” which I know now was wrong and maybe caused all this to happen in the first place. I Loved him the way I knew how and did what I could for about 2 years till things ended because I guess I didn’t do enough and I wasn’t present fully and he decided to cheat on me……..which threw me off heavy. He ended up ghosting me for about 4 months after I found out and came back and wanted to fix things. It took me a while to let it happen because I was hurt and scared and I was in the process of learning myself and picking the pieces up but I gave it a chance anyway because I loved him. We dated for almost a year again and I ended up leaving to work on myself because I was toxic to myself and him being I was even more insecure and not very trusting of him and his words. He said he understood and he stuck around and reassured me he was there even though I was taking time. Because I was trying to get rid of all the insecurities I built, it meant it was all gonna come out after being surpressed for so long and it definitely did because I was still questioning him on if he had someone etc. Now fast forward to present day he officially ended it on my birthday and said that I’m “toxic and not good for him anymore and that we should’ve seen it before” and now I’m so unsure how to feel because here I am spending all this time working on myself to be a better woman and putting the work in to fix my relationship I had and now it’s over. Here I am again back at square one where I’m ghosted for his mental health and his healing which I understand but now I can’t stop thinking about him even though I know I need too and that I need to move on but I don’t know where to start cause this was supposed to be my person and I can’t seem to walk away……..I don’t know but I can’t feel a thing. I’m numb and angry at the world because I didn’t think I could be so destructive.	Lydiaaaa13	post	21.81231349128974	female	White	0.9982072114944458	na	na	na	1	offmychest	failed

"I don't ever want to talk to anyone about my problems again. I hate doing it so much. I know it's bad for me to bottle things up, but I don't have a choice. I can't handle being that vulnerable, and I can't cope with knowing I'm making someone else feel bad or worried about me. I hate it when people know my personal shit, so I'm just going to hold it all in until it kills me.

"i Think my ex and i just broke off an amazing five year relationship. 

i say i think because she never explicitly said she wanted to break up, she just said that our relationship isn’t healthy and we should work on ourselves. i guess thats the modern way of a gentle break up but i honestly don’t know. 

I come from a LOT of family trauma, and i am really really bad at communicating, especially emotions. so when i tell you i dont know what something means, i am literally being so serious.

The reason for the split : i put my hands on her for the first time recently, ever in our 4 years. It happened like this …

About 7 months ago, we were in my parents house hanging out. My ex and i used to be around each other DAILY, and this day i spent house sitting for my abusive dad (🤦‍♂️).

Me and my girl were in the basement, and a disagreement in conversation came up. Looking back on it now, i can’t even remember exactly how the argument started which means the reason was too small to even fight over… But like most couples we disagreed anyways. 

Most of the time when we argue, we can come to a quick resolution, which is how we lasted so long. But this night, there wasn’t any of that. We were bickering back and forth. I do not like that, so my defense mechanism is to run from the problem. I like to create space, and give myself time to think so that i dont become overwhelmed (fighting w my ex reminded me of my parents non stop fighting- HUGE, OVERWHELMING TRIGGER!).

Most of the time my girlfriend respects the space i need, which is why i love her even now. but she was raised completely different - her first instinct is to find the root of the problem NOW and fix it. i am the opposite- i ran from any arguments and would want to be by myself. This night of our fight, the two thought process were immiscible. 

After our initial verbal disagreement , i went across the room and was silently scrolling on my phone. at this point, i am shutting down and trying to create space. She is still arguing her point, and is visibly upset by me being on my phone. I explained that i needed to be in my head for a while, not even leaving the room like how i usually do.

she then proceeded to snatch my phone out of my hand, and set it on the couch. my initial response was anger, but i know myself. i camly picked my phone back up and asked her not to do that. she then snatches my phone again and throws it across the room.

i really my tried my best to stay calm. without a word, i get up and retrieve my phone. she is still sternly talking in my face the whole time. I went on my phone again, trying to disassociate. She throws my phone a third time and the anger i had building up finally lashed out. i put my hands firmly around her neck and said “LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE DAMMIT. WHAT DONT YOU UNDERSTAND!?” 

I immediately realized what i did and apologized profusely. That moment rightfully scared her, she was afraid it would escalate if we disagree again, and i guess she was right because it would happen again. We spend a day or two apart, and we reconcile.

Fast forward to today. We are both once again in stressful life situations. Our arguments got a little louder, but the love was still there. Or so i thought, until i discovered her texting another man. Hes a coworker of hers, and the things they text to each other AT 11 PM… They were exploring each others minds. The sweet things she would say to him while giving me the not so sweet her…  it broke me. 

one day we had a disagreement, and the coworker came up as the reason for the disagreement. I was incredibly upset and angry, so once again i try to create space. I leave the house. She follows me outside, and the disagreement continues. Heres where i went wrong: i just fucking snapped. i had no control over my emotions. I pulled her hair hard, and pinned her against a wooden fence as i tell her everything wrong with her . She is genuinely telling me that they are just friends, and she can prove it. 

Believe it or not the story gets worse. its almost over, please stick with me. Immediately after this first altercation, we go back inside to look at the texts between her and her coworker. as i am trying to explain to her that this is soft cheating, she keeps speaking over me. In my manic state, I tried telling her to be quiet and let me speak. In her emotional state, she literally couldn’t stop crying and explaining herself. And this was the fatal trigger. In my mind, I had to make her stop speaking because I had a lot to talk about. And I grabbed the nearest pillow and put it over her face. I said to her “SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP!!!” and removed the pillow. she had a small cut on her bottom lip, the only scars from our entire relationship. I never even given her a bruise but i see now you just have to fuck up once.

I know I need help, but I also feel as though she has a lot to work on too. She has laid hands on me first and before. Not that it makes it any better. She is now rightfully, afraid for her well-being in my presence.

what can I work on? What can she work on? We had a really good history size for the last year. Do you think we could make this work in the future? I cannot see myself with any other woman.

"I haven't really felt ""this"" until it was time for school again after the pandemic.  I'm afraid. I'm scared of being alone while there are dozens of people in my school/class hanging out with their friends. I think they'll judge me for not having friends. Judge me for not being fun to be with, which I guess is kinda true. I don't really talk with people I'm not close with.

I wasn't like this. I remember I had lots of people to hang out with when it was still pre pandemic. I wish I would get my old self back. The old self who doesn't think of what people think. I wish I can make nice friends. 

 My brother is even teasing me about not having friends, which kinda hits straight to my heart, because while I do have friends (only four since I feel like I can annoy them), we don't really hang out. And I feel like I'm always left out in that group of friends. I remember when one day, the teacher announced a group project which should consist of seven members, they all planned without me. They joined the ""cool"" kids' group. I felt so left out at that time. They forgot me to include me. I tried to not show I was hurt, so I just smiled and joked at them, ""Oh man, why didn't you guys include me?"" 
Anyway, I think they felt sorry for me, because when another group project, which should consist of five members, was announced, they all asked me to join them, which I happily agreed to.



That was last school year. Now, I'm facing a big battle inside me. 

Tomorrow, I have to enrol so that I can move up and finally be on fourth year this school year. I wished I had someone to go with me. That's why I asked my friend to go enrol together, which she agreed. She said her mom's gonna be accompanying her. But tonight, I asked her what time we will be going, and she replied with a kind of... i don't know how to explain it, but I feel like she's not going tomorrow with me. She said it was up to her mom, because her mom wasn't sure yet. I kind of expected this from her. She's not really... reliable? I don't know. I think I'm mean for saying that to her.

 So I guess I'll be going alone tomorrow. I just wish my old classmates wouldn't go the same time as I would so they won't see me I'm alone. 

I have those other four friends, but their parents already enrolled them so they don't need to go."	inthebluemoonlight	post	13.470158369456417	female	White	0.9970982074737549	na	na	na	1	offmychest	no prediction.

Over the past year, I have grown apart from my friends and I dont speak to my current ones often at all. I am relatively introverted so it doesn't hugely affect me, but sometimes I have wished I had someone to talk to about....anything.

I am sat there drawing, my cat, sat next to me watching me, seemingly quite interested (probably more interested in the ink pen, but still lol) and I stop drawing and look at her.

"TLDR: I'm insecure about my body count because it's 3 and I'm only 19. I feel like I was ""being easy"" but at the time I was just young curious and stupid and didn't think it would have an effect on me today. I'm so ashamed of myself.

I (19F) have been in 3 intimate relationships so far. My first sexual encounter was when I was 15 with a guy who I didn't even like. The relationship wasn't healthy or long at all, so I don't know why either of us thought it was a good idea. It didn't feel good and I was doing it because I was curious and stupid.

From 16 to 17 I was with another guy who I really loved, but he ended up being emotionally absent so I wasn't being treated correctly. The sex didn't feel like sex, it just felt like he was using me to finish, and then he would either give me head or rub me off so I could finish, like some sort of business exchange. My mental health was suffering too so I thought everything was either normal or if anything bad happened he would blame it on me. He also sexually assaulted me once.

My last relationship from 17 to 18 was perfect. The guy treated me very nicely and loved me very much. Whenever we had sex it was really nice, but it rarely happened. I think I suffer from some sort of trauma from the previous guy, because it hurt too much to have sex after him even if I was turned on.

I sometimes hear people talking about how you have lower value if your body count is high. Mine is 3 and I'm only 19, but the first two guys were just horrible and I honestly wouldn't even want to count that as having sex, it was just fucking and using and stupid decisions. Why would someone not deserve true love just because they've slept with more people? Am I really ""easy""? I didn't think I was at the time, I was just curious.

"Your bodycpunt isn't high by any definition of the word. There's nothing *wrong* with having sexual partners or even a high body count. It's all up to YOU and your preferences for how you handle your body. There is no shame in it unless you allow there to be. Your value is NOT tied to your bodycount, and any person, especially a romantic interest who says it is, is not worth your time.

You made a couple of stupid decisions, but unlike others you realised super early unlike many others who take their count 5-10x yours or even more.

If it makes you feel better I managed that in a week during my divorce, that's perhaps something to not be proud of but it really does not define who we are, anyone judges you negatively for that they're living in a warped sense of reality. I think 3 at 19 makes you sound like a perfectly normal young lady who clearly isn't into casual hookups, my assumption at such a relatively low number would be that you've had a few high school/college/University boyfriends. Double figures is not uncommon and people have their reasons however many they are at so do not be judging yourself harshly for this, there is nothing bad about it. There are men out there who'll try to make you feel contaminated for just having slept with one guy before them, they're just weirdos, people who focus on numbers in general are weirdos, the important thing going forward is that you value and respect yourself and don't accept anything less from anyone else.	buntywoo	reply	na	na	na	0.9952374696731567	no	strong	no	na	offmychest	failed

Neither of us think we’ve slept with many people, in fact, quite the opposite. In the western world people have relationships in high school onwards, they obviously end up sleeping together, it’s normal

Im 16, and i have done some pretty terrible shit in the past, i sought help from my parents and people around me, made amends for whom i can, suffered the consequences, and then started self improvement to become a better person (why i disclaimed this is that this ties into my recent guilt) until recently, 2 days ago i was edging for a bit then decided to go onto Youtube to look for amateur porn since i was tired of the professional stuff (i have a foot fetish), after edging to multiple videos over time i saw this channel, an average youtube “family” channel filled with 24 hour challenge videos etc yk, some of which were challenges involving feet, i already felt like i knew it was wrong to watch those videos, so i looked over the rest of their videos and they had other weird stuff unrelated to feet (not sure if its watched for a sexual intent) mixed with “normal” stuff,  and the channel had a disclaimer that their content is parent monitored, but i still had a feeling it was wrong but the temptation is strong enough that i gave  in and watched the videos anyway, the videos had feet in the thumbnails and the videos themselves had foot massages as a part of the video, however the videos (nor the acts in the videos) arent of a sexual nature, and the person i was aroused at was a girl a year younger than me, but a kid was involved in the videos too,  i watched them and finished to them, then after that i analyzed the channel to see how the kids are hurt and scrolled down the channel back to its first video, and started checking on the channel a few times, then a day later i edged again (to my normal fantasies, nothing related to this), then stopped and after a bit i decide to look at the channel again and look at the comments of a few videos, one of which was one of the feet videos, the feet video had a sexual (to me, i know what foot fetishists find arousing) comment that is obviously from a creep, it was liked by the channel (every comment was liked), and then after I wrote a comment on their newest video informing them of creeps on their channel and what they want (so that i can at least inform them whats actually going on and help them out), then right after that i had the urge to mastrubate to the thumbnails and my horny logic was that technically if i dont give them views, i would have never contributed to the anyone being hurt (and i thought that the problem with CP is that if you watch it, the problem is you are contributing to their abuse financially and through views etc) and so i looked at the thumbnails without clicking the videos and wanked a little, then it went further and i clicked on the videos although i never actually played it so that they wouldnt add a view (watching a video for under 30 seconds doesnt count as a view), i just skipped to certain timestamps to look at certain frames of the videos, shortly right before finishing I remembered ads exist and i watched them just before while wanking, so i already gave them revenue, then i finished and then after that i did more analysis on the channel, looking at the comments on their videos including their first feet video, which had a mix of kids and creeps, the creeps are putting obvious sexual and predatory comments having sexual themes, and suggesting the channel to create more content which has the 15yo girl doing certain thing with her feet, the channel is oblivious to the comments’ sexual nature and intent, they reply innocently to the creeps, it is basically fetish mining, child exploitation, and grooming, just technically legal, i reported the videos themselves and all the comments from creeps to Youtube, and after that i kept checking the channel every few hours to see if theres something good coming out of my comment etc (i wouldnt trust a fucking youtube family for good parenting but still im hoping for some good impact at least), and today i checked again and decided to go on the desktop website version of youtube to report the whole channel, im currently thinking about donating money to a anti child sexual abuse organization, i havent gone through it yet but im thinking about it, i want to at least put out some good into this world especially after what i have done, i should have never done this, i already had an idea before of what was going on about those videos and i still wanked to it, i already had an idea about the exploitation and i still wanked to it, especially the second time i already had an idea of what was going on and i thought about a loophole just so i can get my fucking dick wet, I contributed to fucking child exploitation, I contributed to a child getting manipulated into making sexual fetish content for perverts, i knew it was happening, and i still placed my fucking horniness over morals and the life of the kids, this is no different from CP, poor kids getting manipulated into making fetish content and i still wanked to it despite knowing the shit that was happening, I FUCKING KNEW IT WAS WRONG AND I STILL MASTRUBATED TO IT. Im not sure what to do with my life after this, i went back on my self improvement and lessons learned in one of the worst ways, I betrayed my former self by doing this, my promise to be a better person, i betrayed and broke it, should i turn myself in? Therapy is needed but i cant get my parents to take me to therapy for any reason (they think therapy is a waste of money) much less fucking consuming what is essentially CP, and even if i went there, id would probably get reported and go to prison, im also considering nofap but i doubt it will help me in that regard, im not sure what to do and how to ever live with myself after doing something vile like this.

I apologize for the very long post above i just dont have anywhere else to post all this in, i cant post it anywhere else or tell it to anyone else for obvious reasons.

TL;DR i disregarded my morals and someone’s exploitation to satisfy my own horniness, I am Dan Schneider 2.0"	Throawayyyy2234	post	28.876514912780237	male	White	0.009999074973165989	na	na	na	9	offmychest	no prediction.

"My uncle is a millionaire and lives very lavish life. I am very close with them and see them a few times a week. I texted them in a group chat sending a link to my literal dream home. It is my parents neighbors and they are getting elderly and my dad had a massive heart attack recently and needs more help. If I sold my current home I would be able to buy the house outright and then get a FHA 203k rehab loan for the repairs. I’ve already been preapproved by my lender. I have this house, the information for the land assessment and the trust for the family since it’s been abandoned. I spoke with my rea estate attorney and he gave me the number for the direct realtor involved and I was meeting this Saturday to get it. This would change my families life. My mom and dad watch my son everyday for about an hour and this would make our life so much easier! I would even have to work I could just take care of my family and my parents. 


Then a gut blow, my aunt told me my uncle is 100% buying it. He is going to outbid me on Saturday. She said good luck but he’s getting it.

"Honestly, a lot of people end up in careers that aren't really related to their degree. That's not to say your experience was a waste. College is a great place to learn to study, prioritize, and work in groups. You may or may not end up working in international business. But I'm sure you learned some skills that will be useful in other types of jobs. I went to college for Environmental Engineering and then got a master's degree in Geology. I don't really do either of those things now. But the degrees look good when my company is including my background in a proposal for a contract.


What I'm trying to say is that even if you don't get a job in that specific field, you have not ruined you life. And if you realize later that there's something else you would really love to do, you could go back to school for another degree.

"Hello fellow Reddit Users  


With the given title it should look pretty simple but sadly nothing in Life is simple.So I (M23) met , we will call her Sarah (F27) through the Internet about 1,5 years ago.We have frequent contact via calls or text. In the first few month she got into an long Distant Relationship that Sarah ended about 2 weeks ago.  (during the time their Relationship Sarah's Partner slowly lost her with his actions and comments + after the end of Relationship he emotionally played with her)   
I have supported Sarah all the time and reassured her if she needed it.  


The Thing is ,before and during her LDR I did not had any feelings towards Sarah that were more that just good friends and told her often times that i don't feel romantic Interest towards her.   
But after Sarah gained the courage to end the LDR I noticed I want to spend more Time with her and Im not quite sure that I won't get romantically interested in her.  
In a recent conversation I told Sarah that I'm not that confident anymore that I won't get romantically interested in her.In my perspective she is perfect. From her appearance, her character, the way how she give me comfort while texting or calling, I don't carry the conversations alone .  
I once told Sarah that I like it when she texts first too, that I need more reassurance that I didn't do anything wrong or a simple text that she is busy and Sarah actually listend and is doing it every now and then. We also got in to the habit to send our Shiftplans to each other so the other knows when we are at work.  
She don't really like taking pictures of herself but sometimes she does it for me since I like it.  


TL;DR She basically puts the same energy as myself into the conversations and I in my eyes Sarah is perfect.  
I don't want to ruin the Friendship if it turns out that I really love her and I couldn't continue the Friendship if she is irritated by that.  
Any advice here?  
PS: Im pretty bad in getting Hints..

"I'm (23M) going to start this off by saying that I know I'm coming from a place of privilege by being gay when it is the most acceptable time to be gay in history. The lives that gay people have had to live to get to this point are unfair and I am so grateful to each of them. I'm making this post to vent about my experience, and I (obviously) do not and will never condone any form of homophobia. Anyways, this might not be very organized. Sorry.

I'm a very lucky person. I have many friends who are all incredible people. They're loyal, intelligent, funny, and unique, and I'm really grateful to have them in my life. However, I hold some bitterness towards my sexuality from watching how easy it is for each of them to find partners. They don't have to go to straight-specific events in the hopes of finding someone, because life is a straight-specific event. They can walk up to people and flirt with them because they almost certainly will also be straight. When they find someone that they're compatible with and attracted to, there's only a very rare chance that a massive biological wall, that has nothing to do with them as people, blocks a connection from forming. I can't and will never know what that's like.

Internalized homophobia is real, and I probably have some. But, I love gay culture and the things that it's created. I love creative artists who push boundaries, I love going to drag shows, and I have some gay friends myself. I was even a part of a large gay friend group, but I eventually had to leave because of how they'd treat me. It was one of the hardest decisions I've made. When I was excited about something, they'd make fun of me, and they often took any opportunity to make a jabbing comment in the name of being funny, even after I told them how it made me feel. Call me sensitive, but it got hateful, and I never have had that experience with my other friend groups. I'm happier now that I've left.

When I go out to clubs, I get groped. When I try and go on dates, they want to have sex immediately instead of just trying to be friends first and form a connection. I feel like there is so much vapidness and shallowness in this community and few people have hobbies or interests that aren't directly related to their sexuality. It becomes their personality. I'm so exhausted of being proven right by the gay people that I meet. Having your sexuality be a defining element of your personality is so fucking boring to me, and while it definitely exists in straight people, it just feels so much more prevelant in gay people. That being said, I do still have a couple of gay friends who I love, and I'm grateful for them.

I have many hobbies and I meet a lot of people as a result. I ski, I do trivia every week with friends, I play tennis every week, I go camping, I love board games and have gone to tournaments, I work out often, I go on a solo trip every year to explore the world and travel a bunch otherwise, and I legitimately can get excited about anything. I meet a gay person maybe once a month this way, and that's not even considering that we're compatible romantically or even platonically. This just would not be the case if I were straight. The chances of me finding someone that I'm attracted to, am compatible with, and also happens to be the same sexuality as me feels astronomical. I use dating apps, and I get a decent amount of attention, but from the dates I've been on and conversations that I've had, I haven't found anyone that I've been attracted to emotionally.

I have a good life and am grateful for it. But fuck, I'm so tired of being held back by something I didn't even choose. I have such a strong desire to be in love with someone that loves me back. I want to be inspired by the way they see life, to experience the world with them, to laugh and cry and vent and just be human intimately with someone else. It feels like a fantasy. And as much as I love my closest friends, they will never understand what it's like."	qwyvern	post	23.665725101083034	male	White	0.9587048292160034	na	na	na	2	offmychest	ethnicity: no prediction, age: 23, gender: male, explanation: the author self-identifies as a 23 years old man. there are no conclusive details about the author's ethnicity.
"I hate being woman.

My best friend is also lives far away… I only had a boyfriend once in high school and and i havent even had my first kiss yet… maybe i'll never have a boyfriend and I don't want to get married because the men around me are sexist and very religious plus there is no man around me that I find attractive etc…so our situations are so different but i really understand you 😔 it's so scary to feel lonely and hopeless. my sexual pereference is acceptable but unfortunately that's not the key to happiness either…I don't know what to say to console you but  I understand how you feel very deeply.

"I understand, we are lucky to be in a good time period for being gay but it doesn't make it easier. It's something we can't control and it somehow makes us feel bad since we are constantly seeing things that make us feel ist wrong, even if we get through life only seeing one bad thing about us we feel it for a long time. Some people just want to us each other for sex and don't want to have a real relationship, which makes dating harder as we try to navigate our identity.

However it's something we can protect ourselves from, like you I sometimes feel like it's wrong due to people around me teasing me about things that I don't want th to, but that isn't fair. We shouldn't feel like we have to hide or feel bad for who we are, we are human above all and we have the right to love and express ourselves anyway we please. I still sometimes feel like shit about my sexuality but deep we need to remind ourselves that we can still do so much in this world and that the more people try to pull us down the stronger we need to be. People won't stop being the way they are and it will hurt us, but we need to stay strong enough in order to get by together. 

I hope this help a little, I'm still trying to figure things out but I hope you find a sense of security in your life to help you. (Ps. Sorry if I misspelled anything english isn't my native language)"	qwyvern	reply	na	na	na	0.9587048292160034	weak	no	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.
"i (17f) cheated on my (18m) boyfriend. we've been together for a little over a year. however, our relationship has honestly been kind of a joke. one of love languages is receiving gifts and my bf knows, however the only gift i've received has been a $10 bouquet on our 1 yr anniversary. we didn't even hang out on our anniversary. this past school year we didn't ever talk to eachother at school or go to lunch together. he never even came and watched my volleyball games. this all caused me to feel embarassed for my relationship and just really low in general. 

now, my social standing is probably higher then my bfs, but i'm busy (i work 2 jobs, do vb year round and take multiple college courses) and my bf works one job and the rest of his free time he spends hanging out with his friends. on the weekends, i'm typically busy and he's at work then he is out every night hanging out with his friends. the day we'd hangout was saturdays but even then sometimes that wouldn't happen because something would come up with his friends. i've always felt like a second option. there's also been rumors of him cheating on me, texting other girls, asking other girls for nudes, and sometimes he won't respond to me for 1-2 hrs at night and say his phone was dead or he lost service. of course i don't know any of this for sure but i've always been a little insecure and in all my other relationships i've been cheated on so i'm extremely irritable with stuff like this.

i know that my actions weren't right. and i know that if he found out he'd be upset, but i don't regret what i did. i was texting other guys on my phone, and i was hanging out with 2 other guys behind my bfs back. i made out and cuddled with one and the other we just hung out alone. i only did it because i was craving attention. he still doesn't know what i did and i have been thinking about breaking up with him soon anyways. and for those wondering, why don't you just be over with him, but he love bombs me every now and then which makes me feel guilty and it makes me feel like it was just a rough patch but then i realize that he does this on a repetitive cycle."

"Since 2021, I’ve been going to this place for there’s for my Anxiety, Autism, ADHD, Deppression, and C-PTSD.

It was great to finally get the help I needed after a few years of not getting therapy since I moved twice in that period. Then last spring I couldn’t take my severe adhd causing me to lose important doctors appointments, and I was no longer pregnant, so I figured I should see the office’s psychiatrist while I was at it. 

So I was put on stimulants for my adhd, they started prescribing my lexapro instead of my primary care doctor, and on top of that they started adding welbutrin to the mix which has been AMAZING.

Now, there have been a few cases where I forgot my appointments due to my poor memory, and because this office isn’t on MyChart which is how I remember other appointments from other doctors. For the most part though, my psychiatrist has been extremely disorganized. Last week I called and asked when my next appointment was since I forgot. They told me it was the tenth at 11 am. I waited a bit, nothing. So I called, and they said I didn’t even have an appointment with my psychiatrist. Okay, so I rescheduled for later that day, since I was running out of my lexapro. It was at 2:30pm. Now I go to work at 3-8pm, so if I miss it then I have to wait until at least the next day. Btw I’m only doing telehealth appointments.

The time comes for my bf to drive me to work, and they still don’t call. So eventually I clock into work and have given up, as my psych has been late by **THIRTY** minutes.

After my shift ends I check my phone to see if my psychiatrist had finally sent the link for my telehealth appointment. Yes.


**AT 4:55 PM!** 

And I’m beyond infuriated. I had taken the last of my lexapro the day before. So I rescheduled for the next day at 1:30pm.

**SAME DAMN THING AGAIN**, after a few hours was when I got the text but I was yet again at work. 

I call the office and tell them I need to reschedule and I have to work, between 3-8pm so I need something earlier. So they schedule me today at 1. So it’s only been 15 minutes in my time zone, but I have a feeling it’s going to repeat.


Also, my depression is SEVERE. I nearly lost my cat last week, and I work in a highly stressful job taking care of animals that can die, so I can’t afford to be stressed.

And my depression is bad, I’m constantly crying, my head is getting the worst headaches, and to top it off I just ran out of adderall which I need to work. I’m panicking and these useless people could give LESS OF A SHIT. Not to mention this has been a week of no lexapro, my brain chemistry feels like it’s being changed permanently. And this week isn’t the first time this has happened.

And lastly, I’m on Medicaid. Almost no psychiatrist takes Medicaid near me, and the ones who do either use bs holistic approaches, or live too far away. I live in an area where people seem to deny science and medicine. 

I hate this BULLSHIT.

Discusses SA DV


My abuse rapist, who told me that I needed to agree to sleep with him or he would give my personal information to inmates, we worked at a prison together and that he would lie to the supervisors that another supervisor who had molested me (he tried to sleep with me at work and I reported it but the supervisors ignored me)
He was able to get me to agree to sleep with him, rape and blackmail... It was horrible...

Well we went to the Salt Grass steak restaurant, my mom and I, and he and his family was there... I wanted to make a scene, but I was also scared, he has held a gun to my head twice, and when I reported it the cops were investigating him for DV and he was on administrative leave from the prison for raping someone else...  But I was only able to get an order of protection, and be told that the police would not be involved as his mother died when he was 15, 18 years ago, and he has had it ruff...

I just looked at him took a breath and walked away...

I wish I could have have caused a scene, yelled and told his family that he was a rapist and his sister that he lies about her being a hotdog down a hallway who he takes care of... He lives with his grandmother and lies to everyone. But I knew it wouldn't do anything good.

I wish karma existed, because he definitely deserves to have his life destroyed and his flesh peeled off, but karma will only cause his 8 year old to be raped because that is how karma actually works... I'm so afraid for his family, but I can't say anything or my order of protection will be used against me.... 

Matthew, if I could talk to you or do anything without legal repercussions I would kick you so hard that you could never have sex ever again."	aoayame	post	28.29927658563198	male	White	0.9981265664100647	na	na	na	6	offmychest	failed

"I'm an adopted adult and my parents both passed in the last few years. 
Now it seems like the rest of my small family (sisters and their kids) are cutting me out of their lives. 

I don't get returned calls or texts, they forget the things they say they will do when it comes to me. I find out my niece came into town to see family, but not me. 

I feel like I'm going crazy,  I never thought they didn't care about me or consider me family. Until now. I always considered them my family, I've never known another! 

Now I'm wondering if they included me just to please our parents. I feel like they hate me and I don't know why. 

I admit, I'm probably the family loser. I had a bad accident and head injury years ago and haven't been able to work since. I lost my husband and haven't found another, which I know they frown on. 

I try to not burden them with my issues and needs and rarely ever ask for help. Like years in between needing them to do anything for me. When they have I've always been grateful. 

I don't know what I've done or haven't done for them to do this. I'm sure if I confronted them directly they'd deny it but then they'd continue to cut me out of plans and continue to ignore me.

"I'm so sorry you're going through this. I can't even imagine how lonely you might feel. My suggestion is honestly to not reach out to them if they're being this way, if they don't include you in anything anymore, nor make effort to see you or return messages and calls.

Like, be nice if they do reach out and, idk, maybe still wish them happy birthdays and holidays, because there could be some other reason why they're distant that has nothing to you. If it's something else, they'll make effort to reconnect. But if they don't and if they don't return the happy holiday/birthday wishes, then stop doing that as well and just move on. 

I know it's painful and lonely, but you deserve family that is caring, checks up on you and includes you in family stuff. You're not bothering your family with anything and you're not asking for too much by wanting to be included. 

If possible, try to build support system somewhere else (some community, or support group, or maybe through some hobbies, depending on what you're physically able to do). Meet some people and make friends. Are you able to take care of a pet? Having a dog or some other pet around can help enormously (saying this from experience, I've got a cat that's my sunshine and helps me push through difficult days).

And most importantly, be kind to yourself and make sure to take care of yourself. I'm so sorry you're being treated this way by people you considered family, especially after suffering from an accident and losing your husband."

"At the end of my first week on a job I relocated for, I was diagnosed with Covid after getting a sore throat and fever four days into my training *I work from 2:45-11:15 pm, Wed-Sun. I still have one more week of training. I went to the ER yesterday where they took a Covid test. I got a call at 5 am from my doctor confirming I have Covid.

 This is the first time in my life I've ever truly been sick, and think maybe someone at work might have given it to me. Before confirming it was Covid, the doctor wrote me up a 3 day doctor's note to give to my work. This will be my last week of training as my trainer will be leaving on the 25th and there isn't anyone who can take her place.

 Because I just tested positive, I know there's very little chance I'll be able to go back this Saturday, August 18. The company has a two week quarantine policy until you test negative. 

I'm nervous that me calling in and taking that much time off, having been there for only one week and still in training, will jeopardize my position and reliability.

 I was very excited for this job as it was offered to me, and I get to work with classmates I graduated with but I feel like with all the obstacles in my way, it just might not be the right one."

I give up on life for a variety of reason but the motivating reason is that I am lonely. I feel ostracized and rejected by everyone. I have no friends, I feel like my family could care less about whether I am alive or not, and my depressed mood is not something my partner should experience.

There is nothing I have to live for anymore. I give up.

"My Life Part 3

I found this on mu Facebook memories from super young me. 

In the end when you look in the mirror and you don't like what you see its time to change.  Sometimes you just need to look at whats happening around you and know that its happened because you made it so.

Life is about experiences, your own and others. As you go though it is important to take in EVERYTHING around you because you will need it later on in life. One need to learn from not only your own mistakes but others as well. This may mean not doing something stupid twice or even taking advice of a friend. 

There needs to be a balance of good judgment of following your heart and following your head. If you have lost your cool and are freaking out time to look into your heart for the answer and when your heart broken or sad its time to listen to your head and draw from the experiences in your life and use your head to choose what is the best thing to do.

and when your head and heart say different things that is when you NEED to listen to a friend, sometimes you wont like it but you will KNOW what the right thing to do it.

And in the end when things dont go right, all you can blame is yourself and your choices that lead you to that point, you can have all the advice in the world but YOU are the one who made that choice and acted on it.

Once things are said and done you cant take it back, its already out there. There is no one to blame but yourself.

There is only so many times you can say sorry when it starts to get old, and sorry does not fix everything. if you hurt someone enough there is no turning back and there is NOTHING you can do. ""sorry"" is only a word, and words mean nothing to a broken heart or a hurt friend.

If one keeps pushing and pushing and doing the wrong thing it will only push people out of your life... not everything has to be about yourself and you should ALWAYS look at yourself from the out side before deciding 'ok its about me now' when you may -in fact- be the one in the wrong. Just because your in pain doesn't made to special - yes you are in pain and thats bad - but its no reason to use that pain to get what you want. 

When it is time to think about yourself and your the one in need of support then listen and take advice always be honest and never lie. if you are truthful with the world and have everything out in the open then there is nothing anyone can say about you behind your back because everyone knows anyway.

When one lies  one loses apart of them selfs, and where do you go from there, mix it with a truth to make it better? lie a little more to cover up? soon it will go too far and all that you have are lies soon you dont know what to think at all.

the best way to be is open to everything and live your life right. never hide. never lie. always be supportive. and treat people right.

Just because your in pain doesn't made to special - yes you are in pain and thats bad - but its no reason to use that pain to get what you want. 

When it is time to think about yourself and your the one in need of support then listen and take advice always be honest and never lie. if you are truthful with the world and have everything out in the open then there is nothing anyone can say about you behind your back because everyone knows anyway.

When one lies  one loses apart of them selfs, and where do you go from there, mix it with a truth to make it better? lie a little more to cover up? soon it will go too far and all that you have are lies soon you dont know what to think at all.

the best way to be is open to everything and live your life right. never hide. never lie. always be supportive. and treat people right."	Flaky-Town1175	post	25.296916207279516	female	White	0.0037315695080906153	na	na	na	1	offmychest	failed

"We started dating this year. He's always been a traditional guy. He told me ' I'd probably never see him cry. Except maybe when his dog dies ' 
at first, he kept to it. Until I opened up about myself. I'm not someone who talks about their past. I usually keep vague answers, my parents weren't that great, which is why I don't talk to them anymore. My ex's weren't that good to me. 
 Friends I had weren't really nice to me. So I don't talk to them anymore. 
 The few times I did open a little bit. The people would get quiet, distant. Or become the same as other people in my past. 
 For whatever reason. One night we were talking and I told him something that happened to me. 
 Which led to weeks long period of him pressing further, and Me confessing to everything that has happened in my life. Every time I would start out as if I was simply going to explain a story in third person. Then he would break down. and I would break down. He would say ' I can't believe you could be such a nice, kind and wonderful person after everything you went through ' 
 I'll say a few points. Because I don't want to say too much. I was forced to get pregnant several times in a physically abusive relationship. Another one I was hit so hard my Jaw dislocated. It still dislocates from time to time. I hadn't had a birthday since I was 7. My mother was physically abusive to the point where she would kick me downstairs till I couldn't breathe. And That was a good day. I moved out when I was 17. 
Every single 'friend' I had would either use me for money, or be manipulative. and That's only the tip iceberg. I even had to change my last name because my ex's/family were so terrible. 
 When he said ' I don't know how you could be such a good /nice person after everything you went through ' I just nervously laughed and said ' idk ' 
Honestly, I don't know. Always made right decisions. I don't even drink or like alcohol. But when I have made a mistake, the karma has blown drastically out of proportion, like everyone was waiting for me to fail. It got to the point where I look back on my life as you would reading a history book. It's information. I can't even cry physical tears anymore, unless I'm severely physically distraught. 
 I've brought this masculine man to tears. We'll even be hanging out sometimes, he'll tell me how wonderful and gorgeous I am. Then he'll break down and say I can't believe you had to go through all that. He's such a wonderful person. and I don't want him to be sad anymore. It makes me realize just how bad my life really was when I've been able to get through most of it. 
 Now. Whenever I mention I haven't done something. He books me surprise appointments/ trips. He booked me a manicure/ pedicure because I said I never had one before. 
 He got me a beautiful diamond necklace because I mentioned I'd only ever bought cheap jewelry. and Have never been gifted any jewelry before. 
 He made me an appointment for a hair salon. Because I've only been to a professional stylist twice in my life. He's planning a trip for us to go to Mexico. and Planning a big Christmas with his family. Honestly. I'm angry. I guess some people who've lived through war zones have had it worse than me. But I never realized it was not far off till I met him. This is what a normal relationship is like. This is how it's supposed to be. I'm so angry and upset. And dating him has given me a newfound confidence. 
 I've gotten into looking into SA laws for my country. Found out there's no statute of limitations for sa between partners cohabitating over a certain period of time.

"I am 20 and my ex is 18. We've been together for 3 years and lately things got pretty bad. I was at my lows due to my mother's health issues and my tough semester at the university (law major)

I didn't have any power to give anything to her. I was stressed and angry all the time so she broke up with me because she said that she needs to expirience new relationships. pretty bad breakup not gonna lie.

One month of no contact i apologized for crossing some lines during our break up and she didn't reply and blocked me. Then she apologized and since 21th of July we've been in contact. From start she was telling me about the guy that she met and that they kissed and that she has zero feelings for me. Tough pill to swallow. From then on we met couple of times and hooked up couple of times and she slowly was admitting to what is she feeling really. I know her situation and due to issues at her family home she has a mechanism of dealing with stressfull situation- just to escape from emotions and don't talk about them. She did that many times during relationship (being sad,scared,stressed)

And i guess i was that confident about what she is feeling really towards me that i said ,,I know you love me but you are scared to say that'' and i was right.

But things that she said during her ,,escape/rebound phase'' was too much. She didn't want to get rid of the new guy when i said sorry i can't be part of your life when he is there also.

We had one week of no contact then and she started to realizing whats important and that its true, pure love and a special bond that we have.

We got back together knowing it will be hard to make things work but we decided that it is worth it

But i can't get the messages, what she has told me about the new guy, that she didn't love me that she wants to seek for new realtionships and explore.

Everything now seems honest, like she really understood that it's special

"I have a few random suggestions. Why don’t you take up an exercise hobby together? This way it’s not focused on the losing weight but being together and maybe pick something spicy like salsa dancing. You can also ask her for other types of intimacy things like cuddling naked with no end destination for sex. Since she is not feeling comfortable in her own skin having you there helping that way might help both of you. You can also have more conversations without the sex about fantasies. I would also recommend trying sexting. Is she taking care of herself? If she is ask her if she would like you to get her a toy. There are some amazing fun ones out there that are external stimulators. (If you have questions on those feel free to reach out, I work with a few companies that deal in these products from the view point of helping partners be together)

In no way should you push her (I know you aren’t this is just for the people who can’t read how much you love and respect her). 

I would ask what do you miss as part of the sex? Is it the o or is it the intimacy? There are many good ways to work on that. 

Unfortunately, I have gone through something similar and many of these ideas have helped.

At that age I would say menopause will be playing a huge role.  Go and see a doctor, there are things that can be done.	justbreezy2023	reply	na	na	na	0.9993175268173218	no	no	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.
"I think she needs to find a good doctor who will do a complete physical including full blood panel to check all her hormones etc. People often underestimate the severity  symptoms of menopause and how some women can find it completely debilitating. Symptoms can include visceral fat, sleep problems, extreme fatigue, brain fog, vaginal dryness that causes painful sex no matter how aroused she is, loss of desire, severe joint pain, hair loss, dry skin just to name a few. Put all these together and it’s pretty exhausting. These symptoms can be significantly decreased with the help of a good doctor and the right medication. It’s important she find a GP who specialises in women’s health because tbh some doctors are like “it’s menopause too bad. Deal with it” when symptoms can be treated and supported. 
FYI it’s also not a matter of just loosing weight either. Women in particular stages of menopause can still gain weight eating as little as 1200 calories a day. It’s due to the hormonal changes and changes that causes in sugar level regulation. But cutting out drinking will help her a lot. 
I’d recommend possibly watching some YouTube videos. There’s a few Board Certified OB/GYN who have great videos on the subject. It’s important that you have an understanding of what she might be going through also. I’m 45 and going through pre-menopause and honestly it’s quite frightening how much it feels like it’s destroyed me. 10 years ago I would never have imagined I could physically feel so bad. I’m waiting for my specialist appointment now. 
It is possible for her to feel like her old self again but she will need to see a doctor.

You will. I’m sure it’s ebbed and flowed the whole marriage. Put in the same amount of work you’d put in to find it elsewhere and I would bet she comes around. Date her. Find out what makes her tick. Make sure YOU are also putting in work on yourself. Find a new sport to learn with her. Golf, beachcombing, geocaching, etc. Don’t tell her “let’s start doing this”- instead plan a whole date day or night and try it out. Even an Escape Room, antiquing or something else low activity where you are enjoying something together will be a bonding experience. Women go through the effin ringer later in life. Organs we no longer need are sabotaging us. Our purpose for living move out and live their own lives. It’s hard and sad and can be very difficult to navigate. And the hormones make those feelings feel so real. I’m in the throes of it myself & through medication & my husbands renewed pride in himself things have been good for us. Truthfully the biggest thing has been what he has done for himself. Seeing him have pride in himself, his appearance, our home, etc does a lot for a woman. You can tell her she looks great but she needs to FEEL like you desire her. Flirt with her, take her on dates, ask to join her on mundane errands, tackle some of the things she’s been saying she’d love to do around the house. Oh she’s wanted a birdbath for 2 years? Make it a Saturday project together. My husband doesn’t like to run errands so he is my driver instead- he drops me off at the door and when I text that “I’m done” he swings around and picks me up.

"The terrible diet and lack of exercise are also big contributing factor, it is very unhealthy and quite a burden for you to deal with as it will compound over time, and it is unfair since you are taking good care of yourself and want to help her. 

If you don’t bring it up seriously and don’t ask her to change her ways for her own sake and sake of your relationship, then she doesn’t value it, and it will affect you. You will have to think about if this is the life you want to live. As great as it might have been at the start, people change and want to go separate ways, and there should be a place for compromise but if she doesn’t want to do anything for you, you are not the problem

Kids are moved out, so if you decide do divorce, remember you don’t need to see it as failed relationship but a successful one that happened to came to an end.

"Your situation is both terrible and common. Most marriages evolve to having mismatched libidos all along the range of sex not enough times per day, to no sex ever in years. (BTW, it’s definitely not always the male who’s sex starved.) It’s hardly a she wins, you lose game though because she sounds unhappy too. Sedentary, overweight, menopause, poor diet, possible loss of purpose from the empty nest, her frustrated husband. Depression is complicated but it can be self reinforcing, meaning intervention, say with a mental health pro, might be important.

You might consider a therapist too. How to talk effectively with your wife without making her feel worse is difficult. Having expert advise on that helps not only by being expert, but also relieves blame on you for being antagonistic when you tell your wife you’re acting on the suggestions of a mental health pro.

It may be that her lack of interest will fade. Maybe all the way to your level, but also quite possibly nowhere near that. If the latter, you might explore some creative alternatives, on the premise that cheating is more of a gradient than a cliff. For starters, carefully choose a friend and divulge your situation to him (probably but not necessarily male). This can be powerful. Imagine having a beer and literally laughing out loud together about the absurdities of the world of sex. The odds are his marriage also has some sex tensions, but even if they’re humping like bunnies, if he’s a good friend he’ll respond well.  Maybe he’ll have good ideas, but even if not, you’ll have a trusted confidant, and a probably steep reduction in shame and embarrassment. The reason this activity can feel like cheating to your wife is that it’ll probably take a toll on her knowing you exposed her failure (especially if she also knows your friend).

A little further along the cheating gradient might include spending time at a nude beach or spa or resort. No actual sex but “even if you’re on a diet you can still look at the menu.” Same with watching other people have sex. These two things can be frustrating for sure, but there are subtleties that can be helpful. A big one is practicing the ability to take joy in other people’s joy, rather than shrinking into jealousy. If sex starved you can feel joy when you’re seeing someone get the goods you should also be getting, you reached a rare level of enlightenment. I believe this is a lofty goal, and later on, it’ll be crucial for growing old gracefully.

Yet further, a massage with a happy ending or an escort to do the same, that is, sexy times but no penetration, no STDs. This would require your wife to practice some of that joy for others’ joy thing (sometimes called compersion), but it’s very good when you and your wife both learn to want each other’s happiness even when it might hurt some and be somewhat difficult to accept.

Further along includes threesomes where your wife can but isn’t obligated to participate. This is unlikely to fly unless you two earlier did some of that, but in the abstract it perfectly fills the gap between high and low marital libidos.

I know these compromises on the cheating gradient are unusual and to some extent risky. But in addition to bringing compersion into sharp focus, your wife may respond like you’re worth competing for (which as her kids’ father and for many other things you absolutely are), meaning lose weight, exercise, be more active, maybe even give the hubby some sexy time.

A true affair is extremely hard on most marriages. But so is one partner’s sex starvation, and it’s reasonable to balance your long term suffering with some novelties that scratch the itch a little or a little more. The goal is to fortify and improve the marriage for both spouses. Unusual solutions are needed to put some winning in your no-win situation.

It's hard to face reality and understand that the person with lower libido controls sex. You can read 20 books and fully understand your partner and the situation. You can buy lots of toys. You can do stuff together, wash dishes, buy flowers, go on dates... but in the end, if your partner doesn't want it, all your efforts can simply end with a no. And it is frustrating (especially if your partner participates and appreciates the gesture but considers them all a desperate attempt to get sex). 

Communication is very important, but after watching too many YT videos and reading books, IMHO, the best options available to the partner with higher libido are the ones that include other people.

"howdy reddit!

i am a trans man,  i am seventeen,  & i am starting testosterone on friday (hopefully,  it's complicated.)  this is a good thing!  i know this!  i've wanted this since i was thirteen & i had come out as non-binary.  i am excited because i can finally be *me*.  i'm so,  so,  *so* pumped.

i feel guilty though.  i have a friend,  my best friend,  who i call a brother.  he helped me grow into who i am now,  with more confidence in myself & he shaped my humour & my writing & my interests;  he is always down to clown,  always down to listen to my ramblings about my interests,  always willing to help me clown on idiots on twitter.  he is also transgender,  nineteen,  & he has been wanting to get on t for years longer than i have but he can't access healthcare privately like i did.

my family are all incredibly supportive;  some have had to adjust but they all took they/them pronouns & two name changes in strides.  my family aren't at all well-off but with time they helped me afford to pay for private healthcare,  because i haven't a job yet (i'm searching & applying now!).  his family isn't as supportive as mine;  his is largely still bigoted though a few members of his family are accepting of him or improving.  he's working but private healthcare is lengthy & expensive to get,  & he can't set aside the money to save up with bills & largely no family support.

he's previously expressed to me that,  when he sees other transmasculine people getting on t & getting top surgery at 16/17/18,  it fills him with a visceral sense of jealousy.  this is understandable to me bc.  it sucks seeing other people getting what you desperately need at so young,  but his extends out so far that he can't feel happy for them,  because it hurts so much to see.  again,  i get it.  he's expressed to me that when it comes to my private transition he doesn't want to know details because it hurts which i've respected but...  he's previously stated that if i start t before him he probably won't talk to me for a while.  *i'm starting t on friday if it all works out.*  i haven't told him,  because i dunno dude i feel bad for getting this far but not being able to bring him along with me???  & i don't want things to be weird???

i've vented to my partners & other trans friends about this before;  all say i shouldn't feel bad about it & if he wants to distance himself,  so be it.  but.  fuck,  man.

my plan is to get the prescription & then tell him?  i guess?  it's either that or medically transition silently without telling him it happened which feels more dickish.  i don't know. 

i think that's all.

You definitely should NOT feel bad at all.

"I won’t be saying my age or anything as to not expose myself but we are all the same age and fairly young. Sorry for the long post.

Last year, I started my first serious relationship which lasted around 6 months. Towards the end of the relationship, I could tell she wasn’t happy and I did nothing about it and effectively let the relationship end. 

She was fairly close with my friends before the break up so I said I was ok with them staying friends but I wasn’t really okay with it and just let it happen. I asked her to do one thing though, and that was to just not date any of my friends, to which she replied “You really don’t know me that well if you think I would do that”. After the break up I did something which I know I was the ass hole in, which was about 12 hours after we broke up I met with another girl and posted it on my story on my social media, which I knew she’d see. She understandably got very pissed and after that we have had very little contact.

A few months ago, in April, I found out my friends had been talking to her a lot more without me and it felt like they were choosing her over me at times. I decided to try and contact her to try and see if we could become friends again as I was scared they would choose her over me if it came to it. It was unsuccessful and I came to terms with it, but at the end of our conversation she said “if you want to get into contact with me again, speak to to M. 

M has been my friend since before we were teenagers and up until that point we had been very close. After that, they started talking to me less and less and I had my suspicions that something was going on between M and my ex.

After about 6 weeks of being pretty much excluded and not talking to my friends ever outside of where we went to school, where they avoided me still and I only really talked to them in lessons we had together, I finally confronted M and he denied it. I also talked to my other friend, who I considered to be one of my closest friends if anything was happening between M and my ex and he assured me that there wasn’t, and stated that even if there was, would I be mad about it which of course I would be.

Since then I’ve had very little contact with my friends and in summer break I saw them on snap maps always meeting up with each other but constantly excluding me and not even letting me know about it. I was speaking to my girlfriend about the situation and she said that they were definitely all hiding the fact that my ex and M were together and in my gut, I knew it too but I didn’t want to say anything.

Eventually, last night, I managed to get a hold of W for the situation, which he kept being avoidant about. This was the first time I had spoken to him on a call outside of texting, (which I always had to initiate any conversations in) and he kept reassuring me that nothing was happening, but I was persistent. Eventually I got him to get M to tell me the truth and I find out everything.

Since April, M and my ex have been dating, and two of my friends knew about this but didn’t say anything and when confronted would lie and or be avoidant. Since this morning, I decided to cut those 3 friends out of my life as I confirmed they were the only ones who knew anything about it but it’s hard.

On one hand I just want to forgive them and move on because I really enjoyed their company but it’s just unforgivable. For the last few months I have been overthinking and been sick and worrying and have lost a lot of weight. Since last night I was especially nauseous and didn’t get much sleep until I decided to just remove them on every social media and block them where I can. Since this morning I have received a text from W asking if everything is alright, which I didn’t respond to.

I also found out my ex had a crush on W back in December roughly but was told to suppress it by M as it would hurt the friendship between me and him yet he decided to do it anyways. The worst thing is that someone did do something similar to him, where there was a girl he liked for a couple years that he always talked to but they never met up due to distance but he had other friends there on that side of the country and found out that one of his friends had started dating her and since then, to my knowledge he has cut off both of them.

I am seeing them tomorrow for an event at our school but I am planning to avoid them. It mostly hurts that they lied to me for months on end and the situation could have never happened if he had just asked if it was ok rather than lie to me."

that is very sad and childish of your friends, my only suggestion is to forgive and move on probably finding new friends. if you do decide to keep your friends just make sure to never trust them. good luck with your decision.

"Might be a sensitive topic, might not. I'm 16F. The age of consent in my state is 16.
The person who has been my only sexual partner the past 4 months recorded me without my consent; I wasn't aware until his girlfriend called me at 2AM and we got into an ""argument"" which was basically her calling me derogatory insults to shame women over and over and me throwing ridiculous insults back at her. Mid argument she (18) sent a view once photo which was clearly me having sex with her (18) boyfriend. I literally was gagged and came to realization he had taken pictures of me without me knowing? I took a screenshot without thinking... however the picture won't even show up since WhatsApp has some
""privacy protection security"". I knew this girl was his ex but this guy obviously never mentioned she was his girlfriend. I feel so stupid and she has harassed me twice over text where we have petty one hour arguments until the second argument she pulled out that photo. She has given out men my number and these men ask me if they can spend the night with me, how much I charge a night, basically like l'm a prostitute. She's obviously getting a kick out of this and I don't know what to do? Is there anything I can do since both of them are considered adults and I'm a minor? I feel so hurt because I was just tossed aside and she did say some hurtful things that make sense as to why he never took me seriously, it just hurts so bad. May I add that the picture is pretty recent too, it's from the last time I saw him which was last month, the first week of July. I just put the very much clear pieces together and came to conclusion that she went through his phone, got my numbers + pictures. I also find it very weird that she has MY naked pictures? I'm trying to stay calm and honestly laugh at the situation but it is eating me alive because it is truly humiliating and I have not told anyone about this. I can definitely provide screenshots of the text ""arguments"" if anyone is interested, but the texts are in Spanish. Any advice?

My older sister, who’s 19, has been dealing with depression for a while. It’s been really tough on her, and I’ve tried my best to be there for her. But, I guess I’ve been a bit distant emotionally, thinking that it’s what’s expected of me.

A few days ago, I heard her crying in her room. This time, for some reason, it hit me differently. I found myself tearing up as well, feeling a rush of empathy and concern for her. It was like a dam had broken inside me, and I couldn’t hold back my emotions any longer.

"We went to eat dinner at her house last night and she asked if I was pregnant. I said no, because I’m not, and she handed us these sonogram pictures of her 17 week fetus. My heart dropped. 

On one hand, I am extremely happy for them. Her fiancé thought he couldn’t have kids, so it’s his first baby and I know he’s excited to be a dad. They weren’t exactly planning on having one but they weren’t doing anything to prevent one either. And of course if they need anything, I will be there for them. That’s my family too. 

But… I had a miscarriage in January. And I’ve already been spiraling about the economy and my lack of passion for life and my lack of future plans. I’ve been super jealous of everyone who can afford to have kids. I’d personally do everything in my power to keep a child out of poverty if I could, so I’m definitely not going to try for one. 

She was pregnant back in January, we found out on the same day and told each other, and then we lost them about the same time. This time she is a lot further along, and I’m not pregnant at all. I’m heartbroken for myself, and I feel like i’ll never be in a place to have a child.

"My name is fairly common so I am used to being multiple of us in one class. Usually, people just solved it by adding the first letter of our last names - so for example Sarah S (not my real name).

Now it's not even an option. So what's the next logical move in people's minds? Adjectives. Not even to us but between themselves. 

I just know I will end up with the shorter end of the stick. So she could be ""the pretty Sarah"", ""the skinny Sarah"", or ""the smart Sarah"". I am not ugly or obese, I am fairly average but she seems really pretty based on her profile pic.

I know most of you will think ""who cares"" but I do. I am not even insecure in daily life but this brings out my worst anxieties. In my country, all classes are with the same people so they will have to find a way to differentiate us and that's the logical next step. 

There is not even a way for us to shorten our names differently. It really sucks to think I will be constantly compared to someone. My last hope is that I can get good grades to be ""the smart Sarah"" lmao

"Hey I have a common name too, I know how you feel, I am sick of never being the only one with my name in any given group. I hated being called ""Sarah S"" and not being able to use just my name like everyone else. 

Fortunately that stuff disappeared after high school. Turns out no adult wants to go by ""Sarah S"" or any other silly nickname. 

Trust me when I say that having someone with your name in a uni class means far less than it would have in high school. Uni classes are bigger and you don't know everyone like you did in high school. I just don't think it will be an issue for you, no one is going you stick you with some silly name like ""Skinny Sarah"".

"Hi, 

I was with my wife at the end of what was supposed to be a *VERY* good day, right around 10pm when we were waiting for a taxi, a random dude just came to me asking ""why am i looking at him ?"" I said ""am not"" he asked again, I went to explain that am waiting for a taxi, and before i finish my phrase, BAM! 

And he walked away. 

The guy was bigger than me, and before he came to us he was indeed acting weird, trying to cross the street from  the ""wrong place"" and kinda ""jumping around"" or something. 

We called the cops but probably nothing will ever happen (its Barcelona). 

Here is what am struggling with, 

The logic part in me keep saying that this is just an accident, sure he was an asshole, but i should consider myself lucky that he didn't do anything else, but also happy that i didn't engage because Crazy/Drug strength can be out of this world (I heard stories of basically 'invincible' drug addict unless you use a weapon).  

But at the same time, i can't git this shit out of my head, I feel weak and defeated, and to make matter worse, the next day i was biting a tiny biscuit when my top front tooth broke. 

Now the good news is that i already have a dental crown-bridge, so i didn't really lose a teeth (lost them years ago as a teenager lol) 

The other good news is that when i went to the dentist they told me that i grind a lot and that weakened the crown, the punch and the biscuit just made it break faster.

And the final good news is that I have insurance that will cover 65% of the cost (~4k euro). 

&nbsp;

But now i have a temporary fix, and i got to be careful, etc... and every time my tongue touch that area I get that ""defeat"" feeling, every time I think that the police here won't do anything I feel a little bit of boiling inside. 

(I have an appointment tomorrow where i will give them the medical report and the bill, maybe things will change)


And to make matter worst, I recently got diagnosed with ADHD (i had it my whole life, i just didn't knew [am 30y.o]) so you can imagine my obsession about this. 

Have any of you been in a similar situation ? and do you have any advice ?

"You're not weak and you weren't defeated. Truth be told, getting into a fight is the worst possible idea anyone can have because if the police get involved, assault charges start going around. That guy could have said you were threatening him or had done something earlier to him. Throwing hands, even in self-defense, makes for a bad time. 

Think of it like this: my nephew goes to a dojo for karate. He's honestly super good at it, too. His hands move like Jackie Chan (probably not really, but you get the idea). My father makes jokes that he could kick all our asses. But my nephew always says, ""No, sensei says we should never really get into a fight. It's wrong to hurt people."" Karate is a form of art to him, and even though he could use it to defend himself, he says he'd still only block and never hit back. 

You did nothing wrong. You didn't stare at this guy. You didn't antagonize him at all. He was fucked up in the head for whatever reason. And like you said, it was a sucker punch. By definition, you didn't see it coming and couldn't have done anything different. It's not on you. You weren't defeated at all, and you're certainly not weak.

"This is the complete experience of victimhood.

This is very unfortunate and quite upsetting.. I’m so sorry to hear this happened to you. You can tell merely from your post that you are a decent human being.

I have been subjected to such victimization as well, as sadly so have countless others.

Here’s the advice I can give you- look into your heart and forgive him.

I know… it sounds ridiculous right.

What I mean is, contemplate. Realize that the man in question was likely on drugs. He himself had been through trauma which has likely lead him to drug use. Realize that the man who assaulted you has likely been a victim (as a child perhaps, I mean child molestation was and is rampant, mothers neglect and abandon their sons (often those mothers have been subjected to traumas and their own drug use etc leads them to abandon their kids). There is a ubiquitous cycle of generational trauma that has always plagued mankind since indigenous peoples have been colonized (world wars only amplified this phenomenon). 

Sadly, on that day you were unwillingly caught up in that cycle of trauma haunting mankind. 

My advice is forgive him, that’s what mankind needs. 

Harboring the hatred and anger is only damaging to your health. Distressing thoughts like that can rise blood pressure and cause heart conditions. It can induce psychological conditions and obsessions.

Today begins your journey towards peace- through forgiveness. 

That’s what I had to learn when I was wronged like you were.

You can do this. ❤️

"TW: mention of self harm and drinking   
Sorry in advance for long post.  Me (24F) and my ex (25M) dated for a year and 2 months before I cheated and ruined the whole relationship. Our relationship seemed so perfect. We rarely fought and were both so in love with each other. His parents would always say they know I’m the girl he’s going to marry and that they’ve never seen him so in love with a girl before. Here is where it went bad. I decided I wanted to live abroad for 6 months and volunteer before I started medical school. This is where our first big fight came from. He didn’t want me to go, he thought I wanted to act single and find myself and he wanted something serious. I understood his point of view but I felt like going abroad would be a good opportunity and that I deserved it after 5 intense years of undergraduate, some of it being remote due to Covid, losing a semester to go to rehab, and spending 8 months studying for my mcat.

 I told him to come with me, he started the application then backed out. He went with his family to israel for two weeks (this is the country I was moving to for 6 months) and returned to the states 2 days before I arrived in israel. I told him to extend his stay so he can see me in israel but he didn’t want to. We did long distance and things were fine but the time zone was hard and I fell into a depression while being away from home. At first he would surprise me with gifts but then once I got accepted into medical school and we realized I’d be moving to a different state, he changed. He was happy for my acceptance but would make comments asking me to stay with him or take online classes and live with him (he lived with his parents). 

I would constantly bring up him moving with me for 4 years while I complete school but he didn’t want to. He also was getting very upset that I was abroad and traveling and would call my program coordinator and yell at them for how awful the program was. he was supposed to visit me for a month and I thought I’d feel embarrassed introducing him to my coordinator after he yelled at him on the phone. 

I started going out a lot with some girls from my trip and they were heavy drinkers. We would go on 5 day drinking benders and flirt with the bartenders for free alcohol. They were all in relationships so when I was drunk, I felt like if they were doing it then it must be ok for me. One night, i was really drunk and the bartender was all over me. I was saying such dumb things to him in Hebrew (I'm not fluent so I was saying random words my friends told me to say) and i didn't know they were having me say things like horny, sexy etc, until after they had me say it. The bartender came close to me and tried kissing me and I pushed him away and went home. I immediately called my boyfriend and told him what happened. He was so angry and said that I shouldn't put myself in those situations because he knows how guys act.  But he knows it’s not like me to drink and go out (our whole relationship I was sober) so we made up.

 I continuously kept going out and drinking. He mentioned how hes worried about my drinking and how I kept saying I wanted to stop drinking but I continued to drink. Again, I was acting so stupid in front of now another guy. I was really drunk and he was all over me and then I realized I should go home. As I was waiting for the cab, the guy noticed my arm (I have self harm scars from when I was younger) and he burnt me with his cigarette to give me a scar to ""remember him"". I know it's really messed up. The next day he messaged me on Instagram asking me out. I told him no I have a boyfriend and that he burnt me and it’s a messed up situation. He kept insisting that my boyfriend doesn’t have to know. Again I said no. The next day I was at a club with friends and I messaged him asking to give me a ride home. He insisted that I go out with him first so I blocked him and got a cab home. 

I sat in bed feeling so guilty and realized my current behaviors is what once led me to rehab in the past. The guilt was eating at me for days. My sister told me not to tell my ex because it would worry him and start a fight for no reason. Also, around this time he told me that he was going to a strip club with his guy friends and asked if its okay. I said of course enjoy because I wanted him to have fun and I knew he wouldn't cheat on me and even if he was flirting with the strippers, I knew it was nothing serious. The whole time he was at the strip club, he would text me saying how gross the stripper was and I just felt weird that he was telling me about how she looks. I know exactly how it goes because I wanted to see what a strip club is like so at the beginning of our relationship, we went to one together. I was so uncomfortable because the stripper was flirting with me and she wouldn't really talk to my boyfriend cause I was there and I could tell he was uncomfortable that I was there with him. So i know when he was there he was flirting back and making comments, there is no way he just sat there and had ""small talk"" like he claims he did.

Anyway, my friends were making me feel so guilty about it. They were the ones who initially told me that it's okay to flirt and that flirting isn't cheating when it comes to getting free drinks and stuff but since i asked the guy for a ride on instagram, it means I was cheating. They were making me feel so bad but kept asking me to flirt with guys at restaurants and stuff to get free food for them. I said to them that i'm not gonna ruin my relationship and act stupid for them to get free stuff. I realized that they were never good friends to me. I ended up telling him about the cigarette burning first and he freaked out. He then kept telling me that he knows I kissed a guy and that his friends in israel saw me. even though i didn't kiss anyone, I felt in my head that maybe i did? I felt like i was convincing myself that I did do something more than flirt even though I was never alone with a guy and even though i was drunk, I still could recall what i did. I told him that I didn't do anything other than flirt a little when drunk and that I asked the guy for a ride, he wanted to go out so i blocked him and didn't speak to him again. He asked to see my messages but I had already deleted them so he was suspicious.He broke up with me over the phone and canceled his flight to see me. We went no contact for about 2 weeks. I reached out asking for another chance. He said no. He then reached out saying he loves me and wants to make it work but already told his whole family what I did. He then became dry and short with me then we fought and never spoke again.

 It’s been almost 5 months since the breakup and I’m still a constant mess. Crying everyday. Not able to function. Thinking I’m a cheater who deserves to feel guilty forever. Idk how to move past this. Do I even deserve forgiveness? Part of me feels like i didn't do anything that awful since he also went to a strip club where he claims he only goes there to make fun of girls but I think that's BS. but I also see his point of view because he only knew me as a girl who didn't drink or go out (I was sober) and becoming more religious. He knew I had some crazy history and this whole behavior was old patterns that I still needed to work on. I feel like my behaviors were all self sabotage because I was scared of starting medical school in a new state and I was in a different country so I was looking for ways to cope, even if they were unhealthy.  After the breakup, I'm 100 days sober, in therapy, working on myself again but he wants nothing to do with me and his sister trashed me on the interent :( "	Dramatic-Map784	post	17.9354227527527	female	White	0.9988211989402771	na	na	na	2	offmychest	ethnicity: no prediction, age: 24, gender: female, explanation: the author mentions directly that she is a 24 years old female (24f). there is no information provided that accurately indicates her ethnicity.

You have got to ask yourself if you were able to start over again with him, would you want to feel how you are feeling again?? I am sure your answer is no and even if you do not start up again with him just learn from this and be better next time. Everyone makes mistakes don't worry it is ok.

"I have never told anyone about this, and a throwaway account I’m sorry but I couldn’t never do this on a public account of mine I’m a 15 year old girl this happened when I was 11.
We went on a trip to a waterpark, me, my mother, father and a best friend of mine. It was all going good.
We went on the lazy river and me and my friend were a bit ahead of my parents not too far but a good bit, it’s not like we weren’t capable in the water and safe we were and they were watching us
while me and my friend were playing I notice  a man relatively far away looking at me, I smiled awkwardly as he was staring so hard the type of stare where they don’t look away for even a split second and turn back to my friend and think nothing of it

15 or so minutes later I turn back and the man is still staring the same stare but now is a bit closer still not that close like multiple metres away, I smile again I thought it was the right thing to be polite and courteous.
The moment I turn my back and me and my friend are playing, a couple seconds later I feel hands on my torso.
Everything from here is a blur I remember it being a blur even the day after in my memories  

I remember feeling startled, and jolting to look back, at that point he had fully picked me up and was running (the water was deep enough that I could stand on my tiptoes and have my head over the water so shallow enough for a grown man to semi you know that sort of run/swim type thing you do through deep water)

And before I know it we are around the edge of the pool and multiple metres forward from where I was with my friend, I remember trying to scream but no sounds escaping my mouth I don’t know why or how or just why I couldn’t make a noise I don’t know but I swear I was trying with all my strength to scream

I remember kicking and punching erratically trying to fend him off of me, I’m a small person, I always have been, especially as a child. This man would have to of been over double my weight and 6’0 ish

I remember him holding me in a way where I was against his chest and kind of sitting on him, I remember him grinding up against me and the moment he started doing that I struggled harder, I remember him pulling one hand to my neck choking me harder each time I struggle, he groped me everywhere you could think I don’t want to list things. I remember him pulling at my swimsuit which was a one piece, and pulling the bottom of it aside and touching me and doing other stuff with his hands. I remember as this continued I kicked and punched more and he pushed me under the water fully so my head was underneath it and continued to do that.

My memory has a gap here. I remember blacking out under the water I think because the next thing I remember I was over the water and in his arms my legs wrapped around him. I remember I started kicking and punching to a very extreme extent, scratching and digging my nails in and I remember finally being able to make a sound a scream escaping my mouth and in the commotion or surprise at the scream he let go for a second. 

I actually can’t swim funnily enough, I can float and stuff but not swim, I forgot to mention we had those floaty things they have in lazy rivers and were playing in those but when he grabbed me and pulled me away it wasn’t with the floaty.

But I remember swimming, the fastest swimming ever away from him at max speed against the current and backwards towards where my family and friend must be and I remember him following me.

I remember his hand grazing my skin multiple times I remember seeing that there were other adults around and obviously witnessing what was happening and happened I remember watching them whilst I was struggling whilst he touched me. 

Eventually I made it into view of my parents of and my friend, the moment he saw them he kind of stopped and pretended to be just hanging out, I remember rushing over to my parents and being completely silent and this man approaching them and saying 

“I was just looking after her she went ahead so I thought I should keep an eye on her”

My parents thanked him 

Then for the rest of the cycle until the point where you can get off the lazy river he faced towards me and watched me the whole time.

I never said anything or told anyone nor did my friend who witnessed the whole time.

I felt ashamed, dirty, guilty I smiled at him so I must of asked for that and I didn’t want to be a bother or cause a scene since it wasn’t that bad

My self harm started that same month, I am proud to say I am 1 month and 28 days clean from sh currently but it has been an active addiction for four years. My first suicide attempt was a month after this. I’ve almost lost my life and ended up in resus rooms and the er multiple times from the severity of my sh and suicide attempts. But I’m alive and here now 

I wanted to share this I haven’t told a single soul

I know it’s petty and soft for me as a 17m to come on here and say what im feeling but real sjit I miss hearing I love you be safe I miss being with her in bed and cuddling and making love I miss her precence becuase she was the only thing that really made the annoying negative thoughts disappear yes just by her being in the same room as me was enough for me to feel comfortable becuase I couldn’t find peace in anything else even weed,porn,food it all seems endless but when she was around I was genuinely happy I miss her so much I can look past the hurtful things she expressed at the end becuase she still means everything to me. Even thought everyone around us was saying either she should break up with me or I should leave her all didn’t matter as long as we could be together but to her I couldn’t be the man she wanted she was always pushing change and now I understand why and it was all because I couldn’t escape the mental prison life I was so helplessly in It hurts so bad becuase i was so mentally fucked up I couldn’t even show up for myself any attempt she made to help I just rejected it believing I don’t deserve it I don’t want to make this all about me Wich was another reason why she left all I did was put my problems on her and I hate myself everyday for it she was so perfect and I was nothing I still think about her everyday  if your wondering who she is if u haven’t guessed she was an ex who I had and unhealthy trauma bond too I hate myself for my problems and putting on her.fuck me and fuck life can someone give me advice or something even though I don’t deserve that	Perfect_Presence9312	post	20.2361358084563	female	White	0.0045989141799509525	na	na	na	1	offmychest	'ethnicity: no prediction, age: 17, gender: male, explanation: the author refers to himself as a 17m in the text, indicating he is a 17-year-old male. the text, though, doesn't provide enough details to predict the ethnicity.'
"It's neither petty nor soft. You really must've loved her, but it seems like terminating that relationship was a good thing, because even the best feelings can be toxic too, I'm telling from my own experience.
You will get through this, but it won't be easy. One day you'll just wake up and realize it's over. Cherish any good memories you have, but don't concentrate on her - think about yourself. The desire to feel loved and wanted probably won't lessen, because it seems like you're a very emotional person. You will live with it until you find another person to ease it. For now, do something, find a hobby that annoys you to the point you cannot quit it.

A few years ago my father died after months long fight with terminal cancer.He had several other health problems he was being treated for but when they found out it was because of cancer it was very late. Then the pandemic happened, at first I was very happy to be alone and with my thoughts. Nobody in my surroundings had gone through the type of situation I had so they did not understand. During that period I couldn’t study properly, no matter how hard I tried I couldn’t bring myself to concentrate. I know studying would have helped me distract myself from my father’s death but it did the opposite. Whenever I opened a book and tried to concentrate my mind would spiral back to the last few years of my life. At that time I was glad there was no school no events and minimal human contact but I had failed to realise just how deep of a mess I was digging myself into. Now years later I am still struggling to cope with everything. Even though I have good friends they were never there for me. Maybe I failed to be vocal about my problem but none of them ever mentioned my father’s death anniversary and it has years since his death. No one calls me on that day. It is just me and my family. I wish they would have realised how much it would have helped me if they took 15 minutes out of their lives to ask me how I am feeling. It seems like they were just their for me the day my father died and then they forgot about it. It has been years since his death to the point where I feel like I am using his death as excuse to justify my problems. Is it normal to feel this amount dread years after someone’s death? There has always been stories about people acing their exams, getting their dream jobs after a death of a loved one. Their loved one’s death was a catalysts to their success but that is not what is happening with me. I am getting worse at everything I do. I do not feel comfortable in my life, my body or my head. I am terrified of what is going to happen to me going forward.	eversopillow	post	29.285693103560615	male	White	0.9987202882766724	na	na	na	32	offmychest	no prediction.
"I am so so sorry you’re feeling like this. I really would find a good therapist, a free one if you can if you’re in the right country and don’t mind a few weeks wait. Nobody’s grief is the same so don’t compare it! There are also some good online forums where people talk about their grief so as long as you watch that it’s not triggering you they might also help :) 

I wouldn’t expect your friends to just know it’s the anniversary of your father’s death, I say this kindly but that’s slightly unreasonable. I would however suggest you mention to them how youre feeling and when the anniversary comes round again give them a heads up and ask if you can have their support around that time."	eversopillow	reply	na	na	na	0.9987202882766724	strong	no	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.
"Everyone is different and no two people handle grief the same way. Believe me I know, the most upsetting aspect for me is knowing I own a black suit and every time I put it on it's because I'm going to a funeral I've been to way to many funerals way too many 30+ before I was even in my mid twenties. I went from having one of the largest families in my city to one of the smallest in a very small space of time that anyone would think the grim reaper had a grudge against our family name. I'm still grieving now almost 16 years later over the first one I went to. You need to cut yourself some slack and grieve appropriately. Theres a saying I'm sure your bound to of heard but it goes something like this. 

Time heals, all wounds. 

Whether that's a month from now, or 15 years from now your going to continue to grieve your father and that is perfectly okay. You dont need a succession story because of his death, between you and me I genuinely think it's a bit shallow when people do it as it's always for someone elses ears never their own. You will find your own success and whether you believe in the afterlife or not your father is either watching you proudly or knew how proud he was of you before he passed on.

Heads up, no one has a responsibility to comfort or console you about your personal struggles, yes it’s nice when it happens, but this expectation you hold is unrealistic and indicative of your problems not theirs. Also some sort of expectation and comparison to success stories after family death is something I’ve personally never heard of and comparing your outcomes to others is going to be an obstacle in your personal development.  You have grief and anger displacement on others that you need to figure out.  Find a therapist, through work or school or locally and do put some effort in their guidance….pretty sure things will eventually click and you’ll get some breakthroughs that will see you attaining your goals.	eversopillow	reply	na	na	na	0.9987202882766724	weak	no	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.

My advice would be don’t hesitate to open up to your friends.

I am sure that some of them will be willing and able to be there for you. 

Try to find a therapist, online if there is no one available in your neighborhood. Try to find some activities to do some sport and meet new people. Find things that you like.

However, I know that if they somehow can see us, they wouldn't want us to suffer for an eternity. Your dad would want you to achieve the things that you've set out to do, and to live a great life in his memory. What your doing is grieving, and it's perfectly normal. It feels horrendous, yes- however, it's completely healthy.

Sometimes you feel like you're literally drowning in your feelings, and as though there's an invisible hand around your throat restricting your breathing. It's awful, terrifying, and everything seems uncertain, but I promise- it does not last forever. There isn't a time frame on grief, and it will take as long as it takes to process.

Death can rock people’s entire worlds. I learned of a close loved one’s death, my cousin that i had grown up with who was like a brother to me, via an instagram post while I was on lunch break while at college in 2017. I had just finished my lunch, was waiting for my friends to finish theirs and i opened instagram while I waited and there it was. My loved ones face and a caption announcing that he had died. No one in my entire family called me to tell me. I sat for a while thinking “oh this is gonna hit me later” and then I felt the world tilt and the next thing I know my phone was on the floor and i was uncontrollably sobbing. Couldn’t even speak to tell my friends why i was fine one second and a complete mess the next. I just grabbed my shit and booked it out of there. Thankfully I had already submitted my final works for my course and all i needed to do that day after lunch was to collect a grade and i was able to go home after. But I couldn’t even do that. I went to a friends house and sobbed in her arms for hours until my mum called to see where I was. No one had told her that her nephew had died. And she loved him *so* much. We all loved him so much. And the pain, it never goes away, it lingers like a bad smell. And theres days where the pain isn’t so bad, its more bearable and then theres days where it hits you like a freight train and knocks you off your feet. I equate grief to a being like a broken rib. On the outside you look fine, but in the inside, every breath *hurts*. And I know you don’t feel like it now, and it’s easy for me to sit behind a screen and say this but it *will* get better. You are going to hurt and wallow and feel as though you’re drowning and like you’re suffocating and trying to dig yourself out with your bare hands until one day you’ll wake up and realise that your breathing is just that little bit easier and your head feels just that little bit clearer and the pain is just a little less painful.

I get how it feels to think every one has moved on from your fathers’ death but you can’t blame them and I hope you don’t . Try to talk to them about it maybe that will help.

"hey honey, my dad died end of June 2020, and then just 2 months after it happened i was starting A levels at college. It wasn’t a long term illness, but it was an quick, sudden and traumatising passing which i witnessed and was there for… so although the experience is different, i get it. Studying and balancing grief was unbearable and utterly exhausting. Grief would be exhausting even if you weren’t studying so of course it’s difficult as shit. It’s also been years for me now too. Most people do forget besides family and sometimes i wish i was them. I used to dream of being able to forget. I really struggle on some days and do not want to move from my bed to get to work. In fact, happened to me today. It’s bloody hard, but know you’re trying your best. I find a lot of education and work places have a way to give you a bit of leeway and give you exemptions, maybe it’s something to look into? 
Therapy is terrifying but it sounds like maybe you need some place with no connections to anyone to open up to. A loved ones death is a dark and scary place, but you don’t have to suffer alone. 
I’d say give yourself a break, but from experience there is no break as it’s on your mind 24/7. 
Instead find something you enjoy doing, and cling onto it for dear life. Mine was Sims (silly, i know) but it helped me find a constant in an endlessly changing future. I can not picture my life being the same, and i never feel comfortable thinking about the future as i know it can change in the blink of an eye.

"I am so sorry. Love and warmth. 

I lost my father 2019. In some ways it was a real blessing - I’m glad he didn’t have to suffer COVID or the political mayhem of 2020-21. He didn’t have a long slide into poor health: a heart attack and he was gone. 

I am in my early fifties. I’m an educated man with a successful business. I have a living family, children, and grand children. All this and yet dad’s passing *still f3cks me up.* 

My point is: I can’t imagine having to deal with while still in school or still trying to establish yourself. I can only tell you that I don’t think this is something that goes away - you just get better at dealing with it. Be kind and gentle with yourself. Get some therapy if at all possible.

"I want to start off by saying that I'm so sorry for your loss. It isn't easy losing a family member. I was in a similar situation as you—when I was 18, about 2 semesters into college, my older brother died unexpectedly and it was an extremely confusing, scary, and emotionally devastating event to happen. But you need to keep in mind, not everyone experiences grief the exact same. For me, I had to take a semester or two off of college because I wasn't in any mental or emotional capacity to get school work done—and since it was quarantine, there weren't many options for distractions, not just because there was less access to things outside of the house, but my mind would also spiral back to my grief/my older brother. I started to do very well after losing my brother, but that didn't mean I was okay emotionally—it just meant that I was looking for any and every distraction I could find so that I didn't have to think about the fact that he isn't here anymore or that he'll never get married or even turn 30. The road from grief to being fully functional again is not linear—it's messy and confusing, but I swear it gets much easier.

I have to agree that your friends likely don't actually know the exact anniversary of your father's death: I would venture guess that at least some of them may have a hard time knowing how to approach the subject of death—perhaps they don't want to upset you or bring up unwanted memories, or perhaps some of them have never actually encountered death in the family the way you have, so approaching it is still a mystery to them. I still think that your feelings are valid; grief can feel extremely isolating, especially if no one else you know has lost an immediate family member. I've experienced this too. But perhaps you can ask your friends if you can vent to them about it, at least so that you can get those feelings off your chest with them. I would say that it would definitely benefit you to find some therapy to help process the loss and fully come to terms, and I would also recommend maybe joining grief forums if therapy isn't an option—there are some right here on reddit, I believe, and I'm sure grief forums exist on other parts of the internet. 

I promise that it gets easier. I swear. In time, the future won't be as confusing or as scary. Very, very few people are ever fully okay just a few years after a loved one's death—I know I'm still not fully okay 3 years after the fact—so please don't rush the healing process. Your experience with grief is your own and it's still valid regardless. You just need to give yourself time, and build a strong support system. 

Best wishes."	eversopillow	reply	na	na	na	0.9987202882766724	strong	strong	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.
"My sister’s death shattered me, but I’m the exact opposite of you in that I don’t like talking about it and appreciate that no one (save my family) brings her up at all. I don’t want to be asked how I am because then I’ll just have to lie and say I’m fine, or healed, or moved on, and that’s not the case. It’s been years and I’m still nowhere near being okay about it. 

Because I’m this way, I sort of assume others are, too, so I never bring up someone’s deceased loved ones without prompting. Especially around important occasions like anniversaries, birthdays, etc. I don’t want to unintentionally open any wounds. 

Maybe your friends are like this. Or maybe they’re just awkward as hell, which is fair. Lots of folks don’t know how to deal with grief—seeing it makes them uncomfortable, and it’s not fair to ask them to set aside their own discomfort to comfort *you.*

Your friends aren’t mind readers. They might not understand what’s going on with you without being told because grief affects everyone differently. You need to talk to them and let them know how you feel, but don’t expect anything from them, and respect their boundaries, too.

Also, they’re not therapists, OP. They’re not obligated to counsel you on this, or assist you in healing. That’s a personal journey you yourself must embark on. Moreover, just because it seems like they’re outwardly unaffected by their own losses, if any, doesn’t mean they actually are. 

Finally, look into therapy if that’s an option for you. I’m in the process of looking into it myself because I’ve finally realized that my sister’s death genuinely traumatized me and I’m never going to be okay without professional help. I don’t know how to cope with such a massive loss, and I don’t understand how others can lose such a huge chunk of themselves and just…carry on without being negatively impacted by that loss. 

Best of luck to you, OP. I understand, and I hope you heal some day."	eversopillow	reply	na	na	na	0.9987202882766724	no	strong	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.

"I would suggest contacting your local Hospice organization. They helped me so much when my son died. They have a 6 week one evening a week group meeting where you will be with other people who have the same loss as you do. It’s free and amazingly helpful to be in a room with other people who have suffered the same loss as you. The groups are very specific mine was for parents who lost a child. Yours would be for a person who has lost a mother or father they were close with. It starts with a single visit to a therapist (again free) from there they will notify you of when a group that fits your needs. I really recommend it. You’ll be able to talk about your dad and hear others who feel the way you do. 
It never goes away but it becomes a part of your life that is easier to deal with. One suggestion I have is to continue to talk about your dad the good times funny stories. I talk about my son and it’s now been 16 years July 4. At times it feels like yesterday he  was 20. Sometimes I feel like I just dreamed his life. My older son and I have become very close and talk about him often. Best of luck to you in finding peace.Always  keep him close to your heart. ❤️"	eversopillow	reply	na	na	na	0.9987202882766724	weak	strong	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.
"There is no wrong way to grieve. The first step you have to take is being honest with yourself about your problems. Accept where your grief ends and your responsibilities begin and while that won't make it better, I feel you are being very hard on yourself.

Has anyone ever talked to you about therapy or depression? Grief counseling can be really good for you.

If I have one piece of advice, it would be to keep a mood journal. Write down your pain. When it happens. What you were thinking about. Don't berate yourself for these feelings, feelings are valid. It can be really helpful to let them out. Plus, if you start going to therapy, it'll actually be really helpful for your therapist to read once you are comfortable with them.

It's not too late to change the road you're on. I know how you feel. It wasn't a parent, but I lost people very very precious to me. I blamed myself, hated myself for years. I plucked out my hair, I ran away from my home and lived on the streets. I stopped living for almost a decade. The only thing I didn't do was drink or drug because I didn't want to numb the pain. I did everything else I could to destroy myself.

I got help. I found support and turned my life around. Some days are easier than others. It can get better.

Some people say that everything ends, eventually. That includes the bad times, too.

I’m sorry your feeling this way. My dad passed away 7 years ago. Every one has a their own way of grieving. My sister likes to remember our dad’s anniversary of his passing. We spend time together at the beach which was our dad’s favorite place. I would refer not to remember the day he died but it helps my sister and it’s usually low key. None of my friends reach out on that day and I don’t expect them too. It’s not an important date for them. My partner who I met long after my dad had passed saved the date in his phone because to him it was important to remember. I don’t hold it against my friends at all.

Never in my life have I ever heard that a loved ones death was a catalyst to success, well maybe if they had a big payout and hired someone to off them.

"Comparing your dad dying to other people losing loved ones is a very weird thought process. Everyone’s parents die eventually, has every person in history done something great afterwards? No, obviously not. I understand loss is a hard thing to deal with but at a certain point you need to realize you are the one holding yourself back. Your dad dying years ago is not stopping you, the only thing doing that is yourself. If you want people to treat you differently then you need to say something. Even your best friend in the world can’t read your mind, people don’t know if you don’t say something. Personally I don’t remember or even think about the death of a friends parent, just as I’m sure they wouldnt think about mine unless it’s mentioned but if I knew that my friend had a very hard time on that day then of course I would be there for them

You can’t control the way you feel, what you can control is how you deal with that feeling. I don’t like to say to get over it because that doesn’t help anyone but you really do need to get over it at some point, would your dad want to see you still moping around because he’s gone?

My father was an extremely hard working person. He did everything to provide for us and went through so much. He was youngest of his siblings and by the time his time came to go to university my grandparents had no fund. He had to settle for a normal community collage whereas his sibling went on to some of the best universities in our country. What upsets me the most is none of his sibling ever realised just how privileged they were. One of them died of overdose, another committed suicide because because he couldn’t go to his dream university in another country. I feel like everything that has ever happened to him was unfair. He was partially blind in one eye and one day I heard him crying because he had a fight with his older brother and he angrily called him blind. My father was so incredibly kind and forgiving towards everyone I feel he was taken advantage of. He deserved so much better and I never got the chance to give him everything he missed out on life. My father’s situation made me believe some people came to this world miserable and they eventually die miserable. Of course he had us but it was for such a tiny fraction of his life that it wasn’t enough. He was supposed to be happy, write his poems with a cup of tea without a worry in this world. I feel like I am still not doing enough. I want to be better but it hasn’t happened. I might have come of as weird when I compared people’s success due to the death of their loved ones. I know not everyone is going to have the same ending and that’s okay. I just want mine to be good too.	eversopillow	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9987202882766724	no	strong	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.
"it seems as though you're still deep in grief, which is completely understandable. your father sounds like a brilliant person. I think it is worth perhaps seeking out grief-related support groups and finding ways to cope.

as for your perceptions about success after loss - those stories you've heard are just the rare positive ones that are both easy to see and easy to share. most loss is followed by a period of depression after which there is mostly normalcy aside from the blips of grief that come up now and then. people don't talk about it, because it hurts, but that's the norm. 

I think you shouldn't force yourself to be better because your dad died.

"I put so much effort into prioritizing friendships and relationships but I don't feel like it's reciprocated very often. 

I thought when I moved away that at least one friend would have visited by now. But it's been 2 years and no one has come. Two friends have cancelled last minute two separate times after I already cleaned the whole house in anticipation of their arrival. 

Now one of my friends said she'd come this weekend but it's literally only for one day. I'm glad she's coming at all and I know everyone is busy but I don't have many friends in this city so I go home every 6 weeks spend time with my friends and family. I would love to show the people I love where I live and like show them my life here. 
The thing is, this city is a place that my friends and I used to visit all the time. And when I moved everyone said they'd visit me ""all the time."" One friend even got his passport just so he could visit me and still hasn't come. 

So I'm happy my friend is coming for one day... But I thought it would be for 2 days. So I'm feeling really not prioritized by the people in my life right now. I don't have a lot of family. Only child. Not much extended family. So I take friendships really seriously. 

And yes I've talked to them about it. I already ""broke up"" with one of my best friends a year ago after getting so tired of her not putting effort into our friendship. The last straw was when she lied to saw she was working on my birthday and couldn't see me but she decided to go camping instead and lied about it. 

I'm in my late twenties so I know everyone is busy with life but fuck the pandemic really took away the last of my social years and because I didn't go to university until I was older I was only starting to have fun when I was like 23 because I was working during my normal university years."	astudentiguess	post	35.53652326892699	female	White	0.9967501163482666	na	na	na	17	offmychest	no prediction.

I think this is the perfect opportunity to brush up on your social skills and make new friends. Maybe start a group chat of like minded individuals. Expecting more from your friends isn’t wrong, but I can tell you that from my experience- will ALWAYS lead to disappointment. Just work on you being the best friend anyone can ask for and you will find the right people to be around who will really appreciate that. Or maybe if these friendships really mean a lot to you, help them come see you. Book a flight with them while you’re on the phone with them. Help them get to you. But a rule of thumb, expect less and you will be happier. When you are a great friend, it’s hard to find someone who can be as good a friend as you.

Yes maybe affording it is hard for them to do, but it hurts when you see they’re doing a thousand other things with more than enough money that they could spend on coming to see you.

Therapy is cringe. I've been in the mental hospital 4 times. It doesn't matter how much you cope or get medicated. I live with your sins until you die and everyone should hate me until they die.

"My aunt is extremely sick, she’s 63 years old, trouble breathing, walking, laying down, sitting, standing, chest pains, back pains, not able to talk, sleep eat, basically not able to do anything than feeling pain everywhere, she has diabetes type 1. She’s not from my country, she’s from france.

I called the emergency department, and the nurse told we should call our regular clinic doctor. I kept telling her that they are closed, but she kept insisting I should, she was refusing to listen and kept being rude about it, I got a bit upset and kind of raised my voice saying “Our clinic is CLOSED, you want me to barge into the clinic?!” The nurse got offended and said “if you raise your voice at me again, I’ll hang up.” I honestly got angry cause she didn’t wanna listen to anything, and kept saying we should give paracetamol. The paracetamol wasn’t even working.

I replied with “It’s crazy your not listening to what I’m saying at all, if you wanna hang up, then damn hang up!” And I then proceeded to hang up.

I calmed down for a bit, and called the emergency room again, and this time it was another nurse, I explained my aunts problem again, and the nurse proceeded to say “this sounds extremely serious, especially that she’s a elder and has enormous pain in her chest/heart, I’m sending a ambulance now, and they’ll be there in 10 mins.”

"My mom texted me today and brought up that investigators have been trying to get ahold of me, and haven’t been able to given I now live in a different state. 

Apparently, on their (3rd or 4th) search of my maternal Uncle’s electronics, they discovered what they believe to be sexual content of me as a child, they think I’m 10 in the photos.

The reason they have searched his stuff so many times is because he’s been accused of inappropriate contact with children, namely/recently my little sister (who only recently came forward but has not gone to police). 

I just, i don’t know. I don’t remember anything surrounding the potential image, but I do remember one day just… a switch flipping inside me and I just didn’t like my uncle anymore. Come to think of it, I was probably somewhere around 7-10 years old. 

I don’t really know how to feel. I just needed to get this out there. I called the phone number my mom gave me, and so the investigator is gonna give me a call soon.

UPDATE: Met with the investigator (surprisingly she came super fast, so at least I can move on now. She asked me some questions about my relationship with my uncle and how he was around other kids. Then she showed me the pictures, they were all of me. I looked young, really young. I looked, to myself, to be about 6 or 7. Just kind of feeling empty inside right now. The Victim Resources lady gave me her card.

UPDATE (08/15): Hi, wow, this blew up way more than I ever expected. So, I guess I should first say: thank you for reading, and thank you to everyone who sent support and shared their experiences. Secondly, an update on how I’ve been: I took today off of work, I’m a teacher at a daycare and I just didn’t think I had it in me. As one commenter said I should expect, I started having weird memories bubble up. Nothing major, just weird little instances like how I just… didn’t like my uncle one day or how I’ve had nightmares about him doing explicit things with me (they’ve always been one of my most frequent nightmares). I feel like I’m in shock, or maybe I’m dissociating somewhat— I don’t really feel anything right now, it’s just numbness. But, I do have a good support in my fiancé and friends, so I will be safe as I work through these feelings.

"I don't remember mine, either. I just remember getting UTIs all of the time, my dad getting frustrated about me having to go to the doctor all of the time for them (he was the abuser), and having to sleep in his bed with him in a really dark and scary room when I was really little. He and my mom slept in different beds. 

I went to therapy after I talked to my husband about everything I went through when I was little. My husband is a mandated reporter, so he immediately knew. Talked about it a little with my therapist, and then I had a dream one night. In my dream, I was around 4 or 6 years old. In my dream, a man in a white t-shirt grabbed me from behind and held me down. He squeezed so tight that my chest cracked. My mom was looking for me and frantic that she couldn't find me. And then I woke up.

I still don't remember anything that actually happened, but I have way too many signs to ignore. It doesn't help that my dad was a known child rapist. He died before he could ever be convicted. My older sister told me plenty of what he did to her and my other sisters as well. My older brother cried when he told me that he knew what my dad did to me and begged me to forgive him for not protecting me.

"PLEASE speak to a therapist. Many childhood sexual abuse survivors repress our trauma as a coping mechanism. It's not going to be comfortable, but for your own sake, it is something you should do. If he has those pictures you were a victim of sexual abuse, it's hard to know how far that abuse went, it might have stopped at pictures, but it might have gone further as well.  


On the surface, it feels like the best thing to do is just leave the memory buried so you don't have to face it, but even when it's repressed it DOES effect you in ways you probably won't realize until you explore it.

I was sexually abused as a kid. There are long swaths of my childhood where I don't remember anything. I've been through a lot of things besides that that I do remember. I started going to therapy to deal with the issues I do remember. While dealing with the emotions of the things I do remember, suddenly memories of things I didn't remember that were unpleasant started coming back. Some of the things were pretty bad. My therapist said it's normal for kids to not remember traumas, it's a coping mechanism so our brains can move on. But like you, the person that did the abuse was someone I just never liked. I never had a reason to not like him either, then suddenly one day my brain just unlocked the memory of the abuse. I tell you this not to push you to deal with it now or anything just to be prepared that that is something that happens as well. And when it happened to me, it about took me to my knees.

My dad was in a really bad place mentally and didn't really know what was going on at the time. Point being my two younger sisters were the same age as the girls this guy had raped.

"As a CSA survivor this is my advice. 

Please follow up with Victim Resources and accept any help they offer you. It might not feel necessary now but you're still in shock and this stuff tends to come on gradually until its suffocating once the floodgates have been opened. They will be very familiar with how this impacts a person and understand that although you may not feel like you need someone immediately it's worthwhile having someone there regardless. 

Secondly I'm not sure what the options are over there (I'm in the UK) but trauma informed therapy has been an absolute life saver. I was luckily able to register with a charity that specialises in men and boys that have experienced sexual abuse/trauma, and their knowledge and support literally saved my life. Please look into whether you're able to get therapy as soon as possible, again even if you don't feel like you need it straight away.  This stuff creeps up on you once you know it's there.

I think RAINN puts it at 1 out of every 9 of us before age 18, but I’m positive it’s more common than that even. Knowing it’s possible to completely forget the trauma messes my head up. I feel violated already without even having conformation. My uncle waited until I was alone then groped my breasts and confessed his sexual attraction to me when I was 22. My parents are groomers that encouraged him. Evil is in my family. I easily could’ve been molested too and just forgot it huh? I don’t even want to get out of bed in the morning.

"Hi, I’m in Australia and something similar happened to my family. A lodger living in our granny flat out the back was secretly filming all sorts of stuff, including us kids when we were naked in the paddling pool out back. He only got caught for a related incident 15 years later and then thousands of hours of footage was discovered in his current home. My mum was contacted by a friend after she saw my mum’s photo (a video still from the 90s/2000s) through a Facebook ‘crime stoppers’ post looking for people of interest to certain cases.

Anyway, it was quite a shock to the family. I felt fine because I don’t remember any of this happening. I didn’t feel violated. But my sister who’s 3 years older was traumatised. My parents were very upset, obviously. My mum had to travel to another city to assist with the case, and my family had to provide receipts and proof to help date the video tapes (which impacted on what age range of crime he’d be charged with).

Anyway, the guy went to prison for several years! Then I saw him at a shopping centre one day about 8 years ago. He hid from me."	just_quagsire	reply	na	na	na	0.02291526459157467	weak	strong	no	na	offmychest	failed

A friend of mine had a very similar experience but with her grandpa.. she just always felt uncomfortable around him for as long as she could remember, but didn’t understand why until about 2 years ago (when she turned 30) she had a flood of memories come back and it all clicked. It was tough to process through but she did and is okay now.

When I was 3 and 4 apparently my dad used to take me to his friend’s house when he would wanna hang out. On a couple occasions when my mom had class and my dad was off he would offer to babysit me (not my brother who was 11 months younger). I don’t remember ANYTHING about this man or that he even existed. My mom was in law school and they used real cases for class. His (dad’s friend) was a case someone was studying in her class. My mom asked how much my dad knew that this guy was a pedo. My dad said “I knew he did time…” my dad refuses to tell me ANYTHING about this guy, says my mom and I made him up (just lime with everything he likes to deny). My mom is keeping stuff to herself but she is much better at hiding things. I think something happened with him and my brain blocked it as a way to cope. I think a similar thing happened to you, OP. It really really sucks but with therapy I learned to embrace the fact that my brain blocked it and I suffered no other permanent damage.

"I don't know that I can say anything worthwhile as someone who hasn't experienced that specifically, but I have definitely other huge early childhood trauma: my dad developed paranoid schizophrenia, then pretty extreme alcoholism around when I was a toddler in a futile attempt to self medicate it, all of which only to get better with lots of treatment, only then die pretty quickly of cancer discovered when it was already terminal.

So, I do still just want to say I know that alone absolutely impacted me deeply, my entire life, and I also blocked out certain things, which even at *nearly 40* have only kind of come back. A lot of the ways it impacted me, now in near ""middle age"" also unfortunately really messed up some of my closest relationships, up to and including probably losing the person I considered the love of my life (or, if that wasn't love, I can't imagine what actually is).

">It's okay to feel that way, but I want you to know that you are not to blame even if you're thinking ""if i had only told someone about this that this wouldn't have been happening"". You were young at the time. Just remember that. You had no idea what was happening. Please don't blame yourself at all.

I second that. Additionally, considering the rate of how poorly family members react on average to abuse revelations by other family members, there’s unfortunately a very high probability that telling anybody in your family at your age back then would’ve been met with unbelief or blame and left you revictimized. That doesn’t make it right and he should’ve been held accountable long ago, but your decision as a victim whether or not to tell is nobody’s to make or judge but your own.

"I recently realized that I've been dealing with bullying at school since I was 5. I wasn't, and still am not, very smart, and people teased me for it.

I changed schools, but they continued to harass me at the new one. I was too naive, and people took advantage of me and hurt me. When I was ten years old, I believed that all adults were trustworthy and never lied. Why would they? That's how deep my naivety went.

In high school, the bullying got worse. They no longer mocked my stupidity, now it was about my appearance. They teased me for being skinny, pale, having red hair, and looking like a girl. I remember a classmate saying he'd rather I were dead than see me every morning. And whenever I had a positive interaction in class, things would escalate into bullying, and I'd end up crying while everyone stared at me as if I were insane.

Now I get nervous around teenagers. In my current social life, I'm just a weirdo. My family noticed that I seem scared when doing simple things like paying at the supermarket or talking to strangers. I'm embarrassed to go outside, go on vacation, or visit places. I'm aware that my body isn't normal, high school constantly reminded me of that. I don't know what happened to my puberty, but it seems to have regressed. My voice never changed, people mistake me for a toddler on the phone, and my waist is unlike other guys, it's very thin, making my hips appear wide. People often mistake me for a woman, even a homeless man recently harassed me on the street, wanting to ""flirt"" with me, I'm even afraid of other men. I feel like a disgusting weirdo.

I can't do everyday things like others can. I'm frightened and feel strange. I'm unsure if I was bullied because of how I am or if I'm this way because of the bullying. I despise victimizing myself, it disgusts me. But I truly hate not being normal. I'm angry why everyone treated me like this? Sometimes I think I kind of deserved it, but sometimes it makes me angry because I wasn't a bad kid."

The way people treated you is reflection of them, not a reflection of who you are. There's also nothing wrong with how you look and you should've never been bullied for that. I'm sorry you went through that. But I'd suggest talking to your parents about going to see a therapist. 

I was bullied in elementary and middle school, and I didn't have a safe situation at home either. I had a very traumatic experience with a friend in middle school. This resulted in me being very anxious as adult, but not only that - I kept having bad experiences with people, which made me feel like there's something wrong with me. It turns out I just had such low confidence, no sense of self-worth at all, which resulted in me not knowing to set boundaries and walk away when people didn't treat me right. I was also so very easily manipulated and kept blaming myself for what's happening to me. 

So, I repeat, nothing is wrong with you and none of what happened to you is your fault. However, going to a therapist will help you process everything that happened to you and learn how to cope, move on from it and heal. You deserve to feel safe going out and be treated nicely. So sorry you had to go through this, but please remember that what happened to you doesn't define you and your worth."

My neurologist, I just love this guy, he does way more than it belongs to his specialization, got me through pretty much every medication that could help, including opioids and experimental stuff. Right now I take 7 different everyday pills, injections once a month and the opioids when needed. Today I'm supposed to start another pill, to let me sleep and stop the Restless Legs Syndrome. I recently lost two toenails and dislocated a toe because of it 🙃 not even counting the bruises and scratches. He said it will definitely help, though I should refrain from drinking anything in the evening because I could literally oversleep a pee. Honestly, I don't even care, as long as I get at least 4 hours of uninterrupted sleep.

I just need to get this off my chest. The past several times I’ve attempted to initiate sex, my husband has said no. Im fine with this, as I feel a relationship and a marriage is about more than just sex, and obviously consent is independent of our relationship. I’m not owed sex just because I’m his wife. Cool, fine. However, I went onto his computer today to finish up some documents I need for work (mine was completely dead, I just needed to edit one or two things, he is at work) and I accidentally closed the wrong tab on the internet browser I was using. I went to open it back up with the history tab, and at the bottom of the history tab (from the past few nights) were a bunch of porn games. Was I wrong to snoop and go through all of those? Maybe. But there were pages and pages of him searching for porno games. Pages of stuff that I found where they’re “cheating” games (where you play a game as someone and you’re cheating on your partner in game) among things like “mom got stuck in the washing machine!” And whatever else. Now. I don’t think he’s cheating on me, honestly he has no time and I do have his location so I could, at least theoretically, check his location at any time. (I generally don’t unless it’s past time for him to be home and he’s not read or replied to texts, and I want to make sure he’s okay) and I know, I know. It’s just stupid games and what is essentially porn, it’s not like he’s chatting up local women available for sex. And I get the whole “sex vs masturbation” thing. I just…. I don’t know. It’s kind of hurtful that I ask for sex, he turns me down, and then goes into the next room and masturbates. This has been a problem before. I’ve brought it up before, that I feel hurt when he does stuff like this. He left all the porn discords he was in, he stopped playing the games for awhile, and now…. We’re back to that I guess. He’s joined another porn discord where people post their nudes and stuff in there. He’s not talking to anybody as far as I can see/tell, but I dunno. This all just really hurts.

"
It's understandable that you're feeling hurt and frustrated by the situation. Communication is key in any relationship. Have an open and honest conversation with your husband about your feelings, concerns, and the impact of his actions on you. It's important to express how his behavior makes you feel and to listen to his perspective as well. Try to find a compromise that respects both of your needs and boundaries. If the issue persists, you might consider seeking couples therapy to work through these challenges together. Remember, addressing the problem calmly and respectfully can help pave the way for a healthier and more understanding relationship."

"OP, your story makes me feel like I’ve tuned in when the show is half over. Can you take us to the beginning please?

What happened, originally? Why did he start to withhold sex? Sounds like a passive-aggressive response to something, but to what? 

I’ll say this much - no matter the reason, his actions make him look pathetic. If he is dissatisfied with you in some way, he should be talking to you about it. Not doing the stupid dance of pulling back affection. And if it’s at that point where he feels like he’s tried, failed and gave up, then why is he still hanging around? 

I wish that people would stop apologizing and feeling guilty for snooping. You had a gut feeling, and you followed it. It would be dumb to ignore it. You did nothing wrong.

Let him play the games! But be firm about the discord. A guy is gonna do what he wants, but don’t try and dictate or control what he does. He probably feels smothered over that cause of you telling him you’re hurt over playing too much video games… a man needs an outlet for stress and taking away something is considered healthy isn’t fair.

My problem is that we have had many conversations about this, I’ve told him several times that I feel hurt and like he gives more attention to the games and the discords. He has even agreed with me that it was taking up too much time and he told me (note: he told me. I had told him at the time that I was fine with him using them just I’d prefer that he decreased the time he spent on them and give me some form of attention at least once or twice a week, he said no I’ll stop altogether and then did for about 8 months now.

Okay. So. We’ve been married for almost 2 years now. I’d say about a year into our marriage is when I started seeing a lot of the porn games and the porn discords. At first it didn’t really bother me so much, because while I was uncomfortable with the amount of time spent on the games (he played for several weeks straight, every night) we were having a ton of sex, so. I didn’t really feel like I had a right to complain. And then about 4/5 months later, is when sex kind of fell by the wayside at the time. I ended up going on his computer at that time and looking, because tbh, the way he was acting made me feel like there was more to it than just porn, I became concerned about cheating. I spoke up, said I was upset by the amount of time spent on the game, and that I had been looking through the discords and said that I didn’t like the fact that he was in numerous porn discords. I told him I didn’t even really mind that he did it, but that I just…. Wanted it to be less time and maybe give me a little more attention and possibly up our sex life. It was at that time that he told me he would stop. He left porn discords, deleted all the porn games on his computer, the whole shebang. Our sex life greatly improved. We were having sex for the past 7/8 months almost every day at points, but at least twice a week. I think he started withholding about a week/week and a half ago. So it’s not been a super long time, but it’s a drastic change from where we were just at. And then when I stumbled across the history today, it’s been about two weeks that he’s been searching for and downloading large amounts of porn games. He has also joined at least one (that I can see, I’m not sure if you can hide discord channels because I don’t use discord) porn discord, and I’m not sure about when he joined that. As far as I’m aware, i don’t think anything really serious happened, outside of some family drama from the in laws, but that didn’t really affect us much. It was just some dumb drama between his sisters and aunt. I keep racking my brain, but I can’t think of any arguments, or really anything he could be upset about. We don’t really fight, we generally talk everything out. I have been a bit moodier lately, so maybe that’s it? I just changed birth controls, but that was within the last week, I don’t know why almost two weeks ago.

For some people, even me, playing games helping me escape reality/real world. So I can see why he spends most of his time on games. In situations like this, it might be helpful to have a focused and serious discussion about the matter (again), emphasizing the impact it has on your relationship and your emotions. You could express your disappointment and concern about the promises not being kept, and seek to understand his perspective on why he went back to those habits. Try to identify any underlying reasons for his behavior and work together to find a solution that respects both of your needs. If these efforts don't lead to a resolution, you may want to consider seeking the guidance of a professional relationship counselor or therapist to facilitate the conversation and provide guidance on how to move forward. Remember, both partners need to be committed to making positive changes for the relationship to improve.

This can go on for so long though. Eventually something’s gotta give. If he sees that she is feeling neglected and not loved wouldnt it make more sense for him to just spend a little more time on his marriage instead of games/porn?

"There’s this narrative that tolerance is enough, that being non-antagonistic is fine, and that just not talking about it is better. Tolerance just isn’t enough; it just proves time and time again that the unconditional love we were promised had unspoken conditions. Tolerance is not the same as acceptance, it’s not taking the time to recontextualize how you knew your child or even an attempt to understand them better. Tolerance is alienating and lonely.

I’m glad you had the strength to decide to cut them off and live your life, but I also understand that it still hurts. Having to come to terms with the fact that your parents love their ideal version of who you should be more than you can be hard- I’ve had to do that myself with my mom… I got lucky enough to have a cool dad.

Ever since I was a child I’ve had issues with people touching me. I get so upset even if the person didn’t mean to and they accidentally brush against me in anyway. It makes me skin crawl and I hate it. During my teens it got better but I entered a horrible relationship. I was sexually abused in that relationship and since then the feeling has intensified to the point where I don’t even accept hugs like I used to from my mother. Sometimes even hugging her makes my skin crawl so bad and it makes me sad. I have a daughter and thankfully she is the only one who I don’t mind having constant physical contact. There have been a few times where I’ve been severely overwhelmed and can not handle her touching me and that hurts. How can I make these feelings go away? I think for the most part I’m good at dealing with it but some days it’s so hard. Unless I initiate the hug or any physical contact that isn’t sexual, I can’t handle it. And sometimes when I do initiate it I can’t deal with it as well as I hoped. I just want to be able to hug my siblings and my parents without feeling so grossed out and physically ill or the feelings of my sick crawling. I hate this feeling.

"Part of it is probably mental. I was like that since I was a small child, partly because I'm autistic and likely also from being abused. I was able to overcome it for the most part, although it did get worse temporarily after sexual assaults. 

You might have to go to therapy and talk about what's making you feel that way. I never had issues with my kids touching me, just adults. I'm not sure what I did to get over it, I suppose I just decided I wasn't going to be bothered by it. I still have severe sensory issues with touch but I can tolerate people touching me. 

If you're getting into a panic when you're touched that's probably what's causing it. If you're expecting it to bother you and making it into a big thing it's going to make it worse. You could try breathing exercises and other methods to calm anxiety and that should help."	FarEntertainer193	reply	na	na	na	0.9948425889015198	no	strong	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.

This is exactly why I hate being the smart kid. Everyone in my class expects me to be perfect, and if I make a mistake, or get something wrong, “ooos” follow. It is just a game of expectations at this point.

Yesterday was my birthday and so many people in my life just completely forgot about it. I don’t normally care too much about my birthday and I don’t make a big deal out of it, but I always make a point to let people know I’m thinking of them on their birthday so they feel important and cared about, and to know that I apparently don’t even deserve an acknowledgment has kind of depressed me a little. At the beginning of this year I wasn’t sure if I’d even still be here for another birthday, so it kind of felt like an important milestone for me.

"I'm 26M. My parents and I have an agreement: I get to stay at home to work on my goal of finding success following my own path, instead of helping them at our family shop. In exchange for this, I cook, clean the house, buy groceries, and many other chores. Unfortunately, I haven't found success yet for the past 4 years, although I do think I'm getting close. 

The problem? My sister (25F) treats me with superiority because she has a job, while I don't. She lives in another city, but whenever she comes back, she often criticizes me for not having accomplished anything, for not having given up on my goals and gone outside to find a job, and for all sorts of things.

Just yesterday, my Mum offered to clean my room's windows while I was studying and learning something I needed. I told her that I had planned to clean the next day, but I gladly accepted her offer. My sister saw that, and later, when my Mum wasn't around, asked me for an explanation. ""Why were you idly sitting there like a loafer while Mum was doing the cleaning?"", she said. 

""Well, I was studying. Mum offered to clean the windows herself, so I accepted"", I said.

""Oh come on! You call that studying? You should have helped Mum, at least when she was in your room! Come on, seriously! You're just... ugh""

""Why are you talking like that? It's not like I don't do anything all day. I mean, I'm the one always cooking and cleaning the house and buying groceries. This time Mum was just doing me a favor...""

""I'm not saying you're completely useless, but you *are* a little.""

The discussion ended there because my Mum came back to my room to ask me how to set something up on her phone.

Over the past year, my sister has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't see me as an equal. She believes that me doing all the cooking and cleaning and other chores so that our parents and herself don't have to doesn't mean much, so long as I am not contributing money to the family.

And on top of it all, she has no problem using me as her personal taxi driver when she goes out with her group of friends, without ever giving me a heads up, forcing me to reorganize my schedule. If I tell her to ask one of her friends to give her a ride, she says that she doesn't want to inconvenience them. If I try to protest and say that she's inconveniencing me by forcing me to wait to pick her up late in the night, despite knowing that I like to wake up early in the morning to work on my things, she'll just say ""What do you have to do, anyway?"" and ""Not like you have a job or anything"".

I don't know how to deal with this anymore. I am working hard, I really am. I also feel guilty for not making money, but it's not like I'm ""loafing"", like she says. I'm repaying my parents' kindness by doing all the chores because they have to work at our shop all day. But apparently I'm not worth much unless I'm making money..."

"‚Obligatory English is not my first language so excuse any mistakes’ 


So I had really long hair. It was down to my waist. I went to a new salon (I recently moved) and I told the hairstylist I wanted a trim, showed her how much of my hair she can cut and I showed her a spot on my stomach where I want my hair to reach (about a few centimeters above my belly button). I also told her that I always put my hair in a long braid. She agreed and washed my hair and started cutting.. and cutting. And at the same time talking my ears off. I‘m not really comfortable with small talk so I just listened and occasionally did like the classic ‚aha, ok wow‘. And before I know it, my long hair is gone. It barely reaches my armpits now. Doesn’t even go past my boobs. 

First of all, I hate this length on my hair. 
Second, and that’s the worst for me: I have a one year old son who absolutely loved to play with my long braid. Was our ritual while nursing or every night putting him to bed. Not only did she cut 2/3 of my hair off without even asking, she took all those precious moments with my son away from me. If I put what‘s left of my hair in a braid, it hardly goes past my shoulders. 

What’s making me so angry is, that this could not have been a mistake. This wasn‘t like a ‚oops I got carried away and accidentally took 2 more centimeters‘. She cut more than 30cm off my hair. Completely ignoring that I was there for a trim. I am utterly devastated. More so because my son can‘t play with my braid anymore. The thing is, I was so in shock when I realised it after she finished cutting, I couldn’t say anything (I know, I know, coward…) and I told myself I‘m sure I‘m overreacting and it isn‘t that bad. But as soon as I got home and saw myself in the mirror I just cried. 


Now, maybe there is a hairstylist who could answer this for me: I know there is nothing I can do at this point, the hair is gone. 
However, I thought about emailing the salon just to explain this and let them know how upset I am. I don‘t even want my money back or anything. Just to say that I‘m not ok with how I was treated. Is this a childish thing? She probably will not give a shit anyway but maybe I will find some peace within myself. 

I know this sounds overly dramatic because of some cut hair but I really am heartbroken that I cannot have these moments with my son anymore."	JanineTheMachine	post	29.396704281745016	female	White	0.9994848966598511	na	na	na	2	offmychest	failed

"I (17m) am in love with my cousin (18f) for the past year. It happened last year when i had gone back to my home country and she also came back since we both live in differnt countries and we super rarely meet up. We usually whn we were kids wud always be mad at each other and did not like each other fr stupid reasons, but whn we meet properly this time, we took a long moment to talk abt things life, school. We deeply bonded with each other and i knew something was different but cudnt put a mind to it. btw, all of this took place only fr 10days. i never had a female friend let alone a female person around my age around me and she felt different. The moment i knew whn i fell in love was whn it was the last night before i had to leave back to my home and so did she. It was just me and her outside the house by a bench just talkin abt stuff, suddenly she put her head on my shoulder and asked if i minded, i was like "" No not at all"" but in fact my heart was racin non stop and thn she grabbed my arm and held it tight. By thn i also put my head on top of her head and we were in tht position fr around 10mins or so but fr me it felt like an eternity. Eventually our parents called us both to go back inside the house to sleep and we did. Next day it went on as usually fr her but my view on her was different fr me. Eventually i had to say goodbyes to everyone and especially her and when i went towards her to give her a handshake, she went on fr a hug , i was caught off and my heart was racing, i knew at tht moment that it was my first love comin into bloosom. we shared contacts with each other before leaving and we kept the contact by talkin to each other everyday growing closer until she started gettin distance with me. By then i knew tht i was doin is wrong and nw is the chance to also get distance with her so, so did i too. Our messages became shorter and shorter too single lines. and she started leavin my messages on read fr days and until out of nowhere she replies and i asked myself tht if she is not interested in talkin to me, dont reply back. But she didnt evn though she grew apart. It hurt me pretty bad but i knew tht it had to come to this.  
And now comes back to the present where i came back to my homecountry one last time be4 i enroll fr my college back at my home. Her dad was also here since she was apparently gonna study at my home country but not in the state as where we lived and i was like hmm okay but out of nowhere my dad and her dad decided on meetin her one last time be4 her dad also leaves back home and i was caught off by surprise. all the memories of the past started floodin in, i was not thinking straight asking myself wht to do, since im gonna meet her i knew fr a fact tht i will be hurt again but this time far worser. I prepared myself fr the worst, makin myself cold and talkin less, but knwin her i knew tht it wudnt work and it didnt. i met her again whn i thought tht the last time i met her was the final until we became proper adults but it wasnt. i gave bein cold but she managed to melt my ice in the heart and nw my mind is flooded with her and im leavin back to my home knwin tht there is a high chance i will never get to see her again until it is few years and wht if it is too late.

My advice is not to be single-minded. Think hard, Love is not the only thing in life. You may need to talk to your cousin about your feelings even if she would find you weird if you say it, a discussion about that between you two could possibly clear your mind and make you see reason. If not that then a therapist can go a long way. Since I am no expert.	Rich-Cup-9882	reply	na	na	na	0.002308271359652281	weak	no	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.

"2 years ago my mother passed away. She died the day before my birthday. I will never forget her last words to me. She said, ""I hate you. You didn't keep your promise."" 
It was a promise I made at the age of 10, when she became terminally ill. She made me promise  to always take care of her until she died. A promise of which, I kept until she was forced to go into hospice her final few days.
Over the last 2 years I've reflected on how she treated me and my siblings. My siblings are much older than me, and until recently I never understood why they distanced themselves from her. Our mother was a narcissist and a pathological liar. 
She would constantly pit me against the other siblings in an effort to make them look like the asshole. My siblings weren't perfect, but her descriptions of them were greatly exaggerated. She blamed them for her bankruptcy, and would attack them on a personal level. 
2 of my siblings suffer from mental disorders, while 1 of them is handicap. While the handicap sibling is considered bad news, there was never an ounce of love shown when speaking about them. She would berate them, call them ""useless members of society"" while talking to me. However, to their face, she would act the motherly part. 
Another of my siblings is very well off, financially speaking. They were the one she constantly blamed for losing the house. Comparing them to their ""useless father"" constantly. Any time she spoke to them, she would attempt to put them down about their past. As if their current accomplishments meant nothing. 
Then we get to me... My mother acted the part well enough throughout my childhood. It wasn't until I turned into a teenager/young adult that she began to view me similarly to my siblings. I was very sheltered and anti-social. I never got along with others, was fat, and a bit of a crybaby until I hit Junior High. That was around the time that I begged her to see a psychiatrist because I knew something wasn't right with me. I'd been diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression. My mother took the news pretty hard, and compared me to my other siblings who had disorders and her motherly act wore off. 
She would constantly berate me, calling me a fat ass, and telling me that no one would ever like me because I was ""broken."" It eventually got to the point where I attempted to take my own life at the age of 15 by overdosing on her pills (she stockpiled them, convinced that the doctors would eventually cut her off). I instead just overdosed on opioids, and eventually came back to the realm of the living almost 2 days later. She never noticed, and I never said anything. 
After that, I began to try to better my health. Both mentally and physically. I lost 70lbs, and began to make friends. I even managed to get off my medication. 
Eventually, I got a girlfriend. My mom hated her. Claimed she ""carried the Devil's energy with her."" After a few months of her hounding me, I broke up with my girlfriend. This cycle would continue a few more times until I was 17. 
There was a girl who I was friends with. I personally never had romantic feelings for this girl. However, my mom loved her because she would assist with all of her needs. I personally compared the girl to a puppy on multiple occasions. When my mother would ask me to assist her, this girl would jump at the opportunity. Eventually, my mother talked me into dating this girl. Again, I had no romantic feelings for her. Eventually she moves in with us, and assists with the caretaking. 
Over the next year, our relationship begins to become rocky. My mother would consistently berate this girl, making fun of her appearance, and her ""housewife skills."" Any time I would defend her, my mother would threaten to call the cops on me and have me charged for abuse of the elderly/terminally ill. Eventually, the girl became extremely cold towards me. I didn't know why until I looked through my mother's messages on her phone YEARS later.
My mother convinced this girl that I was a cheater. I wasn't. Even though I didn't love her, I believed in loyalty. Eventually, I found out she had been cheating on me as retaliation after I snooped her phone. She left the next day.
The rest of my relationships, my mother would sabotage. Whether it was telling my friends that she's a bad fit for me. Messaging the girl, or her family, to stay away from me. She would even go as far as to threaten them when I was in another room. 
Eventually, I stopped trying with relationships. I felt bound to my mother via my promise to her that I had made over a decade ago. I was slightly combative towards her remarks and abuse, but stayed by her side. 
When 2021 came I was at a breaking point. I was forced to drop out of college, and quit my job to take care of her. I hadn't slept in a bed in months, and could only sleep for 2 hours at a time before she woke me up again to do something as simple as grab an ice cube for her water. 
During that year, she took a downward spiral. She was unable to walk and was bound to a wheelchair. At one point she became delirious, and started mentioning REALLY weird shit. Like the kind of stuff people with Alzheimer's or Dementia say. I immediately panicked and called 911. She refused to go the first time I called, and kind of went back to normal for 12-ish hours. I managed to sleep the entire night, which immediately set off a red flag. I checked on her, and she was in the same state as the night before - I called 911 again and she went with them. 
She was in the hospital for 2 weeks in a medically induced coma, eventually she awoke but was still acting strange. The doctors explained to me that she was suffering from Biventricular Heart Failure and maybe had a week to live. Her echocardiogram from the year prior indicated that nothing was wrong. 
She got moved to hospice, and I visited her every day. One minute she would be telling me how much she loved me for ""putting up with her all these years."" The next minute she was, ""disappointed in me for not having a family.""
It eventually came to a head the day before she died. She explained to me that she never really loved me. She only kept me around so she could be taken care of. She ended it with, ""I hate you. You didn't keep your promise."" I walked out of the room, and she began screaming my name. I was crying in the waiting area when a nurse asked me if she could sedate her because she was disrupting the other people's final moments. I said yes.
She passed the day before my birthday, and I felt like shit. I immediately went through her things. Just to find some comfort. When I finally reached her phone, I went through her messages just to see what she said about me. Every single one was putting me or my siblings down in private. I found the messages that she sent to sabotage my relationships. I found the messages she sent to my siblings on how I would fail in life and end up as a drug addict. 
My birthday was spent crying, grieving, and hating her. The next day was spent throwing a party on my newfound freedom and the death of that witch."	Majestic-Race4157	post	20.38737097457448	male	White	0.9938420057296753	na	na	na	6	offmychest	no prediction.

The title basically says it all. As a kid I (26f) loved to steal snacks in the middle of the night from the kitchen. The door to my bedroom was too big for the frame and in an attempt to stop me from getting up every night, my parents would slam the door as hard as possible so it would get jammed in the doorframe. Me being 3-5 years (happened for a couple years til we moved) old couldn’t get it open most of the time. I had this little pink plastic comb set I used to wedge into the door to pry it open and it kinda worked for a while until it snapped in half. After it snapped I was never able to get the door open so I couldn’t use the bathroom for the entire night. I started collecting bags (mostly paper bags if I remember correctly) and shitting in the bags and hiding it behind my dresser or bed. My room was already messy but I remember my parents helping me clean it a few months later and I was terrified waiting for the blow up when they found them all but they never said a word about the bags and to this day nobody has ever brought it up. I didn’t even remember about this until a few days ago when a mom friend of mine said it took 3 of the big black construction bags to clean her sons room up and suddenly I was 5 again back in my bedroom cleaning being so scared of what my parents would do when they found the bags only for nothing to happen. I don’t wanna tell anyone IRL cuz it’s so gross, not even my siblings but just needed to say it.

"I hate myself for it now, but when I was younger, I had basically ruined my relationship with my parents and the entire family due to me being a dumbass, So I had to look for validation in other places. 
At first, it wasn't that bad. I just looked up chat rooms on a software store and one of the top rated one was similar to an Omegle random chat. At first it was okay. Mostly talking to one person after being skipped by 100's of people, but that changed when people started asking questions about my age before my gender, which I said I was the age I was, and they would be a lot more interested. 
At first, I just felt so.. valided I guess would be the word for it after like half a year of non stop fights with my family and my parents not being home 90% of the time, it felt like I was genuinely enjoyed, loved even, so I did it. I did it more and more times until I eventually worked my way up to a chat room online that is the worst pit of the internet. It was basically free riegn with people asking for people underaged with the moderation team being absent 99% of the time, but I digres. It just kept getting fueled, with me doing It with more and more people, and it was at the point probably 100s of people had my nude pictutes doing stuff i regret to tthis day.

I try not to think about it  because of the effects it has on my mentality but it has been popping up a lot and I just needed a place to confess ig.

There is no need in bringing someone into existence just so they struggle to maintain this stupid cycle. If it were my choice humans would stop reproducing and end suffering. Why bring someone here just so they can grow up and be a slave for money their whole life? And then they get to die. Life is not worth the struggle and anyone not born is spared of suffering and death. I just don’t see how humans rationalize bringing someone into this life to inevitably suffer a great deal.


Edit: viewpoints on life are subjective. I thought that was a given but obviously not. My argument is that in life, most people will suffer more than prosper. So why bring new people in?

Edit #2: Yes, a persons life can have subjective meaning but it doesn’t change the fact that on a the grand scale they are an animal that will die and be forgotten and everything they do on this earth will eventually be for nothing. This is a pointless existence because we aren’t serving a purpose outside of our own subjective opinion and ideas.

Edit #3: A lot of you are getting the impression that I’m sad, or depressed. This realization about life doesn’t make me sad. I am indifferent to it. I know this life is pointless so there isn’t a point to getting sad over it. I am arguing you could spare another person the suffering by not bringing them here. But for most of you I guess bringing someone in to fight for survival, just to die anyway, is great because they get to watch Netflix and play tag. 

Regardless, on my deathbed I will know that I had the courage to look at life objectively even when the truth isn’t pleasant. I look at life in the eyes. I settled on truth and not what makes me feel good. 

Reality at base level is organisms eating each other alive. The only thing happening on this earth is evolution and reproduction. There is no goal to meet. Nowhere to go.

Some people have great lives, or some people suffer a lot but still find value in who they become.

Your projection is palpable. Maybe look up what it means to project and dismiss the ideas of others while holding your own in a superior position. Sounds like some narcissism is in there. This is marked by your seemingly inability to accept other viewpoints as valid as your own and thus 'stupid'. Something as highly variable and incomprehensibly diverse such as life itself doesn't lend itself to a 'one sized fits all' perspective. You sound uninitiated in many ways to what life has to offer. Your receptiveness being so closed points to this. Suffering is a part of life but not the primary one for many people for much of their lives.

">how do you rationalize bringing someone into this existence?

You don't have to rationalize it. We're animals, we mate, we make offspring. We're born and we die. That is our condition. I rationalize having kids as much as I rationalize breathing oxygen or drinking water, as in, I don't.

It's all the stuff you do in between that matters. Life isn't your thoughts or your feelings, it's the things you do, the connections you make, the places you visit. If you're not doing anything, and instead sitting around brooding on reddit, no shit you don't see a point in this existence.

I'll admit, I've been stuck in a very cynical headspace. I still think that I have a lot more love for humans than most people I talk to. There's a lot of paranoia out there, lots of people feeling like *other people* and their choices are the enemy.

Anyway, what I wanted to say was. The original point of society was to protect ourselves from nature right? To give the group a better chance of survival.

But haven't we replaced that with *far* greater dangers and lasting suffering? Lions aren't out committing SA or pedophilia. They might eat the kids, but I'd argue that's way easier for a family/community to cope with.

Idk, I'm not saying anything new. We've known that humans are scarier than nature (even tho we are nature). I just feel like the fears we've created for ourselves kind of counteract the whole point of coming together in the first place.

I was focusing so much attention on macro level stuff like the meaning and purpose of life, wanting recognition, wanting to leave a legacy, wanting to be something bigger than I was, while completely missing all the micro level stuff, the day to day, friendships, relationships, the simple things in life, you know? I was too judgemental about it, like ""oh, everyone does this stuff, there's nothing special about it,"" and by doing that I completely tossed the baby out with the bathwater and set myself up for misery. I spent more time thinking about *life* than thinking about *my life* and rather than living it.

It's like, have you ever been playing a game, like let's say an RPG, and you're playing the game and having fun, but then you stop for a moment and are suddenly aware of the game loop, that you're essentially doing the same thing over and over, just with different stats, different equipment, in different locations, and it suddenly isnt fun anymore? It's a lot like that...the fun is in playing the game and getting lost in the moment, not thinking about what the point of playing the game is.

Along similar lines, I was fighting my circumstances a lot. Like, because I was focused on bigger stuff, I felt so basic and lame for working an office job, like it was pointless and sucking the life out of me. But I reached a point where I realized, I don't entirely hate my job, I actually get some enjoyment out of it, I like the people I work with, and it pays me well enough to be able to enjoy life outside of work, afford a place to live, etc. This took shifting my perspective and trying to grow out of the bitter and angsty teen that I hadn't fully grown out of yet.

Mindfulness meditation and Buddhism helped a lot. I've never formally practiced Buddhism but what it taught resonated with me and just made sense. Both of these provided a valuable framework for me. And if you're scientifically minded or a skeptic, then you should know that the effects of mindfulness meditation on stuff like anxiety has been studied and measured and there is scientific backing for it. It's helpful for dealing with anxiety, negative thoughts, and the negative feelings that come with it.

Psychedelic mushrooms help expand your mind and shift your perspective a lot too. They're illegal most places, and YMMV, but they're a very useful tool and I believe we're going to see them increasingly used in therapeutic settings in the future. We're already starting to. I can attest to their effectiveness in treating depression and anxiety. I'm not advising you to break the law but there's nothing wrong about educating yourself on how to handle them properly if you happened to find a bag of them on the sidewalk.

There's probably a whole lot more but those are some big things that could help. There really is just something magical about getting older, turning 30, and just having this shift in perspective that some shit really just doesn't matter at all, and it's a waste to spend any energy on it. There's this visceral realization that wow, I'm getting older, I'm not gonna be here forever, what am I *really* doing? Then at 40, you've had enough rotations around the sun to truly recognize a lot of different patterns, the cyclical and generational nature of things, that humans have kinda just been repeating the same form of things forever, just slightly different content in different contexts and locations, but we're all basically just made of the same shit and thus prone to all of the same behaviors, and we're not really that personally unique, and *that's OK*. It's humbling, and being humbled is a great way to grow and shed the bullshit."	he11bovnd	reply	na	na	na	0.012668908573687077	weak	no	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.
Didn't mean it in that way.

"I think you got the impression that I somehow agree with conservatives (???) but I just think it's a very interesting conversation to have. That's all,  I just tried to interpret (with clearer words) what they tried to imply...  
have all the sex you want, all the meals you want, and all the kids you want, as long as they are taken care of, I don't care, but in the meantime, what could we do with the ones that are parentless? I think that's an actual conservative sthought if we say ""theyre not mine, dont care"" could we all be selfish then? Again, not trying to fight or anything...

"""I want."" It is fulfilling your desire. How is that *not* selfish? You're the one getting upset because you take it as an attack, even though I've made it clear I'm not saying it's an inherently *bad* selfish act. It's still self-serving if it's fulfilling some desire.

If I'm feeling bad about myself, so I go serve at a community kitchen to feel better about myself. That's a good thing, but it's still self-serving. Especially if I only do it until I feel better.

Which is how I see (many) parents. Willing to bend over backwards and make themselves miserable to help *their children succeed,* but look at other people as barriers to their own children's success.

I don't even know what I'm saying here, but clearly all you parents are pretty sensitive about the fact that having a child is a self-serving act."	he11bovnd	reply	na	na	na	0.012668908573687077	no	no	strong	na	offmychest	no prediction.

"We have been together for a while (couple of years) and she had already transitioned when I met her.

Whenever I’ve seen older photos of her I’ve always looked away because it’s just not her. It sounds like her but it’s not her. Seeing her dead name on mail is really upsetting.

Tonight I just wanted to see them. She’s the one that told me they were there when we first started dating - it was part of a project she was involved with.

I feel so guilty, like I’ve betrayed her. I’m scared that I’ll accidentally misgender her or start seeing her differently. I also know I need to hold onto this and not share this with her, it would be for me to absolve myself of my guilt. So I’ll unload here instead."

"I don't think I could handle the idea of a partner having once been male like you've done, I don't know why but I don't think it's rampant bigotry, apologies if anyone thinks it is. I know it's not a hateful thing on my end and I think it possibly is quite natural for most straight men to have some sort of reaction to the idea/reservations to overcome in that situation, I just know for me I would be very conscious of it. I'm sympathetic to anyone born into that situation and I'm glad we've moved on to a more accepting society but maybe I'm still a dinosaur in my attitude, I honestly don't know but that's just coming from what I'd consider a fairly boring standard straight male to another.

You'll know if you had any of that at the beginning and obviously there is a reaction to her former life as you've mentioned that but you can't really be accused of being a bigot given you have been with her for years. It's worrying you so much it just sort of sounds like you're very loyal and you love her, like you very much don't want to have the kind of thoughts most people in your situation naturally would do and that doesn't make you a lousy person, you're more open-minded than the majority of us I would expect but sometimes even being open-minded takes work and I don't think you need feel bad for that."

"Know it's hard to hear this, but hope you take this as one of the greatest birthday gifts you shall ever receive. One day and so many answers to so many unasked questions.

Do you mean as much as you thought to your family? No, no you dont.

Did your friendship with your friends mean as much to them as it does to you? No, no it doesn't. 

As for your job, it just happened on your birthday. Jobs come, jobs go; very few only work one job their entire life.

You don't state your age, but it doesn't matter to be honest. Life lessons like this crush you at 16, 26, 36, etc. 

Hoping you decide to try your hardest to not allow this to crush you, but allow this to motivate you. Friends come and go, and your current ones need to go. As for your family, we'll nobody else will hurt or rip you off faster than family. 

Motivate yourself to start today, on your birthday, to make a plan to better yourself for yourself. Stay off drugs and alcohol as they will only make things worse. Motivate yourself into not just believing, but know without knowing that in the future you will have better friends, and a few can and hopefully will become your chosen family.

I'm sorry you are having a birthday that most only see in movies. Do not let this be end of, but a new start of your future.

Happy birthday. Times like this show you who really cares. This is a hard time, but a blessing in disguise. It may be hard, but find a new job that appreciates you and new friends may come along with it. It may take time too, but walking away from this part of your life will open new doors. It may be lonely, hang in there. Sometimes if you have just one or two friends that you could trust and know have your back, you are the luckiest person in the world. So many people are so selfish and narcissistic nowadays, SOOOO MANY. Be selective with who you associate with, and don’t help these people if they only come around when they need something.

"Happy birthday!

I second the suggestion to go to HR, especially if you have any sort of documentation from 3 weeks ago about taking the day off. This is a sucky way to learn to always, always get promises for time off, promotions, pay raises, schedule changes, etc in writing. If there's a union, call them up to join and they should be able to argue more effectively for you. Even if your job takes you back, I strongly suggest you search for a new one because the management here seems disorganized at best. Job hunting is easier while you're employed.

Hopefully, this is the start of better things to come. You came here to vent but got advice to stand up for yourself. Maybe you'll be able to move onto a healthier, more organized work environment. I'm sure you've experienced a lot of red flags at this job, so you're better prepared to spot them at your next one to know when to move on. Lots of people here care about your special day and want to wish you a great year ahead.

I'm sorry today was a bit of a letdown. Everyone deserves to be acknowledged. I know you said you're strapped, but I hope you're able to do something fun and nice for yourself."	Southern_Passage3614	reply	na	na	na	0.9994902610778809	weak	strong	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.

Here's what I've always done on my birthday: Deactivate my FB the day before and reactivate the day after. Then I don't pine over 'why did I only get 2 or 3 birthday wishes and nobody else cares?' I get zero and nobody even realized it passed.. and then life goes on as normal. Also I never take my birthday off from work.. and I don't say a word to anyone about it. The day goes on as normal. I used to have one annoying boss whom tracked everyone's birthdays. Needless to say, it always foiled my plan. But I thanked anyone who wished me 'happy birthday' nonetheless.

"The way I look at relationships of all kinds is ""I am who I am and if someone doesn't acknowledge me due to me being myself or they don't like attributes of me then GOOD. Because I truly would rather be alone then have a bunch of people pretending to like me while simultaneously putting parts of me down when I'm not looking"". 

I love my birthday, but enjoy it more when nobody harasses me over it lol and as far as jobs are concerned,  this is the BEST possible time to lose a job (in America) because no one is really ambitious right now about working. So you have the pick of the litter on jobs. Go get one you actually enjoy.

 From the sounds of your boss, you are better off not having that unstable volatile assclown in your life anyway. You don't want to have to wait around for a person like that to conveniently ""forget"" you asked for time off simply because they are petty and too small to admit that their behavior is wrong. Fuck that guy. 

But I get it. I would be very unhappy too. So with all that said, happy birthday. And keep in mind this one thing I've often noticed with people in our society. Usually the ones who are alone and abandoned by their peers are where they are because they have something that others do not. You go against the grain of what people like to see.

😁 I’m 27 on 24th! I keep forgetting my own birthday lol.  Well it sounds like unfair dismissal to me. I am in the UK though, however over here if your company was going to fire you they need HR present otherwise it’s illegal and the company could be sued. Maybe also try going above your boss’s head to his supervisor to see if he has the authority to just cut you off like that as over here, it’s actually HR’s decision.

I actually have an almost hilariously bad birthday story. My 18th birthday, my parents & grandparents went on a cruise without me. I had school that day, and planned on celebrating with my best friend and her family after school, as they were more like my family than my actual one. Their mom calls and tells them to come right home, so we assume they’re in trouble and were nervous the whole way there. Until we get there and find out one of their dogs suddenly passed of a heart attack a few hours earlier. We cried and cried, and eventually went out for ice cream to make ourselves feel better. My car broke down on the way home, I believe the serpentine belt had snapped or something like that. I was REALLY crying then. Had to wait hours for a tow truck and just went home and ended the day LMAO. Didn’t get any cake or any celebration really, it’s kinda funny now just how bad it was.

Very similar thing happened to my best friends boyfriend except HR was present, however usually you’re meant to have a disciplinary and be put on a performance plan THEN if it’s still not working they can sack you. If for whatever reason you are still on your probation then they can get you sacked with no reason at all. But anyway, he didn’t have the disciplinary with his first (and final) warning, they just got rid of him straight away and when I asked my manager if he could do that he said no, HR have to be present and have to have a warning first etc. definitely worth looking into the laws there	Southern_Passage3614	reply	na	na	na	0.9994902610778809	no	strong	no	na	offmychest	failed

"I turned 22 two weeks ago and ended up in sobbing tears because of how nothing went right either. I just think we’re at that stage in adulthood where the party’s over so to speak. We aren’t 18 or 21 which is the age when you still kind of get that celebration from other people. We’re trying to figure out our life and somewhere in there we realize our birthday doesn’t mean anything to most other people. It’s just a day and the world expects you to get on with it. 

For the record I’m not saying this is right, just what I noticed through my own failed birthday. It sucks and it’s shitty. But I think the best thing you can do is celebrate yourself.

If you’re in the states that also can effect things! Some states have a “right to work” law where jobs can fire employees with no notice and be fine but a large amount of states do not have that and you can fight it. If your HR is shitty and your dads friend wants to charge high prices you should still look into reporting them to your labour law office! It may not necessarily help you right away but it’s gov run lawyers and they’ll do the heavy lifting for you. So so sorry your birthday was shitty but from one internet stranger to another: Happy birthday! you deserve a great day, go get some cake, pick out a dope movie, cuddle up in bed and enjoy.

"For a start, I (F) am bisexual, but I prefer girls and I've always only matched with girls on Tinder and Bumble because I feel that guys on these apps are creeps. After one full month since I've downloaded (again) these apps with no results I decided to give the boys a try. On the first day I got a bunch of messages on Instagram from guys on Tinder, something that never happened with girls, and it just makes me feel weird, since there are so many that do this, I'm sure they do it with every single chick they see. It made me quite uncomfortable so I erased my Insta from Tinder. Anyway, I finally started talking with a guy and we were actually vibing, I enjoyed chatting and he seemed like a fun person, but I was the only one initiating conversations. In the end I sent him something motivational (he was feeling down) and he replied with 'I really appreciate it, sis'. I just got friendzoned by a guy. Friendzoned. By a guy. I stopped texting first and of course he never texted me again. 
I honestly don't know what I'm doing wrong. Maybe I'm asking for too much? The only time I actually got something from Tinder was my unhinged ex that tried to turn my friends against me after I broke up with her for being toxic. I'm so tired."

If it has been 5 years and you haven't made any progress moving on, it tells me that you keep up to date on her social media, or you look at old photos, texts, etc. If this sounds like you, you need to stop all of that if you want to move forward.

"I wasn’t in a relationship with him but he was my first love. It took me 3 1/2 years to get over him. You have to delete everything of her you have. Photos, videos, chats etc. block her on all social media, her number or whatever you have of her. You need a clean cut. If u did all of that already, that just means, that you are still in your healing phase. Looking at how she treated you and the nature of your relationship, it’s totally normal that you need more time to heal. Have you thought about therapy? It really helps! You just need the right therapist. 
If you are an extrovert, than try to socialise as much as you can, get to know ppl, have fun, look for a hobby, something,  that genuinely interests you. 
You will still think of her and it will still hurt but as time goes on, thinking of her won’t hurt as much and eventually, she will just cross you mind once in a while and it won’t affect you anymore. 
The one think you have to do so all of that actually works is, ACTUALLY wanting it. You need to actively commit to getting over her. Maybe, deep down, you are still holding on to her and the few good moments you had. You need to fully let go. I can only imagine how hard that must be.

Oh Jesus man... I feel so sorry for you. And I'm afraid I'm going through the same path. My girlfriend of a 7 year relationship broke up with me and is now dating another girl (I'm a guy). She told me she doesn't feel comfortable with the male body anymore one week after we had the most amazing sex, as if it never happened. She is and I feel like she'll always be the one true love of my life, I never had such a strong bond and connection to anyone, it's crazy. Every. Single. Thing. Reminds me of her. She doesn't deserve my romantic love anymore, but I'm hopeless. She seems to have already moved on, REALLY fast, but I'm absolutely miserable, on shit.

I already hurt my left knee squatting heavy like a maniac. I admit I am over empathetic as a person & I’m often taken advantage over. She was unfaithful for years, I’ve never been deceived that way. From what I’ve observed from many sources she is pregnant again. The women you miss, just let it go. Obviously easier said than done, but keep an open heart because I’m sure somewhere out there is a women who love & cherish you. I’ve slept with 3 women since my break up & it kind of made me feel more lonely. You need to focus on yourself & everyday tasks. Do not use dating sites, find a women out in the open , go to events, go to the beach , do real things. Nobody should live in your mind rent free. If you feel you need help seek counseling.

I was in your position once, and it SUCKS. I was with my ex for 3 years (15-18) and he lived in my head rent free for so long. And it made it hard to be with anyone else. I tried to get over him and had a bunch of short term relationships (2/3 months) but I was still in love with him. And these other guys knew it. I self sabotaged everything good in my life because I was secretly holding out hope that he’d unblock me and admit that he made a mistake. And we’d live happily ever after. But that day never came. Eventually I moved on and found myself missing him less and less until I almost forgot about him. I moved to another city for college and started to enjoy life. I went out and made new friends. I came home once I finished. I had truly healed and loved myself for who I am. I then found the love of my life (I wasn’t even looking for a relationship). We have been together 8 years and have been married for 3 years. Please, PLEASE don’t give up hope. You WILL love again and it will be amazing. But please take all the time you need to heal and get therapy if you need it (I went to therapy for 2 years in college and it helped with my self esteem issues).

This is what most would call obsession. You must have created this perfect image in your head and fantasized about her so much, when in reality she's not all that great. You fell in love with that image you had of her in your head, and you want that back. I don't believe people truly get over somebody in a short span of time, and when I say short span I'm talking 1-2 years because if you were in a relationship where you were crazy about them then yeah it's going to take a long time to get over them, but I think it would take 3 years or longer to actually move on. Hard pill we have to swallow, but it simply can't be. This is my philosophy in life: Don't stress over things you can't control. You really don't have a choice but to move on. It's just going to hurt and hurt and hurt all the time and there's nothing you can do to change the reality of it, so you have to accept that and move on. You HAVE to. That's not being cheesy or corny, it's the truth. You really don't have a choice anymore. I'm sorry.

"We met five years ago in our college freshman dorms. We had a hall meeting and I noticed him immediately. He lit up the room. He has such a radiant smile. He is so funny. He was handsome, but not in a way that intimidated me. He asked me my favorite movie and I couldn't find a good answer. We ended up talking all night. The chemistry was immediate. I used to think how silly ""love at first sight"" sounded, but... I get it. I spent that night thinking we were made for each other. Two weeks later he told me he loved me and it rocked my world. Five years later, he is still the light of my life. He's encouraged me in every way. I've grown as a woman, an artist, and I'm just... so happy. Every day now I wake up next to him, so thankful. I found my perfect person. Theres not a day I'm not madly in love. We are alike in all of the important ways, and different in all of the best ways. He challenges my mind and supports my passions. I smile so much. 

Life feels so fast now, but I'm not afraid when he's along for the ride. We've been doing this thing together. I feel safer each day that passes. I tell him every day how grateful I am. How wonderful he is. But words aren't enough.

This is so nice and refreshing to  read I had the same exact thing but sadly, it is what it feels like forever gone don’t know what to do anymore. Built amazing empire together just to let it crumble and do nothing to  save it let alone rebuild it. I understand and took responsibility for my mistakes, not only that but tried a 100 ways to fix/make it better, but  maybe I should’ve tried 250, 500? This is very encouraging to read though. For once I can see I’m a little envious of course the envious feeling isn’t stronger than the happiness I feel for you and I’m glad that you got that!

"I feel so weird sometimes being surrounded by my friends that say they want to eat the rich, because well for starters am I included in that?

My family came as immigrants and started a manufacturing company, fast forward about 25 years and it is now worth about 25 million dollars. 

Are we rude about our money? Ofc not, it has never defined who we are as people. I’ve always viewed it as a safety net helping to pay through college for example and avoiding crippling debt for life.

I guess my question is where do we draw the line at who “deserves” their wealth and who “deserves” to be eaten.

Ofc some can agree on Musk, Bezos, Zuckerburg etc. but what about wealthy people you “like”? 
Whether it be a favorite actor, musician, YouTuber, etc. At what point do they cross the threshold of they should be “eaten.” 

I believe it was Penelope Scott who said “Well I don’t want to eat the rich, because I’d have to eat my heroes first.”

In no way am I trying to suggest that i suffer from some form of “rich people problems” but rather questions of disillusionment with those who would prefer I don’t have the resources I do.

It’s easy to point at the guy bigger than you and say “that’s who we should take down a peg.” Until you are the one being taken down.

Maybe I’m a hypocrite. Maybe I don’t have enough life experience. It could be all be a factor but overall I’m glad I am who i am and am grateful for what i have."	throwaway145363	post	26.693120212657384	male	White	0.0030706513207405806	na	na	na	1	offmychest	no prediction.
"I'm related to people who are rich from inheriting their wealth. Not as rich as you but they inherited the company my great grandfather and grandfather started and are multi-millionaires.

They think they're poor. They complain about things being too expensive. They think they're just regular people but they have no idea what it's actually like. And they're snobs, but they obviously don't think they are. Rich people are out of touch.

Because the family was sexist, my mother and aunt weren't allowed in the family business. My aunt became successful on her own, although is likely much less wealthy, whereas my mom married my dad who was at one point quite successful but was bad with money. So my family is the poor family who has nothing. Do you think her siblings ever cared to help out? Do you think my mom was given any share in the family business or anything to make up for being excluded? Were my mother's brothers somehow more deserving? Only the males have been able to work in the business. Are my cousins, especially the men, deserving of their wealth? I can tell you they're not. Some of them are quite stupid. My one cousin is so stupid that if his dad hadn't given him a job I don't think he'd be able to keep a normal job. Yet he's rich.

You probably also think you're just a regular person, but where would you be if your ancestors hadn't started that company? Did you do something to deserve what you have?

the dream starts off in my old house, one that I keep dreaming of for some reason, and my mom is sitting on my couch to the left me and my two siblings are sitting next to me on the right. 

the tv is on in front of us and my mom has an airpod in her ear that I didn’t notice until she says something. 


anyway, my dad walks in and he has a pillow and he puts it on the floor so he can lay on it. he also has his phone and his AirPods. 

so like as soon as he sits down my mom says, “is someone connected to my AirPods?”, and she turns right to my dad who looks up at her from the floor, and the last thing I hear before waking up is, “i know that that’s r*pe.”

It's difficult to say from your post as you aren't sharing what those true emotions are. Are those true emotions that you're sad Henry Cavill isn't playing Geralt anymore, or are they that you're not attracted to him physically anymore because he's gained some weight?

"The title basically says it all but there is a bit of context.

My boyfriend (18M) and I (18F) started dating about 2 1/2 months ago. I didn't expect it but I was very happy with him. Unfortunately we only had about 2 weeks because 2 weeks after we started dating I left to go to Canada for 7 weeks. This trip was planned long before and I was going with 2 friends to travel.

I had no doubt we would stay together during that and we did, we texted everyday even if there was a 9 hour time difference and everything was okay. As we got to the end of the trip I got more and more excited to seee him again and so did he.

I got back this monday, up until this day everything was okay. We obviously wanted to meet that day and always talked about that prior. Suddenly he tells me he has no time. It made me sad oviously, but I didn't think too much of it because I knew he had a lot going on. But when he acted really distant the following day I confronted him about it.

All he said is that he doesn't know what's wrong. I asked him a lot of questions and barely got any information out of him. All I know is that for some reason he doesn't really want to see me. He confirmed that it's nothing I've done wrong and he doesn't know why either. To my question if everything will go back to normal he just said maybe.

I'm devastated. I don't know what to do, I haven't seen him for almost 2 months and I miss him so much. It just sounds like he lost feelings for me. Over one day. It doesn't make any sense to me at all and I just want to be with him again :("	ChatCaat	post	14.087318492108842	female	White	0.9993045330047607	na	na	na	4	offmychest	age: 18, gender: female, explanation: the author mentions her age and gender (18f) in the text. as for ethnicity, the text doesn't provide any specific cultural contexts or details that could help in predicting it.
As a man, if I were in his shoes - there would be a high possibility of checking out of the relationship during your trip. You're talking about 2 weeks vs 7 weeks. Over 75% of your relationship was spent apart. At that point, you're glorified pen pals. Even though you would be coming back at the end of it, the foundation of which the relationship started was rocky at best, all because of that trip.

My recommendation, if you truly love him, is to be consistent in his life. Give him space, but let him know that you're there for him. Men like to know that they're cared for. If he truly feels the same as you, he will eventually come back. And when he does, show him how deeply you care for him. I wish you two the best!

I want to gain enough money so that my mom, who always struggle with money, dont have to worry about it anymore, and maybe help my brother pay a little portion of his studies. I want to do good work. Im clumsy and struggle with organization but i want to overcome this and provide good work.

Physically, i dont really know... the things that i want to change cant be changed so..  i want to take care of myself first. I want to be fit without being overly muscular. I plan to do gym 1-2 times a week and swimming 2-3 times a month when september comes. Hope it will help me keep me fit (i already am fit enough), and develop strength.

I have my cleaning schedule and i try to cook more difficult plates. I want to be the man that keep the house perfectly clean and that cook the plates that makes my friends want to come everyday.

I want to be a good person. I think that deep down i already am. I am very sensitive for a man and, even if its making things difficult sometimes,  i have the ability to really understand people's struggles. I am kind to children and animals, and i want to be kind to adults. I want to make people smile. I dont know how i could do it, maybe by joining an association or something, but i will try. I want to make my friends feel confident and loved. If i got a girlfriend, i want to make her feel like she is the most precious thing on earth, i want to make her feel loved just by the feeling of my kisses and that she go to sleep without being worried by anithing because im here. I want to fight against all discriminations. Im a white male that never been discriminate because of who i am. Im joining the pride on september because i want to know the struggles of my friends from the lgbtq community. I want to fight so that the world is a better and nicer place.

"TW: SA, child.

Does anyone ever feel like therapy is a double edged sword, in that it is incredibly healing but also serves as a regular reminder to the past and all the negative feelings associated? 

I (30F) have been working through childhood trauma and ptsd for 2 years in therapy and my relationship with my dad and stepmom have suffered greatly.  

A bit of backstory while also attempting to keep things vague, I was SA'd by someone who my step parent was not supposed to leave me alone with when I maybe 8 years old.  This happened at her place of work where I was spending the day during summer break.  I did not tell my parents what happened as I was so young and didn't fully understand until I was older.  My step parent only found out about this event by reading my diary and came to me questioning me about it as if I were to blame.  After I stormed from the room crying, they didn't follow and didn't ask any more questions.  The kicker of all of this was my step parent was a mandated reporter due to their career field and still did nothing to report this crime or seek help for me.  

The second time I brought up my assault was 10 years later, I was starting college and therapy, when my young and inexperienced therapist stupidly suggested I just confront them about everything.  To which both parents replied, ""Oh, we thought you were kidding about that."" and never mentioned it again.  This also resorted in me running away and crying.  

I have spent many holidays and vacations visiting my family from the time of my assault to when I started therapy, and even lived with these parents for a while in college, but only now am I feeling too rage filled to even consider going out of my way to see them in their new city 16 hours from mine.  But I still receive frequent guilt trips to make the trip.   

The way my brain sees it is it does not matter how much good they have done for me or love they have shown, I am suddenly feeling incapable of moving passed this.  I was a child and I needed their help and they didn't even care. 

I appreciate any kind words or shared therapy experiences... due to the nature of this and my friends having their own SA stories to recover from, it has been very hard to find someone to talk about this with other than my therapist.  I'm not sure what the solution is here, I don't want to bring it up a third time just to suffer another let down.

After everyones advice to look for hidden cameras in my room I tried everything recommended but didn't find anything. I couldn't get the thought out of my head though so I decided to go look through my brothers laptop when he wasn't home the next day. Honestly it broke me. He had dozens of pictures he had taken of me without me knowing, pictures of my underwear with cum in them, and a lot of other fucked up shit off the internet.

I immediately sent pictures of everything to my parents, packed up a bag told a friend I needed a place to stay for a few days and left. My parents have been trying to call me non-stop and have texted me to come home and talk about it, but I've made it clear I don't plan on coming home unless he is out of the house for good.

Don't know what I'm going to do if they don't kick him out, but for now just trying to get the thoughts of everything I saw out of my head and take care of my own mental health.

"Congrats for your initiative and courage!

Luckily, you're over 18, so already an adult now, and you have the right to live however you want.

My advice, try renting your own place, like many people your age already do, while in college. Who knows, maybe your parents, knowing now the situation, will help you with money.

If that's not possible, then continue being helped by your friend, until you'll be able to rent your own place.
Also UNI dorms could be a good idea too.

Lots of people may recommend to take it further, honestly as long as you are away it may just be an extra burden.


As for your parents, while you have every right to feel anger, maybe don't cut them from the chance to do the right thing. When the moment is right, it might help to talk and express what you expect from them.

Parenting is hard, it's their job but don't underestimate how lost they are and if you know what you need from them, don't hesitate to voice it over. Stand for yourself definitely and don't accept any sort of compromise though.

"I posted the other day about them saying we're not friends, after that I had a talk with them saying it's fine, that my feelings were hurt but I understood.

Then it hit the fan. I offered to help decorate and make cupcakes for one of their birthdays for the office, and that caused the person planning it to throw a fit and say ""you just do it."" And later after not knowing what to do I just apologized if it seemed I was overstepping and that wasn't my intention, I was just offering my help. She said cool, let's decorate togethee on Monday. 

Monday comes, no one says anything to me about decorating. I'm waiting, I move to a new desk to remove myself from that area because I just wanted some distance from everything, nothing. They start decorating and I hear one of them go ""SHE was SUPPOSED to decorate but DIDNT"" that's when I got out the decorations from my purse and was going to hand them over and they declined and told me they got their own go put them innthe drawer and walked away. I cried, not because my feelings were hurt but because even though I had moved away I was still on the receiving end of pettiness. I did call the crisis hotline because I couldn't get my emotions under control. 

Today comes. I contemplated asking my husband to take me to the ER for mental health inpatient but i decided i just want to keep pushing. First half of the day is fine, I hear laughter and some jokes at my expense, but whatever. I'm away from it. Then I hear some laughter about something, the biggest perpetrator telling others to look and laughing, swapping numbers to text instead of message on teams. I get up to go get a snack and I hear ""she got up"". I'm like.. okay this is about me, there's something, let me go get my snack and grab the rest of my stuff. They had put a figure urn shaped like a gravestone that said ""ashes of problem employees"" there. No one said a word or looked at me. I had an anxiety attack, went outside, texted our supervisor (they're in another state) and said we need to have a meeting because there's bullying happening and it's damaging my work performance. 

Our supervisor agreed this shouldn't be happening and ""no one should have to work in a hostile environment"" were his words.

This is my first time actually writing on Reddit so bear with me. So I (19F) been with my Bf(19M) for 3 years. I had caught him cheating and confronted him when we were parked in front of my house. I had grabbed his phone to see the messages and he was trying to get it back so I got out of the car to look at the messages more(which I'm aware now was a pretty bad idea, I just wanted to see how far back all this went). He got out of the car too and started walking towards me, threatening to hit me, and knock me out on the street then and there. I immediately gave him back his phone, not wanting to poke the bear, and he immediately started apologizing.Saying he would never actually hurt me, how I know he would never lay a finger on me. Everything just seems so incomprehensible to me right now, I mean I always believed he would never lay his hands on me but in that moment he just flipped on me in an instant.

I was in a very similar scenario and situation. He threatened to leave me stranded after I had seen the cheating instances on his phone and he threw his phone at me.

"As the others said, just break up. He did cheat once, he can cheat again. I will continue about the anger thing because I know more about that.

I can add up that I had anger issues as well. I was able to react in that way too (23m now). Luckily for me I managed to control myself enough to not threaten any of my past gfs. But I was not far and I did very similar stuff to family members.

Anyway, saying this because I can just feel that he is very insecure, has unresolved issues with himself and really is just a bad person at the moment. He did threaten you because his mind still wanted to hide the cheating, even if he was too late. He wanted to control you and not accept/admit on his cheating. Even if you exclude the cheating, you cannot just forgive him. He needs to really work on himself, really take action. He can open up to someone, start to work on himself and have a healthier life. Ultimately he needs to know he has a problem and go to therapy.

"I would end the relationship. While he may be horrofied at his actions and may never behave like that again, this can often be the start of DV. 


 A little story (not mine)on how bad it can get and how quickly. 
                         ⚠️ Trigger warning DV⚠️ 
I am not trying to bring any bad memories for anyone it's meant to show how bad it can get.

1st time. 
He threatened you. He was angry at something you did and allowed his emotions to get the better of him. Only after he gets his way (phone back) does the instant regret hit he feels guilty and would never actually hit you, you know him. You accept his apology and believe him. This set a president because he sees how his reaction corrected your behaviour to his liking.

Next time
You push his buttons, and once again, he lets his emotions get the better of him, but the verbal assault doesn't work quickly enough, so he pushes you. It's not hard enough to hurt you, but it scares you. You do what he was hoping. Again, he apologised and said he never meant to touch, but he didn't actually hurt you he didn't actually hit you he just needed you to listen. You forgive him because it's true he didn't actually hit you, and he did ask you to do what he wanted multiple times and he really is sorry he cried that he let it go that far. You are now consoling him. This again lets him see he can get away with it.

Time after that.
You are having a disagreement, and he loses it and slaps you. This time, he isn't as sorry, Why did you have to push him so far? If you had just seen his side of things, it wouldn't have happened. He just loves you so much. You are now terrified, and maybe it was your fault.

Since then, he has been more snappy. He is aggressive and angry, but only when you rub him up the wrong way. When things go his way, it is so nice he is happy. So you are walking on eggshells, trying not to disagree with him or upset the balance. This may mean you don't see your friends and family as much, and you aren't sure why, but you don't tell them what happening just say you are so busy with work and doing things together you don't have spare time right now but will make some soon. 

Next time
You aren't sure what really kicked it off, but you took the verbal and physical assault and he tells you it is your fault, you couldn't help yourself but had to push him to do it. You started it. You brought it on yourself.

The cycle continues.This can happen to both men and women, and those who escape and survive it some will say they wish they had left after that first time. Many people, by the time they leave, have lost so much of not only themselves but sometime family and friends. Some people don't escape at all.

Take time to think about everything, don't hide it from family and friends, talk to them about what happened if you feel they can be a support for you. be kind to yourself and put you first."	El_compa__jose	reply	na	na	na	0.9946200847625732	no	strong	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.

Oh my god… Run far, run fast NOWWW! HE WILL HIT YOU EVENTUALLY! And once he hits you the first time he will continue to hit you. And he’s already cheated on you, that will continue as well.

And as young as we were he never & has still never even so much as called me a single bad name, let alone threaten me or cheat on me. Once an abuser & cheater they always will be like that. Even immature at 19 years old a good man would never act like that. Please, please, pleaseeee leave his ass asap, this relationship will always be toxic & he will always be abusive. I’m seriously worried for you sweetie, please please leave him & go stay with your family for support & protection. He’s not a good guy, you deserve someone who will treat you right.

It'll just be a tactic for him to get things to go his way... until it doesn't work anymore, and then it could escalate to physical violence.

Life is too short to spend it with an abuser, and can be made even shorter by them, if you do. Don't ever be alone with him again.

When I was 19, I was dating a 31 year old man; don’t get me started on grooming and age gap relationships. Anyway, first time he threatened to hit me we were into year one, and I also thought it was a scare tactic. Turns out, it wasn’t. The physical abuse, came with emotional, psychological, and sexual abuse. He gaslit me constantly, especially about his cheating. Is it worth even trying to figure out if he WILL follow through on those threats? You’re 19, you’re young and have your whole life ahead of you. When people show you who they are, believe them. Don’t make my mistake. It has impacted all of relationships after that, and my marriage. I have attended countless hours of therapy, and spent thousands.

SMH, stealing a phone to go into his personal life. He obviously doesn't want you there if he didn't already share the info. 

If him cheating on you wasn't a good reason to dump him, you could have asked to see his phone one condition of staying together, but seriously..

"We don't go into relationships thinking that our chosen partner is a violent person who, if angry enough, would be violent towards us. Unfortunately, despite the state of shock we find ourselves in when they first show us that side of themselves, we must practice self preservation. In relationships of all kinds there are lines that should never be crossed. Once that line has been crossed (or in your case two separate lines... cheating and the show of violence) you can't go back to the way things were. I am not going to sit here and advise you to leave him, nor am I advising you to stay. Only you can make that decision because you are the one who has to live with it on a daily basis. I am instead going to suggest you ask yourself some tough and serious questions. Knowing what you know now can you ever trust him not to cheat on you again?

"I call my bio-dad that because he contributed nothing more to my existence than DNA and a lot of heartache.

We were able to pinpoint 2 weeks of a ""marriage"" that lasted around 30 years in which he *might* have been faithful. Trapped, we survived because of my grandparents and the hand of God.

He always threatened to hit Mom. He would constantly abuse us in every way but that, and he hit me once. Just once. Mom threatened him after that, and he left me alone physically afterward.

His abuse covered anything that wouldn't show: neglect of pets, resulting in death; constant undermining of our confidence (to this day Mom doesn't weigh in public, and she has a long list of triggers), and I won't even begin to talk about the long list of my difficulties, which I am working to overcome. He spread lies about us that we contend with today (and he died of COVID).

He criticized our weight. Yes, we agreed we were a little overweight, so we each went on a diet. What do you think he did? He began trying to take us to the steak house, and while we were a captive audience, he would criticize what we got to eat (which was well within the diet's guidelines. It was all about wanting us to do without.)

And the day came when he actually did hit Mom, after asking her all these years, ""Do you want me to blouse your lip?"" and saying, ""Egg her on ol' Devil! Get her hurt!"" We'd gone somewhere, I had a camera, and I got their last blow out in stills because he'd threatened to take out a billboard advertising what a bad housekeeper she was (and she was not. What do you expect from someone living in that situation? Not to mention nothing was ever good enough.)

This has been a glimpse into the future of life with him. Poking the bear? Don't live with one. Then you won't have to worry about poking it. Every time you don't poke it, you sacrifice a little of yourself to it. Before long, you have nothing left.

RUN!!! Don't look back! Real men don't do that! Real men treat their girlfriends/wives like they're a queen!

"Run. When I was 18, my ex-husband came in at 2:00am, from hanging with his friends. He woke me up, to make him a hamburger. When I refused, he punched me, then went running to his mother's apartment. I packed our infant daughter & some clothes, and walked to my mother's home about 8 blocks away. My mother's friend, who had known me since I was 12, went to my apartment, proceeded to give my ex 2 black eyes, then came back to my mother's place.
My daughter and I stayed for 3 days at my mother's (I had the days off from work). I went back, never mentioned the punch, but started saving even more of my pay, working as much o.t. as I could, and before another 3 months had passed, I packed our things and left him, the furniture, the apartment. When his mother asked me why, I gave her the picture of me with the black eye. He had never told his mother he punched me. Just that I wouldn't fix him something to eat (this was after me working 10hrs that evening & only asleep for an hour, when he came from having fun, with his friends).
If you had asked me before we were married, he would have been the last person to hit me. Our marriage wasn't going good & that's why I was saving to leave. His hitting me, was the final straw!
Don't wait until he actually follows through and hits you. END the relationship right now. You already know he's being unfaithful! He's already threatened you!

You need to break it off immediately. 1.) he has severed that trust between you and him by cheating and 2.) has now harmed you after confrontation and said he’d never actually hurt you -he’s trying to gain your trust again and manipulate you to think he won’t do it again, however who knows when he will.

"Hi. As the title suggests, I was raped once a couple of years ago. It was how I lost my virginity, despite having previous relationships where I abstained from sex deliberately. 

The rape wasn't particularly violent, but I've never, ever experienced something so painful and humiliating before or since.


It's not the kind of thing I can talk to friends or family about, but I feel so much guilt about the stupid way I reacted, and the repugnant way I just froze and let it happen. It was in a public place at night, and I could've called for help, punched him, or done ANYTHING. Instead I just pathetically let him grope me, bite me and tear off some of my clothes, for nearly an hour. He then very briefly raped me, and I was so repulsed at how i felt the pre-cum from his dick just trickle down my thighs. As soon as I got back into my hotel room, I broke down and just sobbed for hours. 

But what's worse is how my body reacted. I've read a lot about it, I've heard survivors share similar experiences and I would never blame them, but I will never forgive myself for becoming turned on, both physically and psychologically. The mere memory of the event makes me wet and I need it to happen again. I don't want consensual sex, I don't deserve consensual sex, I need someone or multiple people to rape me harder and in a worse way than this person did. I need it to hurt, I need to be beaten and tied up and raped until I beg to be killed.

I know I wouldn't truly enjoy it, but some part of me clearly would as I can't become turned on without thinking about being choked, and forced to stare into his eyes as he groped me and bit my lips until they bled. I even become aroused at the memory of me fucking stumbling back to my hotel, bleeding, soaking and with my tights ripped. That's how sick I am. 

For other reasons, I am a disgusting ""person"" that has not and will not ever contribute to society in any meaningful way, so part of me feels like being raped Is all I'm good for. I KNOW this isn't how life works, but I feel like because I look younger and more innocent than I am, that if someone were to rape me, it would satisfy their urge and I'd prevent an innocent person from going through what I did for the first time. I know I'd regret it and be terrified if someone ever raped me again, but I've since antagonised strangers in similar situations, and it has gotten me mildly beaten up and groped on one occasion, but that was it. 

Despite me being far from blameless in this assault, I frequently feel bitter but also aroused whenever I remember times when I've been groped or catcalled (the catcalling started at age 11;  it was usually when I was in my school uniform,  and memories of that annoy me because I was a child and I hate pedophiles like any sane person).

I have had men (mainly online) degrade me and tell me in detail how they'd rape me if they could, and even that greatly turns me on. And I hate that I crave that.

Sorry for such a long post, I just needed to vent. But i just want to be verbally degraded or raped irl before I lose my damn mind."	ExtensionCapital539	post	16.56298730023926	female	White	0.9974339604377747	na	na	na	5	offmychest	no prediction.

"So I dated a girl a while ago,
A conversation popped up that included sex.

I asked her if I’m the best she’s had?
She said no.

And tbh I wished I didn’t or I wish she would’ve just lied at my expense,because man did that affect our sex life in the long run and affected our relationship,it made me feel she may go back to her ex or whoever was the best she ever had,considering her ex is taller than me he’s like 6ft3 and I’m like 5ft7.

At that time I responded well I believe,I asked her well what can I do then to be the best.

But it was too late ig,it just made me get turned off every time I think about it,it made me feel bad and inadequate.

So after some time,I decided to end it because I simply couldn’t look at her the same way anymore.

Maybe I’m just so egotistical or I’m so delusional or idk,I just think a person shouldn’t be in a relationship where he feels he’s not good enough.

"My (33M) wife (33F) has been sober for about 4 years now because she’s a recovering alcoholic. We were together when we were 18-23 but broke up because, long story short, she was an alcoholic (though I didn’t see it then) and we were long-distance at the time she didn’t have me around to keep her from going wild. 


Over the years we’d see each other briefly every couple years for a week or so until one of us had to go back home. Since we would only see each other for a few days, when she wanted to go out and then would get really drunk I just assumed she was just blowing off steam while I was visiting her.  I recognized that she would get excessively intoxicated but because I wouldn’t see her for very long I didn’t see the pattern.

I never really thought of her as an alcoholic because when we’re young I didn’t think about that and we were, you know, just kids having fun. Looking back she definitely always wanted to have more, but I was clueless so I never considered it. Now, it’s blindingly obvious and I’m disappointed in myself for not doing something about.

Almost 3 years ago I reached out to her on her birthday just saying “I hope you’re doing well”. Her response was a long message telling me that she was in AA now and she wanted to make amends to me for things she had done in the past and would like to talk. Talking with her, it was clear she had matured and had her life together.

Fast forward about 6 months and I had moved cities and was living with her. Basically, we were both the one that got away to each other and it was easy to slip back into relationship even though we had been apart for so long.

*side-note: I’m a little concerned that 1) she used me because she wanted stability and not because she really loved me at the time we got back together and/or that 2) I unintentionally exploited her emotional fragility due to her recent sobriety and the loneliness of Covid as a way to reignite the relationship. Either way, it’s worked out well, seeing as we’re married now, but still…

Now, before I moved to be with her and was living on my own I would have a beer or two with a coworker after work a couple days a week and smoke a joint right before I went to sleep and on weekends I indulged in those a little more. It was fine, helped my mental health and I enjoyed the social aspect of getting a drink with a friend, but if I ran out of weed or couldn’t get a drink I had absolutely no issue. No sort of withdrawal, no real cravings. I know I’m lucky in that way. 

So, when I first moved I was totally fine with being sober as a way to support her and I didn’t have any friends to have that beer with anyway. I wanted her to be comfortable in her sobriety. It’s now been more than 2 years and I’ve only had a drink of any kind a handful of times and those were times she had specifically asked me to (saying a toast at a wedding, etc.). 

Instead, she will talk relatively often about how much she wants to smoke weed or have a glass of wine and, without saying explicitly, she expects me to tell her no and that it’s a bad idea. She expects me to keep her sober even though I am not an alcoholic or sober by choice. Honestly, I feel like at this point she should be able to handle it herself and I shouldn’t have to be the one responsible for her.

She leans on me so much because of her sobriety that I’m starting to resent her a little bit. She had to cut out almost all of her friends because they’re heavy drinkers so she relies on me for her social interaction outside of work (and she isn’t close to any of her coworkers). She also doesn’t like going out as much anymore because she doesn’t want to have to deal with alcohol being around which stops me from doing things outside. 

Also, I’m naturally a pretty introspective guy so I’m not great at easy conversation and while I’m very comfortable just being with my wife, I’m not that witty or interesting (and, to be blunt, the sex isn’t as good now because we’re not as adventurous). I know alcohol shouldn’t be your personality, but having a glass of wine (literally one) makes me open up more in all the ways.

As for smoking weed, I would smoke right before I went to sleep to stop me thinking so much and it really helped my mental health. I never smoked and went out to do things. Unfortunately, my wife loved weed, so when I tried smoking weed after she went to sleep a handful of times (she knew, I wasn’t hiding it from her) she was passive-aggressive or just upset the next day. Even when I explained how it helped she would still be angry.

This is a selfish thing, because I want this for me, and there’s nothing that can be done but I reeeally wish she could control herself around substances. Being sober has helped her so much in a lot of ways, and I’m really proud of her. Obviously I know her sobriety is a net positive but fuck it’s aggravating sometimes."

"Your feelings are valid and completely normal. It is hard being with someone in recovery. Being married in general isn’t easy and requires sacrifices but this is one that can be especially challenging, alcohol is embedded in our culture. 

I would assume she has very good reason for getting sober. People don’t just join AA for no reason. Often people will quit all substances and if that’s what helps her stay sober then that is awesome. It’s not wrong to fantasize about a world where your partner can partake in something that you enjoy, but it’s important that you recognize how important it is for an alcoholic to stay sober. I ASSURE you that your wife will no longer be your “wife” if she returns to drinking. Alcoholism is completely life ruining and you’ll see her turn into an empty shell of a person, as dramatic as that sounds. You’d be living with someone you don’t even recognize in the worst possible way.  

No, it isn’t you who should be policing her to keep sober. That is NOT your responsibility. That is taxing for you and unfair. If she seems like she’s relying heavily on you for that kind of support then she needs to seek support from AA, or therapy because you don’t have the ability to be that person and that is a burden you simply can’t own. Only a professional can help with that sort of thing and of course, herself.  Even if you were on her all of the time you wouldn’t be able to keep her from relapse. You are her husband though and you should always have her best interest and health in mind so supporting her is important, but not policing or parenting her. Communication is super vital with this kind of thing, you should share your feelings with her because that’s the only way that this can get better, otherwise she’ll keep depending on you and that’s bound to end in a disaster. 

As far as your concerns with her “using you” or  you taking advantage of her in a countable state…Honestly people are messy, complicated creatures. Perhaps there’s a little bit of truth to both assertions but does that change anything? You married this woman and you love her, I’m sure she loves you. If she was attracted to your stability that doesn’t mean she doesn’t love you. If you took advantage of a situation with someone in a compromised state then it is great you have that insight now. Recognizing her as a human who was in a vulnerable position is important. You can’t change the past but learning to make healthy choices for yourself and for those in your life now is what’s important."

"Thank you. That was incredibly thoughtful and kind. I truly appreciate that.

She did have a good reason for getting sober, and AA is super important to her because of the community and support. I know that her sobriety is the most important thing to her because if she’s not sober then she can’t be a good partner (among many other things). I totally get that and want to support her in that. If I can’t do those things for her then I can accept that because at the end of the day making sacrifices for her is still worth it. It just doesn’t seem fair sometimes. She can be so focused on her sobriety that she doesn’t think about how I feel.

To be honest, I’m not very good at communicating these things and don’t feel confident enough to address them in a healthy way so I just generally just push them aside.

I will add: as a former party girl who isn’t sober (but who just gave up on partying/binge drinking) I can tell you that the grass will ALWAYS be greener on the other side. Like yeah, I know that things in the past with her may have seemed more exciting but that is part of growing up. Everyone has nostalgia from the past. You may be looking for fun and novelty, maybe to you it feels like a glass of wine could ignite that spark. However, drinking only does so much and really becomes lame the older you get. Maybe you’re really just missing those deep conversations and spontaneous moments. You can literally can do all those things sober but it just takes vulnerability. Maybe try checking out new scenery, travel, roleplay, hike together, or do something stupid and goofy. These things will increase dopamine between you both but won’t require her to get high/drink.

"I'm sitting on the porch, waiting for the rain. It's blowing wind and keeps thundering and lightning, but there's no rain. It's just my dog and me, he's laying in the dirt. Not scared of the thunder, he just lays his head down and occasionally looks up at me or looks at a car that's zooming by. We live right off a highway with a small mountain in front of our barn. 

The cool air feels nice, running through my hair. The sun is starting to set and the clouds are a beautiful yellow and pink color on one side of the sky then a dark indigo and purple on the other side. The thunder is soft but heavy sounding but the closer it gets the more it sounds like a firework popping off. 

After about half an hour my grandpa comes walking up from the garden asking what I'm waiting for. I tell him about the rain. He sits down and waits with me. We talk about work and thunder. He tells me “The stronger the lightning the louder the thunder” We wait until we witness a strong lightning strike and then a roar of thunder. Soon it starts sprinkling and I smell the beautiful rain then it starts down pouring. My dog comes and sits next to me and we sit and watch the rain."

"On Sunday night my boyfriend got arrested. I have no idea why. 

Some background on my boyfriend, he’s the sweetest most genuine guy. Not violent nor an angry person hence why I am so shocked.

In the days following up to this he took 8 tabs total of lsd within a four day period. I know that the reason he has been arrested is not because of drugs as his sister has confirmed this however she will not tell me the actual reason. I suspect whatever he has done is either because of the acid or the after effects. 

They held him for 24 hours but then didn’t release him as they now class him as a suicide risk. It’s now been over 48 hours and I’m completely clueless and in pieces.

I don’t know how to feel. I’m sad but I’m angry and I’m sorry for him. I just want to know what he’s done and know that he’s okay and just hold him. 

When I get to speak to him what should my first reaction be? Comforting? Anger?

I know you’re sad and alone, hun, and it’s okay to be feeling whatever it is you’re feeling.

Even though I'm surrounded by my family members I feel alone at home, as soon as I finish up with my work I come outside I try to talk with my mom she gets hostile and everytime I become the bad guy & argument ensues.

"What did covid impact on your life? 
In my case I've seen hundreds of people dying in front of me still convinced myself it'll be alright but in mean time I lost a part of me.. 
She was like a film, I don't know where to begin with.. 

I was having a bad day, it was lockdown.. when we still believed I'll just last for 3 months. 
I called her, cried over the problem I was going crazy that time.. It was some family problems but hectic ones, she told me it'll be okay.. I wasn't convinced still nodded. Then i dont know why i just dumped all of my problems to her and hoping for maybe I'll feel better. 
Days were passing i was so down that it was easier to just kill myself. I was being possessive lately then, maybe it was a trauma effect of the problems I was facing that even bothered her for just being there with me. I didn't liked her in pain i told her to just go away and get a better life, she convinced me that she'll be there for me.. After that I took her for granted,I was being possessive and controlling that made her go out of my life. After that I had every other evening without her.. 
I tried to fix this up through call or meeting 

But it didn't happened, we haven't met still after these years... 

Fast forward to this date, I still sometimes check her profile, sometimes it's privet sometimes it's open.. Kinda not in touch anymore 
We don't talk... 

I've been trying to get in the point.. I don't think she'll trust me again but I hope

Last night my mother went to a barbeque at her bfs and got really drunk. I called her at around 11pm to check on her and to see how much longer she was going to be out and she sounded like she had been crying which in her case usually means she's also been drinking so I asked her about it and she told me she just had a stuffy nose and that she was fine/hadn't been drinking. I chose to believe her after asking multiple times and ended the call. Around 40 minutes later I tried calling her since she told me she'd be on her way home in 30 minutes but I couldn't reach her, her phone wasn't even ringing. After trying multiple times I texted and called her boyfriend and he said she was on her way home. I kept calling her for another 10 minutes or longer and then she finally got home and guess what? She was fucking drunk. I couldn't believe it. Her phone was dead and she was driving drunk. She couldn't stand upright and was stumbeling so much I thought I'd have to carry her to bed. Her eyes were bloodshot so she'd clearly been crying. I went to bring her water a couple minutes later and she was just sitting on her bed with her head hanging down like she was an animatronic that was turned off or something and she wasn't moving. It took a couple minutes to get her to move let alone stand up. She's done this stuff before and almost every time she said that that was the last time. That she'll never do it again. Of course I didn't believe her because I know better but I'm still so mad and confused I guess. I'm 15 I still need her. I can't go into the system, we've fought so hard to prevent that from happening. If someone had caught her, it could've all been over. All these years of fighting those idiots from social services would have been for nothing. Ruined because she wouldn't refuse a couple drinks for the sake of her fucking daughter. I'm so fucking done. I'm glad I'm moving next year because I don't know how much longer I can deal with this shit.

That’s it. I don’t have any friends, I do school online, I only have two years left and I have no idea what I want to do with my life. Meanwhile my cousin is 17 and traveling before she goes off to college to pursue the career she’s talked about since elementary school. I slept on the couch up until February of this year when we moved. I don’t have any friends now but I did have friends back when I lived in a house that I was embarrassed of. I always avoided FaceTime calls and never invited anyone over. I never participated. I’m not smart. I’m not pretty. I don’t have anything going for me. Recently I’ve just accepted that I won’t make it far in life. I’ve been rotting since 2020. I was starting to become very depressed that year. In 2021 I told myself that things would get better and that I just have to think positive. In 2022 I realized that things could only get better if I moved and started over but that only ever happens in movies. This year I realized that things are never going to get better for me and that I was born to live in the shadows while my cousins live in the spotlight. I’m an only child. All of my cousins have siblings. They would come over and play but eventually they went back home with each other and I only had myself. I didn’t think it would end up like this. My aunt is talking about moving to the place where I’ve wanted to live for ages. She’s a nurse, I know she can afford it. They’ll most likely move and my nine year old cousin will continue to grow up nice. I cry about it most of the time but there are some times when I can only look at her and be happy that she didn’t grow up the way I did.	seokjinsleftnipple	post	15.401355818300388	female	White	0.9985193610191345	na	na	na	4	offmychest	no prediction.
You're not a loser and all life is only a head of you. You have maybe the same as i have, i have problem socializing with people and at that age i was truly at the same point as you but it changed once i become older, found interests for me like combat sports, formula found hobbies that were taking my mind away from this dark mindset and made a friend at a time. You dont need a lot of friends. You just need couple real friends. They are hard to find espeically if you move somewhere away. But people are nice, this is what i understood. Just found something you can do locally like boxing, maybe some rc car racing, whatever is in your interests  sign up a club and just dont be afraid of that first contact.

"Sorry if you bother to take the time to read any of this, haha. It's really not a spectacular story or anything.
  

  

  
A week ago, after about a month of working up the courage and at the encouragement of my friends, I decided to take the plunge and ask out the guy I liked. We worked together over the summer pretty closely, one on one in an out of state field position where we stayed with a few other coworkers in shared housing. The job was ending in a few days (last week), and it was the last day we were going to be stuck one on one together, so I figured it was the best time to do it at the end of that day.
  

  
So! I asked him to go to this place with me, because we were both supposed to be going back to the same state for a little bit, and he'd said previously he liked those kind of places and it was one he'd never been to himself before. I had originally meant to ask him and explicitly say the word date, but I kind of panicked at the time, fumbled my words very badly (I'm pretty shy, with bad anxiety, and I was Nervous as hell, haha) and did not actually manage to say the word. He said yes, but I was worried he didn't get I'd meant it as a date (as such is a thing that tends to happen, lol).
  

  
I should have just let things go from there and saw how everything progressed ugh. I'm literally so stupid haha. I really thought this boy liked me back! I guess I must have read the situation and how we were getting on really poorly, lol.
  

  
On Wednesday when it was time to leave and start the drive home to my original state, I figured I'd just tell him that I'd meant the invitation to be me asking him out. I'd fretted over this for a few days already, and I'd asked a few people for advice and they all seemed to think it was a good idea to just be clear. So, we said our goodbyes, which was kind of an anxious blur to me now, lol, and then I just. told him. lol.
  

  
Of course, it didn't go well. He looked really kind of distressed and upset, and all he said was just 'oh.'
  

  
Ahhh. I had been afraid of something like that happening, but the look on his face still really hurt lol. It still is kind of just. Haunting me, haha. I rushed out a quick 'it's okay/don't worry about it/it's no big deal,' turned around, said bye really fast and basically rushed out of the house and left.
  

  
Obviously, it's been almost a full week now (tomorrow morning) and I haven't actually heard anything from him at all. (I mean, aside from this phone app game we've been playing against each other in. He's still playing his turns back against me, but I kind of feel like that's more, like. Trying not to be mean, or pity, i guess?) I know what happened is rejection enough, but deep down I know I've still been clinging to this tiny hope he might still try to talk to me about it, or at least say something, Even if it's just like, sorry, no. Haha. I know it's stupid. I wish I could stop, but, well. He leaves the state to go back home next Monday, though, so I know I can drop any stupid fantasies once that day hits. I hate this.
  

  

  
I just feel so incredibly stupid. No one's ever liked me before, and I never would have actually asked him out if I hadn't been like. Really convinced he actually did like me too. But clearly I can't read people at all, it turns out! And I feel SO dumb for thinking it was even remotely possible.
  

  
And especially him!!! He's literally such an amazing person. And I thought we were getting along so well, and we had a lot of similar interests and takes on life and goals/ideals for the future. Lol. The thing that sucks the most is knowing I basically fucking ruined any chance at getting to just be friends with him now. If I had just been smart and realistic, I should have just been happy to leave it at getting to hang out with him for a little bit and getting to stay friends with him. We'd talked about playing a couple video games together, and there was a chance we'd get to work together in the future, too. And I also just really feel bad for making *him* feel bad and uncomfortable, lol. God.
  

  
Also it's not the last time I'll see him, we're going to be going to be going to this work-related event thing in a couple months with a couple of our other coworkers/friends from the summer, too. I'm just afraid it's going to be awkward and idk how I'm going to look him in the face lol. I don't know.
  

  

  
Idk! I feel like I made the a wrong decision (the worst decision, ugh) and got spat into the bad timeline again. Honestly feels like the story of my life so far! Things start going well or nice and I get happy and a little hopeful and excited about the future, and then the universe turns around and spits everything back in my face lmao.
  

  
I should have known better than to ever think asking him was a good idea. I know I'm just. Not the kind of person people ever like? I don't really know why, but it's definitely a thing at this point. Sorry. Ugh. I kind of wish I could say sorry to him. But also, I'm pretty sure the last thing he probably wants is to ever hear from me again, lol.

"I (28F) under a crushing amount of stress between an intense job, a move, kids, a rocky marriage, mentally ill parents, etc. I've been putting a lot of work into talking myself down from the ledge and not spiraling into self-hatred or self-harm. It's hard, but as a parent and the breadwinner I can't afford a breakdown and I want to take care of myself and lead by example. My mother screamed about how nobody loved her and how she hated us and broke plates, my dad was an alcoholic, I'm breaking the cycle. 

My husband (who I have almost left three or four times, most recently in June) has been superficially supportive, but lately has been making comments about how we don't have sex anymore and he's accepted that we'll ""always have a horrible sex life"" (I told him I was leaving him in June, he knows about the self-harm urges, I have a lot going on, sex isn't even on my radar, he works 20 hours a week and can jack off whenever he wants, I don't care) and how it's odd that I'm as stressed as I am. It felt like a straw that broke the camel's back moment. 

There have been warning signs that my stress levels are getting concerning, but this morning was different. 

I was in the median trying to cross two lanes of traffic to get to an onramp in the far right lane. The left lane of traffic was at a standstill, but a driver motioned for me to cut through. I couldn't properly see the middle lane I intended to cut across, though. I remember sitting in the median thinking, ""It would be so dangerous to blindly cross, you can't do it, you might hurt or kill someone, you might get hurt or killed, your car will be totaled, it would be your fault, you can't afford to do something that stupid, you can't ruin someone's health or life because you're stupid, wait until you can see.""

It felt like my mind left my body and I was suddenly a passenger. I remember feeling my foot lift from the brake and and being horrified, thinking about what a stupid irresponsible and dangerous move it was, how it was inexcusable, how I shouldn't do it as the car lurched forward. I truly didn't feel in control. I know I was, I accept full responsibility, but in the moment it didn't feel like a choice, I didn't feel in control. It was scary. 

If the oncoming car hadn't swerved at the last second, I would have been t-boned by a car going 55 mph, and there was no reason for it to happen. I've never done anything like that in my life. 

I don't know why but I just wanted to get it off my chest. I feel horrible about it."	animationzinecast	post	23.999391055371476	female	White	0.9944029450416565	na	na	na	5	offmychest	no prediction.
"Man. I felt this. 

I landed my “dream job” right after my daughter was born. We relocated to a major city with a 9 month old away from family. I had a brutal commute. Childcare cost more than our rent. And the office culture was toxic, overworked, burnt out mess. 

My wife did rideshare at night after we put kiddo to bed so we basically worked in shifts. We had no time for each other or ourselves. 

I started day dreaming about getting into an accident on my way to work - how it would be so nice to checkout. I think I probably wanted to be taken care of also. 

Right now you need to be kind to yourself. Support yourself like you would support someone else. 

This is not something you can criticize yourself for. This isn’t a mistake - it’s a crisis.

You need to talk to somebody and find ways to alleviate the pressures you're under because this really was not a safe situation and it can happen again, successful suicides are usually people who seemingly never gave any indication and it is often way more impulsive than planned, this doesn't sound like a random life-affirming call of the void scenario. The vast majority of people who go seeking help about their suicide plans aren't anywhere near as far along as you just were even if you aren't spending your days mulling it over, suicidal ideation doesn't actually mean you are suicidal so I'd definitely be more concerned about what you are telling me, that impulsive element needs addressing. People call it selfish, brave, crazy etc but I think sometimes there's just not a lot a person can do about it and that's very scary as you seem aware of when the moment passed, it's really about reducing the factors that led you to that and that requires honesty rather than trying to carry the world, nobody can carry the world.	animationzinecast	reply	na	na	na	0.9944029450416565	weak	no	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.

last year i was in a really bad space where i craved any attention i could get. i started flirting with people on snapchat, eventually i started talking to someone who had turned 14 a bit before. we started sexting and sending pictures and now realizing how gross the difference is in maturity is, is eating me up inside. i feel like a predator and even though she said she didn’t see any problem with our ages, im terrified that i’ve hurt her so bad and she’ll realize how gross it was as she grows older. 

i reached out a few months after apologizing sincerely, but when i mentioned i didn’t think i felt comfortable talking anymore, she seemed disappointed. i wish i could erase that whole period of time and i have no clue why i was so blind to how damaging of an age difference it was, but it keeps me up at night and i feel like a true pervert, even more so that i’m trans so i feel like i’m just giving into the agenda that all trans people are predators. i get worried that i’m making it all about me though, because i want to be there to help her but i know the only thing that can really help is to stay away.

i just don’t know how to move past this and i want to take it all back."	Practical_Button_394	post	14.653898720258825	male	White	0.9981682300567627	na	na	na	5	offmychest	no prediction.
It's a three year age difference. What is with gen Z and being obsessed over this? You didn't even do anything other than sext.	Practical_Button_394	reply	na	na	na	0.9981682300567627	no	no	strong	na	offmychest	no prediction.
"I think you should stay away and cut off all contact with her. Especially if you're turned 18 now, cuz she's a minor. It would be wrong to try to help her in any other way and stay involved with her.

That being said, it's still just 3 years difference and you were a minor when you were involved with her, I don't think this makes you a pedophile.

I did a little research on teens and pedophilia and: ""ICD-10 criteria stipulate that **the person with the disorder is at least 16 years old** and **at least five years older than the child or children who are the focus of their sexual preference**."" You can try to research more. It might be concerning if that 14 years old looked much younger for her age, and if you find yourself attracted to prepubescent kids (9-12 years old). Then consulting with the therapist would be the best thing.

Now, you mentioned that it's maturity that matters and I agree with that (especially now that you're 18). But thankfully you didn't do anything more than texting, and you were 17 back then (which is still a kid) and it was just 3 years difference. Now that you're an adult, you realize that it's morally wrong to get involved like that with a minor and this is important. 

Hopefully someone more knowledgeable gives a better answer, but if it's eating you so much and you're unable to move on, I suggest you talk to some adult about this, preferably a therapist if you have one, or maybe some adult in your family or a relative that you trust.

"For many many years I (M) always thought I was a shallow person. My preferences for women basically stop at fairly thin. I never find myself checking out anyone unless they have a reasonably attractive face either. And finally, and most importantly for this post I think (You'll see why), is I prefer a clear and soft voice. I don't really find much attraction to anything else and I've been upset with myself for this for a while. I've been struggling with myself thinking I'd never meet someone who I was attracted to because while I'm confident in myself, I'm definitely not a 10 and cant dish out what I'm hoping to get in return if you get me. I'm fully aware that looks don't matter to many people in the world and that my hard preferences are quite in the minority. I've tried to change and in doing so I ended up hurting someone who I never really felt any attraction towards hoping I could make it grow in time. I know, very selfish of me. We're friends still and the time we shared dating was beautiful but I know deep down that she didn't deserve that.  


  
All that said, along with my supposed deep rooted attraction limits I also want a partner that shares interests, someone who I can enjoy life with. I want someone who can pick me up when I'm down and someone who I can do the same for. Emotional and intellectual intelligence is also attractive to me but you can't find that on the surface of course. I want something comfortable where we can sit in silence for hours just knowing that each of us is happy to be with the other.  


  
Enter the lady I've been getting to know. We were chatting for a few weeks and while it wasn't on her profile she eluded to some form of physical disability though said it barely affects her life. Wanting to be respectful of her I figured I'd let her talk about it as she felt more comfortable. Disability in itself never bothered me much. I could have always seen myself dating someone who uses a wheelchair for example. In conversation she was so dynamic and we share so many things in common. Basically we hit it off great and I fell for her just over text. She was also fairly thin from her photos and while maybe not the prettiest face she's still quite lovely and has a few features I liked like her gorgeously light blue eyes. I felt that I may have a chance at love without hurting myself and someone else by going against my shallowness. We never really breached the topic of her disability and ended up meeting up for the first time a little bit ago. Walking up to me I could see she had a different gait and I thought that may be it. When she sat down and spoke however I immediately understood her disability having met a few people with it in the past. Cerebral Palsy manifests itself in so many unique ways and for her she has full mobility but is jittery and her speech is slurred making her words come out slower due to the effort she needs to put in to move her muscles. Because of this her facial movements are also very exaggerated changing her looks dramatically while she speaks.  


  
And... I don't care? This woman I met while checking basically all of my boxes on the personality level still goes against my deep rooted shallowness that I thought I'd never overcome. We had a lovely date, shared some very heartfelt things about ourselves (This topic not included) and I'm more excited than before to see her again. I didn't have this with my ex whom I fought against my shallowness for. In fact, after the date and thinking back, half way through the date I felt as though I no longer heard her voice the same as I did when we first sat down. I think I even picked up on some cute inflections she makes. While we were walking around and when seeing her interact with the world with her imprecise hand movements I didn't see someone wo was less than normal, I saw someone simply overcoming an obstacle. Her face, while it looks to struggle to get words out completely overflows with emotion especially when she laughs and my heart just melts. Yeah I'm pretty sure I like her lol.  


  
And now, I'm torn. Have I been able to overcome my shallowness? Is it still there but some of the things I thought were holding me back weren't actually there in the first place? I don't know. And I'm scared to hurt someone this wonderful and strong. Everyone deserves love even a shallow guy like me. I know that. But I don't want to take that love from someone who also deserves it too if this is just a fleeting thing for me.  


  
I've always blamed media for my preferences. Maybe real people enter my mind differently than the women on my screen. Maybe a close connection is what I've actually always needed and I never knew. I'm also not scared of any future difficulties she may have due to her condition. It's not degenerative but it takes a toll on the body and with that comes quicker breakdown of joints and such which means she may require some assistive device eventually. In any case, I needed to get this off my chest because my mind is just filled to the brim with things. We're still talking and have plans to meet up soon, and I plan on telling her about my thoughts if things start getting serious so she can choose to proceed and not be strung along. I think that's the best thing to do.

My (first time mom, 28f) baby is 6 weeks old and I have been exclusively breastfeeding her since birth. She nurses at-least 10-12 times a day, if not more.  She would take short naps and even at night her longest nap would be 2.5 hrs. I am terribly sleep deprived and do not get time to eat/ poop and bathe. I have constant headache, my boobs ache and my perineal stitches hurt till last week (also, had a bad case of UTI).

My MIL came to my house 2 weeks ago and yesterday she complained to my husband that I intentionally keep her grand daughter ‘away’ from her. My husband came storming in my room and said how hurt his mother is because I do not let his mother spend more time with the baby. I was shattered when he said that if I won’t be nice to his parents, our marriage will be over soon. 

I am not comfortable breastfeeding in front of anyone else other than my husband. I try my best to bring out the baby so that she can be with her grandma but that window is short. My MIL wakes up early and goes to bed early, she takes afternoon naps and goes for walks. We almost have opposite routines and the window when the baby is awake,fed and calm is so small.

My husband doesn’t help out a lot with the baby. His work is quite flexible and he works from home. He doesn’t wake up at night to help me with the baby or do diapers. He would hold the baby when he is free during the day so that I may eat and take a bath. His routine is hardly disrupted. He goes to the gym in the morning, plays video games and goes for other activities (playing tennis etc.)

I do all the other baby related chores like doing laundry, massaging and bathing and washing my Pumps.

"In the cesspit of modern dating, I've been slapped around by a ceaseless barrage of stress, demands, lies, and betrayals. The perpetual exhaustion gnawing at my soul stands as a testament to how these experiences have devoured my patience and hope.

Throwing more salt into the wound is the presence of dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa, a condition that taints every single moment with pain and vulnerability. While it's supposedly made me ""tougher,"" it's more of a relentless reminder of my limits. It's akin to stumbling through a minefield while hoping for a connection. Let's talk marriage and the burden of parenthood—I'm scrapping those notions entirely. The mere thought of having kids never sparked any intrigue within me, and the idea of getting hitched feels like a twisted joke. Oh, and let's not forget the delightful fear of losing my disability benefits if I were to tie the knot, which just throws another layer of absurdity onto this heap. In a world where trust has eroded into a fine dust, the pursuit of anything resembling a genuine relationship feels like chasing elusive specters. The chokehold of control that often accompanies marriage only ramps up my skepticism. My autonomy isn't something I'll willingly toss onto the altar of societal norms. Let's not mince words here or ladies don't take offense but..—the quality of women I've been surrounded by and involved with has played a significant role in shaping my perspective. The bottom-of-the-barrel caliber of these connections has driven home the fact that none of these struggles are remotely worth it. I've glimpsed the tranquility of solitude, relishing in the satisfaction of watching marriages crumble to pieces. Seeing the wreckage among my male counterparts, ensnared in the chains of family life and trapped in relationships reeking of infidelity, has only fueled my determination to steer clear of that train wreck. Procreation??? Seriously, in a world ruled by the stark reality of mortality, the idea of perpetuating the circle of life seems like a misplaced endeavor. The grotesque ugliness of the world throws a shadow over the notion of becoming a parent. Amid this bleak panorama, I adamantly refuse to morph into just another mindless conformist, blindly following the cookie-cutter template that defines life in my border town ciry in south Texas and beyond. Summing it all up, my personal saga, the gauntlet posed by my condition, and the introspection that colors my perspective have all woven together to forge an unyielding stance. Though this path of mine diverges wildly from society's norm, it's shaped by the crucible of bitter experiences. The principles of autonomy and authenticity are my North Stars as I navigate this shifting sea of ideals, forging a path uniquely my own. Is it bad that I never won in marriage or wanted kids and I feel sorry for those who have kids, married and don't seem happy? It just scares me and it just turns me off.i want to live my life 100% to the fullest especially with my condition.

"Rape is typically depicted as this awful thing that destroys the victim's life.  That's what I believed until it happened to me.  I didn't even realize I had been raped until the 3rd time it happened.  I still thought of rapists as awful people, but didn't really feel a thing after each incident.  I figured everyone processes it differently and I was just one of the lucky ones who wasn't affected by it.      

There were a lot of other things that I felt traumatized me a lot more so sexual assault was kind of on the back burner in my mind.  Every now and then I would get a flashback to the events and feel a little down, but overall I think I was too depressed and numb to care. Years later, it is now biting me back in the ass.  I'm taking a mood stabilizer for my supposed bipolar and I am no longer as numb.  It's awful.  I am feeling the full range of emotions that come with the intrusive memories.  I am now feeling all the things I used to be too depressed to feel.       

I'm kind of realizing all the ways it affected me now, like how I struggle to trust single men or form/keep friendships with them.  Also the crippling depression, panic attacks, and guilt/regret I now feel when I do happen to have thoughts of what happened.  I struggle with body image, exercise, and diet because I've formed some kind of connection between feeling good about myself and having bad things happen to me.  When I start feeling good about my body, I also get a lot more anxious which generally spirals my regular depression into full blown crippling depression.  Turns out I was not one of the lucky ones, I was just too young, dumb, and numb to emotionally react to what happened.

TL;DR:  I thought I was lucky to not feel anything about being raped.   Turns out I was too depressed and numb to feel anything at all."	Alt_amifucked	post	22.092268458702375	female	White	0.9965136647224426	na	na	na	1	offmychest	no prediction.

"My dad has been having anger issues since as long as I can remember. It's a big part of the reason why my parents broke up in 2011. After my parents split they decided that I would live with my mom and then spend 1 weekend with my mom and the other with my dad. During summer break I'd spent 3 weeks with my mom and 3 weeks with my dad. 

During those times he'd often scream at me, telling me how he wants to kill himself, curse a lot, calling my mom filthy names and blaming her for all his problems. I'd occasionally tell my mom about this whenever she asked me how my weekend was and she didn't let my dad see me on several occasions. 

He also drank a lot, he still does to this day. On friday nights we'd always go to one of the neighbours he was friends with where he'd get drunk and I'd usually sit around being bored or trying to hang out with the neighbours' son. 

It is also important to note that my dad has had money issues for years. Whenever I spent summer break at his place, he actually couldn't afford to take me on vacation. Yet we went camping atleast once a year and then spent the rest of summer break dealing with him complaining how he can't afford things.

My dad lost his job in 2011 or 2012 (I don't remember it that well) and didn't start working again until 2015. During that time he'd sleep a lot, doing the bare minimum and I often had to entertain myself or even make my own breakfast after a while. Even when he started working again, things didn't change much. Until last year 

Last year he stopped working again since it has become too much. He physically isn't able to work anymore due to copd (caused by his heavy smoking) and rheumatism. Because of this, he lost a lot of his income and still struggles a lot with money issues. This again causes him to be more annoyed and react this unto me.

I'm currently spending 3 weeks of summer break at his place and in all honesty, I'm done with it. I've given him way too many chances when things escalated. I tried my best to make him happy and to make him feel proud of me but I guess it's never enough. Everything is my fault or societies fault. Nothing I do is right. For the last 2 weeks he's been saying that if he loses his house, it's over. He been having suicidal thoughts and if he loses everything it will all be over. He said that I don't understand how serious the situation is, but in reality, I do. I just lost all sympathy. I'm done with him manipulating me, gaslighting me, making me feel bad and I genuinely think my life would be way better if he wasn't here."

"I came home from work with a horrible headache and just fell asleep in bed; I woke up and was told you had already been walked.

The next day you had a stroke, and it only got worse. We took you to the vet and had to put you down; I'm sorry I never went for the last walk. If I knew it was the last one, I would have stayed up and avoided the pain; I was told you sat outside my bedroom door just waiting for me, just me... But I never knew, and it hurts not seeing you again.

I'm glad I could be with you on your deathbed; I only wish I could walk you again, just one more time to make up for it.

I will always miss you.

Context: I lived with my mother, came home, and my head was hurting like never before, so I went into my room, lay down, and fell asleep. I always keep my door closed due to having an older cat that likes to pee everywhere, we usually walk the dog together, or my mother will do it, and he typically waits outside my door for me.

The next day he had a stroke and only got worse, so we took him to an out-of-hours vet who told us it wasn't good news and that this would be the only time I would get to see him.

He waited for me outside my bedroom door, and I was asleep. I never knew it was his last walk, and it hurt deeply."	c00kieguy	post	31.778095333931965	female	White	0.9862042665481567	na	na	na	2	offmychest	no prediction.

I'm just really annoyed at the minute because my bf is upset about me not telling him all of the people I kissed while I was clubbing, he said he thought I only kissed like 5 people but it was actually nearly 30. I get being insecure about it but he keeps making snide comments about it now and I'm getting frustrated. We've been together over a year now so it's been a long time since I did any of this and he's made jokes about me kissing a lot of people while clubbing before so I kinda thought he knew. I also didn't tell him I was talking to other people in the first week that he added me on snapchat. But if I'm being honest, I didn't even know he liked me at that point and I barely knew him. He asked me a couple weeks into talking if I was talking to anybody else and I said no because I wasn't. But apparently I should've told him that I was up until a week before that. Like no I answered your question, if you wanted to know more you should've asked me or how else am I going to know that you wanted more info? I told him about exes, people I've slept with and anyone I thought was relevant. I'm not going to mention everyone else who isn't important because that's pointless, it's the past. He's made me feel like I lied and cheated, and yes he used those words. But I haven't rly done anything wrong, I didn't think he'd want to know how many people I've kissed, I don't particularly want to know that about him but he's told me a lot of things about his past that I wish he didn't. I just don't want to know and I don't wanna put other people into our relationship. I get feeling insecure about it and we just think about things differently. But calling me a cheater is way too far. I barely knew him	babywiccan	post	16.355504594339386	female	White	0.9988418221473694	na	na	na	5	offmychest	no prediction.
"This may be a red flag that you might have to keep an eye on because either he's trying to imply that you were promiscuous in order to make you feel guilty/ashamed and wrong about your past.  If you feel guilty, it would better help him clamp more control over you.  Or, he's just not ready for an adult relationship as it sounds as if he's expecting something more of a fully adult person that enjoys affection and sex.  

There's nothing shameful about that.

"Just need to vent for a bit, I'm barely keeping it together day to day and I'm losing my mind.

I am just so tired of being useless, unloved, and lonely. I have no friends, I am currently unemployed, and I feel so unsafe and unloved in my environment/with my family.

I have been trying to find friends for a long time now, a place where I belong, but it is genuinely just so hard. I've spent several years at college in my lifetime and have never had anyone even take any real interest in me, never made any friends or connections. Even if I go out shopping, or go to see a movie, or just go out to get some food, I feel so invisible and unwanted in every interaction I have, like no one even really sees me. I just don't get how people do it, making friends and meeting others. I feel so ostracized and hated everywhere I go and in every interaction I have. I have social anxiety but it's honestly just been getting worse and worse every year with every failed attempt I make to socialize and make friends. It feels like I'm falling down an endless pit. I feel like I've never be wanted or loved or appreciated because I've never felt that I have.

I have been unemployed since september, and before that I didn't have a permanent job since 2021 january. Honestly, it's frustrating and tough. I have no skills valuable anywhere outside of fast food or grocery stores. I've tried to go to school several times and haven't graduated with any because I've always felt forced and pressured by my parents to do something but I have no idea what I want to do and I've never had any direction or assistance, well if I have then none of it has worked. I'm also just SO SICK of people constantly suggesting the trades like it's the perfect job field for everyone. It isn't going to make my life better and it isn't helpful advice to give then to call someone lazy or entitled when it isn't for them. My whole family just want me to do trades, it's all they talk about. I've had to lie to my parents about going to a college because I don't feel safe letting them know that I simply don't want to go to school because I have no idea what I want to do and I don't want to do trades. I have no interest in the trades and don't want to go into a job field I am certain I will never like. I also am just simply not physically or mentally capable(I have anxiety and depression issues, and pretty bad scoliosis, also I'm really weak and find it hard to work out) or suited for the trades, but I still just have no idea what I want to do. I wasn't raised being exposed to different stuff and I wasn't exactly pushed to succeed or be a well lived person... I also have no connections or friends to help me out and help me get a job. I have no skills or aspirations. I have been looking for a job since september 2022 and I've had one in-person interview and one phone interview and they both went nowhere. I feel so worthless and empty. Like, is it even worth trying? I can't even get min. wage jobs that are local or anywhere really. I've even been working with an employment help service and I haven't found a job through them yet. I know that as time goes on my chances of getting a job just get lower and lower, I feel like I'm just doomed. I'm in debt and it's only getting worse and I have literally no money and no options for making money.

Doesn't make it worse than I just fear for my future overall. There's so much doom and gloom globally about it becoming more and more expensive to live and it's really stressing me out but I can't stop looking. I need to be informed about how the world is doing and if it's getting better, but of course it never is, so it just stresses me out more. I live in a very expensive area of my country and obviously I can't move, not that it would help, because I have no money. 

I still live with my parents but they support me with the bare minimums. They're both also very bigoted and hateful, I just can't listen to them anymore. Shouting at each other, talking bad about groups of people they don't like or despise. It's rotting my brain and it's just too much to listen to it all the damn time. My parents used to be physically and verbally abusive(maybe a little bit of emotional abuse)  but now they're just verbally abusive and I don't feel safe, but obviously I can't leave. I have nowhere to go and I feel somehow chained to this environment, probably because of the promise of shelter and food. My parents don't support me on anything and are expecting me to both do everything alone and also succeed without failure. I fear abuse from them every day and it doesn't help my overall situation at all.  I'd leave if I didn't already know it wouldn't change anything, in fact it'd make things worse.

I just feel like giving up. Living is just too much pain and the amount of effort to just get up, shower, and eat some breakfast. I am starting to lose sleep again too and I don't think it's helping my health at all. Every day I go to sleep I want to not wake up. My life is a waste, I'm a failure and no one cares about me really. No one knows I exist so if I disappeared I wouldn't be missed."

"Please don’t give up..I’ve struggle for a long time before and know how it feels. I’ll try to give you the best advice I can: 

-therapy or psychiatry (all virtual, it feels good to actually say what you’re feeling out loud once you get used to it) 

-hobbies (find a hobby you enjoy and you will run into other with the same hobbies, ex. Pottery, take a pottery class?)

I know it’s not easy, at all. Social anxiety makes it worse. Sometimes if I’m anxious and don’t know what to say to people I just start with “hey how’s your day going?” Or just ask them questions about themselves and get to know them. People love talking about themselves and they’ll feel heard from your conversation. 

As far as shelter goes, have you considered getting help through your state? I know it’s not ideal but theres income based housing depending on your area. Some other things may be food stamps or cash assistance? 

I don’t want to type too much but taking care of yourself should be the first priority. Everything else can come after that. Please don’t be discouraged to reach out for help financially or mentally.

If you are in Ontario Canada there is free therapy options for adults (I Have used them.) They are all behind Doctors Refferrals (or a Social workers refferals). You would need to make an Appointment with your General Practitioner (Family Doctor) and discuss with them of what local options are in your area. The more rural you are the more difficult it will be to find something, but it you are close to a big city then there is quite a few options. (Especially in the GTA).

I'm a 21M. I used to use Omegle and honestly used it for probably like 100 hours easily. I was jobless and needed something to connect to the outside world. But I just did too much. Like I talked to a 16 year old girl for like an hour, but not with any intentions. Just talking. Looking back thats pretty weird. Or I talked to a lot of English girls like 16-20. Again not with any intentions like I never asked for snap or made any move. Just talking. But still weird, I should have skipped immediately. I wish I could change a lot of things in my life but I can't. I wish I led with love not hate and pride. I was so bitter using Omegle and was just making a fool out of myself.

"Here I go complaining again, I just don’t have anyone to talk to about my relationship problems at the moment. 

I’ve (24f)  told my boyfriend (24m) several times that it is important for me to get a hug & kiss when I come home, and preferably some quality time to talk about our day at work/spent apart. He should know this about me. I talk a lot and I understand he needs peace and quiet sometimes, but when I come home I am usually excited to see him again and talk to him. He usually yells ”hello honey” or something like that from his gaming chair. I wish he would get up and greet me at the door and ask me about my day. We usually don’t hug and talk if I don’t initiate/engage. He might give me a hug a while after I’ve come home. 

I also recently went on a small trip out of the country with my family, when we game back home  we decided to surprise him at work and bring him the gifts we got for him (he works in a restaurant and there were almost no one there at the time). When he saw us, he looked happy, said hello and then continued teaching his colleague something. I tried giving him a side hug, but no reaction. He didn’t come to check on us at our table until his shift ended about 40 minutes later. Even my parents commented that he was being EXTRA distant that day. I brought it up to him afterwards when we went home, saying that we understand if he was busy, but certainly he can pay us attention for 2 minutes to say hello. It just turned into an argument because he thinks I don’t understand his work position. One of his colleagues that we are good friends with even came out and gave us big hugs and greeted us."	throwaway78987543ra	post	19.925170768606332	male	White	0.9984180927276611	na	na	na	1	offmychest	no prediction.

Okay, I'm probably wildly exaggerating and reading too much into it, but if I may ask... Is this the only issue you have in relationship? Does he communicate with you properly? Did he say anything about you giving him a side hug later when you talked (for example ""hey, you shouldn't do that when I'm working"" or ""sorry, I was in the middle of work"") or did he just completely ignore it and never addressed it? At all?

Does he ever acknowledge that he ignored your requests? In any way? Like ""sorry, I was playing a game so couldn't get up to greet you""? You said you two never talk if you don't initiate it. When you initiate it, what do you talk about? Does he show interest in your life? Does he listen to you when you're talking about your stuff and problems, or he only talks and pays attention when it's about him? Does he acknowledge when you talk about your needs, or he absolutely ignores you and dismisses you, and then gets angry if you're trying to stick to the topic?

Is he attentive to you? Does he take responsibility for his actions or he always has some excuse/explanation? Do you feel like it's one-sided and that you're just giving while not receiving anything?

Again, I'm probably exaggerating here, but when you wrote ""I tried giving him a side hug, but no reaction"", this reminded me of something I've experienced. Like, did he give no reaction at all in that moment or maybe later? Not angry, not annoyed, nothing?"	throwaway78987543ra	reply	na	na	na	0.9984180927276611	weak	strong	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.

I hope you guys don’t mind me providing a update. So like I said in the last post, after my sister threatened the mistress that if she tried to expose the affair to others that she would get the police involved  and my niece cussed her out, the mistress messages a lot of family members and friends of the family including friends of my sister exposing the affair. The messages included screenshots of the messages between my brother and law and the mistress for the past 3 years. Very sexually explicit messages and messages of him expressing his love and dedication to her. Before my my sister threatened the mistress, my BIL told my sister and niece that the mistress might try to expose their messages through social media; so my niece and sister blocked the mistress immediately so they wouldn’t see or hear anything from her. I warned them that threatening the mistress might make things worse or make her angrier. The girl was calm until my sister threatened tned her. The mistress even messaged the church with the messages as well. The church has suspended my BIL from his duties as deacon and an elder pending an investigation of her claims they will be taking a official statement from my brother in law and the girl. 

The blackmail my brother in law was referring to was that Whenever  the mistress and him got into arguments she would threaten to tell his wife. But my BIL still stayed for 3 years. They were having sex in my sisters home while she was out of town every weekend taking care of our sick mother. In my nieces bedroom that she grew up in. My sister had told the mistress that she is staying with her husband and will try to forgive him; and that’s exactly what she’s gonna do. The day the affair was exposed my sister had my BIL block her number and change his. And my BIL sent a cease and desist letter to the mistress through a law firm. Telling her not to contact him, our family members or the church or he will file a restraining order. Well that didn’t work either; exposed him even more and I don’t think he can press charges for her telllin ppl the truth.

1.Can a marriage survive something like this?
2.  Will the marriage ever be the same?
3. Why would she stay? I don’t agree on it. At all. I could never trust him again and I would be so embarrassed.
4. And why do my niece and sister refuse to look at the text messages exchanged between the two of them. I would want to know.

I want to be there for my sister. To know what she might be going though or feeling. How can a marriage survive something like this. My BIL knew this girl had abandonment issues and grew up in a abusive household. He treated her like s girlfriend telling her he’s in love with her and want to always be with her."

I know what my coworkers (and i) bring for lunch at work is nobody elses business but theirs but i can’t help feeling crappy about what i bring vs my coworkers. I’m the biggest employee on my team of 4 and i always bring a bigger lunch. It doesn’t even seem like THAT big, it’s mostly like a cup of noodles or a sandwich and pretzels or some kind of snack like that. Today i brought a lox bagel, pretzels and yogurt which doesn’t sound like much but it always feels like i’m eating the most which is bringing up ancient insecurities. My coworkers will eat something like a granola bar, or an apple, and that’s it. And they can function the whole day with only that. I just can’t help but feel so crappy about myself especially knowing that’s my lightest meal.	tmsdnr	post	13.509413172354614	male	White	0.9989070892333984	na	na	na	5	offmychest	no prediction.

"My uncle is about 6 feet tall and built like a bean pole...it's a family joke that he has two hollow legs where his food goes so he can eat two more plates.

My nephew when he was a skinny 12 year old had two HUGE plates of food and wanted a third.  

Not everyone eats the same.  

As big as I am, I've found that I fill up incredibly fast just by talking.  If I'm sitting eating a burger, fries and drink...and talking, half the time I can't finish my meal because I feel stuffed. 

Try eating a big breakfast before work; have several snacks tucked away in your desk drawer (oatmeal bars, power bars, etc).  Maybe that'll help?

You may need to learn to ignore what your co-workers are eating for your own self-esteem issues.

"My husband and I \[47M and 47F\] were finally able to play out our pregnancy roleplay fantasy a couple days ago! My husband has always been very expressive of his love for and attraction to my body - pre, post, and during pregnancy (we've had 3 kids) - which makes me feel super loved and desired. 

He was always really into pregnancy sex and he has a thing for taking care of me, so we'd been talking about doing a full on pregnancy roleplay. We ordered a fake pregnancy belly and my husband got a few of the foods I had major pregnancy cravings for (pickled daikon, fudgsicles, wheat thins, and chive and onion cream cheese), and we pretended I was pregnant again. He pretended he had come home from the grocery store, gave me a foot massage while I ate some of my craving foods, then ate me and we made love. 

It was really fun and sexy! It felt like a blast to the past and it was really lovely to live out that part of our lives again. Once we're back home we'll be trying it again, I'm sure."

"     I messed up.  I wanna start by saying that, this was 8 months ago so I’ve finally made my peace with it. I’m not looking for any judgement or criticism, I know what I did was wrong no matter what was going on at the time.  I have gone through periods of guilt and anger (for letting it happen), please read all of this to fully understand what happened.

    I met my best friend’s boyfriend, K, while they were dating.  We went skating with a bunch of friends and I invited K, then finally really got to know him a couple weeks later when we went to a party together (one that he brought his best friend to so that they could hook us up together).  Anyways, we occasionally talked to each other and he mostly helped me try to date his friend.

     We didn’t really talk after the break up between K and my bestie, M.  Only a couple messages about the friend I was trying to date and some tips about him.  This really all started when I got wasted on New Years Eve and snapped K, he suggested we call.  I was absolutely out of it and I don’t remember anything about that night, but it must have gone well because he asked me out the day after.

     K and I talked throughout the week and set something up for the next weekend.  I finally got to talking to my best friend a couple of days before our “date”, and she told me it was fine expect he was dating another one of her friends.  This was new to me as I knew nothing about him having a girlfriend.  Anyways, I messaged him and we switched our date to a hangout (big mistake).

     The day of the “hangout” comes around and I’ve set it up so that we go ice skating (cause I’ve been skating since I was 6).  K shows up on time, we skate, and go out for some food nothing crazy.  This is where things start to go wrong.  The way he’s speaking to me is definitely not one that was just friendly.  The way he interacted with me was absolutely and clearly in a flirty manor.  I was not in the greatest mental state at the time, as I had just gone through a big break up and had a bunch of mental health issues (not a good excuse).

     Anyways, the biggest issue was when he asked me to go back to his place to watch a movie and I said yes.  We did just that and sat on the couch. I tried to create as much space as possible between us with pillows, but he just took them all away and laid in my lap.

     I eventually ended up kissing him (biggest mess up) and making out with him knowing that he had a girlfriend.  He tried to do more but at that point I did stop him.  I left soon after feeling a weird mix of guilt and happiness (as I had stupidly developed feelings for him).

     K cut contact with me, which probably in the long run was a good idea but at the time it hurt.  As he was the first person I had opened myself up emotionally to, I shut down emotionally and was distant from others.  I never really talked to him again, I saw him every once in a while through mutual friends.  What he did really hurt me weirdly.  It made me feel like I was a horrible person (which I definitely was, I completely disrespected my best friend and her friend), but now thinking on it I just realize how I let outside forces influence my decisions.

     Since then I quit drinking and realized that I would never let something like this happen to me again.  I got my shit together and learned to talk to someone about my feelings instead of expressing them in an unhealthy manner.  I am finally in a place where I can say that I’m ok that this happened and I learned so much from it.  It has truly made me better even if it put me through emotional hell."

"after seeing this person for about three months now, we sat down and had a conversation about what our future looks like. this was sparked by the fact that this person went on a trip recently and ended up kissing several different people at a party, after i thought we agreed upon being mutually exclusive. 

while they were honest with me about what they did, i had to pry a little to get them to tell me this information. ultimately, i feel hurt and sorta cheated on. while they empathized with me and told me they understand my perspective, i don't recall receiving any form of an apology.

with this aside, i'm also working towards my doctorate which means i've been quite busy lately. this was one of the main concerns they brought up in conversation, since i haven't had much time to spend outside of school, which makes it difficult to sustain a relationship. with this in mind, they said that it would be best to part ways.

i genuinely did like this person a lot and was ready to look past the whole kissing situation, so i feel hurt that they were willing to come to the conclusion that we weren't going to work out. but it's okay, i will learn to heal."	1jnh23	post	10.791959607107872	male	White	0.9963202476501465	na	na	na	3	offmychest	no prediction.

i have been recently going to a café a lot to get away from my abusive family and as a distraction from life in general (and because they have free wifi), i usually dont order anything and just sit down and scroll through reddit for hours until i feel like going back home, anyways i was sitting down as usual and a woman came up to me and asked me if i am ordering anything and i told her no and she asked me if i can go to a different seat, i was a little annoyed but to be fair i kinda wasnt ordering anything anyways (and she brought a lot of food so i am assuming she bought it for herself and someone she is waiting for to come), anyways i sat somewhere else and continued scrolling through reddit (when i sit i usually just lean my head on my arm with my phone under the table because its more comfortable to me), i dont know if she thought i was sad or thought i was homeless (lets just say fashion isnt my strong suit lol) or whatever it may be, but after like 30 minutes she comes to me again and to my surprise she bought me a donut! she even offered to buy me a drink or another donut if i didnt like the one she bought me but i told her no i am okay and ate the donut she bought me, this has made my mood a lot better :)	RevolutionaryPop2262	post	20.987367910997424	female	White	0.0013011773116886616	na	na	na	1	offmychest	no prediction.

"Hey y'all, I just need to vent. Kind words are appreciated but I need a space to complain. I don't need advice or anything like that.

A couple of weeks ago, I applied for a better job. I got a call from the recruiter and we went over some basic questions, salary, experience, etc.

He set up a virtual interview with the hiring manager. I nailed it. The hiring manager then set up an in person interview. I nailed that one too. I got the call last week about an offer. It was 2k above what I asked for initially.

I'd like to say I was excited. But I wasn't. I felt pretty nonchalant about the whole thing. For background, I don't have a college degree but I have a experience in the field I'm in. The salary they offered me for no degree felt unreal. It felt like a trick, like they were at any point gonna be like, ""sike! You fucking THOUGHT."" 

I have to go through a pretty rigorous background check. I may have lied about dates on my resumé to make it look like I was at a job a couple of months longer than I was. I also said I had an associates when I was actually 3 classes shy of graduation. 

Yes, I know it's wrong to lie on your resumé, for reasons just like this. I didn't think they'd be doing such a thorough background check. I figured a lot of people lie about dates and titles and whatnot, so why can't I? I had mostly been applying for jobs similar to mine and nothing federal, state or county level, so I figured I was in the clear. But now, now I'm terrified they're going to rescind the offer. I already completed a physical and drug screen. I'm just waiting on my background check, which can take up to 3 weeks.When I filled out the background check information, I put the actual information on there. I didn't lie on the background check, just on my resumé.

The reason I feel like the universe wants me to fail is because a few months back, my mom lost her job. Then last month, my partner AND his brother lost their jobs. Then this month my mom's husband lost his job. I sent my mom money to pay her mortgage, because she was getting unemployment but it wasn't enough and she can't withdraw her 401k without paying massive penalties. She's been saving for almost 20 years. She's the bread winner and her husband doesn't make enough to support them. I have a decent savings account and I do alright for myself, living on my own. I wanted to help her, because if it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be where I'm at. She's done so much for me in the last couple of years. I owe nearly all of my progress to her.

My partner got a job offer for a factory here in town, making pretty great money. His brother, who has stage 3 lung cancer, got a job at a gas station. They're both set to move in later this month. Their rent is going up and while they'll be able to afford the increase, the apartment isn't worth the increase. I have a spare room anyway and my rent is also increasing, so it's a good move all around.


On top of that, I had a nasty fight with a colleague of mine today. I haven't been able to relax at all. I'm carrying so much tension in my shoulders, my stomach hurts, and because of my IBS, I've pooed 5 times today from all of the anxiety. My partner wants me to quit my job, but we're waiting on his background check to clear as well. He'll know his start date once that and the drug test clear. He said he'll be able to afford the bills if I decide to quit, and I have enough in savings to support myself for a month while we're waiting on him to get paid.

I just... I feel trapped. I feel like the universe is telling me to leave my job, but also, like I'm going to fail this background check and be left jobless. I have the money to keep my personal bills paid for a while, but I don't want to dip into my savings unless I have to. But with everything that happened today, I feel like I have no other choice but to quit. For background, I work with some pretty shitty people. They're always talking shit on everyone and the culture is all around toxic. I will admit I participate in the shit talking, but they take it to a whole new level, attacking people's physical features and shortcomings, agreeing they hate anyone new unless the new person is deemed worthy of their acceptance. I try to stay away from everyone, but be nice enough to stay in their good graces, so they don't make my job a living hell.

This increase in pay with the new job would allow me to save and help my mom out while she looks for a better job. My partner and his brother moving in would lower my bills too, so I'd have more money to do what I need to do. I don't know if I should quit or just deal with whatever repurcussions from my argument with my colleague today. I'm not quitting to get out of taking accountability. I want to quit because I fucking *hate* that place and the people in it. I feel like there's a spotlight on me and the moment I do anything I'm not supposed to, it's just another tally in their book of why I'm a shitty employee, while everyone else is allowed to do whatever the fuck they want. 

I just can't accept that something good can happen to me, because so many shitty things have happened. It feels like at any moment, the rug is going to be pulled out from under me. Maybe I'm guilty of self sabotage, I don't know. I'm dreading going back to work tomorrow. I won't have to see the guy I had it out with till Sunday but I'm just so terrified of getting fired, even if there's really no reason to fire me.

"I tried to post it with a throwaway but it kept getting deleted.

A good amount of you guys would want to strangle me after reading this. I'm an asshole in this story and I know it. No need to remind me.
  

  
So there's this girl (16F) who I know has liked me for a while now. She isn't particularly unattractive but she definitely isn't attractive either. I don't see her as a potential gf or anything like that. Most people don't like her, because she's rather clingy. Personally I don't mind her, and I'm usually friendly to her. Perhaps that's why she caught feelings for me.
  

  
As many of you have no doubt experienced, hormones in the teenage body are cruel. She came over to my family's house for a week and I decided to use the opportunity to ""get it off."" Before this we had been sexting a bit. After everybody went to bed, we came downstairs alone. We were watching something, but that quickly devolved into my hands on her legs and then she was sitting on me, rubbing her ass all over. This is also my first kiss, but it doesn't count because I don't want it to count. The kisses also didn't feel good, they were extremely wet and my lips were dry.
  

  
Neither of us took off clothes. I knew for a fact she wanted us to, but I have a bit of self control, and I knew that the second those clothes were off, neither of us would be virgins anymore. At some point she was licking me and it honestly felt disgusting, but I didn't want to let her know. Like I said, she isn't attractive, but she's made fun of in school for it. If I pointed out the parts that sucked it would have destroyed her self esteem, and she has exams approaching. I couldn't bring myself to do it.
  

  
At the end she pulled off my shorts and licked my penis, and started giving me a hand job. She was using my penis like a damn gear stick. I didn't show any pain, but I slowly got her off me. Luckily, we're both Christians so I was able to use that as an excuse for why we shouldn't do this and that we should stop. Also I'm off to university in about a week and she's about to start her final year of high school.
  

  
The entire experience sucked. I have to go for confession obviously, but I'm not even feeling the usual post-nut clarity that comes with masturbating. I feel like a good part of the reason it sucked is that I don't have any emotional attachment to her at all. By extension, I now know that hooking up isn't for me.
  

  
Obviously she's a bit hurt by all this, so, I'm asking for some advice on what I could do to ease that. I don't hate her, I promise. I don't even regret the incident - at least it's taught me something. You may hate me, which is fine, but please do it for her."

I've known since I was 7 that I'd always have my sister living with me, due to her disability. As I got older though I realized this extended to having to help my mom as well, she doesnt make enough to be on her own. It's nice cause I can save a bit of money. Not enough to move out and help though. 

I bring this up because I know it's seen as a burden or baggage. Most people don't understand and it's not ideal. 

I'm also a midget, which does hinder things as well. People tend to not look at me as a suitable partner. 

There's been flings I've had. It's ussually great for a few weeks to a month, but after that it goes down hill. We stop talking as much. Idk if it's cause they like the attention or I self sabotage subconsciously, waiting for it to end. 

Most recent everything was good. Then all of a sudden the talking was less and felt like I was putting in more effort then they are. Then they message me saying they miss me but idk what to say. Everything I try to talk about gets shorter replies. This happens every time I start talking to someone. 

I'm happy most of the time by myself. Sometimes I would like to have someone by my side. To be affectionate with. Go on dates and such. 

Just feels like I'm meant to not have a partner.  Ussually it doesn't bother me but times like right now it hurts."	kadfax	post	14.472771533351516	male	White	0.9978979825973511	na	na	na	1	offmychest	no prediction.

I’m content with life. I love my better half. I will marry him one day. I love his family. I just spent the day with his family and I felt so at home. I haven’t hung out with my family in years because parents divorced and I lost contact with my maternal family (that I liked) and today after nearly a decade, I felt that same giddy homey kind of feeling. They’re my chosen family. We talked, laughed, baked, played games. It was beautiful. He adds so much to my life. I hope I can one day express what he means to me. I can’t even put it into words. I am the luckiest person for having met him. I feel so emotional today. I love being a part of his clan on every festival, every fortnightly dinner, every birthday, every anniversary. I’ve fit into his life so effortlessly, and he into mine. The key to a lock. My angel.

"So one time before I was with my girlfriend I had sex at a party while drunk.

And she asked me if I would be able to control myself and not have sex with some one else. And I said yes I can control myself 

I returned the question and said she probably couldn’t. I don’t know how to feel about it. I know it hasn’t happened but I don’t wanna wait around for a party to come and then having my heartbroken at that time. I just want to know if I can trust her not to do it or even think about even when she’s drunk

We don't let alcoholics use alcohol as an excuse when they plow into a family and take out a little one. It's not an excuse to cheat either.

Some people are angry drunks, some are stupid, blabbing, stumbling idiots and some are the uncontrollably horny kind.

It's the lack of self-control that some people have when drinking that should be quelled. If she can't put the ""I'm spoken for"" flag up (and she knows it) and still drinks to the point of her losing control over it then hey, she's one of those people who can't handle the drug.

Sorry, it sucks hearing what you did, but at least she's honest.

I think ppl look at trust the wrong way, ppl say you cant trust someone when in reality you dont have to trust them more than you trust your own decisions...if she tells me she may cheat then i trust she will if that's what i decide cheating is: the relationship you develop between you and your spouse is just that, what yall decide is fair in the relationship is solely up to yall; cheating is the broken loyalty one has for you i.e. you choosing someone over me romantically, physically, mentally, emotionally etc. Because loyalty is the foundation in which your trust is build upon, i am loyal to this person because they got me and understand me no matter the circumstances granted that don't mean to be abusive towards em but that they will still choose you at the end of it all, if yall not built like that don't get involved otherwise why force someone to act accordingly when they aren't willing?

"I know I make bad decisions when I drink rum and cannot be trusted. As a result, I don't drink rum.

Is this self-awareness, or is it a preemptive excuse? Does she drink in mixed company? Does her typical behavior lend itself to being in situations in which she can't be trusted?

It's not a deal breaker without context. With context, it could be a major issue or a non-issue. 

If the likelihood of the situation is high, maybe have a chat about how to avoid the situation. If she doesn't want to change her habits, perhaps it's best to break it off while you can do so amicably.

"How come anytime you ask people why God hasn’t answered your prayers either its your fault… or you should just be grateful?

I’ve been praying and praying and trying to serve God… for him to do nothing in return. Not heal my epilepsy even though people have prayed for my healing a thousand times. Not get me out of my parents house when this environment literally makes me want to kill myself. Literally if I could just get away. But my epilepsy keeps me from everything.

My dad wouldn’t let me go to college. I had to quit working full time because I have seizures when ever I work that much. And even then when I was working that full time job and I was so close to leaving all the prices on everything went up by hundreds of dollars anyway. Then my seizures came back. 

I’m so sick of living. I have spent so much of my life begging and envisioning a better life. Whether I had to work for it or whatever and now I don’t want anything.

So a bit of background, I’ve been married twice. Both times were when I was active duty with my head up my ass. Granted I may be in the same boat as I was a few years ago. I (27m) are dating a 50 year old Latina. We’ve been dating for a few months, I’m very happy with her so far and vice versa. She owns a sandwich shop in the town I work in so if I’m not too busy I get to see her for a little bit. I stay at her house often and we always have a great time, plus she teaches me Spanish since she doesn’t speak English lol. 
(Sorry to ramble) 

Anyways she met my parents and they were not thrilled. My gf is in the same age group as my parents (still younger) but still that’s besides the point. we all went out to lunch together and I thought we had a good time. I went to her place after and spent the night there. Since then (3 days) my parents don’t really talk to me now, I know it’s because of my situation but I feel it’s a bit dramatic to not talk about this."

"I just really wanted to be touched and experience physical intimacy with someone. I chose him because he seemed big and tough and like hed make me feel small. I messaged him and asked if he wanted to hook up and he said yeah so I went over to his bleak dark apartment and we did. We used protection. He finished before I came. When I asked if he could finish me off he told me he was more a “one shot kinda guy.”
He wouldnt touch me after. 

I dont know if I would feel worse if I actually liked his personality. Hes a hipster who hates hipsters. 
He’s like this grumpy old man with a chip on his shoulder, acting like he’s the only one in the world whos ever had his feelings hurt and will waste no time telling you about anyone who’s ever wronged him. 

Even though he didnt make me cum and he pretty much all around sucks, the sex wasn’t bad. The sex was actually pretty fun. He was working with some quality material. I loved the way his face lit up when I told him he was hot and that he was doing *so* good. But now I feel really gross. Like, spiritually. I use to do shit like this sporadically in my early twenties but I thought I had grown out of it. I was just craving sex today and I thought I was mature enough to handle the emotions that came with it but I cant help feeling rejected and ashamed. But what am I supposed to do? Wait years for sex with the right guy? Im horny. 

I hope one day I can have the kind of Sunday sex where I wake up next to my man, we make love, unprotected-because our bodies belong to each other, go grocery shopping and spend the rest of the day cooking and making love some more.

"Dates are important even for just casual sex. When I was a casual person the best method I found was to go for a non-alcoholic drink date. Boba, coffee, smoothies, and things like that. That way you can offer to pay, or if they don’t want you to pay no one is out anything more than the price of a drink. You can tell a lot about a situation by the way they drink. If you find someone drinking fast and not talking a lot, they’re usually not committed to the experience. In this case your only out a drink which can be finished fast or taken on the go really easily. Someone who is engaged in interacting with you and drinks a steady pace is usually someone who will commit to the experience. The best casual encounters I’ve had were when we met up, talked for a while, ordered drinks, talked some more, finished drinks, hangout, and then before the awkward silence (which will always come inevitably) you say something like “we should go chill *insert place.”

Edit: I also want to add that going out for one drink is way better than going out for food because casual activities feel a lot more fun if you don’t have a full stomach, plus post sex food hits better on an empty stomach."

Ok so everyone just advised about waiting for a romantic partner so I am gonna do the opposite cause it doesn’t help next time you’re horny. Next time do a bit of a sexual vibe feel before you even exchange numbers. Sexual attraction is a must but to me safety is even more important and sexual compatibility as well. Try and test the waters first do a little sexting see how he behaves. Is he creative? Does he go straight to fucking even in text form? Does he talk about your pleasure? Is he a giving lover? When he says something you don’t like say don’t do that and see how he behaves and responds. There’s so much you can test for with just a simple chat that doesn’t even last long but saves you the trouble of having sex with men who should never be allowed access to a woman again.

"I'm sorry this happened to you. Unfortunately, many women have probably experienced this. Women's pleasure has always been repressed, not discussed, or not thought of by many men. Most men (in my experience) don't care to ask or think about if the girl was pleased in the same way. They usually assume and assume wrong.
As someone who has never intentionally had an ONS or committed to the FWB thing but experienced this feeling in past relationships, I was hesitant about trying it. But having recently gone through a lot of stress and finding myself wanting for sex, I decided to try it last week. And it went well. I made sure to ask a lot of questions before agreeing to sex though. I recommend you do this next time if you want a hookup. That way, you know what you're getting into.
For example, ask all the important/deal-breaking questions up front and make sure u get a clear answer on all. ""ONS or FWB? Cuddling and kissing after sex? Do you eat 🐈? You supply and wear condoms? You clean?"" Etc these were deal breaking questions for me. I ended up finding out the guy I had sex with didn't like or do oral, which was very disappointing. But at least I knew before going into it. And it made it easier for me not to want more with him, as that is a requirement for me and my future partner. I also made it clear that I won't reciprocate much in return unless it benefits me. FWB requires both ppl to get benefits after all. And as a woman in my 30s, I know what I want and won't settle for less, as every woman should feel.

"One thing I've learned about men is when it comes to friends with benefits they dgaf about the friends part. They will take the benefits & pretend like they're being a good friend. If they're still treating you like a friend afterwards that's bc they either secretly like you, or they're that tiny percentage of men who actually understand that they just need to be a good friend too. Idc what man argues this, it's absolutely true. In my experiences, my friends experiences... This is how it's always been. I don't blame you for feeling the way you do. Since this guy sounds really annoying as a human being (the hipster shit & acting as if he's the only person who's ever felt pain 🙄🙄🙄) you might have taken on some of his energy & that's why it's bugging your spirit other than just having casual sex. You sound like the kind of person who needs emotional connection for that, & that's okay! I'm the same as you. I tried casual sex with a few friends before, & it never ended well bc my emotions would be so caught up in myself, or id truly start believing I actually liked the guy when in reality I didn't. I intentionally tried the hook up thing with two different guys. One I barely met to see if that was the key. Nope. I felt disgusted by my actions, & later on found out the guy was a loser fucking his boss who pays his bills & was on meth 🤮🤮🤮 I was like WOW no wonder I felt so disgusted afterwards! I immediately cut him off after abandoning the ""friend"" part & told him to go fuck himself. I figured ""okay let's try someone I trust that I've been friends with for years."" & I did. He stayed my friend afterwards, & we were cool, but LAWD the sex was so boring. It sucked. I had to pull out my vibrator at the end cuz I just wasn't finishing. I didn't want to be mean considering he had been my friend for about 9 years, but it just wasn't fulfilling. I realized I was the girl who could only have sex when there are feelings involved on both sides. This whole hook up culture is not my thing.


Sorry I went on such a long spew of my experience lol, but I just felt like I could relate to what you're talking about & how you're feeling. It sucks being horny all the fucking time, but no one consistent or trustworthy enough to fuck.

This was you re-learning what your boundaries are for the person you are today. Like you said, you thought you could handle it because you did in your early twenties. What might feel dirty isn’t the act itself, like you mentioned above - but what you need from the other to feel good afterwards. The way he handled it was pretty selfish and only focused on himself, not you. I had a similar incident like this in my life once that sent me into a spiral a few years ago because I felt so dirty, my therapist at the time helped me reframe what happened and why I felt so grossed out by how my body felt.

I think you feel grossed out cause you realized he basically used you like an object and didn’t care about you at all. He also sounds kinda gross and not very appealing and your rose-horny glasses wore off after the sex to see him as he really is.

I know what you mean- getting divorced and been separated for about 18 months now- living apart anyway. Went to counseling and after what all was said I knew I could pursue any relationship I’d like and of course I’d like it to be sexual. But I can’t.

"OP, I’m sorry you picked a gross yuck, and genuinely sorry for the emotional and spiritual aftermath. And I’m equally sorry you’re suffering through being really horny. I’m divorced and refuse casual sex for the exact reasons you’re talking about. But it doesn’t make being horny any easier.

Longer periods of sexual sobriety help, though, as does having a community to help bear the burden. I attend a group for men with addiction issues toward sex and pornography. A lot of us who’ve ruined relationships and families over affairs or porn.

You wouldn’t want a guy like that, we don’t want to be that kinda guy. And you don’t want to be where you are either.

He may be one shot in that he doesn’t have enough stamina or libido to go again. But that doesn’t stop him from helping you finish off. Fucking selfish asshole. reading what he said to you makes me angry!


I empathize with you though. All I have are flings, it’s starting to make me feel awful about myself because I’ve heard many guys can have sex with just about anything that has a warm hole-whether they think someone is attractive or not. Then guys get sexually addicted to me because I’m “good at sex” but then half of those guys don’t even go down on me. They expect me to but don’t get their face anywhere near my prize.

"I’d say try finding a fwb. When I took a few years to be single and explore my sexuality in my mid 20s (I was a chronic serial monogamist in hs and college) I ended up mostly doing short term dating where I could hang out with someone and generally get on pretty well and there was genuine chemistry, just not women I could see myself actually being in a relationship with. So literally a new friend that I could have sex with then let go down the river of life after some time. 

I’d go out with them for a few months, make it clear what I was looking for from the start so as to not lead them on, and then when things started to fizzle out, it started feeling less casual for one of us, or they started being not so cool, I’d break it off and start looking again. Sometimes we’d go on dates, more often we’d just go to one of our places and have sex and watch a movie or eat dinner or something. Low key but consistent.

The benefit is that I had someone I liked and could generally trust, we would have a few times to learn some of each others likes and dislikes in bed, sometimes experience some things I hadn’t before, and when we were done with sex I didn’t feel gross or guilty because I liked them as a person. Having personal chemistry also made for much better sex because it usually meant a little more passion.

It was tiring but I think made for better overall experiences than my one night stands. Hope this helps!"	Strict-Bug4079	reply	na	na	na	0.9994974136352539	no	strong	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.

First time I was kissed it was a dare. First time I was pursued sexually it was by a man in his thirties I was 15 but I was scared so he didn’t enter me. The first time i had actually sex I was gang r8ped by eight strangers. When I went to the hospital they told me not to consider it my first time bc it wasn’t on my terms. Next time I had sex it was with my crush and was painful and awkward. I spent the majority of my life thinking sex was fucking and getting a guy off. Then I recently was made love to by my first love (met when we were 13) and it opened my perception of what intimacy is.  Casanova ghosted me but I consider him to be my first. All the others were just practice. My point is don’t get hung up on firsts. I actually popped my cherry riding a horse so my rapists didn’t believe I was a virgin when they were confronted by my friend. He told you that “you were awful” because he was embarrassed he ejaculated too soon and didn’t want to admit that you turned him on so much he couldn’t contain himself! Fr! Boys used to spit on me on the school bus then flirt with me in private. Don’t be surprised if he hits you up for a booty call and don’t give in. He doesn’t deserve you.

"I had an ex who was my first and used to ask me what I wanted. I would tell him that I had no idea, but was willing to find out. He didn't get it and I used to feel like it was all me that was terrible. I guess I was a little, but that's ok cause I was still learning about myself. What I did realize later was that he was actually terrible himself! I think he learned from Porn, and thought he was god's gift to women.

I really found myself with a gorgeous man with a sexy British accent who was a bit of a gymnast! (Well in bed at least...). And an FWB that I felt safe with, could try new things, and just let it all out ;)

"So sorry to hear that. That is an absolute shitty guy! Fuck him! You did nothing wrong, you are valued and appreciated! He is an idiot!! 

I've been with some virgins myself through the years, and have always prioritised clear and open communication and her experience when such times have happened. The first time whether there is a female or males first time, is supposed to be a time where both feel safe, seen and respected. Anyone who doesn't give that is an absolute shithead!!

Unfortunately there are a lot of people who only think about their own experience in bed, and unfortunately a majority of the idiots are men. You were unlucky that this occurred with one of those absolute idiots.  But you shouldn't give him the power to make you feel bad, he is the one who is at fault and should feel like shit.

"Well, physical intimacy ebbs and flows when you're in a long-term relationship. Things like new jobs, changing lifestyles, children, money, etc. all affect it. Not to mention that people's libidos change ALL THE TIME, with pregnancy/kids, diet, menstrual cycles, sleep, stress etc.

All this to say that his wife does not owe him sex. I say this as a borderline ace woman who has a lot of sexual trauma and still feels an extremely deep connection and closeness with my partner. We do not know her story--or his, for that matter--so to say that it's ""sad"" assumes what their experience is like as a couple. Maybe he was making a joke - maybe he wasn't, but it actually doesn't bother him that much - maybe it does bother him but he's okay with looking past it because he loves his partner and loves supporting her - maybe it's a dealbreaker for him that he needs physical intimacy and it's a dealbreaker for her that she feels overwhelmed by too much physical intimacy - etc. We just don't know. 

Also, he said a lot of other important things. Like that he said she was a ""beautiful and wonderful woman"" and that she has a ""deep personal connection"" with him. So, we know that he loves her and she loves him. While you got sad for him that he wasn't having sex, I was applauding the first sentence he wrote: ""*One shot kinda guy* is pretty hard to say coherently without a tongue and fingers."" YES. Yes, yes, yes!!! THAT is the sentence we should be concentrating on. Also his observations that he needs a personal connection with the person in order to enjoy sex. YES! Also important. I really appreciated everything he had to say.

I guess this is my curiosity: he said so many great things, why was the only thing you had to say ""It kills me & I'm sorry that you're not having sex""?

Basically they are unloading any bad energy/emotion they are clinging to into you and you to them. People use sex in the wrong ways and give that energy to others too freely and too casually.

Alright, so basically everyone carries baggage and energy with them, the good, the bad, the ugly, and if they don’t take the time to cleanse themselves regularly (via a literal spiritual bath or some other ritual), the nasty shit tends to accumulate over time. So when they decide to sleep with someone, they leave some of that nasty baggage in that person’s energy field and take some of that person’s good energy and luck with them whether they are aware of it or not. That’s why after sleeping with certain people you may feel like shit on an emotional/spiritual level, or notice that things in your life starts going wrong while things start looking good for that dirty mf you allowed in your bed.

The person I lost my virginity to who I’d been in a relationship with told me I was bad at sex. It messed me up. We only had sex a handful of times before we broke up because it felt like no matter what I did it wasn’t enough. I never enjoyed it and thought maybe I just wasn’t a sexual person. My friends tried to tell me to no avail that he was probably the one that was bad at sex. Met my current partner soon after and sex with was awesome and mutually enjoyable from the get go.

"My bf and I have no sex life and it IS sad. Sexual incompatibility is legitimate and DOES ruin relationships. While no one has to do anything they don't want to, neither does the person who has a higher libido. You are allowed to draw the line in the sand and leave a partner who isn't into sex. Most of the time, this incompatibility absolutely decimates a relationship. 

In this particular case, he seems content without sex. And that's okay. It's also okay for him to feel frustration around the lack of sex, because again, it sucks for those of us with libidos. Sex. Is. Important. To those who are not ace, of course. 

It sucks to be with someone and not be able to have sex is what I'm trying to say. Sure you can appreciate your partner for every other thing they have to offer, but unless you're ace, you will certainly feel the strains of the lack of sexual intimacy, I assure you. And it will sting and it will hurt and it will fuckin suck. People are allowed to voice frustration over it and people are allowed to validate someone struggling without that immediately disregarding all the nice stuff someone has said about their partner. 

You're just... reading too deep, man. Taking it too personal, not ""woke"". I'm sure it stings to see someone express frustrations about not having sex with their partner, being ace yourself.

I met him at work and my connection to him was instant. I was super strict about not dating coworkers. After a couple months working together I knew I was gonna have some type of relationship with him. We initially just started as FWB but after 3/4 months I had feelings. I distanced myself from him since I could feel our connection was strong and that's not what he was looking for at the time. I hadn't felt anything for anyone in a while and knew he was it. He on the other hand had always been in relationships and wanted to try being single. We stopped talking and just went back to being coworkers. We even tried seeing other people. Almost a year went by and we ended up having dinner again. At dinner I told him my heart couldn't handle him in my life as just a friend. He proposed in May on the beach with my best friend and parents there. I really thought I would spend my life alone, I was already 36 when I met him.

"???

I guess I'm confused because I never said it was invalid to feel that way about sex. I'm a borderline ace woman with a long-term partner who really thrives off of physical intimacy and sex. I love him, and he loves me. We have talked a LOT about it and I agree with everything that you said. I want to be clear that I don't disagree with you, but rather, the OP was put in a really tough situation because of her inner conflicts and because of the shitty guy she slept with. Then No\_Bicycle6657 said SO MANY THINGS in his comment that are SO IMPORTANT related to OP's post! I was just frustrated that we glossed over the things that he said that were sooooo important and jumped straight to ""no sex in a relationship is sad."" OP was taken advantage of! Not cared for! Her  (I'm assuming OP is a woman, though I may be wrong and this argument applies no matter the gender) need for sex was not valued or respected by her sexual partner! THAT sucks. And also supports what you are saying where physical intimacy is really important to some people. 

So why aren't we talking about it? Why did we skip straight to ""no sex equals sadness""? Because that is not true for everybody. It's generalizing and assumes No\_Bicycle's experience. We can acknowledge that for some people no sex is sad and for some people no sex is safe. Also, some people aren't ace and sex isn't important to them, and some people are ace and sex is important to them. You're saying I'm reading too deep--what I am saying is that we need to not project our own experiences onto someone else and pay attention to the actual point they were trying to make.

Maybe I projected a bit too, and I can acknowledge that, but I stand by my point. And maybe I'm looking deeper, but maybe that's not a bad thing? Also, like...you got deep too, man. This is all deep. OP's post is so complex. We could talk about sexism, language around sex, what healthy sex and unhealthy sex looks like, how our society views sex, sex as an emotional need and sex as a weapon...the list goes on. Even the comment I originally criticized is deep and layered with ideas about sexual values and needs. This whole comment thread is deep! I had only respect for what you were saying until you told me I was ""reading too deep."" It almost felt like you were gaslighting me. Maybe think twice before writing a long and passionate comment about something before telling someone that they are ""reading too deep"" into something.

I want you to know that I do respect what you had to say and I do understand that sex is important to some people. I also agree that what you said is important to acknowledge in the larger conversation about sexual and relational health."

i think that’s just a shitty man problem. women don’t orgasm during sex because the average man thinks this way, one night stand or not. that’s just how normalized it is for a man to cum and be out the door before even considering if the person underneath him felt good or even orgasm in the first place. because i can guarantee you that the one night stand you’d have sex with would make sure you came, right? yet not even that could be reciprocated and that’s less than the bare minimum. yuck. 🫶	Strict-Bug4079	reply	na	na	na	0.9994974136352539	no	strong	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.

"hi, this is my first post ever but i needed to tell someone about this. basically about a week ago, while i was at work, a regular customer came in, i talked to him for a few minutes and flirted a bit, as usual. eventually he came back up to me and told me i was very pretty. i thanked him and he left.

2 days later and he was back and this time asked for my number and i gave it to him. (i think at this point it’s maybe important to mention i am a legal adult but barley and he looked to be very early 30s but later learned he was in his 40s). i was very definitely into him, especially since i had been looking to hook up with an older guy.

we texted back and forth and i quickly realized he was a very horny person, saying he was jerking off thinking about me, telling me about kinks and fetishes, etc. i didn’t mind at all as i was looking to hook up even though i did joke around with my friend about it a bit. 

anyways, eventually we were exchanging nudes back and forth and had plans of meeting up. then i decided to google him. i didn’t know he last name but i’m from a smallish town and i found him quickly. i soon realized he has kids which i thought was kinda weird so i did some more digging and fairly quickly found a girl with the same last name, stating in her profile information that matched everything i had just figured out (amount of kids, place of work, etc.) 

i texted him and hour ago asking if he’s married and then sent screenshots of what i found but he hasn’t answered yet. i’m freaking tf out. i don’t know what to do and i feel horribly guilty and even though we didn’t really do anything physical what he was saying and sending is definitely cheating if he is actually married. i just wished i had looked him up first, i found everything so easily after the fact and have obviously learned my less about researching people your seeing but holy fuck i still feel like a shit person."	user715482721	post	24.259468099002866	female	White	0.998172402381897	na	na	na	4	offmychest	no prediction.

"     My dad died today. I was rubbing his shoulder as he collapsed while my mom one the phone with 911. He couldn’t breathe right for the past few days and his doctors said that was “normal” and he was “fine”. They said it was the result of the new medications he was on. They claimed there was no need for him to come in to the hospital unless he got worse and they would see him at his appointment next week. Well he evidently got worse and didn’t tell us that he was. 
      I did cpr for 20 mins with my mom until help arrived. I sent my mom downstairs to get her shoes so she would be out of the way and in a safer location when the news came. I wanted her to be with my Mémère and have the support she needed while I was there to tell the paramedics what I knew. I knew deep down that he was gone, as I watched the firefighters and eventually the paramedics work on him. 
     I am supposed to go back to college for my senior year next week. He was supposed to help me move in and set up my computer for me. Come to my senior game and watch me graduate. And now he can’t. 
     I can tell I am in shock. I feel so disconnected from everything. I can’t even begin to imagine what my mom is feeling. She just lost her life partner. I know I lost my dad, but she lost him just before their anniversary. It’s this Friday they would have been married for 39 years. 
     This is so surreal. I just want to get my thoughts out. I don’t expect anything to come from this really, it’s just a shout to the void of the internet.

"I recently just moved into my college dorm. I have always had trouble sleeping and feeling restless. Normally, I always feel restless and it is never easy for me to relax. But, after moving into the dorm and getting away from childhood house, I've never felt better. I thought I would feel homesick or at least lonely. But, I don't. I am in a better spot, if I'm being honest.

 I realized my friend was right, all I needed was to get out of my house. I feel free for the first time in forever. I feel like my life is actually mine.  I'm used to having pretend to be someone else for other people, just to fit their expectations or spare their feelings. For the first time, I don't have to. I can be myself and stop pretending. 

I never realized how heavy that house or my hometown felt until I left. No matter what I did back home, I always felt trapped and that I needed to get away as fast as possible. Now that I (mostly) have,  I feel better. I don't want to go back home, though I know I have to. I can at least get away for a while. Until, I can get my own place, which is something I plan to do before the next school year (hopefully). 

I feel guilty at the same time though. I'm the oldest in my family. I still have a little brother at home. My dad has been more distant and he is now recently starting talking to us more. He has spent a lot of time with his girlfriend these past few months. We have both been pushed aside, but my brother has been pushed aside even more. I'm worried for him.

I'm trying to not let my worry eat me alive. This is the first time I've been away from home. I needed this. I've been needing to get out of my house and away from my family. I'm trying to enjoy this, at least till I can move out 100%.  "	ghosttubbs	post	20.155999580078532	female	White	0.0011660730233415961	na	na	na	0	offmychest	failed

I want to date and have a boyfriend but the fact that my breasts are so unattractive makes it impossible for me. There have been guys I really liked who have tried to date me but I ended up turning them down because I know they would be disappointed and turned off by them if they saw them. It just hurts to see all my friends getting boyfriends and confidently having sex knowing I can’t do the same. I’m pretty sure I will die a virgin because of this since I cannot afford surgery. I’ve felt this way for years about my breasts since I hit puberty, I am 19 now. I wish I was asexual/aromantic so i would be okay with being single forever.

By the sound of it, it’s you that finds them unattractive and not the guys you’ve turned down. Large boobs are hard to hide, so chances are these guys were well aware you had a large chest and they were probably into it.

All boobs are awesome but I tend to be more attracted to bigger ones, more to love on during intimacy! 

Would it make you uncomfortable if a man was paying extra attention to your chest or would it make you feel assured that you have nothing to be ashamed of? 

The right partner will make you feel so good about yourself especially during sex and you should allow yourself to experience what it feels like to be with someone who loves all the things about you that you may not love yourself.

I'm in my twenties, and I recently graduated from paramedic school and am currently working for an EMS service. Ever since I achieved my big goal of graduating and working, I realized how much I hate it and how much motivation/inspiration I lost. Don't get me wrong, I like the medical and patient care aspect of the job. But I hate the thought of the get-up, work, eat, sleep, rinse and repeat for the rest of my life. Every time, I have a shift or when work calls, I dread having to go in or answer my phone. I'm a quiet person, I hate interacting and meeting new co-workers. It stresses me out and makes me extremely uncomfortable that I have to force myself to get to know people. I wish I could go back to when I started paramedic school or when I started my ride outs.

"Hi,

I’m sorry, I don’t know where else to turn. I saw someone had posted something similar in this forum. My ex husband committed suicide today. I have sole custody of our 2 young kids. He battled schizophrenia for several years and we split up as his mental illness was making him abusive and unstable. I had to get a protection order against him. However, he’s still the father of my children and someone whom I loved and I feel so confused and lost. I’m waiting to make an appointment with my therapist but I don’t know how to process this or what to do. I’m in shock and can’t stop shaking.

I had a bit of trouble at work today. I returned after a month-long vacation, and my coworker shared some work gossip and drama about my other two coworkers, Fred and Sam, who are close friends at work and whom I am also acquainted with. He informed me that they had a disagreement and weren't speaking for a few days. I asked how they resolved it, to which he replied that he wasn't sure, but they were fine after two days. Later, I approached them and we chatted. I inquired with Sam about how they patched things up, and she asked who had told me. I replied that I heard it from a little birdie, but she reminded me that I hadn't been present due to my absence from the country. She mentioned that only two others were aware of the situation, so she knew one of them had spoken. I changed the topic then. Eventually, the coworker who shared the details with me admitted that Sam knew he had told me, and she was upset. He mentioned that Fred said it was a breach of privacy. I apologized profusely, and he accepted it. Fred and I were once close, but our dynamic has changed, though we still hold mutual respect and care for each other. Later, I sensed Fred's anger and asked if he was okay; he replied he was contemplating how not to be furious. I'm uncertain about what to do. I'm sensitive and cried after leaving work. Drama involving Fred and me occurred before my vacation, and I had hoped for a fresh start upon returning. He acted like he liked me but never made a move, yet he flirted and treated me differently. He began distancing himself due to someone's advice, and I almost cut ties. Now that I'm back, things seemed fine initially, but today they've reverted. I find it painful and often dwell on it."

"Where to even start. Before I go into it I just want to mention that I am seeking the relevant support for some of the trickier situations.  I’m sorry this is such a self-indulgent rant- I know these things can sound like seeking pity but I am fully aware of my accountability and I’m owning it. I’m just exhausted

I’m honestly in shock at where my life is at the moment. Looking back a few years I couldn’t have even imagined it all. I’ve gone from being a career driven person, moving in the right direction in life. However there had been quite a few serious issues from a some quite traumatic past. I thought I had worked through or at least buried them enough for them to be an issue. Over the last few years things have been bubbling up more and more and I started to get really overwhelmed. The more I felt the more isolated and awful I felt. My confidence was running dry, I had no self esteem to muster. I’d started to medicate more and more with alcohol. This then turned into alcohol and cocaine. Going out alone, getting myself in dangerous situations, getting injured, the full works. Through self medicating I had slipped so far I found myself in the midst of quite aggressive addiction. Id startled to lie to and manipulate the people I loved to further my need to use. What ever ounce of self worth I had before addiction completely left-the person I was completely left. I would never have thought I would be someone who would do those things- they are so far removed from my values that looking at the person addiction made me become is disgusting to me.

So here I am now, in early recovery to try and get better. I had to leave my job in March to work on things and now I’m struggling to find employment again, I’m in so much debt from when I was in active addiction. Although I’m actively being productive for resolve my mental health gone to shit, there have been some truly scary moments and some very scary thoughts that I’m so embarrassed and shocked at. I’m being assessed for adhd and I’m being assessed for some mental health things whilst trying to work through some quite traumatic things from my past. I have no idea who I am. Everything I was as a person that gave me any kind of grounding or identity has dissolved other than all the dark stuff my brain has conveniently held on to for me to fill a body with.

I can’t believe how I’ve gone from a successful, bright bubbly person to being involved in treatment, struggling to find employment,and feeling so overwhelmed by all the things I was running away from. I feel like I’m starting again as an entirely different person. I know it’s for the better but for now it feels like a lot of quite big things all at once and my brain is fried. I just feel so embarrassed and ashamed that there are so many defects in me and my life. I’m heartbroken with the person I have become

"Hey, internet stranger. You are so strong. Being able to admit that you have an addiction, that you are taking steps to get better and improve your life - that’s amazing. So many people never manage to get to where you are. You are incredible and I mean that sincerely. I’ve known a lot of addicts and so many will just stay in denial rather than try to start over. What you’re doing takes courage and strength. 

If I might make a suggestion, though - please lean on the people around you. If you have friends or family, reach out to them. I know you might feel shame about your addiction or debt, but don’t hide the scarier parts of your life. People who care about you want to know what’s going on so they can support you fully. Talk to them, lean on them. If you don’t have people you trust, then find a support group either in person or online. Build up a foundation of people that want to see you succeed.

And lastly, you said that you feel heartbroken over you are right now. But in the future, you’re going to love yourself again. You may never be that bubbly and bright person, but you will come out of this wiser and more experienced. You might even be able to help others who have gone through similar traumas.

"TW: SA, Drug abuse, mentions of thoughts of suicide
  

  
We met at one of the worst times of my life and I will admit even after we’d been dating I did things I shouldn’t have. We met on FB dating and fell for each other fast and hard, we both fell in love and both said we could never imagine a life without the other, and that no matter what happened we would always stick together and be each other’s forever. I told her I couldn’t believe that she would stay after all the trauma I’d been through, losing my dad at 12, being molested/raped before 10 by a step brother, suicidal and drinking/drugs by 13 that went on for years and years. But her response was “I’ll prove it to you every day, and I’ll never stop loving you and being by your side. I am yours until the day you die, and I won’t let anything destroy this.” And to her credit, she stuck around longer than I ever expected her to. I let myself trust and believe her. 
  
After a while of being together, I let my son move with his mom out of state to grow up with his new little half brother, and my family hated me for it.
  
They told me I was ruining his and everyone in my family’s lives, that I was a piece of shit, and that I was worthless. Everything bad you could imagine.
  
They couldn’t comprehend I did it because the schools were better, the doctors were better and with his pacemaker that was important, and he ended up loving his little brother more than the world. He misses living here and still asks when he can move back, and I wish he could today. I wish he was with me every single second, but it just wasn’t working.
  
A lot of that was because I had developed a heroin addiction because of all the mental issues, past trauma, and physical pain from a car accident when I was 18. (I’m 33 now, 31 or 32 at the time)
  
Since my family hated me, I moved in with my love and her sister and brother in law, and honestly even though I was a heroin addict I was happier than I’d ever been in my life. They were all the family and friends I’d never had and always wanted, we did everything together. One night i was laying in bed and started bawling from guilt, and woke my love up and told her I had been using and was addicted to heroin. The next morning she left for work, and told her sister and brother in law. I knew it was all over. I knew they’d tell me to get the fuck out and never come back. I messaged them and told them I’d leave immedietly if needed, whatever they wanted and I was so sorry for everything, including bringing it in their house and around their young kids. 
  
Her brother in laws response was “don’t ever fucking bring it around our kids or house again, and shut the fuck up about leaving. You’re family and we love you, you aren’t going anywhere.”
  
I have never felt more love for people than these 3 . They offered to help me in any way possible and that we’d get through it together, and I knew these were the people I would always need in my life.  Nothing would ever change that.
  

  
and even though I always said I’d never get married after seeing my mom and stepdads marriage implode and her and my dad never even being together while I was alive I knew I couldn’t live without her and after about a year, we secretly got married. We did it in our living room, our brother in law got licensed online and we were married and I had never been happier. We decided to tell everyone we were engaged, and had a wedding a while later in utah.
  
A little while after that my in laws had their poly partners move in, and me and my wife decided to move out. We didn’t want to, but their happiness was important to us so we moved back in with my family. I relapsed on and off and eventually it got so toxic we had to move but didn’t know where.
  
We decided to move to utah with her best friend, and I ended up buying the last of my heroin the day before we left and that was that.
  
She ended up finding it a day or two after we arrived there. She took it and when I woke up in the night and realized, I yelled at her to give it back because I needed it. I’ve regretted that moment ever since, but in my addiction it happened. We ended up not being able to stay where we were, and her best friend found a friend we could stay with. So we packed and moved again. The first night or second night there her best friend freaked out and told my wife she had to choose, “your worthless heroin addict husband or me” “we could have the best life together if he wasn’t holding you back and ruining your life” 
  
She chose me and cut her best friend off. 
  
I had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar along with extreme ptsd from my past trauma. I started medication before we moved to utah, and the longer I was on it the more I lost my memory and became a different person. Between that, going through withdrawals and being clean for 2 or 3 months and the extreme amount of stress and mental shit id gone through moving and being disowned by my entire family, I broke. I don’t remember almost any of the time we lived in utah. I came to visit my son for Christmas, and while I was out of town she hung out with her guy friend who had helped us move and ended up staying the night at his house. She told me and asked if I was okay with it, I apparently said I was because I trusted her completely and she swore nothing happened.
  

  
Apparently, she woke up one night to me groping her boobs while she was asleep and when she woke up I pretended to be asleep. She “had a trauma response/reaction” and even though I asked repeatedly for weeks if anything was wrong she said no and I believed it.
  
A few weeks later she told me one night, “we need to talk tomorrow”
  
“That sounds bad lol”
  
“It is”
  
The next day she told me what happened and that she wasn’t comfortable around me anymore and would never be with me again, so she wants a divorce and nothing will fix it. I moved out and came back to vegas the next day.
  

  
She decided she didn’t want to be friends anymore. One night her discord said drawing and talking trauma. I couldn’t help it and watched. 
  
She said I was “a worthless motherfucker who never contributed anything our entire relationship and did nothing but drag her down” among other things. I also found out a week later she was “in love” with that friend she’d stayed with and called him “the love of her life”
  

  
I did things wrong, I admit. But I never cheated or abused her, had multiple jobs while we were together, always put her first and always treated her and made sure she knew she was always the best part of my entire life. 
  
We always said we’d talk things out and work on anything wrong together.
  
I fucked up, but I also did everything possible for us to be together, including quitting heroin. 
  
And she threw me away like I was nothing. And now I know it was for this other guy. The thing she promised she’d never do. Her sister and bil told her she should fix things before she kicked me out. She just didn’t want to. 
  

  
And now I’m alone, putting my life back together. Without my best friend, my “forever”. I’ve never been so broken. And she doesn’t care in any way. 
  
I quit the meds, came back to who I was before, but it’s too late. And I don’t know what to do, or how to heal.

"Oh and I feel I should clarify something.

She’s been telling people in her stream and who knows where else I “sexually assaulted her”
For groping her boobs while she was asleep


There had been 4 or 5 times in the past I had woken up to her touching me while I was asleep and all of the times she did when I woke up we ended up having sex. I had never and have t ever since done anything like thhat before that night, but I do believe it happened. I was so mentally messed up that I barely remember any of our time there, even the talk about divorce is fuzzy and all I remember is her saying “I’ll love you until the day you die” but I feel that it was something that A. She had done before multiple times to me so in my insane medication addled mind I can see maybe doing something like that and stopping when she woke up because she’d done it to me before and we hadn’t had sex the entire 3 months or whatever we had been in the state and B. I think we could have just talked it out and she could have said don’t do that ever again and I wouldn’t have. 
It all comes down to me believing now she wanted to be with her “best friend” and didn’t want to be the “bad guy” so she broke up with and divorced me over this so I was the bad guy and she could move on “guilt free”

Me (f21) and  E(f21) have been friends for a while, but never close. After my breakup, she started inviting me over to party with her and her friends. I fell for her friend B but she didn’t want anything serious. One night it was just me and E hanging out. We drank and smoke and one thing led to another and we ending up sleeping together. E and her boyfriend C weren’t technically in a relationship so I excused my own actions even when they were bad. E later confessed she didn’t think about it as anything as casual, and she feels bad and her heart belongs to C. However, she later confessed she doesn’t like him and will not stay loyal to him. They started dating, and he explained how he regrets having sex with her, because he values it so much. It gets worse, we were at the club and she tried to kiss another guy, i told her there’s no excuses and that’s cheating, E said “I don’t love him, I like him but will not stay loyal to him.” I was blacked out, but that night, me E and B had a threesome. She won’t tell him, and since she considers us her close friends she doesn’t think she did anything wrong. Close friends don’t sleep together. And even if I tell, I’ll lose B as a friend, C would get spared, but E will not care, she’ll just find another guy to date and cheat on. And she has talked about guys she has been cheated on and how much she hates cheating. Is she not the same? I have never had a bad feeling in my stomach but now I do. But I feel if I reveal everything, only C ends up with the bad end of the stick. I feel horrible.

I suffer from pandemic-induced agoraphobia and D.I.D. I will be flying first class to visit a life-long friend that's been suffering from an undiagnosed brain condition that's been effecting his speech and memory to act as a patient advocate for him (At his request.) to receive the medical care he needs. I'm posting about this here because I've never in my life flown first class, and I'm worried that my mental health issues might cause a nervous breakdown during the flights. Do you all have any tips or suggestions for ways to make the trip less stressful for me? 	PaganMa	post	40.08571300730233	male	White	0.9911831617355347	na	na	na	3	offmychest	no prediction.
"Is this your first time flying, or just your first time in first class? If you are just worried about being in first class, then you have nothing to worry about. First class is just like the others, but with more leg room and somewhat comfier seats.

I don't understand enough about DID or agoraphobia to really be helpful with those. I don't know if it helps, but most people on a plane want as little to do with everyone else on the plane as possible. They're not going to be paying attention to you; on the contrary, they're going to be doing as much as possible to distract their attention away from everyone else on the plane. Which, from the sounds of it, may also be a good idea for you. You could try listening to soothing music (with headphones/earbuds, of course), sleeping, or maybe binging a comfort show.

I'd imagine the biggest worry for someone who's never been in first class is feeling out of place or feeling like you don't belong. A sort of imposter syndrome. Don't worry about that.

Most of the people who people who overdress for a plane flight - especially in first class - are people who are worried about feeling out of place. Truth is, even if you're the worst dressed person on the plane, you're still going to be way better than a lot of the passengers the attendants have seen.

Truth is, as long as you behave okay, you'll be okay. While I know that agoraphobia and DID aren't things that you can simply will out if existence, you can at least rest assured that people will not be paying attention to you. I hope that can at least assuage some of your concerns :)"	PaganMa	reply	na	na	na	0.9911831617355347	no	no	strong	na	offmychest	no prediction.

There was a girl I worked with that I connected with pretty well, I ended up crushing pretty heavily on her, spent time with her outside of work really got along, eventually I found out she had a boyfriend who lived 3 hours away I decided to pull back because I didn't want to ruin a relationship in anyway. I still talked to her but didn't push any further eventually I discovered she had cheated with another coworker that was also into her, and he had been gloating about it at work. I told her he was gloating about it (she didn't work that night) and after awhile I wanted to be supportive since she seemed regretful and was trying to make up for her mistakes, and I asked friends advice on what to do etc, ofc talking about something like this spreads because she found out I told more people and was mad at me, despite the guy she cheated with was the reason even knew at all and she still hung out with him and such.

I (18F) met this boy A (19M) through a mutual friend G (19F). With A we shared some classes, so over time we became friends. We have been friends for about 6 months, we talked often and everything seemed normal, but today A texted me that he had a crush on me. The problem is that I only see him as a friend :(
I don't want to hurt him and I also don't want to lose my friendship with G.

Also, there's the fact that A is a guy who shares absolutely all of his friends with, so maybe my rejection will spread like wildfire and make some of my peers look down on me 💔

"Title. I (NB) like to think of myself as asexual to some degree, as well-- I hate the actual act of sex, touching genitals, any of that, I absolutely hate it. But something about violence really does something for me in a way that I can't explain.   
My asexual partner (NB too) has expressed liking violence in art and media in a similar fashion to me (like yandere stuff, violent art, etc) but I don't think they ""like"" it to the degree that I do. I mean, I have had fantasies of getting beat up before, I've always found violence hot. I think it's strangely intimate and I like watching it in media but I HATE actual IRL acts of it. I only want it to happen to cartoon characters and me. No one and nothing else. Let me make that very clear. I am not a sadist, and I don't know if I'm a sexual masochist either-- I don't care for the sex part, even if the idea of getting hurt does excite me in a non-normal, aroused way.   


I feel like an alien sometimes. I don't know if I should tell them or if there's even a point to telling them. They are sex repulsed and so am I, there's no point to saying it, but I just needed to tell someone about this weird thing I have. Maybe its a self-hatred or low self-worth thing, I don't know, but I like to draw fearplay/bloodplay/knifeplay/impactplay/whatever stuff  and consume art of it all the time. I find myself replaying fictional violence scenes because they're hot to me.

"Hi all, I (21f) am currently going through it. Today started with me opening up and refreshing my college email as classes start in about a week. With the refresh came an email stating i’ve been put on academic probation for falling below a 2.0 GPA and need a supporting class in order to continue with the upcoming semester. I am absolutely crushed. I was enrolled in a class this summer where I failed by simply not turning in all the assignments required. I chalk this up to:
 1. pure burnout/laziness - because I had already finished one summer class which took 7 weeks and had a 3 day “summer break” and prioritized other things.
2. I started working 2 jobs and found the balance hard to work with (seeing that I finished my previous summer class with a C)
3. my stressful relationship which has caused me major emotional turmoil the whole summer. 

Needless to say, I’ve been lying to my parents saying although the class was hard, I pushed through and finished. Now my consequence is being out on academic probation and facing the possibility of being suspended for a semester. We are very close with each other and they pay half of what it takes for me to college, and I am racked with guilt. I feel real shitty.

Bonus: I was already having thoughts of breaking up with my boyfriend today and preparing myself for the conversation later tonight.

I reluctantly gave them my house keys so they would feel more comfortable. The only condition I gave was that they had to leave the doors open to my house. They didn’t do so. I really needed to get into my house for this prior event. I tried talking to them about it after they told me they locked my doors….they hung up on me. Instead of letting my temper get the best of me I figured a way to get into my house. After that I continued on my stressful day and bareky looked at my phone.

"it be your own fucking family, man. it be your own fucking family. don’t act like you ever fucking loved me. you abused my mother for being pregnant with me. you told her i was going to be an ugly fucking human being because i would inherit my dad’s big nose, big head, and crooked teeth. 

there was no love for me in the womb, so why would there be love for me when i was born? why would there be love for me now? or back then? or ever? you are a fucking selfish prick i fucking hate you so much. i blow out my birthday candles every year wishing you would finally just fucking die. i would spit on your grave and whisper the most vile, hateful shit into the ground you’re six feet under. 

why? because you raised me, not my mother. it was you. you raised me to be a hateful soul. you turned me into this fucking monster. YOU gave me Borderline Personality Disorder. you ruined my fucking life and you always fucking have. 

“and you know who gave you everything from day one.” and that justifies all the fucking abuse you put me through my whole life? that justifies all the endless torment you inflicted on an innocent little girl? you think spoiling me rotten and smothering me in money and gifts is going to mend the wounds and scars you inflicted on me since the day i was born? 

no fucking wonder i would lash out on people for buying me something as little as a monster energy drink. no wonder i hesitate to ask people for ANYTHING. no wonder i feel so fucking horrible any time i ask anyone for ANYTHING. because any time i did with YOU, you would use it against me. you dangle all these treasures and materials you’ve drowned me in and expect me to fucking take your abuse like a fucking obedient pup. 

when people die, usually the first thing they hear is their loved one’s voice. i don’t even fucking REMEMBER what your voice sounds like. i have your screams and your insults and your mockeries memorized more than anything else. 

ever since i was a little girl, i felt so fucking wrong liking the color pink. i felt so fucking wrong being a natural blonde and having blue eyes. why? because you dye your hair my natural color. you put fake blue eye contacts in your eyes. you are obsessed with pink. everything i was, i had to erase of myself and become an empty shell of fucking nothing just to reassure my little girl self that i was nothing like you. i NEVER wanted to be like you. you always called me your “little me” all my childhood and i fucking despised it. it made me want to vomit, so i dyed my hair black and swallowed down the inevitable urge to gouge my eyes out. i pretended to hate the color pink and dress in all black to look in the mirror and see celeste, not lily. 

but i never see celeste. i never saw celeste. i don’t know who celeste fucking is. and it’s because of YOU. YOU YOU YOU, it’s always been YOU. and aren’t you supposed to like that, you narcissistic asshole? being the center of attention? why is it when it’s something negative that you shy away and gaslight? you want to be perfect and drilled it into my brain that i must be perfect, or else i am nothing and undeserving of love. i remember the way my breath would tremble whenever you would ask me what grade i got in school. i remember the way my hands shook when i would come home with a new piercing or tattoo that made me feel happy, knowing you would scream disapproval.

i am ugly with “thumbtacks” in my face, my ink is too big and ugly, my black hair looks unnatural and ugly, i look like a man with shaved eyebrows, me liking girls is just a phase, sex is important in all relationships and you will never find a sexless romance, “your rape was the equivalent of me getting my ass slapped”, wearing all that black i must be going to a funeral, right? yes, i am preparing for yours. 

ALL MY FUCKING LIFE I HAVE BEEN PREPARING FOR YOURS. I WEAR BLACK BECAUSE I AM CONSTANTLY MOURNING THE LITTLE GIRL YOU DESTROYED. 

you tell me i used to be so bubbly, so kind, so outgoing—a social butterfly. what happened? IT’S YOU. YOU DID THIS TO ME. you blew the spark from my soul and now i feel nothing.

i am monotone, i rarely ever speak, i overthink before i say a word, i flinch easily, all my laughter is fake so i don’t “ruin the mood” like you always told me. i don’t remember the last time i genuinely laughed. or smiled. i don’t even know who i fucking AM anymore. i have NEVER KNOWN, because of YOU. 

and now because of you, i have to abandon my mother and sisters because the hospital wouldn’t let me go if i didn’t agree to move in with my dad. and that fucking kills me, because they are the only family i have.

i fantasize about you dying every day. i fantasize about killing myself and blaming you in my suicide note, because maybe then, my mother and sisters would finally be free from your torment.

i hate you."	manicmommy8	post	17.413123296432595	female	White	0.9988011121749878	na	na	na	2	offmychest	failed

"I 20M am planning to end my life, after the death of my senior dogs one 15 yrs old and the other 10 years old (One just died this February, she is 14 years, yes it fucked me up also), they are the only ones keeping me around, they are easy to get sick so I need to be still around them before me, as only I is the only one that is meticulous when taking care of them.  


I came from a very toxic household a physically (which stopped but only around when I was around 18-19 years old, and only to my mom) and emotionally abusive father, I don't know why she endured it but for us, yes they are still together (divorce and annulment is not really common in our country, religious people things), and a mom who is also very prideful not accepting any tips/help in things she is not doing right which makes me feel like useless. Seeing the physical abuse and experiencing the emotionally abuse (which is still happening to this day) through the years, I cannot handle it anymore, I want them to realize what they did wrong and they are still doing wrong. Yes, I have talked it about them but they just won't listen just because they think adults are always right and us who are their children should just listen to them, I even opened up my feelings they invalidate it but accept it, but then days go by they are doing it again, and to add the first time I opened to my mother that I am not happy living anymore you know what she did? she invalidated what I feel and cried while saying ""we gave everything to you bla bla bla"" which what she is talking about is their responsibility to us as a parent. (That's why I'm fucked at socializing) It made me a people pleaser, a friend who you can talk about what you are feeling even the suicidal thoughts (which also drained me, but I'm still there for them because they need one ;\]). These fucked up past is also the reason why my sister is having a hard time, she got pregnant while not financially ready, these emotions were cause by the toxic household, she wants to feel the love of a family which she was finding on others.  


I came upon this decision to hope that this time they will realize the mistakes they did and they are doing, so that when they realize it then my Sister will be the one benefitting from it and help her properly with her problems (as I believe they should because it's really their fault) I don't want my nephews to be in the same position as us.  


I just wish assisted suicide is available for those who cannot really feel living in this world anymore (I very much still highly support the attention to mental health), then there is no need to suffer for a long time anymore.   


P.S. Advice won't matter to me anymore, because I believe that even when I take meds there won't be any difference/s as it would still be the very same toxic household.

"You would rather have your sister and nephews suffer from loosing you by taking your own life, where they will be traumatized, then try to attempt to get out and away from your parents? 

You may think taking your life will make it easier for your sister, but it won’t. She will have to deal with knowing her brother died at 20 to suicide for the rest of her life. Potentially putting her in harm further from your parents, or causing her to feel that your death is your fault and she didn’t do enough for you. It could possibly lead to her neglecting her own children because she’s so distraught. Is that what you really want? If all fails and your parents did nothing, you took your own life thinking it would help others, when it did not.

Your nephews don’t have to grow up like you and your sister did, you can cut contact with your parents and get help, so you don’t fall into toxic behaviors. You can take steps to end the abuse now before it happens.

"You're finding ways to validate it my friend, what you're telling yourself it'll achieve is absolute nonsense of course but that's okay. I'm older than you, I have survived serious suicide attempts before perspective kicked in, your sister will not benefit and at 20 you have all the time in the world to change things as does she.

"I (22F) am an engineering student, I am on my last semester and it's been overwhelming for the past four months because right now I'm supposed to choose what I'm going to do for the rest of my life, but the things going on in the school are only making it worse for all of us.

I was halfway through my second semester when the pandemic started and we were forced to abandon the campus, I wasn't too worried about this because I had amazing teachers. 

The class I liked better was electricity because of the professor.

He was my favorite teacher, I liked him because he looked at us as humans and not like robots, he was a good person treating us as people. He was funny, smart and understanding. At that time, my grandpa had months to live so I was medicated to prevent me from wanting to throw myself off a building. Because of this, I would usually fall asleep on his ftf classes and he would say nothing because he knew the side effects of the pills I was on. He was not even strict with the online classes, he sent us to investigate, do activities and then he answered any questions individually, he said that it was not worth overloading us with work, because what we were going through was enough.
 
A few years later the pandemic ended, and we were allowed to return to the classroom. I would see him in the corridors and greet him genuinely happy, among me and my classmates there was the joke of calling him ""dad"" and that would make him smile every time.

A few months ago I ran into him in the school patio and greeted him, we sat down and talked for almost two hours. He told me a little about his struggles and I did the same, we kinda vented to each other for a while and after that my bus arrived and i said goodbye to him, he told me to ""keep going, because I was doing great"". I smiled at him and told him that I would invite him to my graduation protocol, he laughed and shook his head. 

In the last four years, at least five students at my university have committed suicide, and many others have tried (for reference, my school has barely 600 studens), mental health is a joke to the administration despite constant complaints and cries for help. Last week the one that killed himself was my teacher.

After I received the news I felt numb for a while, then our last conversation hit me like a train, he was really saying goodbye to me  because after our last encounter he quit his job, he used to say that he felt very unappreciated as a teacher but he ""had no other choice"". My school tutor said that a few days ago this teacher went to sign his resignation letter and he seemed very calm.

I can only imagine what was going through his head because of the things he said to me all those months ago, and it is possible that he already knew back then.

It’s possible he had already planned it all and was waiting for everything to be in place for when he left. I’ve heard a lot of people who choose to take their lives like to clean up everything around them so when they leave it’s makes it easier for the people picking up the pieces.

My bf (24m) and myself (21f) have been together for a year and half. I knew him around 3 years ago before I went to university and deeply fell for him then, we had sex and connected deeply but he has a very bad cocaine problem and we could never work because of it. We come from completely different backgrounds, he grew up with nothing, his mother was addicted to heroin and he has been through A LOT. i’ve had a good life, good parents and family around me and when I met him all I wanted was to help heal his trauma and show him how good life can be. I started university 3 years ago and we stopped talking as he told me it’s not going to work with how he is at the minute he cannot give me what I need but we stayed in contact as friends and occasionally had sex but nothing came of it even though I really wanted to, at the point I already felt so attached but he kept saying he never felt good enough for me. Fast forward a year and a half and he invited me to a rave he had spare tickets too and i didn’t know whether to go but decided to, and from that night he told me his deepest traumas and I just held him and was there for him, from that moment he fell completely in love with me and how I handled the situation made him realise we can be together and we aren’t so different. We had the BEST relationship, we knew everything about each other and I practically lived at his house, his bed was my bed, it was where I felt most safe and cosy and we couldn’t be away from each other. I was never into drugs before him and the first half of our relationship he was clean and stopped taking everything but one time I felt like I wanted to try it and he was open to the idea and we did and since then he’s fallen back into a place of doing it every weekend even when he has no money. We stopped going on dates, i stopped having flowers, I had to pay his rent & food and at this point I don’t even have a job i’m just in Uni but every time he took it I told him we could help him get back to the place he was and i never judged him whatsoever. He broke up with me 3 days ago because he said I am his safety blanket and he’s bringing my “pure angel self” down with him, he said he needed to sort his life out again in order to be a good boyfriend again. I was heartbroken and begged him to stay but realised he was gonna end up worse if he didn’t fix himself. Yesterday I got a message from someone telling me my bf hasn’t been honest and basically told me he cheated on me January time in a threesome at a hotel, i remember begging him to come home that night and the next day he was telling me he wanted die and he doesn’t deserve me i just thought it was the comedown and i told him everything would be okay. When i went to confront him I also found out he’s cheated multiple times while on cocaine, he’s had a girl in our bed 2 weeks ago (my final day of uni that i was meant to celebrate) and he used my sex toys on her, and there’s been multiple times with this girl where he’s cheated on me with her on coke. I was destroyed, I haven’t eaten properly from the breakup in 3 days, i was throwing up and couldn’t breathe and he was crying sobbing begging saying when he takes coke he is a different person that it isn’t him and he loves me with all his heart and that’s why he had to breakup with me because he wanted to get rid of this part of himself so he could prove he could be worthy of me again. I’m finding it hard to let go as I’m believing it isn’t him , i know he is a different person on coke, i’ve seen it, but i just can’t fathom how he would do this to me and he keeps saying it just wasn’t him and the boy i fell in love with is still here ready to change. I gave him everything, I loved him with every fibre of my being I don’t know how to get over this. He said he is going to prove to me he can get rid of this addiction and completely remove this other “side” of him every day and hopes when he does I will take him back. All I want is him, he’s the love of my life I am so lost now. Our relationship was perfect and part of me wishes I never found out and he just got better like he wanted to. He just keeps telling me his life is dedicated to getting rid of this evil selfish side to be with me again one day.	milkymoo111	post	24.78644902285404	female	White	0.005589833948761225	na	na	na	21	offmychest	no prediction.
">and when I met him all I wanted was to help heal his trauma and show him how good life can be

Another case of a young woman falling in love with someone that appears to be in need of care. That's not your fault, we are taught to be caretakers.   
He is an adult man, and even if he has trauma and/or mental health issues, that's not your position to take care of (even if you are a mental health specialist, you are involved, it's not your place).  
Romantic relationships are supposed to be a fair trade of one giving support and love to the other. If only one takes care, it's called parenthood. 

>from that moment he fell completely in love with me and how I handled the situation made him realise we can be together and we aren’t so different.

That's your point of view. You can't state that. He could even have said it to you, but what he feels is not in your domain of knowledge. You are not a omnisciente narrator.

i could quote more problmeatic lines but it would take a long time.  


cutting short: you two already have a bad dynamic. He is able to change, and you are able to be stronger, but hardly it will happen to you two when you are together. If you really love him, wish him the best and let him go. You also have some healing (and growing) to do. You sound young, life will be kind if you take your time to heal now."	milkymoo111	reply	na	na	na	0.005589833948761225	weak	strong	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.
"Look, you're both super young.

It's not the time for ""love of my life"" stuff. Love happens all the time. I know it doesn't seem like it's possible right now, but you could be in love and feel exactly the same but without all this bullshit attached.

This guy's not ready and you don't have to wait.

It's going to take years for him to fix himself, if he ever does.

Plus all the cheating? Using your toys on other girls?

Ask anyone else; this shit would've not only ended relationships, but all, total, 100% contact with the guy. Dude's got like 5 red flags up his pole and you're like ""but I love him!!"" 

I mean damn, even most decent men would agree he needs his ass kicked by other men for that.

You know how when you see a nice girl go with a POS guy and you wonder why she sticks around? You're doing that. You're that girl we pity if you stay with this guy.

This is the moment where your girlfriends would clap in your face to ""wake you up"" and save you from a bad situation.

Time to make a big decision. Cut him out. Wish him good luck and move yourself on to better times. 

You'll look back on this time as ""when you made mistakes"" and this guy is gonna be Exhibit A. Please don't burn your 20s on some barely-adult multi-cheating coke fiend who probably *talks* and *talks*, trying to ""reason"" with his ""oh I have another side"" nonsense. He's doesn't even sound like he's good at doing coke, ffs.

Mend your heart. Do it *away* from him. Doesn't have to be forever, but dammit, get away so the heartbreak can clear up and you can think straight again. Give yourself the chance to get out of the storm so you can assess the situation properly.

"Ah recreational drugs the bane of life. Honestly this is a tougher because of how in love with him you are but the thing is with drugs they will always worsen a person. I sympathise that his childhood was fucked up and his mom was a junkie but hes turned himself into a junkie too. How many people come from traumatizing childhoods then condone their shitry behaviour based on how they were raised and brought up etc... I'll tell you, alot. But not as much as you think. People from impoverished backgrounds go on to achieve brilliantly and use their trauma as fuel to do greater things. But your partner is choosing the other side of this spectrum poor me, the ""i had a bad childhood, poor me, it's not me it's the cocaine, I wont do it again but deep down I will I just wont tell you and I'll be more secretive about it and when you eventually confront me again I'll be hostile but it wont be from me because you know me its really the drugs it's really the cocaine"". I've heard it all before. My advice to you is you deserve better despite how you feel about him. You know he needs help but you cant help someone who refuses help this you already know. Now bare this in mind and I apologise if this upsets you, cocaine much like majuanana is a gateway drug which means the heavy shit like MDMA, HEROIN, ACID etc ... is what follows and if dont kill him it will kill you. Now whether that's emotionally or physically it will kill you because the drug comes first sadly not you. 

So leave him, obviously you dont need to listen to what I have said and hopefully someone else can comment something clearer and more resonating but my way is the hard way and the hard way protects you.

Sorry, OP, but he’s right—he’s not worthy of you and he has proven that multiple times. Whether he’s an addict, self-sabotaging life victim, or just a POS, he needs to get help and save himself, you cannot do it for him. Do not set yourself on fire to keep this man warm when he has so little regard and respect for you he will bring another woman into YOUR home and bed. I don’t care what your trauma is, deliberately hurting someone who loves you is cruel—cheating is never ok.  Please recognize he’s now caused trauma to you.

I (25m) have been hooking up with a friend (22f) for about a month and a half now. We get along really well and have good sex, but we defined our relationship as FWB only a while back. I’ve caught feelings for her.  Last night she told me that I am her closest friend and that she thinks we should stop having sex because she doesn’t want to jeopardize our friendship. I told her that I would prefer to be something more than friends with her, but that I understood that she said she doesn’t want a BF right now. She said that she would like to talk about it more the next day. Today (the next day) I saw her driving by me on the road and I texted her and asked if I had just passed by her. She responded with “no” but I’m positive it was her, same car, looked exactly like her. I don’t know why she would lie about this.  I did not expect to catch feelings for this girl, but I know now that I want her around. I know I can’t just be friends with her, but I don’t wanna lose her completely. What should I do?

Patience is a virtue! Maybe try to give her the friendship for awhile and see how it plays out, she might want to get to know you when sex isn’t a part of the equation to see if you’re compatible.

Just read this back to yourself. Why would you have to do the work to accommodate mean people? The only work you have to do is to ask yourself why you even asked this question. A person with healthy boundaries, wouldn’t even ask this. They would just immediately remove themselves from any situation that makes them uncomfortable for whatever reason.

"Yes I do. But you said they stay *because* they’re a-holes. Abusers don’t typically start a first date like “hey I’m gonna abuse you in some way or another at some point! Wanna date me anyways!?” They start off sweet, charming, and love them. Then they eventually become manipulative, they isolate you, and they make you believe you don’t deserve any better.

When people try to leave an abusive relationship is when they’re the most vulnerable and often get murdered. People can do everything right—report it to the police, get protective orders, move out, etc—and their abusers will still find them. Just leaving is not always that simple my friend."

"I see it everywhere in a professional life, people scouring for any way to move as high up as they can. They push me to it and I’m driven to follow, but halfway through that process I can’t take it seriously, life is so quick and I don’t want work to be my life, I don’t want the conquest of a constantly ascending career only to never be satisfied.

I came from poverty, moved up financially, got married, have the happiest puppies, more than I could ever want. But everyone tells me I need to want more, I should aim for more, when I don’t get it or aim for it, I get looked down upon as if I am wasting my time. It’s exhausting to have overcome all that I have to be told I need more.

When a manager tells me if I don’t get a promotion I’m likely to get fired from a team it’s a scary thought. i do my work, I don’t go above and beyond, that should be okay, right? 
But this goes in the endless engine of production where a promotion isn’t a promotion it’s a lifeline.

"So I'm a 5,10 (178cm) girl. I have had two guys like me but things don't add up. I always get compliments from friends and family, even from the family of friends, they say I'm cute, pretty, oh you look so hot in that, omg ur so cute, u look like a model. 
But I never get hit on by anyone, and two days ago I started thinking that it may be that I'm too tall for guys. Two days ago I was at a party with two friends and a guy approached my friend and said 'I saw u and I think your gorgeous can I buy you something?', she has a boyfriend so she rejected him and he asked if any of us were single, and she pointed at me. He looked me up and down and left. It hurt, and even more when I heard him say she's good but too tall. I just feel like my height is a turn of to most guys.

You can be brutally honest, promise I've heard worse lol.

Edit: A lot of people are telling me to not mind that guy and that he was an ass, so I'll clarify. I didn't like the guy, he was an ass and he was hitting on every girl he saw. It's just an example from some days ago.

6' tall woman here. I have definitely been hit on before, many times. It honestly just depends on how you carry yourself. Confidence is key, it's not just about height. I didn't get hit on in my younger years when I loathed how tall I was. I had a roommate who was also 6' tall and she got hit on constantly, and I would be right next to her. I honestly assumed it was because she was skinnier than me, since we were the same height. But when I learned to embrace my height and accept that I couldn't get any shorter, I started to love myself more for it, there was a DEFINITE difference in how men interacted with me.

I am 5’1 and back in school days I felt, only if I grew taller, my figure would look more proportionate. I am curvy but I always wanted to be skinny and straight (no curves). I felt somehow that was more beautiful and appealing. 
And so I tried having green tea etc just so I could reduce my curves. Unfortunately, I did become skinny (only for a while) but lost my appetite and fell sick. The recovery phase taught me that I should be more accepting to my body, my height and my shape. 

There were many boys who were upfront about going for skinny girls and honestly, there are so many guys out there, each with a different preference. But in 2019, I found a guy who actually loves me for me as a whole and compliments my personality (which is most important).

Brutally honest. In general guys don’t like women who are tall or taller than them because it’s seen as a masculine trait. Most men prefer women short because they are seen as more feminine. Men in general don’t like masculine traits because at the end of the day they don’t want to date a “man”.

"I’m a male, 6’1” and I have to say when it comes to dating, men generally “like a girl who’s short” but I always thought of that as a cop out. They get unsecured about their dick and need to feel better about themselves by going for short girls instead of taller or bigger girls. Thats how I always saw it anyways. I never had a type when it came to women. Tall, short, skinny, curvy, blonde, brunette, white, black, Hispanic etc., however I am with my fiancé now who is 5’9” and just remember when you find a tall man who doesn’t have a complex about feeling small, one day you’re going to have tall children with him. 

As for guys approaching your friend at a party instead of you - TELL ME ABOUT IT. I’m a decent looking guy but my best friend growing up had chicks ALL OVER HIM. Any time an attractive girl approached me it would be to ask about my friend or asking me to mention them to him. Lmao crappiest feeling ever!

"Just shy of 5’9” here (cause of my proportions I think I’m almost always judged by others to be taller than I am, up to 6’ lol). 

As far as I’m aware of, my height has never been an issue for anyone or been a turn off for anyone I’ve dated/crushed on, maybe everyone was being nice? Maybe it was something that went over my head? I don’t really worry about my height being an issue. (And I’m definitely not hot, so it’s not my looks making up for “being too tall”). Dated guys that were my height/just a bit shorter, they didn’t seem to mind. The really tall guys I’ve dated like that they don’t have to bend down to kiss or hug me or strain their neck looking down at me. Also they are super amused that my legs are as long or almost as long as theirs. I get lots of compliments for being very leggy no matter how tall the guy is. Idk I was short/average until like Junior year of high school and kept growing after I was 18. I was teased when I was short but I’ve never really been teased for being taller and maybe that’s why I like it and don’t mind…unless I’m pant shopping. 

My mom is taller than me and it doesn’t seem like it was an issue for her, my dad is also shorter than us both. I have a friend that’s over 6’ all she’s dated are guys that are shorter than her (except one?) she got hit on all the time, but like that’s not good attention, nor did she want it. (When I was online dating in my 20s so many guys shorter than me were really into me being taller than them?). I know a handful of other female friends that are my height or taller, the only struggle we talk about really is finding good men that are at least 3-4 inches taller than us. Maybe that’s what we’re attracted to physically but that really limits your dating pool so it can’t be an absolute must have. Oh well, there are more important things and so much else that makes a person attractive. 

I think for above average height 5’9” kind of feels like the sweet spot. Average height for guys is 5’10” so you are still shorter than most guys and even if you are taller it’s likely not by much. Also you can still maybe find clothes in stores that fit you depending on your proportions and cut of the clothes."	joana_014	reply	na	na	na	0.9978131055831909	no	strong	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.

"5’10” here. Get hit on occasionally but never as much as my friends. I used to overthink it but I think a lot of men are intimidated. I worked with my fiance for over a year before he ever spoke to me and he told me he always had a crush on me but was just too shy to say anything and assumed I was out of his league. He’s the same height as me. It’s a little funny when I wear heels but in general, it isn’t even a thing. I know it’s cliche but it’s true that when you meet the right person they’re going to be obsessed with you. 

As far as the guy who disrespected you: If someone looks past you because you’re tall then they aren’t who you belong with anyway so don’t give them the power to offend you.

"Unfortunately there's a huge stigma in society regarding height and dating. There's tons of us guys who honestly don't give a shit about height and would date a girl taller than us. But the issue is that most men are very calculated when it comes to walking up to a girl and hitting on her. If we know that our chances of rejection are pretty high, we honestly won't even approach you. We can think you're absolutely beautiful, but we still won't hit on you.

It's unfortunate tbh. But that's the sad reality. Your height is definitely playing a role in guys not hitting on you. However, if you honestly don't care about height and you're fine with a man who's shorter than you, then please walk up to them and strike up a conversation! I, along with many other men do not care about height differences (that's not to say that every guy doesn't care about it. Bc there are definitely assholes that do), and I've seen plenty of girls taller than me that I thought were beautiful. But did I have the balls to walk up to them and hit on them? Nope. Bc in my mind the chances of getting rejected were waaaay too high. Had they walked up to me and started talking to me I would have been super happy.

So to recap: 

The guy at that party was a douche.

Yes your height plays a role in you not having men approach you. 

Most men don't give af about height or height differences 

The conventional play for courting out in the world doesn't work the same for every single person. Play the game the way it works for you. Aka, YOU be the one to put yourself out there and walk up to a guy if u think he's cute or nice or wtvr other criteria you have for him."	joana_014	reply	na	na	na	0.9978131055831909	no	strong	no	na	offmychest	failed
I have the same problem as you except I’m a short guy. Like abnormally short, at 5’0”. And no, you’re not too tall. There are a lot of guys who wouldn’t mind dating girls taller than them, including me. My last girlfriend is 5’9” and wore platform shoes every time we went out, so that put her up to 6 feet. Another one of my exes is 5’7”. Point is, just find someone who doesn’t care.	joana_014	reply	na	na	na	0.9978131055831909	weak	strong	no	na	offmychest	failed
Y’all girls are super attractive. I’m 6’ 1 and I’d definitely be interested in someone your height. Like many other men have said in this post just spontaneously hitting on women out in the world isn’t always the most comfortable thing and usually men get the “that’s creepy” look/reaction.	joana_014	reply	na	na	na	0.9978131055831909	weak	strong	no	na	offmychest	failed
No offense but you’re a kid, people probably shouldn’t be hitting on you. In your age range most people are insecure and scared of flirting and hitting on people. When you get older it’ll probably be more common for better or worse. I’m 5’10” and have dated girls who are 6’1” like just give it time and don’t worry about it. Just enjoy being a kid and eventually you’ll find someone.	joana_014	reply	na	na	na	0.9978131055831909	weak	no	no	na	offmychest	failed

This right here. I felt I was like a giraffe when I was younger and was even called that a few times lol You need to feel good in your skin and others need to feel that when they look at you

I wear 5 cm heels and platforms now and F anyone who has anything to say about my height. They make my legs look nice.

Own it OP. Love yourself! Also, trust me, you wouldn't want some insecure dude who feels inferior cause his gorgeous girl is as tall or taller than him. What kind of man would that be for you? You also need someone confident who loves you for you.

"So it all rolls back 4 years ago when i was still in releatonship with my ex. Can't say it was bad releatonship or beautiful, somwhere in the middle. There were good and bad days but there came a time when living became very expensive and difficult so we had to pack our bags and move to a place where we just could earn more. It all started when we moved into her aunts (she was in her 30s) home for the first time until we settle on our feet. Then i started noticing she acted too kind on me like i was her best friend of something but i didn't think of it too much as i truly hard loved my gf and cheating never came into my mind like a thing i would do.

So some time passed and we were doing fine and we actually moved out and got our own place. We were settling down and everything was nice when i saw a change in my girls behaviour. She started going out very often which she almost never did before. She started to stay the nights and her friends houses and she became really protective over her phone which i understood very quickly as a red flag. Then her biggest flop was i caught her making almost nudes pictures in bathroom which she did only when we were dating. I didn't say nothing of it because i really hate arguments and fighting and of what i saw i just let the ship burn and see what she does next.

Then next friday we went to her Aunts house just for a party we were drinking and my girl passed out completely wasted so i stayed with the Aunt still up. As i got bit more drunk i opened up about what happened and the Aunt acted like she knew it and started to hug me saying how sorry she is and this shouldnt happen to me, i don't deserve it and what was craziest she started kissing me something was saying my brain to stop but i just couldnt it felt somewhat reliefing. Very strange feeling. Well it ended with sex we both went to sleep seperate and night ended there but not fully.

Next day when we went with my girl home her Aunt texted me saying how she thinks it was not a good thing to do but she also liked it. I responded to her just lets make sure nobody knows about this and that it dosen't happen again which happened exactly next 2 times we were partying together with me in the end starting to like her somewhat.

We were there partying total like 4 times and after that we stopped going there. But it all changed when my ex started to blatantly meeting other dudes like a year later, talking with them. So we broke up then. I understood that Aunt may catched a guilty feeling so i asked her did she tell something on which she replied if i did prorably she would beat us up by now so no, i will never speak about it then i explained what happened and she also tought that she maybe somehow knows.

But she didn't. Turns out she has been cheating on me long before ive even met her Aunt she blatantly put this into my face as she has done something. I never spoke about the situation with me and Aunt to her even after what she did. But did i do the correct right thing? Or should i have said yeah you cheated on me but ive fucked your Aunt.  Im not that person who could just openly say this.

However till this day its all weird time for me and lot to learn from."	kruldasmen-dikantren	post	18.348471669358872	female	White	0.0059640249237418175	na	na	na	3	offmychest	failed
i went through this exact same scenario with my ex’s mom… even up to my gf cheating. it’s better you didn’t say anything. i’m sure you probably want to hurt her, but keep in mind you also did technically cheat and with a family member no less. it’s best to just move on with your life. i’m sorry you went through this.	kruldasmen-dikantren	reply	na	na	na	0.0059640249237418175	weak	strong	no	na	offmychest	failed
In my opinion, it's good you didn't say nothing. Honestly, so what if she cheated and all that. She simply didn't like you enough and that's fine. There's no need to let your emotions control you and seek revenge. It's not worth it.

"I am so, so sick of judgmental folks blaming parents when teenagers do dumb, stupid, criminal things. It really shouldn’t be a reflection of someone’s parenting.

I’m not the best mom, but I’ve done my absolute best for my kids. They’ve always been to the doctor and dentist for check-ups, therapists and counselors as needed, been give anything the could want/need, braces, enrollment in sports and extracurricular activities (I was even the team mom once), I was a SAHM during the pandemic, so I was there to help them through their school work…I’m not abusive. I tell them I love them all the time. I’m interested in what they’re doing. I don’t have a criminal record myself nor do I have, or have ever had, a substance abuse problem.

But…even so, my kid managed to get himself into some trouble and he’s currently incarcerated. Despite my warnings and pleas. Despite my involvement in his life. Despite my lack of involvement in crime and illegal substances…He’s still in trouble.

"I(49m) seem to have hit the end of what I can’t handle it anymore. I am in the middle of a month from hell. About a month of ago my girlfriend dumped me because you had to deal with things with her ex. We have been hanging out a lot and she even stays over most nights. The problem is she drops everything for this ex. They were engaged for 6 years, and he was very abusive and controlling.  She doesn’t see it. But all the signs She if she said no when he wanted sex, he would emotionally punish her until she gave in. He would have to always be around when she went out with friends. There are a few more I can’t think of. We got into a fight over the last few days because she has become one of his main emotional supports.  She feels it is ok because we broke up and I agree but it still hurts me, and I would like her to take my feeling into consideration which she admits she doesn’t. On a side note he has no idea I exist. She has been telling him the whole time we have been together that she isn’t interested in dating anyone currently.  Because I said I don’t want to keep talking if she is talking to him anymore. She said I was being controlling. I do still love her and want the best for her. I just can’t handle the situation. She was my sole emotional support.  
That is more the background. Now what has me at the point of not knowing if I can keep going. My mom just got diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time and is having it removed. It supposedly isn’t a big deal but my dad died of cancer so it still hit me hard. She generally doesn’t like talking about it and she seems to be avoiding me right now. My daughter (22) only seems to talk to me when she needs something and just tried to take out a student loan in my name. My girlfriend lived with me for 2 months and increased my bills by 250-300 a month and I was living paycheck to paycheck. I kept saying I was fine, but money is going to get super tight and I just used saving to pay off the extra. I took last Monday off to spend it with her, and she said she would help me cover expenses because of it and now she is gone.  I generally feel like my life is falling apart.   
It really feels like I have nothing left. I am sure I must push people away and I am going to consoling to work on that but I am not even sure I have the money to pay for the session right now. I don’t hate myself and am generally a happy person. I just want to curl up and disappear.

"First off you need to set some hard boundaries with this girl, possibly even cut her out of your life. Don't let her stay over, she's not a roommate or girlfriend anymore. She's sadly made it clear she will pick her ex over you, and you don't need to deal with that. It is taking a huge mental toll on you just based on what you've said here.

On to your mom: I'm sorry she's shutting you out, but she's dealing with a lot right now. Just call or text her from time to time so she knows you're still there for her once she gets through this.

You are in a really rough spot right now, but you can and will make it out of this! You can take care of the gf situation, it sounds like your mom will be okay after surgery, and with your gf gone you won't have those extra expenses anymore.

Look into government assistance as well, you may qualify for medicaid or rent assistance."	Dalagante74	reply	na	na	na	0.9991225600242615	no	no	no	na	offmychest	failed

"#Before anyone comes at me, I’m not talking about pedophiles who act on it or watch child porn, only pedophiles who understand they have a problem and would never act on it

There is so much hate towards pedophiles online, which I do completely get, pedophiles who act on their wants are sick people. However, I feel bad for people who understand they have a problem but have limited options of getting help for it. These people understand they have a problem and really wish they could overcome it, but they get so much hate every day. They can’t talk about it with anyone without feeling they will be chastised and if face to face like their life is in danger. They most likely experience suicidal thoughts daily because they know there isn’t away for them to change. Very little therapist have actually experience in how to helps these people, so there it’s a long shot for them get the proper help they need. Even if there is one, there’s a good chance insurance can’t or won’t cover it, and they don’t make enough to pay out of pocket.

This is all because society has outcast them so harshly, thinking that every pedophile is someone who acts on their wants. When that just isn’t the case, a lot of these people feel sick to their own stomach knowing they get grouped in with the people who don’t control themselves. Yet, despite people hating them, have no want in their heart to actually help or show sympathy for the ones who also hate themselves."

"I think people are just scared for kids. I mean, what should they do, show some support to the pedophiles? Sure, pedophiles need professional help, but how do you even know which pedophile would never act on his wants and which pedophile would be just playing innocent while looking for an opportunity? How do you know if they can - or want to - resist their urges? 

So, what, show them some support or give them a platform of any sort, offer them sympathy and opportunity to be seen and heard, and what you'll achieve? You'll only put more kids in danger. And incident happens in a moment of their supposed weakness and kid gets traumatized for life. So many pedophiles will take advantage of it to justify themselves.

As much as I can understand that it's a mental disorder and that some of them genuinely want to get help, I still can't find any sympathy for their ""struggles"" or whatever you want to call it. Kids are a priority. You just don't risk it. Do whatever it takes to keep them safe. If the fear inflicted on pedophiles - of becoming an outcast, everyone hating them, losing their family or opportunity to have a decent job and form meaningful relationship - will keep one more innocent kid safe from life-long trauma, then this is the way. Scare the shit out of them, tell them what prisoners in prison do to pedophiles, how the world would see them, anything, if that fear will keep them from harming a child."

"I completely get that and I’m not saying anyone show allow their kids around them even if they are getting help. But I see people all the time saying “pedophiles should be killed” or “pedophiles aren’t people”, like yes the ones who are actively doing it but there’s way more out there who aren’t doing it. And statistics prove that. And having a specific place they can go, like an AA but for pedophiles or a specific website for them to enter, is way easier to manage. And it’s not like kids are going to actively seek out being hurt like that, and it’s not hard to make it so people have to give an ID to enter. Especially with a specific in person place to go too.

I’m fine with actively putting fear it them, but we can also do more then that too. The ones who never act on their wants clearly understand the consequences of if they were to act on it, and better yet the fact that it’s morally wrong to do it. The majority of all pedophiles were sexually abused when they were young, like 2/3, which point it’s a want to take innocent from someone else like someone did to them. And over all, at that point it’s really just about healer their inner child who was hurt and wants revenge for what was done to them. They’re people who never got the help they needed when they were a child and had that happen to them. 

So knowing all of this, we should be helping the kids who do get sexually abused at a young age so they don’t become pedophiles, and then the who’s who haven’t acted on it. The ones who have acted on it should just be in prison the rest of their life because it’s the only way they won’t be able to hurt a child again, chemically castrated them doesn’t stop them."

I take antidepressants and have for about 5 years now, and everyone knows a side effect can be loss of libido. I can’t go without my meds, and my partner agrees with this, but he constantly asks if I want to have sex, brings up how long it’s been since we last did, or complains that I don’t love him because I don’t want to have sex. I’ve even gotten to the point where I told him we can open up our relationship if he wants to fulfill his sexual needs with other people, because I know that’s an important thing and I feel insanely guilty, but it just feels like a chore when it comes down to it. rant over i guess lmao	squeakybuggy	post	21.524903362515484	female	White	0.9990481734275818	na	na	na	0	offmychest	failed
"i got assaulted in my sleep and i don’t have the energy to get myself together. i have two dogs and a cat and i haven’t let them out to the bathroom or clean the litter box. the house is a mess and my youngest dog tore up everything. my couch, my rug, the cat scratcher thing you name it she ate it. she ate the damn window sill. 

i finally got groceries today and fed the dogs and got myself food but i doordashed it because i can’t leave my house. i haven’t showered i haven’t brushed my teeth and the floor is just nasty. 

i have a really bad history of picking bad guys on accident idk how i do it my last bf was a pedo who cheated on me with a teenager and before that the other one threatened to kill me. i’m taking time trying to find someone nice and i had this happen. i feel like there’s no hope for me. 

i want to relapse and hurt myself and i don’t want to be in this house or this state, i don’t even want to be.

i know i need to clean i need to eat i need to wash myself and the cat because she’s dirty too. she’s old and can’t bathe herself either. but she has a better excuse than me. 

i want to be better but idk how to get out of this. i don’t want to sleep on my bed. 

when i got the forensics kit done they took my favorite shirt because it was evidence. 

there’s to much to do and i can’t do it. what’s the point if i’m just gonna be this thing for people to always hurt? i don’t know who i am anymore. 

like i gotta leave the bed to brush my teeth and it’ll take forever to untangle my hair then i have to shower and put on clothes and they don’t feel right. then i have to clean and it has to be done right because i need to pick up the mess the dogs made, mop and sweep and toss the destroyed furniture. i have to clean the dishes to use them to cook food and i have to prepare the food to cook it and clean the counter to prepare food. and that’s just the house outside the bedroom. how the hell am i supposed to wash sheets? wash my clothes because everything is dirty. this whole house is dirty and i match it. my pets don’t deserve this.

how do i go to work tomorrow and see my sister? how do i look at her? how do i smile at people at work and not be everyone’s problem. i can’t ask my mom to help me i’m so embarrassed about everything. i can never tell my dad he won’t make anything better it’ll get worse. my mom prayed over me at the hospital and i wanted to scream there’s no god. god doesn’t let this happen to people. i’m a fucking satanist and she’s praying for me to find shelter in god after a religious christian man hurt me in my sleep. i don’t want to even call it what it is. one of gods people fucking did this to me and where was he? i don’t hate christians but damn i can’t take them trying to fix me with god right now. i’m angry and alone and i want to fix this but it feels like it’s supposed to be this way. 

is it really broken if i deserve this?

"I don't even know shere to start since I'm about to cry.

  
I'm 23 and I've lost all my friends.

One and a half year ago, one of my friends sent me a message telling me that she doesn't want to hang out with me anymore and go no explaination about this decision. I mean, I can understand, but oh gosh this is hard to have no clue why this is happening. I still have troubles admitting her decision, but I guess I just have to live with it.  
A few months ago, I asked my friends if they wanted to hang out and they all said yes without ever ginving any date (while I did, and asked them again when we could meet every few weeks before giving up). More recently, I asked a friend if we could eat together some day since I haven't seen her for (at least) the last five months. She said she would keep me in touch, but she hasn't, and she didn't even look at my last message while she kept talking to other people on twitter. Me and one of my friends stopped seeing each other almost as soon as he found a new girlfriend.  
But to be honest, the hardest part is about whom I've considered to be my best friends for the last ten years. He didn't reply to the last messages I sent him (4 messages, sent about one week apart). Today, I learned that he is spending time with online friends (who I also know and who I've met and spent time with too, last year they all slept at my house for a week and we were all together for new year's eve too). He litteraly lives 5 minutes away from me. He could have told me so that we could all see each other, but decided not to. I feel evicted.  
To finish with, I have an online friend who stopped sending the first message (we were on an equal footage, sometimes whe was sending the first message, other times it was me), and now I haven't had any news for a week while two months ago we were still talking to each other every single day.

  
And they're all interacting with each other on twitter. And none of them reacted to my tweets, nor responded to my answers to their tweets. I feel evicted by all of them. I feel like I've just been there to make them meet each other and now that my job is done, they don't need me anymore.

  
I don't know if I messed up somewhere. Since the year started, I sure changed: I got a job, I got my driver's licence, I started going to the gym, I uninstalled TikTok, I drastically reduced the amount of time spent playing League of Legends, I stopped being so involved in politics since it made me angry, sad and feel helpless... I can't say I haven't changed. But you know what? These changes I'm proud of since it all helped me have a better mental health, I can't help thinking they're the reasons why my friends stopped interacting with me.  
I still have the same tastes, the same sense of humor, the same goals. I'm just a better version of myself (still not as good as what I would like to be, but I'm on my way) and I'm pretty sure this is the thing bothering them. Some of them still have no job or aren't pleased with what they're doing while I am. They're still depressed while I helped myself and succeeded. I told them how I did to feel better, because I want them to feel better too. I've told them I was there if they needed to do something. I've always been there for them. And I'm pretty sure that because I feel better and they don't, they stopped talking to me. I don't know what could be the reason of them not talking to me anymore if it is not this gap between our mental healths. I remember poor mental health has always been at the center of the conversation, but I feel like they don't want to talk with people who aren't like them anymore.

  
I know I might be wrong. If you've got any idea why the situation is like so, or if you have any tips to deal with this (I know time is the answer, but any tip to help me be okay with the situation faster is welcome), let me know.

"I haven’t been able to shake something off and I’ve stopped myself from rabbit hole-ing and rewriting my toxic relationship… but I learned recently that my ex paid off his football season tickets and he has yet to pay me back for the abortion that we had months ago. He had lost his job, wasn't in a place financially to cover the costs and we had an agreement. I think it just pains me to know that ultimately it feels like I meant nothing to him other than an ATM. And that I feel so used. 

It shouldn’t surprise me and idk why I expected anything other than what he’s shown. But that…. That hurt. Like you couldn’t ever get it together to take me on a proper date or pay me back for an incredibly painful point in our relationship but yet you found the resources for your shitty team - days after we ended. I just hate him so much.  It helps in the letting go part but it just feels even more painful. I hate how low my self-worth tanked and I allowed anyone to treat me like that. 

Ultimately I'm grateful that I did not have a child with this person. That I was able to see my self-worth and what I deserve. Despite all the ""I love you""s and ""I'll do better"", I knew that this person's words and actions never matched up. 

I ended the relationship with such a grateful heart for our relationship, my own growth through it, and never wanted it be contentious. It just hurts to see that I ultimately did not mean anything to this person and I was never the priority. 

Welp that's enough of my pity party and I will root for your team to lose every single game this season.  I hope they rank dead last in their conference and the overall league. "	throwthreenine	post	30.09638386604336	male	White	0.9989182949066162	na	na	na	1	offmychest	failed

"Hi, this is going to be long. I don't expect anybody to read it, but I just wanted to get rid of this and have this post as a record that I will come back to check next year and say ""Damn, what a time"".

  
I am a questionable human. I cut off my 5-year relationship with this girl from my hometown in Colombia to date a cute white American girl I met working at a working holiday program near Cleveland in 2021, while I was 21 and she was 17. Her parents agreed on everything and loved me. Of course, nobody, not even this new girl, knew I had to break up with this girl so I could start dating her. My visa eventually expired as the summer finished and all the international workers had to go back home, so we decided to do long distance. 

  
Back at home, my ex looked for me, and I looked for her, reached out and pretty much dated again. So now I was dating two girls, one in my hometown and the other long distance. Time passes and I had to move to London, where I am currently writing this. The Colombian girl couldn't move with me, and she was so heavily emotionally dependent on me that she also bet for a long distance while I was in London. Although my first visa was only for 6 months, I knew I was in for the long term and I eventually enrolled on a master's ever since Jan 2022 when I moved, I have only gone to Bogota to visit, so technically I call the UK my home. I dated these two girls at the same time until June 2022, 6 months after I left, when I decided I couldn't hurt the Colombian girl anymore since anyway I wanted something new, different, what the American girl offered was more appealing to me. Of course, that broke her heart. Especially even more when she realized this American girl came to visit me in London a few times and she was coming by the end of August 2022 again. I did the typical cheater stuff, hide chats, erased pics, everything so none knew about the other and, besides some slips, I was nasty and successful in it.

  
I should have known that dating a girl 4 years younger than me was going to be challenging considering that while I was about to start my masters in the UK, she was finishing high school and about to start her 1st year at Uni. I also should have given more time to the 'talking' phase to find out who this girl really was, instead of asking her to be my girlfriend after one month of hanging out pretty much every day but in the environment of the summer, working as lifeguards in a very different setting. Two years it's been since that. Actually, we celebrated our 2nd anniversary with this American girl last week, she came to visit me for a few days. But she left yesterday, and that left me quite destroyed again.

  
It's been a very intense ride. As you can imagine, with the distance and the different stages we are in life everything is challenging. It's only during very brief periods that my relationship feels easy, the rest of the time it feels very rough like a lot of work and tiring. Of course, that the lack of knowledge of the other didn't play in our favour either. I idealized her since she presented herself one way so I could like her and I idealized her too since I found her exotic and interesting, also, because it happens I have a heavily addictive personality and I can manipulate and come up with very different behaviours than the way I truly am just so people can like me and I feel I can fit in groups (yeah, I have very low self-esteem, although I would say now is just a bit low, I am working on it, therapy and everything).
  

  

  
In September last year, when I was starting my master's in the UK, we went through a rough patch with my American girl (although, as I say, everything feels like a rough patch). She talked with me about some feelings she had about us and the relationship, which were valid and right, and I told her I was also very scared because I felt the same and I didn't know why things were working the way they were, and that I felt I should start therapy since this is been chasing me for quite a while and I felt I couldn't deal with it myself and started to feel it was snow bowling quite fast.
  
That’s how I started therapy, where I found out my heavy addictive personality, lack of self-esteem and an affinity for parties, drugs and alcohol. From that September to today, I have been attending weekly sessions, that has helped immensely, also have been attending 12-step groups and being really strict with a lifestyle that allows staying out of trouble, such as dating two girls at a time, playing with people’s feelings and faking who I am so I can make ""friends"" and be ""attractive"" This is been a very costly process, in money and effort, since I had to unfold myself almost completely so I could rebuild everything from pretty much scrats. It’s been gratifying but demanding. I am not proud of the things I did but I am trying to be a better person and I am indeed very different from the person I was a few years back. I would like this to not be overlooked.

  
Because of the way I was before, my American girl suffered a lot. Although she never found out about the other girl, she still had to deal with me going to the club every weekend, watching me post stories with other girls, not answering or texting for hours during the nights, and I was very rude and when she wanted to call me (long distance) so we could catch up, I would make up excuses and, to be honest, I didn't enjoy calling much anyway, at that point. She was very patient with me, and I feel very bad these days because after the therapy I came to realize the many horrible behaviours I had and came to understand many of the feelings she went through because of that. Lots of loneliness and sadness, an experience I am very shameful to give her considering I am her first boyfriend and lover.
  

  

  
Nonetheless, it’s been also very challenging to deal with the cultural shocks dating a stranger brings, added to the fact we idealized the other. This has made me feel quite ignored and overlooked in many regards. I don't know if it’s a cultural thing or different love languages, but it’s been very hard. Things like being romantic, sending letters, speaking sweet words or reading out loud poems, being caring etc don't produce much of a reaction, which breaks my heart. She has other gestures of love, which I appreciate, but I also would like mine to be seen or to be put in the place they deserve.
  
My girl has come back to work at the place we met lifeguarding two years ago during the past summers (2022 and 2023). She has met friends and made a life there, and now it’s been my turn to pay for all I did to my Colombian girl. This American girl I met is not shy and quiet anymore, now she loves partying and doesn't have a problem with barely chatting with me or calling me for weeks since all she cared about was her job and her new friends and life. This is exactly what I did when I was there, the same reasons the Colombian girl suffered so much are being applied to me, and I feel upset because I feel I don't have the right to say a word because that’s being such a hypocrite. I am sad because after my therapy I finally became a bit of a better human, sensitive (very) and empathic. Now I want the calls, I want to know of her and give her the love and attention she missed during the time I moved to London, and I was behaving like an ass. What bothers me is that she seems very busy to dedicate that time to me but not to her friends. But again, I did the same with the Colombian girl, I know how is to work in that place so I can't blame my American girlfriend to behave that way. 
  

  

  
After her last visit, she left yesterday as I mentioned, and I am left with my heart in my hand because we had a good time, and I knew that when she came back home it was going to be the same way it’s been during the last 4 months she has been working there. And said and done. Today I have not heard much from her, I can see how she's active on her socials, and posts pics and stories with friends but didn't post much about our anniversary or her recent visit to England. She has time to check WhatsApp, snap and IG but not time to reply to my text. I may have done horrible things in the past, but I am trying to move on and improve, I don't feel I deserve this. I did the same to somebody else, yes, but I also feel I have paid a lot of the pain I caused going through therapy, processing the feelings I had, and I caused and attending my 12 steps meetings program. I am not sure if she's not interested in me anymore, but she still comes to visit me (with the expenses and time it implies), I ask if she is in love with me and she says yes, I try to break up after a heavy arguing and she says she can’t leave without me and ask me to please not leave.
  

  

  
Then why she doesn't treat me as the priority I am supposed to be, and I think I deserve to be? 
  

  

  
I am sorry, I know this is very long and unnecessary, just wanted to get it out of my chest. I am very in love with this girl, I think she is a treasure, but this moment makes me very scared since makes me feel I should be with somebody who treats me the way I treat my partner, with lots of details and attention and love. Make me a priority as I do of her and my relationship. It's uncertain if we ever are going to close the gap. I don't want to be treated like this anymore, I am not that bad person anymore.

"Oh well... I believe in karma and it feels like you have it coming for you. 🙁 I'm sorry you feel like this. I'm pretty sure she's not even noticing what she's doing to you. I mean you did the same to her, so maybe she thinks that you're okay with that and that's what you want. She's probably having the phase when she's busy, living her life, going out and stuff... I mean she's still younger than you and you already had this phase. You should definitely talk to her about your feelings or she'll never understand what you are going through. And it's just a guess but what if she has somebody else in the picture? I mean you did, no offense. Any chance? 🥺

"Just as the title says, my job keeps messing with me and everything else is stressful too. Let me give you a list:

1. I apply to a job in May, letting them know in my application I have a trip planned in August. I also submit a time off request, but they never approved or denied it so it never showed up and they scheduled me. I talked to them, and they told me to just call off, but that it would go on my record as me calling off and affect my recors of going to work EVEN THOUGH I LET THEM KNOW DAY 1 I WOULD BE GONE!

2. Follow up to this, I forgot to call if that first day in our app. They are now calling it a no call no show and I am being reprimanded. They knew about this trip from application, why is it my fault!

3. They denied my Availability Request for my Fall Semester at college, EVEN THOUGH THEY SAID THAT THE REQUEST WAS GOING TO BE ACCEPTED. The request showed what times I have classes, but now that it is denied, they scheduled me over classes. Which means I now have to get things rescheduled.

4. Non work related, but my Credit Card payment has been returned 4 different times for no reason, even though I had enough money in my account each time I made the payment. It just keeps getting bounced and it is going to mess up my Credit Score even though I have the money!

5. My partner's Mother is moving in with us. I love her dearly, but she speaks no English and this was a sudden change. It is just very stressful and something that popped up out of nowhere and is taking a lot of time and energy to get ready for.

6. On top of all of this, I am trying to start a small business that is taking up some personal time, and while I am having fun with it, it is becoming more and more stressful to keep up with everything as it is. It is starting to fall to the side, which is not good because I am just about to start selling things, but now I may have to push that back because of how things are going.

It all just sucks. Nothing is going good right now, and to be honest, I could do without the stress. Like, very easily."	ectoscreen	post	20.987787076518252	male	White	0.9994921684265137	na	na	na	2	offmychest	no prediction.

"I've thoroughly planned an event for myself and a friend (it's similar to a market). I know my friend well, I knew that I should handle all the planning in order to make sure things get done. I was SO certain that if we split responsibilities they would not get their share done due to being overwhelmed or poor time management.

So I went out of my way to take everything on on my own. My friend only had to do one errand for us. So now that I have handled everything, and it's their turn to take care of their one errand, suddenly its, ""I don't want to do this, I'll try and get it done later.""

On top of that, when I asked if they could try to make sure things were solid, they doubled down and said they could get it done ""if \[I'm\] so worried about it."" Which I dont know how Im not supposed to read that as not passive aggressive. Even if they say it was not at a later time, I can imagine it was supposed to be.

And yes, I am worried about it. I have said time and time again that I want things to be done early so we're not scrambling at the event to get things sorted out.

This was their one responsibility. And they're being incredibly fussy with it. I don't want to fight with my friend but I feel it coming. I feel the excuses of ""I was tired and irritable."" As if we are not adults and can't regulate our emotions. If they KNOW they get irritable, is it not unreasonable to expect them to exercise some restraint?

And again, they agreed to do this errand run, and then backed down. All I asked was for some concrete reassurance that it would get done, and then recieved a passive aggressive response.

I can't believe this, they know they get mad and irritable really quick, and have expressed before that they want to work on this negative trait. But that was expressed almost a year ago and nothing seems to have come of it.

I spent this entire time managing my emotions and tiptoeing around their feelings only to be treated poorly."	disposable2393	post	30.45927586161541	female	White	0.9994230270385742	na	na	na	2	offmychest	no prediction.

"Since I was in high school I kind of just determined fun as escaping my parents grasp, partying, hanging out with friends, doing reckless stuff, etc. In my junior year of college though, I kind of went off the deep end. Instead of going out and partying with my friends, I would go out on my own and I kind of got myself into a lot of not great situations. It even got to a point where the times that I would go out with friends, they would leave me alone in pursuit of whatever peaked their interest. I would stay out so late at night and the line between safe and sorry was extremely blurred.

I went from staying close to friends in high school to desperately trying to escape their supervision and go off on my own. I think my intentions were right, but I always felt this feeling of them trying to control me just like everyone else. Sometimes it may have been for my own good, other times it seemed like it was just done to hinder me. I think they became the only buffer after awhile of me destroying myself and going off the deep end, and being somewhat regulated and safe. Now I see that is codependency and bred into me since childhood.

 I’m just now coming to terms with my life and my decisions at 25, and it’s in part due to the absolute chaos and havoc I’ve reeked upon myself and the last few people that stayed in my life up until this point. I’ve taken some really hard hits since I graduated college. I made an impulsive decision to move across the country 30 hours away from my family, again as an attempt to rebel. Would have been great if not for the financial repercussions and the fact that I have literally no skills besides pure survival to navigate a lot of situations. It was cool and fun and I was taking the hits with stride until the worst hit came in the start of 2022 when I got fired from my job. I made a painstaking error at my job because I was so wired and barely holding on, which caused my termination. It has taken me a long time to get myself back up on my feet again from that in many ways. It shook my foundation financially, mentally, emotionally, and within my last relationships. It made me realize nothing I had built was actually sturdy at all. I feel like I am finally making my way up for air after drowning for over a year. I don’t want to take the victim mindset but what I went through was very hard. And the people around me made it even harder, as they wanted to take that time to get out all of their grievances towards me, past and present. I wanted to die and no one was there. 

It took a lot of the gentlesness and lightheartedness out of me, and shortly I became what seemed like a monster. My eyes were bloodshot all the time and I was also coming out of a period of time where I was coping with alcohol. It was no longer fun like it was in high school, and just a method of self destruction. But even getting rid of alcohol, I was still using other destructive habits. I was having unprotected sex with random guys, anyone who would show me kindness and validation. I couldn’t go a day without p*rn or masturb*ting. It was always a way I soothed myself in childhood from an early age. I was kind of a monster, but I had no one to turn to that wouldn’t kick me and make it worse. I realized just today that I haven’t felt a childlike joy since I was in high school, before I started dating guys, partying and drinking with friends. Before then, it was just genuine enjoyment of life. I have been punished through every step of becoming an adult and making mistakes, and it took me losing it all to realize."

"Please tell me if this question is irrelevant to the sub, it's just that this is the most fitting sub I've found. So, I've masturbated for some years. I constrict myself to softcore porn because it's my preference and I currently don't do hardcore and kind of want to keep it that way. To keep it controlled I do it twice a week in the weekends. First day with material, and second in the shower because I try to abstain from softcore as well, since It kind of still feels ""wrong"" (post-nut, which I feel is partly caused by the discouragement and advice to quit porn entirely on the internet). 

However, I've noticed a pattern: During pre-deed, the longer that the time has passed since last, I feel like I become what I can try to describe as a combination of less concentrated and productive (maybe, just maybe less confident. I'm unsure). Post-deed, I kind of feel relaxed and get a sort of productivity-boost that helps me with finishing things like homework. (I don't know if it's just a coincidence, but on the first day, I usually stay up late cause of no school, and when I end up doing the deed, it calm my nerves and puts me at ease before I go to bed in addition to making me want to go sleep more than I do pre-deed.)

I don't surely know if the ""side effect"" is just me, or if it's common, and I've been in a dilemma whether it's worth it and if the side effects of abstaining can affect me.

I feel like my masterbation routine is tied to looking at porn. When I masterbate, I mainly look at porn. So to keep it under control, and more rewarding, I do it only two times. For your second question: I first began masterbating, later began softcore (you know the deal, first discovery) To put it in a way, I was masterbating less frequently without softcore, as my hormones were calmer. It's kind of given me a hormone spike, if you can say it that way.	Agile_Yak2171	follow-up	na	na	na	0.0014373095473274589	no	strong	no	na	offmychest	failed
"My daughter (15F) lives at boarding school in Center London, she sleeps with her window open so she’s very used to city noises. She comes home every summer however, My wife and I live in a very remote village and it’s dead silent at night, my daughter needs those noises to sleep so she just plays a city noise background on her tv. Her room is also the room all the pipes are and it’s pretty hot in there so she always sleeps with her window open.

I know for a fact she always keeps her TV volume low to avoid neighbours being disturbed but last Sunday (at 7am) the next door neighbour (Rachel) knocked on our door and complained for about 20 minutes about how loud it is and that she can’t get any sleep at night (the irony of this situation is she tends to argue with her husband very loudly in the middle of the night). My daughter apologised and said she would turn down the volume down. 

My daughter decided to not to have the TV on on Sunday night and slept terribly, then on Monday night she started listening to it via her headphones, but they kept falling out and she would wake up every time they did and she kept doing this all week. 

On Friday my daughter wanted to use the TV again, just at a lower volume. I really didn’t think this was a big deal since it’s only 2 weeks until she goes back to school, however on Saturday, Rachel sent my wife this message:

“It’s 1am in the morning and I can’t sleep because of your daughters tv, if this doesn’t stop I’ll bring it up with the parish council”.

My daughter has the tv on a timer so every hour it’ll pause, to avoid it playing all night. Also thought I’d add I’m a member of the parish council so not really sure what she thought she was doing there haha. 

I didn’t show my daughter this message but I did tell her that she can have the TV on for as long as she wants, I also checked with some other neighbours and none of them had even heard it. Rachel kept harassing both my wife and I’s messages, she’s also filed a formal complaint to the parish council. I don’t think my daughter - or myself- is in the wrong here. What do you think?"

"Rachel sounds awful - tell her to ""*shut the fuck up*"".

Night time noise complaints tend to need to be after 2300 Hrs, persistent, and above 34 dBA (decibels adjusted) where background noise is no higher than 24dBA (10dBA above the level of background noise if this exceeds 24dBA) before the local authority will do anything.

"This is for that certain guy that I can't get off my mind. 

*I'm beginning to learn what real love is, and one of the things that I'm learning, is that there is a difference between holding on and fighting for love and knowing when to let go. Because the universe sees fit not to bring you back to me, I'm taking the hint to mean that I should let you go.* 

*I'm not doing this out of hatred, bitterness, fear, selfishness, anger, or resentment. I'm doing this because I love you. I meant it when I said that I want good things for you and I want what's best for you. I would be doing you a huge disservice if I kept up that tug-of-war with the universe, trying to readjust things and wanting to go back into the past to make things right so we could eventually be together. It would be wrong if I wanted you for myself because I wanted you. If I did, I know that you would not end up being happy with me. You would be miserable. You would be hindered and prevented from living your best life. You would eventually come to resent me. I don't want that for you. I want you to be happy. I want you to live your best life. I want you to have what is best. Even if that means enjoying those things without me.* 

*Now, I'm not discounting the possibility that the universe could change course and bring you back. There could be a real chance that I may very well see you and again and we can give things a real try. At the same time, I'm not going to stake the rest of my life upon that. It's something that I'm just going to have to see to believe.* 

*My letting you go does not mean that you will leave my memory. It doesn't mean that I'm ever going to forget you. It doesn't mean that I hate you, or that I hold anything against you, or that you are obligated to me in any way. You are always going to be on my mind, at least as far as I can tell.* 

*For myself, the next stage of my healing is acceptance. I accept that you're not coming back. I accept that you're on the wrong side of ""right person, wrong time"". I accept that, no matter how much I wish I could change things from the past, it would not have worked out. I accept that, if the universe saw fit for the both of us to have a real chance, then you would have the open door to pursue that alongside me. I accept your silence in my life and my eternal curiosity over how your life might be going. I accept that your season, your brief purpose in my life, has ended and it's my responsibility to take my healing and growth to the next level. I accept that you were never meant to be permanent. Yes, I accept all that and more.* 

*As for the future, that truly remains to be seen. For right now, and as far as I can tell into the foreseeable future, it's right and proper for me to release you and to truly let you go.* 

*I love you.*

As you can tell by the title I have made mistakes on online chat rooms. I would frequently make use of these chat rooms to masturbate. I started engaging in this risky sexual behavior after I graduated hs. At first I was looking to masturbate with people my own age. However I became so addicted to these chat rooms that I started saying inappropriate things to minors. One day I was masturbating and up came another female touching her private. I asked to see more then realized this person was young. I asked the age and she said 12. I left immediately. It has been 5 months since this transpired and I realized now I have to make a change. I can not go deeper into this sexual addiction. I need a supportive community before it gets out of control.

"I am tired of seeing dating shows for people with disabilities (autism, down syndrome, etc.) and although I am all for advocating that people with various health conditions and impairments can enjoy similar (if the not the same) pleasures as what one would call “able-bodied”, but this is just straight exploitation and misinformation at times. 

I dislike how they overdramatize things unnecessarily, or how they twist things to their own narrative at times to sell a “product”. it feels dehumanizing at times, and also spreads misinformation. dating on the spectrum (from what i have seen) doesn’t really portray how many autistic people GENUINELY express their sexualities and romantic interests, and it feels almost like mockery. I saw people making fun of those shows when i used more social media, so I feel like others view it that way too maybe. 

I could be wrong and overthinking, but I just hate any show/program that profits off of dehumanizing people and filming in depth interactions, 100% not healthy and i dislike how media has become more of that.

For the whole of my life years, I never ever gave a  thought to my sexuality and always thought I was straight. And I don't even believe or support the whole LGBTQ+ community thing (I respect different beliefs and communities tho. I don't want to be lectured here) 

However, I just noticed that for the longest I can remember, I loved looking at women bodies (i am a female myself). Like if I got to choose between seeing a man naked and a woman naked, I'd most definitely choose the woman. I hate seeing naked men or their private areas, yet I still get attracted to men in general, I'd marry a man and would sleep with a man. 

It's just so confusing to me, and I'm second-guessing myself again. Am I something thing other than straight? Like is it normal to be attracted to women bodies and be straight? 

I guess I just need advice on that from different perspectives cuz I myself don't support that as I said before, and it would be painfully ironic if i happened to discover sth else about myself.

"How am I supposed to open up my heart and grow when I'm so deeply jealous of everyone?

Lately, I've been wrestling with something that is so incredibly painful– how to embrace our own lives and find growth, even when surrounded by the success of those close to us when our own lives are in turmoil.

It's not easy, I admit. Watching my inner circle achieve what seems beyond reach can be tough. Their rapid progress and life-altering transformations can leave me feeling stuck and left behind. Take my boyfriend's recent contest victory, for instance. Out of countless contestants, he won, filling me with a bittersweet mix of pride and jealousy.

He seems to have it all – an enviable job, a supportive tribe of friends, a family that stands by him, and even strides toward better health. Meanwhile, I find myself grappling with starting over, drowning in debt, and wrestling with the loss of health insurance. Finishing school feels like a distant dream, shadowed by a growing sense of apathy. I've been asking myself, ""What's the point?"" Whats the point of having friends or a boyfriend that have it all when you have nothing? I have nothing to share besides pure jealousy. I don't want to be like this but I end up feeling this way anyway.

Jealousy is gnawing at me as I see others stepping into their dream lives. I've shed tears, hoping they might wash away my pain, but the ache persists. So, where do I go from here? How can I grow amid this discomfort? Because whatever I do I can't help but feel like I'm being left behind in every aspect of my life. One thing I'm learning is that growth doesn't come from pretending to be happy for others.

I remind myself that I hold the key to my own salvation. No external force will magically fix things. This journey is mine to navigate yet I feel so apathetic about life i've ghosted everyone in my life and have just been rotting in my room."

"First of all, I want to acknowledge your courage in opening up about your feelings and seeking help. That’s a big step, and it shows that you have some hope and motivation to change. You don’t have to suffer in silence or isolate yourself from others. There are people who care about you and want to support you, including your boyfriend, your friends, and me.

Secondly, I want to remind you that your worth is not defined by your achievements or your circumstances. You are a valuable and unique person, regardless of what you do or have. You have strengths, talents, passions, and dreams that make you who you are. You also have challenges, struggles, fears, and doubts that make you human. You don’t have to compare yourself to others or feel inferior to them. You can celebrate their success without diminishing your own.

Thirdly, I want to encourage you to challenge your negative thoughts and beliefs that fuel your jealousy and low self-esteem. You may be telling yourself things like “I have nothing”, “I’m a failure”, “I’m being left behind”, or “I don’t deserve anything better”. These are not facts, but opinions that can be changed. You can use cognitive behavioral therapy techniques to identify and replace these thoughts with more positive and realistic ones"	Able_Macaron_8464	reply	na	na	na	0.17043238878250122	weak	no	no	na	offmychest	failed
"I can offer some thoughts to consider:


The fourth paragraph, the one the starts with ""he seems"" gives a list of results attained (the bfs) or not attained (yours). That paragraph reads in a way that puts more of a focus on results as a temporal state of being rather than the  process/work that produced them.

Focusing on what someone has/I don't have easily leaves room for jealousy. Focussing on what I want and committing planning, time, perseverance and work leaves almost no room for jealousy. The jealousy and emphasis on how it feels could not really be a problem as much as it is a reflection on focus and work ethic.

That is a thought to consider as I do not know how well it applies to your situation."	Able_Macaron_8464	reply	na	na	na	0.17043238878250122	no	no	no	na	offmychest	failed
"Hey everybody. I am so sorry for this post, it's super heavy. I hope you all don't mind me venting.

Obviously tw sh

To put it in extremely short for you guys (as much as I can) , and for me because I don't wanna re trigger myself, my dad has been emotionally absent and therefore emotionally neglectful my whole life. To sum him up in about four words, he is an easily angered, avoidant, most likely mentally ill himself and arrogant person. He thinks he's right and only his view matters. He definitely was abused himself, his mom made effort to abuse the sensitiveness out of him because he was 'too soft', which I think he's not wanting to work through it. I know deep down he's scared, bit as a result, he cannot be stable himself, is emotionally abusive and is a contributer to the situation I'm about to describe. My mom is a narcissistic alcoholic, who I no longer see, and haven't since I was 13. She was physically neglectful, abusive, just everything. I have some posts about her if you wanted more background.

I was feeling alone already. Suicidal. I just needed love, and my dad decided to pick on me for spending some, not all, of my 18th birthday money on a guitar on Friday. I've always wanted to play. But, when he saw  I bought it, he flipped out at me. Said I was ungrateful, and careless with money. I tried to explain why I'd made the investment, as my depression has been getting worse and he has been saying how I never help myself or do anything. So I thought, investing in a hobby would be the good option, baring in mind I barely have energy to wake up; being alive, it's just so hard, so it's a big thing for me to even entertain the thought genuinely let alone actively putting energy into it. 

He then said how I may as well 'kill the old bugger' meaning him (he's 53), and a comment he has been making for a while, that 'you're not the one who needs antidepressants, I'll be needing them more than you at this rate'. I got upset at this, but didn't show it, and went upstairs to try and calm down. Because he's saying my depression, me being miserable, is what is causing all the problems, and that I just do these things to myself. 

Long ass story short he really ripped into me, and said that I was a selfish person, didn't care for anybody but myself and that I am the reason he can't sleep at night, because he 'has to look at my miserable face'. He then made me look in the mirror and said for me to look at myself, who would want to be with me? When I'm so horrible to look at and depressing. I said to him that I was really hurt by his comments and that I was trying my hardest, and I'd appreciate if he said he was proud of me every once in a while. He then screamed at me, said ""well, what is there to be proud of? And anyway I do, when you got that job. (it's only when it's things like that, things that have value to him: grades and employment, keeping a good attitude). You don't do anything, I look around and I don't see anything to be proud of. I mean just look at your room."" and then ranted about how I don't hoover and clean the house enough (I hoover and mop most weeks, do the washing up most days, after myself AND him, offer to do the washing of clothes etc, take the bins out.) and he thinks that I have to do everything because he has to work, and suffers more than me - which he still said when I was working full time, 30 hours a week, but because he works 40 or maybe 45 in a week if he does overtime, I still don't have it as bad and was still expected to be happy all the time, and do everything without complaint). 

I got into a panic. And he left swearing and just. Lost it. And I couldn't cope anymore so I took the decision to phone my crisis team. They didn't help, and said I was basically overreacting and 'well you argue with your dad all the time, just talk to him i am sure he'll understand.' I tried to tell them this was a result of me trying to talk to him. But they weren't listening. I told them I was really suicidal and just wanted this all to stop, for someone to listen to me. I felt and feel I'm going crazy. 

 I tried and tried to get the crisis worker to hear me, but they wouldn't change their ground and even when I said I couldn't cope anymore, they weren't even listening/registering to that as extreme crisis, so I then said I wanted to commit suicide because I desperately needed the pain to stop. I said this, and they said 'I don't understand what you're getting in such a fuss about. An argument with your dad? We all argue with our parents'. It was that, that, made me snap. I screamed 'you don't care. You don't understand and never fucking will.' and put the phone down. And started cutting on my wrists. They tried to phone me back, which I declined, and when they tried again a minute or so later, I answered and they said for me to write the adult crisis team number down. (I have only just turned 18, so I'm still technically under children's mental health services), yet they refused to treat me despite still being under the service and in obvious crisis, because I was 18. I said I couldn't write it down, and was repeatedly told I needed to and why couldn't I just pick up a pen and write it and phone them? I then said what I did. And they said they were going to phone my dad. Next thing I know they're begging me to open the door where my dad is stood outside. I did, and he looks livid. Absolutely livid. Before I get a word in, he notices I had been balling my eyes out (couldn't see my bleeding arm as I'd hid it behind the door) and he angrily said 'I may as well go then shall I?' and he left me there. I screamed ""fine. I don't need you anyway. Just go"", slammed the door, all while the crisis team were still on the phone. And cut more. Eventually they told me to go down to my dad and show him my arm. I did, reluctantly, still crying and he got more angered, and didn't care. Told me to get tissue and sort myself out while the crisis team said to check if I was severe enough for AnE. He didn't help at all, just looked at me, while my arm was BLEEDING OUT and he said 'they're just scratches she's fine'. But then he said, but I'll take her to AnE anyway. He did, didn't speak to me at all there, was mad, and was getting calls from the family asking what was happening. They all called him, checked on him... None checked on me :(

After all that, my dad hasn't asked me if I'm okay. No one has. I can't stop hurting myself because I really really don't want to be here anymore.

I keep coming really close to taking my life again, and yes I have been using helplines to try and get through the day, so yes, I have SOMEONE. but it's the consistent someone I need. Not having to explain my story time and time again to different people, and everything. It's just too much. Way way too exhausting. She understands me (my therapist). Wants to help me. And I just want to hug her and never let go. But we're ending really soon because I'm 18.

I needed to get this off my chest. I really really did. I really hope someone hears me. I just need someone to hold me safely and love me genuinely."	musiclover255	post	25.909857541763365	female	White	0.9976822137832642	na	na	na	2	offmychest	ethnicity: no prediction, age: 18, gender: female, explanation: the author just turned 18 and is in transition from a children's mental health service to adult mental health service. the writing style and mentions of parents suggest a younger age. there is no definitive indication to make an inference about the person's ethnicity. the author references a father and mother but does not mention her own gender explicitly however, the overall tone and context suggest that the author identifies as female.
"Shit mate idk. The only reason I ain't probably in the same emotional boat as you is cause I have baby brothers to take care if. They are kinda my everything, my parents are... well the.less I speak if them the better. I know what's it is like to have an emotionally abusive parent, it hurts even more when you actually want their love and appreciation, even though you know they have fucked you up emotionally. Though I do understand you being empathetic to your dad as he has his own scars, but that still doesn't forgive his attitude towards you. I'm so sorry you in this situation. 

I dont know if this will help but try explaining to him you know he has his own shit hes going through and although you love him, you dont think he loves you, you want to feel safe with him and be his daughter and for him to be your father. You want to be a family because this is just harmful to both of you. That getting insulted by him hurts probably even more than others. And perhaps take it from there if it goes well enough... though I'm not sure how well he will take it, many ppl dont really know how bad they fuck up until their loved ones tell then in a calm situation, outside of drama and arguments.

"Worst decision I made this year. 

Started off as a 3 month situationship. He took me on dates and we did couples things minus the label

3 months in, I asking him “where is this going?” You’re a sweet guy but sometimes you make me feel bad about myself (ex. He likes blondes and I’m latina, would make comments on my family’s lower income than his)

He said he didn’t feel a spark, understandable. Hurts though because 3 months of sex and couples things, he wanted to be FWB tho, and I thought I could handle it

3 months of FWB (6 months total) he met a girl, this girl is everything I want to be. Two loving parents, big house, parents bought her car and college and it broke me.

Before we parted ways I gave him advice on how to be a better partner, their dating now. He promised me he would do better.

It just hurts knowing he had to treat one girl bad in order to treat another one better.

His red flags:
• 11 bodies, were teenagers/young adults
• ^ I’m not shaming anyone’s past for their bodies, but maybe commitment issues?
• “your car is a POS” “if you had a neighborhood pool it’d be ghetto” 
• pointed out this blonde girl, told me that was his “type” and he can’t help it for having a type
• used to vape in his dogs face
• literally had a girl two weeks before me
• has a lot of exes he never dated
• told me he usually leaves the girl, and usually finds something annoying

I want to heal. It’s been two months of no contact (we don’t hate each other, I’m not going to talk to him if he has a girlfriend tho) I feel depressed at times. I told him my biggest fear was getting used for my body, sometimes i feel like even in our talking phase he was just using me for the deed

OH YEAH and the last time we hung out, my car was having problems, he told me he would drive if I bought him dinner"	Tiara49	post	21.71120563733494	female	White	0.9992198944091797	na	na	na	3	offmychest	ethnicity: hispanic/latina, age: late teens-early 20s, gender: female, explanation: the author identifies as latina and mentions that they are in a phase of life where they are dating, which often refers to late teens or early 20s. the experiences recounted are typically associated with female gender.

"I (27M) and romantically involved with a girl from back home (22F). She has a boyfriend. 

We met through a mutual friend over social media. That friend has been trying to set me up with girls left and right so I'll settle down and move back home. At first I thought this girl was a scam account because she was absolutely gorgeous and I'm like a 6/10 lol. Anyway, we start chatting and it took off from there. We've talked every single day since then. Eventually it progressed into video chatting every night too.

It wasn't until about 3-4 weeks into it before she told me that the ""ex"" she told me about, well they're still together. Albeit, they don't live with eachother and not in the best shape romantically.  At this point, I didn't care. I was already in love with her. It hasn't been easy, knowing that she has a bf and they're still ""together"" but I put up with it because I love her. A month or so ago, she went on a family vacation and we barely talked. When she came back, things were off and I asked her about it. She said that she felt guilty and didn't know what to do because she loved me and wants me in her life but she didn't necessarily want to leave this dude yet. We agreed to dial things back but keep talking.

That didn't last, within a week we were right back where we were. 

We talk about of future and all the things we want to do together (I even joke about marrying her and having kids) and it's wonderful. But she isn't showing any signs of leaving this guy. She says ""when it's time, it's time"" and that she wants it to be a mutual breakup. But this dude genuinely has no idea that I exist or that they're having any REAL problems. Oh, and he started living with her again, but they barely see eachother because he works nights. 

I go back home tomorrow to see family, but all I can think about is her, and spending time with her. I want her to leave him so we don't have to sneak around when I'm home. I always tell her that I'm hers and she says that she's mine, but that just isn't true. 

I know the smart thing would be to end things and when she's ready we can pick things back up. But I can't imagine my life without her at this point? Just the though of closing that door breaks my heart. But I don't know what I'm doing and I don't have anyone to talk to about it.

Then yesterday when she stopped responding to my texts her brother texted me. She was raped multiple times, I was so shocked and scared for her. I just wanted to be with her but I couldn't. I kept texting her and texting her until we responded, I tried to calm her down but im not an expert. We talked for a while before she went to bed, Then I went to my friend to ask what I should do. We talked for a little bit, and then he said ""You should block her, on everything. She is putting way to much stress on you and you would be better off just blocking her."" I hung up the phone immediately. I wanted to believe there is another way but I cant do anything to help her since its long distance. When I was younger I always said to myself that if that happened I would kill them. But im not angry, im just sad that she had to go through that.

I will cut to the chase .She ask me to touch her ( you know where).And I did it,I was a stupid kid.I know.
From then on I thought it was normal so when I was 6 me and my friends touched each other in the same way.We used to touch each other in our school bus.Yet we never got caught. 
Fast-forward to a few years later. The same thing happen. Except much worse. It was my sister. She was 12 and I was 8.Same thing as the maid thought this time it went on for 2.5 years.

I would pursue the degree if you think it’s something you really want to do and would make you happy. Apply for financial aid and as many scholarships as possible.

"I'm so tired of things going wrong... I'm so sick of struggling all the damn time...

My son has an accessory navicular that is hurting him so bad he cant walk for more than a few minutes. He's only 14... He just started high school and already missed a day due to foot pain. We have an ortho appointment on thursday. But that's only the first appointment... Who knows what THATS going to cost us... He does have state insurance so hopefully it will be all taken care of.

Our family dog had to be put down yesterday after an accident that broke her back. Totally random and out of left field. Lost our dog of 12 years. We are all broken over this. But we had to borrow 200 dollars for that.

I just had to replace the battery in my car. Had to borrow 150 dollars for that. But it's our only car and i have to get to work...

Im behind on my only credit card and they keep calling asking for a payment...

My electric bill is 600 dollars this month...i only run my AC at 80 degrees... I don't set it lower. And NOW i owe southern California Edison roughly 5500 dollars. But im making 400 dollar payments every month so they dont shut me off.

My rent got raised this year. Now i owe 2265 every month... For a crappy 3 bedroom with no insulation to really speak of. So we are just roasting in our house all day.

My faucet in the bathroom is leaking and i cant get my landlord to pay for it. There is a repair clause that states any repair less than 300 dollars we are responsible for. I cant afford that, so i pretend not to notice....

My wife is at home for one day of bereavement from our dog passing away. She did a load of laundry and discovered our clothes dryer is broken. My 14 year old has an unknown bladder problem that leads him to pee his bed a couple times a week... I cant even provide him with clean fucking bed sheets now.... What the fuck do i do...

I have only a hundred dollars in my account until the 25th. I don't even know how the fuck im going to get groceries let alone gas. I have two kids that deserve so much better than this...

I don't qualify for any type of assistance at all because we are middle class at 70k a year.

My wife home with our son sobbing because after everything else the fucking dryer is fucking broken.... 

I have my own subset of health problems starting that i cant even get looked at because i cant afford the co pay. Strange spots on my skin that look bad. I have had diarrhea for over a year now for no discernable reason, a busted tooth that stops me from eating crunchy or tough food...

Why have fucking insurance of i cant use it?!

And thats not even all of it... I don't know what the fuck to do anymore... The only solution i see is either winning the lottery or having some distant rich relative die and leave me a fortune.

I work in a hospital helping doctors diagnose cancer. My wife works in a biotech lab startup that is wobbly at best. But she makes more money than i do.

All these people we are surrounded by make 5 or 10 times more than we do. Its mentally exausting to hear them talk about thier egyptian vacation coming up. Or this horse they are going to buy... Im over here eating cup of noodles for lunch today because i have no other choices....

"I broke up with my ex for good in early 2019 and was single until last summer. I've been in a healthy relationship for over a year with an amazing man who I love so much. It's made me reflect on my past relationship and I feel like it has unearthed some ""trauma"" so to speak. I feel like nothing I went through was bad enough to be considered abusive though. I don't want to call myself a victim when other people have had it much worse.

My boyfriend is always super apologetic if he accidentally hits me in some way (not literally hitting but like bumping his hand into my face or something like that on accident). It brought up memories of how when I started dating my ex how he would grab my fingers and twist them until they really hurt. He thought it was funny and would never apologize. I always had bruises all over my body, he never punched me or anything but would poke/jab at my body really hard. 

The main thing that has been on my mind is the last time I had sex with my ex. I had tried breaking up with him before this, but he guilted me into staying. That night I repeatedly told him I didn't want to have sex. We hadn't in a while because I didn't feel attracted to him anymore and he started making remarks like, ""are you asexual or something?"" After telling him no, he seemed angry and I felt really scared. There was a thought in the back of my mind that he might kill me so I just went along with it. I remember very vividly laying on my back with my eyes open and feeling completely numb. There wasn't even a tiny bit of pleasure and the whole time I felt sick to my stomach. At one point he put his hands on my neck and I wondered if he would just kill me in that moment and I wouldn't be able to do anything. Afterwards, I went to the bathroom and I was bleeding. I'm a giant crybaby, but I felt nothing. I felt somewhat disgusted with myself for allowing it all to happen. I shut all of it out and it wasn't until my current relationship that it all came out again. I know it's the bare minimum, but my current boyfriend is very caring towards me during sex. He'll instantly stop if he thinks something is wrong or when I tell him to. One time I didn't tell him that I was sore and wanted to stop (he had no idea) and all of a sudden I was hit with the same feeling I had years ago. 

The last thing is something I knew wasn't normal at the time, but did nothing about. If I got sad/depressed or upset in any way he would turn it around on me, saying I hated him. This got to the point where he would bite himself, punch walls, and often grab a knife and threaten to kill himself. I realized this is the reason why I'm scared of knives now and it freaks me out in the kitchen when people hold them.  I always tell my family to be careful and I fear someone will get hurt. 

I needed to get this off my chest because I've never told anyone this in detail. I've mentioned bits and pieces to my boyfriend and my closest friend, but I've never fully put it all out there. I know it's not that bad compared to what other people have been through, but this is my story."

"I’m so sorry for what you went through. My past relationship was also abusive… and now I’m also with a man who loves and cares about me so much and made me realize how badly I had been treated in my previous relationship. I was so scared to leave my previous relationship… it felt like I was under his control. It was horrible, and I’m still trying to process it and deal with the trauma.

You shouldn’t invalidate yourself. What you went through was traumatic, and it’s valid for you to feel that way. Comparing your past experience to other people’s experiences and won’t make you feel better. I know it’s really hard, but remember that you are in a much better place now, you are safe and protected, and you are getting the love that you deserve. It’s a hard process, but I know that you will get through it because you deserve to be loved and be happy."

For the past 5 years i’ve not been my best, i’ve suffered from bad mental health issues when i was 13 so bad as to the point i had to leave school and i became house bound and was put on antidepressants. Since then i’ve gotten a lot better in regard to my mental health issues but 2 years ago i was diagnosed with a chronic health condition and since then it’s been a rollercoaster of illness. I go from being well while on a certain medication and then ill again and it can be for months when they won’t treat me. Every time things are going well in my life something goes wrong whether it’s physical, mental or something else and that’s why i can never transform my life fully and live the way i want to, i’m 18 and i have hardly any life experiences and i don’t feel like an adult, but part of me just thinks what’s the point of putting hard work in to change when it all comes crumbling down around me in the end anyway. I don’t think i can take the disappointment of trying to make a life for it to not work and then me being in stage 1 all over again.

"Am I the only one who feels this way? We're a big family, I have 7 older siblings and one sister younger than me (total of 9). I'm not saying what I'm about to say out of arrogance or anything but I've always felt bad for some of my siblings for trying so hard yet not getting what they want, when I feel like I can get the same thing easily just because I'm younger or smarter or whatever reason?
It just makes me feel horrible whenever I succeed or get high grades or win in anything, it makes me think they'll get jealous the same way I would if I see someone doing better than me. 
I know jealousy is normal to a certain extent, and jealousy stems from a feeling that you want what that person whom you're jealous of has, and acknowledging this will make me understand myself and what I desire more, yet I cant stand the idea of knowing that one of my siblings might feel jealous of me because of something I did or got or won or whatever.
I'm not even sure if I'm describing what I feel the right way.. but there's some depressing feeling that eats me from the inside when I think about this and about one particular sister of mine."	tokyoclup	post	8.303596654449544	female	White	0.9968141913414001	na	na	na	1	offmychest	no prediction.
"You are not a bad person, don’t panic okey? Don’t beat yourself too much.

your siblings are fine, in life we don’t always get what we want. 

You are confident with yourself and that’s good, and while writing this you might have overlooked traits or forgot moments you didn’t get what you wanted, and underestimated who your sibling is , or could be.

So when they have a hard time, you just remember all your good times and compare it and think that they might feel angry / jealous or a feeling of \*unfair\*. Because you think that if you were them that’s what would you have felt. 

but your sibling is also good at things that you might not be, siblings are rarely the same, they don’t excel in the same thing, not all of them fail at the same thing, etc etc.

they will have their time of success , and ull have ur time too, it’s not a competition.

sometimes itll seem like ur ahead, sometimes it’ll look like they are.

it’s how life is, we should just focus on putting our best and be sincere with ourselves. And be satisfied in where we are.

and see how I said ”seem” . When we look at ourselves and people we sort of make a ranking or divide it into categories of ok this person is ahead of me, ok this person is beneath me when in reality it’s all wrong, not everyone is in the same timeline. it rlly depends on so many things. Even the meaning of success is different to so many people.

today u can have it all and lose it, same thing can happen in reverse. The human condition is always changing so keep one thing constant : \*contentment and gratefulness\*. 

that way you’ll be able to go through all those seasons and will be able to watch your sibling go through their diff seasons as well.

ur only competitor is yourself only, don’t pity your siblings, you both are equal in different ways. Perhaps there is a different way that’ll work for them, believe in them.

funny thing is , many of the times when we r at that age , siblings view each other that way we just \*feeling bad\* for the other , so ur not weird dw it’s just a sibling thing, but ig when one gets older and life circumstances r soon to be over or u learn more about them , ull realize how ur siblings r amazing and they’ll realize that too about u."	tokyoclup	reply	na	na	na	0.9968141913414001	weak	no	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.
"This year has been bad. So bad that I have made serious plans for killing myself nearly 6 times, and every time I just sort of procrastinate to the next time I fail. The most recent time was when I was supposed to be getting my A-level result. I was going to go through with it if I got anything lower than a B.

I know this sounds like a massive exaggeration. B's aren't bad. But they were not what my dad deserved after all he's done for my education. In my mind, I felt compelled to kill myself so I wouldn't be that kind of burden to my family. Sort of like how samurai used to commit honor suicides. I didn't want to die, but the only compensation I could offer for the shame of my failure was to not exist.

Anyways my result came out good, so for now I didn't have to kill myself. 

But now it's really started to feel like a cycle of living from the fear of one failure to the next. I don't know how to get out. I don't even know if I want to get out because I keep feeling like this misery and unhappiness is just compensation for the times I have been happy. Mid 2021- mid 2022 was like the happiest point in my life, and I feel like I've been paying for it ever since. I cannot enjoy the good parts of life because I feel like I can literally see the bad ones from the corner of my eye. 

I mean I can only cast like 20% of the blame on my parents because ever since I was young they have found a way to taint happy moments like birthdays or hangouts with friends by usually beating me up for something that went wrong. But then 80% is my fault, because I internalised that good times are always followed by bad times and therefore the converse must be true. So every moment I purposely choose to be miserable by starving myself and bottling things up, having the fucked up hope that some sort of ""God"" will take pity on me and just let me be happy.

I can't tell these things to people, because despite this very miserable confession, I can be a funny and bright person, and that's a persona I don't want to be rid of because I think that's my ideal version of myself. The version I am around others."	what_noflyingcars	post	13.485005685595192	male	White	0.9984526634216309	na	na	na	1	offmychest	no prediction.

Dude....The math ain't matting here. 

Have you ever thought that the pressure you put on your shoulder is a direct result of what happened to you? You just said it: Happy moments always ruined by your parents beating you up for something that went wrong (which is probably something really small/unimportant). But in the end, the bad always outcome the good. 

May be that's why you constantly feel like failure, or a nuisance to others, since you don't have the luxury to make a single mistake.

"As the tile says, I’m on my period so my hormones are all out of wack, which is probably why I feel as emotionally sensitive as I do right now haha. So I woke up this morning with a nasty cold, thick headache, sore throat, high temp, the lot. My girlfriend had work in the morning, i had a shift in the evening. I get off work at 9 and we had agreed that we’d have a films night with snacks in bed. I was really looking forward to it. Before my work I walk into the room we get ready in as it has the best mirror, my girlfriend is straightening her hair and has her makeup bag out and is all dressed up. I ask where’s she’s going. She says that our friend group had messaged her asking if she wants to go to the pub, no biggie, she says she’ll be back well before i finish work (as it’s about 4pm, she says she’ll be back for maybe 6 or 7). I am a little upset that they didn’t ask me, but I don’t drink, i 
 rarely go to the pub but they normally still message me to ask. I say to myself it isn’t a big deal and they didn’t mean anything by it, it just slipped thier mind. Fast forward to now, I’ve just got back. I had a pretty rough shift and was just super exited to get into bed and watch a film. My girlfriend isn’t home, and she’s messaged to say she doesn’t even know when she’s leaving. It so stupid to be as upset as I am, but I can’t help how I feel. I think it’s jus a combo of the cold, bad shift at work and my period really trying my emotions. Anyways that it. Thanks for reading haha, i hope you’re all having a decent night."

Happens to millions everyday. It's the drawback of anonymous communication on those apps. It amplifies peoples inconsiderate behavior and lack of respect to the point where there doesn't even have to be a reason anymore when it comes to online communication. If you're 'lucky' there were such pressing family issues that needed his immediate emotional support, that there wasn't a moment to explain why he wouldn't be able to talk anymore. More likely however, he probably decided to delete you without giving it any real thought to it.

"My wife and I have been married for five years now and together for seven. She is originally from France, but we live in the US now. Thankfully both our jobs are remote and we are able to work while staying here. We’ve been here a week already and planning to stay for four more weeks. We are staying with her family, which is just her mom and younger sister (her dad is out of the picture). 

I get along really well with her mom and sister and I’m so happy to stay with them… but they are very open in the house. By this, I mean they will walk around after showers topless or with nothing on at all. Their clothes are loose and hide very little. When they are home, they do not care about any of this and make themselves comfortable. They tease me a bit about it as I’m American and our views on nudity are quite different than that of the French. 

I try to remain calm and brush it off, but I can’t contain my inner thoughts about this. My wife is stunning, but the good looks run in the family. Her sister is basically her twin and her mom is just an older version of her. It doesn’t help that due to the sleeping arrangements, my wife and I haven’t been able to have any intimacy since arriving here and probably won’t for awhile. 

I don’t want to talk to my wife about this cause I’m a guest in her family’s home, they shouldn’t have to change their ways because of me, but to be blunt, I’m so turned on constantly. Call me a pig, disgusting, whatever you want. I challenge any man to be in this situation and not be going absolutely crazy. 

What can I even do?

Edit: holy damn, I just opened Reddit with over 100 notifications. I simply posted this to distract myself for a bit but there are some pretty funny comments. 

First, for those saying this is fake, I don’t know what to tell you. It’s not like my MIL and SIL and lounging around in the nude and rubbing their boobs in my face. They are simply going from the shower to their room or wearing loose fitting clothes that leave little to the imagination when they bend over or get in certain positions. It’s a lot of quick moments but hard to miss when they happen. 

Second, for those who think I’m creepy and gross need to understand that I’m letting my inner thoughts out on here on a throwaway account and I would never act on any impulses. I’m as respectful as possible to them and I believe their comfort level around me is indicative of that. 

Third, for those who are leaving understanding and empathetic comments, thank you. It’s a funny situation and I appreciate that some can find the humor in all of this."	StinkySquirrelSauce	post	31.247207905197477	male	White	0.0019517934415489435	na	na	na	445	offmychest	failed

So kinda similar experience. I was dating a girl last year for 6 months who was Brazilian. Brazilians tend to wear bikinis that leave very little to the imagination and she was no different. The first few times we went to the beach with my friends or family it didn’t bother me per se but it was awkward as I didn’t want them looking at her like that. After a couple weeks, it stopped bothering me because I would just say “a butts a butt, everyone has one”.

Then I moved to Spain, where women go topless on the beach (and I believe soon in pools), and I remember seeing a lot of people of all ages naked from their balconies. Again, I believe this is a cultural issue. Now, I guess I've accepted and do something similar like your sister in law or mother in law, I go naked in my house. 
But when I moved from Spain to Ireland with my wife (she’s Irish), I observed a significant change in these aspects. I believe Anglo-Saxons have a leaning towards Puritanism, and anything to do with the body is awkward. My wife tells me that I cannot be shirtless if her family comes to visit, and if I am naked and in the living room or walking to fetch a towel, she says, ""Your are naked, people will see you."" 
Again, I believe it is due to cultural differences. To me, these things are perfectly ok because it is their home and they are not acting strangely, such as needing to sit together naked. 
At the end of the day, it is merely bodies, and people should treat them as natural ."	StinkySquirrelSauce	reply	na	na	na	0.0019517934415489435	no	strong	no	na	offmychest	failed

Wait this all got me thinking about clothes and the history of why we cover body parts. What about face masks during COVID-19? Think about how masks cover the nose (a beauty standard) and the mouth (a “sexual/sensual organ”). I wonder if as a species we were to keep wearing masks collectively we would all associate the mouth and nose area as we do with so called private parts? How strange and personal it would be to drop your mask and expose your face? How much more important/sinful kissing would be in society? How are parts of the body even determined to be censorable?

You’re fortunate that freer people are ok with their bodies, because you can now learn to get that way too (of course consult with your wife!). Lots of people will say naturism is not about sex. But if a young guy would rather see a beautiful naked woman than say, roses or sleek architecture or a Van Gogh landscape or a sunset, etc, I’d give odds a brain fMRI would light up in the sex locations. But that’s fine because thoughts and feelings aren’t actions. See how your wife feels, and do as she suggests, including getting used to going nude yourself if she’s ok with that. Don’t stare, hide your boners, and soon enough it’ll be no big deal. I once lived in a house (with other adults). We’d be naked some of the time. Because everyone felt safe, no one worried or gave it a second thought, because being nude is a wonderful feeling. Once I had a boner and one of the women joked, hey are you needing a towel rack?

"Sounds quite normal tbf.

Gives you a good chance to deal with your attitude toward sexuality and review your beliefs around aesthetics and where you draw your lines on beauty and arousal. 

Mature emotional intelligence can distinguish between aesthetics and sex.

It's eg why men are not sitting with erections in the mixed sauna. 

You could do yourself the favour and tell your wife to discuss, because then you can work with it and they will probably want to help you with it.

Being uncomfortable with unsolicited nudity is one thing but to have the hots for her relatives too makes this situation sound… even more uncomfortable.

Regardless, even though you don’t want to upset them by being a guest in the house there are certain boundaries everyone has the right to have, for you it’s not to see them practically nude while you’re staying there. Sure they may tease you in the beginning if you tell them (Many European cultures love doing that) but if you stay adamant on your boundaries and letting them know what is right and wrong for you then you’ll feel more comfortable around them.

I know there’s culture at play here, and I’ve worked in environments where women were naked, but I’ve always found it strange when people don’t consider the visitors in this kind of situation.

It’s not like they’re women that he sees every day and considers to be like his mom and his sister. These are like your cousin’s wife or your uncle’s step-daughter.

"Hey OP I'm someone who's grown up in a similar culture. With my immediate family it's actually super normal for us and we feel no discomfort because we're at home in our own places and I think the biggest difference is a societal and potentially cultural thing.

If we really thought about it, people view ""sexual"" things and ""nude"" things on a spectrum (you could probably graph it) but don't forget there's a *lot* of nuance about it. 

For someone who grows up with all forms of media and parents telling you that nudity is inappropriate and sexual at *all* times, you grow up with that very idea. With my family as an opposing example, nudity at home is whatever. We don't view each other sexually, and we don't necessarily view nudity as inherently sexual, either, because it's about the context of it. Of course dressing up to go outside is completely different.

 I'm sure there's a *lot* more to discuss about the topics of nudity and sexuality and inappropriateness and what we find ""normal"" and it's totally normal for you to feel uncomfortable about it as this isn't something you're used to. I mean, let's face it, how much porn is out there that sexualizes families? On top of that the sexualization of nude bodies in general? There's trying to get used to it and then there's just plain trying to avoid it. You don't have to conform to what they're doing, but you also can't change what they do.

Completely normal to feel this way. In most cases people adjust/ become sensitized to it. I was au pair in France for a family that lived in a nudist community. It was really uncomfortable for me at first and I felt even more weird being the only one with clothing on, but not wanting to be nude either. After awhile it just became mundane, and I too started slowly wearing less clothing.  I never did go completely nude, but that was just due to my comfort in the circumstances. If I had been in the same situation but with friends, I believe I would’ve gone nude as well.	StinkySquirrelSauce	reply	na	na	na	0.0019517934415489435	weak	strong	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.

I think your reaction is normal and I probably would have felt the same way. I've been in a couple relationships where my partners family life was a bit of a culture shock.

I agree, I think you (OP) should bring it up with your wife and explain what's making you uncomfortable.  Also, you say they walk around after showers topless, do you mean around the house generally or to-and-from the bathroom to the bedroom to get changed?  If it's the latter, why are you watching?  Do they know you're watching?  If not, that could be horrifying for them.  Once you realise that they're coming out of the bathroom, you can avert your eyes or be somewhere else.  The same goes for when they bend over, you can clearly tell when it's happening so avert your eyes.

You don’t get it. He was having a natural internal response and he had no outlet so he talked about it instead of indulging in it. My dick gives me bad ideas all the time, it doesn’t mean I’m a bad person. This guy cared about his wife enough to try and make sense of it. We have a drive in us to spread out DNA, so he sees a sister and mother of his wife that he’s obviously attracted to, and his DNA sees that as more opportunity to spread itself, and this creates physical responses and overwhelms thoughts.

"No, it's not. Generally speaking, it's considered inappropriate in the US for members of one's family to not be fully clothed around them. It is usually seen as okay for male family members to go shirtless, but only in specific appropriate contexts, like if they are mowing the lawn or exercising. Also, many people are comfortable changing clothes in front of same sex siblings. Some people will change in front of close friends, but it is usually expected that people turn around or not look in the direction of each other when that happens. Partners of course do not have any reservations about being partially or completely naked around each other.

In the US, you never see another person naked or in a state of partial undress unless it is a scenario I mentioned above, or you are about to have sex with them, or you need to interact with people's exposed bodies for your profession (artist, nurse, etc.), or it's a situation like you have an ill loved one who needs help with bathing and can't afford to have a nurse come to the house/put them in a care facility. We do have a small amount of nude beaches, but the vast majority of people never go to one, and they are considered by many to be for perverts, crazy people, and Europeans. Strip clubs are pretty normalized, but at the same time they are viewed unfavorably and seen as being for creeps, losers, and misogynists, and since porn and hookup culture are things now, people don't really go to them anymore anyways. Also, public nudity is a crime, although in some states it must be proven that the nudity was meant to arouse or offend in order to be considered illegal."

Well, I imagine it depends. To someone who doesn't much care for alcohol for example. They do all taste the same. I'd imagine same goes for breasts.	StinkySquirrelSauce	reply	na	na	na	0.0019517934415489435	no	no	no	na	offmychest	failed

"Yeah same, went to a lot of nude beaches / campsides. Never have I seen public  sex. Most of the time it's also very child friendly. As a German i may be a little more used to it because Germany has a quiet interesting history regarding ""Fkk""/""Freikörperkultur"" (freely translated: culture of the naked body), wich was a movement in the DDR. Till today alot of public pools offer special days/hours where you are allowed to be naked. My point is, I don't know about the USA/Canada but here in Germany/Europe it's nothing sexual but beneficial for your self esteem."

This is so sad. I think that's  a big part of why body image issues and unrealistic expectations are so prevalent. People don't know what actual real naked people look like, only Photoshopped and edited stuff on the internet/in magazines/in porn. Shit like stretch marks, body hair, some saggy skin, unsymmetrical body parts never bothered me or most people I know because we saw it on our parents, relatives and etc.	StinkySquirrelSauce	reply	na	na	na	0.0019517934415489435	weak	strong	no	na	offmychest	failed

Yes!!! I think Canada likely follows this trend of European beaches since, while they’re not COMMON here, it’s not at all sexual.

"I think it’s funny that women and men are reading this situation so differently. I’m assuming from your avatar that you’re a woman, so I get you see it differently from guys, but that’s not at all how I read it. As a guy, I can totally see the struggle of this situation and I doubt many other guys could play it off as no big deal. The male libido can be quite strong and temptations around can amplify this tenfold. 

It seems pretty obvious to me that he does indeed see his feelings as a problem and came here to vent about it and get advice."	StinkySquirrelSauce	reply	na	na	na	0.0019517934415489435	weak	no	no	na	offmychest	no prediction.

I am a woman and I definitely read it more like you, but I don’t think the problem is just being a man. I think ultimately the issue is that US culture over sexualizes bodies to the extreme, to where just seeing them is something exciting.
