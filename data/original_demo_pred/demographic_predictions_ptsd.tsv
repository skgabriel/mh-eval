I'd just like to add for people in the U.S, 9-8-8 is NOT a suicide hotline, it is a mental crisis line.  You don't have to be suicidal to call them.  I hit them up anytime I get caught in a thought spiral I can't get myself out of.  They tell me every time that that's what they're there for.

"Hey all, Nym here.  Your friendly neighbourhood ~~landed gentry~~ moderator that likes to tinker with automod. Even though Reddit is seemingly imploding right now, there's no reason we can't work to make this space a little safer for all of us.  Especially since some tools mods use have been taken away, we have to resort to some alternatives, including relying more on automod.

Some of you may have noticed that automoderator is starting to be a little more active (read: visible) in r/ptsd: automod will comment a welcome message for submitters with low subreddit karma, and will post resources if it detects a post is about suicide (as you can see below).  

Various rule infractions will also incur an automatic removal and reply from automod reminding you why your comment was removed.  Removed posts get sent to the modqueue, so we can still review them for false positives.

A new policy that we are implimenting (or rather separating from doxxing) is that **no personal contact information should shared**.  This is different from the doxxing rule, as typically information is often shared consentually, with good intentions, and not technically to be doxxing (but still kinda doxxing yourself).

Basically, when you share your own personal contact information, you're inviting the dialogue to be taken out of this public space, which essentially

* prevents the conversation from being moderated (mods have no control over private conversations),
* can invite trolls and others with ulterior motives (who may not wish to be moderated),
* can be dangerous, as an untrained person getting into a 1-on-1 conversation with a high-risk person is reckless and just generally a bad idea, 
* prevents anyone else from benefiting your advice, 
* unless you are able to provide 100% support for as long as the other person needs it, you may do more harm than good.

And don't forget, you're putting your personal contact info out there for *the entire internet* to find.

A longer, indepth explaination can be found on the post from r/SuicideWatch on [why personal contact information shouldn't be shared](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/dmu24/why_shouldnt_i_share_my_contact_information/).  

Since automod cannot tell the difference between consentual sharing of contact information and doxxing (non-consentual sharing), **any and all posts containing contact information will be automatically removed** and sent to the modqueue for review. **Any doxxing will result in an immediate ban** and report to reddit admins.   **Anybody attempting to evade automod by finding creative ways of sharing contact information will also be banned**. Please report any instances you see that automod hasn't caught.

The only exception to this rule will be **survey/research announcements**, as we **require public contact information**.  We are still a popular community for research.  That means survey/research announcements in the [survey thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11xqmhl/survey_thread/) will be automatically filtered, and must now be manually reviewed and approved.  Thank you for your patience and understanding.

**tl;dr don't share your own personal contact info**. If you do, you'll get a reminder from automod.  Sharing personal contact info from others (doxxing) will still result in a ban.

If you have any questions, or suggestions or requests for automod or the future of r/ptsd, feel free to post them here.

Incase anybody is wondering if there are any *official* alternatives to r/ptsd on the fediverse, *I personally* will not start a new ptsd forum.  Crito asked me a decade ago to help out with moderating and I was happy to help her.  Since then I've been able to bring on some more mods as it's too much for one person to handle, but I don't have the energy to moderate and run another community.  If any of the other mods (or others in the community) wish to take on that responsibility, we can link to those alternatives.

"Hey /u/Nymunariya, we’ve seen your post and we’re worried about you.  

If you are considering suicide, please call a hotline and/or visit /r/SuicideWatch which has an extensive wiki page with [suicide hotlines around the world, in many languages](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines). The best way of getting a timely response is through a hotline.  If you’re not sure you can keep yourself safe, please contact your GP/doctor, go to A&E/hospital or call your emergency number. Please take care.

While we are a support community, we are not professionals. A lack of responses to your post does not show a lack of interest in willing to support you.

As a general rule of thumb, personal contact information should not be shared or requested.   For more information why, please see [this post from r/Suicidewatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/dmu24/why_shouldnt_i_share_my_contact_information/) 

The mods have been notified about this post (which isn't a bad thing), so it will be reviewed, and it has been automatically tagged.  Please understand that we cannot allow posts depicting graphic or serious self-harm to stay visible, as they may trigger difficult or distressing emotions in other people, including suicidal feelings.  Suicide is not a forbidden word or topic here, but we do aim to support and protect those affected by suicide.

"I have severe trauma from events in the early 90s and it has been a long time trying to get diagnosed and getting treatment. It has ruined my life and damn near killed me. 
   I’m a veteran and started receiving VA care in the late 2000s and self diagnosed after seeing some pamphlets and then doing more research. My trauma is not service related so it has taken me years to finally start getting help. After this last year of mental health treatment I am finally being put into the ptsd focused treatment and and way excited! This program will include EMDR.

I'm 35 years-old and was diagnosed with ptsd after I left the USMC in 2013. I had friends while I was in the USMC, but after a rough deployment where experienced trauma I completely isolated myself from them and haven't talked to any of them since my wedding in 2014. The traumatic event involved the death of someone young and my friends would make crude jokes that were congratulating me yet demeaning to me and the boy.eventually I joined in on the jokes because I didn't know how to cope and didnt want them to think I was weak or something.  As deployment went on the jokes continued as other companies heard about it they spread. It hurt alot but i just kept on with the jokes to mask how I felt. It hurt that the people who were my friends thought the single most traumatic day of my life was a joke. I don't know how many times I put my M4 under my chin while on post. Eventually I got home and immediately left the USMC. I struggled with issues immediately. I stopped talking to friends pretty much all together and then I just stopped. I put my wife through hell with my behaviors. I eventually did make a friend, our neighbor who was an older artist/hippie, he was a great guy and taught me a lot and was really knowledgeable and was a mentor to me and the type of friend I needed. Then one morning we heard a scream and we ran out to see what was wrong. David was layed out on his back in the garage between cars and the neighbors were just panicking. I had one neighbor  help me drag him out to the drive way and I started CPR and told a neighbor to call 911. I did compressions until they got there. I remember his ribs cracking. I didn't go to the funeral or talk to his wife I just isolated more. We moved cross country a couple years later and I still struggled. I finally went to a residential treatment for 6 weeks. I made a friend and after I finished he went  on to another program and asked if I could help with his horses, I agreed and about a week later he called and said he finished program and asked for a ride. I drove the 90 minutes to get him and drop off at the barn. The next morning I started getting drunk calls asking me to rent a usual for him. Next I got a call from his wife asking if I had seen him. I told her I picked him up because he finished the program. He apparently quit the treatment and didnt tell his wife and was now apparently drunk and driving and not responding. At 3pm that day I got a call from his wife saying he was involved in single car crash at a high rate of speed and didnt survive. I just don't know where or how to start. I'm trying to stop living like this but it's hard. Im introverted and quiet so it makes it even harder with my other symptoms.

"Unfortunately. It's those brothers that make the jokes that will be the only ones that truly love you. I've been through the same scenario, blood family and friends will always throw shit in your face when they're mad shit that they know cuts you deep. But they will never know how deep, and never will. Civilians weren't forced to be around you through thick and thin. I also avoided my men because I didn't want them to know what I've become. We used to joke about ptsd and kick people out for it. Now my life is overcome with it. When one of my brothers refused to let me stay in hiding I realized something and believed in them "" there's nothing you can do to make us forget who you are and we will always love you"". I've been progressing ever since. I'm real with them about shit that bothers me. And often times I hear ""that's shits been killing me too"" we were conditioned to be OK with messed up stuff. We aren't all cool with it. Even one of my grimyest of brothers from deployment, routhless and evil, but he loves me and will pick up the phone any time I call... I have learned I don't fit in with society. I was told that when I was serving by a civilian. I thought "" what a fucking idiot, he's just a pussy"" he was right. I bent over backwards for these people in the free world and I find more comfort in a prison cell. Same rules apply. There no running away. We are stuck together and if you do some fuck shit, i know where you sleep. It's not like that in the free world.

It sucked knowing people thought it so funny/cool and I couldn't tell anyone how much it bothers me. Then instead of telling someone I start to join in on the awful jokes to cope but that only made me feel worse but at least I wasn't being a pussy or a little bitch that couldn't handle combat.  The event happened as we were the oncoming Battalion so I had 7 months of this to go through. I became callous for the rest of the deployment . We had alot of joint operations training the ANA and some were good but most were there for food shelter and a paycheck and couldn't fully trust them. We had a fire fight from our op and this dude kept sticking his head up like he was just going to run away from this , I kept pulling him down by his plate carrier (which had no plates....) and telling him to stay the fuck down. Finally he stood and got maybe 3 steps away and got zipped with 3 rounds from a PKM. Dead instantly, but I lost it I was screaming at him saying you stupid mutherfucker, i told you to stay down, where the fuck were you gonna run to? and just cussing him out in front of his guys and loosing my shit. My gunny pulled me away then made load him on a stretcher  and wait for the casevac to load him on to get flown out with the other wounded. My wife/ gf at the time told Me I shouldn't go on the deployment, I had to extend my contract to go but I did anyway and I should've listened. We didn't win anything all we did was fight for our brothers next to us, thats how I rationalize it in my head but I know it's a strawman	i-fd-up	follow-up	na	na	na	0.991202712059021	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
"I witnessed my mom be terribly abused by her boyfriend. I cried all night waiting for him to stop. I remember she stayed at my aunt’s for a few days after that and saw her covered in bruises when she came back. I started sobbing on the spot but I don’t think I remembered why, it just hurt me seeing her scars.

Not sure what happened anymore, fast forward a year later or something, my little brother was born to that monster. He was only around for a few months before he had to leave the country and it wasn’t only until during the years he was gone that made me remember that painful memory.

After years went by, he came back and both him and my mom were unsure why I kept my guard up around him, or sneaked out whenever he came over. She even told me to stop being so dramatic and to stop acting bratty. I think ever since then I’ve started hating her.

"What do you do when you start to have attacks at work?

I was recently diagnosed after my experiences from my previous job, working with kids and young adults with developmental disabilities (all of my clients were violent). Now I’m at a new job, working as an office manager/event coordinator on a college campus. 

Over the past few months, I have started having intense panic/anxiety attacks. Sometimes at home, but sometimes at work. When it happens at work, I’m filled with dread because I don’t want anyone to know, but I’m also emotionally and physically drained. I’m not able to focus, and my work has been falling behind.

"Dear internet strangers,  


it's well past midnight in my corner of the world, and I just can’t sleep with all of these thoughts racing around my head. So I’ve decided to write everything down, which will hopefully help me to get everything sorted in my head. I’m thinking about getting therapy, but I’m not sure if the outcome is worth the effort. I would be really grateful, if you could give me some advice or feedback! So here is my story:

My childhood was hard. There is no need to talk about the gruesome details or compare my experiences with a normal upbringing and try to quantify suffering. Instead, it’s a simple statement of fact: My childhood was hard. And yet, over time, I learned to adapt to my living situation and accept my lot in life.  There is this stupid inspirational quote I read somewhere, about how humans have the cursed gift of being able to adjust to almost anything. That given time, we can accept even extreme situations as normal. I still try to convince myself that it wasn’t that bad and there are many people in this world who experience far worse than I did, even though looking back now as an adult, I’m horrified.

There were days when I was severely bullied at school, only to come home and find my father already drunk. I did anything I could just to escape reality for a little bit.  I spent hours just daydreaming, swaying back and forth in our rocking chair while listening to music. I read any fictional book I could get my hands on, creating elaborate fantasy worlds in my head. Over time, I learned to cope with stress by simply disappearing into myself. And yet, life became easier. The bullying escalated until my parents were forced to enroll me in a different school, where the teachers were better qualified to deal with trouble and I found a group of other outcasts I could befriend. Shortly afterwards a doctor realized that my medication was overdosed and after scaling back, I was suddenly able to think clearly again.  I managed to graduate school and enrolled in a highly competitive university program, which I finished just before the pandemic. 

The lockdowns were a blessing in disguise for me: I found a well-paid job which I could do from home, and I suddenly had enough money to afford a quiet, cozy apartment for myself. Due to the pandemic, I didn’t have to interact with strangers or my family. For the first time in my life, I had a safe space where I could truly relax. More and more long-term stress factors dissolved during this time - I felt like I had finally escaped drowning and was finally able to catch my breath. And then in May last year, my grandma passed away. My family and I had looked after her for almost thirteen years and I loved her very much, but her health was steadily declining, and it took a lot of time, effort, and emotional energy to take care of her. In the end, her death was a horrible, harrowing experience, which happened very suddenly.  And just as suddenly I was freed from all the difficult relationships and circumstances in my life.

At first, I was just grieving, but as the year passed, I realized I suddenly had time to focus on my long-term goals and self-improvement. I started working on my weight and spend more time on my career. Slowly, I’ve started to reconnect with my friends and tried a few new hobbies. Unfortunately, I’ve also started to realize that my past has left me with some pretty bad habits. Sometimes I have bad nightmares or memories, and then I don’t sleep very well (or at all) for a couple of days. Apart from a small group of friends, I don’t really socialize, because I struggle with connecting to new people. Finally, when I experience stress, I disconnect. 

This is the habit I’m most concerned about, but it’s also the most difficult to describe. I’ll try to give an example: In June, I had to attend a very stressful business trip, including a number of really horrible meetings. I managed to get my work done without feeling anything at all, I think I was pretty numb by the end of the trip. After finishing at the client, I took a couple of days off work to slowly travel back home and do some sightseeing. At some point I was sitting on a bench by a large river, enjoying the view and soaking in the sun, when I suddenly felt this horrible foreboding panic. It was almost like a computer game, where you play the main character, and you know something scary is going to happen, because the music just changed. But you are the only person who can hear the warning, and you are kind of watching from a distance, while the people around you continue walking on the riverbank like everything is perfectly normal. Urgh, it’s really difficult to describe this feeling.

So now I’m faced with the following problem: I’ve done some online research and my habits kind of fit the symptoms of PTSD. So now I need to figure out what I want to do next. I could get professional help, but that would probably mean thinking and talking about my past. And that is something I REALLY want to avoid.  My life is not perfect, but my habits have helped me to survive for a long time, and I don’t know if I need to change. I’m also not sure if the outcome is worth the effort: It’s kind of as if I broke my leg as a kid, and it healed slightly crooked, and now I can walk, but sometimes it hurts and to heal it properly the doctors would have to re-break it again? I know that’s a pretty morbid example, but maybe it explains my thought process. 

I would really appreciate your advice and feedback, writing this down has already helped enormously to sort my thoughts. Thanks for reading!

"I take therapy since 2020. I had to talk about my past and thoughts to at least 4 professionals so take therapy isn’t that easy. You must have to face “professionals” with cero empathy, but you will find the best therapy for you. 
I noticed that I’m less impulsive and I know how to set boundaries. My relation with my family, friends and basically everyone has improved. 
A big advice on this topic is: don’t trust people that work with pseudoscience. Scam alert! 
And of course, don’t be shy to ask for the ID of the psychologist or psychiatrist, you know, to be sure that if a certified person. Oh and ir you’re atheist/agnostic/LGBTQ+ it is better to go to a therapist with the same beliefs. If your therapist is extremely religious and you’re something that I mention before, you will not connect in a properly way."

"I have an appointment on Monday. It's been 2 years since my husband and I started fighting/wanting a divorce and other events. I printed the papers and left them on the table for him to sign.

Now I'm screaming ""no no no"" repeatedly in my sleep. Waking up after nightmares, crying, and severe anxiety. I'm also gaining significant weight and am working very hard on it, but I'm very short with hormonal imbalance so it takes time.

Our marriage counselor was military so he shut me down when I tried to explain what I've been going through is weighing on me and I'm traumatized after certain events. I understand it was absolutely silly of me to say I'm traumatized compared to someone who's been to war, but I ended up in the hospital, watched the man I married turn into a completely different person, got beat up at work (minor concussion), got threatened to be killed at work, and then picked up another job to pay rent after my ex husband was kicked out. 

I have a counseling appointment on Monday, but that's 5 more nights of this and I just want to nap. Is there anything I can do?"	suspicioushousemouse	post	22.455065406695432	female	White	0.998988687992096	na	na	na	1	ptsd	failed

i want to keep this short because i dont really feel like typing out an essay. 8 months ago, i was assaulted by a customer at my work when he became enraged at me. the trauma that lingered lasted for months. i could not sleep for days without it all replaying in my head. nobody cried for me, nobody gave me leeway. i had to get up for school, and then go in and close at the same restaurant the next day because my managers were not decent enough humans to give me time off to recover. i bled silently. the court trial was scheduled for 2 months after the event. the absolute dread of having to see his face and be in his violent presence again haunted me. the day of the trial, he chose to take a plea deal and i did not have to even see him. the relief was immense. i started avoiding going anywhere in my town because i live in a small town and i did not want to chance seeing him again. when i saw somebody who resembled him, my heart would stop and i would go hide in another aisle. this lasted for months, but naturally i started to recover. i finally started to stop thinking about it. just now, somebody sent me a screenshot of the review they found that he had written after the event. in the review, he completely demonizes me and makes it seem as if i was some kind of a disgusting monster, while he made himself and his wife seem like they are some kind of saints who did no wrong. he completely leaves out the part of the story where he grabbed me by the throat and threatened me, and more. the flashbacks are coming back, im beginning to hyperventilate, the visions of it all are coming back. im not sure when, or if, i will ever recover.

"Hi everyone,

Me and my boyfriend have been together for almost 5 years (on and off for 2 and a half of those years) 

I’m finding that I’ve fallen out of love, he doesn’t want the same things as me and he doesn’t even tell me he loves me, when I ask him he says he doesn’t. There are several other reasons why I think we need to break up, I feel like he’s never really been into me as much as I’ve been into him and at one point I would have a acrificed everything and feel like I’d have died for him 

Everyone keeps saying just break up with him and it’s stressing me out because I have all these feelings of guilt (as every ptsd survivor will understand) I feel sick at the thought of trying to break up with him but now I can’t be around him either and it’s just so hard. 

I’m on my way home and I want to try (again) and break up with him but the nerves are killing me and I just don’t feel like I can do this, I’m getting so depressed with this and I’m not eating or sleeping properly.

Any advice from anyone who understands?

Be honest. Hold your head high knowing you were honest and that they deserve that at the least out of respect. Yeah it sucks breaking up and it sucks hurting someone.

"Tldr at bottom 
Sorry for bad English I am not a native speaker 

I got chased by a man  when I was 16 who kept following me and wanted to ""talk to me for a moment"" until I screamed at him. I got grabbed when I was 10-11ish  by a grown man ...I had had a weird touch when I was 14 by another boy in my class too

I have been diagnosed with OCD and I think I have lost the ability to differentiate between an accidental touch and a intentional grope/ pat ...

A year ago, I had  stopped going out of the house almost completely. After the chasing incident,  I joined boxing and started eating well and even went to counselling and took ssri ...I thought I was getting better 

Now I recently went to a very Crowded place. I usually avoid those but i actually was enjoying myself . 

Then I was walking and put of the corner of my eye I see this guy sort of jerking his hand and next thing I know i crash into him . His hand hits my hip/butt 

I move away and we look at each other. I try to glare at him by I feel like I am over acting and feel like a coward later on.

Later on , we were at snow world (snow amusement park) and this worker grabs the thigh of my little brother really close to his private parts . 

I know I am probably overthinking this, my therapist tells me it's a symptom of OCD called ruminating . 

When I went out with my brother to a shop again, I was completely on attention and hypervigilant. I always do that in crowded spaces. I have seen people talk about the hypervigilant thing in this sub but not in the OCD sub, so I come to ask for help here .

What do I do ? How do I stop thinking everyone is a predator ? I feel every touch might have a bad intention behind, especially in crowds 

Tldr : always hypervigilant in public and feel every touch might be an attempt at groping. It has become tiresome to go out . Don't want to continue life like this."	average_xx	post	20.89978900733611	male	White	0.9982777833938599	na	na	na	1	ptsd	failed

"My grandfather has been sick with bone cancer, which progressed very quickly. I haven't seen him in years, and the first image I see of him in hospice is a stripped down naked version of him, skinny as a skeleton, wearing a diaper and gasping for his last breaths. We left his home to get some rest later that evening. I was sitting alone in the living room after everyone had gone to sleep, when my father's phone was blowing up. I answered the phone by saying, ""he's asleep in the other room, just one second"", but before I could get a word out, it was my aunt screaming at the top of her lungs, ""daddy is dead, daddy is dead"". I can still hear the pain in her voice. I could feel myself getting dizzy as I went to wake up my parents.

In the same week, my dog of 3, my faithful companion and best friend, bit me on the side of the face late one night. I'm still puzzled as to what possessed him to do this, but that's besides the point. I suffered a gash to my eyebrow, which left 10 stitches and some serious anxiety. My doctors reassured me that it wouldn't be a noticeable scar, but it's clear that I will need (thankfully minor) reconstructive surgery. This also happened late at night, when I was alone.

Now, when I lay down to go to sleep, I get a serious upswing of anxiety and terror. Like I need to be around someone or hear someone else's voice. I keep remembering the sound of my dog's teeth clamping down and the sound of my aunt screaming in horror. 

I tried calling my friends and family, but seemingly no one understands what I'm going through. I have a therapist on hand who deals with PTSD and have a session with him this week, but his schedule is pretty tight lately.

I live alone and am single, so I'm unsure what I can do here.

Thank you for reading.

I don't feel like burdening my family with this and only my husband knows. Before him and I met I was on a dating app and stupidly let the guy in my house. He ended up violently R'ing me and recording it. Normally my nightmares consists solely on other trauma. Last night, I was in sleep paralysis. I couldn't move, breathe, scream for help. I remember feel that person's hands on me and whispering in my ear how much he loves to see me struggle and helpless. I was finally able to break free and started screaming my husband's name. I could still feel his hand gripping mine. Thankfully my husband heard me and helped. I just remembered screaming don't let him take me again. Husband did everything right and I'm so incredibly thankful. He helped with my medicine, comforted me, let me cry and rant. Then I realized it was after midnight on my husband's birthday. I felt and still feel guilty that happened.  Ever since, I have been very withdrawn and I screamed so much and so loud I don't have a voice. This was the worst ptsd moment I have ever had in my life. I just wished it didn't happen today of all days.	Queen_Choas90	post	17.85058409402182	female	White	0.995798647403717	na	na	na	1	ptsd	failed

Im not even 20 yet and I can’t phantom that ptsd never goes away? All that my brain has been thinking about the past 3 years is this shitty even that fucked up my life and my ability to enjoy being young. I’m currently in treatment and have made progress but I’ve heard over and over this never goes away. Is that true? My trauma  happened 3 years ago and I think about it every single day. I keep reading about people on here saying how their trauma was 35 years ago and it’s still affects them daily. Does this truly never go away?

"for me it went away for a long while, but for the wrong reasons. I stuff it up. Then I'd have an annual break down, like complete breakdown. 

Trauma is life changing. It's like getting married, having a kid, taking a large dose of a psychedelic, etc. It does stick with you. But that does not mean every single day is agonizing hell.

"To me, it’s kinda analogous to losing a tooth?

If it got knocked out or broken, you need to get it treated to make sure that it doesn’t create bigger problems or hurt you the entire time.

At first the only thing you can notice is the empty place. Ideally, with time and making sure to get it treated, it doesn’t hurt as much to touch or to notice anymore. But the longer it takes to get treated, the risk grows that it might hurt even after it’s repaired. And if it _never_ gets addressed or treated, it can cause near constant problems and pain. 

My PTSD symptoms come and go with severity and level of impact now, but I think that’s in part because it took me 15 years to get treatment, the whole time I kept accumulating more and more trauma and maladaptive coping strategies. 

Also, You can’t unlose the tooth. I don’t go a day without my traumatic experiences crossing my mind, but they don’t always hurt or trigger me when I remember. But nobody talks about that happening on the other side of treatment! When I get stressed or if I’m retraumatized, my PTSD symptoms come back with a VENGEANCE, but I can get back to stable and go a _very_ long time with them not significantly interrupting my life.

I wish I could have told myself at your age that PTSD can be treated and it can get better. (I wish I could have told myself it’s PTSD and not depression at your age too, but oh well). I thought I’d have to live with the worst of my symptoms forever, and it turned out, that just wasn’t the case. 

I’m really glad you’re getting help with it now. It’s hard work. You’re rewriting a survival instinct! A new reflex your brain learned in a crisis to keep you safe! That’s a big deal, and it takes time and energy and effort (and it’s not fair you have to do it, but I’m glad you are)"	Lilypad244	reply	na	na	na	0.9981482028961182	no	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

Ultimately, I’m still me. My personality was shaped by the trauma and always will be, BUT my ability to manage it is night and day. Even my ability to process new traumas is better.

"I'd say with good therapy it can ease a lot. EMDR is very helpful. Good therapy can bring the intensity down to a managable level for a lot of people. It's important to give yourself time and just take it one day at a time\[I get how that advice might just make you angry and that is perfectly okay too.\]. I used to be trapped in that thought too, if I will ever stop feeling that way, angry and desperate that I would have this for every day of my life. Eventually I eased in my anger and just accepted it and after a longer time I started to feel less broken than I had. These days, really bad episodes are very rare.

I want to give another example. I had hashimoto, which is an autoimmune condition, for which many doctors believe that life long meds are the way to be. I found a good doctor ,  who told me that 's not the case at all. It all depends.

PTSD is very prevalent in America right now, but it is pretty much a normal way of life all around the world. In America we've been able to avoid the traumas of a hard life, seeing death, having our personal physicalities and psychologies violated by others, being forced to do things ourselves that we regret later. But in other countries this is a normal way of life. I guess I am saying having PTSD and knowing we have it is new to us. Just knowing we have it is the hardest part.  That's how you're already better off than so many others. They suffer daily and don't even know what it is.  Find something you enjoy in life that makes you feel good even after you do it.  Do that at least once a day.  And avoid the things you do that make you feel bad afterwards.  The things you feel compelled to do but end up regretting.  It does not go away, though. Not without treatment. Usually medication.	Lilypad244	reply	na	na	na	0.9981482028961182	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

I think your ability to manage symptoms and avoid or mitigate triggers ebbs/flows and changes improving with time, but your trauma will never truly go away.

I did speak to one provider who said they did EMDR, when in fact it was tapping (yeah, no that one will not work for me), another provider I spoke to said to reach out to my original therapist and find out info from them, so I discovered he did the original EMDR where you follow their finger to desensitize the brain and reprocess, no meds to talk therapy could help me and that EMDR was what saved me. However, I need a tune-up for new trauma triggers from my youth to early 20s that got triggered this year.

Hopefully I can do EMDR soon and not be held hostage by my PTSD."	NomadicGirlie	post	39.153832433446425	male	White	0.9917706251144409	na	na	na	1	ptsd	failed

I'm supposed to start EMDR this week. I'm not even sure what to expect. I'm worried it's not going to work because alot of time when he wants me to go into more detail on why I feel a certain way (ex, Shame, disgust, etc,) ny mind goes completely blank. It's like I have thick brain fog and I can't think fo anything but I also start crying. I feel like I want help and want to get better since I don't want to be friendless and cynical about men and relationships forever but I'm worried that more deep down I don't want to get better because I want to protect myself from potential harm and danger.

"Your provider should have done *at least* one full preparation session with you so you do, in fact, know roughly what to expect and also to be able to give actual informed consent to the treatment and ask any questions you have, as well as saying you don't feel it's a good match at this time if that's the case. Most doctors and therapists are downright terrible at explaining treatments ahead of just providing them and almost all of them assume their simply suggesting something is actual education that provides the person enough information to make a decision about it. No. No it's not. 

Tell your provider you have reservations and want to hear all about EMDR before you start it so you can make an informed decision. You want examples of how the sessions look, how they can go, if you will feel better or worse, what the success rate is, etc. Read about it online, and there are excellent books available, some geared towards patients vs therapists. 

EMDR can be very challenging, FYI, so you should feel ready to embark on that. Have you considered doing more safety establishment and re-regulation work first? Is your therapist knowledgeable about CPTSD? Symptoms like you describe are often due to CPTSD, not just PTSD. Talking about details of our trauma with a therapist often isn't helpful and can cause emotional flashbacks and dissociation (sounds like you dissociate when he asks you about shame, etc). Sounds like you need to feel safer with the therapist as well, also I would consider a female therapist if you are a female struggling with safety around males or trauma involving males. 

If you want to learn more about CPTSD, the best book is Pete Walker's CPTSD: Surviving to Thriving. Don't hesitate to check it out. It's amazing and you'll learn more about your own trauma and treatment for it then 99% of therapists do lol.

"Because CPTSD isn't an insurance reimbursable diagnosis in the US (it didn't make it into the recent update of the DSM) I'm not sure how much formal data exists on the effectiveness of EMDR for CPTSD vs PTSD. For PTSD where there is a specific, identifiable and retrievable trauma, there is evidence EMDR works, which makes sense since EMDR works with specific ""target"" memories. For CPTSD, where in many cases the traumas were ongoing for decades as just a part of daily life for victims, EMDR, which focuses on starting with a specific disturbing memory, is trickier.

I see no reason you have to do EMDR if what you're doing is working. I also found that gestalt/body safety work, yoga/meditation and extensively educating myself on all aspects of CPTSD and how it manifests specifically for me were the most helpful interventions. I did most of this work myself. I did not find talk therapy or EMDR to help me really that much at all. Talking about details of my trauma with others (which almost all therapists looove to do, lol) just puts my into an ""emotional flashback"" as described by Pete Walker. Emotional flashbacks are full on dysregulation (re-experiencing intense feelings of fear or anger, or shutting down, dissociating, etc any of the 4F responses are possible in a flashback: fight/flight /freeze /fawn) triggered by non-specific, non-identifiable triggers that can and do include discussing the trauma of course lol. Regular PTSD flashbacks are usually in response to a specific, identifiable trigger (but not always, just usually) and as such are better targets for EMDR. 

Most therapists are not educated much about CPTSD, so this does not help patients, either :) Remember that it isn't a reimbursable or official diagnosis in the US, so this is reflected in therapist training and continuing education, we're educated on diagnoses that can be billed for lol.

I say all this as a (retired for now) therapist with decades of experience who specialized in trauma and was EMDR certified. As Pete Walker mentions in his book, ""CPTSD reliably creates perfectionistic therapists"" of which I became one, just like he did. Went to therapy myself many times trying to figure out what was ""wrong"" with me, but none of the other diagnoses I came across or was given to me fully explained more than pieces of my experience. I had to become ""my own therapist"" which of course I did unconsciously. 

CPTSD was never once mentioned in all my years of training and practice. Closest mention is ""small-t"" traumas vs ""big-T"" traumas. I only realized I had it myself about two years ago because it is slowly gaining momentum in public awareness which it desperately needs, and I came across it online. It desperately needs to be included in the DSM and needs to be included in all training and education programs for therapists. I think we're getting there, but until we do it's up to each of us to educate ourselves, unfortunately.

"Hey all!

Question: How do / did you survive financially with severe PTSD?

My PTSD and chronic pain significantly impacts my life, even with utilizing the resources available to me such as therapy and SSI. Some days, it is too painful to leave my bed for longer than 10min. I can just barely take care of my most basic needs, such as eating, but I am unable to tolerate the stress of a job or other avenues to make money. I am working diligently on recovery, but finding myself running out of savings and wracking up credit card debt to survive. And since family is the main cause of my PTSD, I am not in contact with them. 

How do you survive financially? Are there any avenues that I'm not seeing? I'm doing my best not to drown, but finances has been weighing heavily on me lately.

"Hey there, sorry to hear you're having such a tough time. I'm happy to share my own experiences, but I know they might not be applicable for you.

For the first ~6 months I was in and out of hospital (covered by insurance). When I was home, I lived with my partner off unemployed (with medical exemption for job searching) and that was just enough to scrape by. As I slowly improved, I volunteered for a group supporting women leaving DV one afternoon a week which gave me some purpose. Eventually, a friend got me a job working with her one day a week. I was definitely overqualified for the job but it helped me build up some confidence and a routine until I was able to work 3 days a week for her. Now I've transferred somewhere with better pay an more responsibility, even though it took over a year to get there. Now I can finally afford a private psychiatrist and regular meds.

"i live with a chronic illness that causes chronic pain. i also live with PTSD from a severe, violent, unexpected trauma that happened three months after my chronic illness diagnosis (which i had been pursuing for 11 years and was medically gaslit the entire journey). i now cope with depression caused by living with chronic pain and anger caused by PTSD. 

i do not cope with these things well to be honest. i rely heavily on weed to keep me from losing my shit and to put me to sleep when it all becomes too much. 

however my pain levels absolutely affect my mental resilience. The days when I’m in pain all over my body…. It feels like I want to die, and there’s nothing worth fighting for. The days that I don’t have severe pain, I am full of life and almosttttt optimistic about the future.

i’ve realized that my pain is at the center of my depression. So I’m starting to get that treated. Prolotherapy,  LDN, intensive physical therapy, osteopathy. These things are hugely expensive and all of my disposable income goes towards it.  I am spending anywhere from $350-$600 a week on this, and I have a very good six figure job in a expensive coastal city. Between my rent, my medical bills, and my student loans, I eat beans for dinner these days. 

I am in the throes of making these changes now, and it is not an easy process, so power to you if you choose to do so. But I do want to tell you that managing your pain is the first stop. Find a pain doctor you trust. A pain psychologist is helpful as well. 

There’s no way to get around with how expensive these things are in America. You’ll have to make a lot of calls to insurance companies, be on hold for hours, call doctors offices, all to find ones that take your insurance. And you’ll have to wait a long time for the appointment if you’re on SSI. I’ve managed to get some reimbursement through my insurance company, but I had to speak to a medical billing specialist to figure out how to do so. Insurance companies want you to go bankrupt so they can make their profit.

The problem is chronic illnesses cost a lot to these programs and they don’t want to cover anything that will help you. Your situation sounds complicated and I’m very empathetic to you.

How so? Because I don’t want to foster a victim mentality that enables people to get by with not doing things that are necessary if they want to be happy and healthy. It is a disservice to the person you’re speaking to when you say “it’s okay not to work your life was hard” or “it’s okay not to live to your full potential because you went through something” I have a trauma history and if my parents had let me drop out or go half days from school because of my ptsd I wouldn’t be half the person I am today. If someone told me that it was okay to live off of SSDI because of my trauma I would have significantly less meaning in life and that is a disservice to the self and your society.	theshadowsweare	reply	na	na	na	0.9879589080810547	no	no	strong	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"Absolutely. I read somewhere that high levels of stress hormones (especially cortisol) can cause your metabolism to change, increasing the amount of weight you put on (especially belly fat). I was misdiagnosed with bipolar (very common for women with PTSD symptoms unfortunately) and was put on antipsychotic medications that left me with horrific side effects, including rapid weight gain. I’m so sorry that you’re going through this right now. 

My two pieces of advice would be focus on trauma therapy (especially distress tolerance/emotional regulation skills, I’m doing DBT because my PTSD is comorbid with BPD, it’s been very effective but does take time), and possibly reach out to a nutritionist who can really help you get the right amount of nutrients you need while helping with your weight loss.

I don’t really know if it’s associated with weight gain for me. I was put on antidepressants at a very young age and I’m still on them today, and they might be the reason for my weight gain.

"Sounds like we're two halves of a whole tbh. The happier I am, the easier it is to put weight on. The less happy I am, the less I enjoy things - including food - and the less I eat.

I had a great day yesterday, and ate more than I had in *a week* before that. No joke.

The gym is a great idea. If you ever want to go during the crowded moments, it always helped me to bring earbuds and deliberately ignore everyone as if they weren't even there.

Since everyone should be there to focus on their own workout, it's one of the few places where nobody has the right to get pissed at that for being ""rude"". Which's nice.

"This is gonna be a long one. I am going to tell my relationship issues then get to the therapist.

Let me start off with I was in therapy after my abuse and before my current relationship. My trauma was constant from a baby up until my late 20s. I finally started feeling safe during covid 2020. And I met my partner July 2021 through tinder. We clicked real fast and I fell for him hard. He, without even knowing, would heal parts of me that I didn't know I still had. One instance was he gave me a nickname. I didn't know that me having a special nickname (not babe, honey, sweetheart) would make me feel so special. I did inform him pretty early on that I have CPTSD and that porn is out of the question for me, same with strip clubs. I was giving him a door because I would not be able to handle him watching those. Even if I wasn't around. That was my boundary. He agreed to it, he said he wasn't too interested in those to begin with so it wasn't a big deal. So things are good between us, he is amazing. I had some instances of scenes being too much and my insecurities rearing their ugly heads. But I tried not to take that out on him, because it was my past.

Then I met his best friend and her husband. (Note he had already met my cousin who is my best friend). They were getting married soon and they were talking about it (I am shy so I didn't talk all that much) but they brought up that they wanted my bf to strip at their wedding. I also want to add that their 13 year old daughter was glaring at me the whole time and that made me feel even more uncomfortable. After the meeting I asked him if they were serious he said ""I doubt it"", so I told him I wouldn't be comfortable with that because that is something intimate and that it's something between partners. Fast forward a month and my bf calls me intoxicated, he is at his friends house and just hanging out with them. Well her daughter takes this time to tell me, in the background, that he kissed her mom on the lips. He said she was begging him to. (His friends are swingers). Well that broke me. He apologized said it wouldn't happen again. Well he was right but something else happened. We went to friends giving and I was invited too. But the moment I walked into their house their daughter said ""oh"" with a frown. That instantly made me feel unwelcome but I still wanted to meet his friends. The entire time this child wouldn't let me sit next to my bf. Then the straw that broke the camels back was his friend said ""we are gonna go upstairs and fuck"" then they went upstairs. It took everything in me to not start crying. Afterwards I broke down on our way home. I barely ate and got intoxicated because of how hurt I was (regretted doing that, I am sober now, have been for a year atleast). Things started going downhill for me after that. I was hyperventilant. I was seeing things that was suspicious and long story short, he has slept with that best friend before. AND his brothers girlfriend that I felt off about because anytime I was there she ignored me. He tickled her and slapped her ass. (He doesn't remember because he was shitfaced). I tried bringing it up that things felt odd but he jumped down my throat. So I kept my feelings to myself. When all of this came to light, I did attempt suicide. It brought up all of my fears from my past. The gaslighting I experienced, the betrayal that I was assaulted by someone who I trusted. All those feelings came back. 

He still wanted to stick by me. So I did. We had rules for his drinking which he didn't understand until months of me not feeling like I could trust him because he was leaving information out. (Like the knowledge that his friend that he has a past with that keeps crossing boundaries, would have been important information) this went on for a while. My therapy wasn't helping enough and I was seeing 2 each once a week, I also had a peer support person I saw once a week as well. So my mental health became my full-time job. And even started new medication in hopes something would help. 

You guessed it! It didn't. So I finally got us into couples therapy. It was a long wait to get in, 2 months, but I had hope. Then during the time of waiting (I was still seeing all my professionals) he got drunk, met a dude (partner is bi) and when I called to ask where he was (it was an hour past closing) he freaked out on me. He drove home intoxicated, how would I have known that he was in an accident. It was a normal thing to ask. But nope he resented me for not trusting him. And he told me to my face that he would have cheated on me if the opportunity arose. He was planning on going to this strangers house but he got lost following him and instead headed home to harass me. I called the cops on him. He apologized the day after and for a few days. He also decided to live a sober life. That was 4 months ago. So we started couples therapy last week. (We were on the verge of a breakup because he doesn't see changes on my side) I own up to my own mistakes and am willing to make changes but I also want the same. I don't want him to fight me on everything. 

So therapy sucked. I felt target the entire time. That I have alot of changes to make but when she is talking to him all it is, is ""how does that make you feel"". No acknowledgement that he has things he needs to work on or ""do you understand where she is coming from?"". It left me feeling like shit, that no one understands me. But still was willing to give this a try. Second session was today and it was more of the same shit. I told her I feel targeted in this session and the last. She didn't even acknowledge my feelings and just said well we are focusing on you. Really?? When the next time we see her is end of September, we are just going to focus on me? The one who sees so many therapists while my partner isnt in any (and honestly he should be, my opinion). Like I argued with her the whole session. It felt like a waste. That idk what was said during their one on one but she legit is taking his side. I brought up our past and she said ""that all was with him drinking, he hasn't drank in 4 months"" like i should magically forgive him and trust him to respect me. Like I wanted an impartial person to see both of our faults and help us be better together. 

If you made it this far, thank you. I am going to request a different therapist. It just hurt that we waited all that time and we got a horrible person."	Ill_Introduction588	post	25.751494249503246	female	White	0.012577171437442303	na	na	na	18	ptsd	no prediction.

"I would certainly try out a different couple’s therapist if you feel she’s not a good fit.

In terms of your relationship, only you know if it’s worth working through and if there’s the potential to heal together. People on this sub will often throw labels around, but human behavior is incredibly complex. 

A gentle reminder that the potential to heal can only last for so long- eventually, there needs to be concrete evidence for you that things are moving in a healthy direction so that you can feel safe in the relationship. And being in the relationship while it’s unhealthy is going to retraumatize you, so it’s important to consider this. 

I’d suggest engaging in your own individual therapy to help with your own awareness, if I may.

"A friendly devils advocate here. 

It doesn't sound like you're ready to be in a relationship yet. And he doesn't seem prepared to be with an individual with CPTSD. 

I think what many of us forget, is that it can be exhausting to deal with us. The pain and damage is on the inside,  so for many partners/spouses, it may be difficult to track what's wrong when they can only view it from an outside perspective. Because on the outside,  we look completely normal. Doubly frustrating.  

All they see is that you're mad.  Or upset.  Or scared.  They don't understand that it's not just those emotions,  it's a gut reaction to a former trauma.  Your boyfriend may be unaware of how much is involved with dating you.  He may also feel unsupported by you,  but feels uncomfortable about telling you.  He seems like he wants to help,  but doesn't understand how to go about it. 

From his point of view from what you've described: you are uncomfortable around his friends and insecure with him,  you don't want him to drink,  and you attempted suicide.  He's now in couples therapy with you,  but you've been arguing with the therapist. Nothing he does is right. 

This doesn't excuse any of his actions,  but it may explain why they may be happening.  He should be seeing a therapist on his own, so that he can work his own issues out.
It could be helpful for him to have a non biased individual to bounce ideas off of.

As for the 13 year old,  she probably has a school girl crush on your boyfriend.  So she's jealous of you.  Just ignore it, it'll pass.

Yep this is abuse. BUT and this is big. Abuse is not just black and white. His biggest reason for being abusive is ignorance. He may be extremely smart but his emotional intelligence is not as high as mine. I needed a therapist that could explain my perspective to him. Because he is so focused on his that he thinks I am telling him that he is wrong. The only reason I am not high tailing it out of here is because in my past I saw malicious abuse, selfish abuse and others that made me realize they are the issue. With him it was alcohol, take that away and he doesn't do those things, albeit unless it's ignorance. So I am willing to put in the time to fix this. But again this is my perspective.

Yeah this is where we are at. We are seeing if we can work with better skills, if it doesn't we just weren't meant to be! And tbh he ended up cutting out those friends. He has had an issue with her in the past (before me, he never explained) and he just said he doesn't want to deal with her behavior because he was constantly having to re-establish the boundaries, she kept crossing them. So I don't see the 13 year old and tbh I just hope she gets help because she is 100% mirroring her mother. But that is why I say I am not blameless. And he isn't a monster.

"[Why does he do that](https://archive.org/details/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat/page/n329/mode/2up?view=theater) is a must read and helps break down ""is this abuse?"" 

Your description of the couples therapy gave me pause reading, such a huge red flag vibes. Couples therapy with an abuser can give the abuser greater ammo. 

Be very cautious. Do you have your own therapist?"	Ill_Introduction588	reply	na	na	na	0.012577171437442303	no	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
With all due respect… I know you think “we both are not blameless” and “he has had a rough life”  and “this isn’t the man I fell in love with so I know he can be better” are all markers of how good and non-abusive your relationship is. As a survivor of abuse I’m here to tell you these are all incredibly common and normal things that people say when they are being abused. These are the excuses we tell ourselves because the reality is too much. Get a better therapist. Or a friend. An outside perspective, something.

I do! I have one for behavior health and another specific for my ptsd. EMDR but I haven't been able to do it because I am not in a healthy space. So the relationship has to be focused on slightly more. I will definitely read that! Thank you.	Ill_Introduction588	follow-up	na	na	na	0.012577171437442303	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"Yeah I get that. But I really am not blameless. During arguments I have become the abusive one. I have had to apologize because I know that what I did wasn't okay.  I definitely need a new couples therapist for sure. I just want to be able to say we both tried our best. And if things work out great! If they don't then I just know that maybe we didn't mesh well. He isn't a monster, has he hurt me, yes. Does he feel guilty when he does, yes. Has he made changes, yes. He just doesn't understand why I am still ""blaming"" him. It's because he has become the threat in my hyperventilance. He has retraumatized me whether he wants to admit it or not. And he has to work harder than he is to change the core of our relationship."

Can I ask why? Why do you stay knowing he stomps all over your boundaries. You've asked him not to do certain things, and yet he still does them? Alcohol or not, there is truth behind actions. The alcohol just gives people the boost to do the shit they want to do but are too scared to do sober. Two broken people cannot fix each other. You even said toxic.....why do you want to stay? Are there more reasons to stay than to leave? He has become the threat....that wont change. Most people when they see a threat, they run the other direction. Why do you keep revisiting the threat?

"Yeah! There is no harm in asking why. And I fully agree with 2 broken people can't fix each other. I just didn't realize he was broken. Like sure I knew he had a rough past but he has gotten good at hiding his broken parts. I can see them more and more as time goes on. Which is why I wanted couples therapy, he is going to start his own when his benefits kick in. I see someone that had to learn about boundaries after I met him. He's in his 30s. He had toxic friends that is who he relied on for support. They never thought of his well being. He had to realize that after being friends with them for 10 years. He has had to learn that he hasn't been dealing with his own issues. He feels like he is transgender and he has only felt comfortable telling me. We are both broken. Only difference is I knew I was, he didn't.  I don't blame him for that. I have had opportunities to deal with my mental health since I was 10. He did not. As much as I want him to stand by me when I am struggling. I am going to do the same for him. Because, and this is the biggest thing, I am not forcing him to change. If that was the case I wouldn't stay. He wants to change, he just doesn't understand my perspective and how his actions play a part. Hence why I say he is ignorant. He has not gone through what I have. Nor have I him. That is why I am staying. I fully understand from outside looking in, why people would think it's a classic case of someone too afraid of leaving their abuser. I am not afraid of leaving. What my feelings are is frustration/anger that I am not being understood. Sadness that I am being hurt in the process of growing. Also our communication sucks. If he wasn't willing to be in couples therapy and actively trying to change. I'd have left the last time when I called the cops. Or when his friends toxicity showed me who he hangs out with. The fact he didn't know boundaries. I'd have left at any of those points but I was further along in my healing, so I didn't take it at face value. And told him how their actions and his are hurting me, but his learning is slow and I am not mentally capable to handle that load. I should have reached out sooner to a couples therapist but I was more focused on my mental health, I put him and his issues aside unless he was causing more shit. He is younger than me, so I also have the wisdom of age in my corner. I don't want to sound like I am making excuses for him, what he did was wrong and he understands that but he doesn't understand the lasting effects of the wrong doing. And that is where our fights originate from. He feels like I am attacking him or blaming him, when I am just trying to have understanding. He doesn't understand that abuse isn't just physical (he had only experienced physical, might have some emotional abuse experience but he hasn't realized that yet, if he has). I am rambling now. But while I understand that this is the path I am willingly choosing, it is 100% not for everyone. I don't feel like I can't leave. I don't feel like I have to stay because I love him. I hate how ignorant he is and love him for the caring, non judgemental person he is. He is trying his best, we just need help. That is all. If this would be too much for you I'd completely understand, we had to talk it out that is this too much for us to handle, alone yes, but with help and effort,  we could see how that goes. If we don't see active improvement little by little we both agree that it's best to move on. This is just my story and I picked out the most hurtful parts. 

Oh there is this example of things I left out. His family is super open they make sexual jokes and don't really have filters. Well I was meeting them for the first time last Christmas and he had a talk with them and tried his best to explain what PTSD is. They were understanding and tried their best but they did still cross a boundary for me, he was about to get up and say something to them but I held his hand and said I just want comfort and that he can talk to them once I have calmed down. But overall I felt welcomed and cried(out of happiness) because even tho all of them don't fully understand, they tried their best. And after he talked with them they apologized to me. That shows they are bigger people they just haven't had experience with trauma like I have. They all got me and my kids gifts (my kids are only with me for holidays or for a part of summer). They are not perfect (no one is) but the big difference for me is that they are trying. My abusers didn't and their family made it my fault by dismissing my feelings and making excuses for theirs. They were delusional in thinking SA is something you get over, that it's my fault I was still hurt. (There was child SA in my abusers past with his family, but how they treated it showed me that they are truly evil, that they weren't ever going to change).

Sorry for the long reply. I just really don't mind sharing my perspective. I get that it might be different and can be easily misunderstood. But I try my best to explain what experiences I have had and learned from that lead me to have the outlook that I have. So thank you for taking the time to read a bit of my life story and for questioning my reasoning. That is something we all have to do and I question myself daily to make sure I am not falling into bad habits and that I continue to grow. ❤️"	Ill_Introduction588	follow-up	na	na	na	0.012577171437442303	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
So I can't find any info on this happening to anyone else, but late last year I had some severe panic attacks and ptsd episodes that were just constant and I was really sick and weak. I would cry and scream a lot. And one time I was scream crying hard , and my hands and face were getting pins and needles which always happens to me during panic attacks. But then the muscles in my hands got tighter and I started freaking out more,  using my last bit of dexterity to tell my mom to come home immediately. And then they completely contracted hand folding over my wrist in a weird lobster position and I couldn't move them at all. Please tell me someone else knows what I mean?

"You would find more info on this if you googled ""symptoms of a panic attack/hyperventilating""

When you're having a panic attack or crying very hard - you end up hyperventilating.

**Hyperventilating means you're gonna exhale too much CO2. You're basically exhaling too much.** 

Your brain and body needs a very specific ratio of Oxygen and CO2 to operate normally. If you exhale too much CO2, you experience the symptoms you described. 

It makes you experience pins and needles tingling, dizziness, nausea and yes your muscles can even contract and fold in on themselves like you described. The folding sounds like an extreme panic attack.

The only way to prevent this is to slow down your breathing, and even hold your breathe in between doing slow breaths. Im so sorry this happened to you, I know it can be so scary!

Yes. This happens to me too..my hands, mouth, fingers and sometimes legs will lock up..only happens if I’m having a severe episode and I’m hyperventilating for a long time. It’s very disorienting.. especially when it happens for the first time. I’m so sorry this is something you struggle with but you’re not alone 🫂 it’s your bodies reaction to the immense stress it’s being put through.

I just wish I could cry. It was shamed and abused out of me at a young age to the point that when I really wish I could cry, I can't force myself to, no matter what.

"Crying hard enough to give you tingling in your extremities followed by a gradual, involuntary tightening of a muscle sounds like the classic cramps that can happen during extreme muscle strain.  

I get them when I vomit, and, on rare occasions, even when I sneeze too hard too many times in a row.  The involuntary tensing and spasms involved in a hard cry could easily be the cause for you.

Make sure you're staying hydrated and getting enough magnesium, potassium, and calcium (which should be in any daily multivitamin), and see a doctor if it persists.  

In the meantime, if it starts to happen again, as soon as you notice them twitching, force them to remain flexed back the opposite way.  (Sit on them, palms down or something.)   If it's a normal muscle cramp, it will twitch feebly a few more times and you'll feel it let go.   (this could be a good experiment to see if it *is* just cramping brought on by strain.)"

Yes, this happens because while hysterical, we most likely hyperventilate, which can cause the face and jaw to contract and feel numb. Hands and toes feel the same and curl up. The diaphragm is also affected, and the muscles tense. It's a horrible experience, but when this happens, I've found that breathing in and out of a paper bag for a short time can help relax the muscles because they are over oxygenated.

I have to deal with my life being maniulated so much with victim intimidation tactics that I have to choose between telling the truth or lying to get things done quickly. This has a significant affect on my job performance. I wrote a whole website and tried to talk to the cops but they don't listen and the truth seems to inspire multilateral intimdation tactics. Speaking out about the intimidation tactics puts me at risk of getting called a liar or banned from public discorse. Then I come across embarrassing situation where the rules arn't written to accomodate me telling the truth.  For instance you notice customers and coworkers acting on material facts to exploit you while the professionals and bosses deny that the material fact exists.

"I apologize, this is kind of long. I hope it can also help some other people who are dealing with the same thing, but nevertheless I apologize for my wordiness.

Hi people. I'm in need of some advice. I'm a woman in my early 20s, heavily institutionalized my whole life which led to me dropping out of high school because I spent more time in mental institutions as a child than at school. This has obviously led to me being severely socially stunted along with a myriad of other handicaps that make leading a ""normal"" life pretty impossible. I do have a boyfriend of nearly two years who is very supportive, and he's the closest I've ever been to another person in my life. He's taught me a lot, how to love, how to be kind, how to trust. But as you all know it's a long and grueling process. 
I'm going to say this bluntly because it's pointless to dance around reality with soft words. I am not a kind person. I'm rude, I'm inpatient, I'm arrogant, I'm incredibly suspicious of everyone and everything, I can easily write people out of my life with little to no emotion (even if they are heavily grieving the loss of our friendship), in general, I *hate* people. I am extremely misanthropic. I learned from a very early age that humans are vile and will do anything to use you for their gain. I learned from a very early age that to continue your existence, it's kill or be killed (either literally or metaphorically). However I wasn't like this at all when I was a child. Even for a while after the horrors of my youth started, I was bubbly, trusting (too trusting), treated absolutely everyone with warmth (especially kids who were being bullied, because I was also being badly bullied), and in general I was optimistic about the world. I would like to learn how to be more like my inner child. She is the sweetest person I know, and she deserved so much better. And she deserves better from me, in the present. She didn't have to think twice about being kind, it was her default. And I speak about her as if she's separate from me, because we are polar opposites. And as I'm completely aware of how shitty I am sometiems, I *want* to be better. It's just so much easier said than done. I beat myself up over how awful I can be sometimes, and I'm aware that I'm the only one who can fix it. I've sought help before, where people just usually get butthurt and say things like ""well why don't you just stop being an asshole and people will like you better."" Yes. I know. But how? I don't actually know how. There isn't much useful information on the internet that actually helps IRL, and trying IRL usually fails for me and I become discouraged. 
I am frustrated with mainstream Internet mental health advocacy because it's all so watered down. And I've noticed with PTSD and trauma in general, there seems to be a focus towards the response of people becoming total people pleasers who let people walk all over them and always force a smile upon their face, and for the reverse, ""people can't let their trauma hurt others, it's their responsibility"", and little else to actually help with that. I don't like being the way I currently am. It doesn't bring me joy or pleasure, it doesn't make me feel important, and if I could turn a switch and be better I'd do it instantly. But that's not how it works. I need to figure it out without a magic switch, and it's a lot of work. Yes I'm in therapy, and I'm in the process of finding someone to do EMDR with. However *please* do not be recommending medication in the comments, or any type of institution either. It will make me angry and upset. I won't respond, I'll just ignore it, but it will deeply upset me and I don't want to have to deal with that right now. I have been severely medically abused my whole childhood and a large portion of my trauma is directly because of how institutionalized I was. If you don't think 1900s style insane asylum shit is still present in some ways today... especially for certain types of people, you're dead wrong.
I think I'm getting too wordy. Anyway, I really truly want to work on my social skills because I don't want to waste my 20s hiding in my apartment with the lights off, windows barricaded, door triple locked, blah blah blah. And I don't want to ruin every job I can get with pissing off the boss and coworkers by being unintentionally rude. I would love to have friends, where I'm both not being a dick, and where we can trust each other, and we can have fun together, and like each other mutually. I want to live in the present, and not constantly obsess about the past that I cannot change. And I want to work through the trauma responses I have that make all these things insanely difficult for me. I'd love some advice from people who have had similar trauma responses as me, and have successfully changed their mindset and worked through their trauma and can now successfully maintain relationships, jobs, and overall have a better quality of life. They always say the abused often becomes abuser. And I probably would if I had kids before working through this extensively (which is why I most certainly will not). I don't think I've ever abused anyone other than getting sweet revenge on my parents a few times which was definitely deserved, and I don't feel bad about it. But I need to move on from this. I can't stand being who I am now. I'm not asking for pity either. I just want to change. It's so daunting. And so much harder than those stupid Instagram infographics make it seem. I'm turning to reddit because there's only so much a general therapist can help with. It'd be nice to hear some first hand experience.

Thanks for reading all the way down, I know this was longer than it needed to be. I'm wordy. Sorry!"	idkmyownname_ohno	post	23.391715335521358	female	White	0.9487013220787048	na	na	na	1	ptsd	no prediction.
People that have been hurt, hurt other people.  I am in no way saying this is the correct response, but I isolate myself so I don't hurt other people.  I don't intend to flip out, but I know it can happen so I just don't bother trying to interact with people.	idkmyownname_ohno	reply	na	na	na	0.9487013220787048	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
hi so this isn't rlly abt ptsd but idk where else to ask this. I'm 16 and had a rlly traumatic childhood from birth to 11, physically abusive parent ect. as much as the ptsd and depression and anxiety and other things one thing that I have to an extreme extent is empathy. I am very empathic but to an extreme event where instead of feeling what someone might feel I feel it myself too. especially with sadness and non physical pain. i also feel i am able to sense precisely what goes on in others lives witbout knowing anytbing about them (and i tent to be accurate abt it). I don't kmow the cause of it if it is linked to the childhood but I'm really curious as to why. I'm not bothered with the therapy bc it's low-key shit in my country unless I'm paying shit tons. so anyone who might know the cause of extreme empathy (to the point where I am hurting) please do let me know anything :). ty	yamacoochi	post	28.406033657037014	female	White	0.0036477406974881887	na	na	na	4	ptsd	no prediction.

I'm 17 and I don't know if this helps, but I am this way too. You are not alone in this feeling. It is a large part of my PTSD, becuase I don't want anyone to feel the ways I've felt (survivor of sexual, domestic, physical, and emotional abuse). You probably don't want others to feel hurt of bad in anyway becuase you know that pain, and therefore feel it. The only reason I am alive today is because someone with your kind of empathy was able to help me.

"Hey everyone, 
I'm reaching out for help from those who have gone through similar experiences and people with life experience.
Four years ago, I went through a situation involving sexual violence. I won't go into too much detail to protect myself and others. However, the person who hurt me took advantage of their power over me. They took my virginity, and because I couldn't accept what happened and was overwhelmed, I ended up getting into a relationship with them. This relationship was short, but it involved more instances where my boundaries were violated. And yes, I understand that I share some responsibility for the subsequent experiences. But at the time, I was overwhelmed, young, and inexperienced, so I didn't really know what was considered normal and what wasn't. I thought I could somehow fix the terrible experience by being in that relationship.
I kept all of this hidden for a long time. It was only a year ago that I gathered the courage to see a trauma therapist, which turned out to be the best decision I've made. The therapist is wonderful. I'm deeply involved in the process of addressing these issues. It's been only 7 months since I've truly come to understand what I went through, what it actually was. This is really affecting me emotionally. I have to come to terms with a painful truth about myself – that someone harmed me and my body, and as a result, I'm dealing with trauma. Accepting all of this has been very difficult for me. I feel extremely alone when it comes to dealing with this matter. Even though I'm 22 years old and should be able to handle such things, I find myself struggling to do so. I'm overwhelmed by it all. Questions about my identity keep bothering me: Who am I, and to what extent is my trauma a part of me? I feel really desperate, always seeking ways to heal more. I'm wondering why the pain and difficulty of dealing with what happened have become so intense after all these years. Why now? And on top of everything, I'm in my twenties, which is already a challenging time for self-discovery. I'm constantly asking myself: How can I heal further? Who should I talk to for advice – perhaps a pastor, other therapists, counselors, or people who've been through similar experiences? Are there any books I should read? What about exercises or strategies for healing?
For now, I can't bring myself to talk about this with my loved ones. Only my partner knows about it. But I find it easier to talk about with people I don't know well. So, I'm curious – how have you managed to cope with this kind of situation, and what steps did you take during your healing process?

(English is not my first language)

Your experience sounds similar to mine. Raped at 14 as a virgin. Then didn’t know how to fix it or process it so I thought if I was his girlfriend it would make it better somehow. Refused his sexual advances and he was gone, but put out the word that I was a slut. Humiliated. Didn’t speak about it to anyone for 25 years. Trauma is real and long lasting.

"I am a guy and haven't experienced the very same trauma you did, but I dealt with PTSD both due to domestic abuse as well as experiences I made while I was serving as a first responder. So I know the entire thing about zoning out, losing the sense of self and all of the other stuff that falls under ""survival mode"". So let me try to help:

First of all, understand that your partner is **not** your psychologist! It is great to have someone who supports you, but you really need to seek professional help. I do not want to scare you, but despite doing the best I could to get professional help, I had ex girlfriends turn their back on me. I'm not going to get into the issue of betrayal and how fair or unfair those decisions were, but people crack easily under the burden people like us can seem. Note the word: Seem. We are just perfectly fine, lovable people - yet many people nowadays can only handle so much. So take it from me and ""unload"" everything onto someone who is not your spouse, but trained to help.

What might suck to hear, too: The healing never really stops. When I think of traumatic events during my service, those memories still haunt me after almost 17 years. This is when you need to engage with yourself through kindness and compassion: Don't blame yourself and don't dwell too long on obsessive thoughts like those ""What if I had....? Would things be different today?"" kind of thoughts. Rumination was a big one for me, and it took me years to get that under control.

Also consider EMDR - it's horrible to relive memories, but through EMDR I learned how to unwrap that compartmentalised mess in my head and sorted out things I simply had to sort out. Professionals can guide you."	Angel22087	reply	na	na	na	0.003165419213473797	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"I'm so sorry this happened to you. I never dealt with my rape and other traumas for 10-20 years, so I unfortunately had a major extended mental health crisis that landed me in the hospital recently and a high level of care. I actually didn't know I had PTSD until this recent diagnosis, but so many things make sense now that I've been learning about it. 

I don't have a resolution for you as I'm still in an intensive outpatient program and unable to work at the moment. The goal is to get me functional and stable in everyday life and reach a point where it is safe for me to do trauma processing. I'm working towards being stable to try EMDR therapy. It has had a lot of success but is very intense. My PCP was the one who helped me find a program to help me. I wish you the best in your journey."

"I’ve been the victim of rape and other forms of sexual violence several times. I’m about to start EMDR but that took many years to get to a position where I was ready to do that. I will admit I didn’t always cope very well and some of my coping mechanisms were downright harmful, so I won’t recommend any of those. Something that helped me come a long way that was admittedly hard but really helped was revisiting a couple of the sites of my abuse and having full control over myself and what I did there. Creating a new memory in that place where I was in control and no one could hurt me anymore.

Developing healthy sexual relationships with partners who I could trust was also very integral in my healing. I’m married now and although sex has sometimes been triggering there’s been a process of re-learning that if I say no nothing is going to happen to me and he’s going to respect it.

It is a really difficult process and I wish you all the best and trust me things do get easier ❤️"	Angel22087	reply	na	na	na	0.003165419213473797	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"I'm in a really similar boat! I was 14 when it happened and 22 now, and I juuuust started therapy within the last few months. In some ways, my entire world has come crashing down because of my diagnosis... I can look back through my high school and college years and realize only now that I had PTSD the whole time. It's like the last 8 years of my life were just me repressing and burying my feelings, and now they are coming out.

I felt very responsible for what was done to me, like you do, and I have a few things that I've heard in therapy that really resonated with me and changed my view on the incident. 

1. ""The shame is not yours to carry."" The shame of what that person did to you falls on them and only on them. You do not need to feel shame because of someone else's horrific behavior. Also, do some reading/watching on the topic of ""shame versus guilt"". Many rape victims deal with shame which is not something that anyone should experience.

2. ""You made the choices you made because you were trying to get your needs met."" What was it that you needed at the time? For me, my parents were emotionally neglectful. I had perfect grades and was doing really well with extracurriculars, but never received praise or appreciation from my parents. This led me to seek this out elsewhere, which manifested into grooming by adult men.

3. What happened was rape/sexual violence. When I talk to people about my abuse, I say ""when I was having sex with him.."" or ""the abuse that I went through."" I skirt around that ""R"" word because I don't feel like what happened to me was bad enough to be called rape. But it was! I'm working on changing my language around what I went through to more accurately reflect it and not diminish it anymore. It happened, it was a horrible thing, and now I can start to heal.


Good on you for seeking help, OP. It's not easy and it honestly gets worse before it gets better. But we'll get there."	Angel22087	reply	na	na	na	0.003165419213473797	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"The man abused his power over you, raped you several times, and stepped over your boundaries. How do you carry some of blame? It's all his fault. You're a victim.

I understand, really, I was a virgin when the man raped me. I didn't realize it was rape, especially since I blamed myself a lot because I was drunk, I even went to his house the following day just to convince myself that it wasn't rape. Well... it didn't. I spent almost a decade avoiding the subject since it is so hurtful for me. I never felt sad or angry for myself for what happened till after 8 years had passed and 5 years of therapy. 

The thing is, you don't need to reduce your life to being a victim or a survivor. You can't go back in time and make that not happen, but you can create tools to heal and move on. What happened to us is part of our story, just like other major events do. Better than looking for ways to heal on the outside, I think it's better to look inwards, be kind to yourself, soothe yourself, and use the tools you have to move on."

"So proud of you for finding a trauma therapist and confronting these issues, it's very far from easy. I don't think you are to 'blame' for anything that was perpetrated against you. That was 100% the other person's choice and it sounds like you were coping with it the best you knew how. Sometimes these things come to the surface when you're out of immediate danger and have a chance to reflect, but that's just one of several theories!

There are many, many kinds of approaches for trauma and I don't think it's a one size fits all. Some of the common approaches in my country are medication (especially if you struggle with debilitating nightmares and panic attacks), STAR therapy, mindfulness and self compassion and emotional management. There's also really fun stuff like art and music therapy! Maybe your therapist can give you some suggestions? Best of luck, my thoughts are with you."

Similar experience. Unfortunately when we are underaged we don’t have the tools and understanding of what happened and it’s harder to heal because of it.

"It happened something similar to me.
I had a long relationship with someone who I met when I was very drunk and he was abusing from my lack of consciousness. 
At the time I was feeling very lonely, and all my friends had a couple and he was into me so I accepted him into my life even the big red flags.
My first sexual experiences where kind of confusing and only me trying to rapidly please him cause I didn’t really wanted to be with him, but I had such a low self steem and somehow I used to feel he used to understand me and I felt glad I had someone who accepted me the way I am. I mean i could be myself with him and he wasn’t leaving me, which meant a lot to me cause I have abandonment trauma.
I kept having horrible relationships after him, just repeating the same patterns, until a guy actually raped me, and then I realized all of this, this was some months ago, and I’ve been feeling so alone, I hate I’m not even able to get horny anymore and when I try to have sex with people I actually like, my body has trauma reaction and it all tenses. It’s embarrassing not to have the control of my own body. It’s weird cause I’m a very horny person so I’m always thinking about sex but my body just can’t deal with it cause all the times I made myself have sex with someone I didn’t want to and because the time I was raped.

Can say with work such as journal writing exercise finding things you enjoy and support it can get better. I used better help.

Don’t blame yourself for whatever happened when you were in that relationship. You might convince yourself it’s your fault because you dated them after the first traumatic experience but it’s never your fault. They’re the one who abused you. I’m not a victim of what you went through but I’ve known a couple people who have and the best coping strategy I can remember them mentioning is definitely therapy, as well as finding your own unique way to heal.

"I don't think I've ever been genuinely diagnosed with PTSD. I have had anxiety attacks due to years worth of sexual assault and I've become very aware of my surrounds as well as I'm a very hypersexual person despite being extra cautious when I walk alone and when I'm near men

But besides that recently, July 17th of this year I had decided to get high with my older sister which resulted in a terrible reaction. I only remember snippets of that night but I still can hear myself screaming and pleaing and sometimes even see and feel the way my body did that day. Apparently I went through marijuana induced psychosis and goodness me it was the most terrifying thing I've ever been through. My sister was so concerned about getting introuble it took for me to scream for hours in pain and fear for people near by to call the police. I had cuts and bruises from my desperate atrempts to be able to feel something because in that moment I thought I had just made an irreversible mistake. I was in this way for at least 7 to 10 hours since I wasnt given an IV to help flush out my system better since my family assumed I was being dramaic. They didn't take blood or ask me to pee in a cup. Nor did they do a CT scan to make sure I didn't sustain a brain injury at all. Just the idea that if I wasn't at least somewhat aware of my surroundings I could've gotten myself killed is truly terrifying. I've told friends about my experience and the first thing they do is laugh. I laugh with them but the more I think about the more I feel how could that be funny?

A few weeks ago I had my first severe panic attack. I thought that day I was going through exactly what I went through when I was high. Now ever since that day I've developed severe anxiety and I feel like I may have developed some PTSD with it. I fear everyday I'll have a reaction like that day again and I'm constantly thinking about it. I can hear and see clearly that night in my head. My voice is exactly the same it was when I was begging for my sister to call someone and just begging and screaming for help because I had no idea what was going on with me. But at the same time I feel stupid for even wanting to see if PTSD is a possibility since I did this to myself. But is there a chance I may have developed it? I'm starting intensive out patient care tomorrow so I'll definitely discuss it with my therapist. But what do you guys think?"

"I'm trying to find out what's wrong with me.  Over the last 8 months, I've been experiencing cognitive impairment.  At its worst it feels like dimensia.  At times, it feels like I've acquired ADD or dyslexia.  If I try to do a task, I literally won't see certain details.  I'll leave and come back and still not see it.  Then something happens (usually a mistake) and then I'll finally see it.  It's like I have blind spots in my vision.  Also blind spots in my memory.  I have a hard time remembering things.  I can't visualize things anymore or remember what I'm reading in a book.  I've lost 2 jobs because of my acquired incompetence, and I'm desperately holding onto the one I have by working twice as hard.  I feel like I've lost 40 IQ points.

I feel this, i was diagnosed with dyslexia in my teen years and once my PTSD surfaced the add really kicked in. For me it was all about mindfulness. The most difficult part is recognizing that it’s manifested. The rest is just practice. PTSD seems to stir the mind making it hard to focus, and it can feel like a severe case of ADD. It’s okay, it’s hard now but it will get easier. Breathing helps me focus. Also, counseling can be very helpful in learning, mindfulness, and learning how to step back and “ know were your feet are”. I’m not an expert but I hope this help with perspective.	MadeBale	reply	na	na	na	0.997856080532074	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"I remember being so afraid of my loved ones dying or something else happening to them, especially my mom, ever since I was little.

Now I've discovered that many of them contributed to my trauma (I guess all families traumatize you somehow) but I'm still so afraid of them dying somehow in a way that I can't save them.

It terrifies me. I get intrusive thoughts and images in my mind of the worst things happening to them that leave me reeling for a moment.

I don't know how to make them stop and why they happen. I've never really witnessed with my eyes anything that horrible happening to anyone (except for a stint of seeing tons of gore videos when I was a teen desperately trying to prove I'm not ""soft"").

I think I live in a state of fear from it.

I am starting to awaken to the truth and to see it more clearly that I have one life, and that it is my precious life, and they’ve already taken away so much of it, and why should I hold a candle for the very people that caused it?

This is the fear of loss of those we love. It is the greatest price we pay to feel true love and it's worth it.  One of the best ways to live is to remember to do things now and not have regret.  Drop everything and meet them now, call them now, hug them now, let them know how you feel now.  It's a sweet way to live your life really. Always grateful for this day."

From what I hear, that's actually very common. You somehow keep going while you're still in troubled waters and when you're finally save, it breaks out of you. There's nothing regressive about it, the way I see it. It's more of a letting go of a very hard shell that kept you alive but was ultimately suffocating you. Once its gone, all the pain starts pouring out and it takes a while to feel like there is any progress at all. But its part of processing what happend and a safe and loving environment is the most important thing in getting better.

A lot of places put all their court records online on official government websites that anyone can look at for free these days. You can probably find the relevant ones by googling “(whatever county) court records”. The results might not be super clear or informative, you probably won’t find court transcripts or anything but it might be more like a list of dates that various court/legal things happened on and you can often see what crimes someone has been convicted of.

Yeah, that right there is messed up. My instructor on a base I stayed on with him and trained under beat his wife one day, lied to me about his prescription drug abuse, was neglecting his daughter and gas lighting/manipulating me and his wife all the same. I got out after a few months. I reported all of this to the MP and Child protective services before I left. He ended up beating his child and nearly killing his wife after I left. He killed himself shortly after facing federal charges, justice given as I had prayed for, for he could not live with himself finally. I live with regret every day still that I left the wife and the child in his treacherous path. He was called a hero by his mother and friends (Special Forces Soldier), made me sick and enraged. All I have to say about that as I understand only a fraction of a degree of what you must have gone through having also listened to countless rape survivors and domestic violence survivors. I am so sorry, be encouraged that healing comes in part from victory in knowing that you now have a choice, a very difficult, but time, help from loved ones and professional help will help along the way immensely.

20f, history of domestic abuse and sexual abuse
I get triggered when something of my past is brought up in any way. 
When people leave me, reject me, fear of it. When people use me or lead me on. When anything is mentioned that leads to a chain of thoughts and flashbacks, whatever it may be, it sends me into a spiral.
When I’m triggered I get depressed, but I also get super hypersexual, and super impulsive 
Tattooing myself, shaving my head, sleeping with many men, meeting strangers from the internet, hookup sites, alcohol etc

And sometimes I’m aware of it, the choices I make. But sometimes I’m not. 
And right now I’ve been triggered - multiple times the past week but especially now - and im feeling it coming again. 

I want to meet random men and have sex, simple as. I want to get blackout drunk and take a walk outside and sleep on the grass under the stars. I want to do something risky something different, something fun.

And I’m not just worried about now. I’m leaving my apartment in two weeks, Ima be in a temp housing where I won’t want to be living, so I’ll be outside as much as possible. What if I do something stupid without thinking? 

I’m so scared of what I’m like when I go on that autopilot.

I highly suggest connecting with a local DV/ SA nonprofit. They may be able to connect you with resources that may help, such as low cost/ no cost therapy and safe places to live.

"I can relate to a degree. I have had patterns where I would do literally anything to distract myself from my trauma... using substances, sleeping around, traveling to different countries on a whim, spending every last dollar that I had... basically being reckless/self-destructive. 

It turned out to be hypomania, for me, which is like a ""high"" that causes you to act like you're indestructible, and engage in reckless behavior. 

If your psychiatrist isn't taking this seriously, I'd really suggest seeing a different one -- it's important that you can stabilize and have some resources, either meds or other strategies, to stop the cycle when it begins.

I feel you, I'm so sorry you're going through this. I was 16 when I started being super hypersexual, now I'm 21(f) and I'm scared of sex but I'm still having urges to do crazy shit. Drinking is a big one whenever I drink I want to bawl about my trauma and then kill myself or literally just run away. I also have a passion for traveling which I definitely let myself use to justify me driving across the country without sleeping and racking up my credit card on gas, when I do sleep I sleep in my car in truck stops and stuff, honestly I still cant see how it's that bad but my T says its dangerous lol. It's fun to me and I'll do anything to run from the trauma! I shaved my head 6 months ago and loved it so of you havent done it yet its definitely not the worst impulsive thing you can do, made me feel so alive.

TW: rape
  

  
I am an Indian boy, less than 18 BTW(don't wanna be specific), I live in Kuwait and my parents aren't wealthy or anything. I have a brother(5 yrs older) When I was a kid I was raped by him IT was 2013-14 I was about 7 back then, I was unaware of what was going on and went along this happened on weekends for a month until I mom came out her room in the afternoon and caught us and interrogated me but I said it's nothing and I was told not to say anything by my brother. That was when he stopped
  

  
Fast forward a couple years it's 2017 he leaves Kuwait and goes to India for studies, we both use to get good grades but even since I was raped my grades dropped and I got insomnia and tons of health issues. He gots good grades in India and then fell into depression and sort of drop out.
  

  
2019-He became a weird person got an attitude I guess and Became self centered and aggressive. We went to India for Vacation and decided that he'd come back and do studies here, in 2020 covid hit I was locked in and I felt uncomfortable for some reason, I developed OCD. I Clean myself alot if I touch his things or anything about him makes me uncomfortable. He was told me teach me maths cause I was struggling but he did nothing and got paid by my parents LMFAO. 2021 may I distant myself from him and my parents didn't like it and told me to interact with him. I told my mom everything in Oct of 2021 and the first thing she did was laugh(probably because I was talking about sexual abuse and shit and we Indians Don't talk about it). I cried, she told me she'd be here for me and to talk to her if i need her ( she did nothing even when I asked for comfort a week later lol wtf). I told her to tell my dad for her as well and she said alright and she also told me that he was raped when he was 12 or something by dad's coworker without dad knowing and during 2019 he told mom and my aunt in Australia (She's important for later).
  

  
My parents said this thing is normal and all siblings do it and I shouldn't worry and then they said ""don't tell anyone"". I told a few trust worthy friends who and really good but I feel myself withdrawal away from everyone. 2022 we went to India and I was gonna tell my uncle in India about it( he helped us alot this year and back in 2019 he's amazing). But I couldn't muster up the courage. 2023 July we go meet him again but only live with him for 3 days as and dad has me take care of my grandfather who is really sick and might not live long. So I couldn't tell him again.
  

  
I come back from India and I hate it here. I have Vacation but my brother doesn't so he goes to collage and I interrogated my mom and got her to confess
  

  
She believes that I was raped but my parents don't want to contact the police because ""90% students and people do it"" and ""we should just forget nothing we can do, police won't help"" She gaslight me and I hate it, feels like she takes Out her anger on me with verbal abuse no swearing or anything. But guess what, this time I recorded everything 6:34 seconds worth of voice recording These monsters don't give one crap about there sons rape or my tears. I left the room and pause the recording saved it, she told me to come back but I didn't saving the recording was top priority. She came to the living room after a minute and said ""what happened to you happened to your brother"" my dad doesn't know my brother was raped.
  

  
I told my dad ages ago I will go to Australia after grade 12th CBSE Board exams and I have about 8 months left. I haven't done anything with the recordings yet but I have backups
  

  
I told my mom me and my brother need to be separated and this entire thing is causing me problems she said "" just forget it's normal"" Once I go to Australia I'm gonna go no contact obviously. Maybe even leak the recordings and let them burn in hell. I'm currently practicing IELTS but when I told my mom that she has to separate us she said "" we can go to India after 12th you and me"" and I said I'm going to Australia and she replied ""i cant come there"" but i didnt care and i said i will.
  

  
Today about 30mins before dinner we had an argument when everyone was home but didnt listen. Basically woke up early and studied for IELTS but she doesnt know what that is and asked will u get full marks in board exam and I basically replied I will get good grades and go to Australia, and she got angry and was like "" dad doesn't have 25 lakhs rupees you will stay""
  

  
And she spoke over me and didn't even shut the fuck up when I spoke over her. I can live with my aunt in Australia she knows my brother was raped
  
But doesn't know about my condition and she asks about my future after 12th( she will happily accept me in Australia and I trust her family they are cool like my uncle in india). I was thinking about sending the recording to my uncle in India tomorrow morning but I've been saying that for like 2 weeks. Idk what to do, will I even be out of this hell hole by next year. When I ask my dad about going to Australia he says "" there is no need to write an exam and we'll see later"" and just funking nods his head.
  

  
The reason I'm being told to be quiet is probably( or according to my logic) because if everyone found out then there's goes his reputation, Noone will like them, brother will not get a job or marriage, so no grandkids and he won't get my brother's salary for his retirement( that's the reason we were born, to take care of these idiots) and since there's only 2 of us, only I remain to take care of them with is not ideal since 2 is greater than 1 I guess.

It's getting harder and harder to see that light at the end of the tunnel. Every time I take a step forward, it feels like the path gets 3 steps longer. I'm so exhausted all the time. I don't know if I can keep doing this but if I stop trying then that's it for me. I'm so stressed and depressed I'm probably gonna put myself in an early grave. I just don't see why I'm trying anymore, I don't see the end to this and I dont see how it can get better. I've been fighting against myself and the world my whole life, despite everything I'm still trying to be in a better place but I feel like I have nothing to show for it. I feel just as lost as I always have. If there's gonna be any progress for me, it'll probably be long in the future when I'm about to die and when I think of that, I just don't see the point of trying at all. I'm tired of hurting and I'm tired of hurting the ones I love. I'm so unbelievably exhausted.	TheAirStinks	post	11.863674921317623	male	White	0.9993031024932861	na	na	na	5	ptsd	failed

I've pushed everyone away. The tiniest things someone does can trigger me. Nervous system can't take it and my poor loved ones can do no right. 

Therapy (more than one type: Somatic, Equine, Psychoanalysis, Multichannel integrational eye something) has helped. Has helped a lot.  It's too bad therapy is only once a week though and healing takes time.

Same. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed with the same symptoms bothering me day after day, it feels like I never get a break. I do have goals, but not big ones. It may be to get through the day, to still be breathing at the end of the week. You're still breathing, despite what you've been through. That may be small, but it's showing you're developing resilience. That's progress. It helps to remember the small things that you overcame. You got out of bed, you're reaching out for help,etc .

"I hear you and I feel you. I’m late 30’s. For me, I’ve been there due to alcoholism, anxiety, and depression. I developed severe liver disease. I stopped drinking and I got back into exercising. I have two kids, and although they live out of state, a core motivation I have is to be there for them as long as possible. My son has slight ASD and I want to make sure he will be alright for as long as I can. My daughter too.

Would I have found another motivation if I did not have kids? I definitely believe I would have, and do. The truth is that depression is at the root of it all. It is a chronic chemical imbalance of dopamine and serotonin levels in the brain. An easy way to prove this? If you didn’t have this imbalance, you’d feel great. You’d be naturally motivated with your life drive restored. The brain and serotonin and dopamine and oxytocin all have an overwhelming - even manipulative - effect on our emotions and behavior. We are not really in total control. 

I’d recommend seeing a psychiatrist and getting on meds. Worked for me."	TheAirStinks	reply	na	na	na	0.9993031024932861	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
"Hey..
I got abused when I was about 11 years old.(24 years now). In the past few years i've got extrem debilitating flashbacks. Like pictures in my head but also physical flashbacks (touches etc). Today I had extrem body flashbacks, I thought I'm getting abused again. I could feel him laying on me, kissing me, touching me. After a while it got over, but then I realised I was bleeding, like when I got abused. Im sure it's not because I'm getting my period, because I have them only 2-3 times a year and had them in May. Also it didn't feel like my period. I know I didn't got abused, because I'm at closed ward and was alone in the room, no chance my abuser could get there.

I don't know anything about your situation, but I also have night terrors quite frequently. For me, they got better with time, but I still do have them. One thing that I found that helps reduce night terrors is have some sort of comfort routine before going to bed. This could be anything from being with a significant other or watching your favorite TV show. I personally just listen to calming music and noises. If you want professional help with this, I'd recommend finding cognitive behavioral therapy near you.	idklol123123132	reply	na	na	na	0.9985880255699158	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

"For context, I'm 19 and autistic + anxiety + ADHD, while my mum is 51 with PTSD + anxiety + ADHD. My mum has PTSD specifically from verbal abuse in her childhood + being taken advantage of as a young adult. A couple of years ago there was an incident where one of the jobs she worked at she ended up getting triggered, eventually ending up in a psychosis and going to hospital. During this process I stayed at my grandparents place but all the yelling and strange behaviour (like ringing me over and over while at my grandparents to make sure I'm okay, just strangely overprotective behaviour) has never left me and now anytime she does anything out of the ordinary I freeze up and feel like I'm going to cry.

For a few years everything was fine, but something recently has happened again. She's been extremely stressed by work, as she has a tendency of not being able to speak up and just takes all the shifts she can get. She's been really on edge and overprotective again, and while I don't think it'll lead to a psychosis again it just scares me. She's normally such a cheerful person but when I try to have a conversation with her now she's really blunt and just stares off into the distance. And me being autistic, I get overwhelmed by changes easily. She's the only person I've ever trusted so when she says she's okay what am I supposed to do? I'm staying at my grandparents tonight but idk what I'll do next.

I've thought more and more recently about wanting to move out, but even if that was financially possible (which it's not) I'm just not capable of living by myself yet. I can barely cook and mum does a lot of the chores usually, even when I insist she let me try. And even so, if I just left I'd feel like I'm abandoning her. Neither of us are financially stable enough to live on our own and I don't know how she'd react if I just left. But mentally I feel like I'm suffering when I'm around her like this? I just want to cry constantly cause it's all so overwhelming. I just don't know what on earth to do anymore."

Following an argument with my bf, i started getting intense flashbacks of my abusive past and childhood. Ended up crying myself to sleep. I feel heavy in my chest today.

A big part of me is numb while my chest continues to feel like it’s sinking. Can anyone else tell me what’s happening.

It's pretty common to have these feelings in your body, after severe stress. I've gone through phases of uncontrollable crying for days, and ended up with angina, which is the heart-attack feeling where your heart isn't getting enough blood flow.

"I hope I did the title correctly. To make a long story short, when I was 14 I was raped by my boyfriend who was also 14 (we had a long history of a toxic relationship). I reported it to the authorities and to make another long story short the police and the investigation ruined my life and my whole school found out.  

For 10 years I felt pretty numb and apathetic towards the whole thing. I had no feelings about it. I remember even lying to the counselor my mom set me up with when I was a teenager telling her I felt ashamed because I thought i was supposed to feel some kind of way but I never did. Fast forward 10 years I started having dreams about this boyfriend where I would feel, something, within the brief moments of waking up but it would quickly vanish and I wouldn't be able to summon the emotion back to work through it at all. These dreams were troubling but they weren't frequent enough to really alter my level of functioning at all. 

Now two years after that and this past month things feel like they are very suddenly crashing down on me and I am feeling these things. Like really feeling a lot of pain and sadness. The other night I had this flashback where I was in the room that it happened, feeling the purple fabric between my fingers and seeing the paint on the walls. I knew where I was and why I was there. I had another flashback today. It's been about two weeks I would say since I feel like this got really bad out of nowhere. I can't identify anything in particular that triggered it. I have developed anxiety and the other day I got so worked up thinking that I was going to see this person at the grocery store which is a really unfounded, irrational fear (I haven't seen him since 2015). I'm on summer break from school and I can't imagine how I'm going to do school if this continues. I have two toddlers and I'm struggling to manage i feel like this hit me like a train. I messaged a therapist today who specializes in trauma to see if she's taking new clients. I am terrified of getting therapy and delving into this but I don't see another option. I don't really know what the point of this post is. I guess maybe I just wanna feel less alone.

"I'm so sorry! I experienced something similar, with a trauma from when I was 20. I was numb at the time, and I did go through a lot of negative symptoms at the time (drinking, making questionable life choices, etc.), but I stayed busy and distracted myself from ever processing what happened. 

A whole decade later, when I was 30, it re-surfaced because of a movie I watched. I spent a month crying uncontrollably and didn't leave the house. I realized it was PTSD, and a lot of more subtle issues in my life started to make sense... but it was so strange that it took so long, for me to get to that point of finally feeling something.

You're definitely not alone. Getting therapy can be hard, but even just a few sessions can help give you some direction on how to handle everything. It takes time to heal, just like it took time for you to feel the effects of your trauma. Also, keep in mind that PTSD symptoms often become more visible when your life is stable and healthy. That's when your body and brain feel safe enough to start processing the old memories. Even though it's rough right now, your subconscious has been holding onto this for a long time, so it's kind of a silver lining that healing can finally happen.

A life fully loaded with trauma. Fought to survive with everything I had and almost lost that fight many times. Didn't believe I was going to make it to 20 years old. Well, here I am at 25, and I don't remember why I even fought so hard. Whatever conviction or determination to see better days is gone now. Replaced by exhaustion, nightmares, and a defeated mind. I don't want to hurt myself, but I wouldn't mind laying here until I just waste away. Was surviving worth it? I arguably have a better life now, but I can't use it or appreciate it like I should. I used to think that there was some good reason I didn't pass away a long time ago when I should have. But was it simply to continue suffering more abuse and trauma, as I have? Is there some point to this cavernous well of anguish? Some lesson I needed to learn? Where is my will to live and why is it gone now? Congratulations father, you finally broke my mind for good.

There is something that I like to call spiral of traumas. We become vulnerable , we become the prey always and our decisions become cloudy and based on our trauma.That’s why u will se that people like us, with this condition, have a very messy life, with not one but plenty of traumas one after the other.One loss after the other always losing never wining. It really feels like it will never end. I know how u feel, it’s absolutely exhausting and I feel the same about just waiting to die.

"First, I'd like to preface that I have not been diagnosed with PTSD, and I have a strong feeling that I don't have it because I don't experience flashbacks, nightmares, and most ptsd symptoms. But I have a question regarding dreams that may be related to my trauma that I'm hoping someone can answer.

Lately, I've noticed I've been having dreams where my abuser is present in them. I don't have dreams replaying what I've been through. For example, I'll have a dream where I'm back in high school, or in a public place, and my abuser will be there, usually their face is blurred out or I'm looking away but I can tell they're in the corner of my eye. The reason why I call them dreams instead of nightmares is because they don't really feel like nightmares to me?? The second I notice them, I look away and keep walking, and suddenly the dream changes to me at the mall. I feel a slight sense of fear and dread knowing they're there, but once I wake up, that feeling goes away because oh, it was just a dream. I don't wake up anxious or sweating. Thankfully I don't get these dreams often, but it's got me concerned about whether this means something and it will hopefully pass, or something more serious such as a symptom of ptsd."

"I don’t even know what caused me to be so triggered personally. But I’m on Day 3 with very minimal sleep (4hrs per night). I did try to talk to my ex about it. He made some very off color jokes related to causal events. I tried to fire back some comebacks but it didn’t play out. 

Then somebody close to me told me they had some really bad medical emergencies related to their own depression/PTSD. They did try to unalive themself as well. 

I’m absolutely devastated. I’m trying to figure out how I can get to them and help them since they live kind of far away.

 At one of my last jobs I was at my worst with PTSD and couldn't function because of severe dissociation. Everyone talked to me like a child and called me ""slow"". One time I was standing by the register, then I blinked and was standing at the other side of the room being yelled at and called stupid. ""How can you not remember? You litteraly just did it!""
Oh, and introducing myself to someone multiple times within minutes because I couldn't remember talking to them.

"I'm experiencing the same thing. Worse. I was bullied for several years and had a total meltdown. The PTSD symptoms are really severe- loss of smell, totally warped mind, inability to remember stuff, incredible mood swings, and I legit am lucky I am getting work done.

The bosses who allowed this and keep me around - I NEVER, EVER experienced such inept people as leaders. Total inability to assess the situation even at a level where they see I'm completely out of it - nope, they add workload, give me to a bigger/more serious client, they give me a raise. And I'm most definitely in a completely DESTROYED mental state caused by bullying that lasted like 2-2,5 years.

My father works with this group kinda, he's a CEO, and others due to how bad I am see me as almost a ""dipshit cokehead son"" from Horrible bosses. Like I'm well aware people see me as a weirdo, somewhat of a nutcase, a doofus, like you write ""slow"", they talk to me like I'm a child.

I am amazed by the behavior, because if I was at my normal state, I'd see there's something really wrong with someone like me. I would know it. But others don't give it any thought and just subconsciously adjust their behavior to suit my momentary state. I find it really weird, almost obtuse, like how the fuck do you not see this previously normal adult human being has something bad going on?

It really sucks I know I'm seen as someone dumb, weird, slow even by people who otherwise I know for a fact aren't exactly fast themselves, or rather definitely not faster than me. And my state is so severe and the people here know me so long and some want to see me fail so much...this is hurting my overall reputation in a broader social circle, even in my family - my father has ZERO clue what's going on, he is not able to understand things like this, so he things I'm just ""turning out as a disappointment"", he has no idea what's really going on and even if I explain it to him, he doesn't believe me, becaue he just doesn't get it.

Almost a week ago my twins had their tonsils and Adenoids removed. That day was pure hell on them and on me also. Seeing the in the PACU brought me right back to the day they were born. For context they were born 2 months early, high risk in peak covid time 2020 to be exact. I never got to see them immediately, they were rushed to the NICU full of tubes/wires/machines etc. Last Tuesday brought that all back, seeing them hooked up to all the wires the iv, the oxygen, the beeping of the machines. Just absolutely destroyed me inside. I broke down too many times. My smallest had a harder time waking up which made it even worse. I imagined I would lose them both. Im in therapy & ptsd treatment but that day was way too much. Im still feeling the flashbacks today. I guess I just needed to get it off my chest before I go crazy. They are doing much better & are home but it still haunts me to this day.	kimbersmom2020	post	35.782111678071324	male	White	0.014639036729931831	na	na	na	4	ptsd	no prediction.

I'm sorry you had a flashback, they are the worst. I had some flashbacks from a sleep study my son did at the hospital a couple months back to look at some leg jerks he was having sleeping. He'd had very severe infantile spasms as a baby and a major brain surgery to stop his epilepsy as an 8 year old and it brought back a lot of fear just being there overnight with him in the hospital.

"tw for school shooting talk. 

campus changed afterwards.

i had just taken a chemistry exam. I saw the words ""run, hide, fight"" projected up inside the exam hall. I had no idea what that meant, but knew it wasn't good. It was 8:34 pm. I left the exam room, and saw I had a LOT of text messages. My friends were warning me to not take the bus to the chipotle on campus because there was an active school shooter on campus. 

I had an active shooter alert on my email. we were instructed to shelter in place. I obliged, but ended up being the last one in the entire exam hall building. it was pitch black outside but i walked to a nearby hall because I was scared and wanted to hide with people. 

fast forward, i make it to the building, and office staff pull me into their office. I'm hiding in a tiny office bathroom with around 10 girls and one gym rat guy. the girls are crying on and off ... so am i. We are all listening to the police radar and giving each other updates. 

we hear the victim count increase. we hear someone (didn't know who it was at the time, still not sure, but i think swat?) making a lot of noise and yell ""put your hands up"" followed by loud whimpering. I literally thought I was going to die then because I thought that was the shooter. not even fucking kidding. 

we were dead silent after that.

then the police radar says that there are explosives planted all around the building i am hiding in. i wanted to puke. i have never heard so many people legitimately sigh in horror before. (it ended up being not true but the way they said it sounded like it was a factual statement)

i didnt really breakdown until at midnight, (we were still in lockdown then in the dark) a girl went ""Oh... guys: it's the 5 year anniversary of the parkland shooting."" That's when I started crying a lot...because I understood what was going on exactly. 

I wished them a happy valentines day. we mournfully laughed. 

I don't know who any of them were, they were all friends with each other, but I hope they are doing well. a girl after, told me she blacked out during it because she was so scared. 

theres a lot i left out in this post of course, but it feels good to have somewhere to talk about this. it is like a swear to talk about in my friend circle. 

It's been 6 months and I can talk about it now. Still can't google anything about it or read articles, but maybe in some years...

so much happened afterwards. we had a week of school off, I didn't have a place to go since my family wasn't in the country, I stayed at an old friend's dorm for the night, I heard police making an interesting joke lol, 

either way, I am happy at least with the progress I have made in dealing with this. I am also proud I did not relapse the weeks after the shooting. 

stay strong everyone.

"TW: assault / childhood / abuse / neglect / etc.

———-

Hi, before I get into this I’ll just say I’m 19. I recently got stable housing around Freshmen year of high-school, 5 and soon to be 6 years ago. I’ve known since I was young that I grew up bad. I can’t remember a lot of my childhood that wasn’t me being abused, making mistakes, etc. up until the height of the pandemic. So, I can only really recount the last few years of my life *alright* as I do face memory issues still.
Anyways, I believe the change in environment to being a *little* safer and stable causes my brain to resurface ALOT of memories.
A lot of them were various forms of abuse I suffered when I was kid. From around ages 3-12. 
It’s been hard to over go and getting flashbacks to those moments, hell I just realized I have touch triggers (good to know for sure at least).
I have also made mistakes, I was a real toxic person to one of my exes. We were online dating and I believe we brought out the worst in each other (both of us were 17-18 ) I still regret the things I said whether I had intention or not, experiencing grief or not, or any other explanation. I’m glad we aren’t together for the sake of us both.
However, I bring these up cause I wanted to ask;  Does anyone else find it difficult to know these things that happened to you in your childhood weren’t your fault, but when you think of every mistake and wrong doing you’ve ever done, it feels like you don’t deserve good?
I think I’m trying really hard to change and be better. To not allow my past to influence my decisions or my triggers to take ahold of my kid. But I feel like I deserve to suffer for hurting people intentionally or not. Especially people I loved and cared about who aren’t in my life any longer.
I guess I just wanted some insight to this as a person who struggles a lot with mental health. Sometimes I wonder if I’m lying to myself and that inside  I’m actually a monster who wants to hurt people and do evil and destroy others, despite the fact I just want to love and give.

"TW: sexual harassment
——

srry this is probably gonna be pretty lengthy, bear with me.


so for context, i've been dealing with a regular at my job who's been harassing me. he's since been banned from the store, but before he was he would come in and literally just look for me and then make sexual comments.

the first couple of times he came in, he was only there briefly? he commented on my body, how we were married and gonna have kids, and has asked me a few times what time i get off of work? he also said he was heartbroken bc i have an ""old man"" and that he'd never wash his hand again after we shook hands. i told my manager, he tells the guy off, and the guy leaves.

this is where i start to think i Might've either been really traumatized or gotten ptsd?? 

so he came back into the store after maybe a week of me not seeing him and it's Bad. it's a lot, so a brief list would probably be easier to read.

• he says he hasn't seen me in a while
• he also says he's been thinking about me all the time
• he only came in that day to see me (which makes me think he's literally looking for me whenever he goes in)
• he says that he likes me a lot and that he wants me
• gives me a weird bracelet with hair on it (he's bald. ive had someone say it could be pubic and i Hope it's not)
• we shake hands (i only shook his hand bc i was thinking like. ""okay just do this and he'll leave you alone) and he doesn't let my hand go, like he's trying to hold my hand
• proceeds to force me to make eye contact with him so he can tell me just how much he likes me
• offered me food? which isn't awful but considering what he's done, it made me nervous.

so he leaves and comes back later that night, LOOKS FOR ME, and when he finds me he basically says the same thing. NOW though, he's saying that he knows i like him too (i don't), and basically just keeps reiterating that he likes me. he then proceeds to hug me (i didn't hug him back or anything, i just leaned away) and says i liked the hug (i really didn't).

he was banned after i told one of my coworkers about that, so i should be fine now? but i have NOT been able to stop thinking about what's happened. in the span of one day, i've woken up from multiple nightmares related to this. i'll get flashbacks to when he forced me to look at him and i just get so fucking anxious bc all i see are his freaky eyes, and it's just. almost every waking thought i have is related to this. i'm so scared that he'll come into the store even after being banned and i get tense whenever i see someone that even remotely looks like him, because it just reminds me of everything.

so, tl;dr— i was being severely harassed at work and now i think (emphasis on think) i might have ptsd. help?"	scareologys	post	19.504440435077907	female	White	0.9980247020721436	na	na	na	6	ptsd	no prediction.

"I waitressed in highschool and had similar experiences. Mostly commenting to let you know you're not alone.

Trauma accumulates. When I waitressed I was 15-17. A guy in his 30s gave me a huge tip and asked for my number. I didn't know what to do so I gave it to him and he actually would text me. Thank god my phone broke. But I remember I was shaking after that and I lost my appetite. That was one of many experiences. Another guy in his 20s cornered me and wouldn't take no for an answer. There were many old men who were inappropriate with me. Who would ask for hugs. I once apologized for not having enough change in quarters and having to give more smaller coins and an older man literally said to me, a high schooler, that if I went out back with him we could make it all better. There was a delivery guy probably in his 40s who had a daughter two years younger then me (and three other kids) who had a super inappropriate conversation with me asking what the longest I ever kissed someone was (I hadn't had my first kiss yet) and then asked me out.  Unfortunately, there's more than just this and I only worked there for two years and a summer. 

But after every time I would be so shaken. So I understand what you're feeling. I also would have a fawn response and kind of go along with what they want to try to not upset them. It's really hard to fight that response. 

After I graduated highschool I fawned my way into my first relationship (a guy just said I was his girlfriend) and then he would force things and it was horrible. I finally got the courage to get out of it. I'm 29 now and have been in therapy and am working really hard to try to understand my responses. Why I would just go along with things I didn't want and why I can be so afraid to stick up for myself. And why certain things like street harassment and even just being asked out can send me into such fight/flight/ or fawn responses. 

I'd encourage you to do the same! I'm finally getting to a point where I can forgive myself for fawning, or freezing. And I'm finally starting to feel angry at the people who were so inappropriate to me during such a formative time in my life. It's hard work, and it's so so hard to start. 

I'm sorry your workplace feels unsafe now. I'm sorry you're dealing with a person like that. And I hope you find the help you need <3 sending love and healing for you"	scareologys	reply	na	na	na	0.9980247020721436	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"Not diagnosing in anyway, but read this (it's a lot): Also, seek therapy (not said in a snarky way at all, as I am currently in therapy for PTSD from SA trauma when I was a child and the abuse that was in my family).  

&#x200B;

Full copyrighted criteria are available from the American Psychiatric Association (2). All of the criteria are required for the diagnosis of PTSD. The following text summarizes the diagnostic criteria:
  

  
Criterion A (1 required): The person was exposed to: death, threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or actual or threatened sexual violence, in the following way(s):
  

  
Direct exposure
  
Witnessing the trauma
  
Learning that the trauma happened to a close relative or close friend
  
Indirect exposure to aversive details of the trauma, usually in the course of professional duties (e.g., first responders, medics)
  
Criterion B (1 required): The traumatic event is persistently re-experienced, in the following way(s):
  

  
Unwanted upsetting memories
  
Nightmares
  
Flashbacks
  
Emotional distress after exposure to traumatic reminders
  
Physical reactivity after exposure to traumatic reminders
  
Criterion C (1 required): Avoidance of trauma-related stimuli after the trauma, in the following way(s):
  

  
Trauma-related thoughts or feelings
  
Trauma-related reminders
  
Criterion D (2 required): Negative thoughts or feelings that began or worsened after the trauma, in the following way(s):
  

  
Inability to recall key features of the trauma
  
Overly negative thoughts and assumptions about oneself or the world
  
Exaggerated blame of self or others for causing the trauma
  
Negative affect
  
Decreased interest in activities
  
Feeling isolated
  
Difficulty experiencing positive affect
  
Criterion E (2 required): Trauma-related arousal and reactivity that began or worsened after the trauma, in the following way(s):
  

  
Irritability or aggression
  
Risky or destructive behavior
  
Hypervigilance
  
Heightened startle reaction
  
Difficulty concentrating
  
Difficulty sleeping
  
Criterion F (required): Symptoms last for more than 1 month.
  

  
Criterion G (required): Symptoms create distress or functional impairment (e.g., social, occupational).
  

  
Criterion H (required): Symptoms are not due to medication, substance use or other illness.
  

  
Two specifications:
  

  
Dissociative Specification. In addition to meeting criteria for diagnosis, an individual experiences high levels of either of the following in reaction to trauma-related stimuli:
  
Depersonalization. Experience of being an outside observer of or detached from oneself (e.g., feeling as if ""this is not happening to me"" or one were in a dream).
  
Derealization. Experience of unreality, distance, or distortion (e.g., ""things are not real"").
  
Delayed Specification. Full diagnostic criteria are not met until at least 6 months after the trauma(s), although onset of symptoms may occur immediately.
  
Note: DSM-5 introduced a preschool subtype of PTSD for children ages six years and younger.
  

  
Back to Top
  

  
How Do the DSM-5 PTSD Symptoms Compare to DSM-IV Symptoms?
  
Overall, the symptoms of PTSD are generally comparable between DSM-5 and DSM-IV. With no changes to the diagnostic criteria in DSM-5-TR, the comparison below remains unchanged. A few key alterations include:
  

  
The revision of Criterion A1 in DSM-5 narrowed qualifying traumatic events such that the unexpected death of family or a close friend due to natural causes is no longer included.
  
Criterion A2, requiring that the response to a traumatic event involved intense fear, hopelessness, or horror, was removed from DSM-5. Research suggests that Criterion A2 did not improve diagnostic accuracy (2).
  
The avoidance and numbing cluster (Criterion C) in DSM-IV was separated into 2 criteria in DSM-5: Criterion C (avoidance) and Criterion D (negative alterations in cognitions and mood). This results in a requirement that a PTSD diagnosis includes at least one avoidance symptom.
  
Three new symptoms were added:
  
Criterion D (Negative thoughts or feelings that began or worsened after the trauma): Overly negative thoughts and assumptions about oneself or the world; and, negative affect
  
Criterion E (Trauma-related arousal and reactivity that began or worsened after the trauma): Reckless or destructive behavior"	scareologys	reply	na	na	na	0.9980247020721436	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

If you're not already on medication I might give that a try. It would help regulate you and show your partner that you're trying your best to get in control of what you're experiencing.

Missed a government job deadline. i wrote my answers fine (600 words) but as i was trying to read their questions and long silly answer choices my mind became foggy and when i went to next page it showed i wasnt signed in so i spent time trying to sign in. So i had to fill out my answers again, so hard to read all the text in their silly multiple choice answers. By the time i finished it was 12:00 and the Submit button was gone. I feel like a failure i feel frozen. I am frozen. Its beyond my control. I miss my old brain. I miss the old me. Thankfully there are other jobs, but this job isnt available again until 2025. and the pay wouldve been good and i wouldve felt somewhat safe working for the government. i know in my heart i wasnt meant to miss this opportunity.

"My boyfriend had a friend visiting for the weekend. He had to go to work yesterday, and while he was gone, his friend kept making comments about my nice boobs and nipples, and if I was his girlfriend, he wouldn’t have turned me down for sex like my boyfriend did when I crawled into bed naked with my boyfriend. 
I felt very uncomfortable and went into my bedroom to put a bra on ( I was wearing my pajama shorts and tank top) and said I was going to take a nap. He came into my bedroom and crawled into bed with me and started to grab my boobs and crotch and tried kissing my neck. I told him to stop and he wouldn’t. Luckily my boyfriends brother and nephew came over and saw what was happening. I would have been raped if they didn’t come over. They went home and dropped off the 4 wheeler and his brother came back to pick me up and get the guy out of my house. 
I keep getting messages from this guy threatening to tell my boyfriend that it was all me and that I send pics and texts to other men. The other men are friends of mine and there has never been any inappropriate pictures or messages, and my friends can confirm this. 
I haven’t had a chance to talk to my boyfriend about this yet since he’s at work again today. He kept the guy at his apartment and his ex friend left today. 
I was raped by my ex fiancé and abused in every way you could imagine. I was just starting to heal from that trauma from over 4 years ago. I feel so dirty and gross and I’m scared. I keep making sure my doors are locked. I’m having a breakdown and I don’t know what to do. 
A few friends that I told about this and my boyfriends brother have been checking on me today and are making sure I am safe. I just needed to vent and see if anyone knows what I can do to calm myself down.  I’m completely shaking even though I have taken 2 Ativan already.

Thank you for your kind words.  I’m going to block that guy after I show my boyfriend the messages. I am safe and have friends checking on me.

"I have PTSD, and some months ago, I suffered an illness called Guillain Barre. I was almost completely paralyzed for a month, and I am now slowly recovering. Now I can walk slowly.   
 I just need the freedom to feel sad and scared, but I can't do that. I am currently living with my family, and they are very supportive, I don't have to worry about money, for which I am grateful. But when it comes to emotional support, it is exhausting to have to be in a good mood all the time. They don't  tolerate negative emotions, not to mention crying. I can't express my sadness and fear. They tell me, it can be worse, I can walk, I will recover, I  should be grateful. And yeah, I am, I am happy to be alive, and in a good mood most of times. This illness gave me a new understanding of how precious life is. But I need compassion, I need the freedom to be sad, and someone to allow me to just be sad and grieve what I am going through.

"That is really tough and you are strong for having to deal with this. Not only are you physically recovering from an illness…you are also going through the emotional recovery, and you feel like you don’t have the freedom or space to do that.

I’m just a stranger on the internet but I want you to know that it IS ok to grieve and feel sad. Humans aren’t robot. It’s possible that your family isn’t comfortable around strong negative emotions which is why they seem so unsupportive in that regard. That’s not an excuse but just a reason to think about, to maybe give them some benefit of the doubt. You said they are supportive otherwise so it doesn’t seem like they are malicious about it.

It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders and you are pushing forward despite these challenges which is commendable. 

This might seem like a silly idea but maybe when you have private time (e.g. in your room) you could dedicate a portion of that time to “feeling sad” and literally crying. Sometimes just the act of crying can bring relief to the pent up sadness we feel inside.

And if you ever want to chat, feel free to hit me up. I’m not a therapist or a doctor but I know what it’s like to get tired of “being on” as I call it, struggling with PTSD and all the things that come with it. 
And may I just say I hate that expression “it can always be worse?”  My thoughts of compassion for it is it’s as socially acceptable and expected as strangers asking *at me* the name, age and breed of my dog, but that saying in particular… it’s so invalidating. Things *could be worse* this is true I guess, but you still have to get through what’s going on.

"So I have have ptsd, I been going to therapy for a few months now and it has helped a lot. I think its also important to note that im approaching the one year mark  from my kidnapping and the lost of my mother. Im in a safe place right now but im really stuggling to get any sleep. it not like im getting flash backs or getting panic attacks I just can't seem to sleep. my therapist suggested sleeping meds but I feel like they don't help. When I take them I sleep but I wake up even more tied then when I stay up and only slept  for 2-3 hours so I want to try other methods that isn't meds. anyone got any tips or suggestion on how they get to sleep when they get restless. any shows to watch, music? YouTube channels  just overall  things that you use to be able to get some rest. I will try anything to get some  sleep. any thing is appreciated. 

ps I normally watch tv (futurama)  n if that doesn't work I just turn stuff off and I would stay still till I fell asleep. I normally don't struggle this hard to go to sleep and the few weeks  I did struggle I would just stay up until my body gave out, and I can't do that it sucks to much I can't get anything done if I do that."

"Well first I'd recommend the singer Banshee (dark electronic variety), pretty much all her music is about standing against her abusers, especially sexual abusers. 

I'd also recommend some songs by Poppy (metal/alt rock), specifically ""Never Find My Place,"" ""As Strange As It Seems,"" ""Her,"" ""Bloodmoney"" (religion warning for that one, I can elaborate), ""Pocket,"" and ""So Mean."" All of those tie back to past abuse she faced, from speculation, and are about being controlled and/or abused in general. 

Melanie Martinez' recent album (alt pop) has a few gems here too. ""Evil"" is about an egotistical abuser calling their victim the bad guy, and ""Nymphology"" is basically telling someone who controlled and judged you to fuck off. ""Powder"" is about losing faith in someone who's a drug addict cus they won't accept your help.

"I am so sorry you are struggling with this.  Have you been talking to a therapist or pastor?  If not, having that third party unbiased source help us work through this mess called life can often do wonders.

As for PTSD, I get you.  After three combat tours as a helicopter pilot I certainly could make the claim to fame in the PTSD world.  However, I don't.  I have been asked how, after experiencing the things I have I do not have PTSD.  The answer is actually very simple and two fold.

1.  First, I try to remember the lives of my friends that did not come home and the lives they would have wanted to live.  Then, I try to live a life that honors their memory.
2. Second, and most importantly.  Jesus Christ.  Now, I am NOT talking religion.  Rather, I am talking relationship.  A very real realationship with a very real and living God.  Through that realationship with Christ I not only have a hope for the future that all this crap this world throws at us will be set to rights, but there is a purpose for enduring this mess to begin with!  That purpose:  showing the same love, grace, and mercy to others that He first showed us.

Well, one final thing I might suggest is go get the book The Love Dare.  It is probably at any libarary for free or you can get it from a book store.   But I HIGHLY recommend it even when things are going well in a marriage, but especially if things are rough.

Realistically I know not everyone is going to be a monster towards me, but I'm told I need to work on trusting and feeling safe around my therapist for therapy to work. He dropped me because we weren't getting anywhere even though I've been trying my best to get over my paranoia and all his trust building exercises and stuff weren't getting anywhere and I was too dissociated and hypervigilant and distrustful. I know I have to want to trust but I don't even know how to want that. I *want to* want to trust, but this experience is already making me feel reserved towards that too. I can say 'not everyone is secretly a violent, abusive, monster that wants to hurt me' and I can acknowledge other people say it's irrational, but I feel like I'm vindicated every other week and reminded again and again and again why I'm right, and it's hard not to see these people that want to tear down my walls as complicit and I just really have no idea what to do and I feel hopeless. I never feel safe, nothing soothes me, I can't stand being around other people because of how viscerally they terrify me. I desperately need care because I can't work thanks to this and everywhere I go I get told I'm too difficult a patient and get cut loose.

"I have no idea why because the incident that I went through had nothing to do with violence. It was very much verbal abuse. But you see I was watching Evil Dead Rise yesterday. There are a few times in the movie where a characters getting attacked and then the other characters take really long to respond and help the other person. I was so angry when this happened. I felt like I was going to die.

No one defended me when it happened. My abuser and I were outside with 30 other people and no one said anything. My best friend is right next to me standing right next to me and she didn’t say anything. She made me go to that alone. I’m not blaming her because it happened years ago and she was scared too but sometimes I just wonder maybe if she said something that day, maybe things would’ve been different. Maybe I wouldn’t spend years of my life trying not to kill myself. Even though it’s never entirely gone away. My suicidal thoughts."

I don't normally have nightmares, but this past week I've had two of being on the run from my dad. He was abusive to me as a teenager. I left the house at 16. I reconnected with him when I was 22. We don't talk much, I text him here and there but we don't have much of a relationship. I'm also quitting smoking weed so I know that might have something to do with it (sober dreams?). It just sucks having dreams like that.

"The “C” stands for “complex.” C-PTSD is used to describe PTSD brought on by prolonged trauma (childhood abuse, abusive relationships, etc.) and has additional defining traits in addition to the ones associated with PTSD that are associated with both the stage of development that the trauma took place, which is why it’s commonly associated with childhood abuse. The distinction is important when it comes to addressing the symptoms.

PTSD itself can be brought on by a single traumatic incident. Those who experience PTSD from a single event typical lack the behavioral characteristics that make C-PTSD “complex”.

So it definitely makes a difference in terms in how patients are diagnosed and treated."	Opening_Oil3044	reply	na	na	na	0.9950845837593079	no	no	no	na	ptsd	failed
"Yes, they're actually pretty different. Keep in mind that psychology is a combination of science and the human experience... these are just the best labels we've found to describe these issues. 

As another commenter said, they both have different causes (one single traumatic event, vs. prolonged trauma) and different presentations.

C-PTSD is a very important addition to the DSM, because it legitimizes things like childhood abuse, which may not have been one identifiable traumatic event, but still had a significant impact."	Opening_Oil3044	reply	na	na	na	0.9950845837593079	no	no	no	na	ptsd	failed

Yeah. From my understanding ptsd and cptsd tend to be different in how deeply rooted your symptoms are. With cptsd they tend to be rooted into the personality especially because cptsd usually starts young and therapy for cptsd is usually life long or several years and focuses intensely on getting those deep rooted belief systems into order and in my experience you often slowly come out of years of therapy a completely different person. I remember one day I can’t really pinpoint but I remember one day in therapy I kind of just ended the EMDR sesh and felt light and airy and the world was a little brighter. That goes on for years and it really is a work of art. Ptsd however is a little looser in my opinion. Someone may go into it with a strong belief system but an accident or an event shakes that belief around to where you’re not sure if you can believe it anymore and therapy helps you recognize the proper way of thinking	Opening_Oil3044	reply	na	na	na	0.9950845837593079	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
"C-PTSD is more ‘complex’. There is a lot of ‘smaller’ traumas that build up and morph into C-PTSD. More common when the trauma is long term, like an abusive childhood, or an abusive relationship. 

PTSD is usually caused by one event. Like an SA, witnessing a death, or being in a dangerous situation. It could also be caused by listening to peoples traumas for years on end (common if you work in the medical field, mental health, or first responders)"	Opening_Oil3044	reply	na	na	na	0.9950845837593079	no	no	no	na	ptsd	failed

"I was raped last year and developed ptsd from that and my main struggle has been my anxiety, depression, insomnia and nightmares. I have been getting better after a lot of therapy and medication but yesterday I was driving my car on holiday with my friends and got in to a car crash on a thin country road on the bend. Thankfully the worst injuries are whiplash, concussion and bruises. We were extremely lucky as the other car caused me to spin out and the back wheels of the car were right on the edge of a river which i wouldn’t have survived with a jammed door and being knocked out for a few seconds. 

Im now worried that i will experience similar symptoms of nightmares (which i have had a few of already since i’ve only been getting an hour or so sleep at a time which tend to have nightmares that wake me up about the crash) and i just can’t go through that again, I barely survived the last year with my mental health. With the car crash as well I cant afford a new one and i shared it with my dad. He has assured me he’s not worried about the money and is just glad i’m okay but it’s another reason i’m under stress. Just about to start a new job but my ptsd and mental health stopped me from working last year up until now and i just can’t afford to do that again.

I just need advice on how to deal with the potential for my ptsd to develop with this and any advice on how to cope with the nightmares that are inevitable.

Really sorry to hear what you've been through. There's a bunch of studies linking Tetris to improved outcomes post trauma. Something about the puzzles helps your brain process things. It reduces the odds of developing PTSD after a traumatic event. Not sure if there's numbers on its effects on people who already have PTSD, but I'd give that a shot and see if it helps.

"I’m sorry you’re having to deal with all of this. I also deal with complex trauma so I’ll speak about my experience in hopes that it can help you.

The most basic and accessible way to deal with symptoms of PTSD is DISTRACTION. Okay so, I’m triggered. My brain has perceived some stimulus to be dangerous and the alarm is sounded and instincts take over and I want to fight or fly. What my brain needs in this moment are pleasant sensations to basically bring it out of survival mode and bring my frontal lobe back on line. A picture of a beloved family member. A dog or cat to pet. A nice smelling lotion or perfume. A hug from spouse. A rock from an enjoyable hiking trip. A piece of chocolate. Anything that can stimulate your senses to tell your brain “everything is okay, enjoy this smell/taste/sight”. Over time, it gets easier to notice when a trigger is about to happen or is happening and what can be done to hijack that false alarm so those unpleasant extreme emotions and symptoms don’t take root and ruin life. It takes time and there’s always something to learn! I also utilize a crisis hotline when I need help getting out of a post trauma line of thinking/feeling.

About the nightmares. Look up bilateral stimulation; practices online or tracks on Spotify. They are known to create a sense of ease and help with sleep.

"Firstly, I’m so sorry this happened to you. It’s a lot to process, having two huge traumatic events happen to you back to back. 

I want to share something with you. I had an very similar thing happen to me and maybe I can help with some advice. I’m a survivor of domestic violence, I was diagnosed with CPTSD I’m 2017 and have spent years trying to recover while still being stalked and harassed by my ex. That alone has been a very difficult thing to deal with but I have managed to get by until now. Last year I was in a really bad car accident, just like you. I was VERY lucky to survive, but came out of it with a mild brain injury (concussion) as well. 

What is most important for you to do right now is to deal with the after effects of your concussion. I’m not sure what the circumstances of your accident were or where in the world you’re located but if it is an option I would highly advise that you talk to a lawyer. Don’t make any assumptions about wether or not that’s the right thing to do in your case, just find a good personal injury attorney and meet with them. In my case it was the smartest decision I have ever made,  it has allowed me to take time to heal without having to worry about working. Hopefully this can be an option for you as well.

Even if that’s not an option for you, try to prioritize healing from your brain injury first. See professionals who specialize in concussions if you can.People tend to downplay mild brain injuries (concussions) But the truth is that they can have pretty devastating long term effects. Mine has affected my vision, my PTSD, made it difficult to walk a straight line and caused me incessant headaches. But I’m slowly getting better with the proper care. 

Your concussion alone could cause an uptick in your PTSD symptoms, so don’t be hard on yourself for feeling the way you do. One thing that really helps me is to look at my struggles less as “mental health” and more as “brain health” , I apply this to my PTSD as well. The brain has an amazing ability to recover from both injury and trauma , research neuroplasticity. Your PTSD symptoms can absolutely lessen with time and the proper care. 

My PTSD got worse right after the accident . Ive had reoccurring nightmares and flashbacks. I have developed a few new symptoms of PTSD that I didn’t really struggle with before. I am juggling that with the many doctors appointments and daily responsibilities I have as a single mom, some days I feel really overwhelmed like you do, you just have to extend yourself a little grace. Be patient with yourself, things get bad and then get better and then sometimes they go back to being bad again and etc. just because you feel these symptoms so so strongly right now doesn’t mean they won’t lessen over time. Be kind to yourself, your dad is right, the value of a car is nothing when weighed against the value of a life. You are worthy of self love, take care of yourself, we have experienced a lot but I believe that we are still here for a reason. 

I don’t want you to think I’m invalidating the severity of what you are feeling right now, you have every right to feel the way you do. I just know what has worked so far for me, every single day is indeed a struggle but I’m getting through it and I know that it is possible for you as well 💕"	awayingsthrows	reply	na	na	na	0.9813417196273804	strong	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"First of all I want to say thank you, it has genuinely helped to hear that. I’m in England so with free healthcare i don’t have to worry about medical bills etc and can get checked up by a GP.

I didn’t realise concussions could cause an uptick in PTSD symptoms so I will try keep that in mind and try not to be too hard on myself with it.

Im living with my parents up until I move in to my new place in a month who are aware of everything and have been a great support system for me. I guess one of the main things i’m feeling right now is guilt for wrecking the car and hurting my friends.

"I cut contact with my sisters, brothers, mom.  Several months ago, my younger sister somehow got my phone number.  

I answered and she was talking really loud, “It’s me, your sister.  I said hi, then I panicked, hung up and immediately called and changed my number. 

She used to be such a sweet and kind person. She found our stepmom with a gunshot wound to her head. That was when she was 6.  

She went from one abusive relationship to another as an adult. Turned to drugs and alcohol. I’m not judging that. I understand that her pain was too much. She was also a chronic pain sufferer. 

Our worst fears came true about 4 days ago. We were notified that she passed away from an overdose. 

I have so much guilt. That last phone call. Her voice, knowing I will never hear her or see her again. 

This is my second sister that I’ve lost. 

I regret not being there for my sisters.  We come from a very dysfunctional and abusive background. I just couldn’t keep trying to help her and have it blow up in my face."	Flat_Reason8356	post	31.44776883214643	male	White	0.9973502159118652	na	na	na	2	ptsd	no prediction.

"I have been thinking a lot about this lately. Why is my life like this and how I was before the trauma? Why am I behind people who used to be dumb compared to me? Why am I always in traumatizing situations ?

Before: great student. Got myself in one of the top schools in the country by my own merit. Never had a bad grade.
After :  My grades were worse than the dumbest kid in class. Had to do a gre in my country in the end because I couldn’t even finish high school.

I spent years dissociating and my life wasn’t going anywhere. After 7 years I was able to talk about the trauma and stoped dissociating.

Afterwards I had the strong desire to leave and build a life somewhere else specially away from the triggering environment of my own home. I wannted to start fresh moved to another country everything went wrong met a man who I thought Would be my savior and now I  find myself one decade behind.

How much did trauma change my life? Where would I have been if I didn’t have ptsd ?

I would have gone to college. Since I was a good student it wouldn’t be hard for me to get in. I wouldn’t have depression. I wouldn’t have had the huge urge to fly and move someplace else . I wouldn’t have the urge to have a savior and co dependent behavior . I would not have married without a degree and got pregnant.

I have been reading and thinking about this and this is the conclusion:

There is something about what I’m gonna call a spiral of traumas. Why after trauma I only put myself and was exposed to more and more trauma ? Why did my life become a succession of tragedies ? This is the conclusion I came up with:

 My judgement became cloudy after trauma and my self esteem low. I lost focus and cognitive capacity and my mentality stayed at the age of the traumatic event. I  became vulnerable and my life became a spiral of traumas. When I analyze the story of my life I see that every other traumatic situation I was in  and all the bad decisions I made in my adult life  were made based on my trauma."

Nothing happens by mistake and everything has a reason.

They are good, but you are better. It's called experience. All jobs want experience, right? I'd say sign up to Indeed and look for Crisis Counselor jobs. Apply and take the training.

"I re-joined the dating app where I got in touch with my attacker! He’s there! It’s him, even the same profile picture! I want to scream. I reported him to the app after we met. The man sexually assaulted me and without my consent, pushed me down and choked me! He could have killed me! What’s worst is he never apologised and when I saw him by chance in person three days after, he wanted nothing to do with me. As if I was the burden.

He’s on the dating app and worst, he still lives near me. 😱 It’s re-triggered me from months of good progress of not being afraid of walking around my own neighbourhood.

"earlier this year, i attempted suicide. some context, i had also been slightly struggling with self harm for about 2 months before, and this all followed an increase in Zoloft which my family and i believe to have been the cause of all these thoughts (i was not depressed before starting Zoloft, it was just for anxiety, which it helped with, but we have stopped it since the attempt). this i feel is also important because it all feels like not at all a thing that really happened because i was really not in my typical mindset at all. i had a bad experience with staff at the mental hospital after this yelling and swearing at me for needing to take naps in the day, which also has kind of caused its own ptsd-ish symptoms but not as much as the attempt in general. since the SH left scars on my arms and legs i cant really go a day without thinking about that, and its not very extreme symptoms just a bit of anxiety about it but sometimes ill just kind of go into a spiral of thinking about it and feeling shameful about it. i tried to not  think or talk about the attempt as much as possible for myself because i didnt feel comfortable thinking about it, but obviously i would still and id just think about everything leading up to it and have kind of memories of moments in the hospital and again feeling shameful about it. recently i have had to think about it a lot more because my parents and i have been collecting information from the charts about things my psychiatrist did so that we can switch to a new one (thats a whole other thing in itself and they are thinking about a lawsuit). she didnt really take suicidal thoughts seriously, or the attempt/SH after the fact, and her notes show this. my parents havent been forcing me to think or talk about anything but just thinking about all that again makes that worse and im wondering if these are mild ptsd symptoms or something else. 

also i have a great therapist and should have a new psychiatrist soon- but i havent really talked with my therapist much about either of these things that happened and any time shes started to bring up self harm ive completely shut down and started crying and couldnt function for the rest of the meeting."	leebeep2	post	20.20281077301785	female	White	0.9951099753379822	na	na	na	3	ptsd	failed

"hi -- so i can only speak from my personal experience as well, but zoloft made me severely depressed and literally like... innately suicidal. its like i felt it in my bones and i have a long history of mental illness + trying medication, so i know depression. however, zoloft took me to a low that was terrifying.

 i hope this doesn't get flagged because i feel like this is important but it is important as hell that you remember everything you felt and assess how you felt coming off of it (the weeks after), how long you were on it, when you started feeling that way / at what dose, etc. like every little thing. it's important also because it's normally the rule of thumb that psychiatrists will try to put you on two SSRIs before they try you on anything else. zoloft is an SSRI and it may just be zoloft, but it may also be all SSRIs. 

in terms of the PTSD - it could be. what you went through was traumatic. it could be acute (the symptoms last less than 6mo) or chronic (more than 6mo) but it's nothing to be ashamed of. we are nothing without our mental health and it is just as important as our physical health. 

having a therapist who you're compatible with and a psychiatrist who genuinely has your best interest is the first step. what has helped me in trauma is the general acceptance of what it is. it sounds stupidly simple but kind of seeing it for what it is plainly and clicking it into my brain that sucks and it sucks to talk about helps because eventually it sucks less, or at least im able to regulate it a bit better. and eventually it'll come and go and you'll have coping skills to get through the hardest parts of it. 

the last thing you said - you have your own autonomy. if you're not ready to talk about certain things, you don't have to. you're allowed boundaries and letting a doctor or therapist know that is a good thing to do."	leebeep2	reply	na	na	na	0.9951099753379822	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

My fiancé is very supportive, but if we get into a fight I spiral - I scream, I throw things, I hit things, tell him to leave, tell him I cant be with him, etc. We've gotten into physical fights twice only but its as if I cant control my hands. I literally go at him swinging and pushing him and he just pushes back. I've been able to channel that into slamming a water bottle on the table to hitting a table instead of going after him (not much better but it's a work in progress). I've been in therapy for 4 years now but I still feel like I have such a hard time controlling the rage when it comes. its like 0-100 instead of feeling it coming on and being able to manage that. Does anyone have any advice on how they have been able to manage the rage? I leave the episode just feeling ashamed and disgusted with my lack of control and don't want to do this to my fiancé anymore, he doesn't deserve it	FriendshipHairy3203	post	25.543731245409308	female	White	0.9948793649673462	na	na	na	4	ptsd	failed

"I also struggled with rage. My sense is that that rage is basically already there and waiting for an outlet. To some extent you might need to purge that emotion. we can be very angry about the things that happened to us. Releasing the charge by allowing yourself to feel anger towards or about your trauma can help.  But it needs to be done in a way that releases the emotion instead of just creating more of it. So it’s kind of feeling and accepting but also letting go. 

The rage comes from the pain which is the next layer down sort of. The rage both covers it up and is caused by it. So letting yourself feel into the pain but then again as before letting it go. 

This is a process that takes a lot of iterations."	FriendshipHairy3203	reply	na	na	na	0.9948793649673462	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
You are so right and I think realistically, deep down I do know that but in the moment it’s so hard it feels like I have zero control in acting it out but I need to process it. I think I’m noticing that in my times of rage when I’m just acting on it instead of just processing it I’m making it worse for myself in the long run	FriendshipHairy3203	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9948793649673462	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
I like to think of it like a battery that has a charge. If I’m carrying around “100,000 volts” of rage then it’s going up inevitably arc and shock someone. Or I’ll do something destructive that hurts me. So while managing the rage in the moment is important, I think it’s actually more important to “reduce the charge of the battery” by processing the rage itself.

"Now I’ve been let go from work I only have one more thing left to lose from the fallout of my assault… my relationship. 
And I honestly don’t know where I’d be if it wasn’t for her or what I’d do without her. Well I do, but I can’t tell her that, because it feels manipulative. It must be a lot of pressure being the only person who truly knows/understands me. I don’t want her to feel anymore responsible for my well-being than she already does, or feel unable to do what she may need to do if it gets any worse. 

My employers were so considerate, tried everything they could and gave me 2 years to try to prove myself, but my life never stopped being a shit show long enough for me to be able to. Despite many accommodations from them. 
I feel like I can’t talk to anyone know how much I’m struggling; I hate the way that they look at me when they ask about work. Or tell me how lucky I am that an employer has put up with me for this long. Whoever hired me must be getting bollocked. I feel so incredibly lonely around my everyone other than my partner. I feel like there’s no escape. I feel like there is an elephant on my chest that’s reached a critical mass and is stopping me from breathing. I feel like I’m made of useless batteries that are dead beyond revival. Diesel in a petrol tank.
There’s nothing left in me to give and yet that’s what I’m expected to do, because I’m the oldest girl daughter in the ethnic household. 
My hands shake too much to journal. I oscillate between not being able to cry, and not being able to stop. 

 I’m made of grit, blood, sweat, tears, and the “weed” that freezes my insides. Even such that I mistook it for warmth, the way it made my problems seem farther away from me. But when the emotions flood back I am so overcome with grief and despair that it feels like it’s physically weighing me down. 
I keep realising that it may not get better and I have to be prepared for that eventuality. I usually have a flippant quips in response to the voices in my head that tell me that. That things won’t or may not get better. It doesn’t normally become as all consuming and paralysing for this long. But these days, I’m less witty, and these times it does. It is. It’s all the brain fog. I haven’t moved for days. 
It is all consuming because what then? What fucking then? If I accept things may actually be like this for the foreseeable, that I’ll keep having to dust myself off and be as ‘resilient’ as they tell me I am, I also have to be honest with myself about whether I’m cut out for that. And even if I am, I don’t want to be. I shouldn’t have to be because the worst part is I’m always cleaning up messes I didn’t make, and being given notes on how to do that by those that did. Those who refuse to take responsibility. 
I’m so tired of character building and all the new ways I can learn that life isn’t fair. I feel like I’m much too young to be in the situation I’m in; I feel so out of my depth and want to fetch an adult to ask but then I remember that’s meant to be me."	toximus-prime99	post	27.171709801030236	male	White	0.2704063057899475	na	na	na	3	ptsd	failed
"You have taken the words right out of my heart. And in an exceptionally eloquent way, which is realize is irrelevant but I felt needed to be pointed out. 
I couldn’t function. I turned to substances to get through the days. And then I couldn’t function for other reasons. I’m sober now and I thought it would get easier but it hasn’t. And frankly every time someone calls me ‘resilient’ it makes me want to curl up in a ball and fade away. 
You have so much responsibility resting on your shoulders. You shouldn’t have to bear it and it’s not fair but there has to be a moment when you start placing your needs first. Otherwise the pain and the despair become cyclical. Never ending. 
I know it’s of little solace but there’s a quote that I often turn to when life becomes unbearable. It doesn’t stop the pain but it allows me to squint my eyes enough to be able to see through to the other side. 

“Oh but that’s the irony. Broken people are not fragile.”
Clinton Sammy jr.

Please don’t forget that though you may feel fragile and overwhelmed and encumbered by dread, you are so much more.

"It's feels like ""you're fucked if you do and you're fucked if you don't"". 

I was pissed for years at the fact that I have to clean up the mess my mother and stepdad made inside of me. And it's an endless cleaning job. 

And after 6 years and all the progress I've made- there's still so much work left... it's a life long necessity to continue working at healing and educating myself. (Plus so much therapy and support groups.)

It took a ton of people in my life to teach me that I was worth it. I am worth doing the work to clean the mess. 

Fortunately, youtube has tons of free educational content. And Amazon has unlimited options for trauma recovery books. 

After 6 years, I've come such a long way. And we can all do this together. I got sober. I cut out my mom. I quit smoking cigs. I started going to church. I focus on health practices. I let myself have hobbies. I even let myself have days where I do nothing but cry and grieve. Right now I'm working on clearing debt and adding exercise and self accountability. 

This can either be a shit show or a symphony. I chose to turn my life into a science project. A symphony. 

(P.s.- I had to spend years giving up on the whole idea of happiness before I decided I want a better life.)
Happiness is possible. 

P.s. x2- I'm recovering from child sex slavery and satanic ritual abuse...

"Thank you so much for sharing and replying. I feel a little less alone. I keep fighting myself over whether to accept that medicine comes in many forms and that I’m doing what I need to cope vs feeling like I need to quit and get sober. I don’t entirely want to stop dissociating me because I know what it’s protecting me from, and the alternative is worse. 
It took me so long to feel less broken and deficient for having to take mental health medication to function, and now I can’t function regardless. I’m damned if I do or don’t with regards to putting my needs first because constantly giving away pieces of myself is breaking me, but so is dealing with how they villainise me when I stop putting their needs above mine. 

Isolating myself is no good either, but is the best option to avoid having to either pretend that everything’s fine; or not, and darkening the room by several shades with my projections of despair. Or alternatively having to surround myself and rely on the people that keep perpetuating it all. Gotta pick my poison ☠️🤪

Hi I’m a 24 F nursing student diagnosed with c-ptsd. I am returning to my program after taking time off post failing a semester. I am starting to get emails about class information but every time I see an email regarding my nursing classes I start having anxiety attack symptoms and flashbacks. I feel really silly since it’s just an email, and logically I know it’s not an attack on me - it’s general information. However that is not helping the intense response.

My scars remind me that I did indeed survive my deepest wounds. That in itself is an accomplishment. And they bring to mind something else, too. They remind me that the damage life has inflicted on me has, in many places, left me stronger and more resilient.

"So I need to find resources or advice on communication that are targeted towards the person with ptsd (me) and not the spouse (wife). Everything I have found has been geared toward the spouse and how they can better handle the person suffering from ptsd and she has been doing that stuff for years. I have suffered with ptsd since 2013 (officially) from combat but as time goes on I'm realizing that some of the traumatic things in my childhood had already given it to me. I have gone through many different treatments in VA over the years P.E. CPT EMDR ECT(depression) both as outpatient and as inpatient residential programs. Things would get better and I'd have my monthly appointments with psychologist and psychiatrist, but I'd slowly back slide, not all the way but enough to the point it drastically affected my relationship with my wife. id stay on my meds and i guess subconsciously thought ""well you did the program and your taking your meds so youre good"". My psychology appointments turned into an hour long talk therapy session when I should have stayed in something more grounded in my trauma and not just my day to day b.s. I have put my wife through HELL too many times because of this and she has stuck with me, until now. she's been my care giver through the va since 2015 and always made sure I was taken care of and put  her life on hold to do it and i havent done nearly enough to show how much i appreciate it let alone have my actions show the immense love i have for her. I have always appreciated what she has done for me and I've tried to continue to get better but I do back slide when I'm not in structured therapy and I internalize my thoughts and speak in a tone and give looks that are condescending and are mostly when I'm angry with myself or the situation, not her. It's disgusting and wrong and not the way I want her to think I feel about her ever. We had our first kid 2 years ago and I have a lot of stress, anxiety and insecurities about having a baby  as my combat trauma involved a small boy. My wife has been nothing but an amazing mom and wife while still reassuring me at the same time i wasnt completely messing everything up with our daughter, while doing little for herself. I didn't realize the full scope of stress I put on her with her being my caregiver and her being a mother and my regressing communication. Something has to give and she needs to be healthy for herself first and so she can continue to be an amazing mom. I can figure out ways to not rely on her as a caregiver as much, I just want my wife back and for her to feel secure.  When we decided to have a child i should have told her i need to get my treatment structured and in place and that she doesnt need to be a caregiver to me to the same extent and ill figure out the best way to handle my daily stuff and needs in treatment. But since I was not in structured treatment my communication has regressed to the the point that she wants to leave.  I'm waiting to go back to the residential 6 week program now, i had wanted to go back months ago when she told me to find a new way to communicate with her, but stupidly i thought it was selfish of me to go to a 6 week resedential program 45min away and leave her with our daughter alone and didnt want her to have a reason to think even less of me. I just need some resources or advice on how to communicate even when I'm experiencing issues. I guess I'm realizing that I can't just do a structured treatment  every 2 years and then be good until I'm not good and have lost the one thing in my life that I could look at and be happy, even when I did the worst job showing it. I guess I treated ptsd like it was something that could just be checked up on but I was wrong again.

Ahh, harsh man, how's it been going with communication since she told you? I know that you said you made a list. Have you shown her or started demonstrating your willingness to change? She probably will think you won't keep the change because you've hurt her in the past, but  you need to do everything  that you can to keep improving. It's hard man I'd hope she would consider it working on things since you have a kid together.	i-fd-up	reply	na	na	na	0.992202877998352	weak	no	strong	na	ptsd	failed
Yea that's a tough situation, I would hope she is willing to consider staying if you taken responsibility for your faults in the past  and tried to fix them  even if you  backslid. You need to know what needs to be done to improve things and be proactive in taking the actions needed on your own. She is  exhausted, and if you want her to become healthy and happy and hopefully allow you to prove your commitment to change and to keeping that change for the long term. It seems we often realize the scope of our issues when we are confronted. Just try some mindfulness exercises and organize your thoughts before talking to her. You're right you need to be in continuous therapy for ptsd. Your wife shouldn't be your full time caregiver if comes at the cost of her health and your child's health.

Did you see this coming? Did she let you know she was thinking about divorce, or did she just hit you with it? I think the pressure of her having to assume all these roles has her so stressed, and any regression on your part  by not being in the treatment you need not only worsens it. I know you say you have made changes and progress in the past, but you say  you always struggle with communication. You need to make that priority number one. I don't know what this program entails, but I would make sure they know that communication is your biggest struggle. She needs to know you are capable of making lasting change and be someone she can lean on and depend on, not a liability she has to worry about in 5 years which is going to be hard, but it sounds like you love her and your daughter more than anything so use that to continue to improve yourself for your wife and daughter and yourself.	i-fd-up	reply	na	na	na	0.992202877998352	no	no	strong	na	ptsd	failed
I've been in a similar situation, I have ptsd and my wife had our first kid 4 years ago. It's been a constant  adjustment ever since for both of us and we had similar issues, my sole focus went to ensuring the baby's needs were met and not my own and not my wife's and likewise for her. it's hard for her when your used to having support and it feels like it's not there when you really need it  or your partner fell back on there progress to deal the stress in the best way they know how. She tslked about leaving me but we talked through it and realized we needed to ensure we were hsppy as well as the baby otherwise the baby's life would be worse off in 2 homes when he could be happy in 1 home . I think that having this discussion and putting a plan in place that shows what you expect of yourself going forward  and you know the consequences of failure and you both know that raising a child can be trying but if you fix your communication issues alot of that can be alleviated.	i-fd-up	reply	na	na	na	0.992202877998352	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

Man that's a cold way to find out. If she knew that you knew something was wrong and were trying to figure it out and fix things and were willing to improve yourself she could of let you know her feelings. I think most people would have the decency to let their partner know that they were ready to leave them before just absolutely gutting them. She sounds like my ex. She was a real C*nt,  She took off with my kid and has been using my issues and anything I told her in confidence to hurt me. But then again I was sick of her shit by the end  and didn't want or see a future with her, just fair custody with my kid. Good luck, and keep trying if that's what you really want.

I haven't shown her, im afraid,i love her and our family more than anything and this is best thing ive ever had but, I think she'll just throw it back in my face and ask why I didn't I do these things before now. She says she doesn't hate me and she is afraid we will be right back in this position in 5 years, and she has stayed 2 times before when things were worse. I just wish I had a chance to fight for my family. I really think it would work if I stick to my end and sell the house and be completely debt free and not put  pressure on her as a caregiver and have a fresh start. i love her too the moon and back. It's too much for her wellbeing. I wish I had gone to the program when I felt like I needed to, I didn't want her to think of me as a failure and being selfish by leaving her with our daughter for 6 weeks.  I knew something was wrong after I had spoken to her in anger. I was angry at mysel,  and she was just trying to help. We haven't had a date since my daughter was born, and I was trying to ask her what was wrong and ask her out on date, but before I could ask, she just told me it was over.

I see her, and my stomach is knots. All I want to do is tell her how much i love her  and beg for forgiveness. I know my shortcomings and failures have hurt her more than anyone. I have tried each time to improve but after time I regress, not to the same point but my communication at times is demeaning condescending and hurtful. I don't call names or swear or insult but I do talk down to her which is a disgusting way to talk to the woman who is the love of my life. I know she wants to file right away because the last 2 times she went back on it and didnt file so I understand her position I just wish I could show her my willingness and demonstrate my ability to change. I feel now I have the full plan on what I need to do improve myself and be the best husband and father. I need to be in focused therapy and talk therapy and and attend group and do whatever I can to keep her stress level down and not let my issues add to it.being a husband and father the last 2 years have been amazing and I don't want to lose the moments with my wife and daughter because of things I should of fixed.	i-fd-up	follow-up	na	na	na	0.992202877998352	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
Thank you. I have been trying to make a list of all the ways I have completely failed her and things I can do to improve immediately. I'm actually going to a mindfulness group this week and waiting to join 2 others. I have a psychology appointment later in the month. I might go to our local vet center as well. The list is basically all the things I failed at and the way I can do something to improve it in the short term and over the long term. I've been the worst partner throughout our marriage. I've done so many vile and hurtful things that I'm disgusted. I have always tried to do better, but communication is where I have backslid the most. It is a terrible trait that I picked up as a kid, I guess. That's not an excuse, but it's a fault I must overcome overcome. I love her more than anything. And sometimes I feel like I wasnt playing with a full deck with treatment and thought I was doing the right thing by going to therapy and just talking when I needed to continue to work on some of my triggers and reactions. I just don't know what to do. I feel like I failed my wife and daughter, and the situation after divorce makes me feel sick. My wife would have to go back to work, and the apartments she can afford aren't great. I feel like I am casting my wife and daughter into turmoil and a shit life and childhood. Obviously, I would pay child support, but it still puts us in a possibly terrible living situation. I'm terrified to talk to her again. I feel disgusted that my wife would rather live like that than give me a last chance. We have to sell our house, and we will be able to pay off our debt, which was another stressor for us, along with clutter. I just wish we could sell the house and pay the debt and have a fresh start where I do the treatment continuously and do the things I completely failed her and be supportive of her. I love her more than anything, and I'm sorry that I failed her so many times, I can do better because she deserves it.	i-fd-up	follow-up	na	na	na	0.992202877998352	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
Unfortunately I was too stupid to realize the depth of the hole I had dug over the last months. I knew things weren't great, i knew i needed to go back to the program and was trying to figure out what was wrong and I was reading  about ways to make her feel better and was going to ask to take her on a date since we have had no alone time outside the house in 2 years iwanted to show her i was willing to do things outside of my comfort zone by going to a concert or event she would like. But my communication failed me and kept asking her what was wrong, and she told me things weren't working out and that she didn't want to do this again in 5 years, she stayed 2 times already, I worked on improving things but I was never perfect. I wish she would give me time and file the divorce but put on hold so I can show her how serious I am about making these changes, I need to be a better husband, father, and person and I can be, especially for her.	i-fd-up	follow-up	na	na	na	0.992202877998352	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
Yeah, I'm not sure she'll listen, but I can try to talk again. I've been trying to just do the things on the list because if I just say I'll do them, it's an empty promise and does nothing. It's been hard to bring it up because I feel like I have one shot at this conversation and I don't think I can handle it if she says no again youre not worth my time, you've been nothing but a disaster for the last decade and been a cancer on my life why would I give you yet another chance to mess up. I do think having a child was definitely a change and I don't think I properly recalibrated afterwards and my wife is the one, once again who paid the price. I don't like being like this. And I know I can't going like this or it'll start effecting my daughter too. All I know is that I love her more than anything and she gave me the most beautiful daughter and carried me through the hardest times in my life with no questions  but now  I would like to be the one who can support her, she deserves to not have to constantly worry if she can count on me that day or my mood.

No problem,  this is the one place i figured I could try to get some advice until i start treatments, I did find one book called ptsd and relationships by Diana giorgetti last night so I ordered that along with some other books. Plus, I've gotten some good advice here that I hope will help. I know I can be better and.   have gotten better over the years but I realize I can't just let myself fall back on old coping mechanisms that always bring me down or get complacent with treatment and I need to be proactive in treating my ptsd  and keep  up with treatments that target my biggest personal failings and triggers and not let the fact I struggle effect her so negatively. I have my first mindfulness group in a few hours, and I hope that too will be a help. I love my wife more than anything, and I just wish I had shown her through my actions.	i-fd-up	follow-up	na	na	na	0.992202877998352	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
It was a huge punch to my gut and that feeling hasn't left. I don't know what you're insinuating about her being like ex and using that word, but I can assure you she is nothing like your ex. She is kind,funny, and extremely smart and caring to a fault. I don't see any parallels between our situations other than or partners are sick of us except I would do anything I can to improve myself and be the best partner and father I can be. So  I don't what your ex has done to you and you don't know my wife so get that word out of your head, she's never been one and isnt  being one now and never will be.  just stop.	i-fd-up	follow-up	na	na	na	0.992202877998352	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
Damn, have you asked her about filing and putting it on hold while you work your ass off to show her you know whats at stake and you can demonstrate your dedication to improving yourself? And if you don't make the changes needed it's already filed?

I mean I have the list, that I keep adding to, otherwise her filing and letting me prove i am capable of change and will do anything to keep her and our family. Then it's me going to the 6 week program, then staying in a focused therapy based on communication as well as a general talk therapy and groups always.  Selling the house and paying off our debts and starting fresh with no bills and no clutter. Becoming responsible for my own stuff as much as possible so her being a caretaker is not an added stress and being the one to support her . Otherwise I have no idea how to ask her about this.

"I went to my first mindfulness group today, and I learned some techniques for recognizing and changing my judgemental actions, postures, and tones. This is one of the things I am going to focus on with my doctor each month. I enjoyed the group actually because everyone there is in a similar position in life, to varying degrees. My doctor leads this group, and I've worked with her in the past. I told her that I always struggle with communication and have been messing it up my entire life, and it's something I need to change. I have to stop holding everything inside and lashing out towards the ones who I love. My2 wife doesn't deserve that stress and anxiety. I realized too late the immense stress she was under from every aspect of life. Her family life has always been rocky, and speak  had to be the grown-up from an early age. To this day, herbfamily is hectic, and she's the one who has to pick up the pieces, and that's stress. We have a 2 year old who is so amazing, but raising a child is a huge stress. Then there is me. I have fucked up so many ways and she is my caregiver and I never fully expressed my gratitude for her constant help. I helped with our child as much as possible, and I would help her with her family when needed, but I forgot to help myself after our baby was born and didnt realize the culmination of stress stacked on top of her and the negative effect I had on her. I messed up a lot. I messed up my proposal to her, I wanted to take her to the bar and Dennys we went to on our first date. We were getting ready to head out, but she got a horrible migraine and had to lay down, so we decided to stay in instead. She was on the bed and I was getting changed and I dropped the ring box and was pretty sure she saw it. so then I panicked and got down on one knee and asked her to marry me and she said yes. In my head, I was thinking it's like the wedding vow ""in sickness and in health,"" which she has no idea about. I have never told her, and she probably thinks it was the lamest proposal ever. I just kept fucking up from there. Early on, I was resistant to any real help and limped on with her carrying me. I thought I was serious about getting help when I did inpatient care last time but I didn't realize how easy it is to backslide if you dont keep tabs on it, it's like diabetes you can just check blood sugar every 6 months and be okay and I am fault for not realizing that, but I do know. I think the words will be meaningless without showing her that I can improve independently first. Me saying I'll do this or that means nothing, but I hope my love for her is evident as I try my best to improve."	i-fd-up	follow-up	na	na	na	0.992202877998352	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
Yes you're right your actions and demonstration of the change you need to make to be a happy healthy partner will probably speak louder than any words but I think it will still help to have something articulate and meaningful to say when you do finally talk to her.

Yea, I'm still working on how and what to say. It's so hard, I am a quiet person and awkward. She was the first girl I ever dated without actually knowing them first. We met on a dating site, and I saw her picture and had been drinking just enough to muster up the courage to send her a message. When she actually messaged me back, I panicked because I never expected for her to notice me, let alone respond. We talked for a while and she invited me to come down to her place one weekend. I drove the 2.5 hours to meet her and made it to her place, and I froze. I couldn't get out of my truck. I was confident as a Marine because I knew what I was doing, and I excelled at it and got promoted faster than my peers. In social situations, especially with people, I don't know I'm a wreck. In the truck, all I was thinking about were all the different possibilities on the other side of that door. Some bad, most good, and I know I thought what if it's your future wife on the other side of the door and you're sitting 10 yards away too afraid to find out. So I left quickly and bought some Jack Daniel's and took a couple shots in her parking lot to muster up enough courage to knock on the door. She was so warm and inviting, and some of the stress immediately melted away. I was still nervous but in a good way. We went dancing all night, and she didn't seem to care. I was terrible at it, either. She was sweet and funny and just made me feel better. We went to a Dennys that night and had a funny encounter and talked for a while. It was the best date I've ever been on. I don't know. I just feel like something about her gave me the courage when i put myself out there  and followed through. It was something I had never done  before. It's not just her beauty or sense of humor or intelligence, I don't know what it is, but I don't want to lose it. I can't lose it. She knows what reddit is and probably clicks links to it from time to time. Why? If she saw this? Well then I think I'd be even more fucked than I am now and even more embarrassed. I think I've kept things vague enough that I'm not sharing our personal details with the world i just dont have anyone in my life that i can talk to about this right now. Before this, instead of talking to someone or saving things for my once monthly therapy appointment. I would just ball all of this up in my head and ruminate on it until it bursts out. I just needed to get some guidance until my therapy  and groups start. I got my talk therapy session on Sept 18th and focused on communication therapy on the 29th and 3 groups I can attend. I just need to focus on those all setup. Now im doing the things on my list to prove I'm serious and that I love her enough to fix my faults.Every time I see her, I want to say I love you, and when we are with our daughter playing around, I don't want it to end. I don't want separate holidays i want to be better. I want to be someone she can lean on without worrying if I'll collapse. I don't want to be a failure or disappointment in her eyes. I should have realized a lot of stuff before now, but I didn't, and I want to apologize for being so blind and so selfish. I just get so nervous around her. She is nice to me but I think it's only because she wants to be done with me. We're getting the house ready to sell, and I've been trying to be proactive on that. She made this really beautiful 2 tiered display of our wedding date and other wedding items that I really love. It's on the kitchen table, and we've taken almost every decoration down in the kitchen, but it's still standing, and i just sit and look at it and think about every little thing ive fucked up over and over. I'm worried that once it comes down, it'll be the last time I see it. I built the 2 tier display to her design specs and she stained it and made custom pieces and I just don't know what I'll do if she just chucks it in the donate bin or worse the trash.	i-fd-up	follow-up	na	na	na	0.992202877998352	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
It's evident you love her truly and deeply, have you ever shared any of these sentiments or feelings with her or do you bottle those in too? You should try letting her in, tell her about the engagment and how you panicked, tell her how much you love the wedding display and how special it is to you. I found this video a while back and thought he had some interesting takes on ptsd and communication and he's a combat vet too [check it out](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5ah7GVjfr3U&pp=ygUUQXNraG9sZSB2ZXRlcmFuIHB0c2Q%3D)	i-fd-up	reply	na	na	na	0.992202877998352	weak	no	strong	na	ptsd	failed
I do love her more than anything, to the moon and back (thats what we would say), and I wish I learned how to communicate in a healthy way so that she never had to wonder if i did love her or why does someone who says i love you talk to th3m like that. I get so tied up in my thoughts that by the time I try to express them, I can't do it in a coherent manner and become self conscious about them and hold them in. I don't know how to even tell her about the engagement story or if she would be upset by it. I'm scared to tell her anything because i dont want to push her away. I just want to say I love you again.  She hasn't taken the wedding display down yet and I'm afraid she is just going to throw it away. I wish I could show my wife that video to show my mindset at times but show her how I want to fix it.	i-fd-up	follow-up	na	na	na	0.992202877998352	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

"Hi all, idk how to word it correctly, and also english isnt my first languange so excuses in advance.

Ive got CPTSD. And i notice that i often forget what i am/or was thinking about. It could be an innocent thing, and i notice it happens when something ""sudden"" happens in a calm situation. Like a pen falling, a customer asking something, something like that.

For some reason i always have to think about that and repeat the thoughts multipule times in my head. Kinda replay the situation for some reason. Its really distracting sometimes.

Example: ""the costumur asked me where this was. He asked me where thi- (what? Huh? ...) the costumer asked me where( .. what?) He asked me where the product was. Ok. He asked me where it was""

 i have to rethink the situation because i can can give it ""closure""
And i must think about it alone in without distractions (other people talking to me).

I hope you guys understood what i meant. Do more people experience this? Does anyone know what this is? Thanks in advance. Love."	macyliene	post	16.758927437848925	male	White	0.016694892197847366	na	na	na	7	ptsd	no prediction.

"For clarification, and then some backstory: 

Not just any therapy, but one that is a process.
 I have been in prolonged exposure therapy for the last 18 months, and I am about 2/3 of the way through my therapy. I am lucky, and very grateful to know that I have an amazing support system. Nonetheless, this morning I realized I have never spoken with someone who has completed therapy for PTSD. I love life, and I am never going to give up on my therapy. I am closer to the finish than I am from the starting line, and I do feel more freedom than I ever have before. I am making this post out of curiosity, and wonder of what post-therapy life is like. I am treating myself well - meditation, exercise, more healthy food in my diet, herbal teas. Practicing opposite-action while remaining mindful of my emotions. Sometimes the mental, emotional, and physical exhaustion just really gets to me.

"Yes! I've never done the kind of therapy to which you're referring but was with my therapist for 7 years, after a slew of bad experiences with therapists and a long time of thinking I could scrape by on medication alone (Narrator: She could not.) I'm not going to sit here and tell you it cured me for life or ""fixed"" me, but life did get better after I was able to work through a bunch of shit with someone experienced, based, whom I trusted and who made me feel heard. It took a long time for me to realize this though, longer than I care to admit.

"My mother is dying due to brain metastases developed from lung cancer, and this is very likely her last few days.
We have support from doctors and nurses who come home 2-3 times a week, because they can’t find any hospice care structure for her, and probably will not find it in time.

The thing is that in the last 3 days my mother’s conditions got really worse really fast, and she’s now close to being a vegetable except her eyes look weird and her mouth keeps twitching (she eventually developed epilepsy), and all of this is really painful to look at, especially considering she only had a little trouble speaking until a few days ago.

I can’t even know if she understands what is happening around her or not, and i’m giving her morphine to make sure she has no pain since she can’t communicate.

Earlier this morning i cried a few times after spending some time with her by her bed, and i’m now genuinely hoping for her everything will be over really soon.

How can i tell if this is just a really painful experience or am developing PTSD? And is there anything i can do to avoid it? I really don’t want these images of my mother haunting me in the future, that’s not the kind of memory i want to have of her."	mattex93	post	12.952758123092869	female	White	0.9934942126274109	na	na	na	3	ptsd	no prediction.

Here is the author's story:  
""Several years ago, I was very suicidal and had little hope, and therapy and medication alone weren't providing me with the help I needed. I did extensive research on what neuroscience and psychology tips could help me and created a formula for myself to use based on that research. With those steps, I was able to reduce my suicidal thoughts drastically - for years, I had them daily, and now I rarely have any.  
I put the formula I used into the format of a 'game.' When I say 'game,' I don't mean that it's trivial or supposed to be fun all the time. It's really just a way to frame it and approach it with strategies and tips that help get past life's obstacles to the 'level' you want to get to.""

"This began in my late teens but has become slightly more frequent as the years have gone on (I'm now mid-30s). I don't know if it's related to PTSD but I can't think of anything else.

It has happened in a variety of settings: at school, at home, at work, etc. I'll give 2 examples.

1. I was at my dad's house living in a mostly finished basement. I walked out of my bedroom into the rest of the apartment, saw the doors (one to outside, one to upstairs) and I was immediately lost. I didn't know where I was, where the doors led to, if anyone else was or should be there, etc. I was hopelessly lost for a short time before I tried one of the doors. Once I was upstairs, I came to my senses.

2. At work, I would be in the middle of my shift, and I would suddenly realize that I was again lost and didn't know anyone around me or myself. I could still do my job and I knew I was among coworkers because our shirts matched. However, I felt like I had never seen them before and I didn't know if I was close to anyone, the time my shift should end, etc. I also wasn't sure of my name, address, history, or age. I wanted to ask someone to take me to the hospital but I waited to see if my memory would come back, and it did.

I understand this subreddit is not for medical advice, and I'm not seeking any. I'm just curious if anyone else here experiences this or if anyone knows if this is part of PTSD. I know that at some point during my childhood, my mother had amnesia, but she's also a drug addict so I'm not sure if this was something I could have inherited from her to some extent."

"Yeah, I had that during the worst time of my symptoms. I was under a lot of stress, so my symptoms were horrible. 
I had light amnesia, and scary amnesia
 Both were for a short time, where I totally forgot everything, the scary one was with the bonus of total dread.

"My relatively new SO is a survivor of SA and DV and I'm trying to understand her needs as best I can. She's currently very stressed about money. I am trying to be a good partner and offer help any way I can (I'm living out of savings right now and don't have a lot of money to give) but it seems that anything I say is the wrong thing. She lashes out at me for having a supportive family and speaks to me in ways that are intentionally hurtful.

It's very difficult to talk to her about her anger because she stays in these resentful rages for hours at a time, sometimes to later apologize. Anyway, I just got The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk in hopes that I can find ways to communicate with her better when she's struggling. It breaks my heart to see her in these fits when I know she doesn't want to hurt me but can't seem to help it.

I don't know if I explained that very well. I try to just keep a level head and let her know I care about her because she feels ashamed when she calms down. Anyway, do you folks have any advice?"	CoffeeAndDrawing	post	27.95638833675171	male	White	0.9954160451889038	na	na	na	54	ptsd	failed

Anger is definitely a part of PTSD. There are actually lots of symptoms of PTSD that people don’t really think about because it affects every part of a person and a person’s life. However, just because she has PTSD doesn’t mean she can take it out on you. She should be grateful for you that you are so supportive, and it saying sorry doesn’t mean anything if she doesn’t show any kind of change. Sometimes couples have problems but if this is a common thing for her to lash out on you then I think that that would qualify as abuse. Just because you want to be supportive of her and her PTSD doesn’t mean you have to put up with abuse.	CoffeeAndDrawing	reply	na	na	na	0.9954160451889038	no	no	no	na	ptsd	failed
"Anger to the point of rage is a common symptom of PTSD. It is a sign that things are getting worse though.This can make things difficult on those that care about people suffering from PTSD. It's tough because this is something that is partly out of her control. She needs to find ways to address it though or it will hurt those around her.

What you described sounds like things have gotten really bad for her. She needs help, probably more help than you can give her alone. Hopefully you can work together to build a network of support. It's great that you want to work with her, but remember that she's going to have to do the bulk of the work herself.

If you are consistently being mistreated, you aren't obligated to put up with it either. Your care is admirable to a point. Make sure you and your boundaries are being respected.

Hello, myself a person diagnosed with PTSD did exactly this with my partner. You need to approach very carefully to have a chat with them. Let them take their time, have breaks if it’s too intense etc. before you start you need to say, I want to talk to you, what I say might upset or anger you, but I need to tell you how I am feeling and I need you to know so we can move on together for both of us. I want us to be happy and healthy together and I want nothing but the best for you. Then go into your chat. It can be very difficult being in these relationships. Only you can decide if it’s worth staying in or not, not the people in the comments who have no idea of context. They are right you are not her therapist. She probably doesn’t realise her behaviours or how their impacting you and is obviously struggling herself.

"It is definitely a symptom, myself included. 

She sounds like she needs outside help from a therapist who specializes in trauma. Slow and steady. Learn to calm down again and not be in constant panic (which comes out as anger and can be volatile and dangerous - I feel for you).

One thing that has changed my life has been **practicing restorative yoga** especially for the hips and spine. My hips were so locked up and I had no idea. I've cried multiple times. 

Use caution, though. It did unlock repressed memories for me - and frankly, I was someone who used to generally not believe in real repressed memories. 

I do simple yoga or stretching for at least 10/15 minutes every day (usually I'll do 30 min). Changes my whole day.

Best of luck to you both"	CoffeeAndDrawing	reply	na	na	na	0.9954160451889038	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"You sound like you’re doing all the right things on your side! The rest is up to her to get better. It’s a horrible truth but my partner has learned the hard way that you can’t love PTSD out of existence (although from my experience love does make it more bearable) often sufferers have to go the long, hard way round to heal 

Unconditional love, patience and understanding are the way to go but, remember, if she ever steps out of line remind her of your boundaries and restate what is and isn’t acceptable behaviour towards you (firm but gentle- you can be upset with what she’s done and reassure her you won’t leave at the same time) 

I wish you all the best!

"Anger is a symptom for sure, but whether anger is a symptom of PTSD in her case is something that can only be diagnosed and treated by professionals if she wants to recover. Self directed anger is dangerous to herself, but anger directed outwards may still amount to abuse. Love alone won't help her but she is lucky to have you near. Take care of yourself and know your limits..it's ok to step away and let her rage.

A professional would run a battery of tests, including tests for ADHD, ASD, and perhaps a personality questionnaire to determine whether there is an underlying disorder. There would be an enquiry into whether there is a family history of depression, anxiety or other conditions, or brain damage, complicated by CSA, or substance use disorders. A person may have comorbidities of more than one diagnosis as well. It is not a good idea to accept a self diagnosis on face value. Be sure that this is what she has before you commit to helping her. The treatment must be tailored and it won't be by you.

Even after a diagnosis is made there is significant work to do. It is personal and not something that can be done for her.  Until she is in a mental place to do something about it, the kindest thing you can do is be near, listen, and check her behaviour gently when it goes too far. Also, there have to be consequences for bad behaviour. You are not there to save her or fix her.

If she does have PTSD, it is possible that interpersonal stresses can set her off. It's not something that you can adapt to without compromising yourself. You may become traumatised and develop your own stress response. My experience is that people with PTSD are not lazy, but are overwhelmed with thoughts and activity. They desperately want to be regulated or get back to how they used to be. There is maladaptation which has left them in survival mode, but it kept them alive and was useful. They are often protectors in society, or become overprotective after trauma They feel incredibly guilty for hurting others, or not being able to control someone else's hurts, and become very critical of themselves. Shame, anger and sadness/fear are a daily cycle attending their dealings with people and situations.

You are not a therapist. Do not try to be your partners therapist. Your partner needs professional support from someone who is trained in the area of PTSD.

Talk about getting therapeutic support for them and be supportive in that. PTSD doesn't go away on its own. Repressing it only makes it last longer.

As for your situation, I ain't sugarcoating it but here's what you should do. First of all, when she's angry don't take her words to heart. She's not her. What you want to be is calm and supportive. Don't contradict her when she's angry, you're just adding fuel to the fire. But don't let her do anything too rash. Hug her if she lets you and tell her to focus on her breathing and solely on that.

"I completely hear everything you’re saying , but in a romantic relationship ‘not taking someone’s words to heart’ is so hard, especially if the person on the receiving end of the verbal attack is a sensitive individual. Ex. Me being called a stupid bitch (very light on the scale of things I could’ve mentioned lol) by an SO in the moment of his issues, hurt my core, regardless if it was just ‘words’ and flowers came next. Accepting someone lashing out over and over will in turn break that other person down, and create an environment where that behavior is ok. So some sort of boundary and hard line HAS to be drawn, otherwise walking all over someone will just become the norm; Walking on eggshells is no way to live for anyone. And no one in a romantic relationship should carry the burden of making sure their partner doesn’t do ‘anything too rash’, that is an immense burden to take on. Being a supportive partner is everything, but carrying the weight of trying to make sure someone else doesn’t make life damaging decisions is very toxic and unhealthy. She is a woman dealing with deep pain and I do NOT diminish that, she absolutely deserves and needs love, support and empathy. I just think that anyone going through those things needs a healthy outlet outside of their partners/parents/etc to have objective conversations,, so that they can try to work on healing the wounds internally, and by doing so we hope to grow and learn, and over time we can slowly cut people less and less… Because our partners aren’t our enemies, they are on our side; we just innately take things out on the people we love the most. Her words of vitriol aren’t stemming from a hatred of her partner, but that of deeper wounds that haven’t been dealt with; (I’ve dealt with lots of trauma, abuse, the whole shmorgasboard so I can see both sides in a way)

And that still wasn't okay, and has never been repeated since.

It's not that I don't feel that rage. It's that I've hacked out ways to anticipate being about to lose control, so I can avoid the situation. Go lie down, shut up for a sec until I can figure out exactly what to say, go take a bathroom break if we're somewhere in public, etc.

Hi, I was diagnosed with PTSD and depression last year. Last week I had, for about five days, recurring and obsssesive thoughts. It started as being exited for a date, constantly thinking about this person, bring very happy every time they messaged me, and then being very sad when they didn't (not as in ghosting, as in they didn't reply for an hour and I just somehow felt like the worst person in the world) just constant thoughts and mood around this person that I barely know. At some point, maybe after the date itself which was just OK. It turned into obsssesive thoughts about myself, just how disgusting I am and some more really really bad thoughts about myself that I'll spare you lol. I could barely function because of this throughout the whole week, all my mind could think about was this and it took so much energy from me. Anyway, idk how to call this? Is this a panic attack? Is it a PTSD symptom? Please help.	noetshep	post	22.822673931506447	male	White	0.998783528804779	na	na	na	8	ptsd	no prediction.

Yeah, intrusive thoughts can lead to you spiraling. What I have been told to do to handle intrusive thoughts is to cognitively label the thoughts as intrusive and not thoughts of my own free will. This makes them easier to filter out of my head.	noetshep	reply	na	na	na	0.998783528804779	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
I can always identify intrusive thought but not able to ignore them 😢😢 so far what works best for me is to watch some funny or interesting videos or shows to distract myself from the thoughts but it becomes unhealthy for me to watch too many useless videos 😢😢	noetshep	reply	na	na	na	0.998783528804779	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
Yes, while it's happening I don't identify it as something else- like it's just my thoughts. Like I can't just ignore it or flag it unfortunately- it's like a storm, I only realized how extreme it was when it was done.

It takes time to identify and acknowledge them, handling them effectively is another skill.

I've been going to a phycologist for the last two years, she's on vacation now... She always thought these stuff are like my trauma bc they can be triggered from the smallest things. I haven't had a spiraling like this for a few months and last week it really hit me like a brick lol. Forgot how awful it is.

"And I don’t necessarily mean self confidence, either, because there are lots of things that I feel confident about. The thing is, is that I feel like growing up with abuse shaped the way I talk to myself a lot, like with the inner critic I guess is what its called. Since not being around my family(especially my dad) and doing what I needed to do for myself, I’ve actually noticed it get better, which is why I want to keep working on it. 

Sometimes I feel like you don’t notice how bad you feel until you’re removed from the situation, and especially since having more alone time and reflection I’ve stopped myself and wondered why I thought like that. It feels like a lot of my inner critic or self talk is just remnants of my dads abuse that I haven’t been able to let go of. He was really good at making me feel worthless, and that I didn’t know anything, that I couldn’t do anything right(like even literally hovering over me yelling at every tiny spot I missed cleaning the house even when I was in 5th grade so like now I feel bad even when I’m just cleaning things by myself), and that I was a lazy pig, and would yell at me to stop crying every time he would yell at us or scream at us and other things, and honestly really any insult you can think of that I just learned to be true. 

I forget that that’s not normal and there are healthier ways to talk to yourself too. I’m really glad that I was able to get away and do what I needed to do for myself but I don’t know how to go on with my life. Between PTSD and transphobia I’m always just waiting for the next thing to break me, and I feel like I’m almost afraid of being happy, too, because my dad would do this a lot where we were honestly just punished any time we were happy. Any holiday, birthday, or anything fun or any achievement, he always had to ruin it and so now I’d rather just not feel anything, or put myself down before something terrible happens. My thought process is: We need to balance out this happiness with something sad before something terrible happens. Like that’s the logic in my mind but yeah I’m trying to not expect catastrophe after positive self talk or anything happy idk if that makes sense"	bubbles244434	post	14.264328963818615	female	White	0.017960404977202415	na	na	na	5	ptsd	no prediction.

I imagine what I would say to a friend, a stranger and compare the two. Took years and years of therapy. Another commenter mentioned their faith and I have to include that as well. It’s almost impossible to have healthy self talk when you’re in the dark depths of depression but outside of a severe depression it helps. If it’s related to my abuse, I picture myself as that little girl and I lovingly mother her. So much of it is catching it - if you can catch yourself in the middle of it and switch the mindset - that’s when it works and becomes the new habit, the new voice.	bubbles244434	reply	na	na	na	0.017960404977202415	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"My wife and I are each making lists of the things we need to hear when we’re at our lowest points.

It’s a bit uncomfortable for me to access those low points in order to figure out what I need to hear at the time but I think personalized reassurance is a great way too soothe or be soothed.

We both talk down to/belittle ourselves too often and we would never let other people talk to us the way we, ourselves, do to us.

"Greetings, fellow Redditors,
  

  
I hope this post finds you all in good health and spirits. As a lawyer, I wanted to share my journey and seek advice from this supportive community. Approximately 8 months ago, I found myself in a distressing situation, having been let go by a toxic manager and business owner. Today, I am grateful to have transitioned into a much healthier work environment with supportive colleagues and bosses.
  

  
I'm writing this post not only to vent out my feelings but also to reach out to those who might have faced similar challenges or have insights to share. My former workplace was marked by bullying and harassment from my manager/business owner, which led me to experience considerable emotional strain. While I studied PTSD during law school, I never fully comprehended its impact until I lived through it. Even now, 8 months later, I find myself grappling with debilitating flashbacks that manifest as breathing difficulties and other mental health issues.
  

  
Recent developments in my health, including a diagnosis of heart conditions, have led me to question whether the tumultuous environment of my previous workplace played a role. This post serves as an avenue for me to open up about my experiences and seek advice from individuals who may have insights on overcoming PTSD. I am fully aware that recovery is a gradual process, but any guidance would be greatly appreciated.
  

  
In the past, my old manager would engage in troubling behavior, such as exploiting candidates for free work under the guise of interviews and later mock their efforts. He would often belittle my colleagues and me, imposing unreasonable tasks like ordering breakfast and making his beverages, despite the demanding nature of our legal work. His micromanagement extended to scrutinizing every detail, leading to undue stress over minor issues. I vividly recall him saying he would shoot me if he had a gun—an absolutely horrifying experience that left me feeling trapped and fearful.
  

  
Regrettably, my experiences were further marred by his inappropriate comments and threats. His proclamations of connections and expertise contrasted sharply with his reality, as he frequently relied on others for solutions. Furthermore, he manipulated clients, seizing them from fellow lawyers and eventually mistreating them. The volatile nature of his behavior only intensified my struggle with PTSD.
  

  
Amidst this turmoil, I found solace in the fact that I now work in a supportive environment. However, the scars of my previous experiences continue to affect me. If anyone has navigated a similar path or has advice on how to cope with PTSD and regain emotional well-being, I would be incredibly grateful for your insights. Let's foster a space for healing, understanding, and sharing.
  

  
Thank you for taking the time to read my story and for being a part of this compassionate community."	AnonymousGreatPTSD	post	31.12730164789103	male	White	0.0033854367211461067	na	na	na	1	ptsd	no prediction.

Short answer: no. You can not have PTSD without trauma. In utero is basically the only spot you are virtually safe. That being said, there are genetic factors that come into play.

Last night i was in a serious head on car collision. I spent the night in hospital and was released this morning. The whole night I had nightmares of me killing the other driver (they’re not dead). The impact keeps replaying and replaying, I feel like I can’t function. I feel constant shock. Sitting in the passenger seat on the ride home I flinched at every car that passed us and every corner we took. I still smell the smoke.

"I'm so sorry! That's a lot of tough stuff to go through. Glad that you're out of the hospital now, and the other person is OK. 

I've been in car accidents that were pretty scary, but I was the only one who got hurt, and it wasn't my fault (an object on the road popped the tire on my car & some others, and we all crashed into different sides of the highway). Still, I couldn't get into a car at all for months afterward, without feeling nauseated and/or throwing up. Any sensation where I felt movement that was out of control, like escalators or elevators, was triggering. When I was able to drive again, I was constantly looking for objects in the road and being hypervigilant.

But it did eventually get better. It took maybe 1-2 years for me to finally feel normal in cars again. The length of time it takes to heal, will vary for everyone, but now I love driving again, and I'm an extremely safe driver as a result of this.

"i want to first say i am diagnosed with PTSD by my therapist who i have seen for several years. when i was 12, my parents had a brutal divorce. i was always jealous of my brothers friends who’s parents were at least civil with each other. i will never forget sitting in my therapists waiting room for maybe the second or third time with my mom and brother and my dad walking through the door and just screaming at her. i won’t forget the time that mom actually came to my dads door to get us one time before we went on a plane to florida and he slammed the door in her face, re opened it and got to her level to quietly yell at her. my dad is not a bad person, neither is my mom. but my mom did fuck up their marriage. 
my mom was raised by a bipolar maniac and a lot of her moms tendencies and attitudes transferred over, i know her mother had PTSD from the native american reservation she was on. i know my mother has PTSD from being in the troubled teen industry, for being raised borderline poverty level in texas, for her chemo and cancer treatments that weakened her marriage to my dad. i know she turned into an angry person to my dad, a sometimes manipulative human. i think a major factor was towards the end of their marriage, she started a relationship while married with a long time family friend. we aren’t allowed to say his name near my dad.
my dad was raised by two really terrible people. his dad was so angry all the time and never wanted to be a father, constant yelling and screaming. my young childhood had a lot of that still. my parents are both headstrong people who met by being coworkers (professors)
when i started therapy, i had massive amounts of anxiety. i got sick every time they had to contact each other for something, and i was always the mediator or person in the middle (i was 13)
they fought over who picked up my medication
they fought over who would take us on vacations (even when married, traveling out of the country was always a big deal and something we did a lot)
they argued over stupid shit. it wasn’t until i had a panic attack when they had to meet at the hospital together for my brothers foot surgery that my therapist diagnosed me with PTSD. 
i still have panic attacks years later when they have to talk to each other. my brothers bar mitzvah is coming up so they will have to correspond, i get frequent anxiety attacks for that. 
i don’t know a lot about my PTSD. i had someone once tell me i didn’t have it because only people who have seen terrible things like army or refugees could have it. no my parents were not physically abusive to anyone but they were emotionally abusive and manipulative."	moobunnys	post	22.153561484424465	female	White	0.9975103139877319	na	na	na	2	ptsd	'ethnicity: mixed (part native american), age: late teens to early 20s, gender: not specified, explanation: the author mentions their mother having ptsd from a native american reservation, suggesting partial native american heritage. the timing of their parents' divorce and the mention of their therapist, anxiety, and their brother's upcoming bar mitzvah suggest they are likely still a teenager or in their early 20s. the text does not specify the author's gender.'

Yep, I spend about half my time in denial, sure that I must have made everything up. But I quite literally still have the scars and they tell the story.	an9iiiiiiiline	reply	na	na	na	0.9985805749893188	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
Yeah I deal with this a lot too. It doesn't help that as a kid, my dad would always say I was lying when I wasn't, or would believe what his girlfriend's kids would say instead of me, things like that. It's also why I rarely tell people that I have ptsd, I only really talk about my problems with my partner and my therapist.	an9iiiiiiiline	reply	na	na	na	0.9985805749893188	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
Mine is from 9/11 so I’m not convinced it’s made up. I know what I experienced and seen	an9iiiiiiiline	reply	na	na	na	0.9985805749893188	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
I understand that. I forgot my trauma for a long time (is that even possible? It's probably just another way I made it up) and as I began to remember it, it felt as if I were making up the facts, telling a story from a 3rd body perspective. But I still have physical reactions from it and have the diagnosis and am getting therapy. Our brains are wacky as man -_-	an9iiiiiiiline	reply	na	na	na	0.9985805749893188	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
So to start I am 25 m . I've struggled with ptsd for a few years starting from taking care of my grandma when she was dying. Shortly after that i tried to take my own life (several times) all of which has failed and has made it worse. I got better after 7 or 8 years of coping with it. But in till Dec 2021 I had met this girl threw some friend and things where great she was the one I think. A few mo th go by and she ends up being pregnant but not with my kid but her ex. I agreed to father the child and I was thrilled more than I could explain. After two months of her pregnancy I found out she was cheating on me with her coworker, I enturn kicked her out but set her up in a hotel so she wouldn't be homeless and paid for each of her nights and meals so that way I knew she was eating and her and the baby where healthy. Come may of 2022 we had talked about moving to WI in oder to fix our issues and start a new life. The moment we got there she turned 180° and started mentally abusing me and got help from her mom as well as it looked pretty bleack I stuck it out for a few month and then the baby was born. 4lbs 4oz at 7:14 at night late June or early July. And I was in love with the baby who I called my own daughter and she would use it against me telling me she isn't mine and yelling at me eventide I went to feed or change her. She would sometimes purposely state the fact that the baby was not mine and that there wasn't anything I could do to prove to her it was. She would also talk crap and try and isolate me from my parents and it worked. Once she had done that it got worse she got worse her mom got worse. She would tell me she don't want to kiss me cause she doesn't know if she loves me and told me that I was pretty much there to take care of her and her baby and I had no where to go. One night the baby choked and was unresponsive we both noticed and the moment I got up to help she yelled at me to not touch her baby and she would get her from choking and I told her how to do it with out breaking bones or causing any more damage. It broke me to watch my step daughter as I still call her choke and go limp at the age of 4 month old. She lived with no issues but my ex yelled at me for not doing anything or helping during that time she started to get physical and so did her mom. I work at a big factory in the town we lived in and over the next few weeks everything from the melting aluminum to the stares where looking really friendly. I thought about going out on my own terms just about everyday and I had no escape they took control of my bank account and made it where I had no money to get a bike or mode of transportation other than them. Towards the last 3 weeks I lived there I had lost 35lbs from only eating bagles and eggs or what ever my coworks could spare as 3 of them knew of my situation. One day my brother called and k ew something was wrong because he could tell that out conversation was being listed to as they had been doing to make sure I wasn't asking for help or had anyway to leave. He got me out of there after the phone call cause he heard they where going to church as I was leaving I realized not everyone had gone her uncle stayed behind to make sure I was staying in the basement as I was off work that day and didn't have a reason to be upstairs. I'm glad he had health issues and had to use the bathroom cause I took that moment to run I left my keys my boots and toothbrush there ended up at an air port 40 min away from help with my brother and family. I spent the night there sleeping in the break room there as the employees figured out what had happened and had a cop and sherif stand watch making sure I was not being looked for. I'm thankful for the employees from the airport and the 2 cops that stayed and kept me safe. The morning I landed back in Colorado I had gotten a call from the cops saying that they had a run in with her mom and that they where worried about me cause I wasn't home and figured they would check the airport as it was the only place they would think I could get to. I've been back in Colorado for Lmost a year in October and every night I now have nightmare of the baby choking and my ex and her mom constantly abusing me and I'm getting tired of it I want it to end its getting to the point the smell of rain is setting me off as well as the sound buddies new borns coos.  He has offered to let me hold her but I can't I look at his daught and I think I'm just back there and this is all a dream. I'm terrified to sleep and I'm terrified to be awake. I'm sorry this is so long  but I need to get this put there and reach for some sort of help.

"Trigger warning ( sexual assault ) - not sure how much I can say on here. I hope I don't offend.

When I was ages 15 to 18 I was subjected to a horrendous time by my then partner and family.

I was assaulted both physically and sexually, I had 2 abortions and went full term with 1 pregnancy .
My child was sexually assaulted by family member of my then partner.
There was some other awful stuff but I am guessing you get the point. 

I went through counseling etc and my life worked out great, successful, 2  more children, beautiful house etc.

That was 35 years ago - lately I am having some issues now with relationships and I am saying things unintentionally that hurt people I love.

Anytime I discuss this with my partner my input  alway heads back to the family that caused me so much hurt.

My partner loves and supports me and truly 'gets' my journey - he has studied mental health part time and feels I may be struggling with PTSD or CPTSD due to the issues in my younger years.... I am really scared to take any steps as I don't want to relive the past .

Is there anyone here that could offer some insight/advise/guidance? 

Thank you for taking the time to read and or comment."	Consistent_Wash_961	post	47.64693085878865	female	White	0.013143029995262623	na	na	na	2	ptsd	no prediction.

"So I had an uncomfortable ugly-crying moment with my mom recently. I've been going through really bad PTSD flashbacks recently, and have been crying for hours every day, uncontrollably. I had to cancel our vacation together, because of it.

And I know she means well, but now she's texting me constantly, being very sympathetic and overly attentive, and it's just too much.

I want to explain to her that this is different from someone who is just temporarily sad, and needs a hug or consoling. This is a reaction that I can't control, that has been going on every day for years, and that I need to process on my own. I need her to understand that she's not helping by reminding me of my own symptoms. 

Does anyone have ideas of how to phrase this, or resources I can share? Have you encountered similar things with your family, and were they eventually able to understand?

Also, I don't want to make it seem like I'm not grateful for her support and care, because I am. But she also played a role in the worst trauma of my life, so I only have so much empathy, and that's also a huge part of the reason I need these boundaries."

"I think you could send some of what you wrote in this post, it seems very well phrased. I think I would understand that as a mother or friend. 

Whether you're ready to confront her with her part of the trauma is up to you, that may cause some drama. But stating boundaries isn't aggressive or confronting. If her effort is really about helping you, she'll appreciate it and respect it, she won't feel bad about you telling her what you need. If she keeps insisting on ""helping"" regardless of your needs, it's likely more about *her* need to feel like a good mother, possibly knowing she hasn't always been. That probably sucks, but you're not responsible for saving her from the consequences of her own actions."	Upstairs-Drummer1648	reply	na	na	na	0.9976024031639099	weak	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"Tw: thoughts of suicide 

I need support and advice right now and I really don’t know where else to find it I know I don’t exactly belong in this subreddit I’m just really struggling.
I’m paranoid about someone I know tracing this back to me so I’m going to be vague but I am looking for guidance and advice right now. 

I had a traumatic experience in my childhood that resulted in me getting diagnosed with anxiety but looking back it seems more like PTSD due to the nature of the situation and the effect on me that followed. This just provides context that I have never been diagnosed with PTSD but I am familiar with the effect of a traumatic experience. 

I feel so stupid even considering this event traumatic but I really don’t know what else would explain the way it affected me. Over a year ago an incident occurred between me and someone I considered a platonic soulmate, I had never had such an amazing friend before I met them. I feel like nobody understands the magnitude of the situation and how terribly it has affected me. I was told the most hurtful things I have ever heard, as I was being told these things I was in so much disbelief I thought I was going to throw up. I know how weird and crazy this sounds but as I was being told these things I felt a switch flip in my head, like what I was being told was going to drastically change things. I  became hysterical, I had overwhelming thoughts of suicide. I knew that day would change me, and it did. We are no longer friends anymore but since that day I have fallen down a deep spiral in my eating disorder, I feel sick to my stomach whenever I’m reminded of anything to do with this person: clothes, places, facial features. I spent days shaking with anxiety because I feel like I’ve been hurt so deeply, I hate being out in public because I’m afraid I’ll run into this person. I often feel like I’d rather be dead than deal with the pain of this persons words and anxiety with everything I do. I feel like I will never exist in peace and I don’t know what to do or how to help myself. I feel so stupid that I’ve allowed myself to be affected by this so much, I want nothing more than to move on but I can’t. I don’t know what to do or what this all means, how can I overcome this?"

It is very difficult losing someone you love in your life. It's worse finding out that the relationship was a lie when they say things you could have never imagined they'd say. Loving yourself is key. Letting go of their words is a must. They could mean the world to you.

"These sound a lot like my symptoms of PTSD, especially the triggers and severe anxiety.

Many of us overcome our trauma and can be symptom-free for long periods of time, and live very normal lives. It's different for everyone, and it also depends on how deeply this trauma affects you. 

It sounds like you experienced a serious betrayal from someone you deeply trusted, and that is... hard. Your feelings are valid, and it's important to be gentle with yourself. You're going through a lot, and validating your feelings is important to healing. 

Therapy is going to be super important, if you're not already doing that. The goal is to stabilize yourself and regulate your nervous system again. Some of us need psych meds (I use CBD) to help calm us down, to the point where we can function in our daily lives again. You're going to want to take things one day at a time, and focus on calming yourself physically and mentally. Eventually, you can work through the trauma, but that's best with a trauma-informed therapist.

Every small thing you do to calm your body & mind down, will add up, and you will see progress. Go easy on yourself, take some time to figure out what calms you, and dive in on the self care. Best of luck to you."	Ok-Tell8768	reply	na	na	na	0.9954167604446411	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"Are you able to take anything in the moment to calm yourself down? Whether it's a fast-acting psych med, or a supplement like valerian root, or something like CBD? For me, when things are really bad, I find that helps me to get stabilized to a place where I can actually ground myself and start to get control of the cycle of anxiety.

Also, distract yourself as much as possible. Your only job right now is to stabilize and calm yourself, so stay occupied with things that comfort you, and do all the self care. Cuddle with a pillow, drink some hot tea, watch a funny tv show, whatever normally makes you feel good. 

It's OK to rest right now, as well... it's probably not the best idea to go on vacation, I actually just canceled on a family vacation that was supposed to be today, as well.

"Some backstory to understand, growing up my dad had a drug problem and my mother is mentally ill, my dad is emotionally abusive and has gotten physical and was mean as hell to me at times growing up. I do not recall anything before I was 7. At all. I was raped for the first time at 11. 
My parents kicked me out of the house at 15, and I went on to become a heroin addict who experienced a lot of sexual assault. I'm sober for a few years now. 
 I did EMDR therapy for my traumas. I relived painful memories of moments I remembered, but not really. 
Anyways, I stopped doing EMDR a year ago. I have been having odd, vivid, picture memories in my mind of my father sexually abusing me in a bathtub. 
This hurts me, and confuses me greatly. I had never felt that before. I was very young in my memories(?), 3-5 maybe... 
i didn't believe this and thought it was my trauma manifesting in some sick flashback, idk. 
But then i recalled my dad, under the influence, crying to me about not being the best dad. And he said something to me that grossed me out at the time, he said ""I mean, I never sexually abused you or anything"" while crying. I remember comforting him that he wasn't a ""bad dad."" 
That was a few years ago. for context I'm 26. 
I don't talk to him really since that ""memory"" surfaced, because I'm unsure if it's true or not."	SnooSketches8545	post	22.108883544938312	female	White	0.5707786679267883	na	na	na	7	ptsd	no prediction.

"I think, what is important is your mental well being. It can be very difficult when you aren't sure, I get that.

However, since there is no way to be certain I suggest that as these memories return to you, you write them down like a story, you may have to update it because timelines can be tricky. 

You then can return and read it as needed to help you process and understand. When you are ready, you can burn it, if you feel like that would help.

This is the advice I have for you, I am sorry that it doesn't give you the peace of the answer you are looking for but I hope it helps you find peace, in time."	SnooSketches8545	reply	na	na	na	0.5707786679267883	weak	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"I’m so sorry for the horrible things that happened to you.  
This might now be a false memory. 
My experienced the same thing. 

My mom started having these memories of her and my aunt at three and two years old respectively being physically, emotionally, and sexually abused at this house. My mom was separated from my aunt and told that my aunt hated her and my grandma hated them both. My mom was put in a garage and her baby blanket was burned in front of her. This torture lasted for 3 days.

My mom finally asked my grandma about it and my grandma told her that it was all true.  My grandma and her boyfriend were going on a trip and my grandma thought it was a good idea to leave my mom and aunt with her ex bf. He was still angry at her for leaving him. He was friends with my grandma’s current boyfriend’s ex girlfriend.

So two angry exes. They brought my mom and aunt to the ex girlfriend’s mother’s house. Then my mother was separated from my aunt. The mother would say horrible things to my mom and hit her. The abuse was horrible.

After my grandma and her boyfriend got back from their trip my grandma went to pick up my mom and aunt from her ex boyfriend’s house but they weren’t there.

He said he wouldn’t give my grandma her children back unless they gave them 500$. This was in 1963. My grandma wanted to call the police but her boyfriend just paid them and got my mom and aunt back. They were dirty and hungry and traumatized so badly my mom blocked it out I guess until she was in her twenties when she started remembering. I think you were abused and you should talk to someone about it. I’m so sorry for what you went through."	SnooSketches8545	reply	na	na	na	0.5707786679267883	strong	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"Hey everyone! For background, I was in an abusive relationship in 2021. I was sold to his friends, cut, and raped quite often. I developed c-ptsd because of this. In 2022, I entered a new relationship and my partner at this time was also sexually abusive, due to what my therapist says is me almost seeking out bad people because abuse is something i am used to. I got out of that as well after only a month.


I am in a relationship now. I will call my boyfriend Mike. Mike is the most loving and understanding person I have ever met. I have had to make my past clear to him, and he is completely understanding as to why I do not have sex. I have been extremely concerned of him leaving due to the fact I refuse sex. He has given me no reason to believe this, but it has been really bothering me. I like to think im as healed as I can be after a year of not being sexually abused, but dating someone has really changed my mind in that. I dont feel like I will ever fit someones needs due to me being this way.

I keep talking to Mike about my fears of not fulfilling him, and he reassures me that sex is not a priority, but no amount of reassurance is helping me, I feel like a worthless partner and i dont know how to stop feeling this way.."	lindorchocolatez	post	13.292928666151832	female	White	0.0019101558718830347	na	na	na	4	ptsd	no prediction.

"Recently it got somewhat better, less brain fog, or a better capability of knowing where my behavior comes  from. I feel closer to my partner. But everything comes with a prize and mine is more and worse flashbacks, caused by the therapeutic process.

This thing is annoying, I had a flashback/intrusion this late morning, with intrusive pictures, high tension in the body and also a twitching arm, and now  I recognize how draining PTSD is. 

I had a lot of nice things in mind which I could do today but right now, I feel how my I got a small fatigue attack, I just could fall asleep immediately.  Arrrghh and you know what coffee just makes it worse because this kind  fatique is  caused by overloaded system shutting down and  forcing it to boot, gives me anxiety, probably because my system needs this kind of soft charge and reboot process.

definitely. i get intense flashbacks and anxiety attacks when my parents have to be near each other or even talk to each other. they are both college professors in the same department. during covid, i would always feel violently sick when they had to be on a zoom call together for work because their divorce was so awful, and the custody arguments were so bad that it was the root of my PTSD. most of my symptoms are nausea and panic attacks or anxiety attacks. i also have a diagnosis of high OCD which for me is mostly obsessions. i overthink everything, everything hurts me when i think about it too. therapy has done wonders for me, escape methods. i am almost at the stage where i can move out and not deal with the constant anxiety of them speaking about custody.

"Why do I get anxiety about having sex?

Even though I've been with the same partner for a very long time, I've had panic attacks leading up to sex or during sometimes. I think it has to do with relaxing and letting go. I often have intrusive thoughts or panic attacks when I'm too relaxed. I think it's about not believing that thinks could be okay, expecting something horrible to happen, times 10000. However, its possible that your issue lies somewhere else, depending on where your trauma lies. So you might have some kind of specific trigger but that's hard to figure out like this. Or its possible it has to do with your heart rate rising due to arousal and it just coinciding with feeling aroused/thinking about sex. Basically you could get anxiety through your heart rate rising and then it rises even more because anxiety and you might start associating anxiety with sex and bam, spiral.	seattleseahawks2014	reply	na	na	na	0.9987548589706421	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"I can share my story of what I've been going through with anxiety and hopefully it can help.

I'm coming out of an abusive relationship with a narcissist (40F). Over the years I found that I dissociated frequently during sex. It would take me a very long time to finish usually, even though to her my finishing quickly was a sign to her that she was desirable. I was diagnosed with CPTSD last month and so I learned that trust is fundamental for intimacy. I am a very attentive lover, but she was in control of both our bodies.

We've been married for 15 years. I repeatedly forgave her bad behaviour and apologised for the smallest inconsequential things over many years. I lost my sense of self the more I sacrificed to make her happy. I became suicidal a couple of years ago, and I was diagnosed with PTSD from my job as a first responder.  I've also had many traumas over my life from CSA, DV, assaults, etc. I left my home so that I wouldn't end my life in a way that would traumatize my friends and family. I came back after being emotionally coerced.

I was diagnosed with ADHD this year as well and following stimulant medication, I tried leaving her earlier this year after she pushed me away when my dad was dying. She manipulated me into coming back to her. When that happened I had a huge anxiety attack and then found that I was dissociating at work. I left my very high paying job, so I was with her all the time basically doing all the housework and child tasks while she studied psychology online, went out with friends and then came back for more sex when she wanted. I dissociated every day for 2 months. I tried my best to please her, but my efforts were rewarded with shame and the occasional crumb of praise. She didn't do a thing to help me get well and was more concerned with our relationship, which meant me changing more to suit her needs. I directed a lot of anger towards myself for being so weak. I could only get motivated when I would berate myself. I could only feel numb or anxious and when needed self directed anger.

She said she wanted a separation after I told her I was checking into a mental hospital because I was running out of energy. 10 days after admission she handed me a letter saying she thought it was best to divorce. She did that the day she first came to bring the kids to visit me at the hospital. The next day I spent a number of hours wandering the streets completely out of grip with reality. I cried tears but I felt no emotion. 

I realised yesterday for the first time that I was trauma bonded with her. Quite by accident, I pushed past the wall of dissociation which had been plaguing me and I found a lot of unresolved anger towards her on the other side. 

So what I speculate is that the anxiety was a block that was causing me to dissociate before I connected with the anger. My mind was actually protecting her from my anger all along, because from a young age I learned to protect my abusers. If I didn't love them I feared I would hurt them. I was anxious of the anger boiling over towards my wife, who had me convinced that she loved me, so I put a lid on it for years with medicine, therapy, alcohol, nicotine, and becoming a workaholic at home and in my career.

Now having seen what I've been holding I have to reprocess my anger, feel it and forgive myself, so that I can continue to be an awesome dad to my wonderful kids. I can find love and compassion for myself. I'm proud of the excellent work and effort I've been able to put in my life. I'm smart, kind and loving, and I'm a protector at my core. I channelled my anger appropriately to protect my community, and my anxiety protected my loved ones from that rage.

While she would never admit it, she used sex to manipulate me because of how anxious she made me.

I still have a while to go before I'm out of the hospital. There are people here on a similar journey who give me genuine love and concern despite our differences. Healing from this will take a long time, but I am hopeful of loving another woman unconditionally who loves me the same way. I have a chance now.

"Relatable. Whenever getting into it, I start to get bombarded with negative thoughts & images, get totally overwhelmed, get violently pulled from the present moment, feel physically immobilized, the anxiety starts to become more suffocating, I start to dissociate and my brain shuts down  and that's the end of that.

"What I’m about to say may offend some people, however please try to take what I say with a grain of salt as I am not a doctor.

I don’t think this has anything to do with ptsd. When it comes to sex, both sides have to normally worry about pregnancy and both sides also have to worry about stds. Now normal from what I’ve heard, most people have anxiety about this if it’s their first time because they want to make sure they’re doing the right thing or they want to make sure they know what they’re doing given the fact that sex requires experience for it to normally be perceived as pleasurable.

If you’re a people pleaser, there’s a good chance that you’re probably just anxious that you just get anxious about sex because you want to make sure that you do a good job. 

I know that what I say correlates primarily with sex between a man and a woman and I am all for LGBT+ activities and etc. but due to the fact of me being straight, I don’t feel it is my place to discuss my thoughts out that area. Let’s just that that all of that stuff about the worrying of stds and etc. apart from pregnancies is pretty much the extent of my knowledge there and I would rather not speculate on what I don’t know."	seattleseahawks2014	reply	na	na	na	0.9987548589706421	no	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
I recently had a near death experience that I believe has given me ptsd, and I noticed that it has really affected my desire and level of arousal. I previously was a higher sex drive woman, but now I have strange feelings around intimacy, almost to the point of it being unappealing. I have found a lot of literature online about the fight or flight response in the nervous system when ptsd is a present--essentially the body goes into constant threat scanning mode, and sometimes the activation energy of getting aroused by something sexual is too much to handle and can cause a panicky feeling. Intimacy involves vulnerability, so for those of us that have been traumatized by something, the hypervigilance that can feel a part of daily life with trauma can make it hard to relax enough to enjoy or derive pleasure from that. I am working with a therapist on my nervous system, and breathing exercises, yoga, and acupuncture have helped me feel more safe in my body to where I can laugh sometimes and feel more like how i used to feel before, more natural and in the moment	seattleseahawks2014	reply	na	na	na	0.9987548589706421	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"I actually had this too. I’m still not sure why but I have a guess.

Having sex makes our dopamine levels rise very strongly. But as my psychiatrist explained to me, dopamine and anxiety are tied together.

I personally noticed all of my senses sharpening a lot after sex. And also my emotions all being much bigger. Like their volume was turned up a lot.

This caused me to feel my anxieties a lot more strongly.

I’m still not sure how does it work exactly, but sometimes having sex was actually very beneficial for my mental balance. Like helping to put my mind on a positive mode. I did take the rest of the day to rest while watching relaxing things tho.

I won’t suggest for people to do things that would make them feel bad. But, for a while I avoided sex because of this. And actually, when I had some in a lighter way that suited me better, after a few sessions my blockage got lifted and it caused me a lot less anxiety. I also felt better in general and I feel that it was something I wish I knew. Maybe it’s something to bring up to therapists.

Yea, it's a mix of things kind of including that too. Idk if I even want to have kids either. I don't want to become abusive. It's other factors as well too, a lot of factors.

It might not have anything to do with sex itself then, which might make it easier to work through it. If you have a partner, I'd recommend being honest and open with them about it. I've had panic attacks during making out and then requested continuing at a slow-pace instead of stopping alltogether, to keep myself from continuing a cycle of fear about it. For the most part, it helped and sex didn't become a trigger of its own through this precaution. Not quite sure about how to deal with it if you're single. Probably a lot harder to deal with with potential hook ups...	seattleseahawks2014	reply	na	na	na	0.9987548589706421	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

What made you post this in r/PTSD? That seems to point to some understanding/awareness that it's connected to things that have happened to you.

"An almost sexual assault experience can be very traumatizing. As well as simply being pressured or coerced into sex or sexual acts. Spankings (imo) cause trauma but a different trauma that makes it easy to be harder on oneself than necessary due to physical punishment from mistakes as a child.

The man who made me uncomfortable I recall him touching my leg on car rides (from age 6 to 11 til I told my parents he made me uncomfortable and no longer was allowed around him without my parents present) and also him favoring me over his own kids who were my age but nothing explicitly sexual yet when I see just pics of him my body immediately enters into fight, flight, freeze mode and I panic. I believe he was grooming me to eventually harm me, which grooming is also sexual trauma."	seattleseahawks2014	reply	na	na	na	0.9987548589706421	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"Yes, I meant traditional in that way, but I guess it's not the issue here. I didn't understand completely your previous comment where you said no assault took place.   An ""almost"" and harassment are very traumatic experiences to link to sex. Are you talking about this with a therapist?

If you don’t want someone on top, you could (and in my opinion *should*) mention it to your potential sexual partner. There are several positions with either sex on top. While you might (and probably will) be clumsy if it’s your first time doing them, a caring partner will understand and rather you be comfortable/feel safe.	seattleseahawks2014	reply	na	na	na	0.9987548589706421	no	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
Yea, I guess. I didn't think about it like that. It was just some question that popped into my head one night. I honestly forgot I had been almost assaulted when I asked and I didn't even recall the incident until the last few months. Back then I just thought it was some stupid game or something (I was 14 but didn't know what SA was.

I was told that too but I disagree since it didn't feel sexual at all. I've had my ass spanked sexually and it was sexual abuse because I didn't consent but my parents doing it felt more like physical abuse not sexual, since it was not for their sexual satisfaction but for punishment.	seattleseahawks2014	reply	na	na	na	0.9987548589706421	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"Hello,

I grew up in a very dysfunctional home for 25 years it got real bad when I hit the age of 21 or so. I did escape in October by Gods grace mercy and help. However now that I’m out things just feel so odd . Like what did I even experience I have this thing where I day dream a lot so when the abuse went on I would day dream to escape or put on music to escape . But now sometimes I have thoughts like oh it wasn’t that bad or atleast it was physical . But this thing did so much damage on me I’m not without a perm home but I know I’ll have my own place one day . Just tired of the voices and I think it’s trying to stop me from telling my story one day but I say also that a lot of people who been through pain you’re very strong more than you know it even if you’re still battling it you still are strong because you don’t give up on the journey"	Rich_Construction_85	post	28.093215856656474	male	White	0.9963437914848328	na	na	na	2	ptsd	no prediction.
I believe a lot of people who have undergone abuse feel that other people had it worse so therefore the abuse suffered isn’t worth being as affected by, but abuse is abuse and while someone may have it worse doesn’t negate the shit you had to go through. Allow yourself to show self compassion. You are strong and a survivor and will prosper. It’s also very normal to have blocked memories of abuse. It’s our brains way of protecting us. 🫶🏻	Rich_Construction_85	reply	na	na	na	0.9963437914848328	weak	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
Looking for opinions! My spouse & I have been together for almost 10 years! We both have childhood PTSD that not only effects ourselves but the way we think, react or communicate! Someday I feels like I have met the best person to spend my life with then other days I feel like we are completely non compatible! We’ve both been in active therapy for the past 3 months for me(but I have went as a adolescent)& 1 year for her. So we’re both healing through our own individual traumas while correcting the habits/characteristics from the PTSD! It’s like when one of us are having a good day the other is either triggered or healing/feeling thru one of their traumatic moments! So it’s hard to get a full positive day anymore! She tells me all every month for the 3 years she wants a divorce but recently after a session she’s told me she truly loves me & knows she hasn’t been the best person to me but want to be better! I get that because I was not always the person I am today for her! But my thing is I do not know what’s right or wrong anymore! Or true or not!

"Tw for description of bodily unwellness and medically challenging situations            

It’s really hard to even write about it but I don’t know what to do so I’ll write a short text about it…             

When I was 8 my brother nearly died in front of my eyes. It’s a long story but; long story short: we called an ambulance and I hid in the kitchen because I felt like I was in the way and also needed to calm down (I’m autistic so everything was even more intense and horrifying to me).                  
That day he almost suffocated.          
After some hospital time my trauma would be retriggered throughout many years though (my brother has anxiety and a sensitive stomach, so… yeah…)             
Everytime I hear someone throw up or just caugh, my body gets into full alarm mode and I can’t do anything else than shiver, cover my ears, close my eyes and go to foetus-position (this is kind of a reflex, I can’t really control how much it is).                   

Yesterday my bf threw up because he was feeling unwell because of some brownies he ate. He was feeling dizzy and sick and I knew that I couldn’t take care of him that well, so I made some preparations and put a bucket and some water on the floor for him before anything happened.                
As soon as it started I couldn’t move anymore. I was shivering, quietly crying and talking to myself “everything’s gonna be okay” repeatedly. He was trying to tell me calm me but I just shove his hand away and could barely talk but bit after bit almost whispered “I can’t take care of you, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry (idk how much I repeated it but that happens a lot when Im panicking…). Everything’s gonna be okay, everything’s gonna be okay. Please tell me when I should call an ambulance” whilst trembling so hard that I could barely even get the words out.                     
The situation lasted even longer and he was throwing up a few times really heavily.           
I was staying with him but in foetus-panic mode all the time.             
When he fell asleep I was awake the whole night and watched after him.             

Since then I’ve got panic attacks almost all day long… as long as I don’t distract myself, some memory will sneak into my mind and make my breath faster, my muscles tense etc. until I end up in foetus-panic-mode again.                 

I don’t know what to do.           
I’ve had triggers in the past but they were not that bad and I just don’t know how to handle it."	l0rare	post	15.594421741114054	female	White	0.9926059246063232	na	na	na	1	ptsd	no prediction.

"That's all really.

The abuse happened when I was between 5 and 8 so I can't actually remember his face when I'm awake but it was so vivid in the dream.

He came into my childhood home and was staying there, sleeping in my room. It seemed like no one else knew he was a horrible shitstain of a person. Much like real life I didn't tell anyone. But contrary to real life I made him very uncomfortable with passive aggressive remarks and hints that he was abusive. I made it clear that he wasn't welcome in my space. I even threw things at him. I beaned him right in the face with a small grinder. 

I'm not sure what it all means. I'm not distressed or triggered now that I'm awake. I can't remember his face again. I guess I have something to talk about in therapy this week."	EeveeStark13	post	25.792331405546502	female	White	0.9696985483169556	na	na	na	1	ptsd	no prediction.

"Molested when I was 8 by my cousin, severely bullied when I was in high school (shot at by a BB gun) and sexually assaulted when I was at university. I’ve had a very rough time growing up. I want to make sure I come out on top of this but by god it’s difficult. As inspiring as quotes such as “do not pray for an easy life, pray for the strength to endure a difficult one” sometimes the weight is too much to bear. I’m only human, there’s only so much pain one person can endure. Life everyone knows is full of ups and downs but the downs feels like the absolute rock bottom and the ups just doesn’t feel as it goes that high in comparison. 

I don’t think I’ll ever be able to form intimate relationships with other people again, nevermind romantic relationships. It’s never right to play the victim card as I know it’s never constructive but hell with the absolute shit show of a life I have had I deserve to play victim sometimes.

i remember being sexually assaulted by my father (first person to do that but not the last) at a pretty young age, so most of it is hazy with only two or three events clearly coming to mind. that was until today. i was already on edge from 2 sleepless nights back to back that i spent crying for whatever reason, and a few weeks of not eating well because of low appetite. i couldnt take a shower for around the past week, i dont have a home rn. and even when i got the opportunity for a shower i thought i was too depressed for it so i passed it up. today, i thought a warm shower would be nice to unwind after hours of crying almost none stop. i usually figure out how to calm myself down within 20 minutes max, but for some reason it dragged on for hours today. i got undressed to go into the shower and realised i couldnt look at my own naked body without disgust, from this point on its mostly a blur. i started off with burning hot water and started almost scrubbing my skin off instead of washing it. in the middle of rinsing out the skin that i had irritated the water went out. i was already on edge and probably already panicking really badly from the moment i undressed. i moved to get out of the shower and wait for hot water, but then for some reason some part of me that hated myself and my body said fuck it and i decided to dump buckets of cold water down my head all over my body saying shit along the lines of slut shaming to myself. i dug my nails into my shoulders for comfort because that was the only part of me that ddnt feel “dirty” in that moment. i dont fucking know what i remembered, but my subconscious sure did. i kept telling myself i deserved this much and that i was disgusting. the freezing cold water only amplified my panic and before i knew it i was having a panic attack. i havent had one in so long and they were never this bad. i literally couldnt even hold the soap without dropping it from how bad i was shaking and crying. i eventually found myself with my hands together and praying, i dont remember what i prayed for. im not religious now but i was raised very religiously. i dont question what i did mainly because it was some sort of fight or flight thing and instincts that i couldnt stop. i manhandled myself rest of the “shower” which seemed to be more of an excuse to torture myself by now. i got out of the shower and instantly went to cover myself up so i didt see my body in the mirror but then that self hating piece of shit in me told me to see what i was. so i waddled around the bathroom not knowing what to do with myself. i eventually settled on “brushing”my hair which meant pulling clumps of hair off my head and calling myself a whore while crying and shaking even more eventually hitting myself on the head with the back side of the hairbrush. i didnt brush my teeth, i didnt condition my hair, i didnt style my hair after. all these routines that i had adopted over time to be more gentle with myself were suddenly out of the window. i dont even know what memory caused this because there are so fucking many of them and so amny sick bastards and i was a child. so what the fuck do i do with myself, ive seen myself scared, depressed and suicidal but ive mever seen myself like this. i want to let myself sleep but im scared of the nightmares starting again. help me please anyone. it was supposed to get better by now."

"TW: car accidents, medical trauma, caretaker trauma, emotional anguish, depression , graphic descriptions, suicidal ideation, parentification 


Going through a flashback. My mom was was hit by a pickup when I was 12. I became her parentified caretaker for years while she was wheelchair bound.  Today at 22 she wants me to accompany her on a one hour drive to help a friend who had the same accident. I'm having flashbacks and I need to flush them out of my system. 



The stench of a week-old cast sock I have to remove. It smelled like rotten flesh. The sound of crutches at 7AM behind my door. The maggots in the breen bin. The forced smiles. The hunger. Her skin under my hands as I'm washing her. Being woken up at 4AM so I can carry her to the bathroom. The smell of 2 week old cat litter. Scrubbing dishes at 10PM. Cooking and serving her food, her polite face trying to be nice about my cooking. Spending an hour hanging laundry. Being yelled at for putting work pants in the dryer. Feeling trapped. Wanting to die but wondering who would bathe and feed my mom then. Her mood swings. The sound of the wheelchair haunting the halls. My name being called. Why? Painkiller. Water. A snack. More pepper on the sandwhich. Not enough ice in the drink. Help shifting position on the couch. Help going to the bathroom. Fetch a book. Fetch her pen. The blanket fell off her toes. I didn't get the right plate. She's frustrated. I feel guilty. My feet hurt and I want to die and she's yelling but it's not her, it's the PTSD again, shouting in my mother's voice and speaking through her like an angry spirit. The sound of her crawling up the stairs in her cast. The sound of the shower, relief, sweet relief that I have 8 minutes of peace before I need to dress her. I'm 12. The sound of the fireworks I'm missing from my window, while my brother is at the local fair, because someone needed to stay behind snd take care of her. I climb on my window sill, breathless, hoping to catch a glimpse, crying of despair. I hear fireworks and laughter and rollercoasters..... And a tree is hiding the view."	throwawayyys89098	post	29.91231610952103	female	White	0.883386492729187	na	na	na	1	ptsd	no prediction.

I was severely bullied as a kid for years. I’m 38 now and my condition is the worst it’s ever been. I’m angry all the time. I’m also depressed.  I can’t walk down the street without being triggered by a simple look from a stranger. My biggest fear/trigger is when walking down a sidewalk and someone doesn’t make space for me to pass (you know those  ppl that don’t move out of the way). I feel so disrespected. Is this ego? I get so consumed by this small events. I’m reaching a point where I don’t want to go out in public anymore. I’ve tried EMDR and talk therapy, it didn’t help. I’m thinking about getting on SSRI’s.

"So I'll admit I'm new to this page, so don't get too worked if I'm posting something that has been beaten to death.

I have dealt with rare instances of emotion over the last few years (usually when drunk), about my deployments(a decade past). But, over the last year or so, some terrible memories have been creeping into my dreams and everyday conversation. This typically either jolts me awake with an adrenaline drop while I'm sleeping (which sucks more than most people know) or causes a visible change  in posture, expression, and overall tone.

I'm not sure how to deal with this, but it's getting worse. Unfortunately I've been getting hammered so I can sleep, but I know this is absolutely the wrong thing to do...

I just made a post on how the VA treated me and how the command reacted earlier today. Maybe it will help you in your journey through the system.

my trauma stems from witnessing abuse, including sexual abuse,  but being unable to do anything about it; now it's been 8 years, I'm getting therapy, I'm in a positive stable relationship, & overall I'm doing so much better, but one of my many reoccurring issues is feeling as though I'm being abusive & I get heavily self destructive as I feel like I need to punish myself, does anyone else experience this? & sometimes, when I DON'T feel as though I'm being abuse I find myself being in the mood but depriving myself of it when my partner tries to initiate it?  it's obviously some self destruction, but I'm curious if other people experience it too?	wallsrbreathing	post	15.356474643133534	male	White	0.0047589861787855625	na	na	na	1	ptsd	no prediction.

Is there anyone out there that feels invalid because their abuse was unconventional? 

I (F) was molested as a child by my older sister and I feel like no one else was. Every time I read an online support group there are never any female victims with female abusers (but there are plenty F-M, M-M). It makes me feel like my abuse was just harmless experimentation. Although I know that isn’t true, my abuse started at around 2 when she was around 7, and ended when I was around 11 and she was around 16 (when she got her first gf), it feels like no one else relates. 

Is there any way to deal with this kind of invalidation? Are there any support groups that center female victims with female abusers? If you are a female victim with a female abuser, how do you deal with the underrepresentation?"

I developed Grave’s disease (autoimmune thyroid disease) in my late teens. All the doctors told me I couldn’t have anything wrong with my thyroid because it was an “old person disease”.

"My mom grew up in physically abusive poverty and married an emotionally manipulative CFO in the 80s. When I was a teen, she battled hyperthyroidism and unusual liver enzyme levels. She was always stressed out, took no days off, and still wears a little glass seed-beed bracelet of random colors I made for her the only time she was so sick, she was on the bathroom floor. She drank a lot of chardonnay over the years by having between 2-3 glasses each night, but never finishing the bottle as her source of I'm-not-actually-a-disturbed-addict-pride. That time she was sick, she had the flu for multiple days, and my dad went to work, and I took care of her.

I listen to my anxiety so I can hopefully avoid auto-immune problems like my mom had.

My mom's mom was verbally and physically abusive, and my mom's dad cheated with the neighbor lady.

On top of that, I also have insomnia and constant fatigue. And I’ve had multiple weird cystic issues, which seem to flare up when I am extra stressed.

Yes. Trauma is directly linked to chronic illnesses like Fibromyalgia which I developed during my first relationship at 14-15 which was extremely abusive and was stalked and tormented by him when I tried to leave, 2 sexual assault right after that relationship with 3 guys (one was 23 and I was 15), losing my father at 19 and not dealing with any of this or telling anyone for 13 years. Trapped unresolved pent up trauma lead me to being fully disabled from my Fibro which spread to every inch of my body and got worse and worse. Developed IBS, TMJ, insomnia and other disorders along with it, all triggered by stress (and stress triggers Fibro flare ups the worst). I turned to drugs and other ways to cope before I was diagnosed and researched the link to trauma. I wish I knew earlier, and possibly could've prevented all of this had I gone to trauma counseling. But I was not ready for a long time and I was unaware that it was causing me to be physically ill. I read that it can be the same with autoimmune diseases.

Me too 💔 all of this except the last condition you listed.

I didn't know what chronic illness even was until 2021). This is why it's so important to spread awareness and education on it. That's why I do it.

"To use a crude analogy that many medical researchers use, DNA is a gun. Your environment and more importantly, how you process your environment, is what triggers genetic information or not.  You can get breast cancer without the braca gene and you can have the braca gene and never get breast cancer.   Meditation greatly aides you in how you process your environment.  And there's no bad side effects.

To be blunt, this is readily available information and has been proven.  It takes 10-20 years for new research to get into medical textbooks which is why a lot of old theories and research are still circulating.  Meditation and exercise has been proven time and time again to be as effective if not more effective than psychiatric meds for the overwhelming majority of the population.

"Yes, being exhausted with 24/7 fatigue makes living life harder. Add in chronic late-stage Lyme disease co-infections that are now in my brain and you get a not-well person suffering from the pains of trauma and under-treated Lyme diseases. Unresolved traumas and stress that can't be resolved are stuck in my brain. Wake me up all night long in replays. Haven't slept well in years is exhausting. Then there are the medical traumas when you can't find adequate medical interventions and nobody cares if you are well or sick. Untrustworthy doctors and nurses who add new traumas and commit criminal acts freely without consequences caused more trauma. Criminally attacked and my childhood Pandora's box opened making my life a living hell now over three years and still fighting for my life mostly alone. What are rights when unenforceable? Nothing! If you have been labeled with a mental illness you are automatically discriminated against, stripped of any rights, condemned, harmed in the process of refusing what is supposed to have been help but caused more harm than they care to know. Medicare fraud and nobody cares about that either. The hospital billed $10,000 to harm a patient is Medicare fraud that DHHS ignores when reported. I was treated less than a felony criminal due to no enforceable patient rights or constitutional or humane rights based on hearsay and no facts of any sort. Attempted entrapment that the RN failed to achieve to Blue Paper me. Also, nobody cares even though it is of record and an obviously failed setup to justify the illegal acts committed but did not. Held prisoner 24 hours then cut loose harmed worse off than ever! Traumatized and harmed more and left dismayed so much I can't go to the doctor anymore. Harmed and was told that CPTSD is the issue they claim they ""are not trained to recognize"". Seriously! Absolute medical malpractice and negligent to have allowed to have occurred. I have to believe there is more than this life here on Earth. A higher purpose as to why we are tested so cruelly here. Holding on to strings of hope that keep fraying on me. I am working to heal my CPTSD trauma reactions that feel at times like they are killing me. An invisible prison! Deep despair is the enemy I fight daily that feels so evil. Isolate to try to stay safe and then get lonely and down the rabbit hole I fall. Being tired all the time just adds to the weight I carry. I am 60 years old and continue to struggle in life from childhood and adult traumas and the world chaos we see so much of in today's world adds to this despair. My husband is living in a nursing home dying from advanced MS. So, grief adds to my pain as well. I feel the pains we all suffer with.  Often, I feel so alone in this mental struggle my life is, and reading other people's posts helps to know we are not alone. I hope this helps you to feel you are not so alone in your struggles. Take care! Get outside! Exercise and eating well helps. To this day, I actively am seeking healing and wellness. A life-long journey. May we all achieve healing.

I sent her an apology text and she hasn’t called me since but said she accepted my apology. 

Now…I really just don’t wanna talk to her with her sending the “in my prayers” texts. Everything with her is about god it consumes her every thought. I’m just so insanely tired of it.

TW for csa 

I was wondering what symptoms other people noticed for CSA in kids. By brain is driving me mad and maybe needs some validation please. 

So apparently my brain wants to focus on a few vague memories at the moment despite also having clearer memories aswell. 

Now i'm not really sure what age i was in this memory but i think it was before 10 yr old maybe 8/9ish but not sure. So i remember a presence above me, feeling trapped and then waking up and my pjs had been turned around. I also remember seeing a male family friend that night in the hallway with my door open and who had stayed that night i think. I feel gross about the memory.  Him and his gf stayed a few times, used to walk in and out of our house whenever. My mum/dad and them would at times expriment with each other sexually (my mum told me this information when i was a tween).

I had always linked my hypersexuality to the event when i was 10 but my dissociation started around 8 so could have been linked to this younger age. 

I mean this male friend of the family did  go further when i was older and involve his stepdaughter and me in an full assault when i was 10. 

Sometimes im like am i making all these vague and vivid things up ya know i mean this feeling a presence etc can happen with sleep paralysis right? But at the same time i did start dissociating around that age, well 8ish i remember doing it. I've always struggled with sleep i.e. night terrors/sleep paralysis/ nightmares/dreams of being assaulted etc.im not sure if this is all linked at all tbh it just feels gross. 

I know people can't confirm things for me but i think i just need some validation i think."	exploding_pingu	post	31.17412214289934	female	White	0.9939524531364441	na	na	na	3	ptsd	no prediction.

"So, not only did I not ask to be born, but I also didn’t ask to exist as a human with a mega-discount-bundle of mental disorders, such as: OCD, Anorexia Nervosa, with a tasteful dash of C-PTSD. Rest assured, I’ve had a fun and incredibly memorable life (ahaha please take me out of my misery).

I’ve been in a prolonged depressive episode for a couple of years now, it really started in 2021, but got ten times worse in the fall of last year. Ever since then, I’ve been on an even steeper downhill path. I feel like my life resembles a fucking bowling ball that never hits any of the pins, just pathetically rolls sideways. Every day. 

I don’t have many people in my life, but the few that I talk to and confess my troubles to, always say stuff like: oh well, you should try being more present; have you tried mindfullness; and of course, have you tried therapy?

Now, the answer is yes to all of the above. But like, how the fuck do you explain to people that, with the amount of trauma I’ve endured, I can’t do fuck all. I can’t do basic human tasks without dissociating and getting flouded by flashbacks. Everything reminds me of my past, and being in the moment is excruciatingly difficult, when the past sucks you in like quicksand any time you try to forget it.

I haven’t had that extreme of a problem as your description from my mental illnesses, but I can kind of understand that from my last month of health issues. I’m constantly feeling horrible, no medication is dulling my symptoms, and I can’t even function normally anymore. Even putting clothes on is hard. At the same time, I look normal from the outside and people are doubting anything is wrong with me. They’re all “get enough sleep” and “just ignore that feeling” or “try taking a walk.” Meanwhile, it’s hard for me to walk across my home or even go 10 minutes without thinking about how uncomfortable I am or the pain I’m in. It’s enough to make me want to start screaming at everyone since they seem to think it’s so easy to just feel normal and be totally healthy.	blablA4749	reply	na	na	na	0.9979497790336609	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"(tw: CSA, suicidal stuff) I don't know. I won't act on it, but I feel  absolutely certain that I deserve to die. It feels like I've been contaminated for my whole life and getting away with it because I look like a real person externally. Like I have a human suit on. But it also feels like I'm not alive, real, or ""deserving"" of anything I guess? I feel like a tiny scorched demon leaking oil everywhere, waiting for someone to finally just step on me and snap my neck. And I'm sick of it. I feel like I'm tricking people into thinking I'm human and I don't want to.

And like I know I'm not that unique or that big of a deal. Like I'm not a literal fucking demon. Lots of people have been through the exact same shit as me and worse and it's never their fault. But idk. It really feels like it's different and my fault, it happened because of who I am, and I deserved so much worse. Which makes no logical sense and sounds like some PTSD shit but that doesn't seem to matter to my brain.

I feel completely responsible, like it doesn't even count as abuse and I'm the one who did it. I had sex with an adult over and over and over. I did the actions. I feel like I don't get what is wrong with me. I think I only have one memory from before it started maybe. It seems intertwined with who I am as a person. It feels like what I did was fucked up and I don't understand how to separate that from me being inherently fucked up.

When I talk about it I'm worried people will think I'm a pedophile because I have so many thoughts about having sex as a kid. I feel like a horrible person who has done too many disgusting things to be salvagable. None of this ""makes sense"" but that doesn't stop me from feeling it strongly. I feel like people keep wanting me to acknowledge/accept that it wasn't my fault because that makes logical sense, but that feels so deeply wrong that I can't do it.

idk I guess I'm triggered and don't know how to get out of this shitty mindset. I feel like I don't understand who keeps looking through my eyes and controlling my hands.

"I relate to you a lot. I was 12 when I ""dated"" a 17 year old for a couple of months. Never said no to them, but I never said yes either.
It took me multiple years to see what happened, I didn't see how fucked up it was until I reached my assaulter's age.
I know it wasn't right, I know it wasn't my fault.
But to this day I still blame myself. I feel like a fraud and an evil person and like I've been lying to myself and everyone else this whole time because surely it wasn't ""real"" assault and it ""wasn't that bad"" and I just want attention and pity so I try to make myself a victim.

Self-blame and hatred are very common responses to trauma. What helps me is looking at my childhood photos. I can say all the awful shit I want, but I have to look my child self in the eyes when I do so. Makes it a lot easier. I also often imagine it's someone else I'm talking to, that these things happened to someone else and I'm just consoling them. Helps to put things into perspective.

Many people don't ever realize or accept that they were assaulted, because our brains are trying so hard to protect us from that knowledge.
It's easier to belittle your pain than to admit you were violated.

Doesn't matter what you did, no adult should do things to or ""with"" a child even if that child begged for them to. 
Even if you were the actual Devil reincarnated, you wouldn't deserve what happened to you.
It wasn't your fault even if you didn't understand it was wrong at the time. It wasn't on you to stop it from happening.
None of it was and none of it ever will be your fault. The adult knew better, they knew what they were doing. They knowingly harmed you.

"I get you. I don't feel that way anymore, but I did in the past.

Sometimes it's helped me to separate myself from the kid who went through everything. I look at that kid, and I can feel compassion for him. I can feel sad for him.

I know that he was doing the best he could with what he had to work with at the time.

So was the kid on your end.

Adults were responsible for protecting you, not the other way around. 

Kids try to touch hot stoves, run across the street without looking, all sorts of shit that they just don't know better than to do yet.

It's not okay for adults to let them get hurt just because they think they want to do those things.

I used to get a lot out of tactile comfort, if that would work for you too. Hot showers. Curling up in blankets. Feeling covered and safe. The more I treated my body soothingly and gently, the easier it was to have sympathy for it.

Sometimes it also helped to get angry at the person who was really responsible. To hate them, not myself. To blame them.

And sometimes it also helped to just...do good things for other people. To be able to sit down and be like ""I made things better today"". To know that I made a difference, and the world was better with me in it.

It's hard to feel like as much of a piece of shit after that. 

> I'm worried people will think I'm a pedophile because I have so many thoughts about having sex as a kid.

I hope it goes without saying, but no. You're not. At all. Would you ever hurt a child? No, right? The thought of it probably makes you want to throw up? Then no. You're just someone with intrusive thoughts because fixation on past trauma is PTSD's bread and butter.

> I feel like people keep wanting me to acknowledge/accept that it wasn't my fault because that makes logical sense, but that feels so deeply wrong that I can't do it.

Knowing is easier than believing. Yeah.

You're not alone in your brain, in a way. There's a monster in there with you. It feels like your thoughts. It feels like your honest feelings. 

But it's just looking for someone to take the pain out on. There's something powerful about self-hatred. Aggression towards a target you don't have to feel guilty for beating up. Free real estate. 

It keeps the sadness away, too...which is necessary sometimes, but comes with the price of self-destruction.

It’s so fucking hard sometimes because I know how illogical the way I feel is but that doesn’t stop me feeling it.  Survivor’s guilt is a big example of the personally.  There’s like 4 people I feel like their deaths are my fault.  Logically I know I wasn’t even in the same county as all four of them when they died.  I know they made their own choices and my taking responsibility is robbing them of their agency.  But it doesn’t stop me feeling like their deaths are my fault.

"TW: mentions of abuse, miscarriage

I was severely abused and my (and my then unborn baby's) life threatened while pregnant by my Fiancè's family (his sisters, and his daughter whom got coerced by his sisters/her aunties and cousins!).

I felt completely helpless, powerless, vulnerable, in constant fear etc and ended up quite severely traumatised by the entire ordeal and my PTSD (was already diagnosed from years of DV abuse) flared up real bad!

My Fiancè is a victim himself, but regardless he did not support me well at all throughout the entire ordeal, throughout my pregnancy, making excuses for his daughter, siding with and enabling her and believing her rubbish lies while she lived in my home and tried to terminate my pregnancy/cause miscarriage etc. I felt unheard, unsupported, invalidated, powerless and the most vulnerable I have ever been in my life!

Now, anything that makes me feel unheard, invalidated, unsupported, vulnerable, helpless or powerless, is a major trigger and I feel rage and/or panic etc.

My Fiancè enjoys making me jealous to boost his ego or something. I told him to stop because even tho he's joking, it has been chipping away at my confidence and self-worth. It has begun giving me anxiety. He said he would.

Then last night he asked about my brothers Fiancèe, and I straight away thought he was trying to make me jealous again and I just lost it. I got so angry I basically told him to get fkd, grabbed our baby and went to feed him, leaving my dinner unfinished because I lost my appetite.

He handled it poorly, getting defensive and angry because I was angry, and repeatedly stating that he was genuinely curious about her ethnic background (same as his) because of our kids. (I/we have NC with my brother and his SO or their kids btw). He was quite aggressive about it, instead of comforting me etc which maybe I seemed unapproachable but I felt very hurt and triggered and tried to explain how hurt i felt after i went to the trouble of cooking us an awesome meal, for him start asking about another woman.

Edit: my perception of him not respecting my wishes about not making me jealous for his amusement made me feel powerless and triggered a way out of proportion reaction from me.

Anyway, after he realised he handled the whole thing really shit. He apologised and explained etc. I said ""ok"" but I was unable to feel happy at the click of a finger, I have a really hard time calming back down and my mood improving after I've gotten really upset. Dunno if this is normal but it takes me a long time to turn my mood around once it takes a tumble.

I accepted his apology but we didn't speak after that, I fell asleep from exhaustion, and he left (we don't live together because of what happened with his daughter).

Is it a PTSD symptom to struggle to come back from being upset. Do people usually quickly bounce back after they've been apologised to etc? I have had PTSD so long that I feel I've always had this problem. I'm sick of it. The night was ruined. I wish I was able to snap out of that mood after being triggered but I just can't!

Has anyone found a way to come back to at least neutral after being triggered? It takes me FOREVER!!!

I will ask my Psychologist when I see her next but that's a little while away and this is really bothering me, because generally my SO has been improving a lot and our relationship has been better and I really don't want us to lose progress because of my shitty mental health and what his monstrous family has done to us!

I don't know for sure about being unable to bounce back emotionally being a ptsd symptom, but I think it is. As well as a c-ptsd symptom (which is what I have). Ive been like this my entire life essentially. It's gotten somewhat better as I've healed a bit, but it happened again recently. I was able to recognize that the argument had actually triggered my cptsd and that's why it took the whole day to calm down.

I have recently realized that noise is a huge trigger for me \[as in, not just sudden noises as I have thought before\] but just constant background noise gives me anxiety. Meeting friends outside of any of out houses is a huge problem when Its supposed to be in a bar or otherwise loud place. I am so sorry you're having such a hard time with it. I feel that moment so much. When you'Re feeling like shit and you know its in your head and you just hate all of it and feel powerless to do anything. It's been 10 hours since you posted this so I'm assuming you're either there or its over now. I hope you managed to go and had some fun anyway. I know it can be the worst but staying in contact with people who care about you is one of the most important parts of dealing with this. Try to allow yourself breaks when you can. If you find anything that eases your pain in any way, no matter what - taking a plushy with you, going outside for a while every 15 minutes, anything... allow yourself to do it. There is no shame in it, there should hopefully be no judgement for it. If you feel that people will understand then try to be open about the issue with your friends. Maybe in the future you can find places to hang out that are more tolerabe for you in some ways. I wish you all the best.

"I’m Autistic and a sensory seeker so - I need a loud bar, preferably a disco with lights and music. I used to go to these places because I could retreat to a dark corner or hang out where the music was loud enough  not to have to talk to people if I felt anxious or upset. It’s the getting ready to go I get anxious and stressed about because a lot of the time I was abused over everything I did wrong like how I dressed or being late etc. Being around booze or drugs with PTSD is a bad idea though and really we all should actively avoid it as it can lead to more problems.

For me it’s quiet places like other peoples homes and living rooms that make me feel uneasy - this is the type of situation where bad things would happen but the loud bar is where I used to be able to escape to arbeit temporarily. Other people around (ie witnesses) made me feel safe (ish) and the only other place was being locked alone in my room. I’d get shit off my pals as they actually hated going out as we were all broke and would get offended that I was weird about sitting in peoples houses.

I’m saying this because there’s no right or wrong way to cope with trauma. Your triggers are your triggers. It’s not your fault. There are things you can do to handle these situations better. If you trust your friends you should be able to tell them this and they should be understanding about it. Your choices should be respected also. As you get older you feel less obliged to be in situations that make you uncomfortable anyway - especially ones that revolve around bars and alcohol. 

It would be the same case if you had a problem being around booze. In fact it’s better for people like us to stay away from places like that as we are more likely to run into trouble for many reasons. One thing Richard Grannon said in his videos was we just have to accept that we can’t interact with the world the same as everyone else. We have to be more careful especially around drugs and booze, around potentially dangerous people and unpredictable situations. Unfortunately we have to take better care of ourselves than most people would consider doing. 

You don’t ever have to do anything you don’t want to. Good people will understand. And if for whatever reason you feel you really do want to be comfortable in those situations again it’s something you can gradually work on over time."

"I feel like I'm having symptoms of ptsd after being cheated on several times by my abusive ex. He was also very emotionally abusive and manipulative and would convince me that I caused it by acting crazy and pushing him away but when I was ready to leave he would act like he loved me again and it turned into an emotional roller coster of a cycle leaving me feeling like my head was spinning in circles. Now I have intrusive memories, ruminations and nightmares of the cheating and even though I finally left him over a year ago I get paranoid about it happening in my new relationship.
Cheating was far from the only abuse my ex put me through but it's the thing that still manifest itself into my life and view of the world. I hope I don't sound dramatic.

You don't sound dramatic! You went through a deeply traumatic experience and you were betrayed repeatedly in various ways by a person who tried to convince you that you could trust them. Being mistreated and lied to by a romantic partner is a special kind of painful and it's completely normal, albeit unfair, that you're having some trouble in the wake of that.

After the abuse you went through, it's perfectly understandable that you would have intrusive thoughts and a variety of other symptoms. You're obviously going to have trust issues in your current relationship. It seems to be fairly common for flashbacks and intrusive thoughts to be about a specific part of the abuse. It sounds to me like the cheating was a symbol of a much bigger problem.	Agile_Squirrel3715	reply	na	na	na	0.011606930755078793	weak	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"I can relate. About 10 years ago I was in a similar abuse, brainwashing relationship where I was cheated on repeatedly—and of course he always made it my fault that he cheated. I’ve had a few relationships since then, but to this day I have some paranoia that my partner will cheat on me.

That experience is also a regular topic in my therapy sessions, though it’s only one of four trauma experiences that contribute to my overall PTSD symptoms, so I can’t confirm which symptoms exactly are caused by that relationship."

For me, flashbacks and intrusive thoughts are often about something that is only somewhat related to the trauma. Like I keep seeing a dirty window that I saw during a rape. The dirty window itself wasn't traumatic. It was the rape that was traumatic. It seems as if something similar is happening to you. The cheating was only part of a very traumatic, abusive situation you were in. It seems as if your brain has focused on that one thing.

You can definitely experience physical side effects from severe trauma. I have another condition called POTS, which involves low blood pressure and a dysregulated nervous system. That seems to be what's behind my issues, personally.

"I'm having a rough time right now, so I'm sorry if I'm not articulating this very well... but part of my trauma involved living in a different country. I was dating & living with people who spoke a different language and had different accents, and my accent naturally changed a bit during that time.

I started speaking more clearly and kind of developed a different accent. It happens a lot with people who teach English as a foreign language, or move abroad for long periods of time, for example. You learn to speak in a way that other people can better understand you.

Now it's been a couple of years since my trauma, and I'm back in my home country. My ""original"" accent has been coming through again. I'm from the Southwest USA, and have sort of a combination of a California accent and a slower, rural country drawl. There was a time when I was homesick, trapped abroad in the pandemic, got very sick and had a near death experience... I just didn't think I'd ever see my family or friends from home, again. I would look for people with my regional accent on youtube, and listen to their voices. I listened to the band ""The Killers"" a lot, because Brandon Flowers sounds like me & people from my hometown.

So anyway... now I'm starting to hear that voice again, coming out of me, and it's hard. It reminds me of that period of longing for home. It's like finding myself again, but also being constantly reminded of everything that changed, and everything I lost. (I basically nearly died, couldn't get married to my partner at the time, had to come home, and left my home abroad -- full of friends, my belongings, my pets -- behind very suddenly, with no knowledge of whether I was going to live. Everything since then feels like a dream, or like I actually did die.)

I can't avoid my own voice as a trigger, obviously. I'm crying a lot from PTSD, probably 2 hours every day. I just don't really know what to do or how to help this improve.

Any tips? I'd really really appreciate it. Sorry if this is hard to relate to or a super specific/unusual question. Thank you for reading!"	Upstairs-Drummer1648	post	20.86716794540324	female	White	0.9833382368087769	na	na	na	2	ptsd	'no prediction.'

I’m struggling with deeeeeep dissociation lately and typical grounding techniques (naming objects around me, feeling carpet or grass on bare feet, reminding myself of my current age and year etc) haven’t been working for a while now. Within the last few months I’ve resorted to scratching at myself (arms/wrists/legs) even enough to draw blood. Now…that doesn’t really work anymore. What else can I do? I can usually tell when I’m about to dissociate (a floating/tingling feeling or a sense of falling out of the back of my head) so I have a little warning before I’ve gone full out numb or lost in a flashback. I asked my therapist and he just told me that normal grounding techniques WILL work 😕 I felt too stupid to argue with him about it.

"Grounding has helped me tremendously although when I was in a perpetual state of disassociation— it was something that I had to be patient about and forgiving towards myself and you have to either be optimistic about it or at least neutral about it

Also, it’s not necessarily the techniques alone but rather the purpose behind the techniques

As an example - logically speaking - naming 5 things in a room is probably something that we subconsciously do when we walk to a room and scan our environment looking for something  even for people that never experienced that state of disassociation 

The difference is the reason / purpose

When you learn effective grounding techniques — in my opinion — with the help of a professional at first — you are learning that it is safe to remain in your body, how to stay firmly planted, hold yourself, shield yourself, and protect yourself, etc…so that you can apply this during very important moments in your life as well 

Once you’ve learned the basic ones then you can identify and create new ones

As an example - I have learned over the years that holding my arms and gently brushing my arm is a way that helps me feel safe and present

There are also a lot of other ones that I found out about online

However, I wouldn’t recommend this unless I had the basic foundation ones that are taught by a professional since those have been implemented in practices for many years"	LittleElfishPresley	reply	na	na	na	0.9971110820770264	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"I hear you.

With the ups-and-downs swings emotionally with my ptsd - I was 'trained' with my therapist to find some tools to mitigate the swings. 

ie. Baseball. (follow me on this) But when emotions fly one needs a 'metronome' - a tick and tock - like a heartbeat at a resting level. Oddly enough, listening to a baseball game, be it on on radio or just in the background - the nine innings of commentary can help reset one's chaotic ptsd.  If you are going through a bad situation 2.5hrs of one game can really help settle and re-set.

Look, it works for me. You might give it a try. Anyone can do this, and with other things of interest. 

The cellist Yo-Yo Ma always starts his practice with this specific piece - Bach's Cello Suite No.1. Great piece (and only 3mins). If you are in a pinch (ie. out in public, and have a flare-up of your ptsd) this is a great device to listen to, to reset. Here is the link to the piece. Keep it on your phone in case you need to, well, listen.

He's friends with him on his new acc so I know he's talked to him sense him and his ex wife split.

Slight trigger warning maybe, but I’ve spent years in and out of hospital, on medication and in treatment for complex ptsd and other mental health conditions, I’m covered in scars and was abused and manipulated by my best friend for years. (He was older than me and I’m 17 now) I had to go to court, and talk about what happened to me at just 15. It destroyed me. But I’m just so proud of myself. I never thought I’d be here today. And maybe things will work out and I deserve to recover? Idk just a little boost of serotonin for me  today I guess.

Pride comes before the fall. Fight the feeling of pride. Feel content. The Gnostics spoke about unseen entities they called Archons who feed on happiness, pride, sloth, greed, envy, gluttony and lust; all natural human emotions that we must fight.  Feel content. Don't get their attention, they sense your human emotions like fire.  Obviously, the Gnostics were using metaphor for unhealthy human emotions.  Hey, love is not unhealthy.  Feel love. Love being in that body, scarred or not.  Go do something fun.  And learn to forget what was done to you. Even with the scars as reminders you don't want to think of the past. Not healthy.

How do you deal with being triggered? I am new to feeling triggered and it's awful. When I get triggered I start to panic and dissociate. Today I know why I am feeling triggered, it's because I have to break things off with someone I was seeing romantically and it just triggering that parental wound/feels like abandonment (it's probably more complex than that but idk yet how to explain it very well). I planned on seeing them tonight to tell them we should stop seeing each other, but I don't know if I should wait until I'm feeling less triggered, or just get it over with so I can focus on recovering and coping (kinda like ripping the bandaid off). I had a date planned but maybe we should just have a conversation instead (idk i planned the date before I realized we should probably end things). In any case, any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!	mentallyillnotchill	post	14.61565288000147	female	White	0.9961642026901245	na	na	na	2	ptsd	failed

"Hello love,
i think waiting until you feel less triggered might be the correct call. When you feel triggered, you’re in a heightened emotional state and/or fight or flight mode. Some of the best advice I was ever given: when emotions are high, rationality is low. No one makes their best decisions during episodes/triggers and that’s not your fault- it’s the way your mind and body responds to trauma.

Unless this very person is triggering you by making you feel unsafe- take some time to think about why that might be. If my trauma has taught me anything it’s to pay attention to my instincts in situations like this. 

In terms of coping with triggers- think of the things and/or people that make you feel safe. Remember it’s natural to feel this way and it’ll get easier with time.
I hope this is helpful, look after yourself because you’ve got this 💚"	mentallyillnotchill	reply	na	na	na	0.9961642026901245	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
"I've (26m) relapsed tonight and had a bad flashback episode. My partner of 2 years (27m) has never seen this happen to me before, it's been that long since it happened. He is autistic, and is really struggling with how to support me - both while it's happening (if it happens again) and im unable to communicate my needs, and also in the hours and days afterwards when my brain continues to do funny things.

I know about adrenaline crashing and hypervigilance after an episode but would love some written resources on that kind of stuff to send him as this is the best way he receives information. 

I also know a lot about verbal grounding (such as telling me where I am and the date and explaining our present)  but again, would like some resources on that to share with him. That way if it happens again I'm not gonna be non-verbal panicking while he also panics not knowing what he should do 🥲"	daddyCharlee	post	27.44735585243497	male	White	0.9947388768196106	na	na	na	4	ptsd	failed

"I had a bit of a breakthrough today and I just felt like sharing to see if there's anyone out there that's going through similar shit but might be a few steps further down this path than I am.

  
It's been recently brought to my attention that a huge component in my anxiety about going out and meeting new people (I currently have zero social network outside of my therapist) is my trauma response... **fawning**... where my boundaries just sorta disappear.  I am super polite and respectful, I genuinely listen and stay fully engaged, but I deeply struggle to walk away or interrupt or cut them off to tell them I have to leave, stuff like that.  It legit feels like trying to make myself jump down a zipline or something.  That ""don't be rude"" thing is just so deeply rooted, and it often leads to me feeling a bit trapped, or powerless or vulnerable.  In a lot of ways, I'm afraid it throws off my ability to even accurately gauge whether I'm in a healthy/safe interaction or not, because I just sorta adopt that whole ""look on the sunny side"" or ""I just met my new best friend"" or ""they don't mean it"", shit like that.  It often makes me feel very... naïve and childlike, and that's really embarrassing and doesn't feel safe, and doesn't inspire confidence to go back out and try again, especially *alone*.  So... I fear I might be overlooking red flags in order to be nice and make potential friends, and I fear being peer pressured and taken advantage of... at risk of them getting upset, and angry, and abusive... because that has happened *regularly* in the past.  And that fear... often leads to me avoiding the ""risk"" of social interactions.  


For example, I've been going to the local skatepark relearning how to skate and a woman approached me the other day and just started talking to me for 2 hours, when I was clearly in the middle of skating alone in a skatepark.  And she was really nice, but just... talked about herself most of time, and didn't really seem to notice or care that I was just standing there with my skateboard the whole time when I came there to skate...  And I... was super overwhelmed because I hadn't talked to a human face-to-face longer than just the passing ""hello"" in the apartment building hallways in months.

  
So... what I'm struggling with is... I'm afraid that I've kinda... confused my fawning response for *confidence*.  Because it does feel a bit like confidence when I'm in the moment.  I feel like everything is going great and I'm being really nice, we're getting along and I'm really listening and being a good friend... but like... I kinda want to skate and she doesn't seem to notice... but I'll just stand here and get eaten by mosquitos while she keeps talking about her ex-boyfriend... and... oh, it's been half an hour and it's getting dark out now...

  
I was just wondering if... anyone else has a problem feeling safe going out because they're afraid they're going to fawn to the wrong kind of people?  Or just, I guess anything fawning in general, because I'm pretty newly waking up to my tendency to do this.  Maybe like... some tips on stuff to work on around that.

A lot of people push ""just say yes to social plans"" when you struggle with isolation and trying to make new relationships, but... what I'm reading about retraining fawning is kinda all about learning how to say ""no"" to people... so I'm just... a bit confused and I don't really know how to approach this.  Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this book."	Feisty_Animator5374	post	20.283351222485628	male	White	0.9970753192901611	na	na	na	14	ptsd	failed

This registered with me a lot. Most of my trauma comes from relationships and this is definitely one of the hardest, longest-lasting parts of my trauma. It makes it so hard to genuinely connect. I think one of the big steps that helped me move forward a little bit was accepting that if you state a boundary or have to make someone uncomfortable, such as taking up space in the conversation or diverting it, the uncomfortable part will pass and the appreciative part will appear. People really respect and appreciate it when you make your needs clear and understandable, and it makes you much easier to get along with in the long run.

">That ""don't be rude"" thing is just so deeply rooted, 

Yes, it is.  It helped me to bear in mind that *strangers* are the perfect people on whom to practice enforcing my boundaries.

You don't have to be rude, and if you're a fawner, that means that's it's highly *you were indoctrinated* to tend others before you tend to yourself, and it's up to you to take care of and re-parent yourself.

If you don't, who will?

Imagine your inner child as the child you need to protect.

You, the child, is at the skating park, and the sweet ol' lady is monopolizing the time of a child.  The child doesn't want to set there listening to granny go on and on, they want to play.  It's their turn to play.  It's their time to play.

It's up to you, the adult you to step in and protect that child.  Let the child be who they want to be.  Let the child have fun, get some exercise, develop skills, and *maybe* meet someone closer to their own age.

So you ""be polite"" and give granny maybe 10-15 minutes, but granny is being really rude and selfish, and doesn't care what the child needs or wants.  

Whatchya gonna do, mom/dad?  You gonna stand there and watch your child be neglected?

There's no guilt, because the child doesn't belong to granny, but to you, and granny's trying to steal the child's playtime.  The child was polite, even made sure granny was okay, asked she needed water and if she knew where she was, the whole nine yards.

Is the skatepark where granny goes to monopolize the time of young people who she feels entitled about and can dominate over?  Why isn't she at the community center, playing cards or knitting, maybe volunteering at a shelter or church?  

So I ask you:  Who's being rude?  The granny, or the parent protecting their child?

NO!  NEVER AGAIN WILL YOU ALLOW THAT CHILD TO BE NEGLECTED OR ABUSED!

It's not about you, the adult, but about your inner child who desperately needs your love, help and support.

As you leave the park, if granny is still there, you wave bye as you leave, saying, *""It was nice to speak with you!""*  You don't pause or stop, you say it as you're leaving.  THAT'S the polite thing to do.

*If at any point, granny seems to be in medical distress, you call 911 and get professional help for her.*"	Feisty_Animator5374	reply	na	na	na	0.9970753192901611	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
This is the number 1 reason why I self isolate, it pisses me off when I know someone can sense my discomfort (especially when trying to leave/end an interaction) but they pretend not to and act suprised when eventually I announce I have to go.

"Thank you.  It's reassuring to hear this, and the way you've phrased it actually does remind me of times I have successfully created those boundaries and it was completely normal, or the other person actually treated me as thoughtful.

I'm sure comfort with this comes with practice.  Unfortunately, isolation is the last place you can practice social skills like that.  That's been a struggle I don't really know how to navigate - how to practice boundaries with... no one.  So I feel like my way to practice this is... I need to get out into the world and just... practice ways to *leave* conversations politely.  Kinda counter-intuitive when you're deeply socially starved and need to be making friends, putting my emphasis on creating *distance* in those moments often feels like I'm deliberately pushing them away and it gets really confusing."

"I mentioned in numerous post. I had a really bad Harassment incident with an adult woman that started out with Online bullying which graduated to In Person Harassment. Some of the things included spreading blatant lies about me, posting my face online for the sole purpose of mocking me, sending her friends to all my pages to spy on me and Darvoing/playing victim. I tried to get legal action involved but failed because it wasn't ""serious enough"" or the people who would take my case were unaffordable, so now I have to deal with her basically getting away with it and being frequently triggered by her.

My PTSD was minor before the In Person Harassment, the worst being anxiety and hypervigilance, but when she harassed me in person it turned to full blown PTSD as I was traumatized further. I now have sleep disturbances, difficulty concentrating at work, vivid flashbacks of the event and nightmares of her turning to violence and no one helping me. 

So I decided self help is not going to help. No matter how much I try to ground and self soothe, the anger, the fear and rage is not going away. So I decided to go look for a therapist that specializes in Trauma. 

The problem is I have Medcaid that makes it difficult to find a therapist and I don't have the financial means to pay 100 dollars per session. So if anyone who has been in my position has any advice for me on finding some strong resource to help me without breaking my wallet please let me know.

"It doesn’t happen often, maybe a few times a year at most, but will snap on my bf over nothing, idk what happens or even what sets me off. I was in an abusive relationship in which my ex tried to literally brainwash me and kept me on acid, he tried change every one of my actions and habits and every part of my personality. so yeah I have a lot to deal with from that. 

Usually if I get triggered from something small I might cry or just have general feelings of fear through the day, but sometimes I just fly off the handle and start saying things that are mean and don’t even  make sense, reasoning with me in the moment just makes it worse. Its very out of character for me to act that way. It’s hard to know what random a normal thing will set it off because so many mundane things were twisted in weird ways to control me or break me down. I can’t remember what year he did this, it’s been like maybe 6 or 8 years since it happened. 

When it happens remember it starting, I remember how intense I suddenly feel, but I don’t remember what I said, I don’t remember what happens after that. After I’ve come down and my bf tells me what I said it doesn’t even make sense that I would have gotten so upset, why I said those things and even contradicted myself many times. Trying to think about it makes me feel both like my mind is tied up in tight knots and at the same time like my thoughts are in slow motion and I can’t grab them to sting together in my mind. I can’t picture or hear any of the words of what happened. i just see a big lump of images that my brain can’t make sense of. Like the memory turned into goo.


Idk am I going crazy ? Does anyone else have this happen? I know, I know, I need therapy, I’ve been trying to get in for months after not really being compatible with my last therapist. I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this and my bf is at work, already stressed to the max as it is."	xpickles23	post	26.960161845009942	female	White	0.9973251819610596	na	na	na	1	ptsd	no prediction.

I’m currently home back where my trauma happened. It’s really tough, I’m in freeze and feel like my whole family is against me. All I do is hide in my room and try to avoid everything but my brain is going through a living nightmare and I don’t know what to do to feel safe..I’ve not got the resources financially to leave right now otherwise I’d be gone. I don’t know how to stop my mind racing and all the fearful thoughts. Everyone feels like a threat and my family think I’m making it up. They don’t understand why I can’t just “get over it” feeling so on edge right now I just need a bit of support/advice on how to deal with this. Everything feels like a trigger. All my normal resources aren’t working. It’s so intense and I’m worried I’ll completely lose it.	PollyPiper11	post	12.89575272821413	female	White	0.9497771859169006	na	na	na	3	ptsd	failed
"PTSD is a nightmare… and I don’t have a great solution for you as I still get triggered a lot and I understand that our body collapses and we feel like we can’t escape, for that reason I dissociate a lot. 

Anyway someone once said to me:

“When you’re in a loop of thinking, put some music and start singing the lyric, your brain can’t focus on both the thinking and the singing”

I know it’s not a greaaaat solution and for me as I also have ADHD it doesn’t work very well buuuut there was some times it actually worked, and maybe it works for you(?). 🤷🏻‍♀️

Also yes, I know it feels cringe and dumb being deeply sad and triggered and start singing. 🙄"	PollyPiper11	reply	na	na	na	0.9497771859169006	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

I don’t have a lot of advice for you unfortunately. I moved out of the country where all my traumas happened, but I have similar problems when I visit my family.

I experience this too. My therapist called it “collapse.” It is a survival response like fight, flight, freeze. For me, I loose the ability to speak and move. In its most severe, I can’t even move my eyes. It’s triggered by extreme stress caused by verbal abuse.

Growing up I had very bad traumatic events that happened continuously when growing up and as a young adult. I’m easily triggered by my past and I get bad flashbacks/vivid repeat dreams and nightmares/ mood swings but also with (diagnosed bipolar in 2018)/ then these flashbacks gives me panic attacks and I can’t function at work cause of the anxiety and stress of it.  There is a lot more I can list with all of how I’m feeling. But what do they not tell you about ptsd that I should know? Does it last a lifetime? I can’t do EMDR cause it can mess with my bp1. And I was prescribed Prozasin and it’s only been a few days but I’m hoping it regulates me. Will I have to take meds for it forever? I’ve found help and counciling but it doesn’t matter how much I talk about it, it’s still there. How do you all cope with it? Do you still work with this condition? I have so many questions.. but if there’s anything I should know about this diagnoses I’d love to know and learn more about it.

"I’m not exactly sure how to explain this or what is even happening, as I’ve never experienced this before. As a little background, I am a victim of domestic violence and instead of helping me, an evil cop who hates women chose to get me in trouble over the actual perpetrator. He made it his mission to get me in trouble and listen to a man over a woman. I can tell that he’s the type of cop that loves to exert power over others and control women.

The perpetrator attacked me, yet I was the one being accused of doing that. The cop wouldn’t listen to me and submitted an arrest warrant for me. It was granted, and I ended up turning myself in. I knew that this process was going to be traumatizing for me because of this cop. Out of all the cops that work at that station, of course this cop had to be the one to book me in. I’m convinced that he heard that I was coming and purposely came in just so he could be the one to do it. 

The part that was the most traumatizing for me was when my fingerprints were being taken. I thought that fingerprints being taken were just that - fingerprints. But instead, every single inch of both of my hands were put into the system. This cop, again, was the one who did it, and held down every single one of my fingers, turned them in all different directions, and pressed them down hard to put them into the system. It may sound silly, but it felt extremely violating to me. Every time I think about it I cry. I can still see the images of it in my head, and my hands have been tingling ever since. I just want to cut my hands off. It feels like they’re not mine anymore. I’ve never felt anything in my hands before so for them to tingle is extremely strange and uncomfortable. I don’t know if this is possibly trauma coming out, but it’s driving me insane. It keeps making me relive it. 

If another cop had booked me in, I don’t think that I would be having this response. It’s the fact that I know that this cop had a lot of satisfaction that he was successful in getting me in trouble and having full control over me, telling me what to do, and there was nothing I could do about it. I’m completely disgusted that he was the one who did it. I specifically didn’t want to turn myself in because I did not want to see this cop as he had been screaming at me through the phone before we ever met. I wish that my lawyer could have requested for someone else to book me in because I just knew before I even got there that if this cop was the one that I had to see that I would be traumatized. But my lawyer didn’t seem to understand and I don’t think that she would’ve asked because I’m sure the police would’ve said they have no control over the person who does the booking that day. Also, I didn’t want to sound entitled. But trust me, I knew before ever meeting this cop that if he was the one handling it I would be traumatized. And I was afraid if I asked not to have him that they would then purposely get him to do it to torture me. So I guess maybe it was better he didn’t know I didn’t want him to do it. But I hope it was worth traumatizing me for life. 

I try not to think about it, but then my hands start to tingle and I feel like I’m forced to think about this disgusting, evil cop. It makes me want to scream, like I can’t escape it. It’s haunting me physically and mentally. I don’t understand how it’s possible for my hands to even feel like this. I don’t want to think about this anymore. It gets to the point where I keep seeing the visions of what happened, the exact moments my hands were pressed down, and I  get so frustrated that I cry and have a breakdown. 

I just had to get it off my chest because I feel like I’m losing my mind."	Playful-Criticism437	post	19.74781778658262	female	White	0.9978460073471069	na	na	na	5	ptsd	no prediction.

"It's common to get tingly hands or even have the tingling creep up your arms, when you're anxious. It happens because you might be subtly hyperventilating or taking in less oxygen, and your body goes into fight or flight mode, distributing blood to your vital organs rather than your limbs. There can even be some pain or stinging in your hands after a little while of not getting proper blood flow. But if you're able to calm down and relax, it will go back to normal.

It's possible that you're noticing it more now, because of the trauma related to the fingerprinting. I'm really sorry, it's hard when your own body or bodily sensations are triggers for PTSD.

I'm not sure if this would help you, but one thing I used to do when I had similar ""body triggers,"" was to play with fidget toys, to move my physical attention somewhere else. Or I'd do really fast sudoku or chess puzzles on my phone... any game that can take all of your attention & focus elsewhere."

"One of my biggest hurdles is forming good habits of literally any kind, I have just recently managed to start my day every day with a deep calm breathing exercise and it’s a huge fucking win. I read some advice on Reddit, I’ll try to summarize because I couldn't find it again but I’m going to try to put it into practice. Choose three levels of morning routine, 1 being something totally doable (for me,  breathing exercise, taking my meds, drinking water), 3 being what you want your morning to look like (for me, as before but also yoga, breakfast, meditation, hygiene and skincare) and 2 being an achievable but aspirational goal (I’m not sure what this will be for me besides breathing, meds, water). And then you do your best to hit your goals but do not let yourself miss two days in a row of your level 1 routine. Now I’m buzzed on the success of just breathing every morning I’m gonna try to build on it.

Edited to add that I decided on a level 2 routine and it’s 1 (breathing, water, meds, brush teeth) + eating breakfast and doing a chore. Since I got all of routine 1 done AND ran the dishwasher this morning, I’m very incentivized to eat something so I can check this off as a level 2 day. I’ve got many physical issues that would be vastly improved by hitting my aspirational level 3 routine daily so, that’s the goal, having a routine that helps me heal physically and mentally."

Yes I find it helps me immensely as it's something I can control. My routine may seem a bit extreme to some but the benefits have been great. It was hard to start however after 3 months or so it became easy. If you're struggling starting my advice would be to start small then add things as time progresses. You could start simply by setting an alarm so you wake up at the same time every day and build off of that. Whatever you decide make sure it fits into your lifestyle.

"It is super freaking hard sometimes but yes, some routines have helped me. Starting during my worst days I made sure I always went through a walk, usually early in the morning, ideally through nature. I actually had really horrible episode just this week and after not sleeping the entire night I walked 10km in the morning while talking into my phone to somehow not go insane, processing, and it did a lot for me \[I've actively started having symptoms 17 years ago and most of the time it's okay to deal with in daily life now but this week was brutal. I'm better again now.\]

These days the most important thing for my mental health is to go to the office. I make my own schedule 90% of the time and could mostly work from home but it fucks with my brain if I don't leave the house for a while and makes everything worse. So even if noone is there, even if I work for only an hour or two or even just sit in the office and browse the web on a bad day. I try to always go there during weekdays because it helps to keep some symptoms at bay. If I don't go for a longer time then anxiety, paranoia, disassociation, depression and the likes get worse after a time and it becomes harder and harder to leave the house after a while.

I have also found that doing a lifting routine multiple times a week helps me maintain a bit of a mental health standard during times I might not go to the office much or otherwise need more to cope.

Routines are still hard af because of everything and having ADHD on top of C-PTSD doesn't exactly make things easier haha but it definitly helps me.

Adding to this - for a small exercise routine, i found [Darebee.com](https://Darebee.com) insanely helpful as they have a lot of very good \[100% free\] programs and it was helpful for me to get into doing exercise by just choosing a very basic program and just do tiny exercises every day and then slowly building on that.

"TW: sexual assault, break-ins

I feel absolutely insane, so I don’t know how much sense any of this will make. I can barely get my mind to settle for more than half a second. I’m just a wreck. 

I was sexually assaulted by a close friend while I was sleeping, 8 years ago. Ever since then, sleep has been a big trigger for me. I can’t sleep in a room with other people, my door has to be locked, and I wake up throughout the night. I usually leave a sleep recorder on at night because it gives me peace of mind that nothing happened without my knowledge. I have poor vision and when I take my glasses off at night, I jump at every shadow and it takes me hours to feel safe enough to fall asleep. One of my biggest fears is that someone will come into my house while I’m asleep.

Last night, I decided I was not going to set my sleep recorder because I wanted to work on my anxiety. I always keep my door locked but I didn’t check last night. I had a THC gummy to help my anxiety and went to bed. I woke up to the sound of loud rubber boots at about 2am, but both my cats were in bed with me (they would not be in the room if a stranger was in the home) and when I turned on a light, I didn’t see anyone or anything in the hallway. I didn’t feel like I could leave my bedroom. I figured I just dreamt it, especially because I’ve had a history of audio/visual hallucinations. 

When I was leaving for work, I noticed that my door was unlocked and ajar. The doors in my complex stick badly and make a very loud noise when closed. I figure if someone got in, they wouldn’t have closed it, to avoid waking me up. Nothing in the house was stolen or out of place, but I cannot help the persistent anxiety that someone was in my house. My complex does not have cameras in the hallway, so I have no way to confirm. I ordered a doorknob jammer and a door alarm for my peace of mind, but I am overwhelmed with fear and anxiety. 

I don’t know where to go from here. I’ve spent 8 years convincing myself that my fear has been unfounded, but now I feel like I was right all along and I should’ve been more careful. I feel especially paranoid right now, especially because I have no confirmation that someone broke in. And it might have all been my fault if I forgot to lock the door."	thisisasalt	post	27.510715154524764	female	White	0.9988356232643127	na	na	na	8	ptsd	failed

"I'm not going to gas light you but there are several things to ask yourself.

What is the likelihood that on the one day in 8 years you don't do it is the day someone got into your room undetected and assaulted you again? That's got to be unfathomable?

Also, thc is not good for settling anxiety but is likely to trigger drug induced psychosis paranoia and trigger off a host of other issues that will worsen your PTSD.

Also trauma induced OCD means that the very fact you didn't follow your compulsions means you are likely to be facing a deluge of anxiety right now and trying to show yourself how the compulsions are required. 

You need to find some more healthy ways to fight this. CBT, emdr, sleep hypnosis, meditation and medication are king. I hope this helps. Also there's nothing wrong with making sure your house is secure but if you have no physical trauma, no disturbed furniture or possessions and the history you have eluded too you need to make sure you are thinking with your frontal lobe not your brain stem."	thisisasalt	reply	na	na	na	0.9988356232643127	weak	no	strong	na	ptsd	failed

OP, whether or not someone broke in, Don’t be hard on yourself. Shit happens. You responded well with getting a doorknob jammer which is a great tool. I have one and my 6 ft 2, 200 lb boyfriend tested it and could not open the door.

"Masking is a coping strategy for a lot of people who live with adversity they cannot reasonably expect others to understand. 

It's easier to give people people the answer they expect than to watch them short circuit when they face a part of life that they have no experience with.

On top of that, a lot of very nice normal people get very irrational when they are out of their depths, try to give advice, or tell you how to fix your ""problem"" or do their best to pretend that you don't exist.

It's a headache, and an extra layer of stress that has to be accounted for, rather unfairly, when what you face every day the second you open your eyes can feel like it's already too much.

I spent the better part of 4 years coming to terms with my past, my overall mental health, depression, and generally fighting to survive. 

I did that all on my own, while clawing my way out of homelessness, ending a 9 year marriage, and losing custody of my kids.

After all that was over I withdrew from everything, even thinking unless I had no choice. 

I had cast aside everything that got in the way of moving forward and surviving.. until there was nothing left to give and finally I lost myself. 

Lost in a void of aimless apathy is somehow stumbled into someone else, broken but fighting still. She reminded me I wasn't dead. That I still had a choice. And then she left me. 

After that happened.. I broke all the way. The last shred of my ego that was stopping me from really changing how I wanted to see myself snapped and I made a promise with myself.. Not to be better or do better. But to never tell myself a convenient lie to hide from an uncomfortable truth. 

After that my life became focused on a single goal. 

Fixing the way I think about myself, other people, and where I'm going with my life so I would never have to watch what I love turn into ash in my hands again. 

Do you want to know what I learned about other people from all that? 

That real compassion and empathy are as rare as a real evil and cruelty. Most people are a complicated mess of contradictions that somehow manage to form a seemingly normal person.

I had to face my flaws or die. A normal person. Who's lived a good life, has no idea how hard things can get. If they did, it would break them or they'd repress it so they can continue living out the story they tell themselves.

I'm ranting a bit...

What I really want to say, is that one valuable thing I've found that gives me strength, was learning how to talk about my past and struggles with anyone. I can't always do it, but when I can, because of what I've lived through, help them find an answer that puts them on a better path.. That's almost worth the pain I live with. I bleed for my wisdom and now it's up to me to use it for something good. If only to make this shitty world a bit better than it was before I was forced into it.

My mantra is:

One day at a time.

One step at a time.

Make things better.

Even if it's small.

Even if no one will notice.

Making things better, is better than leaving things worse.

I refuse to be made less than I should be because of what I had to live through.

For better or worse, my life is in my own hands.

What I do with it from here, is up to me.

"> including actual therapists 

In *The Body Keeps The Score* and in *Lifting Heavy Things* the authors discuss “pain voyeurs” and specifically in *The Body Keeps The Score* it is stated that an excellent therapist doesn’t actually need to know what you experienced in order to help treat you. 

When I went through CPT my therapist actively discouraged discussing in too much detail what happened; it wasn’t part of the protocol and I made essentially a full recovery without ever telling my therapist the deep details of what happened to me. 

Being vulnerable about your trauma *with someone who is trustworthy* is different than being open about your trauma and using it as a shield to fend off authentic emotional connection/vulnerability with someone.

I found discourse a necessity to growth. There are things in this world that happened to me that caused things I hate talking about. 2 people know about them and I think the most liberating thing I heard from both of them actually was “you were a kid you didn’t know so i don’t blame you you did the best you could with what you had” I’ve also on the other hand had therapist just look at me and tell me they’re so sorry and they don’t know what to say. For me personally it’s not about their reaction on some things it’s more about what I know and what I need to do to fix the behaviors caused by my ptsd. It’s a scary road. There have been moments where I’ve had full blown panic attacks in my therapists arms but the most important thing and the most common thing therapists have told me is I’m safe now and disclosure to the proper people will only assist me in healing.

"It's within my power, with really strong walls, and well-defined limits and boundaries, for it to completely remain under my control.  I don't ""invite"" anyone to inflict *secondary wounds.*  This is going to sound harsh, because it excludes most of ways I choose to share information about my trauma, when I do want to share it with someone.


When among others, if they're being inappropriate (say, joking about trauma, etc.), I set a boundary:

If it becomes necessary, I will say ""I'm a survivor.""  If they ask, ""Survivor of what?"" I respond, ""Extreme trauma.""  If they ask what sort of trauma, it identifies them as inept, uninformed and careless.  CARE-less.  I respond accordingly, ""Why, are you a doctor or therapist?""  

I'm not obligated to explain my traumatic experiences or medical diagnosis to anyone. 

Once the ""extreme trauma"" is out there, it's on them to have limits as to how invasive and careless they become.  Everyone knows what the word ""trauma"" means and when qualified with the word ""extreme,"" the phrase delivered firmly, deliberately, it should have an emotional effect on them similar to a growl from mama bear guarding her cubs.  *no actual growling required*

I put it out of my head long ago that I'm responsible for other people's behavior, their willful ignorance, their choices.  If they're not interested enough in the world (care-less) to understand that millions of people suffer trauma and PTSD, I'm not obligated to educate them.  If they're so socially inept as to try to trounce right over others' personal boundaries, like delving into and digging around in their trauma and medical history, I'll show them what a boundary looks like, staring them square in the eye: DO NOT ENTER.  (Why, are you a doctor or therapist?)  If you want to be more direct, a firm ""Don't go there."" will serve as well.

If they keep pushing, if they try to enter, I have three choices:  

1. Go deadly silent, give them a slow, superior, head-to-toe glare, down and back up, meant to silently ask: ""Are you really this stupid?"", slowly look away, and speak no more on the subject; ignore them as if they don't exist.  Mentally practice, and practice with a mirror if you want.  

2. Go on the verbal offensive.  Ignore their question, and ask them an invasive, personal question designed to make them spit their coffee out.  *""I've heard you enjoy threesomes, is it true?""*  My, how the tables turn.  You have just completely removed them (or the group) from thinking about your trauma and into thinking about the offensive person.  There's thousands of offensive ""I've heard"" questions.  Aim at their softest spots.  *""I hear you play a lot of online games here *(at work)*, what's your best score?""*  *""Did you really buy the answers to the history exam?""*  Your aim is to put *them* on the defensive.  You usually need only one question, and if they ask where you heard it, nonchalantly respond, *""Around...., I don't really remember....""* In the ensuing awkward silence, have a change of subject ready, - sports, a popular show/movie, the horrible traffic congestion with the repairs going on... 

3. Consider that they're young and naive, don't know what they're doing, and deflect with a ""parental"" tone, *""Maybe we can talk later.""*  Say it no more than twice, the second time more firmly, and if it doesn't work, move to option 1 or 2.  If they're around your own age, ""parental"" can be interpreted as ""slightly condescending.""  

It doesn't matter if you're speaking with an individual or in a group.

My responses gauge the offender, consider what a ""reasonable person"" should know at their age and experience.

Number 3 is a ""mentor mode"" depending on their age and experience.  If we do talk later, I'll try to teach them why it's important to their own health and security to be more aware of the world around them, but still not give a clue as to my trauma or diagnosis.  Be careful not to reveal your personal info, because it can be tempting to alert the young, but you're speaking with someone too naive to understand why whispering or blabbing your details to others would be a violation of your boundaries.  It's their very naivete which makes it both tempting *and* dangerous for you.  

Naivete is not necessarily an age thing.  I've met older ladies, sheltered their entire lives, who haven't a clue as to the dangers in the world.  I'm not nasty to them, but in this area, my trauma, I still treat them like the emotional children they are.  Other than that, people who've had access to the internet should know better, if they have the first ounce of empathy in them.  If they have no empathy, all the more reason to ferociously, fearlessly defend my boundaries.

Those old enough to know better, those being intentionally cavalier and insensitive, they get the full ignorance and/or invasion treatment (1 & 2).  

It's in the news every damn day.  From newborns to the very old, across every social spectrum, in every part of the world, survivors exist.  Just saying you're a survivor should be enough, but if it's not, know how to react.

Survivors are not ""helpless victims.""  In order to begin healing, we must deal with the realities of our dangerous world, deeply question and examine ourselves, and work with those with whom we cohabit.  We must meet and embrace the ""new"" person we will become, and deal with those effects on the people we love and who love us.  We deal with triggers and flashbacks, and if we can do all that PTSD and/or cPTSD entails, we can dominate a care-less, blithering idiot trying to invade our boundaries.  If they ""don't care,"" I don't waste my time with them.  Time is our most precious gift, as we all have learned.

We ""owe"" the willfully ignorant nothing.  We have sacrificed enough, beginning from the initial trauma.

We survived, we know it, and we can use the power and wisdom thereof to our best benefit.  


I feel I should add:

With actual children, an ""I was hurt (or am sick) and don't feel very well right now."" or other non-traumatizing statements are appropriate.  It's our duty to teach them, not to traumatize them.  Also, being kids, they will blab your story with interpretations and in terms you never spoke, and, it can happen with their peers and their parents, neighbors, teachers, bosses and coworkers, at church, in the store, ...you name it.  They're not stupid, they love you as only a child can, want to understand, want to be involved in helping with the changes they see in you, want to defend you.  The fewer details they have, the better for both of you.  You're modeling your boundaries, and teaching them their limits.

If they also experienced the trauma, it's appropriate to to seek the help of counseling to guide your communications with them, never denying their trauma and the effects on them, but generally speaking, let the child guide and control the conversation, affirming *their* memories, experience and feelings, not ""dumping"" your own or ""correcting"" their memories and experience.  It can be really difficult when you both suffered the same trauma and they're triggering you.  If it gets really bad trigger-wise, say you don't feel well and need a bathroom break.  Then return and be available again.

There's also appropriate and inappropriate ways to discuss your trauma with adults, if and when you want to share it.  Blurting it out without consent is not okay, because we never know who has been traumatized, or at what stage of healing they may be.  

&nbsp;

Examples:

**Walls:** Permanent structures that are never to be breached. These involve rules like: I will [never tolerate abuse](https://www.verywellmind.com/signs-that-a-relationship-could-turn-violent-4100203), mental, emotional or physical. I will never intentionally harm another except in defense of self or others. I will never commit a crime, or, associate or participate with those who do. I will never risk or sacrifice my home for immediate desires ...and so on.  This outer wall protects our *physical security*, not our *emotional safety*.  Emotional safety belongs in the realm of boundaries and limits.

**Limits:** How far I will go for someone else, and for *whom*?  Never breaching my walls, what am I willing to sacrifice and do for someone else? Yes, I'll run out in the middle of the night for a friend, and set with them at the hospital for hours and hours. Yes, I'll buy them groceries or pay for rent, electric or medical when tough times hit. No, no way am I buying illicit drugs or alcohol for an addict, but I'll take meals, shampoo, broom and mops, whatever, set with them when they need me. Do I risk my job (which pays for my home) to do these things?  No, because that would breach my wall.  ...And so on.

**Boundaries:** How far do I let them in? Again, never breaching my wall, do I reveal my [fawning skills](https://apn.com/resources/fight-flight-freeze-fawn-and-flop-responses-to-trauma/)?  Do I reveal my generosity, and if so, what *types* and *means* of generosity (time, emotional, financial) am I willing to reveal?  *In what circumstances* will I make these revelations - among strangers, friends, associates, family, to *brand new* people?  

Walls are permanent, unyielding and become stronger with time.  Limits and boundaries move, flex and breathe, but never beyond your ""comfort zone"" (breaching your walls).  It helps to keep evolving (written) lists, because as you heal and mature *(no one ever stops learning and maturing)*, so will your capacity and capabilities.

Yeah, this is a good outlook and what I've always tried to focus on too. Keeping it functional. Focusing on recovery. 

Not worrying about who I am. Worrying about fixing the problems.

After reaching the point of remission, I guess it's like I finally have the luxury of being able to try to figure out who I am now to the world, and to myself. You know?

If an event caused PTSD, it's guaranteed to be terrible.

It's about never being able to talk about the whole thing, and connect fully with other people who've been there. Always having to just talk about one piece of the situation per room.

So long story short, I grew up without any. My family never hugged, hold hands etc. So I was touch starved and it warped how I view love. I'm currently with someone that we are having issues and I respect that right now he doesn't feel comfortable with any intimacy. He is okay with hugs but he still feels uncomfortable so I feel bad asking for hugs. I am trying to self cope with the loneliness and feeling unloved. What can I do? I am going to look into programs that might offer massages. I have tried weighted blankets they make me feel trapped. Any advice helps.

This is going to sound weird at first, but learn to hug yourself. When I was in your position I started to do this meditation where you first consciously wrap one hand around yourself, then the other, and then rub your arms up and down and squeeze. With meditation it gives you the physical sensation and it ticks one of the many boxes physical contact is filling and at least for me it helped to curb the initial need until I was in a mental space to receive it from others. It also made me feel safer so I did this dozens of times a day.	Ill_Introduction588	reply	na	na	na	0.9901111721992493	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
I’m dealing with the same thing. It sucks but respecting our partners boundaries is huge. Weighted blankets, massage, cuddling with pets and also asking friends for hugs are all good options.

"I’m scared to let go of trauma/anger because I feel like it’s what’s given me my drive and I don’t want to lose that edge. 

A lot of people had it worse than me but I didn’t grow up easy and that was compounded by poor city environment/experiences as a young child/teen then serving in the military. 

However I’ve worked myself into a really great position in life and part of me feels like the edge I have from my experiences is what got me here, a chip on my shoulder. 

I don’t want to continue to live like this but I’m also scared if I let go I’ll lose part of that drive that helped me stand out to begin with. 

I’m also scared of letting go because I live in a city where violence isn’t uncommon, I’m worried if I let go of my past experiences I might freeze under pressure in the situation I have to protect my family and/or myself. I’m not a violent person by nature and any time I’ve been in a situation that required it I had to get myself into a different headspace.

"There's two things you're expressing here:

1. feeling like your trauma has driven you to be successful.
2. feeling like your trauma has taught you how to stay safe in a truly dangerous city.

&#x200B;

First,  for point 1) I used to feel this way. I dont know how many years you've been operating from this headspace, but I did it for about 15 years straight. **I was driven by anger,  by spite, and by a desire to succeed to prove others (and myself) wrong. And boy did this WORK**. I was focused, I was single minded, I was determined. And I was SUCCESSFUL.

I had drive in me that I didn't see in any one of my peers and I steamrolled passed my competition easily. It felt like I had an endless tap of this pure, raw, rageful energy and it felt like this tap would run endlessly. It felt like I could go on forever, and it was working so well. I was succeeding in school, and then in work, and I was killing it. For years!

And then one day

It stopped. The tap stopped. Overnight. It turns out it was not endless. And overnight I gave up everything I had spent years working for. Within the next 6 months I gave up my dream career and I was suicidal and in an inpatient hospital.

My point is that *living your life fueled by embers of trauma \*does\* work extremely well, until it doesn't anymore.* 

It feels like an endless supply of fuel, until it dries up. Being a controlled burn, being more moderate and more balanced is more sustainable long term. Being driven by trauma is not sustainable. **This is a lesson I am still grappling with. My body said no FOR me, it felt like I didn't even have a choice to stop.** *My warning to you is that one day the endless tap energy from your trauma may dry up just like mine did.* And then you're in this weird position where you have to find some other source of motivation. I still haven't found one :(

&#x200B;

Now to your second point.

This is something I learned in therapy: **""Its not keeping you safe, its keeping you sick""**

This basically means: all the hypervigilance, all of the distrust, all of the rituals and behaviors you do to ""stay safe"" and ""stay prepared"" and ""stay ready"" - they are not actually keeping you more safe. They're keeping you more sick (with PTSD).

It sounds like you kind of already understand this concept. Its really hard to let go when there are true threats around you. **Rather than trying to convince yourself that the threats are not real, you want to instead start to build trust in yourself that whatever comes your way - you will be able to handle it.** Whether that means preventing something bad from escalating, or whether it means coping with the grief that something DID happen out of your control: you will be able to handle it.

This self trust isn't easily built and it takes time.

I think its ultimately accepting that there is only so much you can control. And all the hyper vigilance in the world can't truly make you invincible :("	Friendly-Presence408	reply	na	na	na	0.0029866115655750036	no	no	no	na	ptsd	failed

"I keep coming across posts like yours that i resonate so much with, and empathizing with your position has made me reflect on my experiences.

I find that there aren’t many stories from people who have come out the other side of treatment/healing/processing. I lived in a trauma response for so long because I never knew that it could get better, and I had no idea what better even looked like. So. If it’s helpful. This is what my experience of healing, and then getting retraumatized, has been like.

Processing the trauma and getting out of crisis, has made me _better_, more driven, and more grounded during new trauma or just times with a lot of stress. I actually “graduated” from therapy. my trauma symptoms had become so manageable and I had learned so many skills to navigate stress, I didn’t need regular treatment . And then i had another trauma, and went back to therapy with full blown symptoms.

Except round 2 has been _so much easier_ to survive because my nervous system has had a break for the past few years that my symptoms have been managed. It didn’t bring up everything from the past, it was just this one horrible present moment. (What a concept) I have felt confident in myself and my decision making, in a way I had never been before I went to treatment. Navigating and processing this trauma had been night and day of difference.

There was kind of a refractory period when I was in treatment where I had to shift my productivity from work/life goals and put all my energy towards healing. That doesn’t mean I’m less productive or driven, it just means I’m throwing all that energy into strengthening and repairing myself. 

The ONLY edge that I’ve lost is a minor day to day physiological thing - without all the cortisol, I have to use discipline to get me to the gym which is a BUMMER. It’s worth the tradeoff because I’ve had a lot fewer injuries since I’m not using overexercise as self harm anymore. My relationships are also way better since I’m not constantly on edge and combative.

But letting go of it made it possible for me to start having a new drive. 

Doing things out of joy and love and desire to succeed. Not anger and fear.

I don't even know if it's possible to deliberately let go. I couldn't.

A stuck point is an unreasonable belief caused by trauma. 

You think if you're not constantly on edge and switched on you won't be able to reasonably respond to a threat. 

This is unrealistic. Your headspace 24/7 doesn't need to be there. 

I'm certain you can ID a threat long before it becomes hostile and neutralize it as needed. 

Constantly being paranoid isn't healthy, you can totally deal as it comes. I'm still learning how to drop this paranoia myself, one of the things I remind myself of is that it won't be me on the nightly news.

But recently been thinking that the aim of my therapy and living is to by in the middle zone to lift up from freezing and to make the intensity below fighting mood.

This actually I think the best place to be, I feel if a person continues to respond in fight mood, in situations when they want to challenge others, like if they saw something wrong or if they don't think that the other is treating them right, they end up in fawn response.

Lol you don’t want to lose your edge but idk how to tell you this that people with ptsd do not have this edge you’re talking about and they actually function much better. I was only laughing because I relate but more so with a sense of doom. PTSD and trauma responses are actually your brains way of protecting yourself so it makes sense to not want to let go of it because ultimately it does keep you safe from emotional or physical harm that you can’t process all at once. You have to make a point though to not lose yourself in your trauma and maybe try like really subtle exposure therapy so you can help yourself, and talk to more people that don’t have PTSD(or at least people that are working on it anyway) so you can have a model for what healthier mindsets and remember that there is more to life than trauma. It’s nice to have community with other people with PTSD but since we all have PTSD I feel like we don’t always give each other the most healthy advice or perspectives.

"Something similar is distressing me lately. I feel compelled to have this hair trigger that I know on some level is a symptom. In that I deeply feel the need to immediately shut down any mildly unpleasant or unsafe situation before it escalates. So immensely that sometimes in the moment I often have zero restraint and I overreact: viciously, violently, and without trying to amicably deescalate in the slightest. A little part of my mind is always sitting in some place where it soaks in violence and brutality.

It feels like I'm holding on to this horrible explosive anger and disgust, and a part of me is really afraid to stop doing that because I'm afraid someone will hurt me or the people I care about if I do. And some of my friends and I survived a lot of really hideously vile situations by what we used to call ""shutting shit down."" Like, if someone was going to get hurt it wasn't going to be us type of shit.

I rationalize by reflecting on times I was victimized, but a. My hand was forced in those moments. And b. they shouldn't have happened anyway. I think that we have to understand there is a difference between being prepared and being hyper vigilant.

One healthy outlet I have found for myself is to seek out emergency preparedness certifications. So far, I've been formally trained in CPR/AED, First aid and Stop the Bleed which is mostly tourniquet discretion/usage, mental health first aid and de-escalation, and overdose response. It's been extremely helpful because it makes me feel less fearful of emergency situations because I feel more confident to respond, and it gives me a better set of memories to draw from when I am responding to some sort of dangerous scenario.

I'm still in the hood, but I think I'm getting to the point where I can be someone to look up to. Man, I just want to be someone that kid me would be proud of. It's just hard out here. I see a lot of fucking suffering and fighting, especially because I work with and live around a lot of drug addicts and unhoused people. It's hard to let go of things that kept me alive when I was living the same way, but I'm on the other side of that now and I have to be a person who pours into others now."

"Your story is in many ways similar to mine. I used my rage as fuel to do my job really well. I was a bit uneasy about how much there was there and so I learned to direct it in socially appropriate ways. Still there was shame involved.

After a many years, however, and even with medication and therapy the abusive situation at home made me dissociate and I could no longer rely on it for motivation, unless I turned it inwards.

It's good while it works, but when it stops working it is awful and might lead you to self-harming, numbing, or just totally imploding. Easier said than done, but I have to say it: be kind to yourself, forgive yourself, don't excuse other people's bad behaviour. I wrote a list of what my boundaries were. If you don't know them, and make them based off things that have hurt you in the past. Get yourself diagnosed and medicated for ADHD if you suspect it.

"I completely feel this, especially N.1.

Have been living using the rage from trauma to move myself up for more than 10 years. Last year my work/academic/personal life was so heavy and I was so exhausted from feeling rage/hatred all the time that my body broke down before my mind could. Suddenly I've lost all the energy I had, everything was a lot heavier to accomplish, I couldn't find pleasure in anything at all, lost the will to live and became suicidal (something that only had happened at the start of the trauma). 

I opted then for starting doing therapy, as I saw myself without any other resourceful options. It was the best right thing I could have ever done for myself.

They helped me understand my trauma, what caused it and they also ""corrected"" some misconceptions that I had about the event. And since then I've working to turn down the ""motivating hate"" to accomplish what I want in life, though I'm struggling with the idea of losing this edge. Because of the isolation that being angry all the time causes I have made more enemies than friends in those +10 years, and I've been feeling that the moment I turn this down it'll be the moment where I'm swallowed by the rest of the world.

"Whoa! Exactly. My flight or fight mode DAMAGES relationships. I look at others like “how can anyone be happy”, my triggers are uncontrollable and pushes my out doors in life. For me it’s not an edge.. maybe it is: a razor edge off the cliff of relationships. To be given something that can’t be seen, that’s emotional, stigmatized by friends and family alike it’s not an “edge”.. it’s tragic. I don’t know forgiving relationships this guy has going on, but that’s blessed. My PTSD isn’t forgiven. I deal with my hellish loop without much love and compassion. Flight mode targets at the wrong times, emotional outbursts and feeling attacked. The people around me may have google, but they don’t want to use it to learn more, so lose the edge, but don’t lose those people you are so fortunate to understand.

"yes exactly. Being motivated and driven forward by trauma and rage really just means your body is being fueled by pure raw spicy cortisol lol :( 

It feels like an endless source for energy but it is not, no one can do it forever. and when it starts to dry up- it only makes sense to end up suicidal. 

Finding energy and motivation is so hard now. Especially realizing your perpetrators have long moved on and are unaffected by the trauma they inflicted on you. Realizing it’s a distant memory for them.

Even if you’re succeeding while being fueled by your trauma - it still means your trauma is alive and well and is living rent free in your mind daily. It’s still taking up space, it’s still taking up resources and it gets heavier by the day. 

Eventually you run out of space and now you’re losing your memory and unable to even form new memories :( This is what happened to me. 

I didn’t want to give up my trauma identity (part of me still doesn’t) but my body literally started saying “No” for me - i don’t have any more space left in me to keep holding onto it. 

For the first time in my life I really truly want to put it down and stop carrying it around with me. I’m sick of my abusers living in my head with me.

"I wasn't either when I first heard it. 

Double checking my locked doors, constantly looking over my shoulder, constantly isolating inside my house, canceling on social events - ""its not keeping me safer, its keeping me sicker"" :(

Its true though. 

For years after being abused as a kid I dressed very modestly/very masculine. I felt uncomfortable being feminine because I thought it would ""welcome"" men to abuse me. 

Lo and behold I was abused once again - it didn't matter that I dressed masculine and acted masculine. **Doing all these behaviors to ""keep myself safe from abuse"" didn't even WORK. I still was abused again.** 

Its a painful pill to swallow because it forces you to acknowledge you can't control everything. Even if you try to control everything, there is still so much that will forever remain outside of your control. There are certainly some things we can do to keep ourselves safe and protect ourselves, but a lot of the compulsive/obsessive behaviors of PTSD dont really do much to keep us safe even though they feel like it."

"Yeah absolutely! The short answer was therapy and a LOT of reading! But here’s all the details:

My therapist and I dug through DBT tools, concepts and techniques that I could work with and relate to, specifically feeling mind/thinking mind/wise mind was a HUGE thing for me to be able to reconnect with my body.

After we got that foundation - being able to feel and articulate emotions- we started on anxiety and phobias specifically. At the time, I did not have a PTSD diagnosis. We were assuming it was just a couple of specific anxieties I had (oh boy were we wrong). [The anxiety and phobias workbook](https://www.amazon.com/Anxiety-Phobia-Workbook-Edmund-Bourne/dp/1684034833) was a main tool o worked on outside of therapy b/c it can be done with or
Without a therapist’s involvement.

At about this time, I noticed that I was getting exposed to triggers, without it affecting me physiologically in a big way. My HR would climb a little..:. But the rest of the reaction wouldn’t happen? It was like something had been defused. For example my entire life I’ve been really reactive to flying. The physical sensations trigger a LOT for me. But. I’d fly and after a quick “oh boy! Here we go!” HR increase… I’d get nothing. I used to have a resting HR in the 140s on ever flying and it suddenly dropped to mid-70s, even in turbulence. Other situations that I’d had issues with claustrophobia the same thing. 

That led me to [polyvagal theory](https://ct.counseling.org/2016/06/polyvagal-theory-practice/) and related tools/techniques which has by far had the biggest impact on my quality of life. It’s this wonderful blend of addressing physiology and mind to manage mental health and trauma. I don’t do the best at describing it, but it made me understand and appreciate that tackling my triggers was literally _rewiring a survival instinct_ that is as ingrained in my body and brain as the inherited “don’t touch snakes” and uncanny valley instincts.

Anyways, rewiring some of those instincts has been huge in making my recent regression short term instead of chronic AND recognizing “oh shit. I’ve experienced a stress injury.” It’s normal to have symptoms for a few weeks after a trauma or stressor (like say, a medical emergency I helped with) but if symptoms stick around for more than a month, that’s at risk of becoming PTSD and needs help urgently. I had NEVER heard of anything like an [acute stress injury](https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/mental-health-disorders/anxiety-and-stress-related-disorders/acute-stress-disorder) before I took a first responder class, but it totally changed my understanding of my trauma experiences and made it easier for me to ask for help instead of trying to figure it out alone."

"I’m blessed to be where I’m at now. It wasn’t always like this, especially when I was a younger. I went through a cycle of toxic relationships in my early 20’s, those were the darkest years of my life. I was still living in the middle of my trauma, whereas now I feel I have better control over it, through therapy and maybe maturing a little bit more. 

But I did play a big part in my previous relationships/friendships failing and almost lost the first job I had outside of the military. I also sought relationships with people I should’ve stayed away from because I felt like I was damaged so I didn’t deserve better. But I’m a little bit better now and I’m blessed to have understanding people in my life who know that when I do isolate, maybe in the middle of an argument, it’s not a bad thing. I’m trying to prevent my mind from going to other places. Or when I get stiff and uncomfortable in public, I’m just trying to get over any anxious thoughts I’m having. Usually I just need to sit and take a break to collect myself then I’m good. 

It’s a journey. I recognize how destructive what I called “the edge” can be though. That’s the whole reason behind this post. I’m learning how to live without that as the main thing driving me.

I cried on multiple occasions because of her shear compassion. She spent her last counseling session exploring how to navigate this thing with me. She wants to do walks with me and practice EMDR with me. That made me so excited to hear that! I was with her on my birthday and told her I was doing Rapid Eye movement during our walk in a botanical garden. She said that I’m going to be so tired of mundane it’s going to make me sick, I cried in the middle of Target stating “I just need a safe space”. She has so much love for me, and I don’t understand why. She works the HARDEST for me, and I don’t understand why. I’m excited to stay with her for a bit while I get myself together for my next journey… she’s not family, but she is. Her son calls me aunt. She’s healing. She’s what I need. It’ll be a new journey. I’m not going to give my hopes up yet because I did that with my family… I’m going to remain logical, and grounded as much as I can be (hah!). If she follows through with her word, it’ll be great for both of us. My family also gave me their word and I’m moving Saturday after only 3.5 months… 

My niece posted a nasty-gram on Facebook, yet my account is deactivated and she could have easily called or texted, that passive aggression though! I’ve also been direct about my emotions and what bothers me, perhaps that’s my downfall.

Passive aggressive people can never get along with direct people. 

I am hoping for a better future with my friend. She’s kind of the last life line I have as far as people in my life, but perhaps that’s the lifeline I should have been grabbing at this entire time. I don’t know… I put my trust in the wrong people. I DO KNOW THAT, because of lip service on their end, it wasn’t all me. It damaged all parties. I was extremely honest about what I was diagnosed with shortly before moving in, and was honest about my traumas, what else can one do if they say “you have a safe place” and the reality of it is: it wasn’t.

I’m past anger, I was angry with my niece for a moment, and I’ll block these people from my mobile device soon. Ironic that it’s only going to take a simple block on a phone to create distance.. or maybe not since that distance was already there to begin with… anywho!

"TW: SA and SH

I didn't know where to write this so if there's a better subredit tell me. I don't wanna bother anyone.

Keep in mind I'm also autistic and English is not my first tongue, if it helps.

I need someone to tell me to stop.
I was abused once when I was 5, I don't remember a thing but I know my body does. Every time I get the flashbacks I feel like they are new, like every flashback is from a different time and it's because I don't have the visual memory. 
So the thing is I am gonna retraumatize myself to get the images and just be abused once in my memory and remember just that one time.
I've been talking to an old man who is willing to make horrible things to me and he is also gonna pay me. I've told him everything that my body remembers and he'll sexualy abuse me again, he says he wants to do more to me and I'm consenting cos I want it to be worse (I'm not sure this will be worse cos I'm consenting but anyways) in case I remember it like diferent moments so I can take the worst visuals and feel safe in the visual memory of that ONE time.
I also really need the money and he'll pay me a lot, like more than I need, a lot.

So I really need someone to tell me this is wrong and there will be a time in my life when I won't feel this bad. I really know this is wrong, I know this will hurt me and I will feel worse than I feel right now but I really need to have a place and a person to remember. I also know I will hate myself but I'll have money and I'll breath financially for once. I used to self harm and it's been a year since my last time and I'm afraid this is the same but with a man instead of a blade.

I need advice, please tell me to stop, to block this horrible man who will pay to abuse me knowing the pain that it will cause me and that my mind will stop one day. Or tell me that I've got this and in the long run this will be a good choice and I'll feel better than how I did my whole life. 

I used to go to therapy but I couldn't pay it anymore so I stopped, now that I will be out of debt I could try again. 

Please help me."	L0rdcka	post	22.512960358967348	male	White	0.9938462376594543	na	na	na	8	ptsd	no prediction.

"Hey.

Yes this man will pay you money and it seems like a lot.

But you are paying HIM something too. And the cost you are paying is incredibly high - you are paying with your self worth, your spirit.

Every time we allow someone to hurt us, they take a piece of us with them. It takes YEARS to get those pieces of ourself back. Many people on this sub are still suffering a lifetime later, trying to retrieve these pieces of ourselves. It will hurt you for the rest of your life.

I know the money seems like a lot, but keep in mind that **YOU are paying an even higher price than he is.** You are paying with your spirit.

He does not deserve it. No amount of money is worth it.

&#x200B;

You know the small inner voice that told you to come onto this subreddit and ask someone to stop you?

That voice is Future You, from 30 years in the future.

They want to protect you, they know you dont deserve to be hurt. They know that no amount of earthly money is worth hurting yourself like this.

"When I'm in my head about trauma I haven't been able to face head on yet I notice myself watching videos, movies, whatever, that are about true crime or tragedies, stuff like that.

Is this unhealthy? It helps me calm down but it feels fucked up to seek out a movie about a shooting or a really disturbing true crime case.

If I don't seek out something I am left with major anxiety and possibly spiraling until a breakdown.

Recently the memories of my last interaction with my birth mother and her ""boyfriend"" via messenger has been constantly on my mind and making me consistently anxious. That interaction ended with me having a breakdown because of how fucked up that situation was and being unable to help my siblings.

This particular scenario keeps me up at night, makes me feel the need to watch disturbing movies or whatever, and wonder if I should open those messages again that are just sitting there. It ended with a few voice messages from that ""boyfriend"" who I barely know making fun of my trauma and when I went to the hospital for suicide/selfharm attempts, stuff like that.

Is this a thing other people do and if so, is it unhealthy?"	Tall_Tea4727	post	19.585221965960926	male	White	0.014771530404686928	na	na	na	7	ptsd	failed

"When I was a teenager, I was SA’d by my first boss.

I’d go see a counsellor, however the wait list for one is over a year and I can’t afford a private one.

hi, i’m so sorry you’re going through this. first thing i can recommend is to stay sober. substance abuse is what i did to cope and trust me it makes it worse. try to see a counselor but i will also add this may bring up harder, deeper emotions. i take medication to help me sleep & prevent nightmares (seroquel & prazosin) which is from my regular psych doc. this was what helped me. look at online therapists? go to a general practitioner even to see if they can give you something, even if it’s just resources. it’s so hard to cope sometimes. i’m so so sorry you’re in pain. i hope that you find peace to sleep soon & the needed resources to cope. 🖤	AmbersAweseomeGames	reply	na	na	na	0.021407971158623695	strong	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
"If you know someone who deals with similar issues, PLEASE SHARE THIS.

Hello my symptom companions, I hope you’re not too devastated and still have some hope left for improvement. Today, I can share my story with you. But here is a shortened version for all the impatient readers: SPEECH THERAPY HAS IMPROVED MY CONDITION & I was hopeless before and just accepted my fate.

*So, here is the more detailed version for everyone interested:*

Let’s start of by providing essential information to possible triggers of the psychosomatic in my neck/ throat/ jaw. 

I am diagnosed with CPTSD and PTSD from an abusive relationship/ Anxiety Disorder/ Depersonalizationsyndrome (and my grandmother was schizophrenic).

In my abusive relationship I was often choked, sexually and physically abused and treated as If I was worthless and deserved it. I was in this relationship from the age of 12 until I was 16. Besides other psychological damages, I was ‘doing fine’ until I had developed that psychosomatic issues in just a moment while sitting in a bus to my holiday destination. 

My life has changed in that moment. From that moment I felt like the rest of life-quality was taken from me. I felt powerless. I was angry. I was devastated. I was so scared I had cancer or anything of that sort. I ran from doctors to doctors, hoping that they could help me. Give me an answer. Some tried, some just pushed me away saying it was “only psychological” and “nothing serious”. While the latter statement is not necessarily wrong, it tore me apart. Was I not suffering enough? Why was there no solution?

After some months or even a year, I had come to terms with this ‘disability’. (Please don’t be offended by the usage of this term, it really was a disability that took me all the energy and kept me from enjoying anything in my 18 - 20 years.) 

I finished high-school with a great result in grades. But don’t get me wrong. Studying was not easy but in this torment, it was the only thing I was somewhat capable of. It was not easy at all. But I didn’t give up and I wouldn’t until I found an answer.

After Highschool I went directly to a stationary hospital to get treated and adapt a healthier and better strategy. I got more self-aware and self-reflected. I became calmer and more patient with myself. (This already changes/d a lot). 

Once I went to an ENT again (Probably 5th or 6th time) when I was 20. And he hasn’t found anything serious BUT he gave me a doctor's prescription to speech therapy.

First I was laughing it off, but after a few sessions, I noticed improvement. I’m a bit emotional right now, but I HAVE to share it in case someone is faced with the same fate and feels so alone with their pain and suffering. You are not! 

Please feel free to contact me on this and ask me everything you need to know. If you know someone who deals with similar issues, PLEASE SHARE THIS. If you can’t afford speech therapy, I will make videos to share what I have learned. I will start streaming.

Hugs go out to everyone! Thanks for listening!"	IMJustLin	post	26.536536849720097	male	White	0.007749855052679777	na	na	na	10	ptsd	failed

I have somatic flashbacks and sensations of being choked etc. I constantly have tension in my throat and neck. Its directly related to my trauma. 

Can you explain why speech therapy helps? 

I actually think my airway might be narrow and I went to an ENT too and she was incredibly dismissive. She said I was totally normal and nothing was wrong with me. 

I am currently trying to get a consult for jaw surgery because I know my jaw is recessed and I think it might be affecting my airway which is contributing to the somatic sensations."	IMJustLin	reply	na	na	na	0.007749855052679777	no	strong	strong	na	ptsd	failed

"I also have an overbite and thought it might be related to this feelings and sensations too. However, all the ENTs have said it looks alright. And as I have shared, one of them has given me a prescription to speech therpay. I have doubted that it would make anything better but I have just finished all the 11 sessions and the feeling is so much more bearable. I was even able to start going to eat out at a restaurant for 3-4 years. Of course the way is not easy, I still struggle a little. But I feel like I got some life quality back. I would have never thought that speech quality could improve my life. The thing is, you not only learn how to speak in a healthier way but there is also a lot of breathing exercises as well as ways to relax you jaw/throat/vocal chords etc. And the more I practiced, the more comfortable I feel. 

This post is not meant to give false hopes of a sudden wonder that this feeling will be gone. But in those almost 4 years where I suffered every day, the last few weeks have been more bearable.

"You may or may have not heard about the globus sensation. It’s sort of an umbrellaterm trying to give those with similar issues to mine a diagnose, but it’s not really something that can be treated medically. As there is no ‘medical’ reason why you have this feeling but a ‘psychological’ one. 

In general psychosomatic in throat/neck/ jaw is just a way to explain this conditions. Something that is caused by the nervous system and your psyche, possibly because of an overreaction to stress, trauma, etc.. Psychosomatic issues can be everywhere in your body, but since I only have IBS and this throat clenching feeling, I can only talk about it. 
Here are some of my personal experiences:

Persistent Feeling Of 
     - Being Choked
     - Being About To Throw up
     - Not Getting Enough Air
     - Anxiety 

Persistent Fear Of
     - Having A Serious Disease/ Tumor
     - Being misunderstood
     - Social Gatherings 
     - Intimacy 
     - …

Affects: MENTAL HEALTH, life quality, anxiety level, relationships, career, grades, …

Has anyone experienced PTSD and had psychotic symptoms such as auditory/visual hallucinations and/or delusions?  If so, what helped to improve your condition?  My son is experiencing this.  He is on Risperidone 4mg and Zoloft 150mg per day.  While there has been some improvement, his delusions are constant and he has become aggressive.  Does therapy help? I have seen some mention of EDMR.  We are bound to virtual appointments due to his condition.  He was recently in the hospital.  He does ok there and after a day or two at home it begins to get intense again.  He is also autistic, level one. I think he heavily dissociates during these episodes. He also seems more childlike the last few months. Not sure if it is an autism thing but he stops talking for days at a time.  This has been going on for 8 months.

"Yes, I get this fairly regularly. For me, it's caused by stress. I know I'm not taking good enough care of my baseline stress levels when I experience extreme dissociation in the form of catatonia, and get hallucinations and psychosis. The psychosis for me comes in intense paranoia of cameras and being watched (never get this in my normal life) and faces blending and melting. The only thing that helps me is reducing stressors or taking a break, as soon as I can. I usually go to a very remote cheap Airbnb near me for a few days, and use the symptoms as a sign something needs to change in my current set up to allow more space for recovery work (changing work hours, living situation, just assessing life to see where I can reduce stress generally). The fact his symptoms are better in hospital suggests to me that something about the set up at home is causing him stress, which is pushing him to dissociate.

I also found my psychosis symptoms to be much worse when I was medicated, and I found Zoloft to make my symptoms much much worse. Meds are different for everyone, but generally SSRIs aren't good for PTSD, especially if you are prone to dissociative episodes, and mood stabilisers like Seroquel helped a little more, but not much. 

It's a part of PTSD and EMDR would certainly help in the long run usually, but is also incredibly difficult to go through and if your son is experiencing psychosis right now, he may not be in a place to be able to do it right now. EMDR is TOUGH and I've been in the stabilising phase of therapy for 2 years, building my resources to even begin thinking about EMDR. The psych is right, stabilising the psychosis is necessary before anything else.

If it's not possible to change anything, I make sure to work on somatics, things like working out, exercising, spending time outdoors, yoga, TRE exercises etc. Somatics for PTSD is a good Google if you're interested, wealth of info out there."

I have not, but those questions come up a lot in medical questionnaires, so it must be something the docs look for. Good thing you are seeking help, because you definitely need to be on a medical program. And maybe even be institutionalized for a while. Nothing wrong with being institutionalized.

"Thank you for sharing. It must be so incredibly difficult to experience this.  Your experience reminded me that his doctor also mentioned, when this first began that he seemed catatonic.  After this last hospitalization I too have come to the conclusion that home is a stressor for him.  My struggle is then how to improve that.  I cannot send him with family, not in a psychotic state.  Finding a short term residential center/inpatient has been unbelievably difficult because facilities do not accept individuals with autism, unless you're a child and he is 21. And while i wouldnt be selfish if he was for the greater good, it brings me phsyical pain to think about him being away.  If his father and I were not caring for him there is no way he could care for himself in this state.  It takes a deep understanding of yourself and stressor to be able to recognize that you need a break, such as you mentioned about going to an airbnb.  He unfortunately does not have grasp of his ""reality"". 

He has a Pyschatrist and we have a new therapist but the two sessions he had, my son did not speak.  I feel like we are on a loop for the last 8 months, moreso the last 4. Somatic therapy is a great suggestion. I certainly see the benefit there.  I would love to get him outdoors but in his state I am concerned about elopement. Thank you for your thoughts on EDMR and SSRI. He was prescribed the anti psychotic first and a few weeks later the SSRI.  I have heard mixed reviews of zoloft in general.  I will ask about this at his next appointment.  

I also sought a trained trauma therapist but he did not connect with her at all.  He has also mentioned that he doesn't like to talk about it.  So your suggestion of somatic is actually really good idea.  That light bulb just went off.  Thank you!"	Kaybee7467	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9974228143692017	strong	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

His approach is to stabilize the pyschosis first.  He is not focusing on root cause, at the moment, which I do understand especially because he has become aggressive.  I do wonder how do you truly improve if you don't focus, at least some, in tandem on the root cause. He's thrown out a lot of thoughts but no firm diagnosis.  My son is 21 so when he becomes aggressive it is intense.	Kaybee7467	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9974228143692017	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
"You're honestly so welcome, it took ten years of solo struggle to get where I am, and it makes me tear up to even imagine my parents caring as much as you do, and seeking out information, really really beautiful to see. I'd recommend the work of Peter Levine as a starting point if you'd like to learn a bit more, as his work is really accessible and has a lot of actionable steps in it. 

I wonder if it might be useful for you all to maybe start some gentle conversations about what it might be at home that's stressing him? I know in my case it's usually when I have too many commitments or things I need to do, balancing work / chores / relationships / etc. It might be that a few small things at home that are within your control might free up some space to reduce his stress levels. If he isn't in a space to do that kind of checking in (I certainly wasn't at his age!) maybe a small trip or holiday to let his nervous system have a bit of a break ? 

Do remember as well; he's still in there, and still a person, that person that you clearly adore! My parents struggled to understand what was going on and totally disconnected, and treated me like I was an entirely different person, which really hurt! I see PTSD as an addition to my personality, amplifying certain responses but I have always been 'in here' still. Gentle, curious and compassionate enquiry into what's going on for him (not suggesting you're not doing this but) might be a good place to start.

"Thank you so much for your vulnerability in sharing your personal experiences.  Reading ""he is still in there""  has me in literal tears. He asked us months ago to not give up on him and we will not. The last 8 months, he has given us a puzzle piece at a time and it's taken some time for us to make sense of what's going on.  While we don't have all the pieces, we can see the main parts.  It's incredibly difficult to see the internal struggle and pain that he is in and it's hard as a parent to not have a magic wand to make it all just go away.  I'd take it on myself if I could.

"Throwaway account, I’m writing this because I need to vent and don’t know what to do anymore.  
I ran way from home when I was 15, that was now 10 years ago. My childhood was difficult, I was abused and ended up with many mental health issues because of it. Including serious memory problems — I blocked out most of my preteen years. Some time after I ran away I started going to therapy frequently to try to improve my life.  
  
It’s hard to talk about this so forgive me for the bad writing. Most of the moments I couldn’t remember involved a male family member. For years I’d get nightmares of him. I had some memories that were completely blurry but still brought clear feelings of fear, revolt, disgust… Yet I never saw anything certain. It used to drive me mad that I still felt so much fear when I saw a picture of him while I couldn’t understand that feeling itself.  
To this day I still struggle a lot with being touched by others in any setting. I can’t keep relationships cause I don’t feel comfortable having sex until I’ve known someone for months. And still then, I’ll struggle with it. I’ve tried getting a wax so many times but always end up having a panic attack. I hate being hugged. I cry at appointments with my gynecologist. The impact this all has had in my life seems ridiculous sometimes.  
  
My parents had convinced most of our family that I hate everyone and I was “born evil” with the intention of breaking the family apart. We aren’t super religious but we were all taught from a very young age to never talk about home situations with others and that family members are the only people we can trust, ect...  

I’ve tried to maintain contact because of my younger siblings who are still there. I’m scared of what they might be going through. Unfortunately I wasn’t very successful and we haven’t actually talked in all this time, my siblings are still quite young and they don’t remember everything that happened when I lived with them. So when I did see them, they seem uncomfortable and unsure of how to treat me.  

Anyway…  
Couple years ago I was invited to a family reunion. I was surprised but went to get the chance to see my siblings again. Some people weren’t happy I was there and tried to physically kick me out. I came face to face with him as he was pushing me and got scared. I ended up blurting out “I came to make sure you aren’t doing it[molestation] to my siblings too”.  
I said it without thinking and I’ve cried many times thinking about this day. I didn’t have any proof that anything happened. But for years it was the only explanation I found for everything I felt.  
Nobody believed me of course. Now the whole family hates me and believe what my parents said about me being evil. My siblings looked disappointed and sad.  
  
This year I’ve been going to a specialist in hypnotherapy. After many sessions, as it turns out nothing actually happened to me. There was suggestive behavior like spying and weird looks and touches, he played with my mind a lot, manipulated me but nothing physical actually happened.  
The explanation I was given is that my fear of it happening probably took over and became this big monster looming over me; but it was just that. Just my own fear.  
  
Now I feel so lost. And angry and disgusting and guilty. I still feel the same way I did before, I still struggle with all those things, still get the nightmares. But I’m disgusted and angry with myself. I made my own life miserable because I was too weak to work through his manipulations and recover from my fear of him. Then I not only verbally, publicly accused someone without being certain(even if he’s a piece of shit), but I also took spaces that weren’t mine to take. I’ve been to therapists that specialized in sexual assault and also group therapy sessions with limited seats available. I hate myself so much for this."

"I personally wouldn't dismiss something happening based on memories from hypnotherapy. While those memories could be real, they aren't the whole story. I hope that your therapist isn't pushing you to believe there was nothing more. Often memories like the ones you describe are precursors to remembering the true abuse.

The bottom line is people don't fall apart for no reason. There are a lot of factors at play but if you are struggling then there is a valid reason for it.

You family is showing some really big red flags as well. Families who feel the need to demonize a child are hiding something that they don't want others to know about. Children younger than 15 are almost purely a product of their environment. If you were troubled as a child, there was something going on that caused that. Your family's behavior suggests they know what it is and are hiding it.

Please don't dismiss your concerns and give your family a free pass in their toxic behavior. It might help to look up narcissistic family dynamics. A lot of unhealthy families have a ""golden child"" and a ""scapegoat."" The golden child can do no wrong and the scapegoat can do no right. It's possible that you were the scapegoat in your family and a lot of the guilt piled on you is totally unwarranted.

I hope you also continue to seek care. Support groups can be a big help because interacting with others who have been through similar things can help you see things that therapists don't necessarily notice.

I hope the best for you. 🧡🧡🧡"	TAhypnose	reply	na	na	na	0.9826287031173706	no	no	no	na	ptsd	failed
I say trust yourself—and your nightmares and many other symptoms and your urgency to protect your siblings—over your family or therapists. Also look into CPTSD as the younger you were when the CSA was happening the less likely you are to have regular visual memories and more likely to experience emotional and somatic flashback-type recall. Pete Walker’s Complex PTSD book and The Body Keeps the Score book are both excellent. Hypnotherapy didn’t work for me to try to recall memories from when I was 4-5, though later on my abduction and molestation was confirmed by one of the perps. I’m sorry your family life was so awful that you had to flee it so young, and wish you all the best now and in the future.	TAhypnose	reply	na	na	na	0.9826287031173706	no	no	no	na	ptsd	failed
"Honestly, you were speaking from the heart. If it's true or not you were trying to do what was right so don't be too hard on yourself. Also, it's common to have been abused in someway and feel like you have to describe it as more extreme to match the emotions and sympathy you need. I used to exaggerate how long my abuse lasted because I really feared the whole ""thats it, you can't just get over it"" reaction even though no one ever said that to me.

"Just to be clear, I have no personal memory of rape ever occurring in my life but then again I have lots of strange behaviors that point to something occurring. Also I do have ptsd but from unrelated circumstances 

First of all I have a fear of men and my brain goes into overdrive when a man us within 6 feet of me, it makes me feel like I can't talk or think and I subconsciously am thinking what I would do if they were to attack me

My grandma hinted to me that she believed my father was ""doing inappropriate things to me"" when I was little and I was alone with him. 

In play I exhibited sexyal themes nearly constantly. Before I learned better I would display sexual themes between dolls and with other kids my age in talk and play. The play even sometimes had themes of unconsentual sex as young as 7-8 years old. (Not unconsentual play with other kids but ex. If we were playing barbies the doll might be being taken advantage of) 

I sexualized myself at a young age. I would often share explicit pictures with other men online. Sometimes I did it myself, other times I was pressured into it by creeps. 

I need male validation more than more people. I get this by talking with much older men and sexualizing myself just so I feel worthy (sometimes having sexual relationships with men well over 20-40 years older than me at the time. (11-15) 

I'm weirdly sexually active to the point where I masterbate multiple times per day and need to do it to sleep. 

Feeling uncomfortable around my father and having weird thoughts about him taking advantage of me despite having no active memories of this ever occurring. 

I was also afraid of  my dad when I was younger and I remember hiding from him after getting punished. 

A childhood enemy had told me that my father molestation him and insisted on it. I didn't belive them at first because they hate me bit now I'm starting to worry. 

That's all I can think of now (it's three in the morning) Ive stayed in the dark about this anxiety and weird feelings i have because i dont want to offend anyone or make a fool of myself.but I would apritiate if anyone else would share if they have gone through simular things and if this is something to look into.

You sound basically exactly like me. I was abused as a child sexually, apparently (how it happened I don't know, someone told me but I didn't press for details because I was too afraid), I started engaging in sexual behaviors around age 6-9 (my memory around this age is not good). And by 14, I was full blown acting out sexually with men who took advantage of me, even knowing my age. Somewhere along the line I equated that to real love, and started to engage in these behaviors as a form of self harm. I'm in therapy for it now.

"If you are anything like me,  my mum had a proclivity for pedophiles.  Had them around me as a baby. On one of my social services records,  a housing officer noticed a particular man coming in and out of my house.  He was a convicted pedo. He raped my mum infront of me when I was 4. He also used to bathe me. 

I exhibited this same behaviour as a child.  I didn't have risky sex ect though.  If anything,  it's made me afraid to enjoy sex.

"The sexual themes with toys/play/with friends thing...is that a sign? 

I did that and have this fear that there's something I'm not remembering. I'm also uncomfortable around my father, like hugging him etc feels sexual (not aroused, just weirded out by it). He potty trained me even though my mother didn't work (he worked full time). I've caught him looking at my breasts (clothed). He even caught my eye once and then looked back at them. 

When I was a kid I wanted to play mommies and daddies with my friends. With one male friend we did lie on top of each other, genitals touching but didn't know what went where. I can't remember how old I was was but based on the friend and school years I would have known him, I was 7 or under. 

I have a different relationship to sex than you do, I could take it or leave it but when I do have sex I don't say no to things I don't want to do. And the one time I did say no to something, he did it anyway but at the time we laughed it off. It wasn't until days later that I realised that wasn't ok. I can't orgasm with other people and I'm pretty sure I dissociate but I haven't slept with anyone since learning about dissociation. 

When I started therapy I shared that I was scared there was something I couldn't remember and have been thinking recently if it's sexual abuse. But I don't know what's normal kid exploring behaviour and what's signs of abuse behaviour and I'm too scared to talk to my therapist in case it is."

"This makes me think about a girl when I was ~8 who was the daughter of my moms friend.  This girl was my same age.  Every time she would come over, she would take me into a closet to “play doctor”.  I think I’ve blocked out exactly what happened, but I remember it involving a lot of sexual contact that she initiated.  Given my strong preferences  as an adult, there was almost certainly some oral sex.

When I told my wife about it, she immediately felt that the girl had been subject to sexual abuse, something that had not crossed my mind at all.

"My therapist likes to say that feelings are always okay. No exceptions. What's sometimes problematic are actions you take because of the feelings.

You didn't do anything to that person. You didn't make your anger his problem. That means you didn't do anything wrong.

It can be hard to separate feelings and actions sometimes. Especially with negative emotions like anger. But at the end of the day, you have every right to be angry for any reason at all. No matter how unreasonable. As long as your *actions* are reasonable, you yourself are being reasonable.

Trauma isn't rational and it's unrealistic to expect to never have irrational responses to it. Just comes with the territory.

"Like u/Karaethon22, you were triggered.

Triggers make us *feel* crazy, because they engage the same hormonal responses we experienced during the trauma(s).  So while it *feels* like the trauma is happening again, we know it didn't, during the trigger or a little later on.  It can make us feel like we're losing our minds, but we're not.  

Then, ...there's a ""coming down"" from those hormones.  You're not crazy, feeling bad about it is normal, and you're not alone.  It's a predictable symptom of PTSD.

It's such a struggle to be triggered at what seems to be random and at the whim of everyone/everything else. I'm pretty tired now but I've been talking to my friend about it. I feel better but not great. In the moment it was almost like vertigo sensation, where it made me dizzy for a few seconds when I saw that stranger. I'm trying not to feel ashamed for feeling so angry (in my head).	_SemperCuriosus_	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9943652153015137	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
Something I didn’t mention in my post was my anger once I got to my car. First I was so dazed that I almost forgot to finish paying for my groceries. Then there were two cars that were being stupid so I screamed at them. I was in my car far enough away but the anger I felt in the store came out.	_SemperCuriosus_	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9943652153015137	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"Hi, so 2 days ago something accidentaly triggered my Trauma.

Since then my brain tries to do anything to get me away from the danger which (luckily) doesn't really exist. Which means that it pretty much tries to shut on and off pretty much every emotion i have which is doing the exact opposit than helping me and only making it worse. And because that danger that it sees doesn't really exist it doesn't really find something that helps and tries new things and that throws me back in my healing journey.

I tried things that usually would help but it doesn't work and now i'm just extremely exhausted and don't know what to do anymore. Does somebody have advices what to do?

I sadly don't have therapy (hopefully that changes in the near future...)

(for information: The trauma is mostly about abandonment, trust, loneliness and fake friends during my early childhood (there's more but i can't remember most of my childhood so idk what else for sure). My tries till now (which helped most times) were talking with my friends and all that stuff, but it doesn't work good enough this time)

Sorry for the long text. Any advice is heavily appreciated!"	ClaimTV	post	14.832837326798622	male	White	0.9987439513206482	na	na	na	1	ptsd	failed

I’ve been in therapy for 1.5 years. The first 6 months was stabilizing/grounding after a year of complete dissociation. Then I started trauma therapy, was officially diagnosed with PTSD, and have started EMDR. I don’t know if it is the awareness of what my brain is doing because of my PTSD or if it is the contrast of feeling everything after feeling nothing, but I feel absolutely certifiably crazy. The more I learn about myself and this disorder, the more overwhelmed I become. Does anyone else have similar experience or any words of wisdom? I’ve been really struggling recently.	allison0214	post	25.157707762613512	female	White	0.9960224032402039	na	na	na	15	ptsd	failed
"It gets worse before it gets better. I've been at it for years now. It takes time and a ton of work to get out of the hole. As you make progress, more things will come up, and you'll work through them. It's has ups and downs, as you get better, the downs get shorter and less frequent.

You need to establish a routine for yourself so you can find a way to unpack/visit your trauma when it’s safe and a way to store it away when you need to.

"I find I do worse if I am not looking after myself. But I have known I have had it for a long time and originally I didn't really have any symptoms until I got a bit older and realised I had it. I think your mind plays into the symptoms in a way. If you don't have one and you hear about it, your mind might start playing to that symptom. Because our minds are just that strong.   


I have to basically be on top of my shit everyday to keep it at bay. Meditation, exercise, yoga, working, art/music and eating right.

Yes! I was doing CBT and DBT for a year with no changes - for better or worse. The general attitude was that the symptoms will never go away, I just need to learn how to manage them, and avoidance was a big part of that. I thought there was something unfixable about me bc I struggled so hard in developing the recommended routines and healthy habits. In March I started working with a trauma specialist.  She explained to me that I never stood a chance with some of the expected routines, especially meditation, which can actually be harmful in my condition. We’ve attacked my traumas head on and even discovered some new ones that I didn’t know were affecting me.  Everything is a mess right now and I am much more symptomatic, but I have a new found hope that I will get through this and I will get better. Try talking to your therapist about containment exercises. Mine has a specific script she reads me about carefully and respectfully putting the painful parts into an imaginary little box (or a big box if needed) not to be ignored but to be addressed when I’m ready.

Well, it’s different for everyone. Normally you can figure that out with a therapist but basically you just have to be able to teach yourself how not to go into flight or fight constantly all day so you can function and other people don’t freak out by your trauma responses too.

"OK so before I get into this, I live with my PTSD relatively peacefully. I'm very happy, healthy and I'm some fairly major ways my experiences and PTSD have actually benefited me including a book published and a successful career in mental health. I'm incredibly lucky in that regard and I know many people struggle much more than me. 

However I had very dark days in the mid 2010s where things were really. These says I still have anxiety symptoms & episodes at times but nothing like before. 

Next week we're going on a family holiday with extended family for my wife's birthday. 9 adults and 2 toddlers. 

The seaside town we're going to is small, tight streets and nowhere to escape to. It turns out that it's holding a boating regetta that includes 10s of thousands of people and fireworks. Both major issues for me. 

I'm going prepared with ear plugs, noise cancelling headphones, beta blockers and benzos but even the thought of being there now is causing the anxiety to spike. 

I want to give my wife an amazing birthday and be present literally and metaphorically but I can just see a full week of disassociation and episodes. 

The family are all supportive (some don't really understand but they're polite about it) but I suspect the week ahead could be my hardest for years."	chalky87	post	27.572322811938896	male	White	0.9962472319602966	na	na	na	1	ptsd	no prediction.
"If you have any healthy coping mechanisms you already use then keep them up. Maybe make some time to meditate a few times a day to clear your mind and bring you back into your body. Say mantras in your head when you feel overwhelmed by the crowds or noise like “I’m safe, everything is ok”. Hold your wives hand during those times, I think the touch would be comforting.

My trigger is abuse, violence and yelling so thankfully I don’t face it much in day to day life, but I was recently working at an event where some of the men started fighting and yelling. I was there entertaining the kids so I just focussed on the kids and took them into another room and made sure they were safe. Then we played games and sung songs so they didn’t really notice what was happening. Distracting the kids actually helped to distract me too. So maybe you could focus on the two toddlers you mentioned, watch what they are doing, play with them, and comfort them if they seem scared by the fireworks or crowds. It might help to keep you in the present moment."	chalky87	reply	na	na	na	0.9962472319602966	no	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
My birthgiver(i hate calling her mom she doesn’t act like one) has given my alot of trauma and trust issues and a plethora of shitty feelings and memories. But specifically her punishments by taking the things I enjoyed away from me. I know thst it a common punishment but i was a very sad lonely depressed and suicidal all throughout my childhood so when i would get the couple of things that actually bring me joy taken away it was traumatic. Now as a teen/young adult I keep everything to myself. Also because I dont trust her at all and I dont think she deserves to know me after all the things she has done and put me through. Ive recently started dating have a bf. I decided to casually tell my moms as i always  have to say where and who im going out with. Usually i lie but i decided to just say im going out with insert name of my bf . I said he was just a friend though. I kiss my bf whenever i am not with him so i was excited to see him all day then after telling my mom and going out to see him i suddenly felt a loss of interest and feelings. Now i think because of my issues with my mom and now her knowing about him she will somhow take it away or use it against me and ruin it so i lost feelings on my own first??

Little tip, you don't have to tell your parents ANYTHING. They didn't even tell their parents much about what they were up to, but because of phones today were expected to be contactable at all times, which isn't normal. Your mom isn't your friend it seems so maybe keep some duller inoffensive memories of your day to tell her about in conversation instead, like schoolwork or something mundane. It'll also keep you out of trouble because she can't use your experiences against you, just be careful because once you keep your interests a secret, your problems become secret too. So once you start keeping things to yourself they really are your problems and your mom can't help with anything, so stay safe.

"I can empathize a ton with where you are- I got really lucky with the therapist I found who let me move at my own pace and let me define my goals. I was in crisis when I first went to her, and I’ll always remember how the first thing I told her was that I had medical trauma and claustrophobia, so she immediately offered to keep the door open and rearrange the office to whatever I needed, without asking ANYTHING else. The very first thing that we ever did together was establishing that I was safe. That my boundaries were respected. That I could ask for help.

That’s how therapy should feel.

It took almost a year of therapy before I decided I wanted to open the boxes. I actually learned about trauma specific therapy from her because she recommended I work through something called the Anxiety and Phobias workbook because she’s not a trauma specialist. She also recommended the CPTSD workbook because they’re designed to be worked on alone OR with a therapist. There was a really insightful and helpful chapter in the Anxiety and Phobias workbook that specifically discussed how trauma therapy works and what happens in the nervous system. It really, really changed things for the better for me to understand why my brain kept putting things into boxes, and why it was so painful to open them up again. 

We basically worked together as I went through the workbook, where she taught me the coping skills to weather my distress when I opened my boxes and process the experiences on my own. I would come to her when I was ready to talk about things or if the skills she’d taught me weren’t enough.

Trauma therapy is NOT the same as just general therapy - it’s a specialization. The person you saw should not have pressured you that way. A good therapist will help you first get to a place where you are not terrified to open the boxes. Then, they will be with you as you open your own boxes at your own pace.

You might decide to never open them, and that’s okay. **It’s your life and this is your choice.**

I hope you can find a therapist who knows how to give you the support and space for things to get better. I am wishing you all the best.

"It's entirely up to you whether or not you want to 'unbox' that stuff.

I did the same as you, just not with any kind of visualizations.  I just took all that shit that happened to me and just stuffed it away and I don't think about it.

I'm 50 now.  Most days are okay.  I essentially had a second 'birth' at around 20 where I basically just divorced myself from my childhood and just started over with a new me.  So to speak.  

Therapists are always about trying to get me to talk about stuff, but the ground gets really shaky and I freak out when I think about it, so I don't.  

I can function just fine without unboxing a bunch of shit that happened 40 years ago.  

So, it's up to you.  Don't let therapists bully you into doing it if you don't feel up to it.  

Basically, it's fine to let the past stay in the past and focus on the now and the future."	Ok_Green_1966	reply	na	na	na	0.9969733953475952	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	'no prediction.'

It sounds like you haven’t found the right therapist yet? Someone that can be gentle and patient and give you plenty of support and tools to prepare you first? The good news is it didn’t kill you when it was actually happening to you as a defenseless child (who was smart enough to box it up and hide it away) so it’s much less likely to kill you now as an adult with a powerful ally. As someone in my 60s that’s being compelled yet again to face my early traumas I can guarantee you that there’s no getting over it without going through it. And that the chronic stress you’re feeling by suppressing it will continue to impact your life and health until it’s resolved.  I’m currently doing psychedelic therapy and am a few weeks into Internal Family Systems therapy and have already managed to release major amounts of fear and stress from my body just by going back to my inner child to comfort her and tell her she’s safe now because adult me is 100% committed to loving and protecting her now and forever more. What I learned is that it was the resistance to facing my fears that was causing most of my pain (including two autoimmune disorders, an eating disorder, IBS, and 55+ years of major depression, social anxiety and aloneness) even more than the traumas themselves. But only you get to determine when you’re ready. I wish you all the best in your healing journey and hope you find peace soon. 💔❤️‍🩹❤️❤️❤️	Ok_Green_1966	reply	na	na	na	0.9969733953475952	weak	no	strong	na	ptsd	'ethnicity: no prediction, age: 60s, gender: female, explanation: the author self-identifies as a woman in her 60s dealing with therapy and trauma. ethnicity can't be accurately predicted from the given text.'

I have triggers that if I had better control over would improve my life. Any yelling, displays of anger etc will shut me down. I’ll isolate myself until I can speak. I have a very soft voice and people have difficulty hearing me sometimes. I’m unable to raise my voice and speak louder without great effort. I move around silently and startled people all the time because they didn’t hear me come in. I’m an expert in being invisible. I have a deep rooted belief that no one other than my children has ever loved me and that no one ever will. I don’t feel depressed over these things. I’m a happy person who enjoys my life but I’ve never really felt like I’m a normal person. I’ve never felt suicidal but I’ve never been afraid of dying. I know my entire life has been a shit show. I get up every day with a positive attitude and a belief that my luck will eventually change. I tell myself that crap happens every day to everyone, no need to hold on to yesterday’s turds. Every day is a fresh start. I know I’m messed up and it can’t be undone. All I can do is try and make the best of today and every day going forward.

"Ones that have been recommended to me by therapists:

- [How to keep house while drowning](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/How-to-Keep-House-While-Drowning/KC-Davis/9781668002841): while this book is specifically about… keeping a house clean… it gets recommended to me by EVERYONE because it really focuses on taking care of yourself and finding ways to accomplish your goals in ways that work for you - even if it’s not the way you “should” do something. It’s a great thing to have in place while doing some heavy healing

Now, onward: 

- [CPTSD workbook](https://www.amazon.com/Complex-PTSD-Workbook-Mind-Body-Regaining/dp/1623158249/ref=pd_aw_fbt_img_sccl_1/144-2337652-8278946?pd_rd_w=RGwtu&content-id=amzn1.sym.1383228f-ab5d-4064-97d6-80297ffcccd8&pf_rd_p=1383228f-ab5d-4064-97d6-80297ffcccd8&pf_rd_r=NMMK6M52RTH8X6N9Z64T&pd_rd_wg=vCWaT&pd_rd_r=c5a8a8de-548a-4b57-8dc8-431c1b2bd9e7&pd_rd_i=1623158249&psc=1)

- [The anxiety and phobias workbook](https://www.amazon.com/Anxiety-Phobia-Workbook-Edmund-Bourne/dp/1684034833/ref=mp_s_a_1_2?crid=1182N6XC7MI9T&keywords=anxiety+and+phobia+workbook&qid=1691626510&sprefix=anxiery+and+pho%2Caps%2C166&sr=8-2)

- Dr Peter Levine’s [books](https://www.somaticexperiencing.com/se-books), but waking the Tiger was specifically recommended to me as an alternative to the Body Keeps the Score.

- I do NOT recommend the body keeps the score by Bessel van der Kolk because he was fired from the foundation he created and sued for inappropriate behavior and creating a hostile work environment. It will show up a lot in any reading lists or searches about PTSD and trauma recovery, but the controversy about him is not commonly known and really makes some off putting things in his writing even worse.

There are more books in this subject area, which is something called **somatic experiencing**. it’s an approach that digs into understanding how to experience and process a visceral reaction to a trigger or a threatening experience without adding new boxes. It’s very much about empowerment, even though it can be hard at times. After learning how to do it, the idea is to feel confident and prepared to start opening the trauma boxes, because as you do, your ability to navigate the experience grows and the actual visceral reaction is supposed to become less and less overwhelming and extreme. that has been my experience. 

I’m coming out of the worst PTSD regression I’ve experienced in 15 years. It’s sucked, but it’s been like night and day compared to what my day to day life was like post trauma and pre therapy.

The last recommendation I have not been brave enough to read. I know it’ll open a VERY big box of memories for me, but:

- [adult children of emotionally immature parents](https://www.amazon.com/Adult-Children-Emotionally-Immature-Parents/dp/1626251703)

Wishing you the best in this exploration.

Edit: I think also these books kind of support trauma therapy techniques like to EMDR, which is a trauma light therapy technique to help the brain physiologically change and improve symptoms. That chapter in the anxiety workbook really digs into the other available techniques and medications, they weren’t available to me, and I got lucky that talk therapy and exposure was sufficient for me."

Thank you, I can’t change whatever happened. I don’t believe that reliving it will help me grow emotionally. I believe that was then and this is now. I don’t care really care if I don’t mature. I have been seeking therapy because I need to understand people better and how to know when someone is using my emotions to manipulate me. My ex did this to me. Would reward me emotionally when I acted like he wanted me to and would act mad or mean to me if I didn’t and I would cry and give in so he wouldn’t be mad at me. I eventually saw the pattern and didn’t care if he was mad and would make him madder even though I knew it wasn’t right lol. I just need to know how to protect myself as I am.

"Trigger Warning 

A year ago, I was assaulted by someone I trusted very much. Since then, I have developed PTSD and have lost so much of my memory. I ended a three year long relationship just a few months before the incident. Three years and I can only see his face in photos and videos. No memories of just the two of us. He was my first love, first everything, and I don’t even remember why we broke up. It’s all in bits and pieces.

 I was hesitant to reach out before, because I knew his girlfriend wanted nothing to do with me, which is fair. Now, with nothing stopping me, i’m not sure what to do. 

I don’t want to dredge up the past, but I just don’t know how to handle all the holes in my memory."	Leather_Hawk_4985	post	26.79844612137693	male	White	0.9969862103462219	na	na	na	4	ptsd	no prediction.

"The main risk I can think of is if you broke up non-amicably for very good reasons. Like, for example, you noticed he was becoming abusive and then when you reach out and say you forgot so much he’s perfectly set up to gaslight you. Or he just rewrites your history to make himself look better and you believe his lies.

If you two were going to transition from exes to friends you probably would’ve done that already.

I was a correctional officer for 6 years. Even made it to Sergeant. That all changed in April of this year. I was seriously assaulted for the 3rd time in the last 2 years while trying to conduct a cell search. Ever since this assault I've been having nightmares where I'm screaming in my sleep. I have extreme anxiety around large crowds of people. I have flashbacks to the event frequently. I find it hard to even function normally most days. I guess I'm saying all this to see if there are any other current or former COs or even other LEOs in here I could talk to who deal with this stuff too.

I knew/was dating my partner for almost exactly 2 months when my accident happened and it completely changed everything. We have had to navigate this new relationship while I also sort out my trauma and PTSD and it has been really hard.

I’d say the biggest issue I have is that it’s changed my attachment style significantly. I’m so much more anxiously attached and emotionally heightened/hyper vigilant than I used to be. I’m worried that my trauma makes me unloveable and I look for anything that could possibly remotely resemble him distancing himself or becoming disinterested or his feelings changing about me for the worse for whatever reason.

I can’t really socialize in the same way or for as long as I used to be able to, sometimes I think that’s because I can’t relate to other people in the same way anymore. It also causes an issue between us when he tries to compare something that has happened in his life to what happened to me, because it always highlights how little he understands which is scary and unsettling to me. How can I be in a relationship with someone who brings up tearing a ligament in his knee playing soccer in high school when we’re talking about a car accident where somebody died that totally changed my entire life? How can this work? But it’s not his fault - he’s trying to have empathy and relate out of love and compassion and just using what he knows. It’s not physically or literally possible for him to understand but that doesn’t mean we can’t be together.

PTSD can make your nervous system totally shot or overloaded or even in some cases I think unresponsive and actually changes the way your brain works, which can affect your thoughts and behaviors and make dating really hard."

"I date both monogamously and polyamorously, and there’s a great book called Polysecure which focuses on attachment theory in more than just a traditional romantic relationship. It also made me realize how significantly trauma influenced my friendships too.

I think it’s a good read for everyone because it goes in deep about how trauma and attachment issues _outside_ of the relationship can manifest in destructive behaviors and tension inside the relationship. 

Therapy has helped a ton, but I still struggle with a sense of foreshortened future.. and it’s really hard to progress a relationship if I YOLO every day and assume abandonment… someday.

We recently got through a trauma and a major regression for me. So, my partner got a crash course in how the worst of my symptoms manifest. I go nonverbal. Have incredibly volatile reactions going from sobbing to laughing or just… nothing. He did ok. 

I feel safe and trust people who don’t coddle me and tell me the truth, firmly if necessary. And he would tell me when I had crossed the line between “self care/coping”(sleeping in) and moving through “impulsive decision making”(went on a lot of trips) all the way to “concerningly self destructive”(almost quit my job/stopped eating). Sometimes I need someone to tell me “HEY THATS A TERRIBLE IDEA” instead of “do what you need to feel better/safe!”

Neither of us were our best, but we know how to do better next time.

"I'm diagnosed with both ADHD and PTSD. I'm prescribed Adderall, but I feel as if it's not made much of a difference in regards to my attention/focus. I feel it does to a degree, but not as much as I'd hoped 

I'm worried this focus problem is more to do with my ""broken"" brain due to PTSD, which I don't think is really treatable with any sort of medication. 

Is there any way to tell for sure? Are there any good methods to help increase focus and memory with PTSD?"	smilessmalls	post	48.65910124334266	male	White	0.9929047226905823	na	na	na	3	ptsd	failed
"I'm in a similar boat to you. I'll only share my experience with you to throw an idea out there, not trying to suggest I have the right answer.

When I was diagnosed with PTSD I told the psych that I also have ADHD so he prescribed me Wellbutrin. He was telehealth so he couldn't prescribe me Adderall. After being on the Wellbutrin for a while, I noticed that I had a lot less flashbacks and that my mood was much better. However, when I would sit down to do something....I couldn't do it. I would feel like I had all the energy in the world, feeling good about myself, no distracting flashbacks or other negative mood. Sit down to work....nothing. And that's when I knew I needed to be medicated for my ADHD as well.

I sought out help for my ADHD and started on the Adderall late last year. I can't tell you how much better I can function being on both Wellbutrin and the Adderall. The Wellbutrin helps with my anxiety, flashbacks, and depression. Adderall helps with decision making, energy, and being able to choose what to focus on more easily. Both of them help me regulate my mood better.

TLDR: If you're treating your ADHD and not your PTSD you might not see a huge improvement. Also if you literally just started on Adderall, hopefully they started you on a low dose and slowly work your way up. It's possible on the lower dose you might not notice much, but over time you might. And just for the sake of clarification, I'm not suggesting you start Wellbutrin, I'm just saying that you might want to look into treating your PTSD with something along with your ADHD.

Sorry if that was a little long winded. Hope you find what helps you!"	smilessmalls	reply	na	na	na	0.9929047226905823	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
"No I don't think you can really fix ptsd much with needs at all, although you can obviously regulate your mood. But generally, ptsd needs working on cognitive and emotional schemas. 

Meds aren't a magic bullet for ADHD either. It's definitely helpful, but I still have ADHD when on them. I find that they really help a lot in combination with routine and environmental adjustments, but if I take them and just sit down on the couch, they don't do much at all.

All that said, I don't think any behaviour is just ptsd or just adhd, or not any of them. You have ptsd and adhd all the time, they impact how your brain functions and will be a factor in everything you do. But so is your personality and everything else in your brain, so it's never just those diagnoses either."	smilessmalls	reply	na	na	na	0.9929047226905823	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

"No, probably not. 

I think a lot about what it would take to heal my trauma in a way that offered lasting benefits. I've studied psychedelic drugs for a long time too and understand their applications too. 

I've gone through cycles introduced by trauma and traumatic events that have affected my mood as opposed to something like bipolar. My general mood has actually been consistent throughout, believe it or not. It's interesting because my mood has been somewhat consistent (only difference being that I'm wayyy more anxious and more difficulties focusing because of consistent trauma) and I suspect that has made others believe that the story of my trauma is less credible. 

But forgetting my trauma wouldn't help me and I believe it's because I also learned from my trauma too. Now, don't get the DeSantis ""slavery wasn't that bad"" vibe from that comment -- it means that we have a tendency to view events in binary terms but during the most traumatic events I survived, there were moments where I was happy or laughed or found temporary moments or enjoyment. Our emotional states seem to constantly try to find stasis so even in my trauma, as I contemplated why, I also learned a lot about myself and others. I don't want to forget that. 

In therapy, I told my therapist that I often view my trauma as a relationship that I need to break up with. In the same way that I don't or wouldn't want to forget any of my ex's, good, bad, or indifferent, I wouldn't want to forget my trauma either. 

I also learned that I am resilient too. I'm not someone who is waiting to be screwed over again.

Right now, I'm too damn tired to objective this scenario. I grew up not having a lot, and not being given a lot. My parents were really sick people. I'm really tired and stressed lately.

"Coming from a family where there was abuse and poverty I would say that I have spending habits where I have issues with buying things just because  there cheap as well as overcluttering my spaces. I know this isn't really what you mean but I think when someone comes from I childhood where they didn't have alot, they tend to have a need to get more throughout deals and buying things just because there cheap.

"Not asking for medical advice. This happened a long time ago, I just want to figure out what happened.

Around the time my PTSD flared up, a couple times I would be in my bed about to doze off. Then, I would get the image of some ghastly ghoul (Linda Blair from the Exorcist, or Linda from the first Evil Dead), then a weird colour light show. It felt like I was sinking, and I had to fight to get out of it. I couldn't move at all until I came to, which I forced myself to do. 
Also, the thousand yard stare. I'd have times where I'd zone out and barely be in control of where my eyes were pointed, to humiliating results (found myself unintentionally staring at a girl, and got the middle finger). I'd still be conscious, but it kinda felt like my eyes had a mind of their own.

In case anyone is curious, I was heavily abused by my homicidal, sociopathic, narcissistic older brother for eight years, I was ages 5 to 14. He tried to kill me many times. I'd have nightmares of him succeeding in one of his many murder attempts, and one where he manipulated my 13 year old little brother into killing himself (he did threatened to kill the whole family)."

Ĺast night i was laying in bed when my other came and hugged me, they literally only put there arm on me and kissed my check like they always do, and I started to feel so weird, even tho this is very typical part of us sleeping (we cuddle) I was having flash backs everytine he touched me or I was feeling as if he was harming me. I know he never would and as soon as I asked him to stop he stopped and told me he respected my boundaries and when I was ready to be cuddled to let him know. I feel so guilty cuz I know he hasn't done anything wrong. I'm not sure if this is a normal feeling with ptsd?, he looks nothing like the person (s) whom disrespected me, he doesn't sound like them and he's been the only person I've ever been comfortable around.. but yesterday he became them in my mind.

My SO and I were playfighting the other day and he noticed my posture changed, he backed off before I even knew what was happening.

"Yeah 100%. I have had all kinds of different versions of this. It's a very normal feeling with PTSD. If I'm set off enough I am really jumpy and hate to be touched. It can be like this really urgent ""get away from me, get your hands off of me, etc"" even with people I love and desire. It's not a rational choice or a conscious thought but a deep feeling of danger that comes from a deeper part of your nervous system. It's not something you need to feel guilty or ashamed about but a very real part of being traumatized.   


  
It sounds like you have a supportive and understanding partner and it's great that you're able to talk about it together. I understand the fear of losing them but you may find that talking about this stuff candidly and having it received can do a lot to enhance your feelings of safety and trust. Also makes a lot of sense for you to feel this way in anticipation of an uncomfortable and invasive medical procedure in a very intimate part of your body. It's important to keep that in mind and not just feel like it's going to be like this between the two of you forever (which, idk, I can definitely feel that way in an activated state sometimes)."

most of my trauma happened in my childhood and stuff so maybe that’s it but i just wanted to vent/ask if “weird” things like that also trigger others? i rarely get triggered or anything (only when people ask about my family or something). it was just a confusing experience cause at first i was unsure of why i was upset.

"Be prepared for feelings of guilt. “I should have done more. I should have done something. I should have done this… if I only did this one thing, that person wouldn’t be dead…” Unfortunately this is normal, and that guilt can be intense. Always remember, you did not kill that person. You just saw it happen. The guilt goes to the person that actually did kill them, not you. The sooner you accept this, the better off you’ll be. 

Be prepared for nightmares. They totally suck, especially when they turn into night terrors. Waking up screaming is never any fun. If that doesn’t happen, consider yourself lucky.

2. I try to remember the lives my friends would have wanted to live and do my best to honor them with my own life.
3. Finally, but far from least.  I turn to Jesus Christ.  Through Christ I have hope for the future and a purpose for the now.  That purpose, showing the same love, grace, and mercy to others that He first showed me.

I have reasons I don’t trust people. One moment your a kid playing with some kid in a pool having fun when he suddenly tries to drown you, and the next you are an adult who has been run into with cars, beat to hell, and had someone they love stab them for no reason-literally. I’ve been betrayed time and time again by those close to me and I find it better to shut down most of the time rather than engage with people. Obviously this is not healthy and something I am working on, and I realize, the joy of conversation has died inside me. And i smoked a few more joints and really took some time to remember a high lights reel of some of the best conversations I’ve ever had. And they were usually with someone random I happened to start talking to and was awesome. It’s how I used to make friends. And it amazed me how this huge integral part of me had just disappeared and was screaming for me to come and pull it out of hiding. And it is not perfect overnight, but I am slowly finding joy in conversation again. Trust may be another story, but it’s a start.

Generally a good therapist will agree outcomes with their client at the very start so everyone knows what the client is working towards and try to establish milestones as a measure of success and to adjust.

Also anti depressant medication is only designed to reduce symptoms to make life feel a little easier and therapy more accessible got a person. It's not a cure and shouldn't be leaned on. The only time someone should say to rely on the medications (and this is dependant on a lot of things) is if the client is in a really bad place mentally and not able to engage with the therapy.

Your therapist should be talking about things like your history (what happened), how it has affected you, why it affected you in accordance with your values, beliefs and what's important to you. Also things like triggers, coping strategies and various other aspects like family, relationships, work, quality of life if those things are impacted by your mental health concerns."

"I developed ptsd from an abusive relationship that ended in 2019. I still have nightmares, but they've been becoming more frequent over the last month or so, and I've had one every night for the last week now. 

The dreams always involve my ex being in my life, which they're not always necessarily nightmares where they actively scare me, but more so as if they were still in my life. And they're so vivid. I usually wake up confused and slightly anxious, but the scarier ones make me wake up in a panic hoping that I'm not actually living that life anymore, and that my current partner is the one next to me. 

It's just been impacting my sleep so much, constant waking up, sweating profusely, increased heart rate and trouble breathing; its already hard enough that I have sleep apnea and have to use a cpap every night, so having nightmares on top of that is so frustrating. I also typically rip the cpap off when I have these nightmares, which is even worse for me because then I'm not breathing well and I wake up to put it back on or wake up really tired if I don't.  

I just don't know what to do to remedy this other than therapy, which I cannot afford. I was on hydroxizine for sleep but it's no longer prescribed to me and it didn't really help in terms of nightmares, just made me knock out, which I didn't like because it made me feel *forced* to sleep. 

If anyone has the same problem, what do you do to help with these types of nightmares? I know there's probably no way of preventing them other than therapy, so even something to destress afterwards and put me back in my right mind would be great as a suggestion, as well. I've been meditating and exercising, but it only helps so much."	0versized-	post	17.426617080371418	male	White	0.9982333183288574	na	na	na	3	ptsd	failed

"This is something I did with the supervision and guidance of a therapist, so I don't know if it's something you should do solo but still wanted to tell you about it.


I don't know if this will work, I didn't read your dream to avoid triggers just in case so this may not be applicable.

She had me write down the dream, but change the ending or direction of how it went to how I wanted it to go. So the dream still happened but I rewrote it. 

I would read it and visualize the new dream and repeat it. If it was too intense she had me pretend I was watching it on a TV, or even a black and white TV. 

I had to do this over time and you will need to hold space for recovery and grounding after. 

The dream changed for me and eventually stopped.

"I'm so sorry you're going through that ): it's so frustrating just trying to get a normal night's sleep, I feel so envious of past me for being able to sleep so soundly when now I can't fall asleep until like 6 am most days and have such shit sleep, it feels almost not worth sleeping at all. I've tried anxiety medication, allergy meds, nyquill, and self medication with weed. Weed is the closest I've gotten to a somewhat good sleep, but it doesn't guarantee I won't have vivid nightmares, and I don't want to rely on it especially when it can cause me to be anxious half of the time. 

And yeah, I'm considering changing from the nose pillows to the face mask, but I have a really small face (I wear an xs) and have piercings, so I don't know how well that would work out, especially without insurance. The nose pillows slip off easily or annoy me when im having nightmares cause it will feel tight on my face, even when it's adjusted comfortably. 

I do feel your pain in taking it out on loved ones, I don't want to do it, but when you're irritable from lack of sleep and you're also suffering with a trauma response, it's incredibly hard and I always feel so awful afterwards. I've made a lot of progress, but the nightmares coming back after not having them frequently anymore has made it feel as if I undid years of progress. I know that's not true, and I know im safe now, but it's just really discouraging for me to have it pop up out of nowhere again. I just hope this goes away, not just for me, but for everyone who deals with ptsd in general. 

As much as I feel less alone dealing with this, among other disorders, it pains me greatly to know there's other suffering with this disorder.

"Hi all,

Knowing that PTSD can manifest differently in people, I was wondering how common it is to ‘forget’ your human needs (e.g., sleeping, drinking, eating). I will sometimes go 2-3 days without remembering to eat, unless prompted. I feel hunger pangs, but I feel no urge to act on them. Part of this is related to the source of my trauma: 16 years US Army, multiple combat tours, and being forced to learn to ignore your body’s ailments and pleas. I’m deliberately limiting the scope of this post to food, because I don’t think anything could help my sleep. 

I wish I could just ‘be hungry’ and eat at normal times like a regular person. I’m slim by American standards (5’8”, 160lbs/ 173cm, 73kg) so not eating becomes problematic pretty quick. In June, I almost had to goto the hospital after barely eating anything for a week. 

I am a medical cannabis user, and that does help. At times. Other times, I can smoke 3.5g in a day and not even get the munchies. My wife is great about making sure I eat, but if she’s not home, I don’t eat. We have plenty of food. I want to eat, but I don’t. And then the less I eat, the less I want to eat. Stomachs shrink, and next thing you know I’m getting full from half of a granola bar. 

Any thoughts?"	cheneyk	post	30.023183665596626	male	White	0.996218740940094	na	na	na	32	ptsd	'ethnicity: no prediction, age: 40s, gender: male, explanation: the author identifies himself as a veteran of the us army, which suggests that he is likely in his 40s or older, based on his mention of 16 years of service and multiple combat tours. he also refers to his wife, indicating that he is male. as for ethnicity, there is no specific information provided in the post to make an assumption.'

"I find myself not wanting to eat because of depression during/after a flare. I also find myself walking alot to calm my mind (and I have an active dog) so calories in and calories out is an important thing for me. As a person who's admittedly swayed by standard beauty ideals, not eating makes me thinner which is a reward in and of itself. I'm afraid of developing an eating disorder or just wasting away because of all of this, so I've developed some strategies to simplify eating when I'm apart from my husband so I'm on autopilot about it, which helps.

So, I eat mostly the same thing for breakfast and for lunch everyday and always at the same time. Cereal or energy drink for breakfast and fruit/yogurt and some kind of carb and protein for lunch (bread and Peanut butter or hummus or chicken or spring mix and croutons w/oil and vinegar dressing).  I've had good luck with protein drinks too if you have yourself a blender and some frozen fruit and nut butter, that makes a great part of a meal.

Very common issue among PTSD sufferers, myself included. Usually my digestion stops every night because my night terrors/sleep is so disturbed that when I wake after my digestive system being shut down all night I am not hungry. Often nauseated. As another user said just having the same staple items around for breakfast and lunch to get me through most of the day can be helpful. Recently even though I can feel my hunger pangs they aren’t registering as hunger and prompting me to eat so I just force a bite or 2 of food down so I don’t get a headache or pass out. I’ve also learned that when I am craving something or really wanting to eat something specific, even if it’s unhealthy and greasy, I just eat it anyway and will go out of my way to get whatever it is. For someone that has issues consistently eating, making sure I do get those guilt pleasure meals is important and often they are the largest meals I will eat.

Damn. This's the first time I've ever heard anyone talk about this topic and been able to completely relate to it. It's not deliberate starvation, but it's not completely accidental either. Just...automatic. You know?

I do it with food too. And sleep. Sometimes even bathroom breaks, if I'm not careful.

Not a veteran. Just got in the bad habit of ignoring needs, a while back.

It's helped me to drink my calories when I can. Protein shakes. They're faster and easier compared to preparing food, cooking, etc. You can get more intake when you're in the shrunk stomach zone after a few days, too.

Sometimes I just cram food into the meatsuit when I realize that empty-stomach nausea's started. I should probably go do that now tbh.

"I’m a medical user as well. Some strains I find don’t give me the munchies. I’m not sure if you grow your own or what you’ve tried in the market. Personally if I’m not smoking I’m not eating. Maybe try a few different strains and see if one makes you hungry, even if it doesn’t help other stuff. You can mix them 50/50. Other than that, pre made protein shakes or anything with a lot of nutrition in liquid form helps. Also taking probiotics with every meal to improve gut health does wonders and helps me with emotional stability in general. Abstaining from alcohol helps too for me.

Edit: sometimes I go through 7 grams in a day on top of 500mg of edibles to get through til tomorrow. And I don’t even feel high from it. I just can function.

"I recently saw a dietitian for this after hitting a major regression in my symptoms and 3 months after onset, still struggling to get an appetite.

She helped me come up with a progression to follow of building habits and slowly adding more food to my daily intake. At first it was one meal + four snacks, and I had to set an alarm then make myself eat when it went off.

After the week, I had hunger cues right before the alarm went off! The next step was two meals and two snacks. Ultimately I’m aiming for 3 meals and up to 3 snacks a day depending on how much exercise I’m getting. Im not there yet, but it’s been the first thing EVER to work for me.

Also, snacks feel so much more achievable than meals? An apple and peanut butter. Cheese and crackers. Avocado toast. A lunchable. And then a meal is just two snacks at the same time.

It's a struggle to have enough energy or interest in eating that I make a full meal. In the winter I eat a lot of soup. I make a pot, refrigerator some and freeze some.

"Also, fwiw, different strains of cannabis have different effects. One of the websites, Leafly iirc, has strain reviews that describe whether a strain is good for sleep or appetite or uplifting and energizing. I used to smoke that much, I use vapes now because I was getting black lung. Your dispensary vendor can usually help you find a strain that meets your specific medical needs. Loss of appetite in cancer and HIV patients was one of the more common reasons were was legalized for medical purposes. You have to be using a strain that works for appetite though. 
Eat small meals throughout the day, like eat more fruit and graze on healthy snacks. The other thing I recommend is a multivitamin. When you aren't able to eat enough to get sufficient nutrients supplements are important.
Lastly, I spend a lot of time reading recipes to get ideas and stimulate my appetite. I've learned a bunch of fast pasta recipes so when I have the energy to boil some pasta I don't have to rely on tomato sauce. Pasta has protein and you can throw cheese on it for calcium and protein. Rice is also pretty flexible and you can throw a fried egg on it for a meal.

"Thanks, you too! I’m not great at managing my episodes yet but I have gotten a lot better at knowing how they will play out. What throws me off is I can have a delayed reaction between when something happens and when the episode kicks in.

I was very resistant to accept this because I always thought of triggers as instant. I am a “power through it” person and could not understand why I immediately felt fine after something happened but then felt like shit for weeks after. So now if I know I’m going to be around certain people / places I do my best to prepare for not having control over that.

Thank you so much, yes I have prazosin (currently experimenting with being off of it for a couple days) as well as lots of indica edibles and whatnot. Always a guessing game how to tackle the sleep. But yes the food is tricky and I just try to give my body what it wants (if it wants anything) as soon as it is telling me.

"Control is one of the areas I’ve been working on.

Dogs are a lifesaver. Especially for people like me that don’t care to socialize anymore. I would rarely leave the house if they didn’t love walking with me.

"It depends on the situation. I am always uncomfortable with power imbalance. My job for example… if people treat me differently, or if I make a mistake, I start making an internal catastrophe out of it (as my therapist calls it) and worry I’ll get laid off, then lose my money, then lose my house, can’t pay bills, fast forward to dying sick and alone. In these situations I prepare myself by knowing what my negative thought patterns are. I’m working with my therapist to analyze my reactions / fixations and kind of re-wire my brain so that not every setback becomes a worst case scenario I have to prep for like dooms day. It’s like coming up with something to say to myself (that I actually believe) that frames the situation more practically. 

It also helps to create control… like if I know I’m going to be seeing an abusive family member I don’t need to stick around feeling trapped because there is no obligation to. I can just get up and leave.

"Yes - I'm so scared and disgusted by touch and physical intimacy due to the wrong people viewing me in an *inappropriate* sexual manner and/or touching me inappropriately and physical abuse as well

And it's in ways that nobody will ever be able to understand and yet I don't want to hurt or offend other people depending on the context so I just hug in a detached way with no emotion involved, with a huge gap in between myself and the other person, or will basically curve them in whatever way that I can

At the end of the day - you're not obligated to touch anyone that you don't want to touch and it's your body so you decide who is allowed to be within that space that surrounds you - you just have to clearly communicate boundaries both in terms of explicit and implicit (verbally and through body language)

You  can also choose how you hug the person, if you hug the person, and the space between yourself and the other person

However, with that being said - if it were up to me - then nobody would ever touch me and I would also never touch anyone

As for crowds - I love the energy of being in a crowd when it's in a different country because there's no commitment

Whereas I can't stand being in crowds when I'm at home because I want to protect my energy since you don't know who or what you'll encounter

I also don't like seeing a lot of people's ""energy"" in those spaces like clubs

Unfortunately - there are a lot of people with bad energy and it's easier to 'avoid' by not 'engaging' with people and things that aren't good for me

However, even then - I can't avoid it all the time like when I'm out walking or driving in the city where I live and due to the sheer number of people that I don't like, that don't like me, and that I don't feel safe around -- so I basically just create a shield or 'bubble' to protect myself - block out the negative people and energy by tuning them out - and keep moving forward"	Lilypad244	reply	na	na	na	0.9994462132453918	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

Hello! While I may not relate to these specifics, I do get incredibly antsy when on line, and if I feel physically “trapped” or snuck up on. Through education, I have found out these are symptoms of ADHD and PTSD. The things that have helped me are therapy, medication and just learning to be kind to myself - even the parts of me I wish I could eradicate, like jumping through the ceiling when someone surprises me. I always found the advice “thoughts are just thoughts” as potentially reductionist, but what I read in a book once that helped was that you cannot eradicate thoughts, but you can choose to not believe them. I think look into why this bothers you, and find ways to not believe those thoughts :) I know this is broad but I really hope it helps <3	Lilypad244	reply	na	na	na	0.9994462132453918	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"Greetings, fellow Redditors,
  

  
I hope this post finds you all in good health and spirits. As a lawyer, I wanted to share my journey and seek advice from this supportive community. Approximately 8 months ago, I found myself in a distressing situation, having been let go by a toxic manager and business owner. Today, I am grateful to have transitioned into a much healthier work environment with supportive colleagues and bosses.
  

  
I'm writing this post not only to vent out my feelings but also to reach out to those who might have faced similar challenges or have insights to share. My former workplace was marked by bullying and harassment from my manager/business owner, which led me to experience considerable emotional strain. While I studied PTSD during law school, I never fully comprehended its impact until I lived through it. Even now, 8 months later, I find myself grappling with debilitating flashbacks that manifest as breathing difficulties and other mental health issues.
  

  
Recent developments in my health, including a diagnosis of heart conditions, have led me to question whether the tumultuous environment of my previous workplace played a role. This post serves as an avenue for me to open up about my experiences and seek advice from individuals who may have insights on overcoming PTSD. I am fully aware that recovery is a gradual process, but any guidance would be greatly appreciated.
  

  
In the past, my old manager would engage in troubling behavior, such as exploiting candidates for free work under the guise of interviews and later mock their efforts. He would often belittle my colleagues and me, imposing unreasonable tasks like ordering breakfast and making his beverages, despite the demanding nature of our legal work. His micromanagement extended to scrutinizing every detail, leading to undue stress over minor issues. I vividly recall him saying he would shoot me if he had a gun—an absolutely horrifying experience that left me feeling trapped and fearful.
  

  
Regrettably, my experiences were further marred by his inappropriate comments and threats. His proclamations of connections and expertise contrasted sharply with his reality, as he frequently relied on others for solutions. Furthermore, he manipulated clients, seizing them from fellow lawyers and eventually mistreating them. The volatile nature of his behavior only intensified my struggle with PTSD.
  

  
Amidst this turmoil, I found solace in the fact that I now work in a supportive environment. However, the scars of my previous experiences continue to affect me. If anyone has navigated a similar path or has advice on how to cope with PTSD and regain emotional well-being, I would be incredibly grateful for your insights. Let's foster a space for healing, understanding, and sharing.
  

  
Thank you for taking the time to read my story and for being a part of this compassionate community.

I truly don't see it as pessimistic because there's nothing negative in my beliefs. I've been hurt a lot.

"Fully agree. Sometimes I feel this push to foster relationships and friendships, but then it just dissipates... I find something wrong, get bored, or I destroy it myself. I think it's more of a stable state to be in this type of mindset. I've recently stopped communicating with my best friends, exes and some family members. I found them initially to be so emotionally consuming or felt that I put more energy into it than I received. So around April i quit and took a complete step back. I do feel somewhat colder now and don't believe in second chances anymore. 

What's frustrating is that I'll hear from some of these friends, and then they state that they miss me because I was a true friends and there for them 24/7. But it shouldn't take significant measures to be appreciated.

It’s looking more and more like my tremors, tics, and “seizures” are non-epileptic. The stigma attached to this is something I’m not happy about dealing with, but even worse the treatments don’t really seem to be there. What treatment has worked for you for this? I’ve been referred to “talk therapy” like I wasn’t already in talk therapy and haven’t been in talk therapy for over a decade with different therapists and approaches along the way. I’ve done tons on CBT with different therapists, 20+ weeks of DBT, and I disassociate so badly I could not stay present in the room long enough to do even one EMDR session. I feel absolutely hopeless and like I’ve basically been given a death sentence because there’s no more treatments to pursue that I haven’t already tried. I am going to see if I can try ketamine or another round of TMS, but other than that I don’t know what else to do and I feel absolutely hopeless. I can’t work. I can’t function.

I had to do a lot of work on calming my body and my nervous system. Certain vitamins like magnesium glycinate helped a lot (helps with your nervous system as well as muscles).

"For me, and I’m in more of the acute phase here, PTSD flashbacks feel like I’m back in the traumatic moment. Physically I am not, but mentally I am. My body responds the same way physiologically as it did in the traumatic moment I tend to flash back to. My heart starts racing, I freeze/lock up. It’s different than a panic attack because in a panic attack, you are still grounded in reality and can actively think and make conscious decisions. I randomly keep reliving that moment in my day to day life. The episodes typically last a few seconds, but I have had them last longer. I’ve been told in those moments I look like I zone out by the people around me. As quickly as it comes, it goes, however, you are left with crippling anxiety about having relived the moment in the flashback, as well as a general WTF feeling about why it happened. I also get frustrated by not being able to control it. 

The biggest misconception I have come across is therapists recommending you “catch yourself” when you’re going into that state or “recognize triggers” to prevent it from happening. I laugh every time because for me there is no “catching yourself”. You’re there one minute, in the flashback the next, then back to your reality. There is no conscious realization of oh I’m going into a flashback, let me think myself out of this. Sometimes there are triggers I can point to, and sometimes there aren’t. Again, even if I recognize the triggers, by the time I have the ability to pinpoint a trigger, I have already experienced the flashback.

"For contex, i have cptsd from chilhood abuse.

Others have described the difference between types of flashbacks very well. What I get are emotional flashbacks. No sights or sounds or even intrusive memories, but I am sent back to my trauma emotionally: I freeze and am filled with fear, dread, shame, humiliation and vulnerability. I feel small and exposed, and without going into too much detail, I'll become hyper-aware of the area of my body that was the target of the physical aspect of my abuse.

I dont know if this makes for good dramatic storytelling, but I also instinctively mask my ptsd attacks. From an outside perspective, I may look completely fine. People around me will have no idea it's happening. I just get quiet and still. Everything is happening internally. Occasionally I may tremble slightly, but only in more severe cases. Oddly enough, I can even sometimes reply when spoken to... and they'll still have no idea of the agony I'm going through. No complex or thought out replies, just single words or short phrases. I'll also start crying/sobbing as soon as i can go somewhere to be alone.

I will give personal experience. I have PTSD from abuse and r\*pe. Whenever they happen it's like you're stuck in that situation again. Like you're in a loop and can't get out of it. I can't focus on anything else at the moment and i'm frozen in fear. I go mute as everything just replays in my head. I'm going through the same old story every single time. I know what happens next. And that scares me. I know how it ends. And that anticipation is absolutely awful. I dread the next few seconds as i know what's about to happen. I don't want to relive those moments but i cannot avoid them. It feels like ages but it usually lasts only a few seconds to a minute. Imagine reliving your worst nightmare over and over again as you know how it plays out. And multiply that by 10.

The way I would describe flashbacks is this feeling where time stops and I'm suddenly in the moment again. I can't focus on much of anything, I can hardly process any sounds. Sometimes the memory loops in this broken record fashion, and other times I'm stuck in it and I can't get back out. I hyperventilate and lose feeling in my limbs. Sometimes I don't cry at all and I'm more catatonic, other times I can't seem to stop crying. It's like I sink into this pit in my own head and everything else around me stops existing. I feel this primal urge to get away from whatever is triggering it by any means necessary. Sometimes I self-soothe like a kid by clinging to a pillow or blanket or whatever is near me, I stare blankly, I rock back and forth. I'd definitely associate it with a child-like mindset in general, but that could be because mine are usually flashbacks *of* my childhood. Usually by the time it's over, I'm exhausted emotionally. I don't really say much to anybody for a while, just kind of... sit there. I seek out validation and reassurance that I'm okay and safe. I need a long time to recover from particularly severe ones.

Mine are mostly somatic, so I feel them in the body. When I’m triggered by something that reminds me of the SA, my body will pulsate all over to the “rhythm” my rapist penetrated me.

"Hi,

Guy with PTSD and mental health consultant here.


PTSD - a single event
CPTSD - multiple events over prolonged period of time. CPTSD often leads to increased distrust or dislike of people/the world, relationship issues and emotional dysfunction.

It's possible but rare to be diagnosed with both of someone experiences both of those things. 

OK so flashbacks .

The media idea of a person reliving a visual representation of the even does happen but nowhere near as often as made out. I'll break down flash backs for you. 

A flashback is caused by a trigger. Triggers can be ANYTHING that the brain associates with the trauma. I've known this to be aftershave, cucumbers ice cream, BBQs and aircraft. Triggers are very personal to people and vary wildly. My trigger air fireworks, crowds and certain dates of the year to name a few. 

Triggers can kick in the fight/flight/freeze/fawn responses. The body and brain go into high alert to deal with the perceived threat and can shut down some functions like hunger, toilet, sleep etc. 

Fkashback types.

Sensory - seeing/hearing/feeling/smelling/tasting something often relayed to the trauma. It may be a combination of these. Examples include seeing blood, hearing an explosion, smelling aftershave. Etc. For me I might smell the sand of Afghanistan and see sand blowing in the wind (where I live has no sand close by).

Emotional - a person's emotions respond as if the trauma is happening again. You might get very scared, angry anxious, tense etc. The body often responds in kind so you might sweat, breathe faster, have bodily sensations such as around the genitals if sexual assault was a factor.

Memory - intense memories of what happened caused by some kind of trigger.  If you think of a time you have walked out your house and it's been especially hot which has reminded you of a time on holiday, that's a mild idea of what it can feel like.

Nightmares - either about the trauma or related to it."	Severe-Equipment-807	reply	na	na	na	0.0024566652718931437	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"For me, I have CPTSD from extended traumatic childhood sexual abuse and then further being sold into trafficking. 

Flashbacks are caused by a “trigger” of whatever sort that reminds you of the moment when you were in danger. For me, that’s a certain cologne scent, small spaces where I feel claustrophobic or enclosed, sirens, mirrors, yelling…. I could go on and on. It makes daily life seem impossible sometimes so I live secluded with my family on a large rural homestead. 

When a flashback occurs it’s as if time stands still. I’m instantly transported back into the traumatic experience. I literally relive it with ALL of my senses. I have an extremely vivid imagination as well so it makes them even more horrific. It’s reliving the experience over and over. My hands, feet and face go numb. My chest tightens and I feel like I can’t breathe. I go instant panic mode because of the lack of oxygen. My body shakes as if I’m having a seizure. It’s difficult for people to watch. Once I’m able to catch my breath then the sadness descends and I cry like I’m dying. It’s exhausting."	Severe-Equipment-807	reply	na	na	na	0.0024566652718931437	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"With full blown flashbacks I feel like it’s all happening again. It’s not just a memory, it feels more real than reality. 

With emotional flashbacks my body enters fight or flight all of a sudden and I feel like my life is in danger. This happens with full blown flashbacks too, but with emotional flashbacks that feeling is all that I experience. Sometimes I don’t even know why I feel like I’m about to die, I just do.

"It’s the worst thing ever and feels inescapable. It feels like what happened to me is happening to me again to the point that I feel like I’m laying where I was and am feeling the same fear and seeing everything I saw again right before my eyes. It’s so bad that I can feel the bed shaking again and her hand on my throat again and I feel like she’s on top of me and I can’t get up or escape. I’ve only had extremely realistic-feeling flashbacks a few times, but one time, after a picture popped up in a YouTube video that reminded me of what happened, I had such a horrible flash back that I went into a panic attack where I felt I couldn’t breathe while lying on my kitchen floor and it lasted an hour.

Edit: I also forgot to mention I have this thing called “post traumatic psychosis”. Basically I often see things that aren’t there and it’s the worst when I try to sleep (I was choked by my mom in my bed at night as a toddler). I see a mummy running towards my bed and sometimes the mummy appears on top of me and it feels like I’m being choked again. Around 3rd or 4th grade, I started getting scared of various monsters charging at me and have only recently (I’m 19 now) been getting much worse hallucinations with the choking and stuff because I am now safe from my mom. It’s really draining to constantly visualize a mummy running towards me even for about 60% of the day and 90% of the night. And I only see it in my apartment. I’ve gotten used to it but when my boyfriend isn’t home with me or when he’s asleep and I’m awake, I get very scared."

So, a ""flashback"" makes me overwhelmed, difficult to focus on anything other than feeling overwhelmed, and like a feeling that I need to do something (but the feeling over being overwhelmed makes it difficult to gather up enough executive functioning skills to do anything; in tandem with being AuDHD, I function best with routines and by removing trauma-inducing people and situations from my life)."

Getting triggered by something that reminds you of the event. Could be literally anything, from phrase, a type of vehicle, a unique smell, a song, anything. For me I get tunnel vision, heart races and a sense of impending doom. Flashes of memories I avoid and best of all physical shaking I can’t control. From someone’s outside perspective my eyes are darting around, I’m either very quiet or speaking very fast. Crying or biting my nails.

This is from the ICD and is about as accurate as it gets because it's used for diagnosis worldwide:

""Re-experiencing the traumatic event after the traumatic event has occurred, in which the event(s) is not just remembered but is experienced as occurring again in the here and now. This typically occurs in the form of vivid intrusive memories or images; flashbacks, which can vary from mild (there is a transient sense of the event occurring again in the present) to severe (there is a complete loss of awareness of present surroundings), or repetitive dreams or nightmares that are thematically related to the traumatic event(s). Re-experiencing is typically accompanied by strong or overwhelming emotions, such as fear or horror, and strong physical sensations. Re-experiencing in the present can also involve feelings of being overwhelmed or immersed in the same intense emotions that were experienced during the traumatic event, without a prominent cognitive aspect, and may occur in response to reminders of the event. Reflecting on or ruminating about the event(s) and remembering the feelings that one experienced at that time are not sufficient to meet the re-experiencing requirement."""

"I have CPTSD that started in childhood and through my adult life from different events, almost all of which involving people who I trusted the most at the time. I get emotional flashbacks. One of my biggest triggers is any kind of touch of my neck. Another is basically anything that could come off as intimidation towards me. They don’t always come on quickly, sometimes it slowly seeps into every part of my personality and can last for months. 

I become distrusting, paranoid about if anyone actually cares for me. I go into faun mode with whoever triggered me and freeze mode when I am alone. Slowly cutting off contact with all friends and hyper focusing on trying to please someone. Thoughts like “if I’m good enough, they won’t want to harm me.” Which always backfires because it’s usually focused on someone who is actively doing me harm. As I allow more and more abuse to happen, it comes to the “finale” of fight mode. I begin drinking and smoking more and more until I pop. Burning down bridges and roads as much as I can. Then, they view me as “crazy” and I slowly rebuild myself from the ground up. 

Another way a flashback can come to me is immediately. I shut all my blinds, recheck that all doors and windows are locked a hundred times and become very quiet and freeze in place. Sometimes for an hour. Every noise is amplified and I fear for my life. I get embarrassed to reach out to a friend for my fears of abandonment to come true or start to believe that I deserve to be harmed. Twice I have had audio hallucinations with this kind of flashback of my name being angrily called.

They manifest in nightmares where I am back in a place I don’t want to be at again.

Worse part is the nightmares become lucid and I can feel the recoil of my rifle as I shoot my enemies. I reach for objects and can feel them as if it’s real life. Then telling myself why am I here again? I thought this was all over and then waking up in a pile of sweat."	Severe-Equipment-807	reply	na	na	na	0.0024566652718931437	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

"The type of flashback experienced will vary based on the type of PTSD they have. People who undergo long-term, repeated trauma, such as most abuse survivors, will typically develop C-PTSD (Complex PTSD). People with C-PTSD will have emotional flashbacks. I have C-PTSD, so I will describe my experiences with emotional flashbacks. This may or may not be accurate for traditional PTSD. The type of trigger will also affect the type of flashback.

When I'm talking to someone online and they behave similarly to my abuser, I'll get extremely paranoid, first of all. My abuser hasn't attempted to contact me in a year, but the trigger will put me in the emotional state I was in during the abuse. Although I have no reason to suspect he would still be stalking me now, I had plenty of reason to suspect that during the abuse. The paranoia is one way I begin reliving the abuse.

One thing that triggers me is transphobic rhetoric (from a seperate traumatic event than described above). When I'm triggered like that, I at first get very angry and have emotional outbursts. I have issues controlling my anger, so those outburts frequently feature me harming myself or objects near me. Once I burn out on the anger, I'll regress to when I was 12. This means that I not only emotionally feel like I'm at that stage in my life, but developmentally as well. I'll act childish, basically. If your character experienced childhood trauma, this may be relevant.

Despite the trigger itself, memories will get stuck in my head when I'm triggered. I won't literally think I'm back in that moment as PTSD is often displayed in fiction, but I won't be able to stop thinking of horrible things that happened. 

I also get very anxious and generally distressed. I was obviously going through a lot of emotional distress during the events, and my old fears, self-hating thoughts, etc. will return full-fledged. Most of those types of thoughts I've recovered from, but a flashback will emotionally send me to when I had not recovered from them.

Generally, my experience can be described as returning to the emotional state I was in during the traumatic event. When writing, I would recommend remembering how the character felt during the event(s), and having them feel the same way."

"All of the negative feelings and emotions come back, and I can’t do anything to stop it. The thoughts pop up in my head. I don’t get lost or forget where I am or anything, but the memories can be so prominent sometimes that I dissociate because in my head I am trying to stop them. If I’m doing a good job, then it looks like me calming myself through some thoughts “it’s ok that’s the past we can feel but don’t linger” type stuff. If I’m not doing a good job then it might be like “stop thinking of this you stupid piece of trash go the hell away” and such. But all you’d see from the outside is me staring of into space. Maybe even crying or scratching, because again, all the negative feelings come back, including panic and fear and grief, all like you are experiencing it again. 

TLDR: my form of flashbacks got me feeling all the emotions again, but when I daze out it’s not due to me getting sucked back into the memory or not knowing where I am, it’s due to me focusing so heavily on trying to get it to stop.

"You might want to check out the book “the body keeps the score” by Bessel van der kolk. Lots of good information about trauma and PTSD in that book and what happens to the body. 

Of course it’s different for everyone and depends on what type of trauma occurred. For me I tend to get emotional flashbacks. I went through several situations involving domestic violence. So now even though I’m not in an abusive relationship anymore, the sound of a man yelling in anger especially toward me will cause my body to become tense, I tend to grip tightly onto things like the chair or whatever I’m holding, my breathing becomes shallow, my heart starts beating quickly, I cannot think clearly, I get tunnel vision, my chest feels tight, and I can’t focus on what’s really happening around me as my body thinks it’s in danger. If it’s a situation where a man is actually yelling at me sometimes I’ll start shaking and crying uncontrollably on top of the above. The anxiety takes days sometimes to shake. 

I do get visual/memory flashbacks too but those are less frequent and are more random. Like I’ll be walking and suddenly see his face out of nowhere or I picture our bedroom or something like that. Then the physical symptoms I described above show up but not as bad as if I have an emotional flashback. 

The nightmares are typically not always about the actual trauma I went through he is usually just standing there in a threatening way or something.

For me it’s like being emotionally transported to whatever moment the trigger for the flashback is associated with. It also involves dissociating/ disconnecting from the present reality as when the traumas initially happened I would often disassociate to cope.

I mean the dramatic responses you see in TV or movies are realistic for some people, but yeah the way people experience and respond to flashbacks just vary a lot. Some are able to build more coping mechanisms, and some not. So, I think it actually depends on what you’re trying to portray with your character. Like, do you want to portray someone that is completely outcasted with their PTSD, someone that tries to hide it, someone that is struggling to build coping mechanisms, someone that’s been building coping mechanisms for years, someone that’s having a relapse, someone that has external responses, someone who’s responses are more internal? It all just depends on the context. It’s okay if sometimes it’s a little stereotypical if there’s enough context to make it unique and offer more information about PTSD than the surface level info if that makes sense.

"There are a lot of amazing responses here, but I just wanted to add a few more details!

One thing people may not anticipate about PTSD/CPTSD, is the way it makes you feel shame about your reactions, and not having control over your mind or your behaviors. There's a desperate desire to just be normal again, and at the same time, a level of helplessness, because there's no real cure for PTSD/CPTSD, just coping mechanisms for the symptoms. People might witness you having an episode, and you feel embarrassed, or ashamed, and then secondarily, you don't want pity. You don't want to be seen as broken, or less of a person. But it *is* a true disability.

You also get used to the intense symptoms, after a while. You might find yourself crying, and not have any idea when it started. You might look around and realize you've been awake but disassociating, and hours have passed. You might develop weird habits, like for me, I was homeless long enough that I got used to having all of my belongings in sight at all times. Now I rarely put things ""away"" or in drawers/cabinets, because it feels unnatural or even scary. And of course, all of this makes you feel very different or disconnected from the normies in your life. In an average day, you might go through a couple hours of crying/disassociating, but you're still working a full-time job, doing chores around the house, spending time with loved ones, etc... and it's possible that most people around you, have no idea how much trauma impacts you on a daily basis."

"In movies / TV shows: they make it look like you’re imagining being *in a movie* when you’re having a flashback and it’s not that.

Even if you close your eyes and try to actually visualise your worst memory, what you see is your minds *interpretation* of that memory; a flashback isn’t that either (although it’s closer). Your mind knows when it’s replaying a memory because it’s part of your waking / rational mind. The mind is really clever in that regard; it knows when it’s in “replay” mode (visiting a memory at your request) as opposed to involuntary recollection (flashback). 
When your mind is *voluntarily* recalling a memory (you’re voluntarily revisiting a memory or have *decided* to think about a memory) your mind will often edit it slightly depending on the mood you’re in, how you perceive the memory or other factors. Those recollections are - usually - tinted slightly more positively; which is why we often remember school friends or lost loves to be better than they really were.

An example: When I think about the birth of my daughter, I recall four medical people being in the room: the OBGYN, the paediatric surgeon, the paediatrician and an assistant and seeing my daughter for the first time was the single most amazing experience I’ve ever had.

Except…it’s not true.

There were *five* medical people in the room but I never spoke to one of the assistants and didn’t know her name and had never met her before (whereas I knew the other medical people by name already), so my mind has kind of removed the blank face and I just recall there being *four* medical people being there now.

Either way, it’s a memory. A happy one and an important one, but my mind - as all minds do - altered it and removed something it felt was irrelevant (sorry lady…you didn’t do anything to deserve being forgotten but I had bigger things on my mind on the day!).

Memories like that, however important they are, are often filtered or “adjusted” depending on how we feel about them. Flashbacks are not like that at all because one of their defining - and most terrifying and damaging - characteristics is: they can’t be filtered or improved with mood (but they *can* appear worse with low mood).

They’re every bit as terrifying, traumatic and soul destroying as they were when the trauma happened because - in my case - they were perfect reproductions of the original traumas.

A flashback is - or *was* in my case - very much as if I were actually *there* again, literally reliving the experiences again. At my worst / lowest point, I was experiencing that a few dozen times - sometimes more - day and night.

My counsellor described “dissociative episodes” where i was right back where the traumas happened. Outwardly the appearance of “daydreaming” but I thank god that no one knew what was actually going through my head when that happened…I wouldn’t wish that knowledge or those experiences on my worst enemy. If it was particularly bad, I would break out into a cold sweat but I got better and better at breaking free from those episodes.

Many people with PTSD seek escape in drink or drugs but I’ve always been anti drugs and I drink less than 6 units of alcohol a year (the occasional cocktail) because I’d seen the behaviour of my parents when drunk or under the effects of drugs, so I sought escape through workaholism. I actually benefitted from it in the long run because I achieved so much despite being told repeatedly as a child that I was worthless…but if I hadn’t sought out PTSD counselling when I did, I know for certain that I’d have driven myself into the ground. 

Workaholism helped reduce the number of flashbacks and enabled me to sleep occasionally (albeit through exhaustion) but it was not a sustainable or appropriate therapy. Flashbacks are invasive, terrifying, stressful and supremely damaging both physically and mentally / emotionally. 

Friends and colleagues always questioned how the hell I could practically inhale 20,000 calories a day in food and never gain weight. The answer is: my brain was literally fighting for my life every night and upwards of dozens of times a day and it took a *lot* to fuel that kind of constant adrenaline rush.

Not sure how helpful - if at all - any of that is, but those are my experiences. If you need more help or have more questions, feel free to ask. If it helps other people understand this better, I’m glad to help.


Edit: another aspect of flashbacks that I forgot to mention (that writers and screenwriters *never* depict) is the *physical* side…and it’s quite freaky…

Something that a lot of people don’t know about flashbacks is: injuries you sustained during the trauma can - often did in my case - manifest during a flashback. 
In my case, broken bones, smashed teeth etc.

One of my most frequent flashbacks was accompanied with severe tooth pain…in a tooth that isn’t there anymore (long since been replaced with dental implant, as most of my teeth are; too many were damaged or knocked out as a child through violence). 

Another was severe headaches around the area where my skull was fractured and another was severe pain in my fingers where they were broken (a real bugger for someone who plays musical instruments). 

The little finger on my right hand never set properly and sticks out…consequently, whenever I’m playing my cello, I notice it because it’s the one finger that doesn’t rest in the bow. And when I think about it, it dredges up the memory of how it came to be that way; not a fully fledged flashback (it used to be, but isn’t anymore) but a reminder and when I remember, it begins to hurt again even though there’s no cause for it to be painful…

There is a very old scar on my left hand. There is no reason for it to be painful now and the scar is barely visible…and yet occasionally, I remember how I got it and I can still feel the burning pain and visualise my 9 year old hand impaled on his broken car aerial…there was so much blood.

The link between flashbacks / trauma and physical pain is real but I never made the connection…I just assumed old wounds hadn’t “set” properly or that I was just experiencing stress induced aches and pains…

My PTSD counsellor told me that there are cases where people manifest *visible* physical wounds from violence, such as hand marks. I am very grateful that doesn’t happen to me; I would be absolutely mortified if I were walking around with hand marks on my throat 🤦‍♂️

I agree with this very much. I suffered extreme childhood traumas, and my triggers can feel like a complex mix of any of these things. I've always held my memories in very high regard, so I didn't actually repress anything. For example, if someone starts yelling at me, I'll have what starts as a memory related flashback, but also sensory and emotional because I feel the way I felt emotionally to the letter, I smell what it smelled like, I can see what I saw, I hear all of it. This all happens in a split second, and then I'm back. I don't even think that fully describes what it's like, but I don't have better words or understanding for it.

I was diagnosed with both after experiencing violence 2 yrs ago on top of old violence plus chronic childhood abuse. I will say recently I feel like the memories were integrated into C-PTSD and it makes sense that it would. When there was acute PTSD there were more vivid intrusive memories and more physical and emotional response plus a lot of rumination.

They described in the ICD in it's description of flashbacks for PTSD (and CPTSD)..

"For it be classified as PTSD your symptoms must arise anything after 1 month of the trauma. However there is no exact timeline, it just needs to be after a month to be diagnosed as PTSD. For example, you may be fine for years and something could trigger you that reminds you of the trauma and now experience symptoms which then you are diagnosed as PTSD. For those that have PTSD symptoms immediately or less than 1 month of the trauma then you will have what’s called Acute stress disorder. If symptoms of Acute stress disorder do not go away after 1 month then the person will now be diagnosed as having PTSD. So in short PTSD >1 month, 
Acute stress disorder <1 month. So you can decide how your character starts but these are the timelines to keep in mind"	Severe-Equipment-807	reply	na	na	na	0.0024566652718931437	no	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"From personal experience, you usually start experiencing flashbacks and processing trauma, once you enter a safe environment, develop a routine, and finally have the mental space to reflect. You could show the character starting to relax in their new setting, and flashbacks creeping in, slowly getting worse. 

I would say anywhere from 3-6 weeks for the first flashbacks. For me, it started with little things like (as someone who was also homeless, then went to live in a very fancy home with my ex's family) feeling out of place with ""normal"" well-adjusted people, forgetting good manners, being constantly on alert for signs of ""danger"" without realizing it, etc. There's a sense of being very different, and unable to relate to the people around you. 

And then you gradually get into serious flashbacks, where you're disassociating or going into a full panic attack. You have to learn what triggers you, you won't know until the intense fear response takes place. There are generally a lot of mis-steps along the way."

I completely understand that. So many people claim to have PTSD when they just don’t, and it sucks when we’re here struggling every day. Being sad after a breakup, or sad when you’re reminded of that breakup isn’t an emotional flashback and it’s definitely not PTSD.

Say I am in a restaurant and I feel trapped because there are too many people around me, it triggers me, and then I get a flashback of maybe being held from behind, and I will do my best to maintain my composure while ignoring the feeling of his hands on me (which is just a memory), and I will shut down and not be able to hold a conversation very well, I will keep dropping the conversation or I’ll move away from sensations that aren’t really there, and I will eventually really snap at someone putting cutlery down loudly, or someone talking at me trying to get my attention, because it will skyrocket my stress."

"I have the same fear. I briefly talked to my therapist about it. She said that requesting a female/male doctor if one makes you more comfortable to be around. Having a conversation about what kind and duration of anesthetic is used. And like someone else mentioned see if it's possible to have someone you trust there.

A personal thing I've thought is like setting up a camera/audio recorder. It won't prevent it necessarily but I won't like spiral of what if it happened and I didn't know. Also if a doctor isn't comfortable with you recording your own surgery would raise red flags but I never had to ask."	flavorfulcherry	reply	na	na	na	0.9979379773139954	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

"Me (23F) am being stalked by my ex (24M). We dated for six years and broke up over three months ago. He serially cheated on me, was trying to fulfill his breeding kink with random women (didn't know he had that when I dated him and didn't know he even wanted kids), found out he has a violent streak and threw a hammer and a machete at some girls before he met me. Found out he has a dark side and does other bad things. He stalks women and leaves gifts at womens' houses that he stalks. My neighbor told me he saw my ex walking around my apt. complex three to four weeks ago. I have no contact with my ex and don't speak to him at all. Last time I spoke to him I told him we were never getting back together and to move on and for him to get some help.
  

  
Since we broke up I had to get a Blink camera, a stun gun and carry pepper spray as well. After finding out this from my neighbor today I considered getting a restraining order on him but I hear that it can increase violence from an ex that is stalking you. I am worried he will retaliate and flip out and get violent if I were to put one on him. Another key tid bit is that since we broke up that random men have been banging on my door since we broke up and they will glance at their phone while they knock on my door. I don't know these men and do not know who they are. I don't think its a coincidence and wonder if my ex is sending random people to my door to intimidate and freak me out. He has pictures and videos of me and I wonder if he would distribute them out to people (found out his best friend does that). Wonder if they are two peas in a pod at this point. He is very vindictive and wonder if he would do this to scare me. I had to call the cops yesterday as a random older man came to my door, kept knocking and then glancing down at his phone and then started pulling on my doorknob to get in. We rarely expect company or even have visitors and don't recognize these men. Neighbors are telling me they've lived here a while and haven't seen so much strange activity until recently.
  

  
I've had a few women tell me that when he was in fifth or sixth grade that he would follow girls around in his neighborhood and stalk them and had photos of every girl in school yearbook in his phone. His dad admitted to me when I broke up with his son that there is something wrong with him and that he has been defiant since he was a little boy. I only ever knew that he had ADD when I dated him. I never knew about his dark side or that he was serially cheating on me. He played the doting boyfriend role well. He never hit me or was violent to me but am finding out that he is after we broke up. I found out that he had Onlyfans and paid for that when he was dating me, was on Ashley Madison and he was on Tinder as well. Theres so much more I could talk about but I feel like its so much and hurting my brain to type out. Also found out he had cheated on me with his 23 year old best friends girlfriend who was 17 when he was 23. He likes to prey on underage girls and is a predator. Him and his friends go after young girls so they can manipulate and use them. Found out that he also makes videos of him and these girls and sends them to women he wants to get with to make them jealous and never knew about this either. He said he won't let me go and that he is going to work on himself to get me back. He said he wanted to marry me someday and have kids with me last time we talked. I told him I would never come near him again and that he needed to leave me alone for good.
  

  
I literally don't know what to do at this point. His family isn't doing anything about it as he lives with them and drives their car (he doesn't own it, they do). They let him live there for free and do whatever he wants as he pleases. He hangs out with a bad crowd as well and they excuse his behavior. Everyone around him doesn't believe he is like this and they keep hanging around him and he hasn't had any consequences period. But yet over here, I have to be paranoid and live in fear while he traumatizes me over and over. People are telling me to at least get a gun and learn how to shoot and I guess at this point I need to. Anyone else had an ex that stalked them and did anything of this sort. My life literally sounds like a movie. If you would've told me a year ago that this all would've happened I would've thought it was crazy and that there was no way. But here I am dealing with all of this and trying to process it all. I am trying to heal and focus on my life and he won't leave me alone. I have him blocked on everything, his parents and his friends as well. He had tried to use his friends to message me and reach out to me back in May when we broke up. As a result had to tighten up my social media and block a lot of people.

"I am so sorry this is happening to you! I was stalked and it's awful. 

First off, make sure you are documenting everything. Get a google doc or something like it and put any evidence on there - text messages, phone calls, videos of people near your house,  and a record of dates when things happen. 

Reach out to someone. There are resources online, and a lot of those who work with victims of SA or rape know how to deal with stalking. A restraining order might make him more violent, but I would ask someone who's dealt with this sort of thing many times before. You could also maybe move out for a few weeks while a restraining order or stalking injunction is put into effect just in case. 

Let those around you like friends, roommates, and family know what's going on. The more people that know, the better your odds are of a good outcome. Take the precautions necessary to keep yourself safe - you're worth it. Make sure you are aware of your surroundings. If you're on a walk, either call someone or pretend you're on the phone and take a voice recording. That way, if anything happens, you have proof. Having pepper spray or anything else that helps you feel safe is also a good idea. 

Make sure you don't get in contact with him again, because it has to be nonconsensual or it's legal. (It sounds like you're doing good in this aspect, though.) If he or anyone else shows up at your apartment, I would call the police. Doing so gets it on record and is even more definitive than any sort of document that you are keeping. 

You didn't do anything to deserve this, and it shouldn't be happening. If you ever need to talk to anyone, I'm here for you! You can get through this!"	Disastrous_Air9657	reply	na	na	na	0.9973621964454651	strong	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

Thank you so much for commenting. I have been writing down the names of people who are a witness to my ex and what he has done. I have a long list of names and my family is aware as well. I thankfully don't live alone and live with family so that does help. I have a blink camera installed that alerts me when people are at my door. Random men have been coming to my door the last few months and they will stand there and keep knocking and look down at their phones. On Monday of this week, a man kept pulling o my door knob and was trying to get in. I had to call the cops and they said I can't prove that my ex is sending these people to my door but that it could be him for sure. Disclaimer this was on my mom's birthday and my ex knows that. I bet he was trying to ruin her day (he possibly is a narcissist after reading about what he has done to me). My ex is very vindictive and has a dark side I found out. I am not sure what he is truly capable of and this activity of men coming to my door started up after we broke up. I don't know any of these men or recognize them. I have the videos of the men at my door and the man pulling on my doorknob and have it as proof. I found out from my neighbor yesterday that he saw my ex walking around my apartment complex three to four weeks ago pretending to be a door dasher. The last I spoke to him I had told him I would never date him again or come near him again. He lives about 15 minutes away from me and has no reason to be in my area or in my complex. He also isn't a door dasher and has a job working for a city's parks and recreation department. I want to get a restraining order on him but I am worried he is going to get more violent and that it will set him off. He has gotten in trouble and had tickets in the past and I can't find them online on casenet at all which is weird. His father is a very prominent employee here in my area and makes a lot of money. His family has money and they may be willing to protect him and get lawyers. My exes brother I found out was stalking his ex too (I talked to her) and she said the family is batshit crazy and is a witness to some things as well. The brother tried to push his way into her apartment when she told him to leave her apartment complex and to leave her alone. I think my ex's parents protect their sons as they have never gotten in trouble for anything and there are no case records either online that I can find. I want to pursue a RO against him but am worried because this is a daddy's money family that this may not work out well for me. He never seems to get any consequences or in any trouble with his parents. They basically fund hus lifestyle, let him have free reign to do what he wants and he drives their car around still to this day (he is 24).

"I totally agree with this post. So sorry to hear this is happening to you :( 

A restraining order may be a good idea.. The reason being is he will now be in violation of it if he contacts you again. Right now, the cops can only do so much. Ringing a doorbell or calling an ex to say they miss you isn’t a crime. But, doing so when there’s a restraining order absolutely is. If you’re not sure, talk to a professional and find out what your options are. 

I really hope things improve. I know you must feel so alone but know you’re not. It’s not your fault and you did nothing to deserve this."	Disastrous_Air9657	reply	na	na	na	0.9973621964454651	strong	no	no	na	ptsd	failed
I have been documenting and keeping videos that my Blink camera have caught in the past few months. I live with family and they are very aware of everything. I have family down the street and they are aware of a lot. I try not to go to places alone but when I do I stay aware of my surroundings and try to be quick in the stores as well. I carry pepper spray and a stun gun on me when I go out and walk around my apartment complex. I am no contact with him and have him blocked on everything that I could have blocked him on. Of course, he could try to make new accounts and reach out to me through those and bother me on various social media apps and sites. I have tightened up my social media accounts to be on the safe side. I don't think he is going to stop any time soon and as time passes he will amp things up more. He is not harmless and has a history of being violent and vindictive. His father told me when we broke up that he has been defiant since he was a little boy and that he doesn't listen and does what he wants.  I told him to leave me alone and in his head he will want to bother me more. I want to get a restraining order but worried it may not work or make things worse for me and amp him up (make him more angry). I am trying to keep quiet now and just be careful when going out and hope that he gets bored soon and leaves me alone and finds someone else to obsess over and fixate on (mind you this is me hoping for that). But I also realize that he may not and keep stalking me. People keep saying to get a restraining order but sometimes that they don't work or violence happens as a result. I also am nervous that he would try to fight it as he comes from a wealthy family who may throw money out to protect him. I also am nervous he would come to any hearings at court and I don't want to ever see him again. I am also worried that he will try to fight the restraining order every step of the way.

"Wanting to get one but am worried it will set him off. He has a record of getting violent. I had posted him to a Facebook Are We Dating The Same Guy group and some girls that knew him growing up said he has had stalking tendencies since he was younger. Another girl said he threw a hammer and a machete at her and another girl in the park near his house because the girls rejected him and didn't want to date him. He would've been ages 15-18 but not sure. Also found out he punched his mom once while we dating because she called him out on something he did and he punched her. He never thankfully put his hands on me while he dated me but I have a feeling down the road he was eventually going to. I know that if I get a restraining order on him that they will serve him and that he may lose his job as a result. I fear if this happens that he will get violent as a result and make me ""pay"" for it."	Disastrous_Air9657	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9973621964454651	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

"I am considering getting one but not sure if I have enough ""evidence"" for the judge and court system. I have been hearing mixed things from people that when trying to get one that I need proof and evidence. I have things for sure as documentation and evidence but not sure how this will go for me when I try to get one. Also want to mention that even if I get a restraining order that he is smart enough to send other people to my door to intimidate and scare me. I believe he sent a random man to my door on Monday that was pulling on my doorknob. The cop asked me who I thought this was and I told him that I had a crazy ex and what had been going on. The cop told me it is possible for my ex to send people to my door and unless I have proof that he sent them there's nothing I can do basically. So if I were to get a restraining order he can just keep sending people to my door instead of coming himself and unless I can prove he is doing then that would be a workaround for him to violate the restraining order without getting in trouble."

I am so sorry that happened to you. I actually was discussing with my mom last night that he could definitely hire a private investigator to stalk me and keep tabs on me. They all have the money to do so and to protect their reputation.

I don't even have an RO on him right now and he is already doing this right now as we speak.

I am in fear of getting an RO on him so how am I going to feel better when I put one on him and then am waiting in fear for how he is going to retaliate (beat me up, have someone else hurt me, could be murdered)?

Sorta just got to vent for a minute. As a person with PTSD I tend to be “mature for my age.” I’ve been told this my whole life.

I’m not saying all of that is untrue, but my priorities in life rn are trying to create a stable and safe environment for myself and trying to thrive.

"I was diagnosed  about 9 months ago with ptsd. Around 2 months ago I entered into a near constant state of hypoarousal and disacossiation. 

I was going shopping with my grandmother today and she noticed thati was being quiet and giving short answers.  She immediately started acusing me of not liking her, being a ""cold-hearted bitch"", and telling me that I'm mean and a bad person as well as saying that she wishes she could have a new granddaughter. 

My first reaction was a freeze response due to being abused by parents alot as a kid and not expecting this from my grandma due to her usually being a safe and supportive role in my life. 

First I told her that I just didn't have anything else to respond with bit after she got angry I told her that I was struggling mentally and I ""can't feel anything"" and I'm depressed. 

She immediately said that I'm lying and threatened to not spend time with me anymore. (Ik that numbness and depression go against eachother but I meant it more as a numbing depression iykyk) 

After more arguing she said I'm just like my dad (bipolar, addict, abuser, who used fear tactics to get what he wantsfron me) 

She also threatened to make me walk home (she was driving) 

I'm confused and even though she apologized (I accepted) I'm still confused on what to think or do about this.

"Just wanted to jump in and also say that “false memories” have been debunked. I believe the notion was created by a defense attorney for a catholic priest back in the beginning of that situation being unearthed. 

I’d suggest reading “the body keeps the score” as soon as you can if you’re seeking some understanding of how all this works. The author covers ptsd and trauma processing about as well as I’ve ever read or seen. It can help you understand how these memories can be blocked, how they resurface, why they resurface the way they do, why they seem to loop, and how it effects your nervous system and your fight/flight etc responses and why they last so long.

"False memories: no.

Recovered memories: yes. Unfortunately.

I blocked a lot of stuff out; stuff that you would think it impossible to block out, but the circumstances demanded that my mind do *something* to protect itself.

Firstly, I was hospitalised for the first time at age 6 with broken ribs, legs, arms, fractured skull and internal injuries. I was very close to death. I blocked that out partially, only remembering a strange man shouting at my mother: “what have you done?!”

For years I remembered this in a haze. I could only remember lying on the floor and this guy shouting at my mother to call an ambulance. My mind simply couldn’t deal with the colossal beating (being kicked, stomped on and smashed against the wall) I’d received, so I blocked that part out. It was literally a blank hole in my memory. I knew that I ended up on the floor in pain, afraid and not being able to breathe, but couldn’t remember how I got there.

My counsellor was really good and she had it figured out well enough to plan getting me to confront what had happened, weeks in advance. When it started to come back, I was physically sick and unable to drive home from the session. No amount of preparation could have taken away the pain and shock of reliving that experience.

There were other things that I blocked out too, for the same reason: survival. 

For example: my mother was a master manipulator verbally, emotionally, physically and sexually abusing me one minute and convincing me that I was “the man of the house” the next, to keep me in line. She actually had my younger self convinced that what was happening was “normal” and that I was the “man of the house” despite her and her various boyfriends and husbands (she was married seven times at last count) abusing me and treating me as anything but the man of the house.

She succeeded in manipulating me to the point that I blocked so much stuff out but *despite* that, my mind clearly knew I was in danger and that it had to get me out of there because I felt such a strong compulsion to run away, I couldn’t ignore it and left at age 13, to live - mostly - on the streets. 

*Even though my mind was in turmoil and had blocked out so much of the abuse, my mind was still working to keep me safe*

But so effective was her manipulation that when I was living on the streets, I would cry myself to sleep every night because I was so scared and lonely and I began to wonder why I’d done this to myself (I was to blame, clearly) and I started to wonder if I should just suck it up and go back “home”…. again, blocking things out, out of fear.

Fortunately my survival instincts won out and I stayed away from her and her toxic home. But it still amazes me that *any* part of me could have even considered going back to that abuse, just out of fear and loneliness. 

When working through it all with my counsellor, I became really angry with myself for having considered going back to that situation and it took months of working through those hidden and fragmented memories and the associated feelings before I could find anything resembling peace.

So, in my case, those particular traumas were partially hidden, partially blocked out because of a combination of fear, pain, confusion and the mind fuck that my mother was playing on me and unpicking them involved reliving them, which was - in some ways - worse than the incidents at the time because I was fully conscious and an adult, so I understood exactly what horrors were unfolding as I relived them.

It’s always better to get stuff out and dealt with, but yes, it felt like the cure was going to kill me. 

Hope that helps. I wish you well ❤️"	Fun-Rhubarb-4095	reply	na	na	na	0.023686403408646584	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"My mom started having these memories of her and my aunt at three and two years old respectively being physically, emotionally, and sexually abused at this house. My mom was separated from my aunt and told that my aunt hated her and my grandma hated them both. My mom was put in a garage and her baby blanket was burned in front of her. This torture lasted for 3 days. 

My mom finally asked my grandma about it and my grandma told her that it was all true.  My grandma and her boyfriend were going on a trip and my grandma thought it was a good idea to leave my mom and aunt with her ex bf. He was still angry at her for leaving him. He was friends with my grandma’s current boyfriend’s ex girlfriend. 

So two angry exes. They brought my mom and aunt to the ex girlfriend’s mother’s house. Then my mother was separated from my aunt. The mother would say horrible things to my mom and hit her. The abuse was horrible. 

After my grandma and her boyfriend got back from their trip my grandma went to pick up my mom and aunt from her ex boyfriend’s house but they weren’t there. 

He said he wouldn’t give my grandma her children back unless they gave them 500$. This was in 1963. My grandma wanted to call the police but her boyfriend just paid them and got my mom and aunt back. They were dirty and hungry and traumatized so badly my mom blocked it out I guess until she was in her twenties when she started remembering.

I had repressed memories. When I told my therapist about them, he told me there is always some element of truth to memories like this. It might not be 100% accurate, but something about it is right.

"Unfortunately there is usually no way to distinguish false memories from real memories. They feel the same in our brain, memories are not stored perfectly and brains can make things up that feel the same when they're pulled out of storage. 

I have made up an entire vacation I know I never took. 

BUT I was able to do this because I had planned the vacation out extensively, decided not to go at the last minute, then didn't think about it for years. That's like the perfect recipe for a false memory. Create a base, let time pass, then try to remember. I created my base when I planned the vacation.

This implies to me that even if your memories are false or inaccurate in detail, *something* is the base. And that something is probably, unfortunately, childhood sexual abuse. What else could be the base? 

So, I think you almost certainly were abused in ways that don't significantly differ from what you are remembering now. You are remembering something real."	Fun-Rhubarb-4095	reply	na	na	na	0.023686403408646584	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

You definitely need to talk to a professional.  If you do not want to, find someone you trust. An elder. Someone that could not have anything to do with your childhood. Maybe a priest.  Unfortunately, we are being programmed all the time, from childhood until now and false memory and confabulation both occur as artifacts and side effects of this programming. A lot of movies and stories, interviews on the radio or podcasts can program things into our heads that never happened. A professional will help. They have the training to differentiate real memories or confabulations and imaginations.	Fun-Rhubarb-4095	reply	na	na	na	0.023686403408646584	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"I don't mean to derail, but false memories definitely can be a thing. I've experienced them. I recovered legitimate memories of CSA a few years ago, but because my memory is so blurry (I was very very little at the time of the assault), I developed false memories that filled in the blanks incorrectly. I believed someone I knew had sexually assaulted me, when it was someone else entirely. I still don't know who, but I know it wasn't him.

I think there is a balance to be struck between ""recovered memories aren't a thing"" and ""false memories aren't a thing."" Both are very real phenomena.

It is also important to note that in manipulative therapeutic settings, completely false memories can be induced. This happened a *lot* during the satanic panic. Children's memories are malleable."	Fun-Rhubarb-4095	reply	na	na	na	0.023686403408646584	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"""Even though my mind was in turmoil and had blocked out so much of the abuse, my mind was still working to keep me safe""

&#x200B;

Thank you for sharing this, and your whole comment. I have very few memories of my childhood and teenager years with many many complete gaps. I am in the process of recovering memories of being sexually abused during this time and its SO hard for me to believe I could have possibly ""forgotten"" something so horrific/important. 

But during this time I was also doing everything I possibly could to get away from home, spend time literally anywhere else. 

The adults in my life were confused about why I was so withdrawn, and because I had blocked out the memories of the abuse - I *also* was confused. I basically began to believe their narrative that I was just ""rebelling"" and ""being overdramatic"" and ""being a bad teenager"" 

But what you said is true. **Even thought I couldn't remember the abuse, my mind was driving me to leave.** 

&#x200B;

Can I ask what age your traumas happened and what age you recovered the memories? I have multiple childhood traumas and then some as an adult. I only began to remember my childhood abuse when I was 27ish and in therapy. Its still so confusing to be that I could have blocked it out for so long."

"I feel a need to split hairs here just a bit for clarity’s sake. What one has as a memory is one thing. When you start trying to logically put pieces together, or when someone coaches a person thru those conclusions to meet an end - that’s not a memory. 

My therapist was really good about not trying to draw out information that wasn’t there. She was very good about not trying to pull out memories that weren’t there. I had a flashback episode of childhood SA that we talked thru because I was baffled by its impact, how vivid it was, and how much detail it lacked. I can tell you how old  I was, the time of year, what was happening, all of the physical sensations, could probably pinpoint what time of day it was - because I could feel every bit of it. I relived this brief 1-2 seconds of trauma as if I were there again. You know what I couldn’t tell you? Who the person was. I could tell you they were female, and that’s all. 

Where it becomes false memory territory is when I start putting pieces together logically. Who would I have been around? Who, in that group, also had a history of childhood SA? And so on…this is where my therapist did a great job of helping me understand that, while I relived that moment in time, speculating on unknown details isn’t a healthy or worthwhile pursuit. In fact, it’s been proven that even normal memories get a slight rewrite every time we go thru them. With this - these ptsd events - when you start trying to extrapolate information that isn’t there, especially facts, you’re kind of doing yourself a disservice. You’re not investigating, you’re drawing conclusions. Once you draw those conclusions, you start finding more and more “evidence” in a biased way to reinforce your conclusions. 

In a way I’m agreeing with you. Don’t get me wrong. But what happens often is not a “false memory” but more of a conscious conclusion that’s reframed as a “memory..” that’s where it starts getting blurred. 

It’s a complicated mess, and it’s very difficult, but crucial, to rely on the exact nature of these types of memories. If you don’t know who it is, you don’t know who it is. Sometimes you do know, but you don’t know how you know. That’s why so much of this sucks way more than anyone really realizes. 

Have a great day. Keep up the good fight. Stay healthy and work toward your own peace."	Fun-Rhubarb-4095	reply	na	na	na	0.023686403408646584	no	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"Yup, I can relate. 

I never saw my mother again after I left at 13 and I have received calls and messages over the years from people I knew and - ironically - my mothers friends even, that she has gad to spend all of those years since, lying through her teeth to own friends and family to explain away why her eldest son “disappeared”. She - like your folks it seems - tried peddling the “he was a naughty teen who went off the rails” narrative, but she ended up telling so many lies she destroyed her own credibility. 

It disappeared altogether when she was served with a permanent injunction…that little snippet got around rather quickly once the jungle drums did their thing…

I was four years old when the first really frightening things started to happen, but I haven’t been able to recover the one specific incident that is on the edge of my memory at that age. I was six years old when the first really life threatening incident occurred, requiring hospitalisation. That was one of the last memories we recovered because my counsellor felt that it would be the most traumatic (it wasn’t, but I can understand her reasoning).

There were so many violent incidents - violent enough to leave physical scars - between the ages of six to thirteen and the verbal and psychological abuse was pretty much constant ranging from telling me that no one would ever love me to telling me that I shouldn’t have been picked for the school choir because I “sound like shit” when I sang. 
The earliest sexual abuse we could unpick was at eight years old when I was forced into her bed with her while she masturbated. It got progressively worse from there. 

I was 36 when I began PTSD counselling and most of my childhood traumas were dealt with within the first 18 months. Unfortunately I had a hang gliding accident, a forces incident and a trauma relating to a rescue where two young children passed away before I could get to them to deal with. These things happened in adulthood and we spent the remaining six months dealing with those. 

Most of the memories were recovered when I was 36 and 37 but I had tried - in vain - to force them out into the open by attempting - repeatedly - to write a journal about my experiences years before as my head was just a confused and chaotic jumble and whenever I tried to coalesce my experiences into some sort of order to deal with them bit at a time, it was like trying to find the end of a ball of wool in a sea of wool. All that would come out was a sort of mental “arrrgghh”. 

My mind was effectively rejecting any and all attempts for me to approach the problem rationally and logically and when I described this to my counsellor years later, she said “are you surprised? These sorts of memories want to stay buried because they’re painful. It’s a survival mechanism”. I felt deflated because I’d hoped that I’d made some progress off my own back, but apparently PTSD counsellors earn & deserve every penny they get!

Another survival mechanism that my mind was employing - completely subconsciously - to protect me was that when I experienced something traumatic, I would become emotionless. At the time I couldn’t really describe it, but in the safety and relative comfort of my counsellors office, I came to identify the feeling as “metal shutters coming down”. It still happens when I’m about to do something that triggers adrenaline (like a bungee jump): the metal shutters come down and I become very focused on survival. It’s not a conscious thing but it’s something that I’ve decided to own and pretend that it’s mine rather than a fear response under the control of other people who mean to do me harm.

I never stood a chance of unlocking my own mind to get those awful memories out in the open; I’d spent so long by that point burying them under workaholism and avoiding dealing with the awful reality of what had been done to me, it took a lot of work from my PTSD counsellor and I to unpack everything. I’m sure there are people that *can* do it themselves, but I’m not one of them.

I should add: that “metal shutters coming down” response has actually benefited me over the years. My friends and colleagues think of me as unshakable in an emergency because I’m able to keep a cool head no matter how difficult the circumstances….little do they know that it’s the result of years of abuse and trauma, but you have no idea how many times keeping a cool head has kept me alive, especially in a rescue or first response scenario.

"I had CPTSD resulting from serious (life threatening) childhood abuse (4 to 13), traumas when I lived on the streets at 13, trauma relating to conflict while I was in the air force, a near death experience resulting from a hang gliding accident and a rescue (I’m a pilot and volunteer both as a pilot and as a rescuer for a civilian rescue agency) that went wrong when we couldn’t get to the vessel in time and I had to recover the bodies of two young children.

I also suffered a serious accident during a rescue whereby I was impaled on a piece of debris and nearly died as a result.

You could say I’ve not exactly had an easy life, but I have grown up believing that there are always people worse off than me, so I spared very little time, mental space or compassion for myself. It doesn’t help that in the air force, there was always a “pull your socks up and soldier on” mentality or that I was born in s country where “stiff upper lip” is marketed as a “Good Thing” (it isn’t). The forces related incident involved my having been held hostage for over 9 days and I was convinced that I should have been able to fight them off somehow, that I “failed” for not fighting them off and “let everyone down” by allowing myself to be taken hostage.

This was the biggest hurdle to recovery from PTSD for me and my PTSD counsellor spent the first **six months** trying to get me to show compassion towards myself and stop calling myself horrible names for being “weak” and “pathetic”.

She did two things that turned things around for me in this regard (not the PTSD; that took another 18 months to fix). 

The first thing she did was this: when I made a comment about me being “a pain” and “taking up a session that someone worse off than me needed”, she said:

“Who is your best friend?”
I told her.
She said “if X came to you and told you that these terrible things had happened to him, would you call him weak or pathetic or say that he was taking up a counselling session someone else could have used?”

I of course said “no”.

She then asked me why I was using such derogatory language about myself that I wouldn’t dream of using about my best friend…

She said “if your compassion doesn’t include compassion for the self, it is incomplete”. I’ve always volunteered for first aid, then as a first responder and rescue and then as a wildlife rescuer too…so the problem wasn’t a *lack* of compassion in general, it was a lack of compassion for *me*

Something clicked. The idea of being so horrible to one of my friends just made my brain register that how I was being towards myself was not ok. It seems like such a silly or simple thing, but it was like magic for me: it was just what I needed to hear, just when I really needed to hear it.

The second thing she did was this: every week, she wrote a list of things for me to work on during the week ahead.
This time, she just wrote: “Stop kicking myself. This wasn’t my fault. Be kind to myself”

When I got home, I sat at my desk in my study and put the little memo on my desk and looked at it and had a little cry. So many thoughts were going through my head but by far the most pervasive one was: what kind of a bastard must I be that someone has to write me a *note* telling me to not be unkind to myself?! (ironically, being unkind to myself in the process 🤦‍♂️)

It took time for me to accept that the bad things that had happened to me were not my fault (not even the hang gliding accident) but this was the session that turned things around and I began to gradually stop beating myself up.

The right words at the right time, forcing me to look at things from a different perspective.

Edit: I still have that memo my counsellor wrote me. It’s a bit tattered but I take it out of my wallet from time to time and you can still see “Stop kicking myself” written on it and the smudges where I cried on it. It is one of my proudest moments because it is what I consider to be the real beginning (not the six months of counselling before that point) of my recovery."	jgre34	reply	na	na	na	0.0012281466042622924	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"It’s okay to mourn the life you deserved. 

My mom comes from a family of perpetual victims. Her mother, father, and surviving siblings all live(d) a very “woe is me” life, constantly complaining about what they don’t have and how they can’t get what they want. My mom was also basically forced to raise herself and her siblings, was physically and emotionally abused, and lived in poverty for her whole childhood. 

And she rose above it. She got herself into Wharton business school, worked full time while earning her MBA. She worked her ass off and refused to settle for being the victim. To this day, my mom is and will always be my greatest hero.

She also wasn’t perfect. She made my childhood hard, mostly because of her unresolved trauma. In particular, she never let me feel like a victim—which in many, many ways is so good, but it ended up hurting my recovery longterm. I never really gave myself a pass to feel hurt, I constantly compared my (honestly… pretty fuckin severe) trauma to those who had it worse than me. And because of that, I never learned how to move on. 

Being told that I was allowed to mourn what I deserved set off a lightbulb that I did, in fact, deserve a life without trauma. I did nothing wrong, no matter what dumb people say (long story short, tw underaged sexual abuse >!was blackmailed as a teen with my nudes.

"I called the crisis hotline after a tough time and not-badly-meaning but absolute lack of support from anyone, professional or not. I'm used to it, I don't quite know why it happened but the lady was very kind. And she said two things.

The first is obvious. I feel no anger. Nothing ever happened, nothing was wrong. If I tried to tell a professional, they didn't take me too seriously - I'm not falling apart, I'm fragile but stoic.

Anger for the re-violated. It matters. That's all. Very kind.

I’m not sure if this is helpful as it was personalized, but I hope I can make it more broadly helpful :) when I first had overwhelming intrusive thoughts of self destruction, I told anyone that would listen. Almost as if it was a survival tool. One of the people I told was my allergist. They took a moment, paused, and said something that I didn’t know how to see as anything other than genuine “that would be a great loss”. I keep this in a mental box of things I’ve seen, heard or been told whenever I want to cope with my trauma by taking it out on myself physically. This person, who I knew only in a professional way, had such beautiful comforting words for me. I almost didn’t know how to take it. I expected pity, awkwardness, the threat of being committed, and overall just negative judgement. Instead of that, they provided warmth. And whether I had known it or not, I had overall made a positive impression on them where they thought if I wasn’t here, it would be a loss. It helps me remember to not believe those awful intrusive thoughts that I’ll never truly get rid of. It helps them get quiet, and helps me regain control.

That I probably had it! I had a extremely traumatic event during Covid so the isolation afterwards obviously went unnoticed. Because of that I didn’t notice symptoms for awhile so when I did I didn’t think they came from said traumatic event. I was very uneducated about ptsd and thought it was only something the military felt with, so I thought my flashbacks and dreams were some kind of vision. I became so paranoid and convinced myself I had schizophrenia. I ended meeting this girl who was talking about her ptsd and symptoms and I couldn’t believe mine were exactly the same and when I told her she was like “That’s definitely PTSD not schizophrenia.” That revelation saved me from ruining myself.

What I’ve found, though, is that the people who don’t understand PTSD and haven’t experienced it are the least sympathetic… but that’s because they don’t understand.

Someone said something similar to me in my support group. (My abuser used my faith against me so much of my trauma/healing is religious-based.) I was struggling with feeling like I’m letting down God because of some of my PTSD symptoms. Someone said, “if you had pneumonia you’d go to the doctor with no issue and you wouldn’t feel like you were letting Him down. Why would your PTSD/mental health any differently?” That helped me immensely.	jgre34	follow-up	na	na	na	0.0012281466042622924	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"One … friend (he’s actually my ex for good reason) used to say that my ptsd was my trump card and that he couldn’t argue with it. He also claimed my traumatic event gave him ptsd (it didn’t. He wasn’t even there. Wasn’t even in the same country.) and he also accused me of unaliving my own mother. (Which is part of my trauma but I wasn’t the cause).

When I was receiving help from the mental health team, even their reactions told me no one could relate. One psychiatrist likened it to a scene from a horror film.

"Honestly just from what you’ve told me, I think I would be set off from speaking of it. 🙏🏼 not sure if you’re religious but I am, and I’ll be praying for you!!

Yes, there are online support groups. I’m a believer that nobody can ever truly relate to someone else’s exact trauma because we all have different experiences and even more different reactions. Like, for example let’s say two people were abused by their significant others. Same trauma, but they may have been abused two different ways. and even if they were abused the same way, they had two different reactions to it. So even though me and my friend are connecting over our shared struggles with PTSD, neither of us pretend to know what the other has been through or how they’re feeling about it at any given moment.

I’m not sure if you can find someone with a similar traumatic experience as you, but I don’t believe you have to. I believe just connecting with someone who understands the struggle, who understands that our reactions are beyond our control, who understands that our entire lives have been uprooted by this traumatic event(s), then the world doesn’t feel so alone anymore. Your friends and family who don’t understand, they may say the wrong things and they don’t mean it but I know in my experience they make me feel so alone. I have other friends though who admit they don’t understand but they take me at my word and literally try to protect me (physically— I told you my triggers are physical so ideally they can be physically prevented by others, and I have some friends who really try that)

I’m not sure where you are or what resources you have, but I truly think online (or even in-person) PTSD support groups might truly benefit you. Even if you don’t share the specific trauma right away, just sharing how it makes you feel day-to-day is a great start. There are so many paths to healing, there is no cookie-cutter route everyone can take. 💕"	jgre34	follow-up	na	na	na	0.0012281466042622924	weak	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"Hi,

I've been diagnosed with C-PTSD in February... I'm in therapy since then. 

I'm discovering so much about myself, and currently trying to build my identity as I didn't have the opportunity as a child. It's really hard because sometimes I have the feeling that all the things I like are a traumatic response... Writing to express my feelings, reading to escape reality, skincare because bathroom is my only safe place without traumatic memories...

"Yeah. At 33 last year a new therapist along with some personal growth and some bullshit a boat load of trauma old and recent all came pouring out. It’s been about a year since i seen all the trauma for what it was. It’s been a ruff year to day the least. But after realizing I was the one who got me out of that situation and literally fought those ppl off of me when I was old enough and did my entire life. Until last year then I realized I didn’t have to fight or love them. They where friends and family in name only. Once I seen it all it sucked but now for the first time ever I enjoy life and want to be here.

"Yeah I feel that - I know I felt and often still feel really cut off from myself. Kind of like I'm sitting behind aquarium glass or something.

Like it's hard to know what I like or what fulfills me, what's going to make me angry and why.
I feel like a lot of my patterns are still built for defense, so to speak. And it's hard to connect with people - really hard when I'm tired.

For me at least, it is getting better. As I address my triggers and identify them, and sort of recalibrate my reactions, I've started to feel more like 'myself' again. 


Or at least I think so, lol. 
It's sort of weird to be uncertain as to which bits are going to settle into 'me'. But, at the same time, I'm really enjoying the color blue and I feel genuinely happy sometimes, and I'm more willing to explore - so I think I'm getting closer. :)


And it's been sort of an emotionally ugly, difficult process - and the progress isn't consistent.

But the world feels a lot brighter than when I started. 


And I think a big turning point was when  I acknowledged that a LOT of the ugly stuff used to be appropriate for the situation.  Those patterns used to protect me, otherwise they probably wouldn't exist.

And the stuff I found ugly in myself - the struggling, snotting, cowering, fighting stuff was built to protect me and it's done it's job. And so now I can let it go - and that gave me a lot of room to like just 'be' me. 
Even though that still feels kind of sappy to write lol.

Anyway, tldr: yeah - and/but it's improved and it took work and I'm happy to be connecting better and it was kind of freaky, and I'm really enjoying sort of feeling more alive and like the 'me' I sort of remember the ghost of."	eIynna	reply	na	na	na	0.0023417919874191284	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
i experienced childhood sexual abuse but the exact details are fuzzy. my whole life i have had vague memories of some very inappropriate situations and grew up with some physical symptoms (ie. vaginismus) that are linked to this type of trauma. i’ve blocked memories of who did this to me, how often it happened, and the details and i honestly do not want to remember anything else. however, this year i’ve gotten sober and i think that has caused me to have more intrusive thoughts about those memories. i have to constantly stop myself from thinking too hard or exploring them because i’d rather they stay repressed, but my previous coping mechanisms (drinking) is no longer available to me so its getting hard. i told my therapist the situation and how i don’t want to go there so she didn’t press me on it. i’m wondering if anyone has found a healthy way to cope with repressed memories and move on from them without actually unearthing or fully processing them? i plan to discuss more in my next therapy session but just wanted to see if anyone else has had experience with this	Wild_Surprise7875	post	37.13782471705622	male	White	0.015073384158313274	na	na	na	2	ptsd	no prediction.

"I'm sorry to hear that. You didn't deserve that.

Healthy ways to cope with traumatic memories? I hope someone else can chime in. Once my flashbacks start to flood in I have to sedate myself because the intensity is overwhelming and harmful and I'd rather be functional and keep stabilising myself until I am strong enough and feel secure enough to go there. For me talk therapy while life is already unstable and going through various kinds of adversity only amplified it all to a dangerous level. Now I'm focused on stability, peace, freedom etc. When 8 feel safe and ready I'll ease into it. Don't leave it too long though, because the longer you leave it to fester the worse it gets/the more it impacts daily life. 

I like watching camping videos on YouTube. Like bushcraft/survival style. Winter camping is also really calming. Try all sorts of healthy ways to cope. But do seek outside support. And open up when you feel you need to. Not when others think you should. Just don't sabotage yourself accidentally either.

Are under the care of a good Gynaecologist? Psychiatrist? Sex Therapist? You said Psychologist/therapist? You don't even need to talk about that if you don't want to, but it may just help you with other aspects of your life. I don't drink anymore but perhaps an anti-anxiety med could be something carefully added to your healing process, that stops my fight or flight response when I try and talk about it. Without it, it has been impossible. That said I've had panic attacks etc since I was 12 and I'm now 29 so my history is there. Go through doctors backed up by a psych if you can. Some find benefit with medical cannabis too. Going on walks in nature and spending time with animals, drinking chamomile tea, star gazing, listening to certain kinds of music all helps me.

Hope you find something that helps. Take care."	Wild_Surprise7875	reply	na	na	na	0.015073384158313274	strong	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"I posted here two weeks ago, when I (30M) confronted a cousin who sexually molested me when I was 5-7 years old (he tricked me into performing oral sex on him when my parents went to visit his family). 

I confronted him at a family barbecue in front of 20+ family members. A fight almost broke out as his dad and uncle tried to assault me for speaking out. I was gaslit, called a liar, called an attention-seeker, and called crazy, etc. I stood my ground and the police came. It was not my intent to get the police involved, but the neighbors called the police on the family group. 

Somewhere along the way, multiple people in my family attempted to bash my character to law enforcement, by stating that I was “seeking attention” since I “always talk about this kind of stuff.” They, in fact, were referring to a separate incident in which I was drugged and sexually assaulted by another cousin, when I was 15. 

In this other incident, I was sleeping over at my cousin’s house just as I had done from ages 10-15; he was 16. He insisted heavily on me drinking a cup of “water” before I headed to bed. Unfortunately, I obliged.

In the morning, I woke up. He had gone to participate in a wrestling tournament. I bypassed his desktop password, as it was easy back then to do that. I encountered a webcam video in his video player of him masturbating into my buttocks/sexually assaulting my limp body just 10 hours prior. 

I waited for his mother and sister to get home, and I showed the video to them. I went home and my parents told me to not say anything. Against my parent’s request, I told a group of 6-10 people at school that following Monday. 

When I got home, I received a call from this cousin’s mother (the one that saw the video), and told me that her son (cousin #2) was threatening to commit suicide if I did not retract my comments about what he had done/cease speaking on the subject. I was gaslit, guilt-tripped, and victim-blamed.

15 years later, in March of 2023, this cousin (#2) calls me over video chat on Instagram saying that the guilt had eaten away at his conscience. He asked for forgiveness for drugging me and other people, exclaiming that he was “confused” and wanted to “explore his homosexual fantasies.” 

Four months go by, to July of this year, I called out cousin #1 for what he did, and family members, in shock, attempted to use my history of seeking justice for what cousin #2 did as history of my “craziness” and “lies.” The police then gave me a call and say they won’t be able to file charges from when I was 5, as cousin #1 was 7 years old, but that they could look into what happened when I was 15 and cousin #2 was 16, as others had brought it up themselves. Essentially, they opened Pandora’s box. 

This weekend, I was told by the responding police officer that I should be expecting a visit from detectives this week, who are looking into the case.

In short, I feel relieved that my story (stories) and trauma are finally being acknowledged. Unfortunately, family members are blaming me and saying that I will “ruin” their lives by speaking up. 

An additional fact, I am neurodiverse and have been taken advantage of my whole life, but I made the best of my situation and served 8 years in the Army and have gone on to complete a graduate education in policy. I’ve been looked down upon, and assaulted, stepped on. The buck stops here. My reputation precedes me and I have no reason to lie. 

In reality, what could cousin #2, who was 16 and I was 15, who drugged and sexually assaulted me in my sleep, recorded it, had his mom tell me to stop speaking up, and admitted to it 15 years later expect? What could his mom expect? 

Would law enforcement be asking him questions/looking for him? 

I am just concerned that I will further be gaslit, victim-blamed, and called a liar. I want to put this chapter to rest, and move on with my life."		post	31.200062448946852	male	White	0.9905187487602234	na	na	na	4	ptsd	ethnicity: no prediction, age: 30, gender: male, explanation: the author specifically mentions being a 30-year-old male. there are no specific cultural references or explicit mentions of ethnicity to predict an ethnic background.

"Hi there! I hope you’re doing ok. Obviously I know that you’re stressed and afraid of what has unfolded but you certainly aren’t alone. 

I work with some pretty courageous people but I take my hat off to you because what you did was so very brave. 

I chose a different path: I just walked away from the whole stinking mess at 13 and never went back. That was the last time my biological family ever saw me and I don’t regret that decision one bit, though it was hard at first.

Family are not always blood. Family are the people we choose to be around and who choose to be around us; it has to be both of those things. The people I call family are my daughter, extended members of my late partners family and my friends. 

It sounds as if at least some of your family are taking pages out of the abusers handbook: gaslighting you and victim shaming. Good people don’t do that and they don’t try to bully you into concealing abuse that you’ve suffered. 

At the risk of offending, I’d like to give a piece of advice if I may be so bold? Treat this situation like a filter. Watch people show their true colours; the good ones will fight your corner, the bad will continue to lie, gaslight and bully. I would strongly recommend drawing a line *through* the family members who don’t have your back because if they would betray you over something this serious, they’re not worth knowing. 

I know how much the traumas, burying them, then having to relive and unpack them through counselling hurt me and stressed me out so I can only imagine how much stress you have dealing with the police on top of everything else. But please remember that you’re not alone and I’m here if you want to talk.

You did the right thing.

"At 33 speaking up cost me my entire family and community. Pretty much played out how you described. As soon as I questioned abuse and their covering it I was cast out completely. Even people who know the truth family and even other victims. They all chose money and not wanting others to know they had been abused by people respected by our greater community.

They used cops, judges and millions of dollars to squash all and any resistance. I finally realized enough last year to get the hell out of dodge. It’s been a ruff year but the peace and joy I’ve found are real and have lasted through life events that would have put the old me on a bad road. Now sense I’ve seen it for what it is I’ve been able to see me.

The real me, not the liar, or lazy wasted talent. My family always said oh your so talented but you need do this and that better and drop talking about all this cause it will only hurt me. Nope just them. I hope you have some real support? I left states and turns out the statutes most likely aren’t out and some dr’s and people do want to help.

Some just can’t understand how you could be in the army for years or run multiple businesses and still be so manipulated by friends and family. But when it’s so much for so long especially when it starts at such a young age. Like some ppl get mad and don’t want to believe anyone can be so wronged by so many without doing something wrong. Believe yourself. We know or have a good idea of what’s real. Learning to trust my own eyes, ears, and thoughts have helped me get more awesome results in life than I knew possible.

I’m sorry your dealing with all this shit on top of life’s normal shit. But I’m proud of you for standing up for yourself. Just keep doing it. Don’t worry about getting little things wrong. Don’t give people who gaslight you the time of day. It can trip us up. The more I listened to truth and seen more of the truth life’s been awesome sometimes now.

Never had that before last year. Never once had a desire that was mine. They had all been crushed by religion, drugs, and evil ppl. There are good people out here but one thing I’ve learned is no one can help us like we can ourselves. Thinking about how I think and zeroing in my daily habits have helped a lot also.

We all need someone. Having a good support system is ideal. I know we all aren’t that lucky and relationships don’t last forever. I was completely alone for a long time. I had family but they are monsters. I did find my SO around 18 and would been dead long ago if not for her. But we got us this far. We made it through things a lot don’t recover from. Yeah we might have ptsd forever but I’ve had it since I was a child. I’d say life’s a million times better since self love and self respect met good help and good people.

We got this shit! Just keep being you. Keep asking when you don’t know and believe what you do know. You are the most valuable person alive as I should be for me. I know that doesn’t come easy to me but the more I put the ppl I really love first and me second it’s so much easier to do all the things I should do for me but have a easier time helping others do. Self care and love are amazing tools if you’ve never had it from your family. It has opened up so much for me. As far as the cops. Just be as simple and consistent as possible. And a lawyer if you can afford one or maybe a free one would take your case. Unfortunately the only thing I know about the legal system is more money thrown at it means more or less justice. Just depends on the case and the ppl running it. I’d recommend a lawyer at very least. Good luck op!"		reply	na	na	na	0.9905187487602234	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

So I am trying everything to stop the flight/fight response. I have done ice water to the face, slapping my face, grounding techniques, distractions, talk therapy, Journaling. None of them work.

It’s going to be ok. You’re still here and it really sucks I know. Currently in the same state as you.  Feeling super triggered as I have to fly and it’s sending me into a huge flight response. I’m terrified. But all I can say is hang in there, listen to music, take a bath. Water helps me soften a bit…tell yourself you are ok and you got this. It’s all going to be ok. Sounds silly but I find some reassuring self talk can help calm the nervous system. I say things to myself like “your ok, your going to be fine, it’s just a reaction, be soft with yourself, be kind to the reaction..” checking in with your body what feels like a yes to you and what feels like a no, as I find the no’s often trigger that reaction..Sending love.

"If you possibly have ADHD, it would be your best bet to get diagnosed and start on a low dose of medication. When the medication kicks in for me, the “house full of hamsters” turns into one hamster. PTSD and ADHD are a terrible mix that feed into each-other; prior to taking medication, I could never calm myself, and when I would get triggered it would ruin the rest of my day, and hurt my sleep. Good luck, definitely see somebody for this! This is your life and you deserve some control!

"Part of the reason there's a difference between Complex PTSD and PTSD is that trauma from a single event, while disruptive, doesn't integrate itself into how a person forms coping mechanisms. 

In complex trauma the ability to separate your own life from your life with trauma gets blurred. In the beginning, it's easier because your coping mechanism gets formed around where you are and what's happening in your life.

The further away from your trauma you get, the less effective crisis coping responses become. They fall out of sync with your life as it changes, people around you change, your stresses change..

The response to that is a slow shift to long term coping strategies, which manifest as emotional sensitivity, self isolating behavior, lower tolerance for unexpected stresses, and hyper vigilance.

It's the last one that can sink deep into a person and disrupt their ability to relax and reset. 

Your body is manifesting a constant stress response.

When it doesn't go away, and is something that's getting in the way of being functional, it's time to go tell someone about how your feeling. 

Find a way to channel that feeling that doesn't stop. 

For me, it helps to go on here and other subs to give people advice or support about the struggles I've had and have worked through already.

I'm by no means over my trauma or the other issues I face, but helping other people helps make the progress I have made more tangible and real to the part of my heart that won't let me find peace when I need it.

Lastly.. recovery takes time. 

It's not fucking fair that after living through hell, the lasting effects of it keep coming back to fuck with our lives.

The only way to get better is to keep moving forward. 

When Im feeling the worst, I remember how long I let how I felt dictate what I did. How much worse it made my life after everything fell apart. I remember that it's not fair. I remember that I deserve more than watching my life fall apart again. 

It's. Not. Fair. And I'm done being a victim. I find the anger and rage over all the ways what I went through wasn't fair and didn't have to happen. 

Then I force myself to get up and make a change that'll make the future where things can be fair again all little closer. 

I'm not going to be another sad tragic story of a broken person who got more broken.

I can't imagine what you must be going through and I'm sorry to hear that. I don't know a lot about ADHD, but I do understand how frustrating PTSD is. Some times I have trouble with grounding myself through flashbacks and anxiety. What helps me sometimes is deep breathing exercises, (asking someone to help me with the exercises is better, especially if it is a loved one), my meds, and sketching art. Also, positive self talk.

"When our lives show us how dark the world is, the only way to move on is to find that core part of you that isn't willing to surrender to anything.

Your choices got taken from you.. The childhood you deserved was stolen from you. The person you should have been able to grow into with love and support from your parents.. That person isn't dead. Just hidden deep, far away from the pain, the confusion, the regret, the doubt, even the anger.

The person you should have been, has nothing to do with the people who hurt you.

Reintegration is the process of finding balance between what you learned from your loss, and how to use that to see who you are. Not just now. Not just in the past. But who you want to be after all this.

Trauma lasts as long as it needs to. Some of us will have symptoms for the rest of our lives, but even then, it doesn't define how we live. Only what we deal with and what we know. Sometimes it's helpful to know how dark things get so you can reach into the darkness another is lost in and show them that you survived.

Burn with your pain. Make it your fire. And shine a light for those who are lost, warry, and broken. 

Even if it's just to say, we are not alone.

For me. Just that little part helps me keep pushing for a better tomorrow.

Sometimes a day won't get better. But a single day isn't the rest of your life. So in those low moments where you feel overwhelmed and nothing works, do something that'll make tomorrow a little easier. A little better.

It wasn’t until I was about to become a father (which I’d put off for years out of fear I had “evil genes” like my parents) that I suddenly woke up from the hellish nightmare and thought: “I don’t want my daughter to have a broken daddy” and started counselling.

It sounds to me as if you’re already ahead of the curve and I applaud you for it.

I wish you well ❤️"	ultimatehyperbole	reply	na	na	na	0.0013602596009150147	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
"Ever since my big trauma, I (20F) have noticed I have bigger emotional reactions…to stuff that isn’t that serious. I feel like I am behind with people my age, on how I react emotionally to things. To be fair, I was a freshman in college when my SA happened, but now I am going into my Junior year.

I get angry more easily. I have sometimes violent intrusive thoughts against the person who gave me  the trauma (of course, I would never act on them). I get angry more easily at other people. When I feel like getting physical, I separate myself in order to not harm other people. It’s an anger management problem. 

When I’m sad, I feel like my fight or flight is triggered. But, I also sometimes go mute? Like I physically can’t talk until I calm down.

"You’re absolutely not a monster and - yes - I’ve been where you are. 

I blocked everything out for years until I was about to become a dad when I was confronted with the reality that unless I dealt with what had happened to me, my daughter would grow up with a “broken” daddy and so I began PTSD counselling.

Up until that point, I’d used workaholism as my self-medication. I don’t touch drink or drugs but instead directed all of my anger, anxiety, pain, fear and other toxic emotional energy into working long (100+) hours.

When I started PTSD counselling, I didn’t have that any more as I was working from home and caring for my newborn daughter and her terminally ill mother who was - by that stage - in a vegetative state. So as I began unpacking what had happened to me through counselling, I had all of that emotional energy - plus more - and nowhere to direct it.

Yes, I was a live wire and yes, I could get really upset by the littlest things, but I couldn’t allow myself to behave that way around my newborn daughter or my partner as they were completely dependent on me (feeding, bathing, changing, medication…).
My counsellor did a really good job of helping me do things to relax and we ended each session by putting everything we’d discussed back in an imaginary “box” and - surprisingly - it helped loads.

I’m sorry this happened to you and that you’re going through such a terrible time, but please remember first off to be compassionate to yourself; please don’t refer to yourself as a monster because you’re not that. 

My PTSD counselling ended years ago and I’ve been free of flashbacks ever since. I do still occasionally have nightmares, but they’re nowhere near as bad as they were.

"It’s normal to feel big emotions after something scary and traumatic happened and I strongly recommend therapy so that you can share how you feel regarding the traumatic event that you experienced 

They can help you safely process your emotions

As for comparing oneself to others - my best advice is to never do it

People fare off better in terms of happiness when they don’t compare themselves

Furthermore - you never know what someone has or doesn’t have or what they’re struggling with from an external perspective 

Instead treat everyone including yourself how you want to be treated

Be happy and proud of those that have better or more than you (you can get those things too)

Be someone that helps others that have less than you 

Otherwise - only compare yourself with who you are (your past, your present, what you need to help you get where you need to go)

The reality is that everyone in life will either have more or less of something in relation to us

Just like we will also have more than others even when it might not feel like it

A better question is - am I happy about where I am? If not - what can help me improve / feel better and become even better than I was yesterday?"	Roseyposey03	reply	na	na	na	0.09671837091445923	weak	no	no	na	ptsd	failed

"This medication costs over $1000 for 600 mg of lab created CBD before insurance. There is no generic available. It is likely a tier 4 or 5 medication on your drug formulary and even with very good insurance, assuming you meet the FDA requirements for a prescription, you’d be paying several hundred dollars a month for it. 

Meanwhile, you can buy 1000 mg of CBD with full COA from any number of dispensaries or hemp farms for a fraction of the price. 

And these are not created in a lab. They have the full spectrum of cannabinoids and other parts of the plant that actually make cannabis a medicine, not just man made, isolated CBD.

"When I was 12, I was in little league. It was time for batting practice and as most kids especially little boys do, there was teasing as we stood there for one minute too long and boredom hit.

 Some others starting teasing me about how I had a crush on the coach's daughter. Well, he overheard this as he was going down the row checking our uniforms and posture. He insisted I go up to bat but told me to put my bat down. That was a red flag, but I wasn't sure what was going on so I did as I was told. He had a bucket of balls sitting beside him at the pitchers mound and started talking and then yelling at me about how much he hated me and would never allow his daughter near me. He started throwing balls at me, beaming me with them. I tried to walk away, and he screamed that I better stay still or it would get worse. He made me stand there in front of everyone while he unleashed the entire bucket of baseballs on me while yelling all sorts of messed up things.

 Everyone was so dumbfounded afterwards that no one moved a muscle or said a word not in my defense or anything. I ran away as fast as I could after that and was approached later about it when some of the kids spoke up after the fact, but like many child abuse victims, I just stayed quiet about it. I was covered in bruises and it was obvious what happened. Nothing ever happened to that coach... to this day it eats at me. I still see toxicity in the baseball community over many things, mostly fueled by sexist pigs, and it is really hard to enjoy it, but I have been trying to get back into the things I loved as a child lately and try to forget about those ordeals."	digi-liger	post	31.266863303468156	female	White	0.9973030090332031	na	na	na	1	ptsd	no prediction.

it doesn’t happen as frequently as it used to, but there will be times where I pass some generic looking man and it looks like my abuser- deep down I know it’s not him, but my brain doesn’t seem to be able to stop over-thinking about the potential danger/threat of if it’s actually him. Usually I just try to remind myself that it’s just my imagination and that I’m safe, but it’s very difficult for me to turn it off and not think about it for the rest of the day or even week.

"I was responding to a distress call and one of the souls on board the vessel looked somewhat like my mother. It’s the only time in my search and rescue career that I froze - albeit very briefly - during a rescue.

What made it worse was the thought afterwards that even if it *had* been her, I would have been forced to rescue a physically, verbally, emotionally and sexually abusive monster.

It happened again earlier this year but it actually *was* the guy I served with in the air force. He was a bully; homophobic, racist and cruel. He told me that grieving for my fiancé (who’d passed away a few weeks before) was “sissy”.

I was parked outside my daughters piano tutors house while my daughter had her lesson and I saw this old guy fall over in the street.

It’s the worst when it’s multiple times a day, I can relate to that. I don’t think it’s a hallucination as much as it’s a trauma response.

Ironically I think it’s kind of been like an exposure therapy thing because the reaction isn’t as strong now. I see them and they are in a uniform and it’s much easier to remind myself that this person is NOT who my brian immediately assumes it is. Also I did tell the person who hired them who I thought they were at first. I also told that person so at least if I give them strange looks they know why. “Hey you look like the person who legit wanted to kill me so when I do double takes on a regular basis it’s just me not you and don’t flatter yourself.” And no that wasn’t awkward at all but in the long run it made things way safer for me. I’m also very lucky to have a excellent security service here who I absolutely know has my back if anything were to happen. Not to mention a plethora of VERY secure areas to go to. But still.

I don’t feel safe when anyone, ever, is in the same space as me. It’s severe and debilitating and it’s completely blocking my ability to make progress in therapy. Long and very extensive history of severe childhood trauma is behind it so I don’t have a frame of reference, and I’m cognitively trying everything I can but running into walls of intense dissociation or visceral reactions and I’m completely non-functional thanks to it. Grounding techniques don’t help, online sessions don’t help the fact I’ll need to be in person for EMDR, there is nothing I find soothing that I can engage with in those states due to how severely it shuts down my cognitive abilities. He’s at a complete loss, isn’t the first, and I feel like an utter lost cause. I’m trying everything I’m cognitively capable of and it’s not enough. On the end of my tether.

"Some of the best advice I’ve been given when dealing with my ptsd and fears/paranoia: look at the evidence. When I don’t feel safe, I ask myself “why”, I look for any real reasons I have to feel this way. If it’s based on past experiences, negative intrusive thoughts, compulsive force of habit, then it’s not real. People are also human and multifaceted, no matter how trustworthy they are, sometimes they may say something that rubs you the wrong way. Try to remember it normally comes from a place of compassion when you are truly safe. I hope this helps :)

"My counsellor got me to make up two scent bottles:

Get two small sample bottles (plastic) about 30ml size.
Put cotton wool in both.
Put a *sharp* scent (citrus or mint or albas oil) in one and put a *soothing* scent (lavender) in the other.

When you have a flashback or panic attack, take a sniff of the *sharp* scent.

Then when you’re feeling that you’re more in the here and now, take a sniff of the *soothing* scent.

How it works:

Our sense of smell is *old* in fact it’s part of the oldest area in our brain and so smell has a direct superhighway link to the areas responsible for fight or flight; or at least can influence them.

This is why certain smells can drudge up long lost memories or force you out of an invasive thought and back into the here and now.

It worked for me and for friends with combat related and other PTSD. YMMV but the science behind it is sound.

I just self harmed for the first time since I was 13. Im a single mom with pretty much nobody. I’ve been living with my boyfriend and his family for 2 years and it’s been really toxic.  for some reason I’ve loved him despite him proving to me over and over again he wants nothing to do with me. I let him lie to me and fed into the fever dream that I was wrong. But when a person leaves you crying on the floor because you had a bad reaction to a antidepressant that made you suicidal maybe he doesn’t care about you. I’ve begged a man to stay that I know doesn’t love me, over and over again. He just broke up with me and seems so cold about it. He just doesn’t love me. It’s tearing me apart in so many ways like why am I so unlovable? Why do I always end up here where Im at. Im so fucking scared I don’t know what I’m about to do I’m so scared I’m about to end up on the streets because I’ve financially depended upon him. I hate this feeling of being unloved.

I found it silly at first (because anything resembling self compassion my “part x” as Jonah hill would say meets it with cynicism), but my therapist had me make a “crisis plan”. One thing on there that is small and somewhat universal is to smell my perfume. While you may not wear perfume, smells we have positive associations with can be very grounding. Things like that never solve the problem as a whole however, they ground me and help me reboot. Smells, sounds, sights etc. For me that means my perfume, a playlist I made on Spotify labeled lovingly “calm the fuck down” filled with my fav songs that help me chill, and sometimes just sitting in my fav room and observing my surroundings. When in doubt, just ground yourself.

"currently in my anniversary months. this may not work for you but for this time, I allow myself to unpack it, let it spill out and be able to feel the hurt and confusion and discomfort. I also pack it away for ten months of the year so it doesn’t spill on everything for 365 days. but for 60 days I allow it to be on the front burner and feel. (prob not the healthiest but works for me)

for a different anniversary, I try to reframe it, make it something, anything but about that. it needs to be anything but that, so I will go to an aquarium, take my dog to petco and let her go shopping, have my wife and I go on a road trip with no destination, create art. 

but something that I do on both these anniversaries, I go into the ocean, (any body of water will do) swim far out where I can just touch the bottom, and go under and let out the most guttural scream. (often accompanied by a stream of tears) no one can hear it, it’s cathartic, cleansing, and so very powerful.

I also suggest the Walker book as it’s changed my entire view of myself. He has good suggestions for managing flashbacks and learning how to talk back to your inner and outer critics. You can get a sense here http://pete-walker.com/ . There’s also some good free therapists on YouTube like Heidi Priebe, Patrick Teahan, Dr Kim Sage, Tim Fletcher.   My other strong suggestion in dealing with trauma—which is a physiological condition!—is learn how to calm your nervous system. There are multiple ways to do this but basic breathing and stretching exercises are easy and it you can afford it acupuncture is wonderful. All the best to you and hope you find relief soon!

I wrote a trauma letter to my girlfriend. I would never be able to get everything I have to say out by sitting down and having a talk. So I wrote a letter, which after proofreading and edits is still discombobulated rant of how much something broke me.  But it gets everything I want to say in words. I’m stuck not knowing how to deliver it to her. I want to talk to her about it. I have it on Google docs and considered just sending it to her with only means of commenting on it. But I feel like it would be inappropriate to drop such a bombshell on her. She says she wants me to be able to communicate my feelings, but I’m afraid I’ll hurt her for how I really feel. She doesn’t know that I resent her for what she did. She doesn’t know that I’m so angry at the world solely because of what happened between us.

Also Breaking Bad. It's one of those shows I put on in the background sometimes when I get in those moods where I like to sulk in my trauma. Nearly every aspect of that show is something that I have experienced repeatedly throughout my life. Since it's one of the most popular shows of all time I just hear people talking about the actual show, the writing, the cinematography, which is all great. But the genius of the writing and how accurately it captures the real nuances of the subjects it covers is insanely triggering... Especially in the breaking bad movie El Camino, which really captures Jesse's PTSD in a way that's very close to mine."	significantsk	reply	na	na	na	0.0015616965247318149	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

TW suicide/self harm/rape     Okay this one is kinda controversial and maybe a bit predictable but 13 Reasons Why. Like obviously it’s supposed to be about trauma and mental health but everyone always talks about how it’s not a good show and the story is bad and the characters seem fake and then they say it glorifies suicide. But personally i think the exact opposite. Before i had trauma and started watching it i couldn’t get through the first few episodes bc i thought it was boring and i also started to think that it was glorifying it by putting it in a drama like that but years after when i had became suicidal i started watching it again and it made me really not want to do it anymore because of how much it caused after Hannah’s death and how it screwed up an entire town. And about midway through watching the first season is around the time when i got raped, and when it got to the part where Hannah gets raped it was like this whole new set of emotions it felt so personal and i started crying which doesn’t happen often at all from shows for me, and especially not before then, and it was suddenly like it wasn’t just a show anymore to me it had real meaning and gave me real emotions and to this day a show has NEVER felt that personal to me. And Ofcourse it hurt that it felt so personal because it was almost like i was reliving it but that’s also what i liked about it is that it made me feel something big despite whether it was good or bad that is what a show is meant to do in my opinion. And obviously it’s not for everyone because of how triggering it can be and honestly i should’ve probably waited longer after my trauma before watching that but yeah.	significantsk	reply	na	na	na	0.0015616965247318149	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

i love my family more than anything in the world, especially my mom, but sometimes (all the time) i react unacceptably. i get angry, yell, get attitude, or say mean things and use sarcasm in a rude way.

they make me angry first, or do the most unharmful littlest things that set me off and i react horribly. i want to learn how to react more calm and not flip out and get agitated so easily like i do.

people say think before you act, and trust me ive tried. i have OCD, ADHD, PTSD, etc etc. which makes my brain process things differently and sometimes (mostly) react out of past trauma responses/experiences (i had a beyond fked up childhood, barely even had one at all) or bottled up hurt and anger.

most of the time i dont mean to and i feel extremely bad after.

the other day i ran into a door and i said ow. my mom asked if i was ok, and i ignored her because i was agitated and when im agitated or upset i don’t want anyone to talk to me because 9 times out of 10 ill react by yelling.

she asked me again and i said yea im fine. i raised my voice a bit so she can hear me because i was in the kitchen and she was in her bedroom, and she said “quit the attitude” i wasnt even trying to get attitude.

it made me more irritated so i said (in a attitude tone) i wasnt trying to get attitude and she said i dont know why u talk to me like that and i said because im upset and im obviously gonna yell or get angry when you try to talk to me.

i forgot the other parts, but we did yell at eachother and it crushed my whole mood. for the rest of the night i was angry, upset, and crying.

i ended up apologizing and saying i love her and i didnt mean to yell.

i also get impatient with my siblings because their behavior is bad and they say rude things often and i react by being rude back or raising my voice.

i love my siblings, but they are stressing me out so badly im starting to hate them and its causing me to be mean and lash out.

especially towards my brother. he makes comments all the time and i react by making comments back or yelling, and i feel kinda bad after.

one time it got physical and i felt horrible about it once i calmed down.

i feel like im always complaining about how my siblings stress me out to my mom and straight to my siblings faces but fuck dude its affecting me negatively in so many ways. all the stress and annoyance from them is hurting me.

i feel like im the negative one all the time.

i dont want to be negative and i dont intend to, im just struggling and in a lot of mental and emotional pain and i dont have many other ways to express it besides complaining and saying the bitter hurtful truth about how i feel.

ive tried to work on how i react and i do it good then i end up losing it. its a never ending cycle. i cant do it by myself but i dont know how to get help with this.

i have anger management issues and i want to get ahold of myself and how i react to things, especially since my dream career involves me interacting with people in their most vulnerable and heart-breaking moments.

im on meds and have a counselor and psychiatrist so i might talk to my psych doctor about this during the next appointment in 2-3 weeks.

does anyone have any methods or ideas that can help me react more calmer and responsibly?"	metalbalmer	post	14.095320490668271	female	White	0.9976617097854614	na	na	na	1	ptsd	no prediction.

Work is killing me. I'm making moronic mistakes because I'm constantly triggered by work and the intense inconsistencies, lack of training, and totally communications blackout that I'm enduring. I don't know how to operate, I'm often in survival mode and the level of tension is disgusting. I hate the situation I'm in, I feel trapped by the perpetual cycle of being in trouble and getting attacked and accused of stupid shit. It's awful and I can barely take it anymore. I feel so incapable and stupid. I'm so much better then this but this job is killing me, I don't know how to escape this cycle and get better. Leaving may fit but it comes with different problems, so I'd rather experience the pain and go through it one day at a time. Any advice would be helpful.

Look into what autism looks like on YouTube. I recommend (adult with autism), that’s the guys channel. Than look for videos that go more in depth about how u are different if u are autistic. Often doctors misdiagnose and are hesitant to give an autism diagnosis probably b/c this may entitle u to workplace accommodations and disability benefits.

Therapists are not necessarily competent just because they were able to get that title. They are educated according to gov policy and so most will not necessarily be accurate in diagnosing.

does this happen to people with PTSD? i get terrified of getting too anxious/stressed/scared because something happens to my blood pressure and i feel like i’m slowly losing consciousness and sometimes i actually do faint. it mostly started last year and it would happen at least once a week but now it’s more like once a month, but i still absolutely dread it. it honestly feels like i’m dying. it’s excruciating because it’ll last at least 2 hours and i’ll be physically ill while random moments of my life that i don’t remember flash through my mind.

Sounds like the hyper ventilating is making you faint, not the PTSD. It also sounds like you are in the early stages of PTSD/anxiety/panic, which is the most important time to go to the doc, even the ER. Always best to see someone when you are in the attack. Paramedics know all to well what is happening and they tell the ER doc what's up, so even if you are calm by the time you see a doc he or she already knows the score. I'll give you a piece of advice not related to medical advice. No panic attack can hurt you, only your reaction to it. Fainting is a sign you are over reacting to it, but it is also a sign you need professional help.	Necessary_Web2551	reply	na	na	na	0.9987140893936157	no	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"This exact thing happens to me. I have a condition called POTS, you might want to look into it... basically, it's a dysregulated nervous system condition, where your blood pressure lowers, usually from standing up quickly or standing too long, but it can also make you more susceptible to fainting from anxiety. 

When your nervous system is out of whack, your body can start responding to anxiety in unusual ways, such as sudden drops in blood pressure. You need to get regulated again, by calming your nervous system down on a daily basis. You can use therapy, proper nutrition (often vitamin B12, magnesium, and D can be linked to this issue), exercise, and lifestyle changes. It will take time, but every small step can make a big difference."	Necessary_Web2551	reply	na	na	na	0.9987140893936157	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
thank you so so much 💗 i went to the ER twice because of these attacks and it’s helped me calm down by the time i see the doctor, but i wish these attacks would stop or lessen in severity especially since i can’t afford the ER bills now that i live in the states. i’m wondering if there’s a medication that could help—i get horrible nightmares too so maybe it’s also lack of good sleep	Necessary_Web2551	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9987140893936157	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
They will lessen but probably never go away.  It's part of us now. We have to get used to it. If you get a prescription (mine is Xanax) use it when you get the feeling it is coming on. Works like magic. I now can fight it almost completely and have them down to five minutes at the most. Even the most severe ones last only five minutes or so.  But it took a while to get here and a lot of Xanax. Now I take Xanax once a year at the most. What works best for me is knowing the fact that the panic/anxiety/fear cannot hurt me. Not even a little.  It's how I react to it that can hurt and your hyperventilating until you pass out means you have some serious work to do. It can be done, though.  And if your PTSD is from physical trauma, or mental trauma, something you witnessed, then just tell yourself it is over.  Gone.  It cannot hurt you anymore. But more reason to talk to a professional. And don't forget if it gets really bad you can call the Crisis Hotline.  Just Google that with the name of your town and you will get the local number.  Sometimes calling 911 is not the best option. Cops just want to arrest usually.  Good luck.	Necessary_Web2551	reply	na	na	na	0.9987140893936157	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

Everything’s over now and I’m supposedly in a better place in life, but I’m a disaster. I barely sleep anymore, I’m on medication but I just dread sleeping because of the nightmares. I also hate the process of going to sleep because unless I’m 100% distracted (headphones in, tv on loud, etc) I will spiral. My lack of sleep is affecting everything else in my life and I’m just becoming a mess. I have a therapist but it’s the daily mundane things I can’t seem to handle.

With PTSD it isn’t “over” for us. The trauma you endured changed your brain and it’s a long process to heal. I don’t have nightmares so I don’t have advice for that. But I do have sleep dread. Work on developing a consistent sleep hygiene routine if you haven’t already. I have AC and a fan, blackout curtains, sleep mask, and I do the same things every night before bed. Try to make your bedroom homey, safe, and comfortable for you. Get a big goofy stuffed animal, some Knick knacks that bring you joy, or a light that projects the constellations. It sounds stupid but if you make your space comforting to you it tricks you into relaxing. There’s also guided meditations which help some people relax. Make sure your bed is only for sleeping. And ask for help from your doctor when you need medication to help you through a rough patch.	darbanator	reply	na	na	na	0.9994754195213318	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

No prob. I’m an experienced insomniac lol I have many more suggestions but those are like the starter pack. It gets better but sometimes it gets worse and then better. Trauma takes time to process.

"I found Pete walkers 13 steps helpful recently. Start here I think.

I freak out work from time to time. It keeps me smoking to be honest so I get breaks. I'm no hero

Its hard but I've noticed lately that I can sometimes channel work mode and snap out of it. If realised it's why one person is so hard on me all the time. Not saying its easy and you can snap out of it. I've cried in the bathroom before and I'm not out of the woods either. It f'ing sucks.

Other things I do at work, I focus on the people I can chat and joke with to stay calm because they are. Familiarity can be great. Music can help sometimes too. I hum to myself when nervous. Lately I've been bringing stuff I found from a somatic mediation podcast called the felt self. Looking at your surroundings, the four walls, recognising this as a safe place. It's probably not perfect, but it's not the place you've been before, that your mind is trying to protect you from now.

Whatever you do just remember, you're doing the work. It's harder for you then most so you've more reasons to be proud of yourself dammit. 

I cried all the way to work last Saturday and had a panic attack or three before work today, sometimes we surprise ourselves when we keep going. We are just as valuable in the workplace as all those people who dont wana be there. One foot in front of the other. Focus on the job at hand if you can.

"I know how you feel. 

First off, if someone at work has told you that you’ve been warned for taking off due to health reasons (yes mental health IS health), then that is probably most likely discrimination. 

If FMLA isn’t an option, does your state have PFL (paid family leave)? Would that be an option? And it is good that an hr rep said disability may be an option. That is a good thing. Remember there’s hope :) 

Second, Is there something your work can do to make your environment more comfortable and less triggering? With “reasonable accommodation”, they would have to help as long as it doesn’t create “undue hardship” on them (assuming you’re in the US) 

When your therapist does return, talk to them about this. How to cope. Look into if medication is the answer for you. I hate to come off bias, I just know how much it’s helped me. 

Most importantly, right now, just breathe. I know it sounds stupid but breathe. Nice and slow. It’s okay to be upset. It’s okay to be panicked. Don’t judge yourself and just focus on breathing.

There's a tear between being glad because of what they did to you, sadness because of the good memories, grief, because that's how you're *supposed* to feel when a loved one dies, and guilt because you're not supposed to feel hot over their demise.

All these feelings are valid.

You are allowed to feel what you feel, and no one can tell you they're wrong. Accept them, because you cannot change them, they just *are*.

"I feel very sorry for you, i went through similar. 
I was sexually abused by one of my best friends who I knew since I was 6 and was in a relationship with my sister since I was 14. And I was in an abusive relationship with a sociopath. While in this relationship I told my sister what happened and she didn‘t believe me, went on a hating campaign against me and cut all contact. 
They both died within 3 months. My ex around a week after my sisters birthday and hers around a week after by birthday. 
I felt devastated. I grieved for both. I felt this freedom. I felt bad for grieving. I felt bad for feeling free. 
But I saw it as a sign. I got a new life, free from abuse. I look after myself better than ever. I‘m not able to work but I have my healthy routines all day long. On very bad days I learned to accept my feeling. And on bad days I take the sign of my new life as a motivation to always do my best to be happy to salute to my new life.

It's been a couple of years since I worked the job but it causing me some issues now in my personal life. I worked with the Nova Scotia medical examiners office in Canada for almost 2 years. With a company that was contracted to do dead body removals. I randomly and other times it's triggered by food ( like hamburger being made in a factory)  or something graphic on the TV. But I've become distant from fishing whish is a passion of mine, family members, friends, work, and now it's caused my engagement to be called off. And my girl and I are taking an extended break until I'm able to speak to someone and get my emotions in order. She's been wanting me to speak to someone for years and ignored her pleas thinking I was strong enough and that this couldn't possibly happen to me. Sometimes it is completely ramdom other times when I drive past an area where I picked up a dead body I snap to that moment and I can see everything plain as day. I can still smell the things I smelt. See the things I seen and even feel the fucked up things I felt. Idk if I'm making this post to vent or to ask for help or what but here it is anyways.

Im gonna Trigger warn for SA/R***  just in case. 

So i get these peroids where i question myself over situations that i end up in/get myself into. Its probably my own fault. But i'm still questioning myself even after 3yrs. People have told me this situation was in fact sexual assault/r***/coercion but i guess i just can see it/admit it at times. 

So i meet a guy outside of work, we swap numbers, message for a while and end up setting up a coffee date. 

While in public he seems genuine/nice etc, he buys the coffees etc. We chat have a laugh. I offer him a lift home because im a people pleaser. He invites me in for more coffee/futher chatting....i know im a naive idiot. 

Now i don't remember any real intimancy during the date and the conversation turns to sex. I explain that thats not something i do on a first date. He starts talking about how its just sex and its more about respecting the person. I'm still uncomfortable and attempt to leave his flat but he locks his door. He is bigger than me, taller heavier set. I don't really remember how our clothes were off and he was attempting to have sex with me, there no foreplay from what i can remember. Now i have vaginisum so he can't get fully in despite multiple attempts then he stops and goes to shower. I try to explain the medical issue i have and he doesn't really listen but i am able to leave and get out as fast as i can. 

Now idiot that i am don't report it, don't tell anyone becuase i feel like i got myself in that situation and was stupid. I did an STD home test and was fine so i just put to the back of my mind went home and continued to work. I didn't think about it really until last year when CSA stuff came up and realised that this had had an impact on me aswell. But i jokely explained the situation at the time to a work collegue and she was like 'do we need to talk about this?' At the time i didn't think it was an issue but this has stuck in my head even now. 

Now im attempting to process things in therapy and wonder if i should have forght harder or said something. I kinda just went along with it at the time and i don't think i actually gave consent and this really bothers me. Why do people do this and leave us questioning ourselves. 

Is this just a result of a childhood where you had to listen unless you wanted to be yelled at/hurt or manipulated to doing what people tell you. Or a results of being groomed/assaulted as a child and my parents not noticing warning signs?. 

Sorry for the long post i think im just looking for validation. Was this coercion? Or was i just stupid?"	exploding_pingu	post	14.395567728947002	male	White	0.038391392678022385	na	na	na	2	ptsd	no prediction.

"Hello, 

Will keep it brief. I’m an abduction survivor. I’m going to New York City for a sold out show in a venue that holds 3,000. I’m very tense when walking past people on the sidewalk. So you can imagine I’m doing a lot of work to feel comfortable in a venue a size I’ve never been in. 

I lost healthcare and I’m self employed so I don’t have a specialist to ask about this. Is there some universal badge, arm band or patch that lets people know I have PTSD and approach me carefully? 

I live in central Midwest outside of downtown, and struggle with passive aggressive people in the neighborhood often because I don’t want to look or be approached when I’m walking. I’m looking to lessen this issue.

"When I try to explain ADHD and neurodivergence to my husband he just will not hear me. When I try to explain that sometimes I ""lash out"" and it's just a PTSD reaction he seems to get upset. He says, ""Well, I never abused you"" or ""You seem just fine to me"" but that's only because I've been hiding it so well for like 25 years. Sometimes his sheer ignorance triggers me. Why can't he accept that I'm broken. We've been together 13 years and I am only now starting to work through my troubles. I am also taking ketamine therapy which he gets so angry about, he tells me how much he hates the medicine and that it has made me mean. I can admit I've definitely been moody, but I'm not sure if it's a direct side effect or just my feelings inside being worked through. I can't find any good therapists or doctors with my communtiy health insurance plan. So I'm kind of doing this on my own. I've been in and out of the mental health system since age 16, I'm now 40 and have been riding it around and around like a horrible carnival ride finding no real help or solution to my problems. I'm trying the EMDR thing on my own and I think it opened up something terrible the other day. I woke up in the morning and it was so strange. It's hard to explain but it was like my husband was someone who abused me and I was freaking out on him. I came out of it after about half the day was spent sobbing, screaming and cursing. I felt embarrassed, it wasn't me.  I'm just lost at this point because he associates ketamine with a rave drug and even though it doesn't make me feel high he's just dead against it.

I hate to say it but a lot of doctors look at that shit like you’re crazy and honestly that’s why I let my psychiatrist go. He put me on trazadone and then seroquel for sleep issues due to ptsd.

At the end of the day, it's up to you of course. I would say go ahead and try it, and if you find it's too much and you're not ready, you don't have to continue. 

For me personally? One of my main trauma responses is dissociation, so it's actually been difficult to go deep enough to trigger me much. So in that sense it's been kind of *too* easy for me... but I do think my brain finally feels safe enough with my T to really start getting into it now, judging by my last session. It was intense, but nothing I couldn't handle. =]"	Lilypad244	reply	na	na	na	0.011859365738928318	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"It's normal to not want to feel traumatic feelings.  That's part of the diagnosis of PTSD which is called avoidance.  If we didn't have avoidance in some form we wouldn't have PTSD.  

When the patient is read to begin treatment, the EMDR process is to first establish a positive resource that's used throughout the treatment.  That would be done first.  Then in a later session you attempt to process a mildly disturbing memory.  Then between sessions you noticed how that affected you.  If you're ok with that you would try a more disturbing memory.  So you don't jump into the deep end, it's gradual.  And you have the positive resource."	Lilypad244	reply	na	na	na	0.011859365738928318	no	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
I was terrified too but focused on trust building with the therapist first before trying the first time. It is quite intense but I also notice it is helping me. I have talked about things in EMDR I never told anyone else before and was even able to tell my spouse some stuff without falling apart. This has been decades of silence being undone with EMDR and it’s kind of amazing. Just make sure you have downtime after a session- lots of calming and comforting stuff because it can be exhausting. Good luck with it all, go at your own pace and be kind to yourself.	Lilypad244	reply	na	na	na	0.011859365738928318	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

It is hard. Honestly it's been harder for me because my relationship has been toxic. But if I didn't have that going on I feel like I would have been farther in it and feeling better.

"I had a therapist do intensive EMDR sessions with me a few months ago. Two days, 3 hours each. 
I had a little experience with EMDR prior to that and it wasn’t pleasant. I had shared this with my therapist I did the intensive with. The first day was good but after the second day, I felt horrible.
My entire process seemed to reverse. I shared it with my therapist but she didn’t really seem to offer any suggestions of what to do about that. It kept getting worse, so I stopped seeing her a couple of months after the EMDR intensive. 
I have an even more dislike of EMDR now and feel like the three therapists I’ve tried it with have been either uncaring or uninformed of how to help me with the negative emotions it brings up yet continue to promote it.

It’s hard work for sure, but if you’ve done talk therapy before, I’d say it’s only slightly harder than that. My therapist did two weeks of prep work with me to make sure we had coping techniques in place in case things got too intense, and of all the sessions we did, I only needed to back off and stop once. I also had my first session planned for a time when my husband could drive me home just for some extra support. It’s hard, but it’s worth it.

It’s not that bad at all. U should try virtual EMDR online if u can afford it for a month. Expect to cry alot initially. All u have to do is use the eye movement tool and u can use your own music or the sound in headphones. Remember the memory as u watch the eye movement tool and it will help process things. U don’t really need to be guided thru. Just bring up the trauma in your mind as u watch the movement tool and listen to the bilateral sound or music that triggers past memories. U can also use the eye movement tool to incorporate positive affirmations to stick better. Reparenting things u can say to yourself as u watch the eye movement tool. They even have different sequence so your eyes can go in a figure 8, diagonal, side to side, up and down which imitates REM sleep and why it seems to work. What ends up happening is eventually after u do it like several sessions, u stop having the emotional pain around the memory. Or u aren’t ruminating and having intrusive thoughts about the traumatic event anymore.	Lilypad244	reply	na	na	na	0.011859365738928318	weak	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"The only way out, is through. 

After a year of EMDR, I can tell you it is absolutely worth the effort. Your therapist will help you isolate a traumatic memory and together you tackle one memory at a time. 

You do feel it, but it's one small bite at a time, not an overwhelming flood of your painful past. At the end of each session you'll feel the pain less than you did and won't be as triggered by that memory.

It reminds me of a tattoo cover up. It hurts, and you may be a bit tender afterwards, but it changes the way you view that part of yourself moving forward. 💜"	Lilypad244	reply	na	na	na	0.011859365738928318	weak	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
From experience, it gets hard at times when you have to work through painful memories and experiences. But like other people are saying here, a good therapist who knows you well will be able to assess the appropriate pace and manner in which to do EMDR. Personally, I don’t do EMDR for every therapy session because it can be very emotionally and physically draining—which my therapist has notified me about each time we do EMDR. She always asks if I’m comfortable to “move forward” at certain points in an EMDR session. But also from experience, it has been TREMENDOUSLY helpful in the healing process! It can get hard at times, but being reminded that you’re in a safe place with a safe person (therapist) that will not let you “fall over the edge” or into a spiral is so essential. At least for me. I definitely recommend doing it! But you can also be apart of controlling what pace you are comfortable with moving at and talk with your therapist about everything you’re feeling apprehensive or encouraged about💓	Lilypad244	reply	na	na	na	0.011859365738928318	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

Your therapist will guide you through it, you don’t have to worry. My therapist advised me against driving after it and I fully agree, there where sessions after which I couldn’t drive properly.

Though Idk which type of dissociation you experience. Mine is more the derealization type, and I only start ""zoning out"" completely when my brain has had enough.

Regardless, I would say you should absolutely give it a try! If it's slow going, that's fine. I'm pretty sure my T said at some point that even with full blown dissociating most emdr Ts can work with that. =]"	Lilypad244	reply	na	na	na	0.011859365738928318	no	strong	strong	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"How can we help you call the help line?

The reason why its difficult is because then you have to feel those feelings. You know... The ones you have been burying in every nook and cranny you have. You are safe to feel those things. Some stranger on a helpline will not judge you, they will just try to direct you to care. I promise that's it.

They might not even be able to really help you, but they will try, so there's no risk. You don't have to feel everything and you won't lose anything either.Acceptance is hard, but you are strong as fuck, look what you've made it through, you can accept this and you can improve.

"The same reason why I almost scrolled right past this post... because I know but at the same time I don't know. Or I don't know but it feels familiar.
Because, I procrastinate leaving my house when it's time to pick up my refill of anxiety medication, because I am too anxious.
Because I wouldn't be able to answer my phone, no matter who, just a year ago..  especially for medical appointments. At the time, I knew those appointments were important and time sensitive (I had contracted Hep C from my lifestyle and that lifestyle was killing me- I was an addict and at the time was very bad alcoholic) I think just having that knowledge, most people would use it as personal motivation and give up the drugs, start working out, eating right, counting their steps, etc... but for me, I avoided so many things that turned into the person I am today. And the person I am today is NEVER satisfied with the present moment. Not to mention, I'm unhealthy. I ignored phone calls from friends (this was in 2013, I don't have friends anymore today), I ignored calls from my landlords while I was in the hospital, I ended up getting evicted from there which resulted in more homelessness. And I ignored calls from medical professionals, it seems I never felt worthy enough to get help. And only just now am I finally getting things dealt with, I have graves disease now because almost 10 years ago is when my thyroid levels came back too high. I think, for me, it's cognitive dissonance and the many types of ' catastrophic thinking' i.e, ""I've tried that so many times and every time I fail, so I'm not even going to try"" , snowball effect thinking....

Hi everyone, I am working on improving my sleep schedule: going to bed and waking-up at the same time. Total amount of sleep 7.5 hours uninterrupted and no medical history of sleep apnea.

I can relate to this. I’ve had quite a few blood tests etc. to rule out any other causes for the day fatigue despite getting enough sleep at night. My naps are usually at inconvenient times (say after 2pm) and last roughly 2-2.5hrs. I was told to try keep the naps to maximum 30mins so I tried setting alarms but I just feel super groggy and it’s hard to wake up after such a short nap. I’m on flouxetine medication for my depression which is apparently more a stimulant than a sedative.

"I strongly relate, unfortunately. I was homeless for a while, and I *should* know better, but I just feel the impulse to spend and buy shit that I really don't need.

Impulsive spending can be a way to find stimulation (like with ADHD), or to temporarily distract from anxiety. It helps to reflect and see what exactly this behavior is doing for you, in both the positive and negative sense. Then you can find some strategies to help prevent yourself from doing it.

One thing that helps me, is waiting 10 days before making any non-essential purchases. I'll write down what I want or save it in an Amazon wishlist. Usually during the cool-off period, the novelty wears off, and I'm no longer interested later on. 

Also, keeping your money in places where it's harder to access. I have multiple debit cards that are kind of a pain to use, and I just put my ""spending money"" there.

"I'm new to this page.  I'm a paramedic who's been battling PTSD.  I'm 50 years old and been in EMS for 30 years.  I've been battling PTSD for many years and used sex and porn to cope. The other day I had a really bad run.  The patient was dying from respiratory failure/CHF.  I made the call to RSI him
(Put him to sleep to place a advance airway in.  Just like surgery). After doing that I couldn't get him intubated and has to use our back up airway.  We had trouble doing that also. During this the patient went into cardiac arrest.   I was able to get him back 6 mins later.  After getting him back I noticed his eye was swollen shut.  In 30 years of EMS I've never seen anything like this.  When we areived at the hospital, the doctor said it was from collapsed lung.  I should have done a chest decompression (put a needle in his chest to release air) You normally would see this in the neck or chest,not the eye.  On top of this we have a newer boss who thinks he's the world's greatest paramedic along with our training officer.   I'm afraid I'm going to lose my job when I only have 650 shifts to go until retirement.   I take my meds everyday for my PTSD but I just had another major breakdown.  I've went back to watching lot of porn since this and thinking of sex non stop.  When I get to this point I would cheat on my wife in a second, Not because I didn't love her.  Sex is my way to cope.

"I've had a little bit of this since I was a kid but it's killing me now. I don't know if it's tied to trauma (prolonged violence in the family).  

I noticed at the age of 15 that I started spiraling with extreme guilt. My parents got me a painting set for Christmas and I had to go to the bathroom and bawl my eyes out. I felt so bad and didn't know why. They should be happy tears but it feels like someone is CRUSHING my heart, especially when they're scared that I won't like it. 

My parents were very strict when it came to boys. I (16) was kissing a boy and then cried for hours afterwards. 

Now the guilt becomes extra irrational with time. I keep thinking back to my past. A time where mother got into an argument with my dad and she got upset and threw something at the wall. This will make me cry now. 

I can't sleep; crying thinking about things that NEVER HAPPENED. Scenarios that feel very real. Whenever I'm having a happy moment with someone, I feel heartbroken and I don't get why. I start to just feel so hurt. 

Sometimes it feels like I'm carrying the guilt that someone else is lacking. Like I'm my dad hurt my sister, I'd feel bad as if I'm the one who did it. 

I don't speak when I'm upset. Even if it needs to be said. Even if it's true. Because I know I'll hurt later. I let people walk all over me because I don't want to feel guilty later on. Someone could abuse ME and I'll feel bad for them. Don't want them to get into trouble. 

It's ruining me"	very_autistic_potato	post	10.005792061717788	female	White	0.9975857734680176	na	na	na	4	ptsd	no prediction.
"I really really relate to this because I spent my entire childhood, teenager years and early adulthood telling people I felt so ""guilty"" and no one ever understand what I meant when I said I felt guilty.

**First things first, there is a good chance you are experiencing shame and not guilt.**

* Guilt = I did something bad
* Shame = I *am* bad (at my core/as a person)

I am NOT saying that you're a bad person, but its likely you are experiencing shame in some way because that's often a feeling that survivors of childhood abuse experience.

Feeling extreme ""guilt"" because your parents gave you a present - this sounds more like shame. It sounds like for some reason you believe you dont deserve this present because there is some inherently ""undeserving"" quality about you. Sadly many kids who experience trauma believe they are worthless :(

**Secondly, a lot of what you are describing sounds like poor boundaries, codependence, and enmeshment.**

Its almost impossible to come out of a violent or traumatic childhood unscathed and one of the most common thing that survivors usually develop is very very very poor boundaries.

Having unhealthy boundaries means:

1. you feel EVERYTHING that everyone around you feels
2. you feel personally responsible for the feelings of everyone around you.

You mom got in an argument with your dad? You feel guilty and responsible for your moms feelings.

Your dad hurt your sister? You feel guilty and responsible for your sisters feelings.

As you said in your post someone could abuse YOU and you'd feel bad for them. 

I know you logically know neither of these things are your fault - but the reason you feel guilty/responsible is because you dont have strong boundaries :(

Strong boundaries are really hard but its a skill you can learn over time.

I used to feel just like you and after going to therapy I really dont feel ANY guilty anymore. I dont feel responsible for the feelings of people around me and my heart is so much lighter. 

Taking on the pain of other people does nothing to help them, and it only hurts you. I wish I could fast forward time for you :( **it took me so so long to learn this lesson and I wish I could now just hand it to you gift wrapped!**"	very_autistic_potato	reply	na	na	na	0.9975857734680176	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
The person on the top explained it well. What we feel is shame, not guilt. I felt a lot of it. Ptsd makes us dissociate so in the beginning we can’t process the trauma because we avoid it. So our understanding of what happened to us is connected to the coping mechanisms to survive. So I used to think that it was my fault what happened to me because it was easier than realizing I had a piece of shit as a father who neglected me and did not care for me.	very_autistic_potato	reply	na	na	na	0.9975857734680176	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
You're a beautiful person, thank you for this. I wasn't abused directly but witnessing violence in my family and having my emotions and reactions belittled ruined me. The memories keep creeping in and I can't handle it. I feel so much pain for my family. I definitely don't have any boundaries. I'll feel guilty whenever I set them. I think back to times where my sister needed me because she was trying to recover from an abusive relationship and I wasn't there for her. It kills me, so now I set absolutely no boundaries between me and her. Even though I feel trapped with her. Just can't do it.	very_autistic_potato	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9975857734680176	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"Witnessing violence is enough. Think about first responders such as firefighters or EMTs - they are almost expected to get PTSD even though they are “only” witnessing violence and tragedy. 

Yes setting boundaries is so so difficult. The only thing I can say is that it’s like a muscle and it gets stronger each time you practice using it. It gets easier and feels better over time. I remember feeling JUST like you, it sucks!! I felt so selfish every tiny boundary i tried to set. 

One thing that really helped me was realizing that when I set boundaries for myself- i am giving permission to the people around me to do the same for THEMSELVES (this will be difficulty in your family of origin if you all has bad boundaries but it’s a great way to attract healthier friends/community as an adult) 

Whenever I would set a boundary for myself and put my own needs first, i would actively encourage and give permission for others to do the same. An example would be like saying no to someone asking me to do them a favor: 

My friend: Hey, do you think you could come over after work and help me study for my
exam. I always do so much better when someone quizzes me with flash cards and i’m so scared i’m gonna fail! 

Me: Oh man honestly I am so exhausted and I could really use some alone time after work today to decompress. I feel so appreciated that you thought of me but my social battery is totally drained. I hope you understand and please let me know if you ever need alone time too! 

This might seem like a really easy example but notice how I didn’t make up an excuse or a lie - the truth is that I was just tired and wanted to be alone. And my needs (wanting to decompress and be alone) are just as valid as their needs (wanting a study buddy). 

The more time you spend around people who with healthy boundaries who are able to say no, the more you will feel comfortable saying no as well. 

**Healthy boundaries encourage everyone to give and take without guilt tripping or manipulation.** 

They feel so much better than acting out of obligation and it also feels better asking others for favors when we know they are comfortable saying no to us! 

Keep practicing and start small. By valuing yourself and your own needs, you give permission for others to do the same- that’s a gift!"	very_autistic_potato	reply	na	na	na	0.9975857734680176	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"I'm 18 years old and fresh out of highschool. I have ptsd stemming from a bunch of events in my childhood (if you could call up to just 2 years ago my childhood) and if relevant I'll talk some more about it.

I'm in a healthy relationship, I've got a job and I'm saving money to buy a car. as far as all things go I'm doing ok for myself I think.
 I work nights and my paranoia is getting too intense for me. I've almost had to pull over while I was driving before because I thought I was going to die. my nightmares are worse, I'm getting aggressive again when I had it under control. I spend a good portion of my time staring at doors. 
it was easier for a bit while I moved in with my partner, but it's taking a toll on our relationship. we've had problems with some of my symptoms before, I can't be alone at their house, I can't be in front of their parents, I couldn't perform tasks in front of any of them, etc. I just don't think I could do it anymore if they left and I can't lose all that progress.

"I’ve thrown up and had heartburn from stress since I was about five years old. I threw up almost daily at some points in my life.

I recently realized that I subconsciously never even expected to make it to this age ... I was assaulted on a few different occasions and abused at a fairly young age, and that probably made me feel like I wouldn't last. I lasted longer than I thought ... but I am not seeing that as some sort of uplifting victory. I am still dealing with the same old internal crap, but now I just feel old, more worn out than ever, and with a long track record of trying and failing, trying and failing, trying and failing.

"Very well said.  

Very specific experiences in your thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and relationships.  

As someone who moved through very similar experiences, and now helps people help themselves through the same things, that’s specific to them, this is one of the best descriptions of what it collectively feels like…to move through it.

I understand and accept that just venting usually means you are “coping, not escaping”.  That’s one of the first assessments and interventions that makes all the difference when moving through it all. Because you are less likely to choose to be stuck in that space on uncertainty or states of frozen fear, like trauma can do to its victims. Biologically.  Psychologically. And Sociologically.

This Life is almost like a cross-country trip in a suped-up or beat down vehicle of your design and choosing.  Along the way we enjoy the vehicle or loathe the vehicle,  and either bond or clash with it just like the sights and people along the way.  But once we arrive to the destination and the people we met fade into memories like the scenery, we turn in that rental vehicle too, and carry on.

I was just saying yesterday morning about how many people who are in role-related relationships can sometimes be more focused on fulfilling that role and being accepted by others without really caring or even considering how it makes you or others feel.  Like transactional only.  That’s how I understand what you mean when you said people only love the idea of relationships and culture for how it makes them feel, like a wedding ceremony being the highlight and motivation for a marriage. 

It took me from about 15-38 years old to realize that at the foundation of me continuing to live was for my mother and younger brother, to keep from having to witness the vision I witnessed when I vividly saw them “react” to my death by suicide at 15.  Even after degrees and various levels of material and incorporeal success, it’s like I was on obligation autopilot and didn’t realize it until I did over 20 years later.

But I moved through it and now it’s like I am finally understanding and building a relationship with myself, who I am, and who I am motivated to be.  Without judging or condemning myself or anyone else with a person-centered balance of “grace & accountability” (The CCH Approach).  But still drawing emotionally intelligent boundaries between the different dimensions of myself, and the role-related behaviors I choose to take on during this brief road trip through this Life time.

It sounds like you are experienced at a soul level and as a human.  I feel like the reason you keep going is because you choose to.  And the summary of all summaries that I accept and offer up to those I serve when it’s appropriate, is that: 

“Life will give us every opportunity to say yes.  And every opportunity to say no.  That way, we will be sure that what we choose will be exactly what we want.  Based on who we truly are.  And who we aspire to be.”

Personally, that’s what I feel is the ultimate purpose of everything happening in every dimension of space and time that births and harbors Lifeforms.

I am wishing you the best on your travels upward and onward. 😊"	ClassicSuspicious968	reply	na	na	na	0.9990422129631042	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

We like to pretend guns are terrifying as fuck but they are.

Also, I want to point out that this was yesterday. You do not have ptsd (from this event I mean)- rather are experiencing human emotions (there is a diagnosis for this if you meet the same criteria though but I firmly believe it’s for billing purposes lol and because it helps with treatment plans)- as that needs a month of specific criteria, and talking about the trauma/situation, getting support, and taking care of yourself and validating your feelings are big factors in NOT developing ptsd.

"I have my med card for it. It helps.  I could be smoking the super high thc stuff from the dispensaries and getting blasted but, all the flower I vape is high CBD , low THC hemp flower I buy from farms online. That ratio helps me far more. 

I use the dispensary stuff to help me sleep, of course. ;)

I talked to my therapist at length before I got my card. She talked to my psychiatrist. I did it all above board. They were both a-ok with it. That was almost two years ago and it’s going well. It’s still helping and I’ve made so much progress from where I was.

A caveat. It doesn’t work for everyone. And you have to try a lot of strains to find what works. Dont buy shitty flower. Go to /r/hempflowers and do your research.  If you don’t want to smoke, don’t. Buy a vaporizer. I recommend an Arizer Airmax. It’s a solid vape made by a reputable company.  It’s dead easy to use and clean. It has great flavor and an all glass airpath.

for what it's worth. CBD has no real harmful effects and has never been described as habituating as far as I've heard.

20 years ago I would read papers about CBD and mental illness. CBD could not be found anywhere. I wasn't sure if I'd ever live to be able to try it. Fuck the war on drugs. Shit doesn't even get you high."	PsychoticArtist_1	reply	na	na	na	0.011704464443027973	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"Hello Community, 

I was diagnosed with CPTSD recently, while I was in inpatient therapy I could talk with people experiencing similar symptoms like me. So maybe you could help me out here. :) 

Because, the  kind of symptoms I have barely got mentioned in the official handbook, I would like ask for some Ideas. 

For example my goldfiahbrain barely get mebtioned but it is such a common thing around people who experienced severe trauma. (Memory issues,  concentration issues )

Right now I'm just suffering under phenomena where I fell helpless with and which was always the biggest issue for me. SENSORY ISSUES, hypersensitivity for too much socializing, noise, feeling cold. I would compare it with autistic overloads, where your brain gets foggy, slight headache, your body is under tension, skin is ""itchy"" and every goddam noise makes it worse like a pin needle in your brain. 

I could cry, scream hit a wall, scratch my skin bloody and everything at once and just disappear under a blanket, but sometimes this ain't an option. So does someone else here, with PTSD has this kind of problem? 

Things I already tried, lavender oil, valerian tee, trying tips from the neurodivergent communities like sunglasses and ear protection, fidgets (skills like stress ball, small soft plushie) 

Do you know if this is kind of a flashback or just a general trauma issue? Which tricks besides of pills could help? Does it get better someday?"	Tipsypanhandler	post	21.59272847835566	female	White	0.9969125986099243	na	na	na	2	ptsd	no prediction.
I experience a lot of the sensory issues too. I think what’s helped lessen the hypersensitivity for me has been medication (flouxentine) and doing yoga regularly. Although not ‘cures’, they have helped lessen the sensitivity to noise and light. My memory is still not great and the brain fog hits hard some days, but i’m learning to just accept it and work around those. Buy a motorbike if you can. It’s the best therapy and distraction from life’s problems in my opinion!	Tipsypanhandler	reply	na	na	na	0.9969125986099243	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"Thanks I, and you're pretty lucky that meds are helping you, everytime the docs tried meds on me my health gets worse. 

I also can't afford a motorcycle but bicycling calms me also a lot. I found out that this hobby thing can be a big skill, making yourself a nice introvert/nerdy headspace for crafting, crocheting reading and a big mug of tasty herbal tea. Or as you mentioned outdoor sports"	Tipsypanhandler	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9969125986099243	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"Since I’ve never really had to personally deal with it, I always just thought PTSD was something people in the military got. Damn was I wrong. After a brutal domestic attack a few years ago I felt lucky to be alive so when symptoms of PTSD started to arise I didn’t connect them at all because I always just assumed in order to get it you had to see combat. When flashbacks and dreams started flooding my world I started abusing my adderall prescription. It took awhile for me to even be conscious of the fact that I was abusing it because I wasn’t taking it to get high it was to stay awake and keep my mind from straying. I started staying up for days at a time. It didn’t take long for me to “hallucinate” crazy situations that I to this day remember like they were real. I became so paranoid and convinced myself I had schizophrenia. I believe this for a long time, but I thought I could hide it until people started noticing I was acting very odd. I knew I needed to do something about it but instead of going to a doctor, I want to google and spent my days and nights reading about all kinds of different mental illnesses. Then I will go to Reddit to get personal experiences. It took about 6 months of this for me to realize I probably had PTSD from the tramayic event. I’m honestly ready to seek help but after reading that a lot of people were accidentally diagnosed with schizophrenia anyways what’s there to stop a doctor from doing the same thing to me. I don’t want to be medicated incorrectly cause I already know that’s going to push me back down the hole I’ve managed to start climbing. 
I’d also like to note that I’ve worked very hard to quit abusing my adderall because they did for a lot of years before I abused them. I’ve been slowly trying to lower my tolerance and I’ve actually made progress but I’m afraid if I ever tell a doctor I abused them they are going to take them forever. If I told this to a consular are they allowed to tell my doctor?"	_user_name_username	post	29.358405720434444	male	White	0.9841482639312744	na	na	na	1	ptsd	no prediction.

yes and although my therapist and i are working through learning to identify behaviours caused by PTSD it gets really annoying that quite literally my entire personality  is based off my trauma. like “oh i don’t want to work with that person because i think they hate me (but that’s just because my brain doesn’t work properly because of my trauma)”. like it’s good to identify buuuut then it kinda feels like it rules my life	Ashyy69	reply	na	na	na	0.9910474419593811	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"I underestimate it infront of people, dismiss it. overlook to forget it ever happened or to forget what it did to me, what it's still doing to me. I always tell myself it's over but it's still alive and running. It lives with me and I don't think it's ever leaving. I still see traces of it everywhere, yet I undermine the incident which still breaks me.

"Hey guys,  so July 2nd is when this happened I will not be giving any names for anonymity sake, but it all started when me and my group of 8 other friends wanted to go tubing on the lake we were staying at. Our group of friends is very close and we pretty much always love being around eachother. I'll call one of my friends Tyler for the story, Tyler's parents are the beach house owners they actually own two properties on this lake. Iv known Tyler for around 20 years now (I'm currently 24 years old) so since we were kids, and my other very close friend I'll call Evan. I have also known him since we were like 4 as well. Me Tyler and Evan have all been friends our entire lives pretty much and we have been up to this lake house a few times. This year we brought several of our other friends along Tyler's girlfriend which I will call Mable, me and Mable are also very good friends I love that bitch, lol. And also another good friend I will call Alan. There are several other people along up with us but it's not quite as important. So one day we decided to go tubing and Alan and Mable decided to get on the tube, the boat we are riding is a speed boat with 285 horse power and an in board motor with a very large propeller. We hadn't realized how much Tyler's dad had to drink (turns out it was alot) but we didn't really know that and he starts tubing with us and them in the tube. Our entire friend group ison this boat so 8 people on the boat and Alan and Mable on the tube so 10 total, the speed boat is already pretty cramped. So after about 5 minutes of riding he's really trying to whip them off at this point so he turns sharp right then back left and at this point we see the tube come up parallel with the left side of the boat, and the dad still hasn't seen this yet but we almost sorta yell a bit and he slows down more then turns left and they come up infront of the boat then he sped up a bit, I can see as they go under the front of the boat, we felt the boat hit them as Alan stuck his arm up over himself and Mable to try and save them from head injuries. They go under and come out the other side going through the propeller which we didn't know yet and we are all speechless for a moment, until they come out of the water a bit away from us and Alan screams ""my leg"" I started to see a big pool of red around them and one of our other friends jumped in the water right away I almost froze up but I could see there injuries as we got them close to the boat. In the moment I knew I was going to have to be one of the ones to help cause I'm stronger than everyone in our group but I knew I'd have to listen to my close friend Evan because he is in the army and has Some medic classes under his belt. When they were still in the water we could see it was bad so me and Evan had to move some friends out of the way and several others had to stay back cause they couldn't handle the sight, me and Evan slowly brought Mable into the boat, her left arm was cut in 5 places 4 under her forearm about 60% of the way through it then one right above her elbow about 80-90% of the way through her arm, and her side was cut in 3 places one was all the way from her breast to her hip, it cut through all of her ribs and she lost her spleen and had bad damage to a kidney, so Evan immediately started to apply a turnakit to Mables arm, at this point we were both already covered in blood, while he was doing that i went over to grab my other great friend Alan who had 2 cuts below his knee on the left leg one went right through and severed his tibial artery so he was bleeding out fast, and the other was a large cut next to his calf which severed his bone in several spots, I brought him up in the boat myself cause Mable needed attention from Evan. I got Alan in the boat and swapped to hold mables side while Evan applied a turnakit to Alan, cause mables organs were spilling out of her side so we had to keep them in. I was just doing whatever I had to do and listening to Evan to make sure we could save our close friends lives. Acting on pure instinct and following all orders, at this point the drunk dad was just being a hindrance saying things like no don't call 911 or leave them alone they are fine, as we are literally covered in their blood. Just being a complete piece of shit. We obviously ignored him and I called 911 a bit ago and had Tyler tell them where to go cause I didn't know since this was his families lake area. So Tyler gets his dad out of the driver seat and starts to drive us to the boat launch which was amazing of him cause no one knew where to go besides him and his drunk idiot dad ans tyler is by far the worst with blood in our group even a tiny cut gets him a bit. . At this point I'm holding Alan who is no longer bleeding but he's sorta fading consciousness but also making jokes about is as I try to keep him awake a bit while Evan is holding onto Mable making sure she stays awake while talking to her but the whole time I have eye contact with Mable to give her something to stare at and see. I can see the life slowly fading from her face and eyes as her face is completely white, lips are blue, it looks like her eyes were having trouble staying open as her eye lashes fluttered but Evan did a good job asking her questions and making sure she stayed conscious.  Which she did, we got to the boat launch and within about 3 minutes the ambulances and police arrived. Most of our friends on the boat are panicking at this point but me and Alan knew we had to stay calm and be the rocks for our friends. So the EMTs get to the boat on the dock and aren't taking it seriously at all.  We tell them Mable is priority one but the can't get to her very well even tho they easily could've from what I remember. Even Alan was like hey guys she's priority one get her first. Which didn't happen. Then even tho there were 5 fucking EMTs on sight. I ended up lifting and putting Alan into the first stretcher literally by myself. After that they finally started to get Mable and at this point it was just me Mable the dad and Evan in the boat and as they started to bring Mable out of the boat onto the dock, they dropped the side with her head.. luckily Evan reacted and caught her head last second but the force of the drop still caused mables organs to spill out of her side and for her to scream which me and Evan saw all of this happen.It looked like her arm was just gonna fall off it was dangling by some skin and a bit of her bisep and his leg was dangling on barely as well. After everything we later got a call saying that they were both stable and going to live. Which was the biggest relief of my life. And they both get to keep there limbs as well. And will regain most mobility with them but not all feeling back... im just relieved to be talking to them and hanging out with them alot and now I can say I helped save 2 lives. But man Iv had bad PTSD and nightmares and issues with boats and I'm struggling with it all pretty bad even with therapy. This is a real story and I do struggle with it along with all my other friends but atleast we have eachother."

"I am a 23 year old male. For the past 3 years I've been dealing with Emotional Blunting. I can no longer feel pleasure, adrenaline, euphoria, anxiety, etc. My emotions are numb both positive and negative. I also noticed I lost my ability to feel a stress response. I no longer feel adrenaline rushes when I am in adrenaline inducing situations. I no longer get the sensation of my heart beating out of my chest. I can't feel my heart pounding. It's like my stress response has been muted. It's like my body and brain has become desensitized to stress.

In addition to the Emotional Blunting I also developed Sexual Dysfunction. I lost my libido. I can no longer feel sexual desire, attraction, thoughts, etc. I developed erectile dysfunction. I no longer wake up in the morning with an erection or get random erections. I also developed reduced sensation to my penis.

The Emotional Blunting and the Sexual Dysfunction have been the most bothersome symptoms, but other symptoms I developed are: A loss of appetite, brain fog, and muscle tension.

These symptoms began 3 years ago after I went through an episode of intense stress, anxiety, and depression. My body and brain were constantly in fight or flight mode then all of a sudden it was like my body and brain couldn't take it anymore and everything just shut down, and things haven't been the same since."

So I have ptsd from a car accident that happened a few years ago. This has caused me to not be able to drive in the dark because it took place at night. When I do drive at night I have episodes. I just recently got promoted at my job to be a manager and I’m looking for a place to rent. I know there will be nights where I’ll have to get home late because I’m a manager now. I really don’t know what to do. I’ve looked into getting a place close by to rent but my partner wants to live in a bus. I wouldn’t mind living in a bus honestly because home could be anywhere. I’m just so stressed out about finding a place close to work. Does anyone else have this issue?	kittygirlsparkles	post	25.445411736082757	female	White	0.9986339211463928	na	na	na	3	ptsd	no prediction.
I had two really bad experiences, in all brainspotting and EMDR made a huge difference. The goal is to process trauma and I had a really bad day in my car to which nothing worked until I found some legit therapy and now driving is back to where I was before the issue. Point being yes I have had issues that are like yours thar I was able to overcome through brainspotting and EMDR.	kittygirlsparkles	reply	na	na	na	0.9986339211463928	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

Any ideas about this ? 

Got it after 2 months of no contract.  



Hi (@##)  ! I just wanted to tell you what was going on and not ghost you. I found your old messages and finally opened up to some people about what happened in this relationship. I think it only could exist because of my own trauma that said I didn't deserve better and I mistook empathy for love and such, and I'm still treating these wounds and hope to never meet you again. So, I will just say that I have and had a crazy amount of empathy for you and that I wish you all the best and know you will get that.

It was emotional violence that you did, and you crossed my sexual boundaries more than once, I know you didn't mean to most of the time, and you are working on these patterns, but the work wasn't enough. The push and pull dynamic was because I wanted to fix it and make it go away, but it only made it worse. Since it's my own trauma, I will not pull again .

Update:
I might be venting, but here's the situation: I consider myself a very simple person, and I'm expressing my concerns here because I want to make sure that I am not a ""monster ""as my inner voice telling me so . I feel guilty after reading the message, as if it was intended for someone else and I was an easy target or a manifestation of along history of bad ex's  

Regarding the sexual abuse aspect, we had a normal sexual life where she was into BDSM, had a history with fetish parties, and engaged in sexual behaviour in that context. Since I'm not into BDSM (but have nothing against it), I tried some things she said she liked, and she never told me to stop or voiced any concerns. I wasn't aware of what went wrong until later. I was shocked because I received positive feedback all the time, but I still apologized and didn't argue.

As for the emotional abuse, I believe it was related to my social media behavior, where my Instagram feed included some women (whom I don't know personally, but that's how the algorithm works). This made her jealous, and she emotionally withdrew, which led to me spending a lot of energy trying to mend things. On the other hand, she posted a picture of herself in a pole dancing suit (as she is a pole dancer).

She also became jealous of my ex-girlfriend, who visited me during a period of psychiatric quarantine following a suicidal attempt. However, she herself invited me to a musical concert where her ex was playing, which I found out about later.

The main reason for our breakup was that I didn't want her to dance in a fetish party, but she went ahead and did it anyway. So, I told her we were done and asked her not to contact me again. Despite that, she kept texting me, and we had an on-and-off relationship filled with accusations and guilt trips until I decided to stop texting altogether. This led to us ghosting each other for two months until I received this message."	Historical-Series-36	post	22.612204842811234	female	White	0.9962136149406433	na	na	na	23	ptsd	no prediction.
"You're asking our ideas about it?

**If we take it at face value, it sounds like you may have emotionally and sexually abused whoever sent this to you.** Regardless if you intended to or not, it seems this person believes you abused them in these two ways. 

It also sounds like this person seems to care about you and isn't trying to hurt you, so they are hoping you can learn from this experience. It also sounds like this person has no interest in continuing the abusive dynamic.

"I think there a few key take aways. 

1) you hurt them, and without being there, im taking the “victims” side. You were emotionally abusive and sexually, you need to acknowledge your actions. You need to grow and heal for real. I recommend therapy. 

2) don’t respond. The person don’t want a response, they are telling you you fucked up and are trying to save your future partners. You still have time to learn and grow. 

3) you thought this was a good idea to post on a PTSD subreddit? Sorry man, but it wasn’t. I have PTSD from relationship abuse, there was no way I was going to read that and feel sorry for you. Even though a part of me knows that the message could be fabricated and manipulative, without any mention of that, I can’t have empathy. You got a slap to the face, kiss your wounds, and learn."

"TW in this response for slight DV references. 

Ok everyone two things can be true at once. Maybe OP has ptsd and trauma and is in this group for support. And maybe OP has also behaved in an abusive way toward their ex and their ex sent this for closure. 

People with untreated PTSD often abuse others due to violent outbursts or other symptoms, or not understanding how boundaries work, etc. (How many of us have been abused by our parents who clearly had untreated ptsd? I know I have. Also my ex husband was a cop so same thing there.) 

OP, I this this is a great opportunity for you to reflect with your therapist about boundaries and the role you cause in perpetuating others’ trauma and what in your own life may have caused you to act in this way. And maybe this is a good opportunity for you to be thankful for your ex’s empathy and harness some of that into empathy for yourself so you can treat your own issues. 

Please don’t respond to your ex, and let your ex continue healing, and use this as an opportunity to grow and heal yourself and learn how to be in a healthy relationship."	Historical-Series-36	reply	na	na	na	0.9962136149406433	no	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"I disagree. The text reminds me of a narcissist looking for a fix; reached out, slung mud, and slammed the door on the way out. 

They were radio silent for two months then came back with some vague word salad about boundaries, ""emotional violence,"" and what could be read as an accusation of sexual assault. There was no attempt to educate.

"That provides some important context that would be important for people reading to consider. Sounds like some boundaries could have been better communicated on both sides. It also kind of sounds like you are minimizing. You state you had a “normal” sexual life but really there is no normal.  What’s important is that both/all parties are consenting and comfortable and enjoying themselves. Also you may want to look up what constitutes emotional abuse and see if anything looks familiar for the dynamic in the relationship. 

Sometimes with BDSM everything is fine until it isn’t, and if you have a freeze trauma response to whatever is going on you can’t really communicate it in the moment.

(That’s happened to me before. I’ve used BDSM as a way to cope with trauma.  And then guess what I ended up letting things go too far and ended up re-traumatizing myself by not communicating because I was panicking.)
 
It sounds like this relationship was toxic and traumatic for you both and that you may have been traumatized by other relationships in the past. It’s so important to address that trauma and heal from it and learn how to set and enforce (and respect) boundaries in romantic relationships. It’s possible it just takes a lot of inner work. 

Those are my ideas/thoughts. Please update your post or otherwise respond if you have any specific questions. Personally I’m not really sure what input you’re hoping for as you just asked for ideas/thoughts. Are you unsure if you should respond?"

"I don't know but some people maybe want to show people they did nothing wrong by posting something even though they may be wrong...🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️

But the violation of boundaries mentioned in the text is pretty serious, I mean how many people would say that when it didn't happen? 
It can be that the person had already been abused that way and so maybe the person of the text tried setting boundaries but maybe not in a very still or secure voice because when someone has traumas they try telling people about their boundaries and/or triggers but it could be that she didn't know whether it was just her trauma or if she really wasn't fine with it (anyway I am not invalidating the person of the text in any way! I am trying to say how she could have felt). But if she knew and set boundaries then she knew what she was fine with and what not. I mean not many people would accuse someone of what's in the text. Not without a reason unless money were involved. Then of course we can say maybe she and him or they had different experiences and ideas about the matter, but what she said is very important. There are many things in a couple that can cause disagreements but in those cases and in those about respect especially physical safety the boundaries should be taken as very important. Even insults/bad words should not be there at least the very horrible ones but what she said in the text...

I think it either was that he didn't think what he was doing was bad or he thought he was being good at it or that she couldn't set boundaries as she would have liked etc. Or, although I don't want to defend OP if the text is real (since I believe it could be real!) maybe he even tried to respect the boundaries but for some reason failed...or he didn't try at all and she thought he tried to but failed ????? But still, I can't defend OP after what's in the text, as that's a very serious accusation. 

Anyway if there's no reason related to money I don't think they would say so without a valid reason. 

I've heard many things in my life, but never someone accusing someone of what the person in the text did without a valid reason (but of course money and divorce at times...but it's not everyday case scenario). Even for some sort of defense against something bad they wanna do, but it would probably be if there were worse reasons under that accusation...and many times maybe in law houses brrrrr. I just mean that accusation is really serious, not many people use it unless in a court house for money or defense against worse things...or to threaten someone too like they'll tell about that if bla bla bla.

It's like someone posting a post saying the SO complained about physical violence. 

(I actually had a friend complaining in a relationship that he had been left but he admitted that he argued with her not to be left etc) 

Also please know English isn't my first language and, I just like to understand the human mind.

Edit: even if someone wants money back for having been hurt, if actually they had really been hurt that way then the claim would still be right. Same for divorce if what happened really happened."	Historical-Series-36	reply	na	na	na	0.9962136149406433	no	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"Perhaps I'm jaded, but ""violating boundaries"" & ""emotional violence"" could be literally anything that hurt someone's feelings or caused regret; especially when mental health issues collide with BDSM (OP's active communities).

BDSM, when viewed out of context, absolutely should be assumed to be abuse.  With context, it doesn't make OP an abuser. At this point, I do believe that OP has knowingly omitted certain details that would clarify the situation, in a bid for attention.

I didn't look through his profile but the text he posted didn't specify anything although I didn't think she referred to BDSM? I mean wouldn't the message sound different then? Also what do you know that she had the same likings like him and that they had that same inclination? Anyway, maybe as we don't know more it's not the case to keep on discussing.

"I assume a lot of you can relate to the rage you have inside of you to the person who traumatized you and brought you to this state of ptsd, and i would life to hear how do you cope with this?
Ever since I've got ptsd, i have an enormous amout of anger in me, and i really don't like it. 

I don't blow up on people or something, the anger is really repressed, but i still feel it almost all of the time. 

For a few years now, whenever i think about this man, i try to consult myself and say to myself that when he dies, i will just pee on his grave or something (i know this isn't the most healthy thing in the world, but this thought did keep me away from wanting to do more serious actions).

But, i recently saw that he wrote a post about something, and a lot of my acquaintances shared it and praised him for what he wrote (some political thing), and gave him a lot of compliments about his 'character'.

It wasn't a significant event, but from when I've seen it, i kinda lost it. I feel very bad that someone who ruined years for me (obviously I'm not over it, but i was reeally not over it for like 3 years) is viewed as a good man by a lot of people that i do like and value, and I don't know how to cope with all of this.

I just woke up in The middle of the night and started crying thinking about it, and I don't like that at all. I don't want to be angry, but i can't really let go of that. I try to remind myself that I love the person I've become after dealing with my problems for the last 5 years, but it's really hard letting go of what happend.

How do you deal with feelings like this?"	yuvalbuium	post	26.390522371009922	male	White	0.9964820146560669	na	na	na	38	ptsd	no prediction.

I have found that when my ptsd anger comes creeping up I go to my truck and blare the stereo and/or go for a drive while jamming out. It’s my therapy time. I’ve somewhat forgiven the person and their actions which gave me the ptsd and that’s helped a little but depending on each individual’s situation I know forgiveness can be very difficult. I also collect firearms. When I’m feeling that anger I go out and shoot targets. There’s just some sort of a “release” I get from dumping a load of bullets at the targets. Also, lifting weights has helped me channel that negative energy into something positive. Don’t let your anger win. Don’t make any decisions while angry. When I get into an angry mood I tell my husband and kids “hey, I’m really feeling a lot of anger and irritability right now so I’m going to go have some quiet time and need to be alone, don’t take it personal”. Meditation has also helped. Ptsd is no joke and people just don’t get it unless they’ve been diagnosed too. Don’t be mad at them. They just don’t understand. Someone also mentioned a punching bag. I’ve done that a few times too and man it feels great.	yuvalbuium	reply	na	na	na	0.9964820146560669	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"Remind yourself that it’s okay to be angry because its fucked up that humans abuse other humans. What helps me is remembering that this is an experience many people have. When I feel overwhelming and paralyzing anger at the sexual abuse I endured and how this person is now famous and successful for his perceived “character” (which is fucking fake.), I remember how many other women and men have experienced this, and I feel the pain of everyone. I grieve for everyone. And I send love and healing to everyone who has ever felt this way. You are not alone, even if it feels like it. I’m sending love to you, and I’m sorry you have to experience this too.

I also remind myself that the emptiness and sadness he made me feel may be but a glimpse into the emptiness and sadness he experiences all of the time, because how else could you possibly treat someone this way.

How I dealt with it and I hope you read this : I removed the person from my life and everyone that enabled my trauma.That’s the only way. If the person is in your family or coworker or circle of acquaintances You need to never speak with the family members or find another job or another circle of friends. Remove that person from your life and EVERYONE that was involved negatively in your trauma. I said everyone. If someone was negligent and that caused your trauma, if someone did not believe you and minimized your suffering, everyone that is involved negatively in this. Its very important to never speak again with these people. It’s the only way you will have peace. Trust me. I dealt with anger for many years I was so angry it consumed me. What you need to do is to Block and leave behind everyone involved negatively in your traumatic experience.

"I think it's okay to express anger privately in a safe space so that you don't repress it

But - I don't think it's personally okay to express anger towards others during conversations

My reason is - if you can't calmly speak about something or control your own emotion in the heat of the moment then that person or relationship isn't for you

People are allowed to be hurt, upset, and angry -- yet not every emotion should be expressed around others due to the lack of safety that it will provide for the other party

The other concern with anger is that it is something that can quickly turn from broodiness and resentment into physical harassment and violence if you don't have that restraint within yourself

Furthermore - anger in my opinion is not an actual conducive emotion that can help safely progress a relationship or resolve an issue between parties

So it's okay to feel anger privately in your own contained safe space, but I think that we have a responsibility to control our anger around others so that we can ensure that they are safe"	yuvalbuium	reply	na	na	na	0.9964820146560669	no	no	no	na	ptsd	failed

"When I was 16 I was in a sexually abusive relationship with a guy we will call X. He repeatedly coerced me to engage in sex, I was weak and would just do what he asked but afterwards I would tell him how much I didn't like it. He had a history of getting too close physically with girls and feminine presenting people. He coerced a trans guy who had just taken his sleeping meds to send him nudes. When our relationship ended I found out he had coerced the only friend I felt I had into sexual acts. I told people what he did to me, he convinced them that I lied about everything and I received hate messages. X still lost a lot of friends over this incident. X then spread rumors that someone was going to physically attack me. A year or so later a saw a friend of a friend was friends with X, I messaged them about my experience with X as I felt an obligation to warn them about who he was. I was informed by them that X talked about being hospitalized because of having murderous thoughts about me. 

I'm 22 now I've made a lot of progress in therapy, I have significantly less flashbacks and panic attacks now. I used to keep tabs on X out of fear I'd run into him or that he would try to attack me, thankfully I have never seen him in person since ending the relationship. Over time I kept track of him less and less. There has been a slight influx in flashbacks from X lately and I've been struggling with insomnia for the last several weeks. I don't know what struck me about tonight, but I looked at his social media. He's married. 
I've always hoped he would grow and be a better person, I know it is not my responsibility to keep other from pain. I just have this sick twisted feeling, god do I hope he is not abusing his partner.

I don’t know how to help, but I have a really similar story. When I was 14 my abuser did something similar, coercing me into sex and introduced me to the BDSM world. I’m not in a spot to go into details, but I kept tabs on him for a while to make sure he was as far away from me as possible. I recently saw that he’s married and has a daughter. His wife looks like me even. Same hair, same body type, it’s weird. I get the ickiest feeling seeing them. What happened to me was a long time ago (I’m 26 now, so 12 years), but from what I’ve heard he didn’t change much. Part of me wants to warn her, but I can’t make myself get back into any situation that involves him.

I used to keep tabs on him too so I could try to avoid him but even seeing his name or face is a trigger for me so I can’t do that to myself anymore.

"I am M44, a father of 4 children whom I love deeply, a wife who has always stood by me, with whom I’ve been for 17 years, my own business, no debts, and overall - I’m living quite well. |

And this is my story…

I had a difficult childhood. I experienced a complete spectrum of traumas - everything one can imagine. My father committed suicide when I was 4 years old; I hardly remember him except for glimpses of domestic disputes and scenes filled with drama and alcoholism. Each ” family ” member believed I would grow up to be a delinquent. And so, I carried this stigma throughout my life, until the moment I reached a higher level of self-awareness and began to work through these traumas. When it was time for me to go to school, my grandparents wanted to enroll me in the same class as my cousin, but my aunt, who was a teacher at the school, decided that “such a person as [my name]” couldn’t join that class. After all, it was the elite class.

Later, my mother got involved with “uncles.” First with the biggest troublemaker in town - the same story repeated - arguments, her being beaten, her hair pulled, incidents like hiding and pouring out bottles of alcohol, the fear of coming home. And I, am a little scared in the midst of this hell. Then another one, always nice at the beginning, but after a few months, the same pattern emerged: drinking, arguments, domestic violence.

We had one type living with us for a while who rented a room, and when I was 8 years old I was sexually molested. my mother was in the room next door she even let him take me to himself.

I don’t remember anyone ever standing up for me except for my grandfather and uncle (not to mention, a heavy drinker, but a fantastic person with what you could call a rational mind, who in a way, became my second real father).

I remember being left alone at home while my mother visited friends. Several times, in the middle of the night, I would walk around the town to that friend’s house, looking for her because I was afraid of being left alone.

One time, when I was in high school, I remember our neighbor, who was a teacher, coming into my house and yelling at me in front of my mother, humiliating me because I refused to carry his books home. My mother just stood there and didn’t react at all.

There have been many stories like these, which can be traced back to a common denominator - that no one among those who should have, stood up for me. As a result, I’ve struggled with an incredibly low sense of self-worth and a belief that I am worthless. This conviction has permeated every aspect of my life - relationships, work, sexuality, and achievements. Even seemingly trivial matters, such as not allowing myself to buy a new car because I don’t believe I deserve it, and I spent years enduring an old car that constantly broke down. Can you believe it?

After years of these experiences and being trapped in these patterns, I turned to psychedelics, which revealed to me the mechanics behind these situations. In brief (since the entire story involving them could fill a book), over the course of 3 years, I worked through my traumas with the help of various substances. I can confidently say that this form of self-therapy works 100%. However, what still pains me is that despite my mother’s claims that she “loves me,” and that I’m her “beloved son,” I don’t feel that “love” at all. I have the impression that I’m entirely unnecessary when I visit her. It seems she never truly listens to me and remains disinterested in my life - I’m simply expected to give money and leave. She also tends to bring up personal matters in front of others, unintentionally humiliating me in the process.

Furthermore, she consistently prioritizes others’ interests over her own and those of her own children. Every time I return from visiting her, I feel down for a few days. Whenever I attempt to discuss this past with her, she avoids and evades the subject. While I understand I cannot change the past, I long to hear her say, even just once, that she “regrets not defending me and apologizes.”

I’ve spent a long time contemplating all of this, and I believe that cutting off contact completely would be the best course of action.

I’m interested in knowing if anyone has had similar experiences, especially within their relationships with close family members, and how they managed those challenges.

"Yes. 
Cut my mom off for a year. Best year ever.

She lived with me for 5 years and only 3 weeks ago went into an assisted living facility because I moved across the country. 

I have come to know and understand that I will never be enough for her and that’s more about HER and the trauma she endured in her life than it has to do with me. I also know I will never get an apology/she will never understand what she did/how she made me feel. Doesn’t make it suck any less though.

I feel like I need to get this off my chest.
I was officially diagnosed with PTSD almost 3 years ago- my psych just put PTSD on my file, but I'm 99% sure it's complex PTSD, as I've experienced numerous traumas from childhood to now- lots of trauma. I have experienced mainly emotional trauma from abandonment, to neglect, emotional abuse, narcissistic abuse, bullying- and other forms of trauma I'm not quite comfy discussing yet. 

I have gone to a few different therapists and have tried different types of therapy. 
Talk therapy just wasn't enough, and my therapy appts. felt more like ""getting coffee with a friend""
emdr, honestly didn't feel helpful. And the appointments ended up being extremely emotionally exhausting. Not healing. I also didn't connect with the therapist and felt like I could never fully open up to her.
I had one therapist back in 2017 who I loved and adored and had to stop seeing bc she wasn't on my health insurance. 
Well last year, i found out that she was on my new insurance. So I started seeing her again, and things were going well and we were pretty much starting at the beginning of the trauma.
I only got a few appointments in when she told me she had cancer and that she was not going to continue working. 

So at this point I've had to start over again and again with different therapists, and it's now almost traumatizing to even think about going to a new therapist because I have to start over once again and it feels like I just have to relive all that trauma from day 1 again and again because I've never been able to fully process ANYTHING. And what if I don't connect with them? 

I've hit a point with my PTSD where I am emotionally numb, disconnected, and also very easily overstimulated and always on guard. I don't feel connected to anyone in my life anymore, and I don't feel the desire to reach out. I never want to leave my house, and nothing makes me feel excited anymore. I don't feel suicidal, but I am consistently wondering what the point is. Like I feel so robotic. I feel like I'm so used to bad shit happening to me that now my body's way of preparing for impact is just shutting down completely. I have general anxiety every day(more often than ever, now), but I don't cry anymore. I used to cry a lot. I'll cry during a sad movie, but when it comes to my own damn life, I just..never cry. I just don't feel anything. 

A year ago I found out my parter was emotionally cheating on me, and lying/hiding things from me. I married this person, and in doing so, felt like that traumatic cycle of life was finally over, so to find out all that, it just sent me spiraling completely. I had a full on mental breakdown and cried for HOURS straight on numerous days. The following weeks were spent experiencing an intense level of anxiety I had never experienced before- and OCD symptoms.

Since then, everything just feels different. I don't feel like me. I feel so shut down, and dettatched from everything. I also feel completely avoidant of MOST things. I've started to get body pains with no explanation, and I experience fatigue more often than not.

I am still married, and I would like to work through this seeing as my partner has made adjustments and efforts to fix things, however I feel like my trauma is now completely blocking any path to resolution.


I need to get into therapy, but I feel like at this point I need some heavy, intense, wild therapy shit and I just don't even know what to do.
I feel like it's never going to get any better, and I feel like I am stuck in this cycle of emotional trauma. Like maybe I'm just destined to consistently experience abandonment, or heartbreak, or emotional abuse, neglect etc. Because it's like I can't go a whole year without something extremely traumatizing happening, and I just want it to stop. :("	Remarkable_Chip_806	post	22.07307964002131	female	White	0.9972641468048096	na	na	na	5	ptsd	no prediction.
"According to my therapist it is likely I've been suffering from CPTSD.  I've had horrific nightmares and flashbacks for many years.  CPTSD typically has more severe and persistent symptoms of PTSD (flasbacks/nightmares, avoidance, hypervigilance) than the PTSD diagnosis.  It also has 3 additional symptoms.   It's also important to remember there are many diagnosis' that can result from trauma.  CPTSD is just of many and has a specific set of symptoms as they all do. There may be multiple diagnosis as well.

I can tell yes it's very possible to get better.  I've made major progress, so much that the re-experiencing is infrequent now.  The other PTSD symptoms of hypervigilance and avoidance are reduced as well.  I feel much better than I used to, I'm not in a living hell like I was.

Here is an accurate description of CPTSD

"It will get better. 

It sounds like you've been through hell and back a couple times now and are now going through something very hard again. It also sounds like you're an incredibly strong person, none of these experiences have defeated you and this one won't either. I'm hesitant to give you direct advice because I'm not a professional, so I'll try and keep it general. Therapy would definitely be beneficial, perhaps explore checking yourself into a facility if that's a feasible option for you, it sounds scary but it might be a good option. Keep searching for a therapist, do your research and go into the first session with a prepared list of questions and expectations, this will help you determine if the person will be a good fit. 

PTSD is a life long battle but it can become manageable with proper treatment and effort. You're clearly articulate and seem to know how to express yourself well, this will help in learning to manage your PTSD. Take the steps, they are hard to take but it's worth it.

I did EMDR and it changed my life, the severe re-experiencing in nightmares is infrequent now, and when it does happen it's not as severe.  I used to have them every day, waking up screaming and marks on my body.  Also I use regulating  tools on my own daily, see a therapist weekly, and get support from people.

you can google it, there are also many Youtube Videos about it :) You have to practice it a little bit by saying multiple times a day „Oh I have 5 fingers“ and look at them. After a few days or week doing that, you will do it in a dream and in that moment, you realize that you dream. And when you realize that, you can control the dream. It’s only an example.

"I've gone through several complex traumas in my life that I won't disclose, but I've noticed a pattern in my behavior where I completely disassociate my childhood from who I am now and say that I was a totally different person then, almost to a literal extent, disowning that entire part of my life and my past. There might be a healthy way to do that, and I want to let go, but I know this isn't the way to do that. I villainize and view my child self as a horrible monster that doesn't deserve acknowledgement, love, or recognition. 

I don't want to do that anymore, I'm tired of trauma blocking massive chunks of my life, but I don't even know what this trauma response is or how to shake it.

"I'm not certain, but it could be what's generically known as ""dissociation"". I have Complex PTSD from childhood issues and have struggled with what I've referred to as ""multiple personalities lite"", as my personae are not fully distinct with no recollection or knowledge of each other, but they're quite unique and separate, and often at odds with each other. The host of the Traumatized Motherfuckers podcast describes it as ""Fragmented Personalities"", and I think that captures it quite well for me."

I’ve also heard it called splitting. And my therapist calls our work on that “integration”, “parts work” and/or “inner child work”. I think those can be different thing.

Have you heard of Internal Family Systems therapy? It’s about understanding that we are all made up of different parts and for trauma folks it can make us feel a lot of internal conflict. It can really help to identify what motivates a part and understand that there are no bad parts, they all want the best for you in their own way.

Not saying what is in your childhood makes it impossible for anyone to give you a realistic, viable, response. Not anything you'd be able to relate to. Just random streams of consciousness, none of which will match your issue.  But if you were a bad kid, did bad things, and now as an adult you feel bad and want or gone, then you definitely need to confess the things you did. If crimes, go to the police.  Let them decide if you should be charged. Likely not. Even murder and rape is different when you were a child and now as an adult confessing it you'd be treated as a victim.  May need to go into an institution for a while, not jail. But still should go to the police ASAP.  If moral issues, go to your local church. But if it was things that were done to you then you have no reason at all to feel bad about yourself because you had no control over any of it, no matter how bad.  Sometimes therapy is not the answer, but an elder or a priest is always a great choice. But if only a term is what you want then you already named it. You are a cognitive dissociative.  All persons with childhood trauma are. Some just hide it from themselves.	AFlowerInTheDarkness	reply	na	na	na	0.9981414079666138	no	no	no	na	ptsd	failed
…this isn’t something everyone does?? I totally see the person I was during the trauma, and a few years after (though my therapist has said that everything that happened after was traumatic in its own way) as a completely different person.

"I do this too and I bring it up in therapy sometimes.

She always reminds me when I'm like that (back then) ""you're not a cat, you're a human, and one day, you'll realize that"" or (now) ""you're not literally a different person than you were a year ago; you're still the same [my name]"" and though it annoys me it does help :)

"I had a bit of a similar experience, I had a trauma happen to me at 1 years old and the same thing at 3 years old and have no memory of it at all. Something happened to me my freshman year of high school that kicked all my ptsd symptoms into high gear. I struggled a lot and lost a lot of my friends, they all thought I was overreacting or attention seeking. My therapist thought I had PTSD but couldn't diagnose it without a traumatic event. When I was officially diagnosed I felt so much relief because finally my feelings were validated. Once I started to heal from everything I was in my senior year of high school and I felt like I really missed out on my high school experience due to all my mental health issues. Being out of high school has been amazing though, going to college and working jobs I've found fulfilling is far better than trying to fix my terrible high school experience. 

I'm not sure how helpful any of my words may have been. It can be hard to move on when your body is constantly trying to process the trauma. Life does go on. Putting in work to move on makes a difference, I'm in EMDR therapy which has been really helpful. With EMDR it is not necessary to remember the trauma if you can't remember, it focuses on releasing the feelings from your body and reminding your brain that you are physically safe and no longer experiencing the trauma."

"I find that I am re-learning things from before my trauma, and remembering learning it the first time. Lately, I have been venturing out of my comfort zone a lot more. To work on my personal issues, that I would like to change for my own quality of life. I'm trying to pretend to be the person that I want to be, because I have heard lately that is a way to become the person you want to become. I tend to be spiritual, and follow signs. This is the direction the universe is pointing me towards, so I am following my path. 

One of my biggest blocks is being social, and talking to others. Looking people in the eyes. I keep remembering being 16 y.o. (I'm currently 42 y.o.), and trying to be social because I wanted to fit in. I keep thinking, I knew all of this back in the day, and my trauma seriously made me unlearn it all. 

But, now no one can take the knowledge away from me, I hope. My brain chemistry has changed drastically for the last time, hopefully. Hopefully, hopefully, hopefully. Lol Just something weird I noticed, and just wondering if you all get the same memories, and how it makes you feel.

I feel like the challenge to your own personal foundational beliefs and identity including an awakening, self reflective awareness from trauma means that your look on life and everything around it has to be relearnt. It’s all coming from a new angle/perspective. The old habitual familiar ways don’t sit right anymore, and you have to lean into the unfamiliar to progress. Sort of an regression of self education in your progression in life. Also what your brain could do at 16 and what it can do at 42 is very different in availability. In someways you are wiser in particular things and thinking.	schoolgrrl	reply	na	na	na	0.001972316764295101	no	no	no	na	ptsd	failed

"TW

&#x200B;

To summarize things as I don’t want to trigger myself, I was in the hospital for a high heart rate (hitting 190 at one point) almost two years ago, and then other time over Covid, I also lost my dad and had to watch him in the hospital over the course of a month before he died when I was 10, I think his heart rate was also very high, but elaborating a bit more on what happened at the hospital during my time, they tried to use medicine through an iv, didn’t work, they tried to stop my heart using this medicine which I recall made my legs very heavy, the medicine is called adenosine, they tried it three times, then they talked about even shocking my heart, it ended up going down on its own, I remember being in a lot of pain that day and my mom ended up crying and everything else (due to the experience with my father it was very hard on her and me), ever since I’ve experienced intense anxiety around my heart rate, avoiding hospitals, having panic attacks and flashbacks, tons of nightmares over it, a couple times I’d constantly check my heart rate, I have developed what I think is white coat syndrome, I can’t handle the sounds of monitors or handle seeing anything hospital related even on tv without it sending me into a panic attack or triggering flash backs. but everyone makes me feel so weak and stupid for dealing with this, saying it isn’t that traumatic basically… could this be ptsd?

It is difficult for anyone here to say if you have PTSD or not, as that would require a clinical assessment of symptoms, onset etc. With that said, we can be affected by many things, without it necessarily being ptsd. PTSD is a disorder based on certain symptoms developing after a potentially traumatic event, but not having those symptoms doesn’t necessarily mean that the event wasn’t horrifying, or that we are not heavily impacted in other ways. It sounds to me like the experience when your father died have taken quite a toll on you, and that you might consider talking to someone professional about that event, no matter if you suffer from PTSD or not. I’d also like to point out that other mental disorders can develop after potentially traumatic events aswell, and that not developing ptsd but rather developing anxiety disorders or affective disorders doesn’t mean that the event was insignificant.

Disagree with other commenter. The T in PTSD is trauma-tic, right? Medical definition of trauma= an event that was shocking or terrifying to the person, without adequate witnesses and support afterwards to process what happened. Left untreated along enough it can def turn into PTSD. It’s not about what happened, it’s about what happened (or didn’t happen) after. Learned this from actual MDs such as Peter Levine.

"I wouldn't call that small.  I don't think you're weak.  PTSD is when you have flashbacks/nightmares, hypervigilance and avoidance.   

I know people tend to not see what they experienced as being that bad.  Part of that is society's conditioning but also a way the mind tries to protect us.  Part of healing is when we start to se that it was really bad.  It may take time to get there, but from what you wrote, to me that is not small at all."

"I feel like I'm too far behind other people to the point where I can't make meaningful real life connections. I don't know pretty much anything about pop culture, so the subjects people talk about are completely alien to me. 
There's also not much to talk about when it comes to my life. There are very few things worth recalling, so most of it I can't remember.

I've been living all my life in a strange and unsafe alternative reality — a world forged by individuals whose goals consisted of making me fear everything and isolating me so I wouldn't question their beliefs — and I've only been able to break out of it recently. 

I've always spent a lot of time on the internet, in an attempt to distance myself from that reality, so it'd be safe to assume that I'd be able to connect with people there but such is not the case. I've always been an observer and, despite the effort to change that, I still get panic attacks when interacting with people.

I worry that I don't have anything worth saying or that I can't come up with acceptable responses, so I end up doing nothing.
Not doing anything further alienates me from the stuff normal people do and hinders future interactions creating a feedback loop.
It's miserable. 

And I do try to work on myself. I go out for hiking trails tens of miles long and it makes me feel really good, but then I'm reminded of how much more awesome it'd to do the same with other people and I get kinda sad.
It's like everything I do is just an attempt to mask an inherently miserable life with an illusion of momentary happiness and I can't seem to use that little happiness to build a foundation for a better future.

It's really great you have found solace in hiking. My mom really enjoyed kayaking but didn't have anyone to do it with. She found local Facebook groups where people would organize to meet up for a kayaking activity, I'm sure they have similar groups for hiking.

"My little brother ran away from our abusive bio parents a few months back and has been staying with a friend ever sense. I've been living with our grandparents for the past few years now. Recently my brother came to me and said he finally feels comfortable enough to move in with me and my grandparents. I talked with him about it and he got really excited by the idea of coming to live with us.
He's thirteen and I'm five years older than him. Me and him were super close growing up until we got separated two years ago. Unfortunately both of us struggle with intense ptsd and mental health issues. He unfortunately turned to smoking weed to cope with it 
( which ik sucks at such a young age but honestly with everything we went through, I can't blame him much)

My grandparents are super supportive with him moving in. But there's one issue. They are NOT okay with him smoking. I don't know if they fully understand that he does it to cope and not just to have a fun time. 
So if he moves in they don't want him smoking at all. Anyone with an addiction would quickly see an issue with this, considering it's next to impossible to quit cold turkey. 

Here comes my moral dilemma. Would it be a bad idea for me to encourage him to simply lie and hide it from my grandparents so he has a stable place to stay? The place he lives at rn is okay but they struggle with money and in turn don't really have a lot of food or money for clothing at stuff like that. He also just really misses living with family and says his current situation makes him feel like he doesn't have a true home. 

Would it be a bad idea for me to help him cover up his addiction in order to get him moved in?? I want him to have access to the medical care and councelling he needs which he is absolutely not going to get were he is currently staying"	Connor_XT	post	19.590749839536063	female	White	0.005921792704612017	na	na	na	13	ptsd	failed
You could offer the grandparents a change in perspective. Try to tell them that he is using it as medicine, not recreationally. Do some research and set up a document that explains the medical benefits of marijuana, cross research everything, and cite several sources for each piece of information. Our elders grew up in a time where weed was used as a recreational drug primarily, and due to the illegal nature of it in most places, it tended to lead towards more criminal behavior, especially given the misinformational narrative around it. Educate them and see what they think afterwards.	Connor_XT	reply	na	na	na	0.005921792704612017	no	no	no	na	ptsd	failed
To answer your actual question, if it were me then yes, I'd cover for him in order to get him moved in and secure. Absolutely. And I'd take the heat when the grandparents inevitably find out.

This is a really tough call. Would it feel authentic to tell him that medical care and therapy could include medication that is researched for 13 year olds to help him cope?

"You're being pretty heavy and judgemental.  Keep in mind that over half the US has legalized cannabis for medical purposes, including trauma and ptsd. Being condescending and judgemental isn't any better for him than where he is. If you want to come to terms with this and bring him into the grandparents house then lay the rules out up front. Having been in the younger kids shoes myself I suggest starting by reminding him that the grandparents don't approve of smoking, at all, and he doesn't have a medical card.  He can't smoke in or near the house. He can't come in reeking with bloodshot eyes and eat the contents of the refrigerator or a week of groceries at a time.  
State behavioral expectations, such as: always be on time, clean and attentive at school home and church of that's important to the grandparents. Respect the fact that these are older people with limited incomes. He needs to respect the sacrifice they're offering to make to keep him safe and off the streets. School has to come first. 
If he has money for weed he has money for breath mints and visine.  
Don't cover for him.
Support him emotionally. You both need therapy. 

The most important thing he needs to keep in mind is to respect the home and people he's living with. He needs to do his chores and his homework. If his grandmother needs something done he needs to jump like he had a spring in his butt. He needs to think about how he's going to support himself as an adult and work on those goals.

Look at yourself and ask whether you're modeling behavior you learned from abusive parents when you're thinking about controlling him. He has to learn to control himself, put his future in mind.

Something like ""I don't think smoking pot is a good decision after everything we've been through. It would really upset our grandparents if they found out. Don't smoke on their property.

I hear where you're coming from there. I had a horrible growing up situation, and my parents held a similar age based attitude towards everything. Well, I did it anyway. I started smoking marijuana at 11, drinking at 12, cigarettes at 12, and that only got worse over time.

Would they be more okay with it if it was edibles, or is it the marijuana specifically just due to his age. I have kids and I understand not wanting them to be using drugs that young. But I am pro-medical marijuana. For anyone under 18, I would try other coping mechanisms first. However since he's already use to it, it would make sense to me to not make him stop cold turkey.

"I understand why you would think that.  The thing is, telling a child NO DON'T DO THAT rarely ever achieves the desired results.  I apparently didn't express the point I was trying to make.  With early teenagers, you want to model and frame the behavior you expect in a positive.  As in ""these are the expectations"" not focusing on a negative and amplifying it with recriminations.

I've raised kids through the experimental phase. The child is a victim of abuse and pot makes them feel better.  Saying ""that's bad/wrong and you have to stop"" would result in lying hiding and building a barrier to keep OP from keeping him from doing ""something that makes them feel better"". 

I clearly failed to express the reality that you get more bees with honey than vinegar.  You define the the positive successful goals and objectives they need to achieve and let them come to the conclusion if they're not meeting goals.

Most of all, everyone suffering PTSD needs supportive therapy. That's not a judgement. We're here because finding therapy is hard and we are looking for people who have experience what we have.

How do I just get used to this? I feel like even if the anxiety or  flashbacks go away and they have been less frequent, i still feel empty. Just sad, you think since my symptoms are decreasing I should feel jumping of and down kind of happy right? But I’m not feeling that, i feel awful absolutely awful.

I think my work on “radical self acceptance” got me through some of this. There’s always still grief. But now, when I have an episode, I just know that sometimes it’s ok if I’m going through the motions for the necessary things and then otherwise resting my brain and trying to balance some comfort/nurturing with some embodiment work.

"I feel like the process of adjusting to the ""new normal"" for PTSD is a lot like the death of someone you loved. Nothing is ever the same. You think of them seemingly randomly. The pain hits you whenever you're reminded of them, or whenever you remind yourself of them. You might have dreams of them. Wish you could go back and time and maybe things could've been different. You might blame yourself.


However, that said it is still quite different. You may feel a lot of fear, and avoid certain places or things. The way it effects the brain and the rest of the body is pretty specific. 


But as far as ""adjusting"" to the ""new normal"" I tend to think of it like that. The way anyone would after the death of someone they loved, generally speaking. You're never the same, but you can find a new existence."	Lilypad244	reply	na	na	na	0.9993857145309448	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
I'm 15 years into treatment and mostly in recovery, but I had a weird experience last week with a motorcyclist (my stalker, who is a serial rapist, drives a motorcycle) and I've been having a relapse. My last week felt exactly as you described. It DOES get better and you WILL feel better, but you'll also have relapses. The goal is to be able to (as another commenter suggested) accept that you'll never be 100% the same (and thank goodness because of what you've learned), but anything closer to that is better than where you've been. You're already making progress and you're already better off. Just keep going! Though, I'm also sorry you've been permanently changed. I wish none of us were! 🫂	Lilypad244	reply	na	na	na	0.9993857145309448	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
When someone has experienced a constant state of something like sadness or panic, it can feel really off putting to feel something different. There are people who will self sabotage without realizing it because they feel comfortable in the state they have been living in and it's scary to find a new normal. What you're feeling is absolutely normal. If you can try to find small tasks that bring you joy, focus on being in the present. It is uncomfortable and it will pass.

"In the fall of 2016 I was rear-ended. I had whiplash and went through 16 weeks of daily chiropractic care.

In 2018 I sought treatment from a specialized therapist, akin to a hypnotist. I think it was EMDR, but I don't know for certain. Anyway, I attended a handful of 1 hour sessions but ended up abandoning that idea shortly thereafter 

Physically I've been fine for years, but mentally I feel like I may have suppressed some of the trauma. I've been slowly reopening the wounds. 

I've become more cognizant of certain behaviors in recent weeks. I recently started leaving the nighttime dimmer switch in the 'On' position on the rearview mirror in my car so I can't see traffic immediately behind me. I've found this greatly reduces my anxiety when driving with somebody behind me. Out of sight, out of mind I guess 

I've also recently hypothesized that people who have experienced similar trauma that I have tend to drive erratically on the highway. In particular, I am referring to the act of zipping between pockets of traffic,  colloquially known as the Jersey Swerve. I obliviously have no way to prove this theory, but I figured this would be a good place to shine some light on two issues that I firmly believe to have a strong correlation 

Some of my reasoning behind this hypothesis:

1) Driving in the aforementioned manner is a fight or flight response. The idea of being boxed in with nowhere to go is agonizing. People in this predicament are looking for an out, and this often manifests itself in the form of swerving and evasive maneuvers followed by bursts of high speed


2) People tend to conflate road rage and anxiety. I've been in the car with people who drive in the manner in which I've described. I've never gotten the sense they were at all angry or filled with rage. I haven't yet consulted this individual regarding this theory, but I intend to 


3) As I understand it, many military servicemembers have similar traumas that manifest themselves in similar ways. Obviously I don't know everyone's individual circumstances, but I know that similar erratic driving behaviors are not uncommon among the abovementioned cohort. I was watching a documentary about a group of Marines battling PTSD after returning stateside. The way one of the marines described his experiences seemed eerily similar to my own. In a way, what he said resonated with me. I really should re-watch this film so I can expound on this.. 

Am I on to something here or are my theories whack? I feel very strongly there is some sort of correlation here, although admittedly I am not writing it in the most coherent way. Thoughts?"	mattied971	post	28.600280234672763	male	White	0.00717501062899828	na	na	na	1	ptsd	no prediction.

I will try to keep this as short and simple as I can, so bear with me! 🙏🏻 I am currently 25, and have been out of a job for quite some time now. I had worked in retail in the past, then eventually stuck with nannying. Over that time, I slowly developed worse and worse anxiety, which resulted in extreme panic attacks. I forced myself to continue nannying despite the attacks, and last year the lady I worked for ended up moving away. The attacks got out of control again and it has been a nightmare to try and figure out what on earth I can do! 😞 I am in the works of trying to get back to my doctor for further help with my health struggles, but am desperately in need of some form of work to be able to do so. I have been doing lots of research on different job ideas, but I still haven’t been able to find an option that would be doable in light of my circumstances. 😞 Not having a job and the living situations I’ve been stuck in are creating even more anxiety and panic in me, too. It’s all a vicious cycle that has been difficult to cope with. I’m trying not to lose the last bit of hope I have of finding work, getting better, and eventually living out on my own. Any help/ideas would be BEYOND appreciated by not only me, but also my siblings who deeply struggle as well. Thank you so much! 🥀🙏🏻	DayZgirl101	post	35.174849526553444	female	White	0.01316317543387413	na	na	na	4	ptsd	no prediction.

U can see if you can get on disability for the ptsd, I have no idea what that process looks like tho.

I’m on disability, though I don’t just have PTSD, depression and anxiety, I also have several chronic pain problems. But that is something that you could try. It was a long hard process but it was definitely worth it as it is literally impossible for me to work. And the sooner you start the process the better.

So i was watching videos on how you can unlock more repressed memories and they say being high let’s you into your subconscious more easily so I tried that.

When I’m there it all feels so real and I can see the stuff happening but once I’m out that state I get all confused again.

So one time I got high with my sisters trying to have a good time but instead I saw these horrible flashes back to my childhood of my being s/a etc by an uncle.

Two years ago i was abused which lead me to having ptsd. I know i wasn’t at fault but i still feel like i was the one who did it. During one argument, i said that I’m fine with whatever she wants but i just want to know what she wanted with me (whole argument started just because I asked her what she wanted with me) I didn’t want to be used. She made up stories in order to guilt trip me but i didn’t know this at the time. Stories that have made me realise that she’s a pathological liar. I was just extremely confused. She then said that she’s leaving the conversation and won’t say anything (which I’ve realised now is called stonewalling and silent treatment). I felt so pathetic and insane. I knew i wasn’t saying anything bad, i just wanted to know what she wanted with me. I told her that it feels like you’re a robot who’s deflecting my question. She got extremely angry at this and told me that i am scaring her. I kept saying sorry and told her that I’m just confused. I thought i was a monster because she said i scared her. She then said i should solve my confusion and that she’s leaving. I said that it’s a simple question and nothing else, and then she said in the most condescending manner, “what is your question, (my name)?”. She knew what I was asking, and she still asked this in an insulting tone. I finally got extremely frustrated and told her, “do you think i can remove my confusion at a click of a fucking button?” She got extremely angry and I apologised profusely. I had no idea what got into me. She then said that she wants nothing to do with me and that she’s leaving the conversation. I begged for forgiveness, looking pathetic. I still blame myself for this reaction. I know she was the one who made a simple question into a gaslighting argument but i still shouldn’t have used the word “fucking”. I think her slander and lies are justified because of how i used the word. I should be kinder to myself. I was only seventeen.

Absolutely not. The only thing you may have done wrong was letting your anger get the best of you a little. But not a single thing she did was justified or your fault in any way.

"Just as a small disclaimer I want to say I’m not positive if this is the right place to put this, but I feel like I need an outlet for these feelings right now. Sorry if this is unrelated to this subreddit as I haven’t been seen by a therapist for PTSD or been diagnosed with PTSD.

I was in a relationship 2 years ago with a man who I got pregnant with. I was 19 at the time, so I got an abortion. At the time it wasn’t something I wanted to do and my stay at planned parenthood was seriously traumatic. I was put under for the procedure and had an IUD implanted at the same time. I held a lot of resentment towards my boyfriend for terminating the pregnancy and I broke up with him around half a year later.

Flash forward to this week and I decided I wanted to remove my IUD as I’m not sexually active and just didn’t like the symptoms I received from the implant. I went to my insurance provider and got as far as the procedure room before I burst into uncontrollable tears and have a severe panic attack. Totally out of the blue, I’ve never done that before. A female doctor comes in and comforts me before starting the procedure, and my panic attack starts again and I’m sobbing. Once we’re done she asks me if I’m safe at home or if there’s someone hurting me. I said no but explained the circumstances pf my IUD insertion and she gave me a hug.

Now it’s two days later and I’m having severe bleeding. I call the hospital and they tell me to go to the emergency room ASAP since it’s not a normal amount of blood. I end up getting seen by an gynecologist instead and get seen by a male doctor. Today I brought in a pack of smokes and a doll to keep me calm and it was working until he put the speculum in and suddenly I’m back in that place in my head that makes me panic. I’m sobbing again and shaking and saying sorry. It was something about looking at the ceiling that triggered me both times.

I talked about these freak outs with my mom briefly, who is aware I had an abortion but I’ve never spoken to her about my experience. She said something that made me realize I might be traumatized like “what kind of trauma are you holding on to?” It made me wonder why being there was so terrifying. And each time I was done with the appointment I had this thought that I could never be with a man again, or anyone. And why the hell was I not talking about this in therapy when I could afford it?!

There were little things before that I knew to avoid for sure. I can’t watch the movies Ghost or Bride Wars because they were playing in the lobby of the PP clinic while I was in there having the worst day of my life. And I can’t stomach horror movies or video games involving fetuses or developing babies (I used to watch gamers on youtube play games like PT and Resident Evil: Village that had these themes) but that was all I knew I needed to steer clear from. Now even the kindest doctors are terrifying, and I hate that. I felt so dirty and guilty.

I guess that’s the end to the post—I just needed to vent briefly. The takeaway to this is that I am not ready to date again, and maybe not ever. I was speaking to a couple people romantically that I now know I want nothing to do with physically, the thought alone of being with someone again is so scary to me.

"It indeed sounds like trauma. Main symptoms are hyperarousal, avoidance and intrusions (flashbacks, nightmares, panic attacks). You told about at least two of those. Filling out a PCL-5 screening questionnaire and checking  your results can be a good starting point. If you get anything above 20 it is a good indicator for PTSD. Seek professional help when you get a chance. RTM protocol is a very good solution for isolated trauma you mentioned. Few sessions can make your life significantly better and help you leave your trauma in the past, not carrying it around every day.

I have a friend who used to have panic attacks at her annual OBGYN appointment due to sexual trauma. She found a very sympathetic OBGYN who gave her medication beforehand to relax her and was able to have earphones in and listen to music while she had her Pap smear done. 

I know you’re looking to vent, but I would suggest seeking for a good OBGYN now in preparation for your annual Appt. While uncomfortable, it could be beneficial to call around and see if you can find a doctor who will be sympathetic like this. Maybe post in your town’s subreddit (if it has one)?

Thank you so much. My first OBGYN was super kind and I will go back to her for my pap smear, I think I was just seriously underprepared for a freak-out and I just couldn't calm down. I'm definitely going to wear some earphones next time.

"I was at a drag show & a performer came out w/ a toy gun & gunshot noises. I started to panic, even though i knew it was fake - i could see the bedazzled toy, but i couldn’t stop it. I just panicked & had to leave. 

I miss participating in normal life. Everywhere I go - work, grocery store, movie theater, school, a fucking drag show - i’m terrified someone is going to walk in with a gun. 

I say i love you to my loved ones every time i see them, just in case I don’t come home or they don’t.

"It’s the worst when your fears are not unfounded. it’s so hard to convince yourself you are safe when you know logically, there’s a chance you’re not. 

I relate so much. 

PTSD is so weird because like you said, i can watch something triggering unfold before me and i logically KNOW it’s not the same scenario as ~my traumatic event~ but it’s just close enough that my brain *initiates trauma response* 

maybe it’s all the therapy but it’s so weird to be aware of a trigger and be cognizant of what’s happening, but still be completely unable to stop the meltdown or flashback from happening.

It sucks."	Murky-Entrepreneur62	reply	na	na	na	0.9983296990394592	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"Before I say the rest of this I want to preface with that different treatments work for different people, I don't know what works for you but maybe this will, in the end, only you & your therapist know what works for you. Adding to that, I'm from a country where guns are very strictly regulated and legally owning one is impossible for 99% of people.(though we have a huge organized crime problem and almost weekly shootings, grenade attacks etc).             
That said:                           

If your PTSD is from firearms maybe talk with your therapist about some sort of exposure therapy to do (important: when you are *ready* for it).                     
Guns and the USA at this point are so intertwined there's no escaping it. In ads, in shows, in performances, people open carrying etc.                    

Maybe, eventually again when you are ready, it's an idea to try and go to a firing range on a less busy day to put yourself on the literal other side of that firearm. To make new associations with the range instead of the cause of your PTSD.                      
Maybe follow a gun safety course, not for the purpose of owning a firearm yourself, but to get a more strictly technical understanding of it all.                        
It could help lessen the impact of the original memory and perhaps even bolster your confidence in being more familiar with guns on a strictly technical, non emotional level.                             

I understand feeling unsafe with guns around but maybe by learning about guns and going through the same courses and stuff people that legally carry do, you can build confidence both in yourself & your fellow citizens.               
Again, don't just outright do this but bring the idea up to your therapist."	Murky-Entrepreneur62	reply	na	na	na	0.9983296990394592	no	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
Personally, I actually think reacting with fight/flight is more healthy in this situation, than if you hadn’t reacted. I don’t think it should be a part of normal life to see a gun (toy or not) and hear gun shots. This is trauma. And this is collective trauma that our whole society is experiencing.

I was abused about 2 years ago. I met a new guy recently and we hit it off and yesterday we cuddled. I was driving home and just crying and feeling sick to my stomach replaying what should’ve been nice moment between us where I felt safe and loved. It’s a new relationship and he’s kind and is very respectful of boundaries, my disassociation, and mental health. But in an attempt to reclaim what was taken from me I overcompensate and I just am all over him physically. This makes me feel ashamed of myself even though he reassures me that he likes it. I don’t know how to cope with this or if I should back off until I know that he’s emotionally there. I’m like waiting for the moment where he hits me or does something so I can say to myself hey I told you this wasn’t going to be the right thing. Any advice?

"Have you been seeking trauma treatment? This is a completely normal reaction. 

I guess my advice would be to take it slow and let him know that you struggle with being close physically from what you’ve been through. It’s not something that will go away on its own though, getting treatment is essential. 

I’ve been through this too, the waiting for the other shoe to drop. It helps to take things slow and build trust over time. Also something that helped me is getting massages.  It helps me to be touched in a controlled environment.

"I was in a similar situation when I first met my fiancé. My advice is be honest with him, take your time, and trust yourself. It took me about a year to completely get over my past relationship trauma when we got together. I remember once we had sex and I had a complete breakdown in the middle, even though he didn’t really do anything wrong. It was just me, my fears, and my traumas. 

But making the realization that I now knew how to identify the things that were red flags with that previous abuse that I had gone through really helped me, and so did journaling and reflecting on that old relationship. I knew that my fiancé wasn’t abusive because I contemplated on our relationship and I saw him do things that my ex would’ve never done and in communicating with him and talking about my fears and my hesitations and those things, he really went out of his way to comfort me and to take things slow with me. One of the first things we did was establish a safe word, that we still use, five years later, and even outside of sex (like during play fighting or kissing or whatever). 

You need to give yourself some slack, you need to give yourself trust, you need to give yourself time, and you need to give this relationship the communication and the nurturing that it deserves. If you feel really like you’re really into this guy and he’s the right person for you, then he will understand and he will be the one that you need right now."

"first off: no forum is a forum for diagnosis, as noone can do proper diagnostics with you via reddit (or any other website)

that said, yes, they might be referring to trauma that could lead to cptsd. 
it sounds like they're referring simply to complex trauma; experiencing complex trauma does not mean someone will develop cptsd though.

complex trauma can lead to no trauma induced disorder, ptsd, cptsd (or other disorders).
the make up of the trauma does not necessarily define the disorder, it can be a nudge though. diagnosis mostly take into account the symptoms.

i would advise you (if you are able to do that), to ask your therapist/psychologist/psychiatrist if they can do tests for cptsd, even though they cannot officially diagnose it.
in case you do not have access to such ressources, but feel further knowledge might be helpful, reading up on the topic might be a good idea (although it might also be hard due to the self reflection without guidance of a professional)."	arctic_raspberry	reply	na	na	na	0.9844659566879272	no	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

I also don't really fully cognitively recognize how old I am and really wish I could go back to the age where the height of the trauma happened and re-do everything, because there are so much missing blank spots and I feel cheated out of a gigantic chunk of neurodevelopment.

"Yeah. The longest normal job I kept was six months. I worked with just the boss and we only seen each other once a day or so. I would have stayed there forever but when he retired his shop was shut down. Besides that I’ve never been anywhere longer than a few months. I love people but have a hard time being around them for long periods. I’m getting better at it but since a young age I’ve always started businesses.

I’ve had gum/candy machines, ran a trash route in the county with no free pick up, mowed yards, eBay, Etsy, flea market/junk flipping, made wood items and sold, picked up driftwood out of public creeks and rivers and sold. Just about a million different things. All made good money and plenty more didn’t. Just don’t spend anything you can’t lose until that business pays for it. I don’t think I would have lived as long if I didn’t find out it cost less than 50 dollars for a business license before I was 21. 

Self employment saved my life. It was scary at first and a lot of people scoff at the idea of starting a business under 150 bucks but the one I do now I started homeless with nothing but my cell phone and 40 in cash. Plus the credit I used for license. Now a few months later we have a place and my so was able to start back work as well. 

Didn’t mean go on a rant lol. But wish more people knew if you can work or even if ya can’t a public job good chance everyone’s know’s enough about something to make money off of it.

I have a doctors appointment today, I have a men’s health issue which I really need checked out (ball pain potential swelling). I just know the doctor or nurse I’m seeing is going to ask to expose myself to see them. Normally this would not be an issue but I’m going through a pretty rough bout of anxiety at the moment and my ptsd symptoms have worsened over the past month and especially the last week. I spoke to my therapist yesterday, he’s lovely don’t get me wrong but all he said was to tell the doctor that I’m nervous and use breathing techniques. Do you have any pre-emotive techniques I could use before seeing the doctors today? Music hasn’t helped, I am thinking of downloading Tetris on my phone or stardew valley, something relaxing to take my mind off things.

"I just commented something similar under another post. My female friend has some sexual trauma and has bad panic attacks at her “lady doctor” appointment every year. She found a doctor who prescribed her an anxiety medication beforehand so she could relax. Her doctor also let her listen to music during the procedure so she could get her mind off it.

It sounds like you already had your appointment, but if not, it may be worth asking for a medication before the appointment!"	Capable_Coffee_7442	reply	na	na	na	0.9981096982955933	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"My first traumatic event that actually turned into a PTSD scenario happened 3 years ago. since then 3 others happened and just tonight I got into a car accident. 

the guy was in a bike coming so fast, I couldnt see him in time. Dont want to give details because it takes me back to the moment. 
he has a wife who appeared there shortly afyer. she was so mad at me, angry, furious, and still holding their daughter in her arms. 

I later heard she saying ""i was in bed with my daughter, we were cuddling when I got the call.""

god it destroyed me. i cant fking forget her saying that. everyone looked at me with such anger. I dont think it was my fault, but now that doesnt matter because I have this stuff in my mind forever. 

so thats life? just more and more events forever trapped inside your head as the years go by?"	prtg22	post	32.657275759239965	male	White	0.9653783440589905	na	na	na	2	ptsd	no prediction.

 Life brings bad events sometimes though it is just that traumatized people perceive it differently. 
The woman you talk about was definitely in stress.

Looks like a traumatic experience. Often those wear off in a few months/years by themselves, but if not then trauma therapy can help a lot. A few sessions of RTM or EMDR can go a long way.

Yeah, it is often hard to find the right approach and proper specialist as there are many of those and they really do differ a lot.  If you didn't try RTM I would highly suggest trying it for the particular symptoms bothering you that you can track back to a particular traumatic event and if it doesn't work in 5 sessions then it may not be the right match.

"I’m in a complete freeze state right now and I don’t know what to do. My dogs are the only thing getting me out of bed right now because I don’t want to abandon them. But I’m also not being a good dog mom, I can’t find the will to walk them. My husband is out of town and I don’t want him to come back. I just want to crawl in a hole and never come out. I took a sick day today but I’m almost out of sick time due to always having to take sick days for my migraines triggered by ptsd. 

I have PTSD/CPTSD from DV in two relationships, emotional abuse in others, and childhood trauma. My husband is alright, he believes in therapy and is supportive but I sometimes get triggered by him and it takes me days to calm down. I’m basically stuck in a constant state of anxiety and I am having a hard time functioning. 

I really want to get physically injured or some type of severe illness so I’ll have an excuse to go to the hospital and have some hope of keeping my job. Going inpatient for mental health would mean the death of my career. I’m a lawyer and we can’t have mental health issues. And I’m the one who is the breadwinner, my husband isn’t working and if I lose our income/insurance we will become homeless or worse. 

What do I do. I have therapy later this afternoon and I’m scared of telling her how I really feel. I have an appointment with a psychiatrist later this month. Ive been in therapy for years and I still have these issues. I’m just having a hard time right now seeing a way out of this.

You are not useless. 
You are not worth less for your struggles.
You will be okay.
You are doing such a good job reaching out, and God, I hope this helps you at least a little. Makes it even slightly worth the effort spent.

Your lack of energy, lack of drive is NORMAL it is  not something you can rush away.

If you worry about your dog's health this much it at least tells me that you would contact someone if you neglected them to the point of abuse.

You mentioned your husband, and it sounds like he loves you dearly. If you can't trust yourself, then trust that the man you love is THERE. It may not always feel like it, but you are not alone.

Try to focus on external stimuli like warm water running over your skin, grass/sand under your feet when walking, fur of your dogs, sounds they make.

"Yesterday and today he has taken his anger out on me (about the case being dropped due to lack of evidence because “I didn’t do anything right and did everything wrong after the rape”. 

He’s babied me and belittled me. He has said things like I am just fucking dumb for being scared of birds (I’m just jumpy). That I’m so broken and stupid (I struggle to think clearly and use words since the trauma). That he can’t enjoy intimacy with me because of the ghosts of the men who hurt me being there when I recoil or grimace or panic. (My trauma is from multiple rapes)

I’m having numerous flashbacks today as I had to talk to the police again this morning and I later relayed the details of the conversation to my partner. 

I don’t want to tell him about the flashbacks and the constant phantom feelings because he will just complain about it later and use it against me.

The sad thing is he really is a lovely man 99% of the time. It breaks my heart when he acts like this. I know he is incredibly angry at the world and at me for good reason. I spiralled badly and broke up with him and ran away after the assault. While we were broken up I had a relationship with another man. He can’t forgive me for it and when anything reminds him of it (including my PTSD symptoms) he gets angry, first bottling it up but every now and again he goes off.

It scares me and isolates me, because I can’t tell my family as I don’t want them to dislike him and hold it against him in the future.

I’m sorry you’re going thru this. Nobody, no matter what should be speaking to you like this. Especially when you are processing a trauma.

You don’t deserve this emotional abuse. He has no reason to be angry with you- our brain is not able to think rationally or make smart decisions after a trauma. You did what you felt you had too and THATS OKAY. If you decide to stay with this man I would highly suggest trauma therapy and some education for him bc the things he’s saying and way he’s treating you is appalling.

"He as a basic, juvenile understanding of emotions.   This is getting in the way of his understanding why you behave the way you do, which frustrates him. 
 But he does not see that lack of understanding as his problem, instead he just wants the *reality of how emotions work* to be different, and becomes abusive to you when it isn't.  As if there's something *you* can do about that, but you're just too lazy or something, lol.

This is the hallmark of a narcissist, the extreme emotional breakdowns when reality conflicts with delusions of how things ""should"" be.

> I don’t know how anyone with PTSD can have a positive loving relationship.

The same way people without PTSD have loving relationships:  by prioritizing each other's emotional needs.  IMHO, someone in love would by definition *want* to do that anyway.  If one person has a few extra needs, that's just part of the package. 

Showering you with ""love"" when he's happy but taking his anger out on you when he's not (regardless if it's ""your fault"") is putting his emotional needs at the front and trampling yours.  A preview of your marriage.

I’m sorry op but this relationship is toxic and abusive. The things he says to you are terrible. He should never be throwing your ptsd in your face or belittling you. Calling you broken and stupid is extremely abusive. You need to leave him for your own sanity.

"If your partner is not your safest ally and biggest advocate at every opportunity, they have no business building a home and a life together with you. 

Your home and relationship are like a bubble in which its residents find safety and reprieve from the harsh world outside, and it’s the responsibility of all people inside it to protect its sanctity and address its vulnerabilities. If someone is repeatedly popping that bubble, you’ll never be able to rest, and thus healing from your previous traumas will be an impossible task. Everyone deserves a safe home. 

Frankly, everything I read of your fiancé in this post sounds like textbook emotional abuse. Most significantly, the way that he regularly weaponizes your profound traumas and pains against you to keep you in a vulnerable position. 

I have severe C-PTSD and I’ve been with my husband for 11 years and we just celebrated our 5th wedding anniversary. I have angry outbursts, spiral, enter depressive episodes, self-destruct and so much more all the time, and yet we’ve never exchanged words of insult or spite. Anger and frustration, sure, but it has never been the goal of either one of us to hurt the other; never ever, not once. He recognizes that my outbursts and flare-ups are a reflection of the deep pain and cognitive challenges that I have and continue to experience, applies compassion, and rightfully concludes that if it’s miserable for him in the moment, it’s likely more-so for me. Additionally, he’s my biggest champion in highlighting how far I’ve come in my healing. 

I know that life with me and my symptoms is not easy and sometimes miserable too, but life with your fiancé sounds awful and exhausting. As a human being, you deserve better. 

PS — my husband and I still sometimes joke about one of our first dates at the Science Center butterfly exhibit when I couldn’t stop ducking all over the place because of my startle reflex 😆

Schizophrenia medication saps your dopamine and makes you hate life. I've been dealing with 15 years of that due to greedy doctors. Further traumatized by inappropriate baker acts for someone with PTSD.

"Yes. My college roommates were nervous because I would be talking to someone in a dark room late at night. They didn't listen to me when I said that I was on the phone with someone and hauled me to the ER. The doctor listened to them more than she listened to me, and put me on haloperidol and a 72 hour hold. Then I was told in a house meeting that I either go to therapy or get kicked out of the shared house.

Needless to say, I took the first opportunity I found to get out of that situation. That someone I was on the phone with was a girl I had been talking to and getting along with, so I moved in with her for the rest of the year. (That turned out poorly, but not because of anything on my end.) My therapist flat-out told me that I was misdiagnosed and didn't need Haldol at all.

Then we moved on to bipolar and that didn’t fit cus I was still sleeping more often than not during night. Then when I moved therapists I was almost diagnosed with paranoid personality disorder but then I freaked out about that diagnosis and my therapist I’m with now just knocked the diagnostics manual off the table and we haven’t looked at it and labeled it ptsd.

"Yeah once first Psychosis afterwards BPD. Was a rough path till I got my diagnosis right, luckily I was critical enough, to read a lot and stopped the mesiacation experiments when my state became worse.
Mt guess is that there is  a lot of discrimination in the medical systemthere.  Pocs, Queers, Woman and klassism affected people are far more likely to become sick or expierence violence. Sooooo, first thing people of marginalised groups get more often misdiagnosed. BPD for example  is a serious but well treatable thing but, gets often misused as the new histeriakonzept. Also Poc get far more often crazy medication instead of therapy.
Reasons : experiencing discrimination,  domestic abuse, police violence and also the silent forms like trouble getting a good standing in the community finding a good flat a job arent a part of the therapeutic evaluation. By this matter a lot of stuff gets ignored.
2. Victim blaming,  marginalized groups are more likely marked as the trouble makers.  A trauma diagnosis always  questions a bit of our free and wellworking  society.  Patriachal violence, police violence,  homophic attacks etc. are a normallity which no one really wants to know about.
A diagnosis like Shizophrenia and BPD just says this person is crazy and thats the reason why they have such an instable live. Easy the problem is the person nothing needs to be questioned '
Our educational system alao has high barriers amd most therapist I met are white middle class, they are less likely to expierence violence. So they must be have lot empathy and listen well to treat and diagnose people like me well.

"So some context, I am going through therapy and emdr (haven't been able to for a bit because my mental health has declined and my therapist said we should take a break from emdr) we are starting couples therapy next week. 

So I have CPTSD it is an accumulation of childhood trauma and sexual abuse later in life over a very long period of time. One of my biggest triggers is a dark room with only the light of like a TV (phone, computer etc) the reason for this is I had a friend that offered his couch to me to escape an abusive relationship. Well he traumatized me as well. He would watch pirn on his computer in the dark and if I saw that I new I was going to be raped that night if I fell asleep. So I ended up with insomnia and it was just added to my ptsd list of bullsh*t. So my partner now is a really great guy, he has messed up before and had no boundaries with anyone else so he was overly ""friendly"" with others. He stepped up cut out the toxic ppl and made changes. The one he keeps fighting me on is having a light on if he is going to game or watch TV at night. Like last night I asked if he could turn the light on, he did. But then I walk past the bedroom to go to the bathroom (I have been sleeping on the couch, since things have been stressful between us) and the light is off and the TV is still on. He's asleep. So I turn it off and go back out to the couch and I can't sleep. I took my sleeping meds and everything. Nothing until like 6am I pass out but wake up 3 hours later because of a nightmare. I tried to fall back asleep but even my cat trying to cuddle with me jolted me awake. I try to talk with him that this is too hard on me and all I want is a little compassion. He says that it is hard to be compassionate when he feels like a trapped bird. I know I have many triggers and honestly there are only 3 that I have asked for compromises for. The light is the first one. The second is any show that might be triggering to be watched with headphones. And if it's going to be in the bedroom that he forwarns me. And last is music is headphones. (He doesn't listen to lyrics so he has played some very graphic ones) I still will try new songs with him. And have tried some shows with potential triggers with him. But I really don't think I am asking for alot? He does them for a bit but then pushes the boundary then gets upset that I am upset. I am physically and mentally drained. Idk what to do anymore."

I said shit needed to change he agreed and whenever I brought shit up it took so many times of me bringing it up for it to finally click in his brain. Then it is great. But it's exhausting having to keep saying the same shit over and over. He doesn't mind me bringing things up but he doesn't like the frequency. I get that but it's like I am talking to a brick wall. He rarely understands and says this is a little thing, does this have to be an issue. Ie me asking for a lamp to be on. Honestly I will see where couples therapy goes.

Does anyone else feel trapped in their own mind and body? I feel like the trauma has literally changed my brain and every place I’m in, I want to escape. Finding places with a lot of space around me help but still feel like my brain is trapped. Wondered if anyone else experienced this and what helps you to create space to feel more open and have some sense of freedom?

I'm so very sorry you're going through that.  What you're describing is the fight/flight/freeze response.  It's when your brain and body basically shut non-essential functions down and go into survival mode - usually some degree of hypervigilance (constantly scanning your surroundings for danger) and some numbing out or dissociation that removes you from the worst of the painful experience.  In a way your brain is trying to protect you from further harm, but it still feels awful.  Psychology Today and The Mighty have good articles on how to cope with dissociation using grounding techniques and mindfulness.  Spend as much time as you can in the places and with the people that make you feel safest.  Know that you're not alone and that with time, support and some good self care it will get better.

Definitely see if you can find a therapist who is empathetic - and like I say don't be surprised if you have to go through a few.  You could also look at EMDR and believe it or not playing Tetris when you feel triggered.  There's some good research on how it can help the brain tone down the emotion surrounding the memory.  There's something about the combination of color, movement and spatial cognition of that particular game that seems to help some people.

"I am the person who gets their temper lost on.  Every few days by my wife for 5 years now and it’s just brutal,  don’t want to downplay that, but it really is ok. I promise.
You sound aware that this will happen again. So you can’t make sure it won’t, but you can make others prepared and tell them what helps you (don’t argue with me, give me space, don’t wake me, etc.) and you won’t feel this way after. The only thing that helps (or has helped those my wife has hurt) is to be direct, honest and acknowledge that you know what you did and that it hurt them. and don’t make any promises that you can’t keep.. Tell them you have a condition and give them instructions on how to deal with it because we need guidelines. They’ll feel closer to you and empowered next time and know it’s not them, just something you’re dealing with that they should have empathy for because it could be any one of us easily.
I know it hurts you really bad afterwards. It isolates you I’m sure. I’m sorry about that. You get triggered, though. That’s kinda the whole thing. You’re all good.

I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating it can be when you experience conflicting emotions. It's not odd that you're feeling resentment and grief. The process is different for everyone. Keep in mind that your feelings are valid and you aren't odd. Trauma is very depressing and difficult to overcome, but you can do it.

My partner is incredibly angry at what we lost, he blames me and it is my fault as I fell apart terribly and ruined a lot more myself.

I find myself grieving a lot too. I find it hard to reconcile how the trauma stole so much time before and it feels like it continues to steal time. But, I remind myself that my body is adaptive, and as I keep myself safe, as I practice being embodied in safety, (of course with therapy and needed medical assistance at times) I am able to  stay embodied more often. Or even if I do get triggered, I at least know what’s happening that that it will pass. Tending to the grief by tending to my younger self with lots of encouragement and nurturing strategies has helped me take back more of my life.

"I’ve been diagnosed with GAD, MDD, and PTSD. I’m 17, in my senior year, on two medications for anxiety, and I had my first day of senior year.

A boy in my class raped me. Plain and simple. I never filed a police report because it would be my word against his, I had no proof. It’s turned my life upside down and although it was over a year ago, my symptoms are getting worse.

My school had an abrogation to keep me and this man out of the same room. My parents told them to do it, they told me we’d be on separate floors, and my psychiatrist sent them a letter detailing how he was not to be anywhere near me.

First day of school, I have to walk past him in the hallway several times, I have lunch with him, and I had a class with him. The only thing they were ok with changing was my class with him, despite the numerous other complaints I had about my schedule. They basically said,”Find a way to avoid him.”

Their negligence has caused me so much pain, and all I can do right now is cry because my sleep meds aren’t working. I have to go through another year of even worse fear because of everyone’s failure.

This is so painful. Literally nobody gives half a shit about the 4 anxiety attacks I had during the school day because of seeing him.

"I had a look at your profile to write something more personal.

I know dealing with anxiety can be tough, but I want you to know that you are not alone in this journey. Your cat is more than just a pet; they are a source of unconditional love and support. Whenever you feel overwhelmed, take a moment to cuddle up with your furry friend, as their presence can bring a sense of calm and reassurance.

Moreover, drawing can be a powerful outlet for expressing your emotions and channeling your thoughts. Let yourself be immersed in the world of art, where you can create something beautiful, meaningful, and entirely your own. Don't worry about the outcome; it's the process of drawing that matters most.

Remember, anxiety doesn't define you, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Be gentle with yourself, and give yourself credit for every small victory, no matter how insignificant it may seem. Focus on the present moment, take deep breaths, and practice mindfulness whenever you can.

Reach out to your support network, whether it's friends, family, or online communities, and share your feelings with them. Sometimes, talking about our fears and anxieties can make them feel less overwhelming.

You are strong, resilient, and capable of navigating through this challenging time. Embrace the things that bring you joy, like your cat's playful antics or the satisfaction of completing a beautiful drawing. Keep nurturing those passions, and know that brighter days lie ahead.

"In full honesty, I’ve been experiencing multiple symptoms and I’m like 90% sure that I have PTSD but I can get treat for it without a diagnosis, and my parents are one of those people who don’t think I have it because whenever they ask me what trauma I’ve experienced, I get an immediate brain fog and can’t tell them for some reason. I know I have trauma, but this just has been very difficult for me, and they refuse to get me treated or even diagnosed. 

As for the for the symptoms I mentioned earlier, here are the following: Tiredness, emotional numbness, brain fog when I’m confronted about my trauma or subjects related to ptsd, constantly feeling the need to check over my shoulder, lack if motivation, I’ll experience random wave if depression even though I’m not depressed, and hearing yelling even when not directed at me puts me on edge even if there is no malice behind it. I’ve also noticed that I feel like I need to be on high alert. The only reason my thoughts are clear right now is because I don’t have to verbalize them.

My question for anyone in the community who is either a licensed therapist or someone currently dealing with PTSD, is do I have it?

"a lot of psyciatric diagnoses has similiar symptons, hence why you need a education to prober diagnose people. but as a healthworker i can't see PTSD directly, i can see similarities sure, most important is you, not some diagnose you have or not, but how are you doing?   
Can be a lot of different symptons to diffrient diagnoses.  
skizotapi   
depression with trauma  
trauma  
base skizofrenia (this one has no psykoses, only negative symptons, numb feeling, brain fog, lack of motivation, lazyness, depressive thoughts)  
if you really want to explore what kind of diagnoses i'm talking about, and why there is so many similarities look up ICD-10 and his psyciatric diagnoses - US has a different name it tho, icd-10 is rest of the world.  


and even if it is PTSD, would you be happy ? and if it's not PTSD, would you be sad ?  
no treatment for it, no pills, only support groups/doctor appointments.   
i would trade PTSD anyday for anything else. not a wishfull diagnose.  
i'm not telling you NO, and i'm not telling you YES. i'm mearly telling you, that dont diagnose your self, be hornest and tell how you fell, and call a doctor, explain how you feel and that's it.let the proffesionals handle diagnoses.

There are many conditions which could cause those symptoms. For your symptoms to be caused by PTSD, you would have to have been traumatized.

You must have some idea what the trauma could have been, because although it is possible, it's exceedingly rare to have no memory whatsoever of a traumatic experience. We often forget the details or lose the ability to directly recall the memory, but if asked we know what happened to us, generally speaking.

Instead of telling your parents you have PTSD, focus on the symptoms you're experiencing in general. It sounds more like depression and anxiety that could be due to trauma. Maybe you can show them the symptoms of anxiety on the DSM-5? That's what professionals use.

I'm not a therapist, and only someone licensed can diagnose, but it sounds like you're suffering with some significant symptoms. All I know about PTSD is it's mainly about flashbacks/nightmares (re-experiencing the event), hypervigilance (eg looking over your shoulder, jumping at noises) and avoidance (avoiding memories, feelings of the traumatic event, or people, places, situations, etc that remind us)	TheGamingNerd80085	reply	na	na	na	0.9917511343955994	no	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"I’m sorry your parents are being dismissive.  You can’t get diagnosed in this group it’s against the rules. You need a doctor. How about tell your parents you are really struggling with your mental health and tell them that you need to go to a doctor. You certainly may have ptsd but you may not, a lot of conditions have symptom overlap. 

Have you asked what kind of coverage is available for mental health under your parents insurance? 

If they get dismissive maybe consider it this way—  if you had a physical health issue if they would prevent you from going to the doctor about it? Mental health is just as important as physical health.

"This isn’t a judgement about how hard your life is, it’s more about the type of experience. PTSD is typically caused by an experience where your life was threatened, or you experienced a major injury, or had an otherwise overwhelmingly physically painful experience. It’s a disorder caused by your nervous system getting overwhelmed by the experience such that it becomes damaged.

For example, a bully insulting you constantly is horrible but that’s not something that would give you PTSD.

Yes, however I did learn from a cousin of mine who is getting a psych degree that ptsd is often times shrugged off due to the way the current system works and in many cases, people are not diagnosed because the therapist or psychologist deems them not in need of treatment, so they will avoid diagnosing them with anything and normally chalk it up to minor depression or something along the lines of attention seeking.

"I can very much relate to these feelings, I also feel like I've lost a lot of my sharpness, and my memory is now terrible when I don't think it used to be, but I can't remember! I have watched every idiot around me succeed more than I have due to my issues holding me back and it's demoralizing. I am quite a smart person despite my issues, but I can't hold focus on anything for long, have trouble functioning in certain environments and in social situations and struggle with emotional regulation, and this is enough to derail me in succeeding at anything major. 

The issue is that after trauma we're constantly wired for survival and once the original survival situation is over, the decisions that were made to survive that were good at the time, now become bad choices based on fear and negativity, which breed more of the same.  I believe the previous state of operating can return, maybe not to normal, but to some approximation of normal compared to PTSD mode.

The problem you and I share is that we focus on what isn't right and how it's wrong and how we fail. Because of that we literally hand rail ourselves into the negative outcomes. We add additional stress to ourselves which then impacts our brain and triggers OCD. The trick is to stop caring. Not as in give up but to accept. It is what it is and this too shall pass. The relief from the stress means that our brains train to have positive thinking and the alleviation of stress starts to heal the hypocampus.

"I completely relate to how you are feeling. But it can get better. 

I experienced intense brain fog and a decline in cognitive ability following some extremely traumatic experiences as a teen, and it got bad enough that I dropped out of school because I couldn’t perform well enough to meet even the bare minimum of expectations. After lots of therapy, support, self-reflection, and working on motivation and discipline, I’ve found my functionality gradually returning over the years. I have since returned to school and work, and even made the dean’s list taking all STEM courses despite having failed every single math class from the beginning of my education through high school.

But we can’t change the past, and we will get where we need to be. Even if you feel that you are several steps behind, you are still walking the same path. 

I know it doesn’t magically fix the difficulties that you’re facing, but I think it’s important to remember that you aren’t “dumb”. You are dealing with a very difficult condition.

Hi OP. I have you tried EMDR? When I was diagnosed, I described my life as “unmanageable” in a quite chaotic and frazzled call to a local therapist. 4 months of EMDR turned my life around (and I would say saved it TBH).

"I think it's multifaceted, there's being stuck in survival mode which is all about surviving the current moment rather than learning new things and I think storing long term memories is less likely to happen in this mode. 

There's also the constant repression and dissociation that goes on in traumatised people, we're always pushing down and locking away any overwhelming experiences just so we can get through the day and those memories quickly become difficult to access once they're buried in there. I have probably a decade of my life that I have no memory of, and even in more recent years the recall is patchy at best. 

You can get creative however, aside from doing therapy and all the things everyone always talks about, you can write a regular journal, take lots of photos and make a record of your life and revisit it from time to time so that you don't forget as easily."

"I really felt the same way as you did for a long time. I found it really helped making small adjustments to my life, that helped work WITH my symptoms. For example I have bad insomnia. I used to try to force myself into doing morning classes and work shifts. Now I have accepted that, due to my symptoms, I am not going to bed before 3am and it’s best if I just work around my messed up sleep cycle by doing night classes and midnights. Now, I am actually performing well AND I am not just sitting awake ruminating about my trauma, because I have tasks to distract me. 

I still struggle, but there’s definitely been improvements, and I’m still learning what works everyday. And we are all different, there’s no one size fits all. We cannot change what’s happened to us, but I think we can almost always adjust ourselves. It’s all about finding what works best for you. 

I wish you luck and have faith that you too can find ways to get back to your best. It is really trial and error it seems like. Don’t lose hope, one day you will thank yourself!!! Trauma takes a long time to heal from but the brain fogginess can be lifted! And you can go on to achieve and do great things still.

I'm not really sure if what I'm describing is a succession of errors. I was traumatized and it isn't my fault. It's not your fault either. I just never took the time to deal with it, so my body and my mind slowly forced me into a point where I have no choice but to deal with it.

"The only thing I know for sure is that it's not your fault and you're not alone.  

The research seems to show that there are changes in the way that the brain functions after a traumatic event (or a series of traumatic events).  Our brains are so busy trying to look out for possible threats that we don't have the bandwidth for anything else. We are literally in survival mode, which doesn't leave much room for concentration or creativity.

Hang in there and know that with time and support it can get better.  I know it's easier said than done and it's not a magic bullet, but everything you can do to support your brain matters: eating well, getting consistent quality sleep, breathing exercises, concentrating for short chunks of time, etc."	Fresh_Economics4765	reply	na	na	na	0.9952605366706848	weak	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"So ironically it was a friend who had read the secret that started me down the path. I'm a medic by trade so there's a certain element of disdain when looking at that from myself but actually it gave me the nudge to start approaching life differently.

I'm still building my new understanding so bare with me.

My current thought process is as follows:

I'll start with the religious part of the movement because this is the bit I find most bothersome.

God is not an entity like organised religion believes or touts. It's a collection of all things as we come from energy and energy cannot be destroyed or created. We simply merge in and out of it as we die and live. Therefore god is the universe and all entities. I can be comfortable here knowing that what people call god is actually just universe -dontnknow if this helps you.

A result of this means that the universe is connected to me in an innate way as we are all of the same. It makes no sense to me that the universe wants to conduct self harm by ruining my life and in that sense, wants a healthy ecosystem and equilibrium and balance.

It is that observation that allowed me to move past the obvious issues with the manifest your dreams element of the movement and try and read between the lines.

I'm also aware of win and loss spirals. The idea that if an event occurs that you lose against your much more likely not to have the resources to win the next event and so end up in a loss spiral. This then causes you to expect the loss and your approach to the situation likely provokes the loss.

By changing your thought process to believe the universe/god wants you to succeed, I believe it does, then it Leeds you to believe that the universe will provide an event for you to climb up. This means that you are approaching the situations and events with less fear and as a result start to win. These concurrent wins lift you up and teach you not to approach everything with fear which is counterproductive.

In this way you manifest your new elevation by provoking a new mindset that isn't fight or flight.

This is my current understanding and helps me greatly working as a medic in understanding that when my patients die they simply return to the universes energy and we will all be one and the same again at some point. We are here to learn and experience and the universe wants that for us. It's not hell. How we thinkfrom learned experienced causes us to isolate and displace is. This causes us to learn to fear and causes us to miss out on the opportunities the universe puts before us.

I hope this helps you. I have had to put so much thought into coming to terms with this to lift me out of my situation and it has healed me. There are alot of people out there who don't want to find themselves responsible for their situation and will attempt to attack you as you rise so they aren't alone in their torment but you can let them stay there whilst you rise and learn to approach with positive mindset and may even pull them with you.

I've found as Ive improved I've attracted more positive people and amazing things have happened I would have lost before. I've also lifted those around me. It was really really uncomfortable to begin with though.

Anyway I hope this doesn't get me sectioned haha!"	Fresh_Economics4765	reply	na	na	na	0.9952605366706848	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"Im sorry- im new here so i am sorry if my post is wrong. trigger warning:

Monday something happened to me. I dont even know how to say it, Happened around me? Involving me? Because what happened was to someone else. I was thrown into a life or death situation in which I had to jump in and try to save a life while on the way home from a hospital crisis call. I witnessed someone in critical condition on the edge of death. He was young. He was out living his life and in an instant because of someone else, it was abruptly changed forever. I found him on IG because I wanted to let him and his family know that he wasnt alone and that we had his glasses.  (his outlook wasnt good but we were hoping the response was fast enough). He has a family. Thinking of the family not even knowing what had just occurred, I cant handle it.  Im an HSP (as told by my therapist) so the emotions I was feeling surrounding this has been overwhelming to put it lightly. I have been spending so much time researching him, checking the news, calling hospitals, morgues, because I just want him to be okay. I want to make sure his family knows. I cant stop seeing the things i saw. Hearing a specific noise I cant get out of my head. That feeling of panic.

&#x200B;

I feel like a phoney for struggling with this, and like I cant possibly have PTSD. Even though my therapist diagnosed me with it and ive had flashbacks, panic attacks, crying spells, disassociation, etc. I saw and heard things that still make me shake and cry if I begin to think about them, and I was panicking the entire time. I feel like the trauma didn't even happen to me! how can i actually be traumatized and struggling when someone may have literally lost their life?? 

Im a nurse but ive been out of practice for three years. I was the only one on scene for the first few minutes and it felt like hours. Then i tell myself that people in an ER see things like i did every day and I feel like an absolute wimp and hate myself and feel like I am making it up.

I also feel guilty. So guilty any time I feel a glimmer of joy. Like  I shouldn't be, because how can someone smile after what I went through? Its just SO many thoughts, so many emotions, im a depressed and anxious and OCD mess as it is so this is just so much to handle. I have a good support system, its just alot of new emotions I cannot begin to understand how to process"	tinypawprints	post	18.20094077192398	female	White	0.9831415414810181	na	na	na	3	ptsd	no prediction.
I’ve felt this way my whole life about stuff. As I get older, I’ve learned that it doesn’t matter so much what happened but how you feel. If you feel trauma, it’s as real as anything else. Focus on how you’re feeling, and work from there. The cause of the trauma and feelings is less important.	tinypawprints	reply	na	na	na	0.9831415414810181	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"It must have been hard for you dear. First of all, I wanna tell you that you are not exaggerating. I know right now you feel like getting all the answers. Why it happened?  How it happened? All the what's and who's? 

But a thing is right now you don't need that. Your brain gets stuck in that flight fight freeze mode. And you also don't need to worry about it. 

You are an HSP. As you say. We all have different nervous systems and our body responds differently acc to our nervous system. Being an HSP, I already know you are a great person. You ask why ? Because you are kind, compassionate and empathetic. All the qualities to understand someone. (I know right now you may feel like it's a curse due to all the triggers and overwhelming emotions but when your system gonna calm and you have understood the situation for yourself It's gonna put a smile on your face) .

Sometimes we as hsps absorb alot of emotions, even those which aren't ours. And this can overwhelm our system easily. Being an hsp It can be really helpful if we learn how to recognize with our emotions and others. But forget about it. 

You say you are experiencing trauma of something that didn't happen to you it happened to someone else. So why are you feeling ? It's normal my fellow human. It's called vicarious trauma. But don't go on labels so much.   


What you need to remember :--- 
Because right now, remember when I told you you'll get into what's and why's. Right now your body doesn't need that. Your body your nervous system needs relaxation to get rid of the overwhelm. Once you relax your nervous system you yourself will get answers and understand in a better way. Just soothen and relax. 
Now relaxation :- meditate 
                               Spending time in nature
If you feel like your system too overwhelmed, I can suggest you Brahmi supplements from amway, they are organic supplements. And will calm you. Take one everyday. They have no side effects.  These aren't medicines. Medicines are degrading to health. Mostly avoid them. 

Pray to Divine to guide you. As IT will handle everything. 

Once your systems calm you will understand the situation for yourself. You are gonna do well. 🌻 wish you well kind soul."	tinypawprints	reply	na	na	na	0.9831415414810181	weak	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
I get you. Just remember not to overwhelm yourself. As Hsps we are susceptible to. It's okay to take break for yourself and take care of your body. Untangle your emotions from others connecting to your authenticity. Self love is the most important thing in the universe.

 There's an age range that I've always said things happened at but I never understood why. I've had a lot of trauma before and after that I kind of am aware of, but I never knew this one until recently. Idk why but a fragment of this memory came back, I don't even have all of it, but what I do have tells me I was raped. I assume at that age point, but I have no meaningful details, just a flashback that keeps replaying. I know nothing; no details. This isn't new, but it's new to me, but it feels strange looking for support for something I'm not even 100% sure of, for something that idk when it happened.

"Very recently, I’ve been noticing that when I go to bed and begin to fall asleep, if someone makes a loud noise,  I wake startled, with my adrenaline running like crazy, nauseous and terrified. I quickly understand that I am not in danger but it still takes me a few mts to bring my system back down. During the summer, my younger children have been playing around in bed before falling asleep, completely normal behavior. Occasionally I’ll be slightly loud and tell them to go to sleep. This time, I was falling asleep and my husband loudly told them to go to sleep. I woke up startled,looking everywhere, my heart thumping so loud, I was shaking and nauseous and I began sobbing. My husband apologized and held me till I calmed down and fell asleep. I understand that there’s nothing happening half a second after I wake up, it’s just an innate response. This hasn’t happened before. There’s no violence at home, there’s no screaming other than the kids playing or the occasionally “hey boys, go to sleep!”. I’m in the safest place in the world that I could be. I’m not stressed, I’m not going through any type of hardship, I’m ok. Coming from a DV and CSA home , I’ve been out of that world for over 20 yrs.  Im wondering why I’m going into full fight or flight from a loud noise or slight yell, after so many yrs.

"First of all, she will never ""get normal"" like she was 4 years ago. Second, help her seek some therapy, and give her space and time. Pressuring her (I am not saying you are) will only make things worse. It will not resolve itself, she needs therapy. 

If you're losing your confidence over her, then you may need to walk away if you're standing around waiting for her to go back to the way she was. To me, and I could be very wrong, you seem like you're putting a time limit on her getting better. Which depending on the trauma, she may never fully ""get better."" As there is no ""cure"" for PTSD. You can manage it with treatment and possibly medications, but it is and always will be there in some sort of fashion. 

What you really need to do is step back, give her space and let her know that no matter what, you'll be there for her, if that's what you're going to do. Be her safe space, not a space she has to worry about. Please don't ask about it, let her come to you. Also, don't use words like talking bullshit. That wont help anything."

"ptsd is a complicated condition. if you're waiting on her to just magically ""get better"" you're waiting on nothing. because that isn't how it works.

she is likely saying these things because she's scared of the people around her. your mind can be your worse enemy sometimes, and it seems though in this case.

it will be a long healing process and she likely will never be the same she was 4 years ago, but she can improve from her current state with the proper support, and you're a part of that. listen to her and help her in the way she feels is right for her. don't force what you believe is right for her onto her."

"Trauma isn't consistent and it doesn't make sense.

The brain chemistry of a trauma victim undergoes massive changes. The cause, be it physical, mental, sexual, or all three combined, has next to no predictable outcome in terms of severity or which symptoms an individual may present.


A person with trauma is living their life trapped in the midst of a stormy ocean that at times seems calm.

But under the surface... currents churn with chaotic abandon leading to unpredictable upheavals imbued with pure primal terror and rage so entwined with doubt, fear, shame, and regret that there is no making sense of it in the moment that calm and clear sky's become a dark and hellish parody of reality that cannot be ignored, only endured. 

It is something that cannot be understood from a rational perspective. 

Logic and reason hold no sway when the trauma breaks free. It overrules all else but survival..

Trauma victims, are in part stuck in a time and place they cannot escape. 

Trapped with the worst side of humanity that exists, their heart seared the undeniable truth that at any moment, a person could turn into a monster and what they went through could be happening again. 

Fear and terror of a sufficient degree bypasses higher reasoning and wounds a person's sense of self, sense of reality.. worst of all, wounds their ability to trust themselves. 

The best way to support anyone with trauma, is to not judge, give them space/time to process when they become overwhelmed, support them in the ways they need, and most vitaly, to not react with negativity or panic.

You must be the calm center of the storm and be able to look into the hell playing out on their face and not. Fucking. Flinch. Ever. 

If you cannot do that, then you need to learn to. If you cannot learn to, then you need to accept that when they are hurting and lost, that they will find the strength to come back after the storm has passed.

Your job is to have faith enough to hold the darkness back, even when they hate themselves, and see the person trapped the storm trying desperately to survive a world that betrayed and finally broke them.

Be a light in the darkness, and help them find the strength to keep moving forward even when all hope seems lost."	SwimmingSensitive125	reply	na	na	na	0.009805066511034966	no	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"She isn’t “talking bullshit”, she’s struggling. She is showing symptoms of PTSD. My recommendation is she get some trauma related therapy to help her. As far as you wanting her “back to normal”, there’s no such thing. She is still the same person as before, but she’s struggling with demons of her own. From the outside to someone who has no idea what PTSD personally feels like, it may look strange or random. In reality it’s not black or white at all. PTSD isn’t like sadness or anxiety, a specific emotion. It’s tons of emotions and scary thoughts hitting you like a freight train. It’s overwhelming. 

As much as people in the comments say ur being an ass, which from this side kind of makes sense, it seems to me like you do care. You were willing to ask for advice on here, and it shows u do care. The way you say certain things like “talking bullshit” is invalidating to her, but it’s a learning curve. Learning about this, even for people like you who are watching someone with trauma, is difficult to navigate. That being said, I think it’s important that not only she gets help, but you learn how to help her if she needs it. Her journey is not a straightforward road, and progress isn’t linear, so if you don’t feel you can be patient and learn, maybe it’s best to step away. If you choose to stay with her, be patient and be there for her. Sometimes she’ll have moments where she’s really upset and there’s nothing u can do to fix it. The best thing is to be there for her, especially while she’s figuring out how to help herself. Best of luck!"

Unfortunately she'll never be like she was before the trauma but she will eventually be able to heal from the trauma and it won't be as hard for her. She has to do trauma therapy to help her. And if meds are needed 1-2 months isn't enough typically. I know you're not a native English speaker but it definitely sounds like you're having a hard time being supportive.

"You and her should sit down, figure out what exact triggers she can identify and come up with a plan together to avoid those triggers. Also, do some research on ""ART"" for PTSD. It has helped a lot of people, I'm waiting on my appointment to start it myself. It has a good success rate with eliminating those triggers. I've had PTSD for decades and it often doesn't have a rhyme or reason for how the person behaves. I can go from crying and panicking, to wanting to fight or worrying about anything and everything. Flashbacks give me a lot of trouble as well. My fiance is really good about seeing it start up, and calming me down by getting my mind off it, snuggling with me, or limiting the stimulation around me. For example turn off the TV, music, etc, and tell me to focus on my breathing and relax while she holds me.

Treatment options are available for her to work towards getting past PTSD, ART included. Exposure therapy, medications, meditation, therapy, etc. I found most of what has helped me on my own through research on the internet. Hopefully she can do the same with your help of course, and find a solution that works best for you and her. I wish nothing but the best for both of you.

"Love this response.

I needed to hear this for my own PTSD ... 
I didn't fully realise this but I've measured my recovery by comparing myself to my pre-traumatised self. To be fair, it's in part due to ex-'friends' saying they preferred the 'old me.' Ultimately, they were not solid or healthy friendships – which I'm slowly coming to terms with... 

But this old standard of myself remains...a 'bad' day is defined by my deviation from my old 'norm.'

"This is for both, you and her. Her problem will not be resolved fast. What is resolved is the trauma response. My husband is my safe space when I have a physical trauma response. Yes, the physical response diminishes after a few minutes, but the reason that I had the response is still there, and my husband cannot fix that. It's something I am working through in therapy along with medications. 

She NEEDS therapy. None of this will be fixed without it. I get run away thoughts a lot. I have a husband and kids. I cannot control this instantly; it takes time for me to settle those thoughts down and bring the logic back to the forefront. I've had to reach out to my therapist and doctor when those thoughts of running away arise. 

I appreciate the explanation of the ""bullshit"" term. Wipe that out of your vocab completely with this situation. Those are her intrusive thoughts. They can be scary for her because she can't control them. Also, from my therapist, intrusive thoughts can actually end up being impulsive (acted upon) if they're not recognized and treated."

If she has mentioned suicide, you should seek a therapist ASAP for her. Also, you may want to try and talk about getting her help NOW, if she is suicidal. That is a strong sign that she has or is at least considering suicide when she goes through a trigger. Like Famous\_fee said, this isn't going to be a fast paced process. I've been dealing with PTSD for decades, and even today, doctors aren't sure exactly what works to help with it and what doesn't, because everyone is different and everyone handles their trauma differently, along with there being TONS of different traumas one can go through. It's a very long journey for most, to see any results at all. However there are things you can do to make her feel safer until a solution can be found. She may not feel like reaching out for help, but that's where you come in and try and get her the help she needs. Maybe talk to others that are close to her and that she trusts about helping find her mental health help.	SwimmingSensitive125	reply	na	na	na	0.009805066511034966	no	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

Both. You aren't a doctor with all due respect and she isn't either (I'm assuming). Even if you or her were, get her in to see a psychologist and they'll decide whether or not she needs to see a psychiatrist or not. Chances are, if it's that bad, she will probably need medication and weekly-biweekly therapy sessions. It seems like it's a wrench in your plans and routine for your life. However, you could actually save her life. Or at the very least make her quality of life better, if you find a good psychologist and psychiatrist to visit. They are like any other profession...some are shit and don't listen or try....some try their heart out to try and make you feel better.

For a long time I wished I could just go back and make choices with the wisdom and knowledge I have now, make choices with my mental health in a somewhat better place than it is now. Evenually I've kinda realized that you can't keep living in the past, and although there isn't always justice for those that have torn your life apart, you can come out on top by just living life the way you want to live it, and not letting someone else's poor choices keep you from living.

Hello 👋🏻 My trauma is hospital related, but really anything medical is a trigger for me. It’s only been 6 months, but I had an eye dr appt and ended up completely melting down and blacking out (side note: apparently significant trauma can cause blood vessels in your eyes to hemorrhage so make sure y’all are getting your eyes checked). I probably shouldn’t have gone alone, but my whole family lives on the other side of the country. I considered getting a service dog, but I would mainly just need it for Dr appts. What do y’all think? If you have a service dog, what made you decide to get one? If not, what should I do?

"For me the dog was a last resort. Nothing else was working, at least not well enough. Even with all the therapy and meds I could get, I was still getting worse and needed more help.

I'm not saying it has to be like that for everyone! But it's what it was like for me.

Having a service dog kind of blows, not going to lie. So I'd recommend thinking very carefully about it to decide whether it's worth the trade off. I think only needing it for doctor's appointments could actually improve that, though, since the main reason it sucks is taking them everywhere (and the way people treat you when you do). But nevertheless, you'll definitely need to think about it. 

How would the dog help you with doctor's appointments, for example? Like for me, one of my most important tasks, especially at the beginning, was teaching the dog to recognize panic/flashbacks and do something to help de-escalate. I was very bad at doing that unassisted, especially back then. You didn't say where you're from, and the legal requirements depend on that. But if you're from the US, the dog needs at least one specific, trained task that mitigates a disability in order to be recognized as a service dog. (in other words, keeping you company/general comfort from the dog's presence doesn't make them a service dog and you wouldn't be able to take them to the doctor if that's all they do). When you're deciding on what tasks you need, think first about what it is you struggle with doing on your own, very specifically. Make a list of stuff you want help with. After you have that, start brainstorming about a specific action a dog could take to help with it. For example, if you have panic attacks and need help de-escalating, put that on your list. Then think how a dog could assist. Would you like them to nudge you and get/hold your attention? Lead you out of the triggering environment? What is actually going to mitigate your panic? 

Once you have a task list together of the things you want the dog trained to do, you'll want to start looking into getting an actual dog and a trainer. I don't recommend getting the dog without at least having them assessed by the trainer first. The dog will need both task training and public access training (at least sufficient for a doctor's office). The public access part is kind of a bitch. It requires a dog with the right temperament or it has a very high chance of failing training. It's also pretty extensive training that requires a lot of obedience and socialization. So it can get very expensive. And time consuming. Expect to spend a few thousand dollars and probably about 2 years to get the dog fully trained. Maybe less time than that if you're really not going to take them *anywhere* but the doctor's, but...It still requires a lot of background to be ready for an environment like that, and you'd want to start when they're a puppy anyway."	misslouhou	reply	na	na	na	0.9961137771606445	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
Thank you so much, this is very helpful! I’m in Florida. I definitely would need de-escalation, but it’s hard to know what would help that. DPT is the only one I had heard of, so that’s kind of what I was thinking, but I guess I’m not really sure if that would actually de-escalate my panic attacks. I haven’t been able to stop them from coming before, I usually just ride it out until I come down and end up exhausted for the next 48hrs or so	misslouhou	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9961137771606445	strong	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"Have you tried a weighted blanket?

I'm asking because DPT from a dog is similar in some ways. Different in others. But if the weight of a blanket helps you, there's a decent chance DPT would too (and it's more portable). So I'd recommend experimenting with weighted blankets and see how you feel about it.

Bonus, you can use the blanket to figure out how practical it would be coming from a dog. Like, if it only makes you feel better when you're lying flat on your back and the blanket is evenly distributed across your whole body, the dog likely wouldn't work. But having it wadded up a bit in your lap or on your chest? If that's helpful, you can train a dog to lay in specific positions for it.

Also as a side note, if you plan to train DPT as a task, the size of the dog is a high priority in choosing a breed. You want at least a ballpark idea of what size dog is actually going to be beneficial. Heavy enough but not too heavy. Get yourself an idea of the weight you're looking for--the blanket can help you figure that out too."	misslouhou	reply	na	na	na	0.9961137771606445	no	no	strong	na	ptsd	no prediction.

Then they said that wasnt possible to do that and maybe it was even good,because this way i can confront my Trauma (doctors talking) and offered me strong medicine to cope, which i refused.

I'm not sure if they're trying to do some version of exposure therapy here, but I have my doubts that it works for PTSD triggers, I think it's more effective as an anxiety treatment. If you don't sleep, your mental health degrades very quickly, and I suspect that will be faster than how long it'd take for exposure therapy to take effect, so it's counterproductive in my opinion. If they won't remove them, could you cover them somehow with some cardboard or something so the pictures aren't visible? I think it's unreasonable to refuse your request, you have a good reason and I presume the clinic is for healing and this is counterproductive to that goal. Maybe try talking to a superior if you can and see if they're more receptive to it.	throwawayszwsx	reply	na	na	na	0.9994822144508362	no	no	no	na	ptsd	failed
"What kind of pictures are they?

I guess it depends on where you are in your healing journey and age.

The reality is that our triggers will always be there. The world doesn't suddenly stop being triggering. We, however, learn to cope with the triggers, and as a result, they become less triggering over time or the impact time they have is significantly less. 

If they won't remove it and there's nothing that can be done, it's out of your control. The only thing in your control is your response. Instead of looking at the pictures as a huge hindrance, I encourage you to view them as an opportunity to practice coping with a trigger."	throwawayszwsx	reply	na	na	na	0.9994822144508362	no	no	strong	na	ptsd	failed
"I have OCD and PTSD too. I feel that they are trying to slowly desensitize your brain to the images through constant exposure therapy (you having to physically view these images all of the time). I have been through something similar. It's a form of ERP (exposure response prevention) typically used to desensitize and ""teach"" your brain into thinking/perceiving/acting differently in response to a trigger or trauma.

"so the title sums it up lol

but for so more context never really cared ab sex or relationships growing up. but when i did find out ab porn it became a nightly ritual. then two years ago i came out as trans (FTM) and started testosterone. much more confident now and me now compared to 2021 me is much healthier with processing and understanding my trauma (CSA). and the only times ive ever had sex with someone else i was baked(lol). and thinking ab sex isnt the most pleasant for me even if i really like the person. but like ever since taking T my libido has gone up. i guess its not the end of the world i dont mind i just find it awkward when i wanna sleep over with my friends or not think about that each night but its almost a ritual at this point. any one experience the same thing trans or not?"	pineapple_drink_milk	post	21.120495082310644	male	White	0.0018534987466409802	na	na	na	10	ptsd	failed

i was the same way for majority of my life, up until my most recent partner. i enjoyed jerking off and did it very regularly and would finish but as soon as i’d start actually having sex with someone i’d become too dissociated to be inside of my body to feel anything. even when i started dating my most recent partner, i was uncontrollably disconnected from my body during sex and would just wait for it to be over. i thought i’d always be this way and was pretty bummed about it but one day it finally happened. i thought it was just a lucky day and it wouldn’t happen again but with enough time and with me feeling more and more safe with my partner it became an every day thing!! idk what the special sauce is tbh but it’s interesting to find someone else who dealt w this	pineapple_drink_milk	reply	na	na	na	0.0018534987466409802	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

Each person views sex differently and has a different drive and comfort level for it. Kind of a spectrum. And each person expresses their sexuality differently. Nothing wrong with any of it, save for the extremes of hypersexuality, which can harm people if care is not taken.

"Hey Guys I hope you are all doing well.I (24M) am a student in Scotland having moved here on a scholarship.Before becoming a student, I was a police officer having worked extensively in operations such as raids etc.Over my course of duty I have been stabbed, sustained injuries and have experienced so much stress it is very hard to put to words what I am feeling.Since I moved here I have had a pretty decent time and didnt have much trouble making friends although it is hard to have fun socialising since I became sober. I am blessed that I have made friends who understand (the don't know much about my past and I intend to keep it that way).

However, to this day, I still can't enter clubs withotu having a breakdown, loud parties or even sometimes when a bar gets too crowded I start dissociating and start zoning out. Ive had trouble sleeping for such a long time as well. I tried several times to get help for this but the NHS can't do much and I can't really afford to speak to someone. I am a fairly active person as well, I train alomost every other day in a very social martial arts club as well as doing hiking on weekends, i am a part of other social clubs in uni as well but I still feel so fucking alone no matter how hard I try.

Dating has been hard because over here in Glasgow, whenever I mention I am sober people would give a fake smile and pretend to have admiration but I know they are turned off by it. And I guess it sucks because people I meet organically and via dating apps it's hard for people to see a life with me I guess. I get night terrors alot and sometimes I would wake up screaming and that has scared people I have dated.Thing is I feel that I am normal most of the day, I have met people and we genuinely have a good time and there are connecitons we make it's just that no one sees anything long term with me.

Over the last year I was dating a girl and it was getting pretty serious(we met on a dating app and she was very understanding) but she broke up with me without a proper reason and I just supsect it's because I'm not enough, I can't join her when she wants to party etc I can't give her that or the fact that I'm not a decent guy and just damaged goods.

Over the past summer, one of my best mates killed himself back home and it's hard to cope because Ive had people kill themselves all my life growing up and it's like i cant get a break.My breakdowns have started getting more severe to the point where If i start having bad thoughts I try giving my phone to my neighbour or smth like that so I don't send anyhting hateful to the people I care about (this has happened before and it is damaging my relationshsip with my best friend whom I truly care about, I  have sent here some nasty texts when I wasn'r mentally sound and I tried reall yhard to apologize because I don't carry that hate in my heart, i am genuinely trying every day to be a better person but i have moments of weaknesses and i cant control them no matter how hard I try)

Really sorry If i am coming off as an asshole here guys but I am trying my hardest to be a decent person if not for myself at least for others but im am starting to feel like such a burden, my best friend has decided to start distancing from talking to me because she said I was weighing down on he and now im fucking alone and its so hard to wake up and carry on the next fucking day.I feel so inadequate as person despite what anyone else is telling me. I can't fucking talk to anyone because when I try opening up I can see their face turn to ""oh, he's doing the now"" and it just feels fucking awful.

Uniwork has also become really hard but i am still managing to keep myself afloat with the scholarship as I've had trouble focusing and more recently due to having a few concussions as well which I am doing my best to manage.

I don't know guys I feel like i have become a shell of a person I once was, no matter how hard I try I just can't find any peace."	NotGlenCampbell	post	22.298398809059986	male	White	0.9902034997940063	na	na	na	3	ptsd	failed

"Hey mate, I just read your post and I’m really sorry life is so overwhelmingly difficult for you right now. I want to reassure you that you’re not alone, and there are people out there who understand what you’ve been through and what it feels like to suffer so deeply almost nonstop. 

I truly admire and respect how much you’ve overcome, after all the violence and tragic loss in your life. You are not inadequate—your reaction to trauma is a totally normal human response to these horrific experiences. And you don’t come off as an asshole at all—you sound like an incredibly brave, strong warrior who has survived nightmarish trauma, and yet still finds the willpower to be a decent, loyal, honest, thoughtful person. 

Seriously, that’s a pretty amazing accomplishment! It says a lot about your character and your impressively courageous capacity for resilience. I’m really proud of you for refusing to give up and continuing to fight for yourself day after day. 

Trauma is extremely isolating when the majority of people couldn’t possibly comprehend what you’ve been through, nor do they have the emotional intelligence or empathetic capacity to help in the ways that you need. It’s really unfair and so fucking invalidating. You have every right to feel disappointed, betrayed, or abandoned. Managing expectations for how much support your friends and family can reasonably provide is hard, but you also absolutely deserve people who care about you and are happily willing to offer that emotional support too. 

It’s okay to cut out friends who don’t have your back, who do more harm than good, and who can’t offer reciprocal kindness and understanding. Personally, I would rather be alone than have unsupportive, unreliable, inconsistent, emotionally unavailable, or straight up toxic abusive people as friends & partners in my life. You deserve better! And there are definitely girls out there who will love and respect you despite the PTSD. Hard to find, but worth the wait. 

Does the police force you worked for provide any sort of benefits or line of duty support services for former officers? Does your university offer any campus counseling services? Can you find an in-person peer support group in Glasgow? I know how many barriers there are to finding a therapist and most have a long waitlist, but I really think you’d benefit from talking to someone irl about your experiences, who can help you feel seen and heard in a safe, secure environment— in addition to the help of online communities. 

I’ve found r/cPTSD really helpful too, (the c stands for complex) because repeated trauma that extends beyond a single one-off event will often manifest differently or more extremely than standard PTSD, and can require alternate strategies for healing & recovery. There’s a lot of online resources (websites, videos, cPTSD book recommendations, etc) too that can tide you over until you find more support in Glasgow. 

I know you’ll get through this! I’m just some random on Reddit, but I care about you. You’re important and your voice matters. I want you to succeed and thrive—at uni & in life. Hang in there mate, you will find peace eventually and it will get better."	NotGlenCampbell	reply	na	na	na	0.9902034997940063	strong	no	no	na	ptsd	failed

"I'm trying to press SA charges. My main witness who is supposed to also be pressing charges hasn't called after saying she would for almost a week. I tried to contact someone the detective said I could use as a witness becuse i thought he was on my side, he turned around and told my rapist that I was trying to press charges. He's claiming it was fully consensual and is having his mom harass my main witness. 

The guy who told him says it doesn't count because I said yes and he didn't force me down. He took me out into the middle of nowhere, begged, kept grabbing my hand, and argued with me whenever I tried to say no. After almost an hour I eventually said ""okay fine"" because it felt more like a threat than an option because he recently beat a woman and tried to kill her. He told me that wasn't an answer and that I needed to say ""yes"" so I said ""yes"". At his house durring the middle of my assault I tried to get dressed multiple times, but he would say something like ""what the fuck are you doing?"" And I can't remember what would happen after that.


Yes, I said yes. No, he didn't force me down, but I was extremely uncomfortable and he told me that he could tell.

Even though it wasn't ""forceful"" I was still bruised and it hurt to walk and was turamatizing. I felt so guilty.

Another one of his arguments is that I should just stop trying because I don't feel like he's a threat to me currently and I don't have enough evidence.

This is one of my exs friend who assulted me, at the time I was technically with my ex (also very abusive), but trying to leave him. This guy is making me out to be a horrible person for cheating on my ex by ""letting"" his friend rape me and not trying hard enough to stop him.

I'm so stressed and overwhelmed, in my heart I know it was assult but it's making me question at times if I'm overreacting. Almost everyone is treating me badly and calling me a liar.

"This comment comes from my experience as a former DV/SA prosecutor. I can’t comment on the legalities or give legal advice since I may not be familiar with your local laws and what not. But I can tell you about my experience and procedure where I’m from. 

What I’m seeing from your post is that he took you to a remote location, he is known to have assaulted and tried to kill a woman before, he begged and argued with you for an hour to have sex with him, told you that you needed to say yes, and you were afraid of him so you said yes. This is what we call in the legal community coercion by fear. This does not equal consent. 

Did the case get sent to a prosecutor yet? Or are you talking to a detective at this point?
Where I’m from the police/detectives take witness statements from everyone and then all that information is submitted to a state prosecutor who makes the decision as to whether to authorize the charges and a warrant. So whoever is talking to the detective wouldn’t necessarily be a “witness” when it comes to court. The detective isn’t the one who decides what charges get pressed and what don’t. It’s a prosecutor and also separately by a judge for authorization of charges. 

The prosecutor then submits the legal charges to a judge who ultimately approves them or not. It’s based on the standard of probable cause. You saying you were assaulted and coerced into saying yes out of fear would typically be enough to authorize charges where I’m from but I worked for a very trauma informed office and not all offices have the training I received. 

But I also worked in a busy system with a large backlog so sometimes “not in custody” cases could take months before they even cross the desk of a prosecutor. Our office was very underfunded.  

I guess my point is that it’s not the detective who decides about the charges. So just say your piece and say it well to the detective, and then it’s a waiting game about the actual charges. If you have any doubts about the viability of your initial statement to the police/detective maybe look into some local domestic violence/SA advocacy organizations and they may be able to help you remember all the facts and how to communicate them. A lot of times people who went through a trauma like you have can’t communicate what actually happened in an effective way which leads to problems with charging. I remember a lot of times interviewing victims and getting new information from what was in the report. So then I have to call the detective and have them re-interview the victim to make a supplemental witness statement in order to support the charges for the judge. 

Anyway. Don’t be scared if a bunch of people are talking to the detective. You said “everyone thinks I’m lying” but the people you need to convince are the prosecutor’s office not the police and certainly not the perpetrator or any of his witnesses. Don’t think about what everyone else is saying to the detective just make damn sure you clearly explain the situation to the detective. 

I hope this information was helpful in some way.  I’m so sorry what you are going through, and you are so brave and wonderful for pressing charges.

"Oh my god, I've been there. Actually I'm still there. I came out the other side with only about 4 people who truly believe me and stuck with me. It's so much easier to stick with the abuser because they're dangerous and people likely dont want the same thing happening to them. It's far easier for people to just stay where it's safer.

But those people who think you're lying, they weren't there, and they don't know what happened. They are cowards and genuinely karma does hit them. My rapists best friend's relationship ended after I made a complaint about him getting involved and witness intimidation. Karma did get him and I dont think he knows that I did take that complaint further than our college, I did take him to the police as well. It showed that I'm not being pushed around here, and you're doing the same.

My top advice for you is to get some noise cancelling headphones. The second I leave my flat, they go on and I walk through the street completely oblivious to anything they might be saying about me.

I sent my detective screenshots of that guy my rapist is friends with say that he believes my side of the story but it isn't worth pressing charges because no one will take it seriously.

I’m a detective who investigates DV/SA and this information is all 100% correct.  I’m sorry for what happened to you.  You likely have a country Crisis Center/Advocacy Center that could provide you with resources and counseling.  The cases can unfortunately move slowly.  I always try to move as fast as I can but sometimes that’s still pretty slow.  Keep after it.  Call for status updates.  Communicate by email because the law requires those emails to be retained.  Also call if the have recorded lines. You will want a record of what they tell you.  Just keep on them until the case is turned over to the prosecutor and then keep after the prosecutor until you get an outcome.  I wish you the best.	asillylilrat	reply	na	na	na	0.9986562728881836	strong	no	no	na	ptsd	failed

I was sexually assaulted by my ex also and was told the same thing. I've been through so much abuse throughout my life. Rape from 2 and molestation from 4 other people. There's always been some sort of excuse. CPS, the police, and friends/family all looked the other way. Everyone is against SA until it's someone they care about or think highly of.

I’m frustrated to hear the detective is putting that on you.  It’s not your job to coordinate witnesses.  You should give a list of names and contact info and the detective should reach out to them.  That helps preserve the integrity of the investigation and also doesn’t give uncooperative witnesses a heads up to what they will be talking about.  If you aren’t having any luck with the local agency, you can also reach out to the state police.  Sometimes a higher echelon agency being made aware of it will speed up the response time and make the detective working the case more attentive.

"The police made a right mess of it, and I also decided to take the route of taking my college through the complaints procedure and union stuff because they told me 'they couldnt be seen to be helping me' which is disgusting. So I've decided that it most likely wont go to court, but I can get justice in those other ways.

My abuser was actually arrested 6 months before for the same thing and works with kids, he fucked right off when he caught on the something was going on, which really says all you need to know. But he didn't have a probation officer because he just keeps getting away with it.

I found peace in other ways than the justice system. I found a new group of people, I joined the peer group at my local domestic abuse shelter (he also had those charges), my college recently had a me too kind of thing after a student suicide and a lot of SA victims came forward and protested, I was one of them.

I also got to a place where I felt that I was ready to talk to someone who was there the whole way with me, and saved me in my dark place. I actually felt a little less scared when they were around, and I discussed being more than friends with him. I think he'll say no but I reached that point with him where I felt ready, which says a lot. Time really heals so much, and I'm one year on now and I am a totally different person to who I was. I went from me, to a shell of a person, to hell and back and now to someone with more confidence and self-respect. It's a whole process but time just really helped to make it somewhat manageable.

That really shouldn’t be a problem.  I can count the number of witness interviews for SA investigations I’ve done by phone on zero fingers because that’s just not how it’s done.  Those are in-person interviews.  This is a pretty puzzling way to investigate a SA.  You can’t do it from your desk.  There are a million open source resources, as well as law enforcement databases that can provide addresses and phone numbers.  You shouldn’t be doing any leg work for the police.  You should be getting counseling and advocacy.  In my professional opinion, you should reach out to the state police.

I’m not saying it’s not prosecutable.  But there is just a way that these things are handled.  Anytime something goes outside the accepted investigative practices, things get stranger in court.

This paragraph seemed significant for people who post asking why they keep repeating bad choices;  
""Van der Kolk set out to determine what kind of physiological system could account for this type of “body memory.” In an extraordinary paper from 1985, he proposed the first neurobiological model for PTSD, one that could explain why trauma victims so often return to situations in which the traumatic experience will likely repeat. Freud had called this the “repetition compulsion.” When animals are continually subjected to inescapable shocks, it triggers a stress response that includes the release of endogenous opioids as an analgesic. When the stressor ends, van der Kolk hypothesized, it could cause an opioid-withdrawal effect, which the stressed subject might try to fix by seeking reexposure to the stressor. Perhaps, he posited, chronic exposure to stress created trauma junkies addicted to the high of endogenous opioids. Maybe this was why, for instance, abused children often grow up to choose violent partners."""	antiqueembryo	reply	na	na	na	0.9922881126403809	no	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

I’ve been having repetitive dreams about confronting my ex and gently asking about what he did to me and trying to see if he could see that what he did to me was wrong. Last night, I had the same dream but this time when he acknowledged that what he did was wrong, I felt overwhelmed with this feeling of validation. It was so strong that I felt myself wondering why it meant so much to me. Since waking up, I’ve been trying to think about why I feel like I need my abuser to know that what he did was wrong- and I still haven’t come up with an answer.

It’s because you want to know it really happened and it wasn’t your fault. Abuse is usually full of confusion and no closure. Our brains like to close the loop.

Closure can be important. It can feel like closing the book of trauma and writing something new. As one who will never have closure. I wish I could understand what that might feel like.

"I think a lot about this too. Obviously it's a form of validation which I think demonstrates how insidious abuse is. It might be a cognitive distortion to believe that getting that validation makes us feel like it's more difficult for them to continue abusive behavior.

"Right before what happened to me in the military, to get me fully medboarded out i was assaulted in a lesser way in front of about 150 drunk coworkers. Someone ripped my jacket off of me and slapped my a$$ which left a handprint shaped bruise. One of them reported it, and an investigation was conducted not by my choice. I cooperated… reluctantly. The guy who assaulted me had done other things like pushed his way into my barracks room before and i didn’t really want to delve into the details. It did impact how other people around me treated me, which left me in a very vulnerable state. That resulted in me receiving a very formal letter saying that i deserved to be treated that way, and that I led this guy on because i decided to be around him while he was drinking(i only was there to escort someone who had alcohol poisoning out… I was the only sober person around).

PTSD is a lifelong battle. Yes, you will be wrestling with closure and what ifs for the rest of your life. Even if you obtained some apology you would find yourself wrestling mentally for some other, almost unreachable goal to try to soothe you. This is why it’s important to learn your coping mechanisms now instead of wasting your own time searching for something that won’t help you at all.

Disclaimer I am in no way asking for medical advice, I just want to see if others have had a similar response. I was diagnosed with ptsd when I was 18 and I'm 27 now. I just started working on my emotional abuse trauma in therapy recently, from my childhood. Due to circumstances out of my control I am living with my family (who really don't understand boundaries) anyway my uncle started to rehash my childhood trauma cause by the caretaker I lived with when I was 8 to 14 years old, I told him immediately I can't talk about this and started hysterically crying, my uncle got annoyed and said it affected me too I have a right to my feelings after I had said I don't want to talk about it. So I got up and went in my bathroom (scince my bedroom doesn't have a lock) and continued to cry sitting on the bathroom floor. I felt like I couldn't move all I could do was sit there and cry. Even after all I could do was sit there for two hrs I guess it was the only place I felt a little safe. I felt so much fear and all I could do was sit and cry. Has anybody had an experience after being trigger where they feel paralyzed?  This has never happened to me before.

"Let me just preface by saying my childhood wasn’t the worst and I really think my very young parents tried their hardest with what they had at the time.

 My mom’s dad was abusive mentally toward her very badly and she still carries that with her to this day and it seems like it affects her ability to empathize with mental health issues of mine. Her dad was a narcissist so she sometimes tends to display narcissistic behavior as well. I love her very much and I know she feels the same but something that both of my parents did to me has been re-playing a lot on my mind recently and I just need to vent. 

I’ve always been a very hypersensitive kid who was afraid of everything. Looking back, a lot of it could be blamed on my then undiagnosed neurodivergence. I cried a lot and threw tantrums when I was feeling overstimulated like a lot of autistic children do. However, instead of handling it by taking me to a therapist and getting to the root of why I was displaying abnormal fear to everything they kind of just treated it like a joke. One time I remember when I was around 4 or 5 I was having a particularly bad tantrum and I got sent to my room alone and just sat there and cried and cried for what seemed like hours. Then all the sudden, my dad and mom come through the door and began recording me screaming and crying while they’re laughing at me. I remember at the time feeling so upset and betrayed. I was just a small child crying and instead of comfort I received belittlement from my own parents. Both of them! I think I brought it up years later once and asked why they did that and their response was “we were stressed by your constant crying so we sometimes just needed to make light out of the situation.” Who tf does that?? Looking back now at 22 it all makes sense where my distrust of speaking up about my mental health comes from. 
What’s even sadder is that it’s such a core memory that it’s hard to even remember the good things about my childhood anymore at my age. 

I struggle so much with trust issues and telling anyone about what I’m feeling because I never had a safe space to express myself. Even as a teenager I was always just told to get over it. I would spend hours in my room depressed and was not even checked up on ONCE. They just didn’t seem to care or notice. Now that I’m old enough to realize what they did was really messed up, I can’t help but think that it’s their fault for the reason I’m so distrusting and detached emotionally from a lot of people and even myself.  I relive this memory day after day recently and so many little things trigger the memory that it’s hard to cope and forgive my parents. I almost feel hatred toward them now that I’m older. I know this isn’t the worst thing to ever happen to a child but it effects me so much and I don’t know what to do to fix myself and my trust issues."

I'm very lucky that I have some good supports, but someone I thought I could rely on, and one of my supports, just told me to ""get the f*ck over it"". 

I've spent 18 months just trying to come to terms with what happened and the ensuing court case, let alone getting over it.

"This is what helps me: Imagine sitting with a sick/elderly loved one in the hospital because they are unwell. That's basically what our past/traumatized self is. We need to learn to do that with ourselves too. It's an act of compassion. 

If it was someone else, we would sit quietly, chat a little to be polite if they want to (talking to yourself the same way is ok because we do this work alone). We sit quietly when they are tired. We don't sit and pick them apart. We are there for them. We don't try to force anything or badger them to get up and get well. We don't fly into hysterics. We are there so they are not alone, but that doesn't mean we make a big fuss, entertain them, enable them, or exhaust them because that wouldn't be helpful. We control our reactions because it would be inappropriate to have a melt down when someone needs hospice or respite! We just remember to stay gentle and patient.

We can read or do a puzzle as long as it isn't something that distracts us so much that we miss it if they ask for a glass of water or a snack - we are there to provide care but not to suffer along with their suffering: they need to borrow our strength. We can still cry with them from a place of compassion tho. If things get intense, it's best if we leave and let the professionals have space to take care of the crisis. We can only do so much and we don't want to make anything more complicated. When the time we agreed to spend is up, we move on with life trusting that everything will be taken care. It is no longer ""our shift"" to provide comfort/compassion. We leave the emotional burden of caring for an infirmed person behind in the room and softly close the door until it is time to come back. This is when it's appropriate to have a little cry (in the bathroom or our car) about how hard it is and how much it sucks to see someone we love suffer and have to do extra work to help them heal or grieve that we are loosing them. It's frustrating! It's heavy! It's doing the most! 

I hope this made sense... It's not an easy thing to explain without sounding crazier than I am. It's more of a metaphor for the spirit of how you do it - it's not really something I actively fantasize. It's not a dissociation, maladaptive daydreaming or compartmentalization thing. It's more of a trick to get myself into the emotional state necessary with difficult emotions: ""What would I do if I had to sit with someone else who was struggling and needed care and support to heal?"""

"That’s really difficult, I’m sorry you’re going through this. 

To be honest, I would be weary of people who believe PTSD is only caused by certain kinds of events. It could be that they have a lack of understanding of how trauma works, and sharing resources can help with that. I’ve found the book The Body Keeps the Score to be helpful in explaining how trauma stays in one’s body, years after an event. I also find reading memoirs to be helpful in trying to understand other people’s lived experiences of how different kinds of trauma effect people.

"So back story I was in a verbally abusive marriage for 24 years. Everyday I heard you are stupid, that I was useless or that I would be nothing without him.

Now before I met him I owned my own home and business. I traveled and had a new car. I was an independent women that took no crap from a man.
But as we all know our past trauma can attract a predator.
My mom had cancer, I lost my dad at 15, and I was raped and had to endure an abortion all in the spam of 3 months. I fell into alcohol and drugs for years. I meet him as I was turning my life around.

When my mom suddenly died I realized that life is too short and I no longer wanted to be miserable. I planned, I went for therapy and finally walked away from a large lifestyle but I didn't care my happiness and peace of mind mattered more.
Fast forward 9 years doing my own business but decided to take a job with amazing benefits and retirement as working for yourself you have none. 

I've been there 6 months and things seemed great you know the love bombing stage. Then the real person came out from my boss, a women no less. 

She has degraded and deemed me in the last month. Nothing I do is right. She is condescending and puts me down at every turn. 
I have had my PTSD come back full swing. I even went to therapy as I know I am getting triggered and want to learn how to deal with it. 
I have done breathing exercises, I keep telling myself this is not my husband even starter taking pills for the anxiety but nothing is working.
Yesterday I lost it when she criticized me and made me phonetically speak out a name I couldn't pronounced like I was a 3 year old.

This brought back all these things from my marriage and I came home and cried. I don't think I want to be at a job that triggers me every day.

You're not alone.

You don't owe her a notice, in fact, if you give her one, she'll either torture you during the ""notice period"" or fire you on the spot.  Think of it like creating a ""safe exit plan,"" and email your intent to never return from your home.

Nothing fancy, nothing elaborate, nothing that reveals you ""have the goods on her"":

In the meantime, as long as you're there, save documentation in case she tries to gaslight you at your new job.  If there's emails, print them out.  Record any phone calls you're able to record.  Document, document, document.  Keep a written log of her abuse.  Really, handwriting in a notebook is best, because then it doesn't look like you created a bunch of stuff all at once.  Handwriting, different moods, pens, even the way you're writing that day demonstrates creation/movement over time.

Know that her abuse is coming no matter how well you perform, so you may as well start using that time to do whatever you can get away with to find another job, instead of trying to please her and/or promote her position/company.

If you're a high performer, your high performance might be why she's targeting you, seeing you as a threat to her position.  Be mediocre, be gray:

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/grey-rock

So if she tells you to do X, you work on X, slowly, don't deliver an excellent X, but a mediocre X.  Try to get off of her radar until you can find a new job.

I know it goes against the grain of a high performer, but again, YOUR HEALTH COMES FIRST.

Do whatever you feel is best for your health, but as someone who has dealt with some massively abusive bosses, it feels good to skull fuck them. You are not powerless as their direct report. Play games with her. I used to stare at my boss' forehead, I asked her if she had a drinking problem, I was always polite but mean spirited, think high school. She had a complete meltdown and got demoted. For me, it was an opportunity to find my voice again after my mom died. It felt good hurting her, that was an unexpected part of my grief recovery process. You don't deserve to be hurt, but she does, and it can be tremendously gratifying to feel the target's pain.

"You're welcome!

Reading over it, I forgot to mention that it's totally worth it to ask for an attorney's help in constructing any termination email, in such a way that if she tries to gaslight you to a new employer, she was warned of the legal consequences of doing so.  

This is also why you need to secretly document her abuse of you.  An abusive person won't stop unless they feel they have to, so, warn, sue, and have evidence of prior abuse.  Some states allow secret recordings, some don't.  Check the laws in your location.  

An attorney need not necessarily file a lawsuit before they attempt any negotiation for a settlement.  Lay people shouldn't attempt it on their own, because attorneys know how to avoid negotiations crossing over into ""extortion.""

"TW: rape, FtM healthcare.

I'm a trans man with sexual trauma. Unfortunately I am also well overdue another smear test. I keep putting it off because I have no idea how to cope with it, how to get through it without days of suffering afterwards.

The first one I had hurt a lot. The nurse laughed at me when I got scared and said it was hurting me. It bled afterwards, she didn't tell me this would happen - imagine how upsetting and scary that is for a man who doesn't have periods anymore. 

The last time I had an exam was after a rape two years ago. I had an infection from my abuser. It hurt so much to have the speculum put in, it was so terrifying and distressing and I feel panicky just thinking about it. It always hurts so much. They didn't laugh at me and they stopped when I started howling, but they were so cold to me. No one told me it would be a male nurse. There was no comfort. 

I'm sexually active and I know these tests are important. I'm terrified of them finding cancer or precancerous cells. I'm terrified of not finding out until it's too late. But it's so retraumatising having to put myself through it. I don't know how I can cope. I want to cry and scream and tear myself apart at the thought of laying in that chair again.

I don't know how I'm supposed to get through this."	Lakehounds	post	27.023038295592805	female	White	0.9988057613372803	na	na	na	5	ptsd	no prediction.

Do you have friends who can recommend a local clinic that's more understanding and less cold? 
I am cis-female and I hate these exams as well and only get through them by dissociating.

"I don't have any friends locally, the sexual health clinic was supposed to be understanding bc I told them I was male and traumatised to begin with, but the only acknowledgement that got was the chaperone whispering ""oh is this THAT patient?"" To the gyno when she came in...
The pain is caused partly by my body tightening up when they try and put anything inside, so it's...forcing open muscles that very firmly want to stay closed. The brush thing they use just kind of scrapes and it's very sensitive so idk if pain medication will even touch this.
I have one diazepam I can use for absolute emergencies (I can't get a prescription for another one) but I don't know how that will affect me and how 'sober' I'll be during, idk if that'll make it worse. My partner would have to come with me if I take that, cause I can't drive on it.

Another stupid suggestion: have you heard of rosen method bodywork? It focuses on releasing tension in the body caused by trauma.

"(18) I still live with my abuser. I’ve been busting my ass at work and outside of it just to make ends meet and hopefully eventually leave this hellhole. I developed stomach ulcers (not caused by infection, apparently) twice, and this second time around it was so bad the acid reducer didn't work and I had to be prescribed five pills (one prescription strength acid reducer and 4 pills I have to mix into a slurry before every meal). Did I mention I can’t really take painkillers at all? I get triggered every single day, multiple times a day, and can barely manage to calm down if I do at all. I went looking for a therapist after my last trip to the ER in May. By the way, my abuser so kindly decided to tell me her opinion on how the ordeal was “inconsiderate” to her because I didn’t tell her where I was going after needing to call my cousin to drive me. Beforehand, she refused to take me to the ER every single time I asked in the past. The psychiatrist there said I’d need weekly, intensive therapy to recover, and then I went back to therapy to ask for more sessions only to be told “I’m moving positions, I can put you on the waitlist. It's four months long. Want to go to this CBT group?” She also decided to share her 100% unwelcome stance on asexuality before I left, which triggered me for weeks, because of my childhood sexual trauma (which I recently figured out I’ve got as well). I don't even want to get into that, but she basically kept trying to pressure me into having sex. Which is disgusting. Please stop. No means NO. 

I've been looking for therapists outside of Kaiser (fuck Kaiser) who I can use the money I make from my minimum wage job to hopefully provide some relief to this chaos I call my life. My dad tells me to forgive my abuser, telling me we should “get along better.” Then, he starts divulging all the details of his divorce with her to me completely non-consensual. Also, I am very likely a trans guy but haven't had the time or energy to figure that out, even though it affects me significantly because I’m just trying to survive. Also, it leaves me another handicap when looking for a therapist. I have little to choose from because people don't want me to exist. I went to a psychiatrist and she prescribed me Zoloft, which, fine…whatever it could help. I’m out of options. There’s a side effect? Oh, what’s that? Nausea and stomach problems.

Kill me. 


“It gets worse before it gets better.” I don’t need it to get worse. I need it to get better right now. Oh, and I started my period today, which is the straw that broke the camel's back. Remember when I said I can’t take painkillers because of the ulcer? 

I'm so tired I can barely move. I feel physically ill. I've been getting rides to one of those IV clinics every month (which I pay out of pocket for) just to keep myself on life support since I can't go to the hospital. I eat most of my meals at work. But right now I don't feel like I can push through to do anything. 

I know there are other ways to help period pain if absolutely necessary, but I tend to get triggered and sent into flashbacks if I try that. Even if the pain goes away I feel so exhausted I’m like a husk. 

I don't know what to do. I don't feel like I can take care of myself right now. I'm also underweight and have a hard time eating because of my stress. Aside from the ulcer, it ALSO makes me nauseous and loses my appetite. 

I really don’t want to go back to inpatient because I experienced trauma there too. A lot of my other family members are abusers themselves aside from my cousins. I’ve also got OCD. Kickass combo as in it kicks MY ass into oblivion.

I believe that I have cptsd and ptsd, I'd love to get put on something that works but have bad experiences with all the meds I've tried. Anything that increases Seratonin even half of the lowest dose of all the different kinds I've tried make my pupil huge, make me manic or depressed or both and feel sick almost as if I'm OD'ing. I've tried mood stabilizers and they make me feel like a zombie or sleep for days. I've tried Wellbutrin, it sort of worked for a month but stopped even after a dose increase. I've taken kalonapin and it helped all the obsessive thoughts and I feel more normal, however I spiral downhill really quickly and get even more numb than usual and end up doing things I shouldn't and pushing everyone away. I'm so sensitive to medication and it sucks.. Does anyone have experience with other types of meds and had success? I could also be autistic, but not formally diagnosed. Idk if that matters.....

"Same here. My brain & body cannot tolerate any thc or cbd. I'm very glad it helps so many out there, but it's like a poison to me.

Also, it's incredibly frustrating that the medical establishment these days wants to treat anxiety, pain, and/or sleep issues with SSRI's. These are extremely powerful medications that *do* work quite well for very specific issues. But there *are* meds literally designed for anxiety, pain, and sleep. 

A good friend of mine who is an RN...they were  diagnosed with anxiety & sleep issues; nothing else. No personality disorders, mood disorders, etc. Their doctor put them on SSRI's for the sleep & anxiety. It was absolute hell for them. The meds flipped their brain around & they felt truly crazy for the first time in their life; the SSRI's increased their anxiety & insomnia 10-fold. Then they had to wean off it...obviously could not go cold turkey, so they were then stuck on the meds for quite awhile, tapering down. 

Anyway, just wanted to say, you aren't alone. I was on kalonopin a long time ago, and that med didn't work well for me at all. I'm diagnosed with severe anxiety.

That said, if that's the total treatment you've been prescribed, it's not going to be helpful. Therapy and other classes of drugs are more appropriate as a primary treatment.

"I am writing this in the hope that someone here has some insights or experiences that may be able to set things a little in perspective. I learned recently a that family member (not close) died. My memories of him are primarily keeping away from grabby hands forced intimacy and such, and later, batting his wandering arms away from younger cousins.

After he died this summer, I thought it would feel like a little detail in my life, a sigh of relief. I went completely numb. Afterwards, i felt relief and anger. It was like a veil had been lifted from me. It felt disproportionate to the encounters I've had with him. I realise he's affected my life more than i thought, based on the feelings i am left with at the news of his death. 

However, I also feel there are some vague, not clear memories from being very young. I don't feel those memories are clear enough to be reliable. It is like I ""feel"" something happened, but I don't know exactly what.  I have memories of a house, and a room i hated to go into when we visited as kids. I remember the carpeted floor and a pool table. I have a feeling of dread associated with the room and yesterday when I tried to describe it, I felt physically sick.  

Could something have happened that affected me that I don't remember properly? Is my mind playing tricks on me? Is this ""normal"" for PTSD?  
I don't know what to think and I don't know what to do.

"hello everyone ! i have a question 

TW : human trafficking - dealer 

some context about the « trauma » : in january 2022, a dealer came in town to kill one of my close friend after she scammed him. he didn’t kill her at the end, but he put her into a human trafficking thing.

it lasted several months, and in september 2022 i started therapy which lasted a year. i think about this period of my life everyday (but without an emotional distress) and yesterday i noticed that i don’t have memories of january / february / march 2022. i only remember 3 traumatic events but i am not able to tell when it happened (was it the same day, the same week, the same month ?) and what happened outside from those events (for example : when did the dealer arrive ? when did he create the apartment ? when did he talk to me ?)

in one hand i feel it’s normal because the memory tends to fade away with time (it was one year and half ago) and i did a lot of therapy just after so it was « treated », but on the other i have this strange feeling of fog concerning this period of time + i feel like i remember the months before it happened better than january/february/march 2022.

could it be a type of amnesia ? or is it just normal memory loss ? maybe i am just overreacting

"Mental health consultant here.

Focusing on a full cure or healing 100% isn't helpful because it's not measurable. Also your mental health is a continuum, not a switch so you'll have good days, bad days and everything in between. Even people who feel they have healed 100%will have periods of poor mental health.

"I have had some success with a sort of DIY exposure therapy toy.

It's just broadcasting software and YouTube but it's been really helpful.

I've been talking to doctors and researchers about it.

The upside is also the downside. It costs nothing to make. If someone saw this as a money making endeavor I'm sure things would move much more quickly.

Here is the gist:

Play a mildly triggering video then play music in a second window that makes you sad.

For me the fear sticks but sadness fades

So for example I have been struggling to put the stress of the civil unrest in Portland behind me. I found a mildly triggering video that felt similar to watching live streams of the riot (I watched because I knew a number of the folks who were there).Then I sort of made myself a music video that made it feel sad instead of scary.

I am autistic and as such a visual thinker. Closing my eyes at bed time means reliving the images that my brain was worried about.

I have seen a significant reduction in intrusive thoughts.

I'd be happy to link a how to but I am hesitant as I am not a licensed therapist.

I think I'm gonna start smoking more weed and see if it gets rid of all dreams like it used to for me.	BlackBear300621	reply	na	na	na	0.9993302822113037	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
Are you really asleep or does it happen in the process of waking up and/or falling asleep? Like, are you sort of half awake? If so, it might be sleep paralysis blending into the dream. That means your muscles are frozen (like they are during dream sleep) but your brain isn't completely asleep. It feels absolutely horrible and panicky. If that's the case, avoid sleeping on your back. Sleep paralysis mostly happens in that position.	BlackBear300621	reply	na	na	na	0.9993302822113037	no	no	strong	na	ptsd	failed
I have this too, all the time. The thing I want to get away from isn’t always the same, but I’m always completely unable to move in the dream despite desperately wanting to. I’ve also had sleep paralysis a few times, which is similar, but sometimes it’s not that and it’s just a normal dream. I used to be afraid to sleep at night because of it, and still am sometimes though it’s a little less common now than it used to be.

I never really truely sleep unless I take a good amount of Seroquel. I am usually a pretty active in my sleep, but maybe it is sleep paralysis. My brain would freak out if it can’t move. I know I panic in any kind of restraint or in confined spaces with other people. Part of my trauma was being trapped.

"I'm the same way, I panic under weighted blankets etc. But sleep paralysis is terrifying regardless of trauma, so if that plays into it it's going to make it worse. All kinds of sleep disturbance can make it more likely.

When you're active in your sleep, it's during deep sleep, not during REM sleep (dream sleep). In REM sleep, your muscles are paralyzed. But sometimes your consciousness can be sort of awake while your body isn't."	BlackBear300621	reply	na	na	na	0.9993302822113037	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

"I only get sleep if I take Seroquel. 

If I don’t I lie there for hours with hyper aware of every minor feeling or discomfort in my body. Especially my belly or my thighs. 
My mind finds any small noise or movement in the room and I can’t sleep. Everything keeps me awake.

I end up drifting in and out of conscious uncomfortable and anxious until about 6am each morning when I end up falling asleep till 10 out of shear exhaustion. And wake up full of sweat from nightmares.

But if I take the Seroquel I am mentally dulled and like a zombie the next day. It makes it hard to work with my mind as it is so slow and lethargic despite the sleep I get.

"England specific diagnosis help needed!

Trigger warning here about COCSA!

After England specific advice and your experiences relating to the following. But first I want to thank everyone in this sub it’s my first time posting here but I’ve been lurking a while reading and it really helps me!

I was sexually abused for several years period by an older Family member about (6-7 years older) around a year ago after a lot of denial I had a bit of a break down and was initially diagnosed with depression and anxiety however my Doctor (not my GP but a doctor working at my GP) suggested they felt I had a long term mental health condition in their opinion it was likely PTSD so I needed to be assessed so I was referred to the mental health team.

I then had an assessment by a mental health nurse who concluded they think I have PTSD or maybe even CPTSD but they weren’t able to formally diagnose me it would have to be a GP or another Dr level psychologist/psychiatrist. However my local authority Suffolk has really long waiting lists and as I have not physically attempted suicide (despite suicidal ideation and regular self harming behaviours) I would be on a waiting list that is 3 years long for a diagnostic assessment they also added that people have been on that list 10 years because those who have attempted suicide go to the top of the list. GP can’t diagnose me due to the appointments being to short for the assessment they want to do. 

 I understand the logic behind this but not having a formal diagnosis is chipping away at me since this appointment 2 nurse practitioners and another doctor have added suspected PTSD to my GP Records but the lack of certainty is a hang up for me. 

My Doctor has put me on 2 antidepressants which are helping especially with sleep as bedtime was often when my abuse would happen, but they feel I’m not ready for talking therapy yet (I do sporadically read books though highly recommend broken boys mending men it’s eye opening and helped me feel less alone), their logic is I should be more stable before I delve into much repressed and denied memories. 

A very kind relative has offered to pay for a private diagnosis I’m after advice and recommendations for this but also your experiences especially if you’ve done this in the UK. Also did you find a formal diagnosis more helpful? Having suspected PTSD feels stupid to say but I don’t feel I can say I have PTSD?

"I knew that I already had PTSD and I knew that transphobia was a thing when I started transitioning, but I never thought that the two would go so hand in hand. I started work the same day as my birthday, and I thought at least a manager or someone would say happy birthday since I already turned in a lot of documents with my birthday on it. Then I thought maybe they just didn’t look at it but then they even asked to see my drivers license didn’t even say anything. I know that’s a small thing to be upset about but it’s just kind of like cherry on top of a terrible year: I have been nonstop harassed and sexually harassed over being trans at workplaces and in public and I was also sexually assaulted on May. People will still randomly laugh at me and just generally treat me like a freak or a monster. The few times I was able to get my camera working for the call they’d look at me like I was gross and even right when I first joined they were already like “sigh…hi [my name].” Like you guys don’t even know me we’re just meeting and you already treat me like a pest. 

And I’m really upset because my twin doesn’t accept me, either so it’s been really hard celebrating my birthdays without her knowing that she doesn’t miss me the way I miss her. It also wasn’t until sometime in the afternoon when I told my friend about something that she was like “oh yeah happy birthday.” My mom sent me food so that was nice and after work I just passed out when I was waiting for it. I just hate always being so alone and feeling like any real support is so far away while no one around me has my back. 

I’m really glad to have transitioned but I never expected people to hate me so much and for the past couple of years to just add more to my trauma and PTSD I already had from my dad. I’m really glad that I did what I had to do for myself, but I don’t understand why it had to cost so much socially, emotionally, physically, and spiritually, and my life feels so meaningless sometimes like I’m just a waste of a person that’s been thrown out by cis people. I still mean what I said in my last post, but I’m just still really sad, and it’s in these moments that are meant to be happy that I just feel even more heartbroken.

And counselors always say to reach out to more people and focus on my hobbies to cope, but I do and they either just see me as a sex object or get bored/tired of me. I have tons of hobbies to fill the time and make me happy but I was thinking that one of them is partner dancing, and what’s the use if I don’t have anyone to dance with? It just makes me feel even more alone.

Just because trans people are brave or strong or whatever you like to call us, doesn’t mean we want to or should have to deal with never ending abuse and violence.(and by ourselves too)"	bubbles244434	post	23.310134568059297	female	White	0.9985861778259277	na	na	na	10	ptsd	failed

If you’re looking for advice, maybe try some queer groups in your area?

"I really understand where you're coming from. I'm also trans and have PTSD as a result of sexual assault. The way we're treated by society as a whole can be so re-traumatizing and the objectification we're subjected to is just horrendous. It can make it so hard to navigate any kinds of relationships, particularly with cis people. In my experience the best thing is finding other trans friends; I've found it does help significantly lessen the blow of being otherwise outcasted in society and difficulties with family. And I would really put emphasis on the trans part as opposed to cis queer people, as it seems like the support you need the most is in that area. The world can be a really frightening place but having a bond with people who understand you can be helpful in so many ways. 

Personally I met many of my trans friends at cosplay conventions and that's been my main support for around ten years now. My point is that there's a lot of places to find like-minded people outside of overly cis-dominated queer spaces. Putting yourself out there can be really hard but there's a fair amount of us out there and we need to look out for each other.

"I recently moved into my boyfriend's parents house to save some money. We were coming from our own one bedroom apartment where it was just us 2 and our 2 cats. My boyfriend was very accommodating to my noise sensitivity and over time, I even became accustomed to more noises because he worked with me on it. We lived there for a year, so I became used to our quiet, safe noised lifestyle. It's only been a week since we've moved into his parents house. We are living in his old childhood bedroom and that is the only space we have for ourselves. I love my boyfriend, but I also highly value my alone/quiet time. The only time I can have that is when I'm in the bathroom showering/taking a bath. This is a great resource, but I obviously can't be in the bathroom 24/7. Now, my boyfriend isn't making any noises out of the usual ones I've become accustomed to & on their own, it would be manageable for me. However, he has a loud family. I don't mean they talk loudly, but their actions are. I was raised in a household where everyone did their best to keep their noises to their own space (keeping the TV at a reasonable volume, shutting the door, etc.). His parents blast (and I mean so loud that I can hear the bass upstairs) the TV downstairs whenever they are watching something, they have to fall asleep while watching something (which I understand, I do as well, but I watch it on my phone so as not to disturb others) & they don't try to keep the volume down, so I hear the TV & muffled talking from it constantly. The past 2 days, something is going on with the A/C & it's resulting in this incredibly irritating constant squeaking noise. My boyfriend and I have our own A/C unit in our bedroom, but I can't even use that to drown out the noise, because our A/C unit provides its own irritating sound whenever it's turned on. The only sounds I can rationalize are the cats & my boyfriends brother. He's 12 & I can hear him playing roblox with his friends in the middle of the night, but that doesn't bother me. I broke down last night and told my boyfriend that I don't know if living here is a viable option for me. I feel so dumb because I'm considering moving out over noises? This would mean we wouldn't be able to save the money to be able to move out of state in a year. I just don't know if I can deal with this for a whole year. I don't want to constantly be wearing headphones, I want to feel comfortable in the place I live. Any tips? Any advice or feedback is appreciated. 

  
TLDR: Moved into bf's parents house after living by ourselves for a year, super overstimulated with noise, considering moving out. "	nymphnyx	post	24.908086485472243	female	White	0.9994437098503113	na	na	na	1	ptsd	no prediction.

"Hi everyone, I (25F) was diagnosed with PTSD a few years ago due to a really abusive childhood. I’ve been estranged from my father for over a decade now due to both physical and mental abuse, however recently I’ve started remembering things that have a more sexual tone. I keep doubting myself, and telling myself that I must just be overthinking things but it really has stuck with me. I don’t have any clear memories of being sexually abused, however I do keep remembering small fragments. 

For example: 
A few nights ago I was receiving oral from my boyfriend (who I’ve been dating since I was 16, and is the most incredible, sweet and gentle guy) when his beard started to rub up against my thighs and etc. This sensation INSTANTLY brought an image/memory to my mind of my father (who has always had a beard or beard stubble) doing the exact same thing, which then became really hard to mentally overcome and (obviously) completely killed the mood. I spoke to my boyfriend about it right away and he was super supportive. 

I guess I’m just really confused on what to think. I know I should speak to somebody professional about this; but the mental health system in Australia is really lacking right now and I’ll most likely be on a wait-list for months. I just really need to talk to someone with a similar experience, as I’m too embarrassed to talk to my family or friends about it in-depth. Any advice is appreciated.

"You can go to the doctor and get 10 appointments with a psychologist. Just make a double booking. I just got some last week.

I would suggest starting off with Carl Jung and shadow work. Dealing with the feelings and pain are going to be rough. Meditation can help put you in a non-reactionary state where you can observe these things when they come up, allowing you to process the events and associated feelings.

I had one at uni who was pretty awesome. The other one I have only seen only once but I am going back to him. When my doctor gave me the appointments, I asked for a psychologist that wasn't mainstream, because I am very spiritual in nature and didn't want to be talking to a close minded psychologist who would think my views were crazy.   


My doctor told me and they told me about Dr John Di Batista. He is currently based out of QLD but you can do the appointments over the phone or video iirc.  I haven't booked an appointment yet, but I know you don't have to go in person, he used to be here in Vic.

"Hi peeps,

Hope this is the right place for this post, apologies if not!

I work a full time job in finance that has a hybrid schedule (few days in office a week). 

I also was diagnosed with PTSD in my teens and, although I’m able to cope with it much better now that I’m in my 30s, it’s still something that causes disruption in my daily life

For example, I have insomnia and night terrors pretty regularly, which causes me to have pretty intense fatigue and brain fog most days. I also have anxiety 24/7, especially so around groups of people. My body tenses up all day in the office that every time I go in  at the of the day, I leave with a migraine and serious back and toothache. 

As you can imagine, I’ve requested to work from home quite frequently, but my company is putting their foot down and requiring extra measures to request working from home.

Both my psychologist and psychiatrist would like me to work from home full time and are willing to support an ADA request for accommodations from my work place. 

The problem is I am very afraid to put in this request and disclose my condition. I am the breadwinner of my family and am lucky to be able to work in this sector as my degree is in something totally different. I really enjoy what I do and the job provides well for me and my family. 

Also may be important to note, they just gave me a random raise a few weeks ago as a “thank you” for my work, which has also made me feel even more hesitant to put this request in.

I know the ADA is federally protected and employers must follow it; however, my parents are (visibly) disabled and growing up I saw how every company did everything they could to avoid hiring or accommodating them. 

I am privileged in that my disability is largely not visible, but I am very afraid of this blowing up in my face. I am afraid my company will behave different towards me, or try and find ways to make me want to leave the role without getting themselves in legal hot water. 

I guess I am looking for peoples perspective if they have gone through this process before. Especially if you worked in a sector like finance, where mental health is the last thing anyone in the company is interested in discussing. How did it go? Anything you wish you did differently? Worth it? Not worth it? Why or why not?

Thanking in advance for reading and/or providing your perspective 🙏"	Professional-Lake52	post	40.496203511090926	female	White	0.4278870224952698	na	na	na	10	ptsd	no prediction.

"Well… it didn’t go quite so well in the real estate and finance sector for me like you mentioned with your parents. 

However, I think it will depend on the accommodations you ask for. All I see here is you wanting remote work with a variable start time due to sleep disruptions which won’t cost the company really anything. 

I would recommend that your physician fill it out (maybe they can communicate with psych dr’s) so it alludes to a minor physical illness and I don’t believe your diagnosis needs to be divulged in the letter. Just the need for ADA accommodations and if you have just a therapist and psychiatrist turn it in it may be side eyed and taken stock of. I’d ask your primary care physician and maybe a therapist. Just my on the street/management minded opinion. You could also consult with an attorney which is probably what I would do in this particular scenario.

"The paperwork they gave for my medical provider to fill out did require that they fill out the diagnosis. But, this was only seen by the HR person handling the interactive process. I personally disclosed that I get migraine attacks at my interview because I didn’t want to work somewhere that wouldn’t be willing to accommodate me and my service dog. After getting hired I talked more in depth with the HR person about what accommodations I would need and that’s when I disclosed both my migraine disease and PTSD diagnosis. She then put the accommodations in writing to give to my supervisors. She sent me a copy beforehand but not all do so if you do decide on asking for accommodations make sure to ask they send it beforehand and tell them you would not want to have your diagnosis put on that letter. Since you already work there I would go directly to HR or even maybe briefly talk with a supervisor to tell them you have been dealing with a medical issue and you may need to put accommodations in place.

I don't want to be someone else. I don't want to look like someone else. But I feel disgusted with my own body. I feel like it doesn't even belong to me anymore. I sleep with a knife under my pillow because of the paranoia. I jump at everything. If someone does so much as tap my shoulder I get aggressive. I feel like a prisoner in my body. I want to escape but I can't escape my body. And for the first time in my life I don't want to die. I've made so much progress in other ways but this trauma never seems to leave me.

The physical violation washes off in the shower and you shed your skin every few days.

"[This VA study from 2022](https://academic.oup.com/milmed/article-abstract/188/7-8/e2227/6847541) evaluated the use of HBOT for PTSD with regard to veterans.

Perhaps try reaching out to one of the authors of the paper to see who their liaison at the VA was? I believe it's through the VA Office of Compassionate Innovation, but I haven't the faintest idea who the point of contact would be.

Edit - a little further investigation reveals that at least some of the authors work at the Sagol Center in Israel, so maybe less helpful than I thought, especially if you're one of the authors.

If that's the case, perhaps the Undersea Medicine laboratory at the VA, or maybe the National Center for PTSD which conducts research through the VA.

While the VA manuscript does make reference to our study, it's important to note that there have been subsequent data and publications since then. We are currently summarizing the results of a comprehensive, placebo-controlled trial that seems promising and will hopefully be published soon.
  

  
The issue at hand is that there are hyperbaric centers with a treatment that can help suffering veterans. We possess academic data supporting the effectiveness of this treatment.

"absolutely not!!!

There are studies and publications and some of the data that exists today was not existed during the VA review of the topic.

As previously mentioned, hyperbaric therapy for veterans with PTSD is currently being prescribed in Israel, supported by available data. In 2017, the VA also prescribed HBOT for veterans with chronic PTSD in Washington. However, it is crucial to emphasize the importance of using the appropriate treatment protocol and having a thorough understanding of how to address challenges that may arise during the treatment course.

Using inadequate protocols could lead to incorrect conclusions and risk losing the potential benefits of this effective therapeutic approach."	keren_db	follow-up	na	na	na	0.0016344323521479964	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

I won’t go into any details because I know it’s against community rules. But I don’t know what to do. I feel so exhausted from all of this.

"Your trauma is still valid, even if you feel like it’s your own fault. Survivors guilt and imposter syndrome are both pretty common with PTSD.

Are you in therapy? Taking any medications? It’s definitely important to bring this up with your care team. 

Maybe a sleep-time guided meditation could keep your mind from wandering and help you drift off into sleep? Or listening to an audiobook or calming music? I’d also recommend a weighted blanket, they do wonders for calming down the nervous system and reducing the physiological feelings of panic. A night time routine can also help to relax your body and prepare your mind for sleep - I find having a warm bath, a nice skincare routine and reading a chapter of my book before bed gets me into the right frame of mind for sleep.

"Tw talk about my bad experiences with mental health services, marijuana, and suicide.

I've talked about it with a therapist before and she told me I have ptsd, which makes complete sense, except she never actually made any record of diagnosing me with having ptsd and didn't actually work through it and teach me how to cope with it. I don't think she was wrong about that diagnosis, it was the only time I thought she was right about something, but she was not a good therapist. Tbh she was the final straw that made me lose complete trust in mental health services. 

I use marijuana to cope with the ptsd as well as other issues that cause me chronic pain. If I don't it becomes extremely difficult to live and I end up attempting suicide because my mental health gets so bad. Ptsd is one of the qualifying conditions for medicinal use in my state but I don't actually have proof that I have ptsd. 

If I go to someone to get a diagnosis do I have to tell them what my trauma was? I'm honestly just completely tired and done with talking about it. As far as I'm concerned I don't want to bring it up ever again. I'm tired of having to think about it. Speaking about what happened is just something I do not want to do.

Once they determine that, all the other criteria are symptomatic. Meaning they'll ask you a bit about your trauma, and a lot about how it's been affecting you.

Tell them in broad terms. If they need more specifics they'll ask. So like ""I was in an accident"" or ""I was abused"" or whatever the vaguest description is. They'll probably ask for a bit more than that, but you can always let them know you're not comfortable talking about it yet and would like to keep it as vague as possible.

my unsolicited advice here is, if you want to heal from this and attempt to move forward, stating your specific trauma is kind of the only way to succeed in doing that. 

my dad died by suicide and my PTSD experience is going to be totally different than someone who was violently attacked. or r**ed. or someone who watched a brutal car crash. or someone who got a limb torn off. 
if you want help, you’re going to have to get down to the root so that whoever you’re seeing can actually provide some coping skills to relieve you. in my experience, weed will only take you so far. and if your experience with marijuana IS like mine, it’ll make everything so much worse when you’re sober. or if you get too high. really just in general. 

does anyone enjoy talking about their traumatic experiences? fuck no. is it highly triggering, depressing, and sickening? yep. do i want to move on? without a doubt.

I had to talk a little bit about it, not in too much detail though. Just a brief overview of what it entailed. I was diagnosed with PTSD based off of my physical response to the discussion.

"I think most therapists who are good at dealing with trauma will not ask you to go into detail or relive what caused it. However, if they were really sticklers for the ""rules"" of diagnosis they may want to know what the type of event was that precipitated your symptoms.   


For example you might say something like ""I've been experiencing xyz symptoms following a violent assault in 2019"" and they'll probably ask you about the symptoms and stuff but not need more details about their origin for the purposes of diagnosis. You can look up the diagnostic criteria yourself and see more or less exactly what goes into making that diagnosis and what questions a professional would ask you."	1800CutAHoe	reply	na	na	na	0.9987688660621643	no	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
I was diagnosed with PTSD and have a medical cannabis card. It insanely helps me as well, mainly with going to stores and needing to be around crowds of people. I'm in the process of going through EMDR therapy and will take it during that time to significantly make it more easier to endure. It helps with appetite which is a struggle as well as nightmares and sleep paralysis. I hated having to talk to someone in detail about my trauma and what I went through. In the last 3ish years, I've seen 20+ doctors, therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, neurobehavioralist, etc. I'm dealing with social anxiety as well, which makes it even more difficult to talk about such personal things with a stranger. I've been seeing a therapist though now for almost three years and she helps me the most. It can be difficult to find a good therapist, etc. that you can trust and confide in. I believe to actually be diagnosed with something, you need to see a psychologist and they will do a diagnostic assessment. I could be wrong, but that's the process that I went through to be officially given my diagnosis. I hated having to tell such personal things to strangers only for them not to be a good fit for me but I found a good therapist and I'm working on healing. I'm sorry that you're dealing with all of this and I hope you find the right person to help. It's exhausting to have to talk about trauma and relive it in that way.

To get a diagnosis technically no because all the questions are just yes or no for instance “because of the traumatic event more days than not do you experience uncomfortable and unwanted feelings or emotions” but a therapist would likely be weary to diagnose without you essentially trauma dumping (which is what appointments are most likely going to be like a week In) because without the trauma dump they have no reason to believe you have ptsd.

Getting struck by lightning is actually fairly quick and painless. You probably saw convulsing, which is a body’s natural reaction to current. I don’t know if that’s a bit of a consolation or not. They also say that cardiac arrest is one of the least painful ways to go, so even with that angle it’s pretty ideal. The lifeguard didn’t see it coming, and didn’t feel pain, regardless of what it looked like. I almost got struck by lightning once.

"For every person it is different, but the main idea is that your body is reacting not according to the present, but replaying the reaction to a traumatic event or your usual trauma response if you experienced chronic abuse, neglect, torture, etc. It can be accompanied by hallucinations, nightmares or bodily reactions, but with cptsd it is mostly a certain state of mind and tensions in the body (faster hearth beat, muscle tensions, nausea and others) , also extreme emotions or lack there of. That's the thing about cptsd, you become so used to this, it is so easy to believe that this is just how life feels like. I think that ptsd and cptsd flashbacks are significantly different in this way. CPTSD flashbacks mostly does not have one traumatic situation to come back to. There are so many different instances or just constant state of fear, pain, guilt and grief that a person can feel all the reactions but not attach them to any specific situation. Especially if you have childhood ptsd, because up to a certain age our brains can not form clear memories, but our bodies remember emotional reactions. 

I am not a medical professional of any kind, but I can give you some examples from my experience. 

Depending on your usual trauma response smaller flashbacks might look like this: I dropped a pen at a meeting and it made a noise falling on the floor. I immediately start to apologize to everyone multiple times with a sinking panicky feeling in my chest. My knees feel weak and I think everyone is judging me, there is a strong desire to not exist or to self harm, I hate myself for being so clumsy and disturbing everyone. There are multiple thoughts running through my mind and i can hardly catch or understand them, extreme shame, fear of punishment or ridicule. 

When I thought about this situation later, I realized that the reaction was completely out of proportion. People at the meeting did not mind the pen, but were way more disturbed by my panicky apologizing. And after a long time I realized that this fawning reaction came from certain childhood situations and people who were not always so kind to me. So in that meeting, I was projecting the reaction I had then to the abuse and tragedy on this mundane situation even when I logically understood that nobody is going to hurt me because of a pen.  

In more extreme cases there can be visuals, hallucinations and other stuff. For me it is rarely that. I can not explain this logically, but when it's really bad, i feel like someone is garbing me from the back or that i am being wrapped in a plastic bag. There is definitely dissociation, restlessness. The whole world seems too loud, too bright, just too much... Racing thoughts, some memories. I start blaming people or blaming myself, my real memories merge with fantasies and i can hardly say what really happened and what is just my imagination. I can have hours and hours of conversations with people who hurt me in my head or sometimes even out loud if I am alone. I can not speak or react to others and the present world properly. Basically it just feels like you are not here anymore. At least not in the present. It's like my own terrifying pocket reality that replays chunks of my childhood and worst experiences in random order with some added fantasies I had as a child or still have now. For me it feels a lot like a panic attack, just lasts longer and is attached to what happened. 

Sometimes You can tell you are having a flashback by noticing your body, if your mind is too loud and disorientated. Some people in extreme cases are falling down, when they hear a certain sound or punching when approached from the back, but smaller things can be a sign too. For example, if you feel yourself bending and trying to be smaller for no apparent reason, if this is somehow connected to your experience, it can be a fawn response to a flashback or if your arms, legs or other body parts are starting to get numb that can also be a sign of a beginning of a flashback.

For me, no.  It’s not like a movie playing in my head, it’s a deep pervasive feeling that overtakes everything.  Physical and visceral.  At most, visually, it might be a flash of color (red usually for me).

My trauma is from a car accident. For me when acutely triggered I feel like I'm in the car. We are being spun and everything slows down. When severely triggered, I can go one of two ways, dissociate, unfocused, and basically stuck. The complete opposite of that I also can become very panicked, moving at hyper speed, everything and everyone is too much and I want to fight. So it really depends. My acute triggers have popped up while doing menial tasks and experiencing significant pain, or while spinning with my kids. Severe triggers happen in rush hour traffic, or lots of screaming like my kids did in the accident. What I have learned is there is no right or wrong way express how your triggers feel and for me the faster I accept that I am triggered the easier it is to get past. Finding good coping mechanisms and distractions appropriate for the setting are extremely useful for me.	ToyboxOfThoughts	reply	na	na	na	0.9937987923622131	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

Except the impulse isn't coming from a third person, it's coming from the illness PTSD that sits somewhere in my brain. 

It works the same with sensory flashbacks. One of my most severe ones is the feeling of grabbing an arm and the meat sliding off the bone while recovering a severely decomposed corpse from the ocean.

I have spent this entire time becoming so closed up and isolated throughout all of this, which is extremely out of character for me, but ever since that PTSD, flashback and all of the millions of ones that I’ve followed, all I have wanted to do is talk about it and write about it and help other people through it.

How commendable! I went into the healthcare field and it’s done my heart a lot of good. My psychiatrist, whom I adore, is pretty religious, which I am not. but that’s ok. She told me “you went through these terrible things to prepare you for what comes next in your life. As a nurse you will be so compassionate and it will be you who can hold these people, cry with them, hold their hand and do it without any judgment because you will truly understand how they feel” and that just resonated with me so much.

I have been going through this right now. I returned back to school and it’s been so hard to be around men. 1 guy in particular has been super nice to me and kind of changed how I view men. I unintentionally think they all have bad intentions, however this guy is friends with so many women and I can tell it’s genuine, he has a little sister and I just think he enjoys women more.

"I get this. I’ve been in multiple abusive relationships with men and the sound of a man yelling is a ptsd trigger for me that will lead to a panic attack. I have difficulty trusting men. I usually opt for female doctors/professionals although I now have a PCP who is a man and he is wonderful and listens to me very well. 

I’ve had difficulty sustaining romantic relationships with men. I am married again now and we are trying to work through my ptsd and my husband has been pretty good about it and is open to therapy etc. I want to have children so I’ve been pushing through on the issue. But even now I still have days where I am tempted to divorce him and just be alone. So we will see how this all plays out. Watch me get pregnant and have a son 🤣🤣

I think it’s important that you find a good therapist to talk to about it.  Maybe you can also find a good, calm man to be friends with or maybe a religious pastor if that’s your thing who can help desensitize you a bit. But I wouldn’t do that until you have the guidance of a therapist.

"TW: Mentioning of sex, porn, sexual assault, child

I believe I have been suffering from PTSD over something that I didn't realize affected me until now. I was shamed to talk about it, embarrassed, and even thought it could've been a delusion and something that didn't happen. However, I'm trying to come to terms. 

I was unfortunately introduced or saw porn at a very young age. I witnessed my fathers search history and saw pictures in his camera roll. I also witnessed him watching something about it on TV. One time, when I was trying to fall asleep with my parents (I was like 6) I thought I heard him touching himself (not to me or anything, but in the same room to something else). The last part I didn't see happen but I thought it did or sounded like it, maybe it didn't at all, I don't know, I was so young. 

No, nothing happened to me directly when I was a child. My parents are very loving, and never even laid hands on me in terms of spanking. That is why I thought these minuscule things which are normal for adults to do wasn't the cause of anything, but I truly think it was, because I was so young and didn't understand. I think it made me feel disgusted of anything sexual, and scared of sexual things. I was later sexually assaulted as a teen, which kinda just set it all off even more. I was also cat-called as a pre-teen a lot, which scared me.

I have dreams of being taken advantage of by family members/intrusive thoughts (I have ocd), I never want to have sex and feel disgusting when I do, it's hard for me to also show love in relationships. It's a mixed bag of reasons for all of this.

Again to reiterated, nothing happened to me directly. I don't believe my parents know I even was witness to any of this and don't believe it was on purpose. But I'm coming to terms with something that maybe wasn't a big deal was a bigger deal. It was so long ago my memory is kinda eh, and it could be a product of my OCD thoughts and anxiety, but yeah."

"Shame is a killer of the soul, and we have no choice what we are exposed to when we are young. You are becoming more aware as you grow, a wonderful gift of humanity, but a two-sided coin. 

The memory remains in your mind, the experience, in your nervous system (physiology). Look into emdr and brainspotting, both are powerful avenues to nervous system reprocessing. Hearing the little bit about your experience I think gives us both insight that your body is affected as well- intimacy is a core function that, yes, is very negatively impacted by pornography, exposure and access. 

I’m not sure of your gender, but 75% of the men I talk with, will share a troubling relationship or history with pornography. Many of the women, though social gender narratives drive other experiences that are more commonly seen in female gender. Either way, to say: You are not alone in this!

"From my POV, I see it as a malady of overcorrection. Naive people with good intentions see how the world is often uncaring and evil, so they have a well-meaning urge to fight back against that type of world. But because they're naive and unsophisticated, they think saying something like what you described will be enough to actually help people in some way. Except, it obviously doesn't, because it's not actually love. They haven't stopped to think long and hard about what love actually entails, and what sort of attention and friendship these lonely people actually need.

With all of that said, I don't really take much offense to that sort of thing. At the very least, it shows me that there are people out there with good intentions, who try to fight back against this cruel and uncaring world.

On the one hand, I agree with you and I do think a lot of people say I love you on the internet for clout.  On the other, I think we need more than one word for love in english.  It would be impossible for me to love you as a person, an individual, without knowing you.  I don't know you and you can't have a personal love like you describe without the knowing.  However I do love you as a conscious being.  I love you as another human who is sharing this planet with me.  I love you in the same way that I love all dogs.  In greek there are seven types of love and the one that's closest to what I mean is agape.  It means universal love.

Some of them mean well and would listen to you if you wanted to talk and would reach out if they knew you were struggling. Of course it’s impossible to know how everyone’s doing and on a platform it’s even harder. Then it’s more about sending love to people and just good wishes and intentions. There are different ways of loving someone and sometimes the only way to love strangers is by placing some words on a post. As someone who’s been on the receiving side of these posts during some dark times it did in fact make me cry and realize this poster probably just wants to help in a situation they can’t. It’s their way of trying to do something good and so it made me smile a little. Maybe I’m just an idiot and naive but I like to think a stranger can mean well and send you love through some words. And no they won’t show up and love you the way you want but those words were intended to brighten you dark mood, isn’t that love too?

Stress causes that real feeling of being hurt that sometimes I ignore possibility, that reason of my bad feeling can be not realated to trauma.

When you’re triggered it can also cause secondary traumas/ problems in your current life. It can tear apart relationships, cost you jobs, etc. all because of an involuntary reaction to a trigger. Learning to manage it is helpful, but not a cure all. That’s what annoys me with my therapists… they seem to think I should leave and have zero symptoms after a set timeframe, when in reality it’s been like reminding myself of it every week when I could be enjoying my good days.

"hey, I’m also an infant and child abuse survivor.

this is just my view, so if it doesn’t ring for you that’s ok, but i’ve been taught that ptsd isn’t made from trauma it’s made from the lack of support or care or reassurance of safety for the victim afterwards.

for me this meant that the reason the ptsd and flashbacks felt so bad was because of the shame attached to them. no one was there to show me or tell me that it wasn’t my fault and i was still loved. so my shame tells me i’m unlovable, and i’m bad/disgusting to the core.

I still have my memories pretty blocked, so especially because i can’t connect well with the actual traumatic incident, the mental and emotional pain and trauma from the neglect and further abuse feels so much more acute.
I think the rejection and neglect might actually just hurt worse as well though, because of what you internalize it saying about you.

Self talk that mimics what my moms words/actions told me are probably second to the most self hate inducing for me, and i think part of that is because she knew the abuse was happening, maybe couldn’t admit it to herself, and the was she mistreated and abused me definitley felt like it was a result of her own unresolved guilt and trauma.
she wasn’t even the abuser but the fact that she looked the other way taught me to think i wasn’t worth saving, the way she treated(a lot of blame was a big theme in her abuse) me taught me to think that the abuse would’ve been been my fault.

Based on other times i got abused but had support through it it makes sense to me that trauma was worse than abuse that cause it, i’ve been abused to reassured it’s not my fault and i don’t deserve it, the trauma tells me i deserve to be hurt."

"CW: mentions of child on child CSA
not sure how familiar people are but residential schools, but for families of survivors the people who actually went to residential school faired better than their families at home when they returned.
the kids who got abused were traumatized, and taught to become abusers(there are so many stories of incidents where school workers forced the children to abuse eachother).
when people came back to community and started abusing their family members, those people usually ended up a lot worse off PTSD wise.
getting abuse by a stranger it’s easier to think of them as a monster, to externalizer the abuse from yourself. but when it’s your caregivers or other family hurting you? it’s SO much harder to get past because the people who were supposed to love you hurt you, the people who were supposed to help take care of your after hurt you.

Hello everyone. I am 21 (M) and for some time I have been experiencing various symptoms indicative of PTSD however I doubt I have PTSD. I might get a diagnosis soon enough too to confirm but just thinking in general. I have had a relatively okay childhood until I turned around 8 years old where a lot of the shit started happening. I cannot share a lot but many bad things happened for like 6 years between 2008-2014 until the divorce finally happened. Although I wasn't personally abused or harmed, seeing my parents beating each other, screaming, shouting and getting beaten by family left me very depressed as a child. I also saw how our relatives who I thought highly of, left us in those tough times. While the trauma was severe, I as a child was less concerned and even didn't understand most of it. However, I have noticed these things have gotten severe since pandemic and I am almost always thinking about them to this day. Whether I rest, work or anything, I just get reminded of these things suddenly without thinking. I noticed gradual damage too. As someone who was very extroverted and outgoing, I got lot more introverted and now I avoid my relatives that remind me of those events, even though my parents moved on and interact with them nicely. I just feel stuck there, cannot forget what they did. I also experience like it's happening or I am being shouted at, but I doubt if it's really a flashback. Also now that I think, being shouted at makes me startled. I got into moments of such and I noticed I was breaking into tears, shaking or struggling to speak when someone shouted at me. I have also been having a lot of related dreams lately, where I see the events of divorce happening differently, or me being attached to one of my parents as such. Also, I notice the symptoms worsened as I got into friendships and especially relationships, as I was focusing on avoiding the mistakes my parents made and became too uncaring or self-absorbed as a result, which makes me feel more guilty and depressed and ultimately brings moments of guilt, shame and sadness from divorce and all the later events.

"Can witnessing a divorce cause PTSD? I would say probably not, maybe. 

**Can witnessing a parent get beaten and abused cause PTSD? absolutely.**

Have you looked up your ACEs score? Watching a parent endure abuse can absolutely cause trauma. I understand it happened within the context of the divorce, but I would suggest you reframe how you think about these events and even reframe how you talk about them (to yourself and to others).

Our narrative is a powerful tool and the narratives we choose can sometimes be unintentionally minimizing. It wouldn't surprise me if your family narrative was focusing own the divorce rather than the abuse as a way to minimize its potential impacts on you/make you feel like its ""no big deal""

I am still processing a lot of these emotions and behaviours as I always denied the possibility of traumatic memories and just called it my obsession with past that stopped me from moving forward however how all these things developed in a time span of just 1-2 months of vacation (after like 2 years of no break) have really made me look into things a bit deeper than just avoiding them and forcing myself to indulge in work.

"Waves of grief and relief are a healthy part of healing!

For example, I've been feeling pretty good the past couple of months, but a big reminder of my trauma placed me into grieving and sadness for the past couple of days. I'm glad to see that grief resolving this morning. Eventually I'll feel immense sadness again, but it passes, leaving me feeling ever so slightly more whole.

Two books/audiobooks that can help you through this (although not 'fix' everything):

The Body Keeps the Score: this is a more scientific analysis on what PTSD/cPTSD is and how it affects us.

The Tao of Fully Feeling: this is a more experiential book that provides guidance for emotional processing.

"ACES is something quick you can do online, its just a way to contextualize your childhood and kind of get an idea of what's normal vs. not normal.

The people we are competing with at school, at work, etc are running ""different software"" than us due to experiencing a completely different first 18 years of their life.

"In shadows deep, a tale unfolds,
Of innocence lost, a heartache untold,
I was just eight, a tender soul,
When darkness crept, taking its toll.

My mom's ex-lover, with evil guise,
Stole my youth, my bright blue skies,
Innocence shattered, trust betrayed,
A pain that lingers, never to fade.

In silence, I endured the fear,
No tender touch, no voice to hear,
My pleas unheard, my heart astray,
Lost in the night, where nightmares lay.

And in that darkness, I faced a truth,
A painful knowing, a bitter sooth,
My own dear mother, who should protect,
Turned a blind eye, the truth to deflect.

Her love for him, clouded her sight,
She chose to ignore my tearful plight,
Betrayed and broken, I felt alone,
Her love for me, it seemed, was gone.

Haunted by memories, scars deep inside,
The child I was, now masked and denied,
Struggling to heal, to find my way,
In a world where trust has gone astray.

But I won't be defined by this despair,
I'll rise above, with strength to bear,
I'll reclaim my voice, my innocence lost,
With courage and love, I'll pay the cost.

For I am not broken, I am still whole,
A survivor's spirit within my soul,
In the ashes of pain, I'll find my grace,
Embracing my truth, I'll reclaim my space."	BeneficialCause2927	post	17.87779104718163	male	White	0.004788313060998917	na	na	na	6	ptsd	failed

"After this whole thing, and that I calmed down. Now it’s igniting my other traumas and bad past events. I’m honestly feeling kinda lost and empty.

Edit: I am feeling better than before because I’m at home and not at the theatre which has the loud sounds. 


Context:

I remember being in the theatre, even though I’m legally an adult, the bright flashing lights and especially sound was too loud for me even if I wore sound canceling earbuds. It felt like it’s too much for me to handle. It was just too much. It triggered my past experiences and the movie felt like the embodiment of anxiety which I already severely suffer from. 

I watched it because of the hype and I didn’t have wifi at the time to look up more resources on whether I should watch it or not. 

We spent quite a lot on the movie tickets and I was too embarrassed to leave in the beginning, so I made myself sit there and endure this nightmare. This whole thing was just horrible. 

Now my dad is mad at me because we spent the money on the tickets, and I “wasted it”, I’m mostly angry at myself that I didn’t let myself leave the theatre when I was already incredibly stressed out. 

It’s honestly so stressful. I remember being on the taxi and spacing out."	Grateful_3138	post	9.757162302397274	female	White	0.999495267868042	na	na	na	3	ptsd	failed

My partner is dx.  We have a lot of issues in our relationship, he admits he has no tolerance for hard conversations, thinks I take advantage of him because I'm unable to work but I do 95% of the household management, only sees me negatively and others admit they see severe memory and emotional problems in him but won't discuss it with him, plus they aren't treated by him the way I am. It's been a long road of him getting worse and I feel like I'm about to snap...my mental health has declined so much, I feel worried and tiptoe around him constantly. He's tried 3 different meds, 2 made him worse and the last one I've never actually seen him take it but he claims he is. I'm afraid to ask him. 

I feel so abandoned and rejected because of a lot of factors (I'm not considered the primary alongside him for house ownership decisions, instead the renters (his dad and friend) seem to be asked for their opinions more or otherwise force them on us, he'd rather game or sit on his phone than spend any time with me, pulls me into fights then blames me for picking a fight and not immediately leaving him alone on request, then he blames me for not putting in any effort when he literally does not remember any of the times I do the things he's asked of me so there's no way to make him happy if he doesn't remember the truth,  he's going on 2 fishing charters this week with the friends that stood us up last night and even though I was going on the second one they booked someone else in my seat, he made a surprise trip to see my family for the weekend and then incessantly talked down to me about my ""complaining"" (where...) and berated me for being so selfish for hesitating to spend the last afternoon and night with his friends and not get to see my parents before we left.) He also knew his friends may cancel on us, and still repeatedly fell asleep until my mom woke him up again at the time he'd said he wanted to leave, then he was really pissed because we were 15 min late (which I made up for during the 7 hour drive, I checked on maps) and acted like we'd miss the event because of it. Meanwhile they'd told him before we left they were not keen on doing it anymore, but he decided to rush, guilt, and trick me out of time with my parents, and be pissed at me when he's the one who went back to sleep, for an event that he hadn't told me was canceled. 

 The joke is, he says I need to be grateful for staying an extra night. Ok...we stayed because HE got the dates wrong for both his friends events and double booked himself in two different cities, then acted like he did me a favor by rescheduling his other friends to stay another day with my family and called me selfish for not wanting to spend the entire ""extra day"" with his friends and not my family. Then last minute, at his friends house, he decided no he wanted to go ""home"" to my parents. He says he wants to and that he wants to be nice to me, he realized I care more about where we spend that night than he does (obviously, he spent most of the night with his friends sitting alone outside, taking a nap, or ignoring everyone on his phone). Now I bet he's pissed I didn't thank him for taking me home like I'd wanted, and in any case the friends he rescheduled cancelled / no showed us. 

The cherry on top is I had a really bad panic attack due to a ptsd trigger in the movie we watched with my parents that night. I ran outside to calm down, and my dad followed me, yelling that I need to get a grip, be quiet because of the neighbors, threatening that he'd walk away from me and leave me, and he even tried to grab me. I was backing away and begging him to stop, I was in the middle of my panic and triggered and he was being so aggressive and guilting me. I didn't run away, I just kept my distance. My dad finally stormed off and it took an hour and both my partner and my mom driving to look for him before he came home, then he ignored me entirely and went to bed. 

Here's what I did wrong: 

I had accidentally let the dog out when I ran, but I kept an eye on him and stayed near him.
I didn't say anything to anyone when I left, because I was sobbing hysterically and couldn't breathe let alone talk.
I ran away and left the house and went to the end of the driveway, and my dad's advancements pushed me further down the rural lane. 
I walked away from him later that night. I had apologized numerous times and asked him to not be mad, I'm sorry I ruined the night, I'm sorry I'm like this, and he said I don't take any accountability and that he needs to give me space because he makes it worse. I told him he doesn't, and that I'd leave him alone if he wants which he said he didn't want. So I explained (I have many times before in more depth) that when he leaves or ignores me when I'm upset (any degree of upset) it feels like abandonment to me, he helps me by being present. He snapped that its my problem and I need to take a deeper look inside myself then, and I was hurt and still very rattled from the panic that I just walked away to avoid a further fight. He claims he checked on me and offered me stuff numerous times, I don't remember that. I think he could've been more understanding while I'm feeling so awful and not been so accusatory and mean, rather help me when we're calm to come up with a plan that addresses my abandonment issues as well as his need for space that he won't admit since he claims it's for my good. After this, he went to sleep on the couch in the sitting room, so I went to sleep in the living room. 

The next day we drove 7 hours in almost total silence until he shared about how he can't trust me around kids, he thinks I'll freak out and leave them if they get hurt (a specific hurt is my trigger) he doesn't see how he can have kids with me or trust me alone with them, basically just ragging on me. He's right, they're valid concerns, but I'm feeling so frustrated and hurt its all about my mental instability and how I'll traumatize them, and nothing about how he understands I was triggered, that what my dad did wasn't okay, or any recognition that he has plenty of his own issues that are killing our relationship ( I'm in this group because he's the one with depression, anxiety, ptsd and adhd, I have no official diagnoses but match depression and ptsd, I also have an undx eating disorder). Other times he can't wait to have kids and he knows I'm going to be an amazing mother and he's the best he can imagine for a partner. While I understand his concern with the kids, I'm frustrated by the rest of his issues he listed above. It feels hypocritical of him, when he leaves the room/house regularly without details; walks out during discussions or fights, and doesn't take any accountability for himself or ever apologize but doesn't remember all the times I do that (he thinks he's the only one to apologize and I don't).

I've been in therapy for 3 years now, I have made incredible progress as a person and partner. He sees hardly any of it, meanwhile he's gotten unbearable to the point others comment he's really unstable and are super worried for his emotions and memory problems. I haven't been this triggered in months, and don't drink much anymore (I used to run when I was drunk and panicking, but I haven't in about a year). 

Anyways, it's sort of a rambled dump that takes an honest look at a situation where I was the problem, I really struggled. I'm still really struggling because of our relationship as a whole and I just needed to vent or get some advice maybe.

"I am sorry.
You are not alone.
I hope this finds you “recovered” from the exhaustion of those terrible and trying days.
Personally, I can understand many of these behaviors, problems, and negative patterns in a long term relationship.
I empathize with you as I am currently unable to seek employment due to medical issues.  
I feel abandoned often, alone, resented, isolated, and then sad and stressed about the situation.  
We are 29 yrs married and have been together for 35 years. I had children because family was more important to me than anything.  We are old enough that we did not over analyze having children; our mindset was always very traditional in that way.  We did not weigh out risks of genetics and mental illness.  We simply valued family. In spite of holding advanced degrees and the potential for a rewarding career, I “retired” early and stayed home when our first was born and went on to educate all of our children at home.  This was meaningful work and I do not regret the investment of my adult life. We are thankful to have children and they are grateful for their unconventional upbringing. Our children struggle with a variety of diagnoses and have not had it “easy.” Life is never perfect though, right?  Times can be rich and rewarding even when punctuated with serious obstacles and difficulties.
After spending decades doing unpaid work at home, I now find myself unable to go back into employment and we are struggling financially, amplifying my situation. It’s a very uncomfortable position in which to find myself now. I definitely feel undervalued and the relationship dynamic is skewed incorrectly. I am not sure that I have advice for you, but I can relate to these difficulties you are describing. Your need for gentle support and presence from those who love you/you love is valid. Not receiving that support is painful and reinforces your feelings of abandonment and isolation.  I quite easily find myself at the “end of my rope.” I am weary of apologizing and forever being seen as “the source of the problems” whatever they may be. I do not think it is right to be the only party who brings an apology.  I have sort of stopped offering them. Perhaps I have reached a place of resignation and have found it to be true that “If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em.”  This is a committed relationship and we have adult children and one still at home.  I have thought about the possible benefits of leaving and the potential risks of leaving.  For me, the benefits of keeping a family intact are many.  They are countless.
I am trying to be more empathetic to the needs of the other and to be content with whatever each day brings.  My perspective is softening and I am seeing him with kinder eyes.  There are still very difficult times and I cannot force someone to seek help…I may seem naïve or stupid to some but love is a choice and an action. Ours covers this multitude of trials.
Most importantly, I wanted to respond to you and let you know that I hear and see you.
I hope today this finds you having a better day.
My prayers for you are for healing and for faith.  May your partner be inclined to value you just as you are!  May your strengths be recognized and your weaknesses be supported in love.
May you find yourself supported by loving people in your midst and a sense of community that richly blesses you.
May angels surround you with protection and help and minister to you the healing upon their wings.
May God draw near to you and make His presence known.  You are never really alone.
I send off this comment with love and hope for you and your future.
Blessings. 🩵"	ivory_vine	reply	na	na	na	0.9993676543235779	strong	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
"Thank you so much for such a lovely message. The effort I see you've given me means the world. Thank you for all the kind words at the end, I need to put those in a daily affirmation for myself ! 

I agree love is a choice and action, and definitely stay and put up with things others do not understand. Quite honestly neither do I. But I do have faith a solution exists, not to make things perfect but to drastically improve them. I can see him spiraling and taking it out on me, and it's not fair but I agree, I am learning to try to see him through kinder eyes, almost pitiful eyes understanding the struggle he's in that he doesn't even seem to see. I just need him to find help, but I am helping myself and filling my cup the best I can. It's just the roller coaster of life I guess. 

Your family sounds wonderful, your contribution is immense and life changing for everyone in your family and I hope its recognized the older your children get. I'm so sorry you're struggling with employment now, remember all you have done for others and focus on yourself now, you deserve hobbies and cup filling activities that make you feel whole !"	ivory_vine	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9993676543235779	weak	no	no	na	ptsd	failed
"I hope you are having a good day!

May you have that discernement you need from day to day to make decisions that are best for you and your SO. 

Relationships are difficult!
Yet, we are meant to be in families.
It is so hard when we don’t have the “best” people with whom to work at making a beautiful family.

I don’t have any awesome answers, but sometimes God works in mysterious ways.  I do believe He leads us day by day and cares for us, loving us more than we can imagine.

May you feel that unconditional love and find that you have so much to share with everyone who crosses your path.

May you find yourself able to make the most of each day, regardless of what those around you are doing.

"Hey yall,

So i have PTSD from an event that happened when i was 10 or 11. I  understand how it has effected me in my day to day. Essentially to cope not only did I identify with the trauma and gave it a narrative, gave myself a reputation,  gave it power over me and in doing so began neglecting myself, needs, etc. I am 24 now and have done vigorous work to get to this point. I havent experienced a romantic relationship and i hold back and people please im your ordinary nice guy from this to keep me safe and i dont want to be anymore. 

I was curious if anyone has some self care tips, meditations they done or advice they can give so i can get over this hump thats been stuck with me for a long time. I understand its PTSD and permanent  but i know i can still live a fulfilling life with it. We are not our trauma.

"

In 2018, I had a hallucination (while I was awake), that two men were standing in front of me, and one of them picked up a gun and shot me between the eyes.  After this I began to dream quite regularly in my sleep that I was shot to death and I was always shot right between the eyes in the dreams. I never woke up after i got shot, i just kept dreaming and standing there watching my own body on the floor. It's said that it's not even possible to do that bc we dont know what happens after death. Every time I woke up, I felt disappointed that it was always a dream and began to form a strong death wish in my body.  I remember the feeling of letting go of all the sadness, hate and stress and just being free.

But last night something different happened.. I dreamed that a man was chasing me and he really refused to give up.  I tried to run and hide all the time and climbed onto a roof.
But the roof was built of joists with big gaps so the shooter saw me all the time and kept trying to shoot me  .  I woke up several times feeling sad, then went back to sleep and ended up in the same dream.  In the morning I woke up again from screaming in my sleep and crying and I have had severe anxiety since I got up.  And this was the first time I in the end managed to get away from the shooter. In my other dreams I didn't even try to run.

The truth is that I longed for a long time for something like this to happen for real, so I don't understand why I for once felt sad.  I wonder if it's just that I'm really ready, and that what happens to everyone around me after I die has started to catch up with me or if it's my subconscious screaming for help.

The rest of you with PTSD, do you usually have similar dreams?  If so, how do you deal with this feeling and longing?  I have always wanted to disappear for my own sake, but I know that if I do, there will be a whole series of other suicides after me.  Above all, my little sister and hence I can't.  I try to feel better and find hope but it always comes back to a point where everything feels pointless.

Could this be a typical PTSD thing? Cause when I have good days, I have REALLY good days and love myself and my life. And suddenly it comes back to this. 

And can PTSD ever go away 100%? I would love to get some advice from someone who has managed to overcome this illness if so."	_whatheactualfuckk	post	15.420320263777306	male	White	0.9967279434204102	na	na	na	7	ptsd	no prediction.

"Do you have a therapist? Suppressing things doesn't help at all. you're right. 
What I do or try to do, is acknowledge my feelings, allow myself to feel that way for a certain amount of time and then after that I kind of say to myself, okay anxiety (or whatever) thanks for coming and keeping me safe but now I need you to go. Then, i use whatever technique or activity to try and get myself out of that. 
It's about learning to sit with the discomfort but not letting it take over. And after time, being able to pull yourself out faster and faster.
It's hard, I'm still learning, but it's the panicking about panicking that pulls me into a downward spiral and I'm trying to stop doing that.

I had a situation before where I was harassed for a long period of time by someone I had met online, at first there was no issue with them but   Things spiraled and I no longer wanted to stay in contact but they kept coming back, kept trying to call me on no caller ID numbers, and much more. I just wanted to be left alone. One thing they would say to me or rather call me was pretty girl… now anytime I hear someone call me that I get so anxious I can hardly handle it..

"*trigger warning*: SA, physical, verbal and emotional abuse

the first time I was assaulted I was 14. I drank with some older boys from my high school in a park then walked home to change. They followed me inside, I went in my room. One of them started stealing stuff from my moms room, another stole from my sisters room. The other one followed me into my room, sat on my chest and put his d*ck in my face forcing it in my mouth then his friend came in and held my arms down and pulled my shirt up exposing me. Was making comments about my body and touching me while I was still restrained. The other one started going down on me and I absolutely just froze out of complete shock and lack of awareness from the alcohol.  I had to go to the same school with these people for years. Word got around about it but in the way it was told I was called a whore and a slut for the rest of high school. I would avoid the halls that their lockers were in, and if I walked past them they would shout names at me. I saw these people at a party years later and I apologized to them because I didn’t want them to think of me negatively. 

When I was 16 I began dating a man in his early 20s. He had severe mental health issues and I slowly began supporting him emotionally and financially. He told me he loved everything about me but my body. I developed an ED and then he told me I was too skinny. He would choke me and tell me he thought about not stopping. He’d put knives up to my throat and laugh. He wanted access to my phone and I wouldn’t give it to him so i hid it underneath me and sat on the floor. he dragged me across the bathroom floor by my hair and pulled at my arms so hard I bruised as I screamed that he was hurting me. Eventually I managed to run to his room and sobbed on the floor and he came in minutes later asking me what was wrong saying he blacked out. I came back the next day and his mom, who he lived with, asked me why I came back. He’d frequently slap me and call me names like stupid. If I did something he didn’t like he would make me repay with sexual favours. When I finally got the courage to leave him he held my bag with all my belongings in it hostage. I tried prying it from his hands. He told me I was hurting him. I threatened to take all his medication if he didn’t give me my bag back and he said good I’ll just call an ambulance. He ended up telling me to go tell his sleeping dying mom that I was leaving and never coming back. I did this and he whipped my bag at me full force. I ran out of his house barefoot in the snow with my hands over my ears scared that he was chasing me. I’m 24 now, and when he reaches out to me expressing remorse or asking for help with his mental health I answer. 

The last time I was sexually assaulted it was by a man I knew my whole life. I had my first kiss with him as a child, I lost my virginity to him when I was in high school. We were always friends, we got along so well and I truly felt like he cared about me. I had always had feelings for him and he would often tell me he loved me too. He’d be shitty to me sometimes too though. After we would hookup he would text me the next day asking for one of my hot skinny friends numbers which made me so fucking insecure or would just ghost me for months. He’d come in and out of my life repeating this cycle for years. I got in a relationship and we didn’t talk for a while. He reached out and we had a really good conversation. He has a full time job, makes great money, and sounded like he was really a changed person. At this point, I really missed my friend, and since I’d known him my whole life he felt like a safe space. After weeks of begging to see me, I let him pick me up to go watch a movie at his place and catch up. While we may have had a sexual relationship in the past, I truly thought his intentions were as pure as mine. We had a glass of wine and talked for a bit, it was nice at first. He started rubbing my feet while I was talking which took me by surprise but I let it go. He’d make flirty comments here and there that I would let go. He then became more aggressive, exposing himself to me and touching me inappropriately. I asked him to stop numerous times and he would but then he’d start again. I threatened to leave but my phone was dead and I was far from home. At one point he picked me up and threw me on the bed and began dry humping me and kissing me as I asked him a thousand times to stop and no. He’d start petting my hair and rubbing my face telling me to relax. I tried pushing him off me but he easily had 100lbs on me. At some point I just gave up because my efforts weren’t working. He jerked off on my fully clothed motionless body until he finished then he drove me home. The next day while I was at work he asked me to hook him up with one of my coworkers. I told him to choke and die then I blocked him. He came into my work that day and several times after that just to taunt me with his presence. I would shake and cry at the sound of his voice or his laugh, things that I used to love so much. Recently, while I as drunk I unblocked him to tell him how much I hated him and how badly he hurt me. He was so apologetic and told me how much he missed me and everything he loved about me and I’m disgusted by how much I enjoyed hearing these words. He keeps messaging me asking to see me and some stupid part of my brain wants to see him too. I want to hit him and tell him how terrible he was. But I also want to catch up on life and see my friend, someone who I’ve had in my life through every age and phase. 

I read recently that these feelings are a survival instinct. Our brains trick us into seeing the good in people because we must feel like we are loved and cared about in some capacity, despite how much they hurt us.  It would be too much to handle if we didn’t think this way. I have no one to talk to about these fucked up contradictory feelings. I am an educated woman. I have a smart and reasonable brain that knows better and sees these monsters for who they are. But I have a stupid heart that wants to forgive and believe that people can be good even if they do bad things."	deepfriedwriter	post	25.629967437297967	female	White	0.9931653141975403	na	na	na	3	ptsd	failed

But do those few good memories you have with him outweigh everything else that he has done to you?	deepfriedwriter	reply	na	na	na	0.9931653141975403	strong	no	no	na	ptsd	failed
Thank you so much for responding, I’ve really wanted to get that off my chest as I said I don’t have anyone to talk to about it. I know that these few good memories definitely do not make up for the ways he traumatized me. I just wish I could get my heart to understand this as well.	deepfriedwriter	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9931653141975403	strong	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

I feel like after finishing school theres a point where you feel stagnent. Theres like this long pause in my education that ive had after finishing high school. Seems like i dont know what to do i still dont have enough experience to make a choice on what i want to do or to move forward. I think both my parents stopped their education early and thats why they proabbly dont know anythibg beyond graduation. They disnt have enough experience to guide us into picking a carear. I feel they just dont know enough to help me pave the way for my life. And ik so disheartened cause i dont wanna not do much i wanna get somewhere but its hard. They dont seem to know anything i have to figire it out alone. I wanna be successful but im living with people who have a minset of getting through the daya nd surviving like i wanna thrive not barely be happy.

"yeah I know, you cant diagnose me an thats not the idea nor the question. just wonder how this plays back to the multitude of your individual experiences, I see quite a lot which could be PTSD in my case, but totally not rigid on it. because it is so heavy and all encompassing. also love to hear how y'all deal with it. <3  


there are quite a lot of symptoms, 

triggered by: betrayal trauma, bullying, harsh conflicts, grief

extreme rumination, but so much so that I AM in the past. couldn't I, shouldn't I, allll the time

which is really retraumatizing, its like digging up all my traumas with a blunt spade, then spitting on them, as opposed to, gently going towards them in a safe space like in great therapy and peeling

zoning out, burnout

it feels like time stood still since 8 months, (and I am still there)

wake up more tired than I go to sleep, 

feel like I looked into the face of death

anger, irritability, very low treshold for setbacks or irritation, very little patience

desperate need for ""rest"" but actually just pushing stuff away / repressing or even maladaptive daydreaming, ""pushing away myself""pretty much

started with fight or flight"	BothLeather6738	post	21.503573155985308	male	White	0.046449728310108185	na	na	na	1	ptsd	failed

"Hey so I have got C-PTSD, borderline and severe depression - especially the depression is linked to the C-PTSD and it's hard for me to trust people. If I find them then I can't keep the friendship going for various reasons. I have made the experience that when I open up to just TWO friends out of 7/10 then still one of them ghosts me. Most of the time I hide my suicidal tendencies from my friends and only talk to my therapist but in rare cases I feel the need to talk to a friend. Then I text a friend that suicidal thoughts burden me and they turn to ghosting me instead of telling me that they can't deal with it.
Today I talked to my therapist about it and she fully understands the way it hurts me. Do you get that too?"	Gullible-Tea1147	post	27.241505873682513	male	White	0.995044469833374	na	na	na	5	ptsd	failed

"I also have trust issues. There are things about myself and my experiences that I've never told anyone... And I don't know if I ever will.

Something people with trust issues often do when trying to break the cycle: we trust some people with information they shouldn't have. We're like ping-pong balls, flying from one end of the spectrum to the other, bouncing back and forth until we find ""our center."" How else are we supposed to figure it out? It's not like anyone taught us when we were children.

To be clear: I'm not defending the so-called friends who ghosted you. I'm not blaming you for their behavior either. You're brave to open up, and I'm sorry it didn't go well. Perhaps it boils down to: they don't possess the life experience necessary to properly empathize with you. They don't know how to handle it, so they do nothing at all.

What I had to learn was how to _build_ trust with people. You start small and watch how people react. Their reactions in the moment will tell you more about their character than any of their words. If they react well, you can trust them with something a bit bigger. Break it down into steps. Make it a gradual process. If you're ever not sure, just slow it down."

I'd like to give you positive advice but the way millennials ghost people is one of the proofs that the American experiment is a failure.

My daughter is right on the border of GenZ Zombies and Millennials and she tells me, the only way to deal with ghosting is to ghost them back and if they come back it is because they want something.

"Last year I was SA'd by my (formerly) best friend, and during that time I also found out my ex showed intimate videos of me at a party. I've had a really hard time trying to get over but slowly getting better.

I got back together with said ex and we've been together for 6 months now, I know it sounds naive and stupid, but he showed regret and understanding and did a lot to earn my forgiveness and trust. 

That was until some weeks ago, I impulsively went through his phone and found that he still kept nudes from his former hook ups. I was really hurt but didn't say anything to him until last night because I couldn't take it anymore.

He reacted badly, got very defensive and told me that ""he keeps them as trophies and as a reminder that when shit ends with me, he can go fuck any of those girls"". 

I got triggered really hard, I recall everything in a blur, he said he didn't wanna deal with me anymore and  tried to go upstairs, I leaped on him and started grapping him really hard while crying and screaming and telling him to please tell me he didn't mean that and please don't leave me alone and other ridiculous shit.

He pushed me off and called me a narcissist and that I have no empathy and only care about myself. I was bawling like a fucking baby and begging him to please hold me and shit.

At some point he said ""I told you the truth, it's your own fault if you're too weak to handle it"" and I just passed out...

When I came around I was laying on the floor, my sight was blurry, I couldn't move my body at all, couldn't speak, could barely move my eyes. He was just smoking a cigarrette and telling me to get up and to stop playing around. After some time he realized I wasn't playing, he picked me up and put me to bed, and started trying to get me to move. I don't know how much time went by but at some point he was crying and holding me and saying he was sorry he said all those mean things and to please wake up.

He tried putting some coke up my nose and that did the trick, I slowly started moving and my head hurt so much. We just held each other and cried all night.

It was horrible, for the life of me I couldn't move, I was so scared and that had never happened to me before. Right now I'm at work and can barely function, my thoughts are scattered and I'm shaky.

I really want to talk this out with my boyfriend when we get home but I feel so weak and stupid. I just wish he'd take care of me and say something to make me feel better, even if it was a lie. But if we talk and he says anything hurtful I don't know what will happen to me, I feel like I'm going to break into pieces. 

Has this happened to anyone else???? Any advice or kind words for me? :(

tl;dr: got triggered and got paralyzed"	VeganHyena	post	20.093315546143966	female	White	0.9969344139099121	na	na	na	1	ptsd	failed

" I’m so effing tired of the damn CPTSD, the freeze I feel on my chest and throat, how I still struggle to talk!

How I LOST my voice for the first year and a half after the abuse!

How my npd anti social personality disordered ex abused and traumatized me to the core and beyond, and she still thinks she’s the victim and did nothing!
Even with ALL the evidence!!!🤬🤬🤬
With all the texts her saying one thing, then another, she still denies it!

I’m no contact since years, but the trauma is still real and EATS me up every day! EVERY damn day!😢
I’m SO TIRED!

and let’s not even talk about the severe body dysmorphia that abuser caused me!

And YES I’ve worked with various therapists but I did not find much help! Narcissim is still a new thing to “professionals” here! 
I’ve actually learned and healed WAY more thanks to social media and internet and forums!
I DO NOT have trauma informed therapists here! They just wanna throw a bunch of meds at you and constantly interrupt while I barley can speak and I’m shivering with severe ptsd and they DON’T get it!🤬🤬🤬

I hate how I often I use food as a copying mechanism bc the ptsd gets SO BAD and I’m so alone!😭

My ex had TBIs and would tell me I have demons follow me around (not uncommon for narcissistis), I’d feel the most terrible evil presence while with her and it took me forever to understand it was her, and she told me it was me and I was the issue, typical narcissists!
She’d constantly black out and abuse me and then deny it and have seizures again and I’d double question myself as I felt I was a monster and had litrally no option as she’d dissalow me contact when she’d go to the ER bc I was “abusive”!

I was sleepless, broke and like a zombie! That evil creature was sucking every w bit of energy out of me!🤬🤬🤬


The trauma… oh the TRAUMA!!!!


I never got justice!

I just wanna live my damn life with out the constant ptsd chocking my throat!!! 

I’m really alone and just so effing tired of this all! Every day! EVERY DAMN DAY! The ptsd!🤬🤬🤬

I’m 31f and feel free to talk to me; but pls be aware I’m not looking for anyone to sell my anything or any BS, just genuine talking and being there for each other, struggling with ptsd!"	Chanel_My_Snowflake	post	25.929413682055674	female	White	0.9973946809768677	na	na	na	1	ptsd	failed

"Hi all,

My partner has ptsd that is triggered by yelling and just loud noises in general.  Yesterday, we got in an argument, and in an instinctual burst of anger to stand up for myself I yelled at her and threw a metal credit card on a table.  Of course, it freaked her out, she panicked, she started crying, and emotions escalated.  I feel awful because I knew that her ptsd gets triggered by yelling and noises, but I did not think in the moment and poorly reacted.  I am not normally an aggressive angry person, but some build up of emotions made me boil over.  That isn’t an excuse; I should not have reacted the way I reacted.  

Well here we are today, and I got her deep.  She seems uncomfortable around me and she says she can’t trust me.  She said it was so unlike me, but now that I have crossed the boundary, she can’t be around me.  She thinks there is no repair.  

I respect and understand everything she says; it makes sense given her condition.   I screwed up.  I really want to repair the relationship from the situation.  

 Does anyone have any advice?   What do you do when you or your partner trigger your/their condition and trust has been broken?  Any help appreciated, thank you."	fuckdood	post	23.18421473547161	male	White	0.9978637099266052	na	na	na	28	ptsd	failed
"This is a tough one because I get both sides. I have bad CPTSD, but my partner actually got diagnosed with PTSD because I went to my therapist and asked about getting my partner help. My partner was experiencing some of the symptoms I have, and he was already diagnosed with Autism and ADHD so the ptsd symptoms were completely overlooked. He gets triggered by yelling just like your partner does. I get triggered by yelling and aggression as well, but i have been through years of therapy. (13 years) 

Firstly, for me, though I make it a point to tell people about my triggers, I also don’t expect the people around me to be obligated to being a role model all the time. Everyone has off days. Some people do and will trigger me, and if they care about me, it won’t be intentional, and there would be clear remorse there on their side. 

My partner, when he is triggered by aggression, he freezes, or runs. He doesn’t yell. 

This is a two way street. You need to put in clear efforts to find effective coping mechanisms to outlet ALL aggressions, and she would have to be willing to accept that you may slip up from time to time. 

I’m not typically the type of person to ever say “break it off” so I’m not saying that, nor do i think that’s the best route here either. I think if you both are serious about putting in the work, this could be a very healthy relationship for both of you."	fuckdood	reply	na	na	na	0.9978637099266052	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
There’s likely room for repair but 1) she needs to be in therapy to treat her ptsd. 2) you should be in couples counseling with her to learn healthy ways of communication that don’t revolve around triggering each other. 3) you give her some space to get back to baseline which can sometimes take days for people with severe ptsd. 4) sincerely apologize and then step back and give her space. Don’t treat her like she’s damaged just be there to talk when she wants to.	fuckdood	reply	na	na	na	0.9978637099266052	weak	no	no	na	ptsd	failed
"As a married woman with PTSD directly tied to male violence, I think it’s important she works through her own triggers, so long as what you are saying is accurate and you have a healthy relationship overall. 

My husband loves me to death and is so healthy, gentle and kind; however, he will occasionally yell in arguments because that can happen when people are in an activated state. Does it make it right? No. But it happens. And even though my mind (before therapy) would try and convince me he was abusive, I knew it was relatively distorted and a fear based response. 

I don’t know if there’s more going on here and if this is just the final breaking point or if you truly feel blind sided and her reaction is based off of this one incident. 

Depending on how you answer, my feedback would be very different."	fuckdood	reply	na	na	na	0.9978637099266052	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

"Hei! I would have been on the side of your significant other too with a connection I have had recently. In my case he made it look like having red flags and insulted me and gaslighted me too which to me are not acceptable though it just happened twice but to me that was enough plus I didn't like the fact he couldn't understand I have PTSD and since he went with someone else when we still weren't official gave me even more traumas. But the difference with you is: I don't even know if he ever realized he brought things to a point of seemingly no repair or very difficult to repair. At least you do understand and know she has PTSD. Every time I told him, he always said nothing and probably didn't even understand what I was talking about. You must know that from my side, I see your girlfriend as probably thinking you're probably as bad as the other or others who did her wrong before of you and probably she thought why she didn't know beforehand? She is probably shocked and after what she has seen she thinks you're bad and she will never wanna be with you forever or for some very long time. But again this is my viewpoint, not sure if she thinks 100% like me in this situation. To be honest I don't think I told to the person I was talking with not to insult and gaslight, but I told him about my past and I said I was doing my best for the connection and that for me respect was very important altogether with other good principles. I don't even know if he ever apologized. I just kept being afraid he was like my abusive ex also because many times you only understand people are abusive after some time you are with them. If you really want to have a better life for you and for others, work on yourself. At least do it for yourself.

"A lot of people are saying it's normal to yell in arguments, but I don't think yelling should be an acceptable way to talk to your partner whether they have PTSD or not. Of course, scenarios differ, and there are extreme cases where one might lose control due to a brief and temporary lapse, but I don't think it should be ""normal"" baring that. I have PTSD, and that's a hard line for me personally. 

The thing about CPTSD from abusive relationships is that, often, one didn't/doesn't realize they're in an abusive situation until it's too late and the abuse becomes so extreme it can no longer be rationalized or ignored. As a survior, by the time one has language around CPTSD, they are likely to have learned about the structure of abusive relationships and be hypervigilant, not just in as far as triggers go physiologically, but also be intellectually aware of the early signs. That is to say, she may be suspicious that this is the start of a patern of abuse she's seen already before you. Little boundaries are usually crossed before bigger ones.

My partner and I have never raised our voices at each other in anger. If we're singing or joking, it's way different. Granted, we've only been together a little more than a year, and maybe there are challenges that haven't come up that could change our record. So far, though, we have had arguments and disagreements, but we both put in work to clearly communicate without hurting each other. 

I think this is because we each hate being yelled at and because we hate the idea of being the kind of person who yells at people in anger. Both feel so awfully iky in a way that clings. For me, that looks like practicing mindfulness. I do my best to feel my feelings as they arise and process what I want to communicate before assessing whether I'm able to communicate at a particular time or if I need some time to cool off. If I'm upset, I might say, ""I'm upset about x,"" or ""x hurt my feelings,"" while explaining my perception of the situation calmly and perhaps offering alternative solutions if relevant. I might still be a little emotional, I'm not a robot, but if I can't communicate in a way that is unnecessarily hurtful or intimidating, it's my job to know that (even if I only realize mid conversion), and say ""hey, I'm getting worked up, let's talk about this soon"" or ""I'm too upset to talk right now and I don't wanna be mean, I'm gonna go cool off for a bit"". If he expresses something along those lines, I do my best to be open to what he has to say and really listen, show grace, and give him the space he needs. 

It's important to always come back together and have the conversation and not just avoid it, though. It takes a lot of work, a lot of trust, a lot of patience and grace. All skills that we sometimes fail at in different measures. I think I've only been able to have some success here because of how many times I failed with other people and how lucky I am to have the chance to do my best regulating myself now with someone who puts in the same energy. 

As some here have suggested, I think that if you could sincerely apologize: own your behavior, offer what you will do instead next time you are upset and really dedicate yourself to that course of action-  after giving the space they need, you may have a chance of moving on with them. Either way, we can only start from where we are now, and it's never too late to work towards being the kind of person you truly want to be for yourself and those you love. I wish you both well."	fuckdood	reply	na	na	na	0.9978637099266052	no	no	no	na	ptsd	failed
Its hard to repair. If someone triggers me enough I begin to get the ick feeling every time they enter the same room as me. And now I am physically preparing myself to have to defend myself every time they are near. And this isn't a conscious choice. It's just how some of our bodies start to react.	fuckdood	reply	na	na	na	0.9978637099266052	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
Wait for her to cool down, then ask her if there's anything you can do to help her. You and her can also work together to make a safety plan for when she gets triggered. Also,. keep in mind that you can help her, but this isn't your battle. This is something she needs to work with overcoming. (Especially with the help of a therapist.) Best of luck.	fuckdood	reply	na	na	na	0.9978637099266052	weak	no	no	na	ptsd	failed
Offer to come up with a safety plan do she has a predictable expectation of what will happen if things get heated again.  It's not reasonable to think a person will never lose their temper, people are imperfect.  Include stuff like a cooling off space, a way for her to communicate that she's getting alarmed, a way for you to communicate that you're getting upset and want to take a break and get back to this later.  Consider holding hands or snuggling while discussing challenging topics, it makes it harder to be upset and easier to be considerate of the other person.  Ask her if there's words or actions you can take to reassure her when tense conversations happen.  In the moment, say out loud that you love each other and you both want everyone to be happy, you just need to find the right way forward, it's a good reminder.   And, try not to take her lack of trust personally,  it's really not about you.  It's like here, we had a bad and unexpected tornado a few years back, and now you can feel the tension in town when it rains or the wind picks up.  People aren't afraid of the rain, but they can't tell the difference between rain and the start of a tornado.	fuckdood	reply	na	na	na	0.9978637099266052	weak	no	no	na	ptsd	failed
There is couples counseling/therapy that is designed to help couples navigate the PTSD one or both of them have. My partner triggers me from time to time, it happens to the best of us, but the tools we learned in that therapy together are real life changers. I would suggest looking into something like that.	fuckdood	reply	na	na	na	0.9978637099266052	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
Honestly, she needs to continue to work through her trauma and her triggers. You’re a couple and couples fight. Sometimes, that includes yelling. It’s not perfect, but it is human. It’s a very general trigger to have. You did it in the heat of the moment, you have apologized, and you’re working on making amends. That’s great! Ask her if she needs anything from you and what you can do to help her feel safer. And beyond that, I do hope she’s going to therapy. Her triggers are her responsibility, too. Not just yours.	fuckdood	reply	na	na	na	0.9978637099266052	weak	no	no	na	ptsd	failed
"honestly, i dont think this one is on you. people with PTSD have the randomest triggers, for example, one of mine used to be when people would push down their cuticles. it's a habit people can't control, just like sometimes when an argument gets intense you can't control the fact you're raising your voice. it's our attempt to be heard by our partners when we don't feel listened to. people push down their cuticles when they're stressed or bored. these are natural reactions. 

while shouting isn't the ideal reaction in an argument, it's hard to control. if she feels triggered i would recommend keeping your distance for a little while, or until she's calmed down. if she's given any other advice about helping her when she's triggered, then follow it, unless she tells you to stop. just like you can't control your emotions when shouting, she can't control how her triggers make her feel. allow her some time and space, let her figure it out, don't force your perspective of what happened onto her. just let her cool down and occupy yourself with something else and try not to blame yourself too much. you know for next time to walk away when tensions run high."	fuckdood	reply	na	na	na	0.9978637099266052	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
"This is going to happen arguments happen between individuals and it’s normal she needs to understand that. She needs Therapy/Psychiatrist to work on her trauma. She can’t pin this all on you. People with PTSD or CPTSD need to time process and think about situations because we pick the most irrational thinking and become a shell so we can protect ourselves and to avoid the situation at all costs. Just give her time but don’t let her step all over you also. I don’t know her personally just like anyone else on here only You do. 

But at another standpoint be careful with some people they will try and use there mental illnesses as a excuse to act like they are valid if they have time to think on the situation afterwards and still think they didn’t do anything wrong. That is extremely a red flag. And you should immediately leave. 

I have CPTSD Me personally in my own situations everyone is different but this worked for me. I have huge problem like her of becoming a shell and not trusting anyone if I feel I’m gonna care about someone, if someone does me wrong or triggers me on accident it’s a bad way to think it’s a defense mechanism, but it takes time to get better on that with help and help works I am becoming more open to friendships again. No one has ever done this to me besides one girl and I’m still currently talking to her because of it. She called me out when I was on my bullshit(self sabotaging) NOT aggressively NOR passively just up front and blunt. And it felt really good to be called out when I was doing something that was wrong in the moment. Give her time like I said just to process it let us know what she says. Because this could go multiple ways depending on the end result. We can be unpredictable sometimes to people that don’t understand PTSD or CPTSD also everyone is different."	fuckdood	reply	na	na	na	0.9978637099266052	weak	no	no	na	ptsd	failed
"I might be able to offer some perspective. You don’t mention what gave your partner PTSD, but if it was from DV or an abusive relationship, this might help:

When I’m triggered (by yelling, vague answers to direct questions, or inconsistencies in someone’s behavior), I can go for hours to days fully believing that I absolutely cannot trust this person ever again. This is based in past experiences where I ignored red flags in a partner and stuck around to find out that I was in danger. Sometimes, especially in the event that someone yelled at me, I was right. Other times, I was just triggered, but still picking up on something that I knew I needed to pay attention to. 

Your partner might go for a few days feeling as though she can’t trust you, and yeah—she might not be able to, if yelling is something that you’re capable of doing to a partner. I disagree that yelling is normal in a relationship; I’ve been in many, and the only times I was yelled at were with abusive partners. So, if it were to happen again, I would have no reason to believe that this person would be different. 

If you want to regain her trust, you should probably give her space and let her work through it on her own. You can stay present for her and be calm and consistent, but ultimately there isn’t anything you can do while she is still triggered. Again, this is all coming from personal experience, so it may not apply. But this is what has worked for me in the past. 

I should also add that, for me, a partner who tries to violate my space when I’m triggered, or convince me I’m overreacting, wrong, or misunderstanding the situation will only make it worse. If she comes back willing to work on it, cool. Maybe it’s possible. But if not, you have to respect her decision and understand that your behavior is not safe for her, and you can’t have a relationship without safety and trust."	fuckdood	reply	na	na	na	0.9978637099266052	no	no	strong	na	ptsd	failed

"I can speak to my own experience with very similar situations. I have PTSD (really C-PTSD) from multiple instances of male violence and yelling in multiple relationships. Also childhood trauma but that’s a separate issue not relevant here. I’ve found it difficult to sustain romantic relationships, not only because I have a pattern of not seeing red flags and falling for people during the love-bombing phase, but also because I panic. 

For me being yelled at is a firm boundary I have to set in relationships and it’s not an unreasonable one (despite what my ex said).  If I’m yelled at I will have varying reactions from shutting down and dissociating to having a full-on panic attack with uncontrollable crying and hyperventilating and it takes me days to get back to baseline. So through therapy I realized I simply cannot be in a relationship with someone who will yell at me when they are upset. Which is why all of my recent (30s) relationships have ended because people tend to yell. I didn’t even know it was an option to set that boundary until I was already married the first time and experiencing panic attacks. 

It’s going to be difficult to repair now that you’ve crossed that line but it’s possible if she is willing to try. What I would want if it were me is for my partner to sit me down when I’m calm and sincerely apologize, let me know it will never happen again, and let me know how they are going to make sure it never happens again. They are going to get therapy to learn how to deal with their emotions, they are willing to go to couples therapy to learn how to better communicate, would be two great things. 

I recently had a similar thing happen with my husband (I’m married a second time now).  I was somehow able to get out “I don’t like how your talking to me” before shutting down but then he caught himself and backed off.  For several days I was in a dissociative state with mild panic, believing that our relationship may be over. But I forced myself to sit down and talk to him before he left on a trip this week because I know logically that he is an emotionally intelligent person and he won’t yell at me for bringing up things I want to talk about. It was difficult to do, I was near panicking the whole time even though he was being calm and supportive the whole time. So I talked to him and let him know (again) that the yelling can’t happen, that I’ve been shut down, and we talked about a few other things that I’ve been holding in out of fear.  Issues with the dogs, etc. I also found us a couples therapist who takes our insurance and has available appointments and he agreed to go so we can learn how to communicate better. 

It’s hard for me to trust men but I’m trying and working at it. I do have a couple of good male friends from law school/work and they help me remember that not all men are violent. I usually surround myself with women (pick jobs with female supervisors, use female doctors, etc) but unfortunately I’m heterosexual as far as I know so I keep trying to be in relationships with men. I honestly even considered trying to date in the deaf community because I figured there would be no yelling and I’d be down for learning ASL. But I met my husband and he is very emotionally intelligent and goes to and believes in therapy, so we do have a fighting chance at this. What concerns me is his reactiveness but he is actively working on it so I’m willing to work on the relationship too."	fuckdood	reply	na	na	na	0.9978637099266052	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
"I second all of this.  If she does get to a place where she can work on your relationship (She may not, because she may not be in a place where she can handle any relationship with conflict, which is all of them, right now.), my therapist had me do an episode for my mother, which helped us a lot.  I have bipolar disorder, CPTSD, and generalized anxiety; and we were given a stack of index cards and told that we would give them to someone close to us in our lives.  On one side of the card, we would write something like, ""When I feel..."" and the other side would say, ""Do this...."" and/or ""Do not do this...."".  For example, it would say, (Front) ""When I seem to be overreacting to a small thing, like someone yelling at me...""/ (Back) ""Do not tell me that I am overreacting and tell me what I have done wrong.  Do let me retreat to a safe space, until I calm down.  When I am calm, do ask if we can talk about what happened in a calm and understanding way."".    


It gives you a guide, so you are not only better prepared but also know more what to do when symptoms of her mental health challenges show up.  Even if we were in the middle of a fight, she would sometimes pull out the cards and look at them, and it made me know that she was trying to understand what was happening to me and handle it in a respectful way that would de-escalate it.    


At the same time, you have the same rights and can ask the same of her, and it could be helpful.  Make cards like, (Front) ""If I am acting loudly or aggressively  in a way that is frightening to you...""/ (Back) ""Do not shut me out and break up our relationship.  Retreat to a place you feel safe, give yourself time, and then allow me to talk to you in a calm and understanding way.  Remember that what you are feeling is not always about what is happening now but about the trauma you are still feeling, I love you, and I only want to build a healthier and happier relationship with you together.""."	fuckdood	reply	na	na	na	0.9978637099266052	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

"Not from me, I wouldn't call it a red flag. It's not okay to yell, sure, but who on earth has not raised their voice once in their entire life? I have the most understanding husband imaginable, but of course he sometimes triggers me during a fight. Not on purpose though, and he apologizes. If I'm scared of him because I'm having a flashback, it doesn't necessarily mean that his behaviour is toxic. 

If yelling is your go to reaction when frustrated, that's toxic. If you do it on purpose to trigger her ptsd, then that's definitely very toxic. If you once in a blue moon get upset and lose control of the volume of your voice, that does not make a red flag."	fuckdood	reply	na	na	na	0.9978637099266052	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

I'm 19 and diagnosed with PTSD, my dad is aware of my diagnosis and has had conversations with me and my psychiatrist about what it means but it has been a few years since then. I've had a few episodes where I dissociate and have a flashback in front of him but my last one has not been for some time. Last night I had a particularly bad episode and my dad is telling me that I am faking it and I need to get out of the house by tomorrow because of it. For context I wasn't a danger to anyone around me nor was I moving around or anything, I shouted a few times and repeated some phrases but I'm not entirely sure what particularly caused him to say these things. 
Like I said I'm 19 so I'm going to move out within the next few months but I'm just not prepared at the moment and I just would really appreciate some advice as to how to talk to him about it and explain what happened wasn't me faking in a way to get him to understand.

"I remember feeling anxious and desperate from a really young age. I started self-harming when I was 6 yo, by biting my fingers till I bled, something my parents dismissed.

I changed to knifes and other sharp things at 13/ 14, and I always had this sensation something horrible happened that I can't remember. I still have that anxiety and sense of danger everywhere I go, and I can't let go of it.

On top of this, I had sexual behavior and sexual fantasies from a really young age too, I remember masturbating at 6 and *knowing* what I was doing, but at the same time now I'm deeply terrified of sex. I remember ""punishing"" my toys by burning their butts/ bottom parts. And other disturbing sexual behaviors I'm not going to get into, because I feel repulsed by it. Again, all this between 6-12 years of age.

But the only thing I can remember sexual-related and that caused me negative feelings, is my parents trying to put their fingers with oil in my butt forcefully, because I was constipated. I remember that as a trauma and I remember feeling violated too, but is that enough...?

Other thing I can't stop thinking about, is one teacher in primary school, that touched me in a really weird way and was fired the second year of teaching because of some rumors. He taught maths, and I remember asking something after class, and him touching my back and waist while explaining something. He touched my hair sometimes too, again with really weird vive.

i can offer another perspective though. i had this strange, strong gut feeling when i was 18 that i had PTSD and i had absolutely no memory of a single terribly traumatic event happening to me. i had all of the symptoms of someone with PTSD. i realized through therapy that my entire childhood was traumatic. alcoholism and addiction runs rampant in my family and i suffered a lot of emotional abuse and emotional neglect."	perra_sanchez	reply	na	na	na	0.7018154859542847	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

Afraid of public bathrooms (still have shy bladder to this day).  migraine headaches, teeth grinding, panic attacks, afraid to speak unless spoken to, stuttering, etc.  Anhedonia, avoidance and sexual anorexia as an adult.  severe autoimmune disorders.

"Yup. Well, in addition to the littany of horrible shit that I retained mostly continuous knowledge or at least vague awareness of. But yeah I didn't recall any CSA related stuff till a couple years ago (mid twenties). Like you I kinda had lots of hints leading up to that but I always wrote them off or explained them away as something else. The specific flashback that brought that stuff up in full force I was fortunate was flushed out enough to give me not only a clear who what when where, but also a couple very vivid sensations that would have been nearly impossible for my brain to invent but very readily explained as corroboration of what I remembered. And a few Google searches revealed that the person I believed had done it was, in fact, a convicted serial child predator. (Who got five years probation and no jail time, the evil fuck, but I digress)

The other experience I believe I've had with CSA my memories are so fractured and hard to remember it's very hard to hang onto them or say what exactly happened. Let alone when it started or stopped tho I have a loose time range. It's like I'll remember pieces of things while I'm actively triggered or just calming down from a flashback or something, but after the fact I may make some vague awareness of that thing if I really focus on it, but it's hard to hang onto the memory. Like staring at the sun, closing your eyes, and trying to recall what color it was, ""it might have been yellow but all I see thinking back on it is pink and blue spots, maybe I just imagined it was yellow.""

">I had sexual behavior and sexual fantasies from a really young age too

>I remember ""punishing"" my toys by burning their butts/ bottom parts. And other disturbing sexual behaviors I'm not going to get into, because I feel repulsed by it.

I had this experience from the age of 4 on, especially ""punishing"" toys or wanting to punish storybook characters in a similar way. It came with this overwhelming anger, shame, disgust, and sadness. I was hypersexual and the sexual component was sadomasochistic in nature, I wanted to punish myself a lot. 

I feel repulsed by it too but the fact is that we were children. Children do not do/think/feel things like this on our own with no influence behind it, and how could we have processed what we were feeling/going through, not only without help but without acknowledgement? That is a lot to ask of from a child and unfair. 

I have fragmented memories that completely haunt me. I also have clearer memories of horrible things that feel too distant to recall even though I am aware of them so they come and go from my mind randomly.

Most of all I have red flags that paint a pretty clear picture. I may not know what exactly happened or who was in on it but I know *something* happened. 

You are not crazy or alone. 

>I remember that as a trauma and I remember feeling violated too, but is that enough...?

If you felt violated, than yes, 100% that is enough. Trust the things you feel, you feel them for a reason. You are the one who decides that you felt violated, how you feel about it is valid. 

Again trust your instincts, if it doesn't feel like that's the source of all of this then it may not be. 

Journal your thoughts so you can reference them as time goes on, it will give you valuable outlet/insight into the past that can be very validating and useful in the future. Keep it safe from others and if it is not safe to do, don't do it or find a way to make it safe. 

Don't torture yourself trying to remember either. I definitely did this to myself and it didn't do me any good. If this happened early in your life your brain may have experienced a trauma it was not developmentally capable of processing. There are so many factors that shape the way you do or don't remember.

Some people have memories that come back when they start doing much better or begin to feel safer in ways. It's like the brain senses all the ""freed up"" space where all this stress and turmoil used to be and decides you now have the capacity to handle the memories. Then it will drip feed you these memories because they need to be processed properly. 

Some people are triggered by random things or people or sensations. 

One person described not being able to find a strange childhood TV show that was excessively violent and inappropriate. One day they reconnected with a sibling who explained that there was no TV show. The abusive parent would abuse the child, then go sit in the Living room like nothing happened and when the beaten child came in and asked why, the abuser would play stupid and say that they must have seen it on TV. So the child remembered it a way that painted the safer picture. Believing that lie kept that kid safe when they were not. 

Others just don't remember. 

You don't need to remember it to heal it. You just need to take good care of yourself, trust yourself, and not beat yourself up for what you went through as a child or what you are going through right now."	perra_sanchez	reply	na	na	na	0.7018154859542847	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
"Yes, and I've been trying to dig and get a better understanding of this kind of thoughts. Sometimes it's like my mind is trying to rebuild a lost scenario. I understand it's very distressing and it's hard to not focus on that feeling, as it may be triggering in a desperate way. I got an advice that may be helpful:

memories are very tied to emotions, and you may not remenber what exactly happened for you to feel that emotion. Accept the emotion you've felt, its real and you should not feel guilty about this emotions. Also understand that there Isnt much difference between a thing you imagined and memory, and if you're not sure about an event it may get confusing and hazy, but the emotion still remains the same and should be adressed with kindness and love."	perra_sanchez	reply	na	na	na	0.7018154859542847	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

"Yeah that's something I suffered too throughout my childhood. My mom is an alcoholic, and I remember throwing tantrums to keep her from drinking, and her getting really angry with me for doing it. I remember her grabbing me and putting me under the cold shower with only my underwear to ""calm me down"".

I remember a lot of verbal fights my parents went through at night. I remember crying before falling asleep, because my dad was insulting my mom because she was drunk.

My dad was really manipulative and snapped out really easily for no reason sometimes. Saw him hitting and kicking my cats from time to time.

My mom is really obsessive and... well. When I was sad/ upset, she ignored me or got angry with me, screamed at me, etc. It was random tho, and sometimes she would be the sweetest and most understanding mom.

Worst thing, is that my parents will never admit it. They'll never admit that those things happened, that I was there and I suffered all of them. I know they see me as a dog or a cat, that they have to maintain but doesn't have it's own conciousness and experiences. 

They help me financially now and I'm thankful for that, but I can't really feel a thing for them. I only feel guilty for using their money, and sad because they lived fucked up shit as well, but I can't remember feeling an ounce of love from them. 

My mom tried to be ""affectionate"" but it only turned out to be her forcefully grabbing me and hugging me when I didn't want to every now and then, after making my life a living hell the previous hour.

But still, I don't know if that's enough to make me so fucked, it's like I still have the feeling there has to be something else.

And I have the hope that, maybe something happened to me outside the house and it was me the one who behaved weirdly and aggressively so it was actually my fault. Maybe they were just trying to handle a traumatized child, and didn't know what to do, so they were desperate and irritable.

Because I see photos of myself, when I was 3/ 4 yo and I seem happy. I look like a normal child, I hugged my mom, did weird faces, smiled a lot. I really don't understand what happened."	perra_sanchez	follow-up	na	na	na	0.7018154859542847	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
"God, I'm really sorry.

It was similar for me, I guess. But with the photos, I directly asked my parents to not take them, or got mad when they did. So I don't have practically any photos from 6 to now. And I still hate seeing myself in photos.

Everything you said is something I have experienced to some extent. The fear of being touched, migraines, I even had several contractures on my shoulders and neck as a teen, because of muscular tension.

I really struggled with being touched and I looked it up a couple of times, why did I react like that. Sometimes I get touched and I let the person touch me (on the shoulder, hand, normal touching) but I feel this terrible feeling of anxiety and I freeze for a moment. I've been working on it, so a couple of days ago I went to a physiotherapist (I would never have consider it a couple of years ago). I was absent all the time. Now I can't even remember her touching me at all, and the next hours after the visit I felt like shit. I've been all weekend spiraling on self harm thoughts and anxiety and I started to obsess again about everything.

"you say you don’t know if this is enough to make you so fucked, but are you considering that through the eyes of your adult self or your child self? experiencing these things as an adult would have been upsetting surely, but maybe not as traumatic as it was for innocent tiny you. being so young and feeling those emotions and stressors is incredibly hard on our bodies and brains. 

my dad never hit me, and for the longest time i told myself that because he didn’t get physical i didn’t experience trauma and abuse. but having him ignore me while he drank himself to sleep, or carelessly having loud sex when i was in the next room, or kicking me out of his house when he got belligerent was enough to make a mark. especially because i was so young and so confused. 

if you feel that you may have some sexual trauma and no event that you know took place, repressed memories aside, maybe you saw some things you shouldn’t have? i have a weird relationship with sex and i’m very sensitive to hearing others talk about their sex lives, i don’t even watch porn because it makes me so uncomfortable (among other reasons). i also started taking an interest in it earlier than the rest of my girl friends and i knew things they didn’t know. i’ve started to dig into this recently and i strongly believe it’s because of what i mentioned above. when i was around 8-10, my dad would get drunk and start getting intimate with whoever he was dating at the time while i was at his house. wouldn’t even be asleep yet, just in the living room watching tv. i walked in so many times not realizing what was going on and it truly scarred me."	perra_sanchez	reply	na	na	na	0.7018154859542847	no	no	strong	na	ptsd	failed

"My wife has what I’d say is pretty extreme PTSD from a sexual assault a couple years before we met. Her episodes last 3 days usually but they’ve lasted a month in the past. She stays up for 2 or 3 days straight and sits inn the porch chain smoking cigarettes, joints and popping adderal. I think she is responsible with the adderal as she has a surplus at the end of the month but I only say it because of the staying awake I have no problem with her use of anything she wants to. Obviously she is avoiding night terrors so my 10 year old and I do our best not to take this too personally because she is so smart and caring in all other ways, just a little neglectful. I am grateful for that even because I understand that is because she’s feeling triggered but a little disappointing for our son. I have to take care of literally everything around here and she makes a lot of promises she can’t deliver on that I end up covering for.
However, this was not her behavior for the first 5 years of our relationship. She told me about it but it didn’t happen once. She got burnt out from hustling every day to save my life from a brain malformation and took care of me through gran mal seizures every day. I’ve recently become more stable in that area and it is her turn to be taken care of. How do I do this? She seems scared of me, says mean things, or gets physical to scare me away. But I’m not going to abandon her when she needs me the most, I just need to know from someone with PTSD what actually helps them out of an episode or if I just let it play out and don’t take it personally. She doesn’t remember much after as she is dissociative. Any advice would help greatly. Thank you and I hope this didn’t trigger anyone.

"My friend, I quite understand. PTSD diagnosis at age 10 and now CPTSD diagnosis myself. When you talk to her, Acknowledge your presence always as those with trauma sometimes cannot distinguish even the closest loved ones as safe until they are heard, seen, felt and recognized. 

Two: Be soft in voice, in cadence whenever possible, be of self control and if she is dissociative, make sure she is safe from self harm or accidental harm as well as yourself and your son. I have been known to react with my military and martial arts training when I am dissociating and having flashbacks, thank God I have not hurt anyone. Your son, I can offer you more as I was church youth leader and minister for close to 15 years. If your son is of maturity and is reasonable, have a serious sit down with him, explain about fears from hurtful traumatic situations and get yourselves some counseling. Get your wife if she is willing a trauma informed therapist. Resources below. Please be patient, but be safe, assess the tonality of her voice, is it growing in aggression, is she more physically volatile or emotionally. Any prescribed drug misused or overused will cause serious health complications down the road, Most common is liver or kidney shock or damage as they can only clean out so much (Medically trained for 17 years by my mother, A former E.R. Physician who died of a ten year pain medication addiction (Demerol, Oxycodone, Oxycontin and Methadone) herself 13 years ago). Please get her help as I do not wish for regret to set in if something were to happen much less for anything to happen to her as I have also counseled and comforted families who have lost loved ones to such misuse and addiction. Trust me, it is an unbearable burden as I live with such with my own mother's death to this day. 

Finally: Remove any regrets, any resenments that you can, love her even more, forgive her, when she is ready, hold her and cry with her as pain and suffering can never be numbed out for too long or avoided, she will break down hard. Then seek help in giving her tough love as she is headed down a destructive path guaranteed. Also, take your son out of the house if she is volatile or is dissociating. Your son does not need to see such of his mother if he is young or of teenage status as it is another burden that you will carry and she will eventually regardless. I took my little sister to friends houses everytime my mother got high. My sister (Special Needs) knows nothing of her addiction to this day as I swore everyone to secrecy and I will take it to my grave as well. Be kind to yourself as you are persevering in a task that makes the strongest of men quiver in fear as I have seen. Be of good courage and know when to get help immediately.

"Damn. I understand a LOT better why she just wants to be alone all of the time. There is stability in being alone. That’s really valuable to me. Thank you.

Oh and she rocks the crosswords like there’s no tomorrow haha. She’s got a whole porch setup. Physics videos on mute with music going and crosswords 24/7.

Unfortunately, in these past 5 years I have threatened to break up with her maybe 2 times after days of being screamed at and couldn’t take it anymore, I’ve yelled back many times that she’s lost it and being an a-hole. After a day it gets so hard to remain steady but I’m learning to. There is, or rather was until maybe a year ago, a lot of making up after episodes because I felt she owed me an apology for the terrible things she’d yell at me in front of our son. At this point we’ve learned enough together to know that’s kinda like her guilting me for having a seizure. Now I try to reassure her that everything is totally fine and we just want her to know she’s safe. The switch to kindness seems to have cut the number of episodes down significantly. I wish I could redo the past and I’ve made a bunch of mistakes for sure along the way out of ignorance or being self-involved. 
All that being said: if you were her would I now be a trigger? 

I’m really sorry you deal with this. I watch every day how hard and isolating it is. It’s sick to be abandoned like that by the people you trust. I hope you are doing alright tonight and really, reading this will make things easier tomorrow. Thank you."

This one sounds like an easy one and it is you who needs to learn to deal with it on your own, not her. It sounds like you are overreacting to her dissociating.  I live in the exact same environment, except my wife had to quit the self medication, alcohol was hers.  But she still dissociates, gone off the Earth entirely, but body is still here taking in input and able to physically notice everything. Makes little sense to me but I noticed it was my not understanding what was happening and my overreacting that was causing the problems for me. I learned to just let her zone out and when she comes back and acts like everything is okay and she never did anything strange I have learned to play along to get along.  PTSD is tough. I wish you the best. Go for a walk or a motorcycle ride. I am trying to buy one to do just that when she is gone on her trips to space for 3 days.

"I have severe CPTSD. Everything that you describe is similar to how I am, however i did get su!€!dal and i quit smoking thinking it would k!ll me(i have military related physical issues and am also a female) and i don’t take adderal. I however do stay up for nights in a row, completely sober, from stress. I get bored with staring at the ceiling and sometimes I’ll read Reddit just to pass the time sometimes. In an attempt to help you possibly understand what could be going on here, I’ll explain why i get cold, distant, etc to a caring partner. 

I have a fear of the unknown. Usually, when something was unknown in the past, it’s turned out to be the worst case scenario. Though my traumas are military related, they bleed heavily into my relationships because while I was being traumatized EVERYONE turned their back on me. In the military you are supposed to trust that your coworkers have your back… I couldn’t. 

So, I push people away when a person has done something that caused me to feel unstable. If someone isn’t by my side, well I know how that is. There is stability in being alone, even though it’s unbearably boring and I am 100% isolated. When you add another person in the mix, that adds a bit of unknown to the mix. 

This fear that i have, can also cause people to be controlling. 

If she’s like I am, the BEST way to help her that I can think of, is to be very careful to not do anything that will reasonably make her feel unstable with you. Some things that can cause a feeling of instability are lieing, cheating, generally mysterious or surprise like behavior, frequent breakups and makeups, threats to break off the relationship, verbally demeaning or demoralizing behavior, or even making a spectacle of how different her behavior is when compared to others. 

The intentional adderall use I wouldn’t recommend, though i can understand that she’s trying to escape from night terrors… I had to let myself experience them. This is important to discuss with a therapist, and terrors if you can remember them(sometimes i can) can aid in healing by helping teach yourself what your triggers are. The full on avoidance is not good with ptsd but distractions are good. There’s a big difference. 

Instead of chain smoking, like i also used to do(2 packs a night) I started playing simple repetitive games that stimulate my mind and have no aspects of violence or horror in them at all. I’m talking Memory games or word play games like wordle. Sometimes she will zone out. That’s unfortunate, and hopefully will get better. If you just do small tasks around the house that’s fine, and whenever she does anything, positive reinforcement is key. A simple “hey I noticed that you haven’t slept a lot, so i know you must be exhausted. Still, you did the dishes and i can’t express how much that means to me” can go a long way here.

Wow. I can’t tell you how incredibly helpful that is. I have been lost for a long time as to what to do and scared to tell anyone about it outside of our closest few friends, who obviously could tell anyway, and once I did she cut communication with them and has accused me of gaslighting her ever since but that will get worked out in couples therapy I hope. I made an appointment for this week with someone who specializes in PTSD. She is also petrified of doctors and hospitals as she’s been institutionalized once before. The hardest part is indeed what my son has seen, which isn’t drug abuse but is her night terrors and screaming mostly. We all talk very openly about it afterwards at least and that seems to help him a lot. I’ve never felt permission to get him out of there to a family member or friends house but now that someone who deals with it to has told me this is ok the next time she is dissociative I will do that.

I am definitely overreacting to her dissociating. I'm just unsure of what to do when she becomes aggressive. It's also unclear to me when the starting point is...I always realize later because she says cruel things that she wouldn't ordinarily say but in the moment it seems like she is just losing it for a second. Advice and support like yours is the reason I posted this. She came out of it today and I made sure to let her know there is nothing to be sorry about or feel bad for.

"Nah, I ask because my ex was taking Adderall and it turns out his script wasn't from a doctor. One of the side effects is psychosis, so it's important for her to discuss anything odd she may experience with that doctor.

For example, if she is hallucinating or delusional, her doctor needs to know.

Absolutely. It's a touchy subject around here because she feels I'm gas-lighting her when I bring up anything like this. I've said exactly what you are saying for years until realizing suggesting it was a trigger. I totally get that. And I take it for my own ADHD so I know how much it sucks when I miss a dose or go off it for a few years because I definitely need it. After being awake for a few days, she crashes out for a day or two and doesn't take it. She'll have night terrors in those times. She was drugged so it's impossible to get her to take anything at all outside of an acid reducer and Zoloft when she's absolutely sure it's safe. I'm sure I could talk to her while she is up and about now that it's been long enough and I've been better at dealing with her PTSD after folks suggestions and tips on here such as this one, but I'm also always hesitant to give it to her in those times anyway for fear it would keep her from getting any rest at all. I do know she's never abused it as long as I've known her because she takes the instant release as needed and has more at the end of each month than would  explain the dose missed so at least we have that going for us. Neither of us drink either, she quit a lot of things in solidarity when they told me I had to for seizures....including adderal and caffeine. Once the brain malformation had been removed and the true threat passed I was allowed back on it which is honestly a game changer for me feeling human and I know it is for her to.  In short, this is definitely one I've been lost about but it was the first thing I ever suspected when my wife of 5 years suddenly started dissociating.

She has flashbacks so I'm not sure if that counts as hallucinating. She doesn't during the times when she is up and about. I do think she acts normal after she's up and about but after 48 hours she does become a bit delusional. The second day she's up she makes a lot of promises to people that she can't keep. She'll think I'm being passive aggressive when I'm not. She'll be convinced that I'm the reason she isn't talking to anybody and yells that I've stolen everything from her and this is how I usually know she is triggered now. I used to argue back and assume that caused the episodes and I'm sure it makes it worse. If I say nothing she gets very angry, if I say anything she gets very angry. I've tried every approach I can think of and dealing with it for years breaks your ego apart so I try to recognize any kernel of what I can find truth in and go with that. Nothing works though so I don't know, she gets aggressive and its sad from my end.	Last-Form-4001	follow-up	na	na	na	0.0032403559889644384	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"It's natural for her to feel intense rage after a flashback. The rage is what makes us so irritable and aggressive... The downside is obvious, the upside not so much; rage is a coping mechanism. Survivors typically fair better if they allow themselves to get angry about what happened to them. The alternative to that is blame oneself, and that's dangerous in a different way; that's how self-harm and suicide happen.

That doesn't excuse her behavior toward you though. She is essentially taking things out on you, and the way she talks to you is a form of abuse. While I empathize with her and understand the difficulty she's trying to overcome, she needs to realize that her behavior impacts both you and your child.

 the sooner you confront your fear of vulnerability for the purpose of protection, the better off you will be in the long run.

Avoidance has been a big issue for me, I’ve taken some big steps towards tackling this (about time too) but I still have a long way to go.. and I think it would be strange for us not to be scared.

I guess that when you’re already in a traumatic situation your brain finds comfort in knowing all the facts and what to expect whereas in a safe or positive situation you’re just waiting for things to fall apart and go badly and there’s a suspense/uncertainty to it.

"Yep! Relate with you entirely and completely agree.

I only accepted that vulnerability is imperative to my process and successfully progressing along my healing journey.

That’s great to hear that you choose happiness. I want to choose it to experience it with someone, but I don’t feel deserving of that romantic love.

It’s so incredibly hard to think differently when all I’ve been is ghosted and/or ignored entirely in every dating attempt I’ve made. It’s so easy to feel like they all confirmed that I’m unworthy of any kind of romantic interest, love, or attention. I know they don’t owe me anything and I don’t resent anyone about it at all.

"Last week the painful update I got from my new therapist after she coordinated with the old one is that old therapist had retracted what she said about ""maybe working with me again one day in the future."" That has been painful to deal with over the last week alone.

I go in Friday to our most recent session. It had come up earlier in the week that my therapist had shared something with the new therapist, but she wouldn't tell me because it was already a difficult session, and she ""didn't want to put more on my plate.""

Anyway - I asked her about it again Friday, and she let me know.

When they talked on the phone to coordinate treatment, my therapist said she was ""afraid of her safety"" from me.

I felt completely shocked and asked her why.

She said it was because of what I told her some years ago, probably close to when we started working together in 2017, that I had handled a breakup poorly (in like 2015.) This traumatic breakup was the reason I started seeing my old therapist to begin with. 

She mentioned me ""stalking"" in reference to my breakup, and that was the basis of her fear. I asked the new therapist if she had said anything recent had happened, and my old therapist said no. It's apparently just based on this old info on my breakup.

What I had told my old therapist at the time was that I really regretted how I handled it, and wish I had known better at the time. I also told her it was in large part to me being emotionally out of control because I had a negligent doctor at the time who had me on the maximum dosage of both Adderall XR and IR, and it made me an unstable nutcase. And that I regretted I couldn't tell sooner. For the record, what I had done at the time was call my ex from like Google Voice numbers a handful times over a year or two after she blocked me. It was really stupid and immature and shitty of me, and I wish I had never done it. 

We talked over it me and my new therapist. I saw I was shocked and totally lost. Since my old longtime therapist terminated me, I've contacted her 2-3 times: once a couple days after asking for my notes and referrals because the ones she gave me weren't taking new clients and didn't take medicaid. She said okay give me some time to gather some resources and I'll get back to you. 2 weeks went by and I was still struggling to find a therapist, so I left her a message again just reminding her that I hadn't gotten my notes or referrals yet. Didn't hear back again for like another 48 hours or so, so I sent her a text reminding her again (this wasn't unusual while we were working together because she was at times bad about missing or not returning emails due to her ADHD I guess.) Then she finally sent me my notes, said she didn't have anymore referrals. She also noted that was the last time I would hear back from her, and to take care and that she ""genuinely wished that I end up well again."" I didn't reply. That was the last time I contacted her. This was over a month ago.

I showed my new therapist all of our correspondence since termination and she said everything was legit and shouldn't be considered concerning in any sense. 

And that's all I know.

___

On one hand, I feel absolutely and completely gutted. Here is this person that I attached to and looked up to as a maternal figure for years (at her encouragement), saying these things about me. It has caused some real self hatred the last few days. I feel genuinely worthless that someone I had that bond with would feel that way about me, and just makes me feel like subhuman garbage.  

On the other hand, it feels like she is using something I told her in vulnerable trusting context, in the context of treatment and therapy, and holding it against.

Which ALSO doesn't make sense, because whenever I've talked about that incident and we've talked about boundaries, my old therapist always told me that I was very respectful of her and her boundaries whenever she set them - which was something I was very concerned about considering my past fuck ups.

A suspicious part of my brain is also wondering if she's starting to say this as like a pre-emptive defense because she/her supervisors are apparently super concerned I'm going to report her or something??? In our termination session, the old therapist said ""I was very inappropriate with you, I had inappropriate boundaries, and I hurt you very bad as a result."" Apparently her supervisors were the ones that instructed her to terminate me, and then subsequently retract her ""work together again in the future"" statement in order to ""protect her license and herself professionally""???? But I have no idea where they're coming from because I have never threatened or even mentioned reporting her, or even shown like anger or anything like that during the process.

This also puts on hold something on hold me and the new therapist were working on, drafting an email for me to process and express my feelings about the termination and how it was unethical and hurtful in certain ways, and to ask her to reconsider retracting her ""work together again"" assurance because I have no interest in going after her license or her professionally in any form. So that's off the table for like, bare minimum the rest of this year.

Overall, I'm just at a loss of words. This was the last thing I was expecting to her Friday. My new therapist agreed it was confusing as hell and that I hadn't done anything to warrant that reaction. New therapist suggested maybe, since old therapist was burning out and that was a big factor in the termination, that she's just overall not doing well mentally and having some counter transference towards me (which I know she mentioned a couple years ago being stressed for a bit because another client had crossed some line in contacting her on social media or something in some way?) I also know my therapist has told me many times that she used to be a big mess/trainwreck mentally (in the context of explaining why me feeling like a mess could have hope for getting better like she did), so maybe the burnout/stress is really regressing her?

I have no idea. Long story short, I'm extremely confused and hurting right now. I have no idea what to think or feel about this. I'm just worn out at this point."	Smart_Painting_7513	post	34.97806255067854	female	White	0.9987602233886719	na	na	na	3	ptsd	no prediction.
"Your new therapist should not be reporting on your old therapist, nor should you be taking your new therapists words as Fact since what you describe her as saying generally isn't good for a client's mental health.  

I'd suggest not focusing on old therapists and either find a new one or cease that line of discussion altogether, making that clear to 'em in no uncertain terms.."	Smart_Painting_7513	reply	na	na	na	0.9987602233886719	no	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
I’ve read all your posts and man… this is a her problem. I know it doesn’t help and I know it hurts but she clearly realized she fucked up, she even admitted that she hurt you very badly! This other stuff, honestly I don’t think your therapist should be telling you this. The pain will fade. It will still hurt, but it won’t be where you are now. You have to try to regulate and keep yourself sane for the time being. I promise it gets easier, but I’m not sure if posting over and over is helping you.

This doesn't sound like as much of a you problem, it sounds like your old therapist may have been called out by a client and forced to terminate some/all clients to fix the issue. There's too much going on to know for sure. Move on. Therapists make mistakes, aren't great at their jobs, etc sometimes.

"Going through something I can’t really talk to anyone about and need to sort things out in my head. 

My bf and I have been together for a year and half. He has severe ptsd, work-related that was diagnosed a few years before we met. He had a relapse soon after we met but we stuck it out and are finally out on the other side. 

About a month ago an incident occurred with another friend’s dog that I was pet sitting while I was on the phone with him. I knew he was completely freaked out just hearing it, he helped me through it but at the end of the call he said that he needed the evening to himself. I took the pup to emerg and I could feel myself spiralling. Had a friend there with me to help out. I tried reaching out to him but he just texted that needs to get to bed an shut me out (I know he shuts down a bit when things are overwhelming, it’s something we have been through in the past) but he gave no further explanation. That evening I sent an email to his therapist (I know it was a bad move on my part given everything going on) to check in on him the next day. I was worried that this event triggered his ptsd in some way and I didn’t know if he was going to reach out the following day. I was scared and just wanted him to be safe (as in not relapsing or experiencing any symptoms). The next day was normal. He let me know that his therapist reached out because of me. 

In the following days he began to get upset about what I did. After a conversation with his therapist he said that he felt violated and that I had inserted myself in his safe space. He said that that evening his body began mimicking ptsd symptoms, which really tore me up. We’ve been carrying out for the past few weeks ‘normally’ but I know it hangs between us. A few days ago he requested space to process it to see if he can get over it as requested/discussed with his therapist. I know what I did wasn’t right and I know I would have probably felt the same way. 

I guess I’m just feeling really sad. We generally just have a very good relationship and have struggled to build what we have through some very dark moments. And I feel that if he cannot move past it, this would be it for us and it breaks my heart I’ve hurt him in a way that I never intended to. I even told him that I want what’s best for him even if it means walking away. 

I don’t know how or what to do to recover from this. Is there any advice on what I can do to give him back control and make him feel safe again?"	fancyribeye__	post	28.95234768436496	female	White	0.9941369295120239	na	na	na	3	ptsd	failed

It was constant traumatic situations and the aftermath for what my brain perceived as weeks of time and I still have some residual emotions from that and I feel *awfulll*

"I (27f) am happily married to a very supportive wife (27f). The relationship before though was very emotionally and psychologically abusive and it took a while for me to get back to being myself. I was joking around with my wife picking on her and just messing around when my wife threw a small stuffed animal (maybe the size of a pomegranate) to me and it hit my leg. I wear glasses and I was in the process of putting them on when my wife threw it from across the room. As I saw the object (I couldn't see it was a stuffed animal) flying in my direction I froze and my heart stopped. I remembered a fight with my ex in which she threw plastic candles at me while screaming when we were having an argument. 
Now my wife is completely aware of my past both with my ex and growing up in a household dealing with domestic violence, physical, emotional and psychological abuse. And she would never do anything to intentionally hurt me. She saw my face and she ran over and made sure I was okay. Like I said we were both messing around and being silly the moment just triggered me for some reason and it just makes me so mad. Here I am in a happy marriage living my best life and then I get triggered by something and it feels like I'm back at square one. It just feels so unfair like as soon as you feel free or can even forget for a while something just takes you back to the beginning. And I don't know about anyone else but it almost feels embarrassing to feel triggered by stuff anymore its like as if my brain thinks that with time I'm ""fixed"".

MAJOR TW: Homicide 
I know this is a PTSD community, so it's to be expected that there will be some triggering posts in here. But if I can help others navigate what they read, I will.


My father was brutally murdered last October. The way he left this world is not something I'd wish on my worse enemy.

About a week after I found out and went through the process of putting him to rest, I had a major freak out moment. I ended up at the beach and screamed my head off that life was unfair.  I cried and shouted until I couldn't anymore.

I still have moments. Not exactly as intense as that night, but as we go through the process of his court trial, I have my moments where I just want someone to hear me out when I need to yell that life is unfair.


I'm assuming your intention behind this post was just to vent, but I want you to know that it's okay to feel like life is unfair. Because it absolutely is. It sucks, it's mean, and sometimes it drowns you. I don't want to offer unsolicited advice, so please ignore me if you want... but something that helps me in those moments is to write down five things that I'm grateful for. It's a simple act and it's definitely cliché. Like telling someone who's struggling with depression to just exercise. Writing down just five things, no matter how big or small, makes life a litte more bearable.


I wish you well, my friend.

Recently as me and most of my friends have been hitting the age of 18/19 everyone has been maturing through life a lot more and with the way things are for me I feel like I’m being held back by my trauma and possibly me being high on the autism spectrum but seeing and hearing some of my closest friends talk about how they are getting intimate and moving out soon scares me so much as I don’t want to be alone or lose anyone else again and I’m able to be happy for them to them but I’m just so scared of what could happen if everyone moves away and I’m just stuck alone again, I can’t go back to how things were before as I’ve started to actually improve but whenever someone mentions how they might move out even by the end of the year it just sends me into a state of sadness for the whole day.	ameliasniffy	post	16.21265929907477	female	White	0.9962278604507446	na	na	na	1	ptsd	no prediction.

Was raped in 5th grade. Tried to tell the teacher but didnt really understand. Kinda went along like nothing happened. Didn't know how to cope and it was mostly shame and guilt towards myself. Conscious thinking, help of my bf made me overcome this and acknowledge I'm not the one at fault. Now I'm just having somatic flashbacks when I'm closing my eyes and tryna go to sleep. It just feels gross after that and I wanna peel my skin off, take a bath in the cleanest water possible, bleach it off, etc. Grounding or tryna avoid thinking about it is hard doesn't work.

"I really want to be understanding, but im seriously worried about her. I know what happened to her, i know exactly why she has ptsd, but she was using drugs before the incident. The incident happened after she moved out for college, and shes been using drugs since she was still in high school. As far as i know it wasn’t anything crazy. 

Anyway, i always knew she would smoke weed in moderation, which i dont really care about because she never lost focus on school or anything. Anyway, the incident was horrible, honestly i dont know if i could have handled it as well as she did. But, she has started smoking a shit ton more weed, and tried hard drugs. I got frustrated with her for it, because she goes to a really good university and im worried that she’ll throw it all away. 

I stayed at her apartment for a weekend recently and i dont think she was sober for even a second. I dont do drugs because im trying to make my college baseball team, so I tried to talk to her about it, but she just kept saying “i have ptsd i need this” and then i would drop it. But eventually she ended up driving me while she was high, and almost got into a really bad accident, and then when i asked her why she smoked weed before driving me she got pissed at me and said that i don’t understand what its like to have ptsd. I really dont want to come off as insensitive but i really think she’s using her ptsd as an excuse to get high all day and not take responsibility for her actions."

From experience, I don’t think PTSD is an excuse so much as it is the reason, or at least the reason for the addiction getting worse.

"I have so much to say about this I don't know where to start.

If this is the path she is choosing as a means to cope with her trauma or something else, there is literally nothing you can do to stop her. It's tragic, it's hard to watch, it's taxing on everyone who cares about the person, and there is absolutely nothing you can do (unless you're independently wealthy and can financially support her indefinitely with housing, meals, transportation, entertainment, psychotherapy, somatic therapy, spiritual counseling, reintegration,  etc.)

Trauma has the power to rewrite a person's entire being; to raze the very foundation of who a person thinks they are, and make them question everything they've ever known. PTSD often involves an uncontrollable amplification of whatever fears exist as a result of the trauma, which means that from an outside perspective its easy to think the person should move on or get better or whatever, but internally the person is stuck in a loop where they are never able to escape the memory of the event or the story they are telling themselves about it. This gets compounded when we label ourselves as having PTSD because that label reinforces the idea that we are powerless and broken - and healing that tangle of psychosomatic disregulation takes a long time and a LOT of effort. Drugs use and abuse is a very straightforward way of not having to face the fear and shame and powerlessness and uncertainty of literally being undone from the inside out.

It's completely understandable that you would be concerned for your sister, and even understandable that you might be angry or want to try to hold her accountable for her current behavior. But you also might consider that your feelings on her behavior do not matter (to her) at all. They pale in comparison to the intensity of the horror she is already experiencing, self-inflicted or not. She's in the pit, and she can't get herself out until she is ready to see the path out.

I've been on both sides of this coin, as the sober loved one watching the addict unravel, and as the post-trauma addicted train wreck. As the former, I tried everything to help, for years, and giving up and accepting them for who they were and what they were going through was the best move I made in all that time. As the addict, there was nothing left of the old me for other people's words to have an impact on. It took the death of someone I loved more than anything to rock me out of the addiction cycle and put me on a healing path. Then it took 5 years of sobriety before I could even begin to deal with my ptsd.

Whether she is using her ptsd as an ""excuse"" or not is hard to say without more information, but the important thing here is that you take care of yourself. Be honest with yourself about how this makes you feel. Seek counseling if you need help processing your own experience as this is going on. Know that you and your sister both are on your own paths, and if you can, try not to judge her for making these choices. It's impossible to know the choices you would make in her shoes, and we are all out here doing the best we can with the knowledge we've been given and the experiences we've had."

"Maybe something else traumatic happened to her in high school or beforehand that she never talked to you guys about like bullying or something.  That or maybe she had another diagnosed mental health issue that she was trying to self medicate. Either way, maybe the traumatic incident maybe exasperated it more. It's not necessarily an excuse to use drugs but a lot of people who do drugs, typically use them to self medicate undiagnosed mental illnesses or in some cases even diagnosed mental illnesses. 

Edit: I know that some individuals find relief with their mental illnesses (depending on what it is) and chronic pain because of that one chemical in weed but it's medical marijuana.

No. She is using drugs to help her cope with her ptsd. She might have had ptsd prior that you didn’t know about, or she might not have and just liked smoking. You need to give her support right now or at least point her in the right direction of a good therapist. If you know she’s high or drunk, don’t get in the car with her. Like someone else said ptsd is the reason and not the excuse for why she’s constantly high and having trouble taking responsibility. She needs some help.

"It’s really hard but the best thing you can do is love her with boundaries and maybe from a distance. I’m sure she sees you care. I think for yourself and for her you want to save her. You seen it too much so like you said you don’t want that for her. If you try and push her too much she might push you away. 

Our behavior is like on a track. Our subconscious usually just does things on autopilot. It’s usually not until a trauma happens that we can readjust. I’ve heard psychedelics also can have that effect. I have healed from PTSD but it took years. People really have to live through their pain until they can heal.

Substance abuse is very comorbid with PTSD. I turned into an alcoholic. She will get help, if and when, she wants it. It’s self medicating. It may be the only thing keeping her going at the moment. It will be ok until it’s not. That’s when she has to be ready to face her demons. Until then, all you can do is be a supportive sibling. Life with PTSD is hard enough without family members being judgmental. It sounds like she has some self awareness about her drug use. Maybe, with enough support, she will be able to let go of the weed. Maybe not, but whatever the outcome, just support her as a person who is trying to survive.

I understand as well from a loved ones perspective and a church leader and minister perspective. My mother was a decorated doctor of more than 20 years, trained me for 17 years of my life in medicine, but I came to find out that she had been prescribing prescription narcotics (Demerol, Oxycintin, Oxycodone, Percocet, Methadone) in her name and in my name as well for four years. Federal Authorities found out, She went to drug rehab on a plea deal after I also almost went to Federal Prison myself for 10 years because they thought I was having her get them for me to sell. My mother died of her addiction 13 years ago. I live with regret, the horror of questions, memories and the secret of it all kept from my sister to this day as I hid her addiction very well from my sister. Please get her help if you can. Don't take excuses, don't take compromises, flattery or joking of any kind. It is a ploy to get what she wants and regret will set in when she dies. I have counseled many loved ones who have lost such to addiction as well as lost friends to it and a mother, my only parent. I am living proof that one never needs drugs or alcohol to ease pain. Survivor of child abuse and torture of six years in an orphanage, Survivor of Domestic Violence, witness to two others as well, survivor of attempted murder by a marine veteran and losing over 30 friends to death, 26 of which died in my arms. I have never done drugs, never drank a drop of alcohol because I just knew that I would never stop, I would have every reason not to, plus I have hated such for a long time. Drugs and alcohol addiction is a choice, one of desperation to ease pain, it is not a disease, but it is a choice always because you are left hurt by their actions as you have confessed here. If it were a disease, I would not be necessary as minister/counselor. A choice will be either three things, Beneficial, regretful (Hurtful) or destructive to all parties involved. There are no others. Hope this helps, I am so sorry you are dealing with such, I am sorry for being so blunt in a way, but there is no substitute for the seriousness of this situation.

"I don’t think it’s an excuse it’s a reason. I was highly functional and productive before a second trauma in my life since which I struggle with PTSD. I was a mild smoker before and tried different drugs but I was very focused on being productive and drugs were never a big feature of my life just experimental other than weed which featured in my life like alcohol does others.

Post assault I smoked heavily and I used it as a major crutch. It kept me calm and stopped me hurting myself during the acute stage until I could manage myself better.

"Sorry but I don’t agree with this at all. She is not a victim, she is not not “forced” to abuse drugs. This is a ridiculous statement and a harmful one. 

Like most of us, we’re all struggling with PTSD. We seek professional help, we submit to the treatment protocols prescribe to us by our therapists. We take the medication prescribed.

This girl is not forced to abuse anything. It’s like saying someone is forced to abuse their spouse. Just stop.

The brother needs to set boundaries. The sister needs help, should submit to treatment and not use her drug problem as an excuse. I smoke week occasionally myself but not for one second do I use my diagnosis as an excuse.

Her defensiveness when her drug use is raised by her brother indicates she has a usage issue.

As far as bullying goes she never had any bullies. She wasnt popular per se but nobody had a problem with her and she didnt have a problem with anybody else. Our dad was always a dick though, he made me hate food because he would use foods as a punishment for me and he was verbally abusive.

The right help is better than what she's doing. Unfortunately, PTSD makes the person who has it feel worthless and like no one understands. And not a lot of people are going to understand. Sadly, one group of people usually understands, and that group of people are in active addiction or cults like AA/NA. They understand, but they're also really unhealthy.

"When I found out I had PTSD, meaning I Googled my symptoms and happened to have a few tiny frames of memory surface, I called a therapist office pleading with them for help. You know what they asked me? ""Do you have insurance?""

That ""help"" wasn't there for me at all. The rape crisis center did nothing to advocate for me because I was ""an adult"" even through I was still living in my parent/abusers house. I was 22 years old. I needed help. Psychotherapy isn't available to people who can't pay or can't put their heads on good enough to even go to work. I ended up homeless while the world watched. 

I felt so alone after feeling alone my whole life. All I ever felt was alone and no one was swooping in to change that. There were no support groups. There was fucking nothing.

You're talking about treatment? Do you know how much that costs? And if it's free, do you have any idea how shitty and 12 step the treatment will be, exposing her to a bunch of other unhealed mentally fucked up people being forced into sobriety with some Christian based rhetoric?

By the sounds of it you're very privileged and have access to all the necessary support and assistance you need to access specialist professional treatment. 

Not all of us have that birthright and have to find alternative ways in which we can cope because we don't have any loving support or understanding..
Not to mention, how difficult it is to access the appropriate treatment or medication. 

In which case, we are forced to self medicate in whichever way we possibly can because the repercussions of not, can be terrifyingly dire. 

We spend years trying to survive because we are denied the right to live. This causes more trauma, exacerbated even further by uneducated opinions and unsolicited advice, which only continues to get worse with time as we systematically re - traumatized reinforcing our need to self medicate.

It’s sad to watch too people close to me make such radically different decisions and the difference between them now later in life is massive. My eldest is healthier and has lots of friends and is making a positive impact while my middle sister is a recluse and alcoholic.

There is nothing anyone can do to change the decisions that they make and continue to make.

OP you must be in pain to see this but all you can do is encourage and be firm in your boundaries. If your sister gets abusive or defensive you can set further boundaries with her about how she treats you and then you may be forced to love her from a distance.

I didn’t want help because I was so scared of a life without drinking because I didn’t know how I would ever cope.

I'm sorry you had to go through that. I didn't mean it in a bad way though. What i meant was that perhaps you were using something as an escape from traumatic thoughts that were going out of your control. Maybe these thoughts were so intense that in the lack of proper help it seemed like alcohol was the only way to remain sane. Clearly it didn't work. I'm glad you have found a way out of it and that you have healthier ways of dealing with these thoughts now. It takes a lot of strength to recognise an addiction and a great deal more to overcome it despite the justifications you may have given yourself to continue doing it. You did the right thing by choosing to let go of it. You should be proud that you got yourself out of it. You're not weak at all.

"*disclaimer* I don't have ptsd nor am I claiming to have it
Someone just adviced me to post it on here.

Hi, I'm using a grammar app to help me write this because of my grammar and punctuation. I've been homeschooled since 2nd grade, taken out because of seizures and grandma being sick. I was diagnosed with dislexia and was suppose to be evaluated for asd and ADHD, but my grandmother was against it. She also claims I wasn't bullied in school, so... Anyway, she took me out of school and just bought me books and expected me to learn them on my own. She punished me when I didn't do my school work when I was depressed, which has been since I was taken out of school.


Basically I was never taught anything
Just how to clean, cook, medical stuff (that's all I've been studying) because I want to be a paramedic.

But, I had to take care of my sick grandma: change her diapers, take her poop/pee, feed her, change her feeding tube, ect. Up until her death, which really traumatized me. I'm not mad, but I do feel like my childhood was taken from me. I genuinely loved my her and always will, but I also had to cook, clean, bathe my grandmother, ect. This all started when I was in 2nd grade, so I had no support system, no friends, yeah.. I've never really had any friends. Probably because of my social anxiety and just hating people in general

Whenever I tried to do my school work, my grandmother told me to clean the house or just yelled at me, and she's really emotionally abusive and neglectful, so cps has been out multiple times, but they didn't care. I tried to kill myself multiple times and failed. I was taken to many mental hospitals and diagnosed with mental disorders, which I wasn't surprised to have, but whatever right...

But back to what I was saying: I have the education of a 2nd grader. I'm about to be in 10th grade, but nobody will enroll me in school. I've tried, but they won't do it without an adult, not even my older sister, who was in the same situation. I hate it so much. I don't know how my sister graduated at the top of her class. I know she's intelligent but damn. I'm a idiot. People tell me otherwise, but I know they're lying. I'm almost 16 and I still struggle with adding, subtracting, multiplication, division, ect. I hate myself

I hate everyone..
People make fun of me because I talk like a robot.
I don't know why I talk that way
Also, because I have sensory issues... I don't know why I'm like this

My genetics are shit
They said my birth mother was mr and had asd... Wonder what my birth father gave me

Well, feel free to roast me I really don't care anymore
Sorry for the essay I just wrote
Just expressing my thoughts or emotions? Ig"	Double-Knowledge-711	post	13.81518648068811	female	White	0.9979367256164551	na	na	na	2	ptsd	no prediction.

"I have experience with this. I developed psychosis from PTSD compounding due to being abused by my child’s father (he’s dead now, more on that in a sec) - my bio mom, my step mom and no one believing me because of how I was getting it from all ends sounded so unbelievable. It literally drove me crazy. 

It gets better. You won’t connect to your life before this happened- you’re having to repair and “build” a new brain. I’m still having random psychotic thoughts that I observe instead of believe. These thoughts get triggered by certain things people say- but then I remember it was literally psychotic and not true and what I’m “thinking” isn’t true- just a triggered thought response from the PTSD. 

When my daughters dad passed away my PTSD symptoms nearly halved. I still struggle feeling safe at my house because his brother is still alive and idk what he’s capable of. But it does get better. 

What helped me was finding a new but lowkey hobby: I took up indigenous beadwork and started trying to reconnect with my community because during my psychosis I didn’t trust a damn SOUL. 

I posted on next door app what happened to me- to put myself out there. I apologized to neighbors who saw me at my worse. It’s been years since it happened- and it will take at least 6 months to a year to feel “completely normal” again."	Substantial_Bet_4605	reply	na	na	na	0.9938626289367676	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

I find exercise, cooking meals, walking my dog, walking meditation, riding my bike, shit like that to get me to the present moment. While I’m doing them I don’t feel better for some time and I sometimes have to parent myself to do the things. 

I make notes of shit I need to do to get stable.

It’s been 3 years since trauma happened, and wow did i support SO much of it. I know that it happened, but all those ugly feelings from that experience are just now resurfacing. I now remember all the shame, all the sadness, the fear, the feeling completely hopelessnes, everything.

I can only imagine how hard it must be for you. It happened to me when I was in my early twenties. (The trauma happened to me when I was a kid.) My therapist had a theory about this, saying that when our minds feel like we're in a safe place, or have become more resilient, it sends feelings we suppressed during the trauma.

I suppressed my feelings of my initial trauma (age 13) toward it but not the memories. I just told myself that it was a normal experience for teens. It took me 30 years to realize it wasn’t a normal part of growing up and that I was actually raped. This happened in therapy and it hit me like a mountain had fallen on me and all of it surfaced.

Suppression is crazy common. Suppression is how we get through the immediate. It's a trauma response. You suppress everything short term so that you can get away, get safe, get healed so that you can then deal with it.

I suppressed the emotion of shame.  I didn’t really let myself feel that at all until my late 30s.  And when I opened that door…  sometimes I can’t breathe for the shame I feel for some things I’ve done.  I wish I could block out the memories.

"Yes, I did. I’d hide it as well as I could until I finally had to do something to cover it up… so I drank. I did anything and everything I could to ease the pain until I finally had enough and I sat on the edge of my bed, and held an instantaneous answer to my pain and thought it through as well as I could with such a clouded mind. I made the decision to actually apply myself to therapy (I had been going for years as an attempt to show that I was “trying” to save my marriage, but was dodging the things that really bothered me). 

It does suck, especially when you’re forced to confront the pain. But you’re an extremely strong person who’s gotten this far… you’ve got this! Don’t let yourself sink into too much of a hole. Try getting out and doing a few things you enjoy, but take it easy. It’s normal to need more rest and down time.

I suppressed a lot of the trauma that happened when I was younger. The things that have happened more recently I’ve managed to work through, possibly because I’m just better at facing it now. I get that to suppress and forget is a coping mechanism, but I have some pretty big issues that I don’t know if I will ever fully recover from.

"Just my antidote. I grew up in a cult and was sexually abused as a child. I literally was so stressed early in my life. I was very uneducated about how the real world works because I was home schooled and I struggled through community college often failing out despite my best efforts. I ran away to live with my best friend years ago hundreds of miles away. I had a super abusive boss and I felt like I was in survival mode. Then my best friend got married so I moved to the only place that I could afford which was a slum house built in the 20s that flooded with sewage often. I was literally barely making by. 

Finally through a lot of work and thanks to online cheap education I got a shit ton of IT certifications and I am making more money than I have ever imagined I would make and moved to a safe clean place. 

That's when I went crazy. I felt fine for the first month but then nightmares came. I've been going through PTSD therapy and I was super happy when the doctor said it is very normal. The human brain does trick itself just to get by and shit will re-surface when you are finally calm and feel safe. Your brain is used to being on edge and will seek threats when none exist when you are traumatized. 

I am still going through it so I don't have concrete advice except for don't feel guilty. It's not your fault that you feel these feelings.

With practice it will gets better. Now most of the time, I can pull myself out after experience very intense pain.

"TW: SA, ED, and suicide. I'm really struggling

I was getting into cnc before what happened to me and had been fantasizing about being sa'd for a while before and after I was sa'd by my ex-roomate. after it happened I didn't think of it really seriously and thought it didn't affect me too much but I told her I didn't wanna do anything sexual with her anymore.

after it happened tho I got suuuuuuper into cnc and started looking at more cnc videos and stuff and it took me a while to realize but I think I was self harming. cause I was imagining myself in their shoes and feeling all that fear and vulnerability and I can't stop thinking that me doing that is what fucked me up the most

cause my flashbacks to my actual SA aren't that terrible recently.  every time I would have sex with someone after it happened, it always made me feel like I just have to let them finish and I can't say no even if I WANT TO. like before it happened (even after I got into cnc) I could say no. I would. I remember saying no but EVERY TIME since it happened, I've just sat there panicking while disassociated and only said anything after the fact. usually over text

any time anyone touches me at all or is near me or says anything sightly flirty towards me, another version of me is just ITCHING thinking of all the things they're GONNA do to me. also it feels like the me in my head that keeps imagining things is getting more confident in touching me even after I'm screaming to stop and idk what to do. I know yelling at myself doesn't really do much but idk what else to do

I don't wanna feel those things anymore I'm so tired. it's like I'll try to scream loud enough at the exact frequency that I fucking wipe out any version of myself that feels like doing that shit just to torture myself or for dopamine or whatever but now even when I do that, sometimes I feel them touching me RIGHT AFTER IMMEDIATELY and like saying weird shit and I'll immediately feel bad and upset but then continue to fucking do it and I DON'T KNOW HOW TO STOP

it's so maddening I just wanna feel safe I'm so tired of these thoughts. I'm really wanting to just end it. I have for a long time but it's just getting to be too much. I have reasons to want to live but this shit just doesn't feel worth it anymore. I was suicidal a year ago just from my health issues and trauma and everything has gotten SO MUCH WORSE since then. I don't honestly see how or why I've made it this far. I feel like silly. like why would anyone keep trying

my life just got fucked up. I don't get a do over I just don't wanna keep trying to put back together the pieces whenever all it takes is someone not listening when I say no and now I have PTSD 🤪 I JUST WISH I COULD CUDDLE WITH MY GF I miss it sm

it's so maddening. it'll feel so amazing at first and maybe even for a good couple minutes but the intrusive fantasies always creep in. it just always puts me into that headspace no matter how much I kick and scream trying to stay out of it and just enjoy the cuddling

how do I just keep on trying like this. physical touch is a main love language of mine I just wish she could hold meeeeeeee 😭 why do I have to go through this I don't deserve this I don't want it please just take it from me please I just wanna get out of my head I hate it here it took years to stop hating myself before it happened. I actually had a positive inner monologue for once. that's probably the most gut wrenching part of it all

I GOT TO BE HAPPY FOR A LITTLE WHILE. I got a little less than a year and a half before my health issues started. it took a while for it to get really bad but I made my first real attempt while I was waiting on hearing back from my doctor

it all crumbled so fast. I WAS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSON. I feel so disgusting now. I hate myself. I can't get out of my head. any slight issue makes me wanna kms SO FUCKING BAD

like the urge is there without it but bad things keep happening and I'm just like getting pushed past my fucking limit over and over and over again and everyone is really supportive and understanding of me for the most part but no amount of support can make l this bearable for much longer

I was genuinely thinking I might just starve to death at some point soon because of how bad my ed has been but I just keep on barely making it day to day and I wanna eat better so I can stop being sick all the time but I can't fucking get my body to do something it doesn't want to do. like I can physically only get food down my throat when I'm STARVING and being starving makes eating harder. 

it's never not really difficult to get down any more than a small snack. before everything started falling apart, l was actually eating fairly regularly. arfid (from spd) never goes away really even with great support and hard work it only gets better like in terms of how many panic attacks you have while trying to get yourself to eat and how severely you are malnourished and how much you hate yourself over it

so I have to appreciate the fact that I was somewhat kinda eating remotely enough food but I was! I would also get excited to eat which I pretty much never do now but I'd just settle for not having daily shutdowns and panic attacks while trying to do the thing I have to do EVERY FUCKING DAY just so I can keep on trying to distract myself from my PTSD and l other issues unsuccessfully. I wish I could just disappear forever

 I'm in therapy btw if you're wondering"	IvyWhyV	post	19.383847941690988	female	White	0.997663140296936	na	na	na	2	ptsd	failed

"I struggle to control it but I manage it in a few ways:


- Lexapro helps me. I read an article which illuminated why. It's quite complicated but basically it impacts the amygdala in a regulating way. 

- Go for walk whilst listening to rock, melancholic, punk hardcore etc music.

- Do weights. This helps the anger-anxiety combo I get. Even 15 minutes calms me down.

- Keep up talk therapy. Tell my T anything that is upsetting, irritating or angering me. Let it all out. Don't hide things, they come out in other ways.

- Boxing with another person or dummy worked a few times. But I also felt very fatigued after. 

- Sleep off anger before acting it out. 

- Writing on Reddit - exactly how I feel. 

- When all else fails, allow yourself to argue with the person that has hurt you or pissed you off. Have it out.

"I guess the question is…what are you angry about? Your anger is telling you something about your environment and the state of your body. Controlling emotions is not about stopping yourself from having them - you literally cannot do that unless you want some very bad things to happen - it’s about controlling the way in which you express them so that you don’t hurt other people.

Before you can control your anger reaction, you need to understand WHY. I noticed that most of the time I’m angry is because I’m stressed out, in a hurry, or someone treats me poorly. Some of those I can avoid, some I can minimize and some I just have to deal with. But the broader point is, start seeing if you change the thing that causes your anger, instead of stopping yourself from being angry. 

Someone told me once, that once you notice you’re thirsty, you’re already dehydrated, and you need to work extra hard to get back to normal. Anger is the same way. Sometimes once you feel it come through, it’s too late to stop your reaction. So to the extent that you can, you need to manage your environment so that it never gets to that point. Lately, when I start to feel angry, the sensation is much milder and I’m able to say, “okay, I’m feeling angry now, so I need to go sit down somewhere quiet.” 

Medication is often useful for people who can’t get to that point alone, or are having extreme anger issues. So I agree with other posters that medication can help, but it’s just one piece of a strategy."	livi261	reply	na	na	na	0.9993840456008911	no	no	strong	na	ptsd	failed
Pause and breathe before you respond. Take a walk. Practice breathing techniques regularly (box breathing, 478 technique) so you can use them when you get irritated. Don’t let yourself get too hungry or thirsty, low blood sugar and dehydration can make you irritable.	livi261	reply	na	na	na	0.9993840456008911	no	no	no	na	ptsd	failed
I agree with this. Anger cannot and will not be controlled from being felt, but you can learn how to respond differently in healthier ways. Journaling how I'm feeling helps me. The anger I have felt about what traumatized me is honestly scary \*just how angry I felt\*  I don't like feeling that angry in that way, so I'm learning how to deal with it in better ways.	livi261	reply	na	na	na	0.9993840456008911	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

If I feel like I’m getting irritated, I excuse myself and leave the situation, and walk outside until the anger passes, getting my breathing under control. It’s important to catch it during that irritation stage, because anger can be unpredictable and explosive at times (especially in an emotional flashback or when you are triggered). I also try to stay away from people and situations I know will trigger me. Take care.	livi261	reply	na	na	na	0.9993840456008911	no	no	no	na	ptsd	failed

I understand, I have the same issue. Noticing when you are getting irritable can be tricky. Practicing mindfulness and noticing your feelings (outside of when you are angry or irritable), helps. Just naming your feelings, for example, Oh, I feel happy right now, or I am excited. A lot of us are trained from early childhood not to show feelings, so it can be hard to recognize them.	livi261	reply	na	na	na	0.9993840456008911	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
"Tldr: He suffered a cardiac tamponade that led to sudden onset hypotension, and his IV got pulled out, which led to hypovolemic shock.

The patient had come to the hospital, complaining of severe chest pain and weakness, and had said he suffered clots before, so he was given blood thinners to treat it. Around 12:50 AM i got a call from his room. It was his wife, screaming about excessive bleeding and her husband throwing up. 

I stepped into his room, and it was like a scene straight out of a horror movie. I truly do not mean to crassly compare it to something like but I have no idea how else to express it. As soon as I stepped into his room I went into instant panic mode because of what I saw. I froze up. My mind went blank.

His bed was so saturated in blood  that it went through all of his linens and was covering the mattress. His blankets were so soaked that it was dripping on to the floor. His gown was completely black because he was so bleeding out so much. His IV had been torn out of his arm and he was just pouring blood everywhere.

I tried so hard to stop it. The floor was slick with his blood that I fell and nearly split my own head open trying to get to the emergency staff button. I tried so hard. The towels. The gauze. There just so much bleeding that it went through everything.

His face turned so white. I had never seen anything so terrifying in my life. All i can see when I close my eyes is the color draining from his face.

His blood pressure went from 127/79 to 42/30. He was dead at 1:35 AM.

I don't know what to do. I've changed my clothes. I've written this out. I cried. But all I can think of is all that blood. His dying face. He was shaking so much.

He came in and was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism when he had a cardiac tamponade and we gave him blood thinners for a clot that didn't exist.

I can't help but think we killed him. I can't stop thinking what if I had gotten there a few minutes earlier? What if I hadn't froze at the door? Maybe I could have prevented his IV from being ripped out. Maybe I could hace saved his life. My mind is tearing itself apart. I feel sick thinking about it. I had his blood running down my arms. The sound of his,wife screaming at me to stop his bleeding.

I don't know how to deal with this. I'm shaking, and all I can think about is his face and all that blood. I can't sleep. I can't think about anything else."	AnimeDreama	post	16.68578122668757	male	White	0.9935471415519714	na	na	na	75	ptsd	no prediction.

"If you are not already seeing a therapist, you need to proactively set up therapy. Like... ASAP. You work in healthcare, and I'm sure you're very busy. I'm sure acknowledging *you* need help/support is a terrifying thought for a whole list of reasons both rational and not.

Waiting, repressing, &/or trying to ignore this will make it much, much worse in the long run. You are a medical professional, and now you yourself need one.

It sounds like you did everything you reasonably could. Errors happen, even in medicine. People die and we can't always save them. Sometimes we make bad guesses. Sometimes we don't have all the context. I'm so sorry this happened. That's horrific.

"I have been here twice before we two patients, its horrible. First time i was working ICU, second on the ward i am in now. First time we called the major haemorrage pathway and worked for hours trying to stop the bleeding. Second time the patient hamorraged in the space of 20mins before we went back into the room because we have isolated rooms being an infectious diseases unit, she was ready to go home so no monitors or anything needed, DNACPR, had already stopped breathing etc. After the second time i couldn't face going into them double doored neg pressure rooms without seeing all the blood as i stepped in, i was proactive with therapy and she helped me work through it. It took a bit of time and avoiding the specific room for a few weeks but eventually i was okay enough to go into that room. I am so sorry this happened.

"I had a similar experience at my job. It wasn’t even my patient but it was a traumatizing code blue that started with the most seasoned nurse I know screaming my name at the top of her lungs. The pure panic in her voice…when I ran in the room, I understood why. Blood everywhere…so much so that we all had to clean our shoes off at the end and mop the floors. I thought about that code for weeks afterwards. I’ve had other instances, that still bother me. Most nurses I know have PTSD.

Medication helps. I’m on Zoloft, propranolol and Prazosin, which has kept my panic attacks away. 

Therapy can also be beneficial, but make sure you find a trauma informed therapist. The first therapist I had would bring up the trauma and not help me close it down / pack it away at the end of the session, which resulted in panic attacks and nightmares for weeks. A good therapist will help you close the door to your trauma before ending the session."	AnimeDreama	reply	na	na	na	0.9935471415519714	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

"At the root of it, this death was a tragedy. 

Similar to a serious auto collision, the visually graphic chaos lingers in one's memory in stark contrast to one's sense of helplessness and the subsequent unfounded guilt arising from that.

The problem is, tragedy isn't rational. The mind will endlessly return to the event, replaying it in an effort to make sense of the experience; but ""making sense"" is itself a rationalization. Trauma is a mainly sensory experience, not a cognitive one. 

Therapy will certainly help, but in the meantime remember that *thinking* about the event can't ""solve"" a trauma: Your body needs to *feel* safe. Start practicing breathing exercises that calm your heart rate, several times a day. Having been conditioned by consistent effort, gradually the body learns to automatically calm itself from as little as a single deep breath. (I learned to practice breath meditation in combination with listening to Brian Eno's extremely therapeutic ""Ambient 1: Music for Airports""; now just hearing the first few notes of that album is enough to trigger calm.)

Processing a tragedy takes time. While tthere's no quick and easy cure, the combination of therapy with meditative practices (like breathwork) will help."	AnimeDreama	reply	na	na	na	0.9935471415519714	no	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"Nobody can diagnose over the internet. But the situation you describe does sound very traumatic. Take the time you need as far as your circumstances allow.

I'm sorry this happened to you. Trauma stems from being powerless in my experience. That's why it is very important that you seek help with people that actually know the medical field and have experience in it.

"I'm an ocean lifeguard, rescue swimmer and paramedic. I have seen many violent deaths in my time. There were two distinct moments that led to two very distinct realizations for me.

The first one was about 4 years ago now, when I spent an entire 13 hour shift lifeguarding with some omnious pain in my ankle and foot. The minute I clocked out, the pain got so bad I nearly vomited. When I saw the foot was swollen, I drove myself to the emergency room and they did an X-ray. I found out that I had broken my ankle and two bones in my foot. By some miracle these breaks were all not moved and didn't destabilise my foot. Naturally, I wondered when it happened. I pondered for a good hour on that hospital bed, when I eventually had to admit to myself that A) I didn't know and B) I had lost myself so much in concentration for 13 hours that I literally forgot to register pain. That forced me to think further. Why did I immerse myself so much in the job that didn't feel it? I had to come to the conclusion that, like everyone in this field of work, I'm very emphatic and I have a strong sense of duty. I still remember that on that day, I was all-care for two dislocations and a severe laceration. But I didn't check in on myself once. Empathy and dutifulness can be backstabbers. Others will always view them as good qualities with no downsides. When empathy turns to losing yourself and dutifulness turns to overthinking and guilt, it'll be you who feels it. You alone. 

The second one was quite recently, about 4 months ago. We were at a family gathering and the topic of my work came up. People got curious and asked questions, I answered them. The usual. All of the sudden my uncle looked me in the eyes with such a genuinely sad expression. It completely contrasted the general mood in the room. He himself was a social worker, focused on addiction, mental health and family matters, but he only got into that line of work fairly late in his life. I've been thinking a lot about what he said next ever since. He said: (most accurate translation to English I can muster) ""You're only 24 and you've seen so much sh*t already. I see how it's eating you up. I know I can't ask of you to leave your heart at work every day and not take any of it home with you. But you have so much left to live. I don't want you to end up like the people I see at work. I need you to promise me that whenever it gets too heavy and whenever it suffocates you, you'll say it. We can't understand what you've seen, heard and felt that day, but we can understand that it's weighing on you. And I hope that in showing you the kindness you're unable to show yourself at that moment, we can relieve you of some weight."" The only people in my family that I told about my PTSD diagnosis are my dad and my partner. I never needed to tell my uncle, because he knew before I knew. All three of them have walked every step of the way with me.

And I hope you have someone who shows you kindness whenever you're unable to do so in your life too. ❤️"	AnimeDreama	reply	na	na	na	0.9935471415519714	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
" OP, it's called *vicarious trauma*, and PTSD is a predictable result.

I'm going to post this right now, but will also post a reply to this comment, to share my own story concerning bleeding and death.  

Freezing is a NORMAL HUMAN PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE, every bit as much as fight/flight are.  IOW, your BODY is (read: hormones are) ""in charge"" of how you react.

"Oh, hun. I’m so sorry you’ve had to experience an event like this.   
It’s natural to feel responsible, and to ask yourself what you could’ve done to prevent it, but in reality - these things sometimes *just happen*. You have the heart for this field, and you’re in the right place. It says a lot about you as a person that you feel sorrow for this patient & are hurting over the situation. You can only do the best that you can do, with what you know in the moment. You thought you were providing the appropriate treatment for the condition he was believed to have - that’s all any of us can ask of our medical providers.  
I’m not a medical professional, but I’ve been there. Back when I was 19 years old, I once had an immediate family member in the hospital following a stroke that was believed to be ischemic, based on the MRI results. I was the only available family member to make medical decisions on her behalf, as she was unable to make them for herself. The medical staff explained the risks of administering tPa, and the possible risks of not administering tPa. It has to be done very quickly if it’s going to help. I decided to go forward with the tPa. Turns out the stroke was hemorrhagic, not ischemic. The scans were either misread, or had taken place too early to note the hemorrhage (she was at work across the street from the hospital when she had the stroke, so she was in the MRI machine within like 20 minutes of the onset of symptoms.)  
As you can probably imagine, a clot busting drug on a hemorrhaging brain didn’t go well. She didn’t make it. We knew it was a possibility, but it was really hard on her medical team. I could tell they were trying to remain stoic and professional, but it was very clear that this was heavy and difficult for these nurses & doctors. I lost a family member, sure, but these folks simply went to work, and witnessed a death. I’ll only have to experience losing someone a limited number of times, if you consider how many relatives & friends as I have. You medical personnel have to lose friends and family just like I do, PLUS possibly losing patients.  
My family member was already in poor health. Her doctor didn’t put cigarettes in her mouth every day for 40 years - she did. The patient you lost was already clearly unwell. It may not make it any easier on you, but with the way you’ve explained the series of events, I don’t think a different nurse could’ve provided a different outcome for him. Everyone’s going to go eventually. My family member went pretty quickly. Your patient went pretty quickly. If I had to choose, I think that’s what I’d choose, too. Like another comment basically said, even if you’d have somehow been able to prevent his passing in that very moment, you would’ve only been prolonging the inevitable. It’s pretty unlikely that he would’ve come back from that situation regardless of how quickly you reacted, and even if he did, I highly doubt he would’ve had anything close to quality of life.   
I’m sorry you’re aching. I hope the professional help you’re seeking brings you comfort. Like the rest of us, you’re a human being. You didn’t do anything wrong. You did the absolute best you could do for him, with what information you had, moment by moment. You did a great job in a difficult situation, and you’re clearly compassionate. I could only hope that I had a nurse like you if I were in need of help."	AnimeDreama	reply	na	na	na	0.9935471415519714	strong	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"Definitely sounds like PTSD. Reach out to your boss or a trusted coworker and get in contact with your workplace’s employee support resources. Make an appointment with your primary doctor and get referred to a psychiatrist for therapy and maybe medications.

You did everything you could. It’s not your fault. You could not have saved him no matter what you did, it is not your fault. You did everything right and you were there in his last moments so he knew you were by his side and he was not alone.

I want you to know that you did the best that you could in the situation, please give yourself some grace. Sometimes life doesn’t make sense and our best efforts still don’t seem like enough. That was a very scary situation and no one should put any blame on you about how it ended up.

First of all, I am so sorry you had such a traumatic experience. Secondary Trauma is real. Benzodiazepines will help your nervous system for a eeek or two. I would highly recommend the book Trauma Stewardship. It really illuminated for me why I was feeling so strung out. It also offers soothing practices. Right now it’s like you’ve been hit by a tru.

Yes I am an MD and as I read your story I noted that his symptoms were not unlike a PE especially with his history of previous clots. I can see why the blood thinner was given; perhaps other tests were done that the staff hadn’t got the results of yet. Cardiac tamponade is not terribly common outside of blunt injury or certain chronic disease. Things certainly could have turned out better but remember: emergency situations are unpredictable and some of them deteriorate quickly and in a devastating manner. It is ultimately the practice of medicine and we are human; we go into our jobs with the best of intentions and using our very best knowledge and skills - sometimes it is not enough sadly. You and other staff cannot blame yourselves, further reflection and study of the confusion between these 2 conditions should be contemplated but medicine in an emergency situation is a fine line of patient presentation & history, instinct and racing against the clock. It’s not easy; hence our years of study and sacrifice to participate in this field. This young man’s death is a tragedy but you and your colleagues went into work that day with the best of intentions and did your best with the knowledge you had available at the time, to help your patient. I think almost all first responders and healthcare staff have memories of traumatic situations (whether we could have changed things or not) that will forever haunt us but that is part of choosing to be a human in difficult and sometimes impossible situations. We have to be kind and forgiving to ourselves when a horrible situation occurs despite your best efforts.	AnimeDreama	reply	na	na	na	0.9935471415519714	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"My own story:

**TW, along the same lines as OP's post**

My violent dad was also a primary source of my trauma during childhood, but that's a story for another time.  My mom enabled him, and this story occurs before I came out of denial about it all, in my early thirties.

Dad had a very high risk heart surgery performed by a surgeon hundreds of miles away, because no other surgeon would.  All this surgeon did was high-risk, and he had two hospital floors dedicated to his work and patients.

This surgeon:  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Dudley_Johnson

The surgery took > 12 hours, and it wasn't safe for dad to come out of his medically-induced coma for about two months.  Mom and I drove between home and the hospital, splitting the time being home and being in Milwaukee.  She was an RN at a ""sister"" hospital, but they wouldn't give her an LOA, and we needed the money, anyway.  My much lower-paying job told me to take all the time I needed.  The Milwaukee hospital/surgeon charity arranged free room and board, a standard long-term practice for the surgeon.  I was the one at the hospital most of the time, and can now tell anyone all about ""lake-effect"" snow.  *omg, it's a bone-chilling type of cold, a damp cold.*

FINALLY the day came when dad could move to from the SICU floor to the doc's medical floor.  He was slowly ""waking up,"" completely unaware of how long he had been there, and very confused.

It was late afternoon, and mom happened to be on her way.  I talked to her, told her how good dad was doing, how he was becoming more aware and responsive.  A multi-doctor meeting had been scheduled with us for the next day, because we wanted dad home, but the doctors were saying it was too soon.

His favorite nurse, we'll cal him ""A"" came in with a 3 CC syringe, about half full, with a bolus of warfarin.  Remember, mom's an active NICU RN, and I'd been watching these procedures for *months*.  I told ""A"" that it didn't look right, that it looked too ""swirly.""  It looked like it hadn't been cut with saline at all.  It looked like vodka or something.  I argued with him, and he kept talking to me like I didn't understand the word ""bolus.""

I didn't want to get kicked out, and he injected an IV line.  Within minutes, dad was bleeding from every opening in his body.  Every natural orifice (eyes, ears, nose), plus all of the various wounds and puncture sites.  His saphenous vein had been removed and used to repair his heart, via a leg-long incision that had been having trouble closing (no sutures > swelling from meds).    

I yelled for help, grabbing towels, sheets, blankets to try to stem it and sop it up.  I was kicked out of the room, and they managed to stem the flow.  Mom arrived, couldn't go in the room, either.  She was shocked, saying ""I thought you said he was doing better!""  I explained.

They flew dad home the next day (medical transport), without a quibble.  Imagine that.  I think they wanted us out of there, and didn't want to raise any additional ire.

Dad is admitted to the ""sister"" hospital where mom works, not too far from home, where he remains for another month.  Again, mom and I never left him alone.

After all, she knows all about medical errors.

He survived for two years following the surgery, and had six good, fully conscious months in the middle of that.  The remainder of the time was foggy and painful for him.  He was an autodidact, a life-long learner, and life lost purpose for him.  We tried to read to him, but he ...wasn't processing it.  He lost kidney function due to all the drugs + diabetes, so was on hemodialysis, which was the end of him - sepsis.

Many trips to the OR, and the day came when they had to admit him, his mind nearly gone.  The docs said there was nothing more they could do, and do we want them to continue to try, or put him on palliative care only.  Mom and I had already discussed it, and he was suffering too much.

So he was fed when he was able to eat, taken off dialysis and drugs, medicated for pain.  He was a large man, but so very weak.  His strength returned to abusively shout at me, much like he did when I was 12.  I felt only sorrow for him, because in his illness, he had become so much gentler, even acknowledging and lamenting some of his past wrongs.

A nurse came in to suction him, mom and I were both there, and we helped to restrain him as she pushed the hard, plastic tube into his throat.  It was so easy for us to each hold down a wrist as he struggled against us.  His eyes went wide, he stopped breathing, the nurse withdrew the tube.  He wasn't breathing, and he was DNR. It was over.

The nurse started to return the tube to it's holder, then said in a low, shocked voice, ""It wasn't on.""  Mom and I looked, and the suction had not been on.  IOW, mom and I had restrained dad while the nurse had asphyxiated him.

After all I had done to help him survive, I had just helped to kill my father.

For months, I had nightmares where dad said to me, ""You gagged me.""  His expressions, in the nightmares, was from sad, to shocked to angry, full of rage.  I was plagued.  Over the years, the nightmares have disappeared.  Typing all this out, I feel a little fear about dropping off tonight.  

OP, keep telling your story, keep sharing it.  Medical mistakes are because we're human.  Like me, you don't even have to be ""a pro"" for them to happen.  Why didn't I notice the suction wasn't on?!  Because like everyone else, I'm human.

The military and other organizations have situations they describe as having ""a zero tolerance for error.""  *Maybe you've heard of it, but if not, Google can show you.*

It's not humanly possible.  It's not even possible with anything that humans create, like meds, machines, computers, buildings, processes. It's definitely not possible within human bodies.

Errors will happen.  We will be traumatized, and it's possible to heal from that trauma, but part of healing is in the acceptance that it will never be possible to eliminate human error.

Me, my NICU mom and another nurse killed my dad with a medical error.  My mom is gone, but I still worry about the other nurse's suffering.  I hope she sought help.  I hope her nightmares are over.  I hope, from the depths of my heart, that she's okay now.

I believe you can get there, too.  Yes, a man died, but ""we"" is *not* really *you*, is it?  A doctor prescribed the thinners, and did so with the best of intentions, the standard of treatment that he was taught.  Nurses were taught to follow his instructions.  Had the nurses pulled the standard of care on the diagnosis, it would have listed the thinner.  An entire team of people did not foresee the med as a ""medical error.""  Not even the medical literature advised against the treatment he was rendered.  

Patients are going to die, and some of those deaths will be due to following the standard of care, the prescribed treatment.  It could have been a novel allergic reaction or any other unwanted reaction.    

Your unit manager should have held an inservice for this incident, and offered counseling for any who were willing.  Is there a ""care team"" for vicarious trauma in your facility?  Maybe asking any resident clergy could direct you to any available assistance?  Taking care of our medical people's trauma should not be an option, but a requirement.

I'm sure that you're not the only one suffering from the incident.  Have you reached out to any of your peers or your manager?  

In any case, please don't go through this alone, even if you need to seek help privately.  Also need to say, PTSD is very distracting, so be careful to look where you're driving or walking, and with any sharp instruments you handle.  Distraction causes accidents, so please make special efforts to remain aware while in motion.  

Please be gentle and loving with yourself.  I wish you peace and healing."	AnimeDreama	reply	na	na	na	0.9935471415519714	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"I don’t know the psychological basis that makes EMDR work (I just know that it’s fab for PTSD). 

I do know that the reason Tetris works is that it uses the exact same functions of your brain (repeated memories, and visual cues) that PTSD needs to “take root”. So essentially, playing Tetris in the first few days after a major trauma works by keeping the bits of your brain that make PTSD kick in, keeping them distracted so that the PTSD can’t embed itself. It’s “stealing” those brainwaves and neurons away so that the mechanism that allows PTSD to take hold can’t."	AnimeDreama	reply	na	na	na	0.9935471415519714	no	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"Hey guys
So I just wondered if anyone thinks this is part of coping post PTSD.

So life has been bad really since 2018. My wife nearly died in childbirth and I managed her airways at the head of the bed whilst it happened whilst help arrived, immediately after this, a month later, I held my nan as she died, a few weeks later the same with my cat dying. I then took a year out of study and went back in to healthcare just as COVID broke. My business was closed for COVID but I then had a whistle blowing event where it took me 6 months to have my record expunged and the people who had tried to bully me over how they handled (lol) covid were fired/fined. I then had to finish my studies at that place and had to work for free for 60hrs a week whilst trying to get my business back up. I had another child although this was very healing. I qualified the end of 2021 and having gone through COVID in the health service I went to work away 4 days a week as I couldn't work in that place because I had kids and couldn't commit apparently. So I had to be away from my family but for 2 days and was exhausted. In the new place of work I was stressed due to the hostile nature of the relationships within the unit to everyone from everyone despite managing to keep out of it. Then a patient committed suicide in front of me and I had an acute stress reaction and PTSD. This largely resulted over a 9 month period but after leaving for a quieter life in general practice I lasted about 5 months before they got rid of me 4 weeks before my probation ended largely because they didn't realise the role I provided and hadn't set it up right. As a result I'd struggled the entire period and had already decided to leave. The problem was they were very malicious about it and I had to clear my name first before slaving which I grossly achieved.

This however seemed to be the straw that broke me. I have had 3 months off a slight relapse in my PTSD and anxiety which I seem to have come out of largely. I have manifested alot of positive energy and underwent EMDR and nightly sleep hypnosis and CBT and meditation and want to leave it all behind.

Sorry for the long intro. Now however, I often draw a blank when people reference anything that happened in that time. They will start talking about something funny that happened or meeting my kids etc or a holiday that happened in that time and I'm literally like I forgot that happened. When my wife prompts me the memory comes back but I feel sluggish, mentally tired and work down. I feel like my memories are there but it's like they're blurred. I can access them but the whole time period feels like I was in fight or flight and the world moved so fast between events that I was just passing through the good stuff. 

I used to have a near eidetic memory and this is scaring me slightly. I'm catastrophising about it and just wonder if I need to be worried or whether I just need to continue my path of positivity and let it ride itself out.

I do however respect the fact that I think I've burned out when I lost my last job. I have now got my dream job and am thriving there. It feels like I'm coming out of a haze.

"I completely understand, it’s such a terrifying feeling! The good news is there are only 2 parts of the brain that have regenerative properties, the olfactory bulb, and the hippocampus. Ptsd is visible in a brain scan, but so is healing. A ptsd brain can actually look & feel completely normal again after one goes through the healing process. Unfortunately there’s no shortcut or supplement you can take. Frankly supplements are not regulated at all and can do more harm than good. You just never know if what’s in the pills is what they say it is, or is in the dosage they say it is. 

Unfortunately it takes years of counseling to heal. EMDR is popular especially for ptsd. Anti anxiety meds can help and they have some regenerative properties too but they don’t work for everyone (they made me really tired). Exercise is probably the 2nd best thing you can do in addition to counseling since it improves blood flow to the area & thus speeds up the brains natural healing abilities (also confirmed with neuroscience studies & brain scans).

"Can you see if there are any online therapists that will take medicaid?   


At the very least when I asked on 7 cups of tea if they could reduce the rate they were able to reduce it to $50 a month... which I know is not great but it was something.

You could also contact the therapists on give an hour and see if any of them can provide some free sessions. It is an organization the provides free therapy to people, and you can find someone who does over the phone.   


I am so sorry, I hope he finds some peace! I also would feel like I was dying after being attacked. But I did not sustain bodily harm, it was not the same...

"TW: slightly talking about a SA experience. 
Talk about consensual sex
Boyfriend not understanding PTSD
d**sociation talk (i add this because this word can trigger me sometimes, adding for those who don’t want to see that word)

Today I asked my bf why we don’t have sx lately. My boyfriend then said he’s worried about a scar I have down there and he asked me what this scar tissue is from, which i told him before but i guess he forgot. and I told him “I don’t want to talk about it right now..”
he said “No you have to tell me so I know that you’re okay and why it’s like that…” 
I got upset, because it is scar tissue from SA. I told him “I’m okay, It was just something bad someone did to me and I don’t want to talk about it right now because I won’t be okay”
and he kept pushing and said please tell me, i’m here for you, it’s okay. 
So I told him, “Someone put something there when I was little and it really hurt me so now it’s scarred. It’s okay now, it doesn’t hurt it’s just a scar.” 
and he NAMED the person asking if it was them. Which triggered me more. I said “Yes.” and he said “What did he put” and I said “I don’t remember it was just an item and I don’t wanna talk about it anymore.”
And he said “Just tell me I’m here for you” 
and I said “Stop!!!! I don’t wanna talk about it!!! I’m triggered now and I’m dissociating please”
and he started trying to cuddle me and hug me and I was dissociating thinking of my trauma so i didn’t want him to touch me in that moment. He got upset and said “But i am sad I need cuddles” and I said “YOURE sad? after you just made me talk about MY trauma when I said I didn’t want to… This is about me right now and this is serious I need to do my own thing because I’m not okay right now.” and he kept still trying to force me to cuddle. 
I told him to leave the room and leave me by myself so I could process. And because he was making things worse. 
He finally left the room, but i’m so upset he doesn’t understand how to help me. It’s simple, just follow my lead and listen to what i’m saying and let me do my thing ….
Please help me

"Dump him. The only way some people will learn not to fuck with boundaries is to be permanently locked out of your life. Defense your boundary and be the one show him that you never fuck with someone like that. Dump him, leave, and never look back. 

One’s own selfish security in knowing something so that they can ‘protect’ their partner is never an acceptable reason to break a boundary. He should’ve listened the first time you held your ground. And he chose to seek knowledge and push you at the expense of your well-being and boundaries. 

What I tell myself is that the moment someone willingly crosses my boundaries is the moment they chose to end our friendship/relationship. I’m a man of principles. And I know that anyone who violates these reasonable principles is destructive and I cannot have them in my life. So I must accept that they chose to never be in my life anymore. And I must follow through with their decision by giving them what they rightfully deserve as a result of violation of my boundary. It’s simple cause and effect really. It’s just the consequences of their actions.

As heartbreaking as it may be, he chose to end your relationship in that moment not you. If you’re willing to stick to your boundaries and principles. By giving anyone like that another chance, you are enabling their behavior and reinforcing the fact that they think they can get away with such selfishness and that it’s a reconcilable offense."	666roses	reply	na	na	na	0.9980813264846802	no	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"No one has any right to information about your trauma, and it can be further trauma for them to decide to play detective and demand the specifics.  It's the most inappropriate thing I can think of in this situation for someone to do this, regardless of you telling him multiple times that you were not okay, and then demand to be comforted.  You were completely in the right here, and he was completely in the wrong.  I am so sorry that it was done to you, and I'm so sorry that he showed you such disrespect and such disregard for your feelings.  I don't know what the future of that relationship is (I am aro ace, but if it were me in your place, I would have a hard time with the only possible future of the relationship being ""GTFO"".), but I would highly suggest that you confront him about it either in person or in a letter if you can't or don't want to say it out loud.  Make sure he knows what he did wrong, why it was wrong, what he should have done (which is ask if you felt safe talking about it, confirm that he was not hurting you, and then tell you that he was here if you wanted to talk about it, and then shut the fuck up), and what you need him to say and do to make you feel safe with him again.  I'm hoping that he's very young and just doesn't know how to handle the situation and doesn't know how horrible he was and isn't just that selfish and self centered.    


I suggest getting him some links online to look at.  When I told my mother I had been SAed as a child, she immediately went into detective mode, and I ran out of the room.  I sent her a link on Youtube that was titled, ""What to do when someone you care about tells you they were molested"" or something similar.  There are actually a few that are very good.  She was very understanding after watching it, apologized, and just let me tell her things as she I was ready after that.  She was always upset that I did not tell her who had done it (There were two people, and I told her the person she didn't know but never told her the person she did know.), but she understood that it was my choice and needed to be something I was comfortable with.    


A lot of people feel entitled to your story, if they find out that you have PTSD.  I have CPTSD, due to multiple incidents, and a lot of people, even strangers, feel like they have the right to ask me twenty questions when they find out.  I have to tell people a little bit sometimes, like ""I need to know if the TV show we're going to watch has any animal abuse/ death in it, because of my PTSD."".  I have a lot of friends that just say, ""Okay"" and tell me warnings for what we watch or what they recommend, but occasionally you get the person who wants to hear the story and gets mad if I won't tell them, because ""I brought it up."".  Clearly I brought it up for an important reason, and it wasn't to be questioned.  I have to remind them that this is about my trauma, and my comfort with my trauma is always more important than their curiosity about the details.  If they cannot respect that, then I know that that is a person I don't need to spend more time with, because it is only going to get more intrusive and less respectful from there."	666roses	reply	na	na	na	0.9980813264846802	weak	no	no	na	ptsd	'no prediction.'

So I’m going to be completely transparent and hopefully y’all can see my honesty and not judge me. I’m pretty mean to my fiancé and people around me when things happen or when something goes wrong and I think it stems from my father being emotionally unavailable and not teaching me how to identify and regulate emotions. For instance I often snap at my fiancé when she gives me wrong directions and say things like “oh my god youre supposed to tell me the directions before I’m right next to the exit” or “please just look at the phone and give me directions” in a very snappy tone and I catch myself doing it and lately I’ve been at least apologizing at the end and telling her I’m working really hard and I’ve done my best not to snap lately. I also snap a lot when I feel like I’m not being heard or I feel as if I’m picking up the slack she is leaving with things like chores and eventually I’ll just blow up about how I do everything in the house and I say really aggressive things to her and I feel terrible at the end because I wasn’t even angry I was just upset and really kind of sad that it felt like I wasn’t being heard. I also tend to get angry a lot when I’m actually just sad and I’ll often times end up bursting into anger and then crying my eyes out and being confused why I’m crying if I’m angry but turns out I’m not angry I’m sad and I’ve built it up and up until I explode and come to think of it that’s a lot of the reason I feel anger all the time is because as a child I was Taught the whole “men don’t feel emotions except anger” and my father modeled that a lot and it’s rubbed off on to me and idk I need an opinion	Bonsaitalk	post	7.144641660033585	female	White	0.007018876727670431	na	na	na	1	ptsd	no prediction.

Nevermind the nightmares, not only do those haunt me, it's hard to fall asleep in the first place. Just as I do, I start hearing voices, my hands or feet twitch. Yesterday it was worse. I was so exhausted, I kept trying to sleep but just as I do I get some sort of rush to wake up fast and get up. Or some parts of me like my stomach starts tensing up or I get tics. It feels like, if I close my eyes and completely relax, someone is going to come and start kicking or beating me. Even though I know its not true. I just wanna know if anyone else has this. I know working out can help with it but even when I do these stress relieving things, I can never completely relax.

"I was at a store with my mom and we ran into a couple that lives in my building 
I know the lady really well but i dont know her husband at all

He randomly shook my hand and mmmm i dont know how to explain it
I just i wanted to throw my hand away after..
Nothing against him i guess
It mightve been because he was a man? Maybe?
I just i never realized how much i reallly fucken hate it when people i dont know touch me 

Even just shaking my hand makes me want to have a panic attack

I felt so weird and uncomfortable after
I absolutely hated it
It made me feel gross 

I ended up buying some stuff for myself to make myself feel better but god i hated that interaction..
I know its something most people can do just fine but i just i hate it.. 


Ive always sorta hated it when people do that but i guess ptsd just added a fun panic attack and the lingering feeling of dread to it 🐌🌱

I get disgusted specifically at certain mens hands. Idk but something about a guys hands gives me a certain vibe about them. Its just specifically men with larger thumbs and larger nail beds, with sort of crooked fingers. I absolutely cannot stand prople with hands like that.

"Hugs and handshakes (with people I don't know really well and trust 1oo%) give me anxiety too and so I've started saying no. I apologize and offer fist bumps or elbow high-fives. If they don't like it, that's their problem, not mine and I've also stopped feeling bad about it. 

I used to just submit to hugs or handshakes and feel horrible afterwards and I've had enough. People also tend to grab and squeeze me really hard because I'm tiny and it hurts and I've been hurt physically, so there's that too. No hugs. I hate hugs. I don't get why people want to press their bodies against each other and squeeze. No thanks. It's taken some practice, but now it's my normal.

"TLDR: Growing up was hell. Got outta Dodge asap. Now that I’m in therapy do I really want to communicate with my family?

This isn’t really a vent, I think.  It I think I had to add flair, so I picked Venting.

Middle-aged female. Dx’d years ago with depression and anxiety. Been on meds ever since, which keep getting stronger. Been looking for a good therapist, and my psychiatrist recommended one to me, and we clicked. Several sessions, lots of background, and I was diagnosed with PTSD due to prolonged childhood trauma. 

I grew up in a very nuclear family, the elder of 2 sisters. Dad was emotionally and physically abused as a child. Mom had a normal childhood. They married young, and I was born in the first year. We were poor, and we moved where the jobs were and so parents could go to school. Moved 17 times in 16 years. Went to 9 schools. Started caring for younger sis when I was 8/9, and started caring for the house as parents were so busy when I was 11.  

Dad is severely OCD and used to have a real temper. I took the brunt of his anger to protect mom and because I “should have known better” (was told this many times). Sister was very sickly in childhood, so I was the object of that angst too. Was punished physically when I misbehaved. I don’t know what is excessive, but I think it was normal? School was hell. Was bullied throughout, most severely between ages 11 and 14. Lots of it was physical.

Dad turned a new leaf emotionally when I was 17/18. After that, life got a lot better, but was always on pins and needles. I moved across the country as soon as I graduated college. First 5 years of that were hard, but I’ve settled in. Married for 30 years with 3 children. 

Since i moved around so much as a child, my social skills are weak. I am great socially but have no meaningful friendships. On my guard all the time. Terrified of my own anger. And more.

When I started therapy I attributed my worst years as those between ages 11 and 14. I’m now realizing it was birth till I moved away. I look at my parents differently as well as my sister. I don’t know what to think anymore! Do I love them? Do I resent them? Do I hate them? I still feel inferior to them and and crave love and acceptance from them. I’m always on my best behavior around them (about 5 days a year). How will therapy change my relationship with them?"

"I've worked in mental health now for ~15 years and for the last five I've worked with children who've been removed from their homes due to abuse. My elevator pitch for what we do is ""we're where the kids from Law & Order: SVU go."" 

It involves seeing and dealing with situations that I've seen literal adults just not be able to process. It's a consistent problem with new people - they see things that they thought only happened in stories. 

I'd been handling things pretty alright up until about a year and a half to two years ago. I was able to look at the work we were doing as an org and it was something I could reliably touch on as a way to make myself feel better about seeing these things and that worked pretty well. Yes, ideally I should have had more help but I wasn't drowning.

Then we had a wide range of changes to the company, state laws, and just how we do things and it destroyed our ability to do work that felt meaningful and impactful. We're not seeing progress and everyone is demoralized.

Right now, I'm drowning. I took the STS scale (Secondary Trauma Syndrome) which measures a person's rough ""level"" of secondary PTSD. Above a 49 is considered ""Extreme STS."" I scored a 65. I'm shaking when I come home from work, I can barely sleep but I never feel tired, I'm irritable, my memory is shot, I have no appetite, and my startle response is through the roof.

I'm leaving this job very soon (within the next month or so) and I am seeing a therapist though progress there is a bit slow because there's not a ton of information on secondary PTSD and a lot of the typical coping strategies haven't been working out for me. 

I'd leave this job right now if I could but financially there's no way I can.

I guess I'm asking for feedback as to how people have handled secondary PTSD in the past and for as long as I've worked in mental health I guess I don't understand what it means to actually process trauma. What does that look like? What does that feel like?

I keep hearing ""you need to process this, talk to someone."" Ok...I'm doing that and I don't feel any different. I know part of it is proximity, I'm still in this situation and there's nothing I can do about that for the moment. But none of the techniques I'm reading about really make me feel that much different."	HeloRising	post	34.13666841031395	male	White	0.9975354671478271	na	na	na	1	ptsd	failed

"I'm currently up at 3am. I don't know how PTSD is, but I've taken care of my grandmother who has had multiple fractures in her spine and has seizures. The first time I saw it, I freaked out and thought she was dying. Her bones are very frail and the doctors say they're at the point where they're as fragile as glass.

Everytime she yawns, I think she's making the noise she normally makes for a seizure. Sometimes I think I hear her, but she really didn't make any noise. I have nightmares 4 days a week. Not always about her, but when they are it terrifies me bcs it's always her contorting. I don't know if I'm having these nightmares bcs of an average of 5 hours a sleep a day or if it's bcs visually those seizures traumatized me. 

I try to suppress the imagery but everytime she has another seizure, the imagery after is hard to get rid of. One time I went behind her bcs she was hunched strangely, and she started twisting her neck to face me screaming bcs of a seizure. I Hate this feeling, it's terrifying. I want it to stop.

"Some 49 yrs ago (12yr)  I became pregnant with my then  brother in-laws( 27yr)  baby .
  My parents would take me to my sister's house and said go help her with the kids age 4 & NB & dothe  house work . 
   My BIL started seeing me as the wife and my sister as just a lazy uncaring mom . So, the romance began it was 2 years later that I became pregnant with his baby . We kept everything to ourselves and never told a single person who the dad was not even my parents . At 7mo along my mom thought I looked pregnant . Thank God because  I had no idea what was going to happen !  I went to an unwed mothers home . 
   My baby was immediately  placed for adoption .
 A few months later we ran off together   . 
  Thing is that I'm still with him to this very day . We split for a few yrs but coparented out 2 sons &  Since remarried. 
 He has 2 kids from my sister who are in contact with us . 
  My major meltdown , plunge to back to the depths  is that his daughter is living with us . She is just like her mom a  lazy,  lazy person . 
   She didn't even offer her 72yr old dad a glass of water as he was working in 90o weather trying to ready our camper for her to stay in  ! No joking she goes from bed to br , to kitchen and eats 4 sausages 3 eggs and lord knows how much bread . She sits there for several  hours until she goes to the couch or front porch . She don't drive so she is always here !! 
  
  We have 2 grandsons( 11yrs old twins ) that I have cared for  over the last 11yrs .  Told one  grandson he needed to go back to his daddy's & made him cry !! 😢 I can be a mean mamma bear ! 
   Space is tight and the kids need their beds back school starts soon .  
         We only have 2bd & 2ba home 
    I don't want to hate her but it's almost to late . 
 She has never offered up a dime for  food, toiletries,  washing powders ect and in 2mo cooked 1 meal . 
    He thinks I'm the 1 acting unreasonable  when I state I just can't take her anymore.  
  It's like my parents dropped my sister at My home & said take care of her every need ! 
 Those same thoughts of life is just too damn hard for me to handle are back again ! I'm 59 and just tired  ! 
 Hubby don't seem to get it and thinks I'm over reacting ! I agree somewhat becuse I've not had this amount of anger towards anyone in a very long time .
 I don't do therapy because I'm always told to leave him . See above I'm too tired to go anywhere and would never give up what I have worked hard for . 
    Set me back many yrs already ! 
  I'm hoping that venting helps because not many understand my circumstances."	Grits64	post	36.69193425538525	female	White	0.9989161491394043	na	na	na	3	ptsd	failed

"I was reading about trauma, specifically with SA, but felt it probably related to most people with PTSD from abuse. It was saying “they may assess unsafe situations as safe and perceive safe situations as dangerous,” and I was wondering why? I get why we might be hypervigilant and lack trust for anyone, but why does it seem that after you are abused somehow you learn to feel safe in abuse and unsafe in real love or support? I know why things would seem overwhelming and scary, but why would familiar abuse not faze you when you know that’s what hurts you? Then, why would an actual safe or even positive thing scare you so much if you would be unfazed should it turn into an unsafe/dangerous situation? Because if actual unsafe and dangerous situations don’t bother you then I feel like it would be more logical to have the mindset during a safe/positive situation that you don’t have anything to lose if you have learned to be okay with abuse or trauma. But somehow sometimes for people safe and positive situations can be the scariest thing. 

I don’t know if this is making sense, but I was curious what other people thought. Is it just simply that something in our brains has become flipped flopped?"	bubbles244434	post	26.274355354635247	female	White	0.9935873746871948	na	na	na	9	ptsd	failed

I can completely relate. The trauma I experienced completely fractured my soul. I feel at ease in crisis situations, but panic when there’s calm. Maybe it’s be because if there’s a crisis I know what it is and can focus on working in that, and the crisis is presumably outside of my self and thus easier to process. But when it’s calm, when I’m alone with my own thoughts? I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop & anticipate the worst possible scenario.	bubbles244434	reply	na	na	na	0.9935873746871948	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

"It's so hard for me that my wit, my ability to connect things in the moment to basically tell a story while having fun... wait i find it hard to find the words for that.

You know when you're playing a boardgame with friends and you tease each other based on what happened earlier in the game? I can't seem to do that. I also don't care about being in the moment and having fun enough in order to say funny things, but at the same time that's what i really want. Being able to do it would require me to remember what happened and to care about it enough. It seems like i just need a lot of rest.

This post is very spontaneous. Honestly it feels better that way than if i had planned it out.

Does anyone have any thoughts about cognitive dysfunction due to trauma in general? I know i need to work on accepting myself, but at the same time i don't wanna give this moment. Maybe for the moment tho. Because it's not healthy for me.

It's like my entire personality is gone and bc i wanna have one i need to force it.

I felt the exact same way. I thought my entire personality had disappeared and I'd be boring and less intelligent forever. I was wrong. That person returned. The quick wit and flowery language returned, the fast shifting between tasks returned, it's all back. I went through an intense two weeks of full time treatment in 2021 and more regularly paced therapy after and I'm back. You're not gone, your brain just doesn't have the space right now.

"I’ve survived several different traumas, including throughout most if not all of my childhood. I won’t go into specifics. I always believed I came out unscathed and talked about them neutrally in passing during therapy, and never had super negative memories attached to them aside from general bitterness towards the people involved. 

A couple weeks ago I experienced an annual trigger, but it hasn’t done anything other than make me feel a bit sad for 1-3 days as I used healthy coping skills. But on the same day as the annual trigger, I experienced a new trigger that felt like it opened pandora’s box. I accidentally screamed at the person who triggered it, and shortly after apologized and explained why I reacted the way I did. He took it extremely well, apologized, and promised to never do it again. I thought that was the end.

Ever since then I’ve been experiencing extremely realistic nightmares, memories, and reliving flashbacks to three different traumatic events I thought were behind me. It’s been Years since any of them happened. I’ve been having extreme anxiety, panic attacks, and getting less and less sleep as time goes on. My work ethic is nonexistent so my job is suffering, my moods are unpredictable so my relationship is suffering, and I’m flipping between extremely wound up to burnt out so I’m absolutely suffering.

I see my therapist every other week, and he is all booked up until our next appointment. I tried to make an appointment with my primary, but she’s on vacation this week and the front desk said this topic is for my therapist. I’m scared to be in cars, have to talk myself into leaving my house, and got sent home one day after having a panic attack. 

What do I do? Where do I go? Do I just tough it out until my appointment? I’m terrified of losing my job and don’t want to keep hurting those around me

"TW: will be talking about drugs and medication. Nothing graphic but adding a warning for those who need it! 

This happened years ago but I still feel the negative impact from it today. I basically ate too much of an edible that happened to be laced (didn’t know it) and I suffered a horrible “trip”. I was fainting, freaking out, horrified and it led on for the entirety of the next day. I was severely underweight at the time so this affected my body in a more extreme way. 
I never really felt the same after that, my panic attacks became a nightmare and I felt like I was walking in a dream constantly. I soon realized that when I would take my sleep pills, pain medication, or adderall, I would be taken over by a massive panic attack. It hurts physically to be so scared and to be reminded of that feeling that I had that day. I couldnt even keep myself from freaking out when I had to be put under for surgery recently. Anything that alters my body chemically invokes panic. God forbid I need to take a benadryl, that was the pill I took that made me realize I couldn’t handle medication the same.
Ive spent all of these years gas lighting myself into thinking its not a big deal and I’m just overreacting. I don’t believe that I would still be too scared to take any medication if it wasn’t a “big deal”. I cant enjoy a simple alcoholic beverage or even a tea if it makes me feel any sort of way. Even if I havent had enough for it to affect me I still begin to feel sick. 
I dont even know if this is truly PTSD, I just dont know where else to post this. I dont have anyone to discuss this with and unfortunately cannot afford a doctor/therapist for possible help. Writing it out does help in some way at least."	FilthyFoul	post	32.41369438292162	female	White	0.9956048727035522	na	na	na	1	ptsd	no prediction.

I worked until 11 AM this morning at the apartment complex I lived as a groundskeeper. I submitted my letter of resignation four months ago after a friend died on Thanksgiving in the same city.

"i know you guys aren’t doctors, just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and gotten any ideas about what it is. i posted to a couple med subs but haven’t gotten any responses. 

i’m 23f, i’m diagnosed with PTSD/MDD/BPD

for as long as i can remember, i’ve had this weird thing where i’m super sensitive to other people touching me and i feel pain when they do. for example, someone can lightly grab my arm to lead me in a crowd and i feel pain under their fingertips. if my boyfriend pokes me anywhere i feel pain. when my cat stands on my leg it genuinely hurts me. it’s not a sharp shooting pain, more achey. it feels exactly like poking a bruise. 

i’ve always told other people about it if they touch me too “rough” and they ALWAYS think im being dramatic because of how light the actual contact was. it’s hard to explain something that does not make sense to other people. 

i’ve looked this up so many times and im always led to hyperalgesia but it doesn’t quite fit my experience. i am heavily tattooed and i have lots of piercings all over my body and i believe that i sit pretty well for both. i can poke myself pretty hard and not experience the pain that i do if someone else were to do it. i can stub my toe and i don’t believe it’s any more painful than anyone else’s stubbed toe. i’m heavily leaning towards this being something going on in my brain/related to PTSD because it seems to only be a problem with other people or when i’m not fully aware of the pain i’m going to be feeling (like a tattoo). 

any experience with this?"	lizardandlark	post	19.913597672212713	female	White	0.014442856423556805	na	na	na	16	ptsd	no prediction.

you could have sensory issues due to PTSD, you can probably train yourself to feel less pain from things that aren’t painful by slowly re introducing yourself to different thinks like pokes and other things, for example have ur bf poke you (under your control) and breathe through it, remind yourself it’s under your control and you are safe and it’s okay, i hope this makes sense i didn’t explain super well	lizardandlark	reply	na	na	na	0.014442856423556805	no	no	no	na	ptsd	failed

"I had a stroke when I was a year old. I don't know much about the physical pain you feel. I'm really sorry you deal with this. I will sometimes feel what I think is a more than average pain from bumping into something on my left (stroke affected) side.

However, my first tattoo was a full-color half-sleeve on my left bicep, and the pain was hardly noticeable at all. Most of the needling felt like nothing but vibrations on my skin and it was one 4-ish hour outline and one 6 hour shading/coloring session. My second tattoo was on my right forearm in one 4 hour session, and the pain was noticeably more prevalent.

"I witnessed a close friend get murdered when I was 20 and living abroad in Europe.  At the time, I didn't know what PTSD was, and the mental breakdown that I had when I got back to the US came as a complete surprise.  I went through therapy initially, but I was misdiagnosed as bi-polar, given lithium (which turned me into a complete zombie, so I stopped) and docs thought ""job done"".  So I went with my own course of treatment, which included a lot of self-hypnosis, Taoist meditation, a litany of one-night stands and my own form of sound/music therapy.  

4 years later, I was killing it at work, no nightmares, barely thought about it, and I met an amazing woman who I helped through her own massive childhood trauma + DV situation with boyfriend + ADHD.  We got married a year later and now have 2 beautiful children.

Fast forward another 10 years, and at her prompting we have been exploring non-monogamy.  Me more for exploring a latent interest in BDSM and her for exploring full-blown polyamory.  While I am very much open to non-monogamy (and in fact, while she only has 1 other partner, I've slept with way more), the way that she has pursued polyamory - head over heels for an ex to the point of not being able to respect any of the agreements we make.  The sense of powerlessness that I have has more or less triggered all of my traumas - not just the PTSD, but also the trauma of family separation/abandonment I experienced as an 11-13 year old (mom went to live in another country for 2 years and I saw her once in that time, while my dad was the typical workaholic, emotionally numb African dad who was bottling up his own massive traumas from growing up under Apartheid).

I feel like I've been fooling myself all these years.  That what I thought was legitimate recovery and thriving was in fact just a very strong, elaborate mask that I created to survive and make money within the toxicity of the Silicon Valley tech world.  I feel the same numbness I felt as a teen, and that I felt as that 20 year old.  I feel like I can't show up for myself, my kids, my partners, my employees/investors/customers.  I already have a solo therapist, who is amazing, so I'm not really sure where to go from here.  I don't think I can do another 4 years like I did in my early 20s - and in any case, it doesn't seem like it was actual recovery. 

Where do I go from here?  I feel so lost."		post	28.874191549639807	female	White	0.9984114170074463	na	na	na	3	ptsd	failed

"I think the years that you managed well are valid. You put in the work and it helped you in life. I also think we are fragile in the area if our trauma and when other stressors are in play it makes it difficult for our brain to process it all. Trauma by it's very nature happens when our normal coping mechanisms fail to help us process.  

I think you have identified very well what it happening and how it all connects. This time you have a partner with her own thoughts and you can't control those, and yet you are impacted by them.  

Just don't be so hard on yourself. You can find your way again.  I don't know how you go back from the steps you have taken down the non monogamy path that put you were you are today but this has exposed your trauma and maybe it's time to freeze that for now and find your grounding again.

"I have an ACE score of 10, and I'm a daycare worker. I have ptsd, severe depression, severe anxiety, DIDNOS, and I'm on the autism spectrum somewhere, but you generally can't tell.

One of my kids fell from the playground equipment and his skull burst open. When that happened I instinctively covered his head and put pressure on the wound, *everything around me slowed down like in a movie* and I was able to point to my fellow teachers and give out orders to go get so-and-so for help, bandages, call 911, etc.

My coworkers (I don't know them well but it's likely they have less trauma than me) were a hot mess during it and scrambling. 

I was literally covered in blood and completely calm. 

They all needed to take breaks and calm themselves down, and I was just numb the rest of the day. Of course, I was worried about the child, but it didn't affect me like it should.

I ended up getting praised from admin, but I feel weird, like I'm less than human. I should feel more than nothingness.

"This is normal, and unless its causing you distress or problems, its OK to acknowledge that youre numb and not make too much out of it.

Theres no right or wrong way to respond, you helped, the kid is OK, what more could anyone ask for. Trauma changes how we react to circumstances like this for better or worse.

Sounds like you just got cut off from a hyper reaction, got serious as all hell and did the best and most responsible thing you could, like as if this is your way of protecting everyone from worse had nobody been able to respond appropriately.

Thats a fantastic response. When shit settles and you have some distance, your feelings might emerge and you might find yourself having a different reaction, but when you needed to be present and calm you were.

"I left a DV situation a bit over a year ago and in my stages of self reflection from that during the healing process I realize I've been SA as a teenager and realizing more now that there was more incidents as an adult as well. Since then I've had an extreme aversion towards physical touch/the idea of intimacy. I am fine with being touched in a medical or professional setting for the most part as I work in a physical therapy clinic currently but do a lot of other things medical wise since I'm in the military. However, I'm not able to date as I will have a visceral reaction to the guy getting too close and like I said I have an aversion towards even the idea of intimacy. My therapist wants to see me more before giving me an ""official"" diagnosis but he's confident I have PTSD from my experiences. I just don't think it's that serious. Like I wouldn't consider any of the SA rape but more  no being ignored and other types of unwanted sexual contact. And my symptoms don't have a daily impact on my life, I don't think. As long as guys don't approach me trying to touch me or anything I'm okay. I'm also extremely bitter of marriage and relationships, people starting a family idk. I would like to not be bitter but I'm not even sure how. 

I do struggle with other symptoms of PTSD like extreme irritability at times and seeing the type of truck my ex-husband drives gives me anxiety eventhough he lives in another state now. My therapist sent me to a MST support group (military sexual trauma). I went once and plan on going back and actually really liked it. Another thing they pointed out was that I have no sense of safety, but I thought my behavior/thoughts was normal especially for a few a woman. I walk my dogs daily and I'm constantly scanning for escape routes in case of an offleash dog or a man with bad intentions. Like if I can hop a fence if needed or what's the best building to run to if I'm in danger, will my dog be in a position to protect me from a man, or what to do if they take her out.Things like that ha. 

I'm not sure what the purpose of this post was. Maybe some form of validation? Most of the people I'm used to having PTSD are my friends and colleagues who've been to combat so I'm just not comfortable talking to them about it as I feel like they have more of a reason to have PTSD. I can't talk to anyone in my family about it. So I'm sort of struggling with the idea of me having it. I like the idea of being able to date again, find the right guy a years from now, but it's not even a possibility in the foreseeable future."	justneedanswerrz	post	33.155661020884466	female	White	0.9901974201202393	na	na	na	1	ptsd	failed

"Potential trigger warning within the first paragraph below.

Anyone else can’t sleep unless their bedroom door is a certain way?  My husband has recently decided that we need to have the door open at night and I can’t stop watching to make sure that no one is walking in now. I had been aggressively sexually assaulted in my first apartment a few years back and more recently I had a gun pulled at me at my most recent job (quit afterwards), so having the bedroom door closed makes me feel more secure and not having to observe the open doorway for danger from my bed like a hawk.  Doesn’t help that now my dog is wanting to roam around instead of helping me sleep by remaining close to me. 


I feel like he thinks I’m just crazy and overreacting…but I can’t shut that alarm part of my brain off with the door being open.  It’s keeping me wide awake and nervous.

So for the past 3 weeks I’ve been getting this extreme restless, crawl out of skin feeling especially when I look at my phone or any screens, or if I try and read anything. I have severe anxiety, panic disorder, ocd, and ptsd, thought I’d mention that if it may be relevant. I’ve been feeling this 24/7 for the past 3 weeks. Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? I can barely look at my phone or the tv or anything at all. It feels like everything is too much, I’m almost completely unable to concentrate on anything.

"I also struggle and no I'm not 100 percent healed... I do find though that since I have cut off my mom. I am able to be accountable for my own actions. Like in fights with my husband I use to just blame him for everything... Had a situation that kind of made me go  how can it always be him. I live with such shame and guilt that I ruminate what ifs all the time and assume the worst. Half the time our arguments were things I've already came up with in my head so when he gave a reaction that I felt confirmed the way I was feeling I'd lose my shit, could be external, where I'm now reflecting my anger on to him which then turns into a massive fight Or I internalize and feel like I'm the most useless disgusting person to man kind. And I always had this poor me mentality it's easier to blame everyone else.When I finally stopped associating with my mom I was able to clearly see where I was the problem and what I needed to fix and in turn even though I do slip up and fall back. This last year is the first year in my life that I feel safe and happy. (That in its self is a weird feeling. I am 29 and sent the last 28 years in chaos.. so silence can be intimidating) I do know I can change and it takes time and alot of work. I can't afford therapy.

So I have been having trouble dealing with my thoughts when alone in certain places. I am not sure what might be triggering so I’ll just avoid saying what it is but basically I can’t really do anything else. As a result, my thoughts have been overwhelming my mind a lot lately, and they have been getting fairly bad at times. I mentioned to my  therapist and she said time will slow them down( for me this has been true in the past so it is likely true for these ones), but in the mean time any advice to tolerate them. I can’t avoid this situation. I used to like this time but it has been getting progressively worse( maybe because I am away from my support group as I am back home for the summer) but regardless any advice would help		post	31.362442413543434	female	White	0.9969724416732788	na	na	na	2	ptsd	failed

1. Deep breathing, meditation, and grounding, especially in crisis situations

2. Saying I am not my thoughts over and over again (friend suggested this)

3. Acceptance and surrender to the thoughts, not fighting them or resisting them

I (30F) recently started casually dating, and I met this great guy (33M) via a dating app. When I was a teenager I was in a very abusive relationship for a few years, like SA and emotional, and it can make stuff like getting intimate challenging. I was diagnosed with PTSD at 24. I’ve done a lot of work in therapy (when I’ve been able to access it) and out, but healing is a weird process and I do still have triggers and dissociation and flashbacks. I got tired of my PTSD ruling my dating life and tried my best to let dates know what my boundaries were as clearly as possible. On our first date, I told him ahead of time that if he called me a nickname during activities I would have a panic attack. I also have panic attacks during activities sometimes and I told him if this happened he probably hasn’t done anything wrong, give me some water and I’ll need time to calm down, and may not be able to try again. He said okay. During things, he did not do anything wrong, but I did start to have a panic attack. He immediately stopped everything and gave me a glass of water (he even made one to put next to the bed just in case before we started) and helped me calm down. He even helped me with grounding. Eventually I calmed down and drove home, and I felt bad that yet again I couldn’t prevent it from happening. I wasn’t expecting him to want to see me again because if that happens, I usually just get ghosted (sucks but I also understand, it’s a lot). Fast forward, and we have kept seeing each other. Just about every time we do adult things, I have a panic attack. Sometimes I’m able to calm down and try again, sometimes I’m not. Today he asked me if there are things he can try and do before/during that will help keep me grounded so I don’t get to that place mentally. Like how could we work together to prevent me from ending up there before it happened, not just worry about after. And I realized no one has ever asked me that? It has always been on me to know what to do, to keep it as under control as possible, to not let it interfere, and the person I was with (casual or more serious)would help me calm down. Not one ever asked how do we keep me from getting there. I hadn’t even thought about it being a mutual effort, it was always just my responsibility. And the fact that he cared about my safety it just… I got so emotional. I stepped away from our text conversation and just started crying. I don’t understand WHY tho. He literally is asking how he can help me not have panic attacks, and even said even if I have them and we can’t completely prevent them, he’ll be there to help me calm down and that that was okay. Like why would safety be upsetting? I want safety. I don’t like these panic attacks or flashbacks. So why was “hey how can I help keep you safe” sort of triggering in its own right? Has anyone dealt with something similar?	Inevitable-Noise5693	post	25.63035353805118	female	White	0.0018632831051945686	na	na	na	7	ptsd	no prediction.
"Basically the vulnerability is triggering you. He’s making you feel safe so your body is unsure if it’s just an act or real. PTSD has a lot to do with our nervous system as well. I’m in a similar situation with an ex of mine. She was abused growing up so I try to make her feel safe but I also have my own issues.

I still am going through this with my current partner, I was in a few abusive relationships and my idea of what my responsibilities were in a relationship were skewed and I began to see the abuse as the baseline. When I started dating my current partner he made it extremely clear to me that my happiness was what was important to him and that when we are being intimate my pleasure matters to him. This threw me for a loop and led to flash backs being triggered more easily.  It made the reality of the abuse more solid because I finally had something to compare it to. I wound up communicating that with him and he very happily supported me through all of it.	Inevitable-Noise5693	reply	na	na	na	0.0018632831051945686	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

My brain is finally accepted what I went through. For a long time the thoughts of “it wasn’t that bad, others had it worse” kept me in denial but protected me. Now I’m finally accepting the truth and it’s  more painful than I thought it would be. I don’t want to admit that bad things happened to me that have affected me to the point where I can’t function. But I have to, this denial isn’t getting me anywhere and just suffocates me more. For anyone who has gone through this how do you cope? I am in therapy but man even admitting these things to a professional hurts.	rock_angel_19	post	27.079061603744403	female	White	0.008992335759103298	na	na	na	12	ptsd	failed
"I’m going through this too. IFS therapy with EMDR is the only way i am finally able to start coming out of denial. I completely relate to what you’re saying. 

Is your therapist a trauma therapist?

I hope it gets easier soon, for both of us. The reason we are in denial IS because the truth is incredibly painful. So if you’re feeling the pain, that means you’re connecting to the truth. 

The word my therapist always uses is “congruent” to describe integrating my traumatic experiences with who i am today.

Being in denial makes you feel incongruent as a person - it’s like you’ve had these horrible things happen to you, but you waltzing around in LaLa Land pretending like it’s not that bad. Your behaviors and feelings aren’t fully congruent with your life experiences. 

Once you start coming out of denial, you start feeling all the the pain that’s been buried for years. It hurts, but it SHOULD hurt because what we went through was painful. It makes sense that it hurts. 

Your emotions are becoming congruent with your life experiences. Overall it makes you more “whole” to accept the truth vs be in denial."	rock_angel_19	reply	na	na	na	0.008992335759103298	weak	strong	strong	na	ptsd	failed
I saw another comment saying this, but journal. I like typing but physically writing can sometimes offer a different feeling. The pain I experience from being SA’d turns into anger. The person who did it to me suffered no consequences. I have suffered for many years. I know it hurts, it hurts so bad.

Yeah, this is a big one for me. For something to impact you so much, it had to be serious for you. Sure, people have different tolerances for things.

"Hello, I'm new here. I hope it's okay to share my story with you. i need to talk to someone but I can't in my real life.

I'm not sure if the trigger warning above is enough. Attention, trigger warning! 












I dated a guy in 2014, we got along really well. I was invited to a friend and I brought him with me. we made a campfire and the mood was good. the evening was really nice and I had hope that it could be serious with him. 

we stay there. he was a little touchy from a beer or two but he respected my no to sexual activity and we went to bed. I was tired and just wanted to sleep. 

I woke up because he raped me. 

in my confusion of waking up and trying to get away from him, he choked me. I was so perplexed. He laughed in my ear and said ""if you don't want to, I'll just have to rape you."" like it's the most normal thing in the world. 

I tried to fight back until I gave up eventually. 

at some point he let go of me but I just lay there. I was frozen in this situation. he rolled over and went to sleep. and I lay there staring at the wall and yeah. I just lay there. until night turned to day and the people in the house woke up. 



I have no idea what the day was like. I know nothing more than the explicit incident. 

What happened to me is burned into my brain. 

it's been almost 10 years now and no one knows about it. I think I repressed the whole thing very well for the first few years. although I often had nightmares and when I look at photos from back then I see the change. especially in my eyes. i lost a lot of weight. 

the memories kept coming back a few years ago. and I kept cramming it into the farthest corner of my brain. 

I have a boyfriend since a few years who is (thank god?) asexual and he's okay with us not having such activities. we sleep separately too, because I haven't been able to share a bed with anyone since then. I never told him the real reason. 

I've wanted to tell him for a long time. I want to tell someone in my life. but I can't. 

I feel like a liar because it's been so long. I'm afraid they'll see me differently then. I'm afraid that my boyfriend will find me repulsive. I blame myself for not fighting back enough.I feel guilty for not reporting him I feel guilty that I didn't do something. I'm kind of scared that someone will think I'm making this up. 

I had the plan to finally do therapy and finally get rid of this burden. but now i've been in therapy since january or so and i can't talk about it. i can't make it 

but now.. 

I saw him last week. I was standing at the bus stop and he passed me on his bike. i thought i was dying. the panic that set in was so intense. I convinced myself it wasn't him. but I know it was him. I know it. 

and today: I just came from work and the bus drives through an intersection right where I live and I see him again. right where I live. where I finally felt somehow safe. I had to get off and I went home. I really pray to God that he didn't recognize me. 

what am I doing now? what should i do? 

I'm so scared and I'm completely devastated and I can't talk to my boyfriend or anyone because I can't. lol. I know how that sounds myself. but it's somehow even scarier to say it. 

I'm sick. 


if anyone has read this in its entirety, thank you. 

and i'm sorry for my english, I'm not a native speaker but I'm afraid of being recognized."	Fade_away369	post	22.48734741562843	female	White	0.9794896841049194	na	na	na	18	ptsd	failed

For me it’s helped a lot to talk to myself out loud and say the things that feel scary to think/say. Things like “X did this. X is pathetic for resorting to such a desperate and soulless act. X is not a part of my life and does not have any control over it” such things. Also come up with a strategy for if you guys actually meet each other or he contacts you. Ways to feel like you’re in control. And I’d personally stress the pathetic-route. Because that is indeed what he is. Remind yourself that his darkness and actions were simply put on you, not a part of you.	Fade_away369	reply	na	na	na	0.9794896841049194	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
You take a little shelter wherever you can take it. You’re not weird or messed up, you had crazy shit brush with your life. You may be able to weather this storm yourself… but not very likely. Getting therapy is a positive outlet, not talking about the problem doesn’t allow them to help, but you also need to feel you can trust them. There are people that want to help, but take your time and let them earn your trust. This may never go away, but YOU can make your life the version you want it to be.

You get to feel however you feel, and to tell or not whomever you want. I sometimes would find myself in the same place where some trauma happened and it would ruin me for a few days. This is worse, so would expect it to be even more triggering. It takes me a while to snap back and realize I’m not just right back in that situation, and I suspect you will do the same. Give yourself time. Of course, it would help to find someone to talk to, but the most important thing is to be kind to and listen to yourself.

i already pay a lot of attention to my surroundings, but I'll do that even more intensively now and I'll make sure that he doesn't see remotely where I might live. Luckily this is a big city. although it's really crazy that I'm seeing him here twice within a week. he was living across town at the time.

I've managed this heavy shit for so long, I know I could continue to do it. only I don't know how it behaves now when the trigger is walking down my street.

Do what you can. If there is an easier way to get this information to your therapist, take it. You deserve to be heard. I’m so sorry you went through this. Take a moment and give yourself credit for taking the steps to make this post. That shows courage and the first steps to creating an openness to be able to speak about this. I know you don’t feel safe right now, but if possible, inside your own home, see if you can take a few moments each day to find a place you can sit, and just look around you, at the walls, pictures, the simple things you’ve built for yourself and that just exist around you, and slowly breathe. Just take stock of where you are. Listen to whatever sounds are around you. Touch the floor or wall- something firm. Remind your body that you are being held there in that moment, at least, safe right there. If the world is not safe for you right now, that one place can be.

"It sounds like you’re making a lot of efforts to keep this from others, and from yourself… that alone must be incredibly stressful- it’s a whole other burden to bear in silence on top of what you’re already dealing with… but this is one step towards you feeling okay talking about it and addressing it, and then there will be the next step, then the next. I hope that by posting here you can hear in real-time how many different people can empathize with you, and perhaps that can help you see that you are not an island in your pain and fear.

I am going to say something that may be challenging to hear, and I hope you can hear the immense care I have towards you and your situation behind it… but regardless of whether you share this with others (and you don’t have to), you will be “linked” to this forever anyways, just because it happened and it was real for you. I can see that the active denial of this event is actually causing more and more damage by remaining hidden… all this stress and effort, all this time trying o present something strong and perfect to the world, it’s weighing on you deeply. Now it may be a time to explore a different facet of your strength: vulnerability to ent loved by others who want to support you. If it helps you moving forward, know that surviving what you survived shows incredible resiliency. Know that this is a beautiful quality that actually helps people love you and connect to you. Some of my best friends and partners I’ve had have opened up to me about things like this and it made me respect and love them more, it made me feel special that they trusted me with something so personal, and it made me see deeper wells of their strength and beauty that informed deeper friendships and relationships. 

I think it’s amazing you posted here, because it shows you already want to share and grow and are in a place to start trying. Look at how people here are truly listening, and we aren’t even trained mental health professionals. Imagine how much better support you could receive from someone trained to help. Something that helped me go to therapy/counseling in the first place was me realizing that the people who choose to serve clients with sexual assault and rape in their past already decided they wanted to help listen to these problems. In fact they want to help with these problems so badly that they invested their entire scholastic lives and careers and daily lives to resourcing themselves to help. They exist in this professional context *just* for situations like these. It’s evidence that humans exist who genuinely want to listen. They already chose to listen before I chose to talk, and that really helped me see that other people could be the same. 

I hope you give therapy a chance- I think you’re ready and I think it will help because they can assist you in figuring out a pathway to be able to accept your trauma and move forward, however that looks like to you uniquely. I didn’t seek out therapy for almost 15 years after my first rape. It’s never too late to move through your grief.

"sorry it took me so long to reply.  I had to take everything apart first and it took me a while. but first of all: thank you for all your words and thoughts! I appreciate that very much. 

>It sounds like you’re making a lot of efforts to keep this from others, and from yourself… that alone must be incredibly stressful [..]

yeah, that's exactly how it is. you are right, yes, somehow I have resigned myself to the fact that it is what it is. and I've been telling myself for a while now that i will be okay with that. that is actually very stressful, yes. And I'm not doing myself any favors either, I know. 

i've been told many times on other subjects that I'm exaggerating or being dramatic. I think that's why the fear exists. and somehow this stupid thought that ""it's not that bad after all"". 

>I hope that by posting here you can hear in real-time how many different people can empathize with you [..]

I appreciate all the words of sympathy and encouragement very much! for any thoughts, being able to ""talk"" to someone and having someone listen to me. thanks a load. ♥️ 

>[..] but regardless of whether you share this with others (and you don’t have to), you will be “linked” to this forever anyways, just because it happened and it was real for you.

That's true.. I think I kind of knew that, but someone had to tell me again. sometimes I think it's like a black cloud and everyone sees it anyway. but you are right. it's there anyway, it's my reality. thank you for making that clear for me! 

>I can see that the active denial of this event is actually causing more and more damage by remaining hidden [..] it’s weighing on you deeply. 

yes, very much.. you're very right again. I know deep in my heart that it would only help me to finally say something and talk about it. but you can understand this unbelievable feeling of shame that I feel, right, how do you put that down? 
 
>Now it may be a time to explore a different facet of your strength: vulnerability to ent loved by others who want to support you. 

very true. At the same time, I'm totally afraid of overwhelming someone who can't handle it. my mom eg. all have their own problems. 

>If it helps you moving forward, know that surviving what you survived shows incredible resiliency. Know that this is a beautiful quality that actually helps people love you and connect to you.

I really wish that helps to connect.. I share your experience in this. it didn't change anything and actually I was just happy and so proud that the person was so brave and able to tell me. because I've been silent for so long, I feel like no one really knows me. and I'm scared that's exactly what's gonna fall on my feet, you know?

you are right (again), yes. i want to!! i have to. I think I owe it to myself to some extent for getting help. somehow the thought never crossed my mind! but it is exactly as you write it. thank you so much for your perspective on therapy. Really, I've never looked at it that way.

"Well first off please don’t apologize to me, a total stranger, for taking the time you need to respond. You get to do all of this on your own timeline. In fact, in all the trauma therapy I’ve received, the *most* important thing is that the victim can do everything on their own terms, to regain control over a situation in which control was taken from them. 

I’d love for you to slowly start to take the situations you’re in and slowly start to look for opportunities to “give yourself credit” for what you are doing- it helps to reframe the mind away from the fight or flight reactive fear mind. For example: when you are thinking of all the things you have to do about this and start to guilt yourself over what you haven’t done yet, pause and give yourself credit for what you have done… saying to yourself “I’ve survived for years and put the work in to finally be ready to open up,” “I stepped out of my comfort zone and shared my story for the first time,” “I engaged with others to begin a process of healing,” “I spent x hours processing today- and that shows me I’m prioritizing myself.” When we give credit for the “smaller” actions we take we can start to create a positive feedback loop that encourages more small steps towards growth. Honestly I think you’re doing amazing, and have shown how ready you are to begin moving forward! 

It will be a part of your healing to rebuild your confidence, so that the opinions of other people matter far less. But I will say this- there’s NOTHING dramatic about anyone’s reactions to being raped. It is one of the worst things that can happen to you. Period. Anyone who would say that discussing how this impacted you is “dramatic” is NOT your friend. Yes, when we share we open ourselves up to reactions that may not help us or could hurt us… and honestly that’s a part of why people stay silent for so long: they simply do not have the bandwidth to handle an adverse reaction. But you are strong enough now to start talking, and you are also probably strong enough to handle someone else not reacting perfectly too. I know that I have learned that when I do share my story, I will learn a lot about those around me by their reactions. Those reactions are a reflection on them, not me. So if someone can’t handle it I just log that in my brain, and I deprioritize them as friends because quite frankly if they can’t handle hearing about the realities of life then I can’t rely on them as a friend at all. I only want people around me who are capable humans, and anyone who would negatively react to this would be considered someone who just isn’t emotionally together enough for me to care that deeply about. They’ll only ever help on the surface level, so that’s where I keep them. The ones who respond positively get brought closer to my heart and give lm more of my time, so that way my energy is only going towards relationships with positive feedback loops of mutual support and empathy. 


The shame is so real. So so real. It’s crazy too because the shame is completely illogical! We don’t shame victims of other crimes in the way we shame rape victims… but a part of it I think is just… the fact that someone else completely dehumanized us. They took away our personhood. They turned us into an object to be used. To have someone who you care about do this to you is absolutely mind boggling to wrap your mind around. Sometimes I think I spent so long feeling shame because on some level I wanted to feel I was in part “responsible” so that I could regain the idea that I was in part in control of the situation- I couldn’t face how dehumanizing me and completely taking my control from me meant that I was just… completely vulnerable and alone, at the mercy of a monster. The shame hurts so badly though… the shame is so hard to shake off. This is something that will take time, but it can and will go away if you can focus on validating the truth: you are not responsible for other people’s actions. You are bearing the burden of someone else’s actions. You did nothing wrong. 

Part of how I got my shame to go away was through the process of sharing. Hearing how many other people had also been through this, hearing how they all had felt the same feelings I felt, made me start to think that there wasn’t anything wrong with me, that I wasn’t alone.

"I tried telling my social worker that my foster mother was raping me, and I just got a lecture about how I can't say things like that, and that it has real-world consequences. That was when I was around 8. My foster mother, Angela aka Anne, pretended to be just a sweet lonely older woman, who was active in the church. My social worker assumed I didn't like her and was lying. 

Those real world consequences were very real. The consequences of it being ignored, were (for me) several crippling drug addictions by 18, antisocial personality disorder, and a lot of prison time, and one of very very few people who has died to suicide, and been bought back to life because I was rescued quickly enough. 

I completely agree, women are just treated like caregivers and parents who would never hurt a child. So when things like this does happen, it's ignored and fucks people up for life."	Jagger9093	reply	na	na	na	0.991926372051239	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

I just wanted to put this out there. I have found a great deal of peace through meditation, yoga, non-duality and the moderate use of marijuana.  It appears that a persistent multi-faceted approach is really the only things that really work for me.  I still have to work on things, but I think most people do, with or without PTSD.

"[TW - suicide, SH (not graphic) and swearing]

Another ramble post with no point since that's all I seem capable of on this sub.

I got triggered yesterday after already having a shitty day due to a migraine. So to try and distract myself I switched to scouring a backup drive of my old phone so I could laugh at outdated memes that I'd forgotten about. Imagine the horror when I found an old photo of my abuser and I along with a mutual friend, dated not too long before the *really* bad stuff started. We looked happy in that picture and I spiraled hard. Found a screenshot of a text conversation that that mutual friend had sent me years ago in which he was going after my abuser for justifying their actions. I started crying for the first time in fuck knows how long. It isn't fucking fair. We looked so happy in that photo and I had to go and fuck it up. I deserved every last bit of it and no amount of therapy will ever be able to gaslight me into thinking otherwise. I was a piss-poor excuse for a person back then and I thought I'd grown up and learned a thing it two from it but nope! I'm still just as shitty as I was then. Next to no empathy and no energy to try to change that. Can't relate to others beyond surface level sympathy. Don't give a shit about 99% of anything. I swear I'm a fucking narcissist. How anyone tolerates me is beyond understanding. I don't deserve jack shit. 

So I spiraled and apparently dissociated last night because I woke up to pretty clear evidence of an attempt. First attempt of 2023. Can't believe I held out this long to be honest. I broke a 2-month or so clean streak to cut again this morning out of despair. It isn't fucking fair. I've been comparing plane ticket prices to go back to my abuser, because I know that they won't fail in killing me. Debating actually going through with it despite knowing what I'll have to do to get them to kill me.
Life isn't fucking fair and I just want to be normal. The 6th anniversary of the first time is coming up next month. It feels like it was yesterday.

Despite feeling like __ today and 2 months after my assault, I pushed myself to go outside and do a hobby I enjoy (DJ workshop). After I will see a concert of a musician I have always wanted to see live - I am exhausted but it’s amazing feeling (for a small moment) excited about life.	paloma_paloma	post	12.566076615261965	male	White	0.0013881567865610123	na	na	na	8	ptsd	failed
"Update: it was a success (with some tweaks) and went to the concert which started at 23:00 🎉 I went to the workshop, but left early after I was beginning to feel a bit overwhelmed. Not full overwhelm, but step 1. It was a good call because it gave me time and space to say hi to friends nearby at the venue. Not a long conversation, a “Hi, nice to see you here. I have to go but it was nice running into you. Let’s talk more later.” No one noticed or thought it was weird. I also told a friend working at the venue about the best time to arrive at the concert to avoid waiting in lines at night alone. 

Concert: went home to rest for 2.5 hours. Ate real food. Calmed my nervous system. Bathroom. Made sure my cell phone was charged and I had water/snack. 

Arrived at venue at time recommended by friend. Got in without waiting in the line at 23:00 with people drinking alcohol. Got a good seat which felt safe. Success ✨ 

Even better, show ended. I had energy to approach and initiate conversation to say hi to the artist that I liked the show. My social skills and ability to talk to new people (better yet an internationally acclaimed artist I respect) are not dead!

I was raped at 10 by my absent father. He got custody of me a year prior and it was just physical abuse and one day it just happened. And I can’t fucking sleep. It’s been almost 20 years and if I’m not drunk, high, medicated or some kind of downer I have panic attacks. So bad I get stuck in a loop of the past. It’s like I’m there all over again. It pisses me off he still has a hold over me. Like I’m a box of discounted damaged goods and he got the last laugh leaving me split. I can’t fucking take it. It drives me insane. If I’m not working, or reading or doing anything it creeps on me like a rash. And I can feel his fingers all over me. And the fucking smell of beer. It twists my stomach, I can’t breathe. It’s been a while since my last attack. And I quit cold turkey because I thought I would be fine. Not even 24 hours and I’m shaking, whimpering in a corner stuck in that fucking room again, tied to the fucking bed. I’ve been to therapy, I’ve been on meds and im going insane. Some days are fine but most days I wish I was anything but me. I’ll be fine, im fine, but fuck it’s scary. I just hate feeling this hopeless.

"For a few years after some stuff went down, I couldn't sleep in a bed. When I did manage to sleep at all, it was in weird places instead. The kind of places that didn't feel like a bed at all.

Under the bed. 

Between the bed and the wall. 

Sitting up in my car. 

On the floor in a blanket nest.

It's weird advice, but it worked for me. So...I'm sharing just in case it helps at all here too.

Though I know you probably already tried something like it a long time ago.

> Like I’m a box of discounted damaged goods and he got the last laugh leaving me split. 

You're still you. Underneath it. Every year carries you farther away from him.

Your brain is just trying to protect you like the parent you should've had. It's reacting in a completely logical way to the circumstances it's experienced.

It learned a long time ago that sleep isn't safe. And now the name of the game is just finding a way to tell it that...hey, brain, we don't have to do that anymore. We're safe now.

Try to remember that, okay? 

It doesn't feel like it, but you're safe now.

That's why he didn't win. He's gone. And I hope wherever he is, he's rotting for being a box of inhuman trash.

There's no redeeming what he is. He will never be human again. Not after what he did. He scarred his own soul in every way that matters. 

Nothing else about him matters now. Any accomplishment he ever had is voided and worthless. Overshadowed by the defining character trait of being the worst kind of person anyone can be.

*He* is damaged goods. Ruined goods. Black ooze in a skin suit.

He'll never shake the hold that his actions have over him. No matter what he says, does, regrets, or lies to himself about: he will always be the caliber of ""person"" whose murder would be applauded by people who've never even met him.

You? You're just a decent person whose life includes medical complications from an illness you never asked for.

I'm reading this workbook called ""Getting Unstuck From PTSD"", which is a self administered CPT book, and it seems to emphasize that it has worked really well on sexual assault victims and even child sexual assault victims.

"I've had a similar problem.  Dad molested me, sleep problem.  There's a lot of people who are saying useful shit here. Wanted to chime in with this:

STAY AWAY FROM BENZOS.  A doc gave me them. I used them as prescribed for a few months. They worked ok. I didn't feel a high or anything. Decided I didn't need them after a few months.  Stopped taking them. Massive withdrawals, had to go back on, and it's taken over a year of titrating off of them. It's destroyed my life. I'm in the process of healing and rebuilding.

I did start meditating. I started watching my thoughts.  Started listening to some people on YouTube.  Louis Howes was molested as a kid. Mel Robins too.  Others.  Sometimes people say stuff I don't relate to or sounds off. I'm just there to pick up what works, so I throw out what doesn't.


Got into Joe Dispenza's stuff as well as many others. He talks about practicing emotional states.  I'm trying that out.  I think it's having an effect.

A lot of people talk about forgiveness and compassion towards their abusers.

I'm glad they found a way with that.  I've tried that. It doesn't flow. I'm at a point where I'm just accepting that my dad's a piece of shit and I'm really excited for the day he dies. If there's a hell, he's going. And then I try and move on with my day.

Medical PTSD here. My brain was so much in hyper fear/shock I did use benzos because I had to (didn’t want to). Brain calming down now so tapering off slowly and no big problems there. Like you, I still need sedatives to sleep because in the quiet of the night, my fear brain shifts into higher alert like something bad can happen again any moment. My thinking brain knows nothing is happening. So it’s confusing because your original trauma experience is long gone but your fear brain doesn’t pay attention to time. Then is the same as now. The books mentioned in the comments can explain it but doesn’t change it. As weird as this sounds, your thinking brain in the present has to keep reminding your timeless fear brain that you are now OK and safe. The past is terrible but it can’t hurt you anymore. It’s a story of a sad history event like other such stories in history. View it as that and not as one who lived it.

Honestly, before it happened to me I would think 'if that ever happened to me, i dont even know what i'd do.

If we see eachother in the street, I would look him straight in the eye to say 'how can you be so heartless' and he can't look at me. He just gets out his phone.

If any of this helps, that makes me really happy.

It took about ten years...but I finally am. Yeah. 

Made it back to the land of the living. Finished putting out smoldering ashes on the hill where all of this burned me down to my bones. There's some bright and beautiful new forests growing there, now. 

I'm actually at peace after all of this, if you can believe that. A whole person again. No more fear under the skin. 

Just a surprisingly simple lingering sadness for the kid who grew up the way he did, because...that's what's left. Apparently. 

With the self-hatred gone, the revulsion resolved, the obscene unfairness of fate forgiven, the compulsion to understand every inch of this issue satisfied, and the nuclear reactor of rage defunct and cooled down.

Just...sad. 

Because he didn't deserve to suffer. And he didn't deserve to suffer alone.

So sometimes I come back to places like this. You know?

Might as well share my notes from last year's exams with other people who also don't deserve to have to suffer alone.

"TW: drowning, attempted suicide

When I was a little kid, probably six or seven, I didn‘t know how to swim. I went to the pool with my friends and a friend and I swam to the deep end where we couldn’t stand. She fell off her floatie and I reached in to pull her onto my floatie. I ended up falling off and we both were drowning. No lifeguard or other person came to help and it was a solid maybe 2 minutes of us struggling to stay afloat, but it felt like longer. Eventually someone‘s mom jumped in and pulled us out. I’ve tried to avoid using those types of floaties now because of this, but I still have an attraction to water. Every time I have attempted, it’s been with the same thing I was scared of as a kid (this scenario, Reddit rules won’t let me describe it but you’re smart people). Is it less traumatic because I’m not trying to stay alive? Does anyone else feel drawn to the thing that is a source of their trauma?

"NSFW due to mention of suicide, but I've tried to give only basic/relevant detail. I also want to preface by saying: for 10 years my PTSD has ALWAYS been directly related to the 72 hours before, during, and after I was told my dad had died. But today, my trigger and experience was totally different.

Around 10 months ago, I decided to move in with 5 strangers. We become friends quite quickly - but around 9 months ago (approx 1 month in) one of the girls in the house attempted to take her life. She was with just 2 other housemates that night, who both chose to keep it private, upon a request she made to maintain her dignity. 

I came home a few days later, unaware of her attempt, and sat with her to watch some TV. Over the course of maybe an hour, I unknowingly accompanied her as she experienced the symptoms of her second attempt. To make matters worse -  where I was sitting forward watching TV, and she was lying back and almost fully outside my peripheral, I learned in the ambulance that she had done so right beside me. We got to the hospital at 2AM, and I stayed up with her, before leaving at 12PM that day. It's a complicated story...but the short is: her parents were contacted and she was moved out a week later.

Skip to today. I've been visiting family for the past 2 weeks, and walked back into my house for the first time since this evening. Maybe I became used to the smell of the house...but as soon as I walked in, the house smelled exactly like the first few weeks I was there. It smelled like her bedroom. It smelled like dressing her for the ambulance. It smelled like re-entering the house later that day, after walking the whole way back from the hospital. It was like someone put that night in a bottle and sprayed it all over house. Nobody was home, but I started freaking out. Like I couldn't breathe. I had a massive panic attack and had to take time to compose myself. I thought my PTSD was specific to my experience losing my dad, but maybe I was wrong. And now I nervously await the next trigger I might suddenly experience in this house. I guess I'm just frustrated that it was (and is) so obviously a way bigger deal to me than I managed to convince myself!"

Self validation is a skill I wish I had learned early on because like the previous commenter said, don’t hold your breath waiting for acknowledgment or an apology for what they did. Took 45 years to get a half assed/insincere and minimizing apology from my abusive mother. By that time I didn’t need one and told her that. Also don’t need that in my life anymore. You validate it for yourself. Your experiences are yours, and as you get older you’ll gain a new perspective - they’re always valid and just bc someone else denies it, doesn’t take away from your trauma. Even when I was invalidating my own abuse years after it occurred, my trauma influenced me to parent my child a different and healthier way than I had been.

"Approximately 2-3 years ago, I was still struggling with self-harm ideation and could not stop the cyclical thoughts of my own death that played in my head like multiple news reports playing at once. Also during that time, my blood work came back showing a lower-than-normal level for Vitamin D, which is apparently common for adults in my area, especially ones who work in remote jobs like I did back then.

My doctor advised me to begin taking two capsules a day, which was steadily increased to five, per my blood work, until my levels finally stabilized a couple of months later.

The most noticeable difference for me, however, was my mood. Not only did I no longer entertain self-harm, but I also began eliminating negative self-talk as well, which eventually also improved my self-esteem. 

Granted, I still have instances where the wrong trigger at the wrong place/time can catch me off-guard, but these days I feel much more equipped to take them on, as I both understand them better as well as myself and my emotions.

"Hi, I was diagnosed with PTSD months ago due to a sexual assault that occurred from an ex girlfriend.

I have had occasional flashbacks but they have gotten worse recently. They mostly revolve around the feeling of powerlessness and the intense physical pain I felt from the event.

I had one today where I relived the event all over again, and then got nauseous and felt like I was going to throw up.

Yep.. it's also a panic attack.. during flashbacks your whole body travels backwards in time. In short, it's your dysregulated nervous system, which is a direct result of the traumatic event.

"CW CSA//

I was sexually abused and trafficked by my father for most of my childhood. My recurring nightmares are rarely about the abuse itself, which I remember very little of. Instead they're about have to pretend I'm fine while sharing space with my abuser day-to-day, and feeling overwhelming rage/disgust/desperation inside. I get stuck in these dreams, in that I can only wake up for a few moments before I shut back down into sleep and the dream picks up where it left off.

 I feel it would help me if I could imagine a fix to try in the dreams (I'm mostly lucid in them & have some control), but I literally can't think of how I could get myself into a safer environment as a child/a disabled teen unable to work a job. Where could I have gone, what could I have done, to save myself from him if I'd been emotionally able to take any action I chose? I have such bad police trauma (some of them were trafficking ""clients"") that going straight to the cops is not an option my brain will accept.

So I’m 18M and have trouble asking for help from literally anyone. I just got back from a Wendy’s trip and came home bawling because my fiancé paid for my food and accidentally dropped hers and I cried my eyes out because she doesn’t get to eat the food she bought and I get to eat the food she bought me. She had no issue with it and just explained she’d eat everything else but I offered to go back and pay or pay her back for the order and I broke the fuck down. She also offered to help me this week financially as its my birthday and we’re seeing my dad. The reason she’s helping is because I bought a present for myself after we agreed she was absolutely fine with helping me out in like handing me 5 for gas. We split car bills but I am the bread winner of the two of us and often pay for extra shit we do like gas and food and other stuff we both need to survive like toothpaste deodorant etc etc. I feel horrible asking her to help and I’ve honestly been crying about it since it happened.

I'm so sorry you're going through that.  I'm not sure if this will resonate with you but maybe needing to ask for help, of any kind, feels like a loss of control?  And after trauma we want as much control over our environment as we can get because we had little or no control during the trauma.  I have a really hard time with even the idea of needing help, especially physically, like with moving furniture or heavy stuff.  I have this entrenched idea that I should be able to completely take care of myself without help from anyone and if I can't then there's something wrong with me.  Of course that's ridiculous and not remotely true, but I still feel that way.	Bonsaitalk	reply	na	na	na	0.9992026686668396	strong	strong	strong	na	ptsd	no prediction.
It definitely is in a sort. I think it’s one of two things. 1 it’s a loss of Control which during traumatic times meant a loss of my freedom and individuality and often times when I asked for help in the past it was either dismissed or someone got mad and just did it for me so I’m afraid one of those two things will happen. Second is the fact I’ve had to do everything alone up until this point and if I didn’t it just didn’t happen and I think in my head I’ve believed that if I don’t do it myself some sort of negative thing will come of it or I’ll be “less of a man” because that was often a narrative that was pushed on to me.

For me extremely vivid memories/dream states, sometimes to the point of causing dissociation ie lack of connection with the outside world.

"That’s really the only way I know how to describe it. The nightmares, flashbacks and random triggers. It’s like my brain is trying to dump all that toxicity out of it…except it feels like a forever detox because healing isn’t linear. 

I haven’t been triggered in a year and lately my nightmares wake me up at 4am and can’t go back to sleep because my brain is still in the nightmare even though I’m awake. Just watch TV until my 7am alarm. Days are exhausting…

The random triggers are annoying. I’ll see a car that he hasn’t owned in 10 years and still panic that it’s him. If I want to nap and remember I left my door unlocked (but I live in a secure access building) I’ll just start crying from convincing myself he’s about to bust in, even though the “problem” could be settled in 10secs by walking across the room and locking front door…

"TW: death, gore & SA

I don’t want to put any identifying details in this as it was a big news story at the time and will probably come up again after the coroners report later this year. 

But basically, someone I know died suddenly in a very tragic and gruesome accident at the beginning of the year. I’ve always been very scared of death and particularly, dying in a horrible way, so hearing about her death was traumatic for me. Like I said, I can’t give away about her death, but she was attacked by animals which I think I is one of the worst ways to go. 

I was raped in my sleep last year by a former friend of mine who knew I was a lesbian  and have been furring from moderate-severe PTSD since, so the news hit me harder than it would have usually. 

I spent months trying to recover from her death. I constantly had nightmares and visions of the attack. I’m a big fan of horror gore/slasher movies, so my imagination for these things is very vivid, but I’ve never been scared because I know it’s fake. Knowing that something like that can happen in real life is terrifying. 

I have just spent 2 hours reading through witness statements which came from the police. Although they were partially redacted, leaving me wondering about a few things, the general gist is that she died quickly from bites to the neck. I probably won’t ever find out the exact details, as the statements I read were partially redacted - it may come out in the press  after the corners inquest, which has the potential to destroy me mentally but im trying not to think about that for now.

But for now, I have found a way to calm the distressing thoughts I’ve had of her having her face ripped off while still alive and screaming for help. I don’t think I’ll ever recover from her death, but having this slight reassurance makes it easier to live with"	sinkinthevoid	post	23.85576608529476	female	White	0.0024828247260302305	na	na	na	2	ptsd	no prediction.

Yesterday, there was a family barbecue at my parent’s house. There was about 20 people of my extended family present. I am 30 years old. When I (30M) was 5-7 years old, I was molested multiple times by a cousin (32M) who was 7-9 years old at the time. He would trick me into performing oral sex on him because he framed it as an innocent “game.” This cousin showed up to the barbecue, and I stood up and told the family that I had a story to share after 25 years and I pointed to him and I said “better yet, you tell the story.” He froze. A physical fight broke out (pushing and shoving), as everyone took my cousin’s side and called me a liar. The police showed up after 5 minutes and I filed a report. I am a decorated veteran and a graduate school educated political scientist, so I asked the police officer, why would I want or need to lie about something after 25 years. My entire family gaslit and victim-blamed me for speaking my truth. An inconvenient truth. Now, I have a target on my back because of my decision to speak the truth.		post	32.16096199954423	male	White	0.99379962682724	na	na	na	69	ptsd	no prediction.

"My older cousin used to touch me in my sleep when I was 13/14 and he was about the same age. 

I used to wake up to it, and I told my mom. But nothing ever happened. I don’t think they believed me because I hardly believed myself.

When I was 8, my younger cousin, maybe 7, told me to be the mom, she would be the dad. She would hide us under the bed and then she would touch me. She had to have been abused to know what any of that was. So I don’t hate her, but I can’t see her without feeling sick. I knew it was wrong and I remember feeling immense guilt about it afterwards as a child.

I told my mom and she brought me to Chuck E. Cheese.

I don’t know why I’m saying this. Maybe because I don’t know anyone else who was touched as a kid, by their cousins who were also kid.

No one ever did anything for me because they were also “just kids.” It still fucks me up.

It still keeps me awake at night. The younger cousin I am not going to blame. I do wish my parents did something for me. But she was too young to realize and I’m sure it haunts her too. But the cousin who was older than me. I don’t talk to him. I hate him. He knows what he did. He pretends it never happened. We were so close growing up. We were best friends. He told everyone I just “got weird.” Said he doesn’t know why I didn’t want to hang out anymore. We are in our 20s now. I haven’t talked to him in over 5 years. 

My mom never did anything even though she asked me once after spending the night “is he was doing anything to you?” I broke down and started crying saying I don’t know. She ignored it. 

I can’t even think about it without getting mad. Im not trying to make this about myself.

Aye. My extended family chose my molesting pedo loser brother over me as well.

Like you I have a lot of accomplishments in the worldly sense and should be more credible than the idiot brother but nope they chose him. It’s been years and it ain’t gonna change.

"People react violently to social disturbances for three reasons in my experience.

To protect. 

To deny. 

Or to punish. 

The odd thing about the last one, is that a person will hold back from committing to punishing someone else if there's any doubt in their mind, or if they know themselves that they share guilt. 

That leads to the second, to deny that what is being said is valid, to shout down the words that cannot be met with a reasonable truth.

Which lastly leads to the first reason.

To protect the life that's been build around a world view that has been threatened by a narrative which will call into question the certainty they hold at the core of their heart that what they did wasn't that bad. 

That it was years ago. That it didn't matter. That it didn't mess them up. Didn't make them act out. Didn't hurt anyone. 

They buried their guilt under that bullshit and cannot see themselves as a good person without those lies they whispered to themselves to justify being a monster. 

Your family will react in a similar way, because they too will not want to see the monster they have learned to love. And definitely won't want to remember all the times they've questioned if something wasn't quite right. 

The avoidance of guilt maybe then should be the fourth reason people get violent. 

Spinless cowards all of them for saying something couldn't be true instead of having the courage to say that it could have been something they missed or ignored. 

They'd rather cling to a comforting lie spun by a monster that some called father, or brother, or uncle, or cousin, or grandpa. 

That being said, give them time. Family ties run deep and loyalty is not always rational."		reply	na	na	na	0.99379962682724	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"This is sadly a very typical reaction from family.  I don't know quite what it is. I did hear from my sister's therapist that the family doesn't want to lose any members, so they believe (maybe subconsciously) that attacking the victim means the rapist isn't kicked out of the family and the victim will just take it.

I don't know if that's right. Also my sister's therapist has proven herself to be unethical and pretty dumb.

I think what it is is that denial of something horrible is easier than processing it. People often take the easy way out.  They do what feels better  instead of what's right.

My dad molested me as a kid. When it came out, my sister verbally abused the living shit out of me.  After a couple years of that, I informed her calmly in an email I never wantes to see or speak to her again.  I detailed why.  My sister decided to keep up a relationship with our dad.What's ironic is her husband was molested by his brother and she was enraged about it and witnessed his whole family take the brother's side and treat her husband like garbage.

No one is close in the rest of our family.

Recently, she's seemed to realize our dad is a piece of shit in many regards. Her and started talking again after 5 years of not talking. It's civil.  She's aired some of her grievances about our relationship and I've listened and responded to the best of my ability. 

I personally will probably never talk to her about my grievances or anything deeply personal for that matter. After the way she treated me all those years, I do not see her as a mature adult capable of rational and emotionally intelligent conversation.  I love her very much, but she's an emotionally stunted person with poor ethics and values. So, her actions and opinions are inconsequential to me.  Again, love her very much. She has zero credibility in my eyes. It's like a 3 year old critiquing my architecture skills.  I don't care and I'm not gonna attempt a deep conversation with her.

I don't know if seeing your family members who reacted badly with zero credibility would help, but it helps me.  I don't know if refusing to talk to those family members would bring you peace, but it was a huge weight off my shoulders.

You did the right thing. You're brave. The path to healing is often filled with moments like these.

"Listen im with you but at the same time ive heard stories before of kids experimenting themselves and have that as  a game and do fancy stuff very early. I caught my little cousin on top of my other cousin 8 years ago for example with clothes on but still who knows what other things theyve done , 8 and 7 btw. I couldnt blame one over the other, not with what ive seen. Looked like they  both enjoyed that ""fun"" experience as much, didnt seem like a cunning move from the boy to the girl or vice versa not that the age gap was so big that one was using the other

Its weird but when i talked to them, like wtf you doing, stop that is wrong blabla, it seems both knew something was wrong by doing that which clearly showed to me that was a both way thing.

Now if he was 9 and you 5, yeah thats debatable that he used you and most likely that would be the case  but if you were 7 and he was 7 and both of you found a ""game"" that you had fun at the time, i dont know. Based on my experience i couldnt blame one of the two, i was harsh on both of them and  was pretty clear both of them knew what they were doing and that was  totally wrong by their reactions.

In the end of the day you know better than i am your situation and you might be 100% right, so do what you have to do, go to the police and give him in. But if youre not 100%  that he is 100% in fault, well reconsider what happened and be honest because you might ruin someones life over a mistake you both have done and is to blame yet only one is gonna pay for it. You know better than i am what really happened so act accordingly because this is really sensitive matter.

"I just want to say, I know your pain here. I finally aired my father’s dirty laundry wrt his severe physical and emotional abuse growing up, after he escaped six frigging child molestation charges. His family (my aunts and uncles) gaslit and denied. Their kids (my cousins) all supported me, one uncle who also abused me sexually had the gall to tell me FB wasn’t the place to do this and that I should ‘patch things up with my father, he’s the only one I have’. I called him out for his abuse, too. Fuck it. I was widowed at 38 and have fought to get myself back for four years, I have a chance at a life now as I recently got engaged, I’m a couple years away from an MS in biomedical engineering, I don’t give a fuck anymore, I’m speaking my truth and unburdening myself of the requirement to mask to protect my abusers. If his brothers and sisters can’t handle it, I don’t need them. Some of them abused their kids too, as a number of them approached me in DMs to tell me their truth. Thank god our generation all individually collectively chose to break this cycle. 

I know it fucking hurts to be shamed and blamed and denied when your own family rejects your truth. I am so sorry you have experienced that.

"I agree with both comments so far. Mirtazapine can help a lot! I just stopped it after a short period of time because it made my appetite crazy… I have* (edit) digestive issues and was shoveling the wrong food in my mouth in the middle of the night lol. 

Also, finding the right therapist is difficult but worth it. I’d recommend EMDR, especially for the things that are hard to talk about. I tried CPT and CBT without minor improvements. I’m in EMDR now and it’s more like talk therapy where I get to kind of ramble about the memories and emotions it brings up. 

I don’t know what it’s like being a female, and I’m sure it’s scary as hell, but finding a setting where you can be around men who are safe might help (?)… kind of like exposure therapy. Are there any support groups around your area that you might feel okay checking out? 

I don’t want to over step any boundaries with my suggestion. I just had a terrible fear of sharing things for over a decade, until I got asked to be a part of a pilot group for IOP trauma therapy. Once I got in the room and someone had to share I actually felt SO much more relaxed.

"Ever since I (26F) developed ptsd from a longterm relationship with an abusive person, I haven't been able to work somewhere for more than 6 months at a time.

I used to be a great employee that had no problem, and even enjoyed, working with the public, learning new things, and getting recognized for my work. I've always struggled with anxiety (generalized and social) and depression, but it never impacted my work. 

It's been roughly 4 years since I developed ptsd, and it's impacted not only my everyday life, but I can't even work anymore. I feel so useless, I feel like such a burden on my loved ones because of it. I can't do anything to contribute to my household (me and my partner.) When I've tried to work, I last maybe a few months before I start having frequent (weekly) anxiety attacks and full on mental breakdowns within 6 months, and then I leave to protect myself from myself. I freeze when I have to help/talk to people, especially if they're upset. What made me quit my last job was a man yelling in the store for about 15 minutes (not at me, but coworker and manager) and the yelling sent me into a full panic. Prior to that, I left a job after being yelled at over a chocolate croissant as soon as I had clocked in. I just can't handle talking to people anymore. They scare me. I also start drinking heavily to numb the intense anxiety that comes with working, which is obviously not something I should do, and has caused health problems for me (im no longer like that, but I'm afraid to go back to that, as well.)  

Now, I have medical bills piling up, student loan payments past due, no health insurance, credit card debt, most accrued before I had problems when I work (and had been paying them off to the best of my ability after ptsd diagnosis.) My boyfriend helps me with them, but I feel so awful that I cannot do anything. I've gotten to the point where I'm just selling my most valuable objects just to pay for my multiple medications and doctors appointments. I filed for disability, but it's unlikely that I'll be approved due to not being ""disabled enough."" I tried to contact a disability attorney, but my anxiety has been so bad lately, that I haven't been able to call back, never the less go in person. 

I just want to be able to pay off my debt and be able to pay for therapy and my medications, and I've just reached my wits end, tbh. I don't know what to do anymore other than suck it up and talk to an attorney, even if I do embarrass myself by having a full on anxiety attack in their office; which at least could prove I am not well in the head, I suppose. I'm just so tired of dealing with these problems, I wish it never got to this point.

You are not bad or wrong. You are hurting. This is very hard on you.

You sound like about 80% of Americans right now, so not only are you not alone you are normal, according to the times. This is a very tough time for Americans. I have brutal PTSD from 32 years in law enforcement and the doctor just wants to drug me. As I became a full blown alcoholic to self medicate and had recently quit why would I want to be drugged? I wanted a social gathering to talk to other people with my sort of PTSD, which is not the same as combat vets or rape and abuse victims. I am a year strong now without getting drunk and recently had my first beer in a year with my cousin and didn't need to hit the shots after. I'd say, first, you need to see a professional, but as you say you have medical bills I wonder if it's for this or you are sick with other ailments and never mentioned the trauma. If you have seen a doc and the bills are from PTSD meds, which are not working, then you need to change the doc and change the therapy. See a crisis Counselor. There is a hotline now for every town. Just Google crisis hotline number (name of your town) and you will get it.  Reddit and comments help a little bit you sound like you need a person right next to you. We are human beings, after all. We are not designed to be alone. If you want to work and need the income find a job that does not require being around other people. Postal carriers are always in demand, and maybe even get a job as a crisis Counselor. You are on call and just go to calls with your partner and you go to help people with exactly what you have, which makes you an expert. Plus maybe you make a friend and help each other.

Hey. As a(nother?) trans guy...I know we're a political football right now, and there's a lot of loud arguments online about it.

But FWIW, almost all of the people I've met in real life have either been supportive, or don't care. They have better things to worry about than our genders.

Others passively hold shitty opinions, but...still have better things to worry about. And won't actively attack you or anything.

Especially as you get older and aren't dealing with obnoxious teenagers looking for drama.

People might surprise you about this. In a good way. Even though there's no guarantee. 

Especially if you pass well.

I also have CPTSD and am disabled. I've had multiple sclerosis for 20 years. I was diagnosed at 17, therefore never able to drive. It is truly, despite so much garbage, the one thing I'd change if I'm ever able to. I love interacting with people. I overcame most of my traumas by age 25, I was finally painfully happy then in 2010. Between 2010 and now, I have had to cut ties with 2 best friends because of horrible treatment of myself and others around them. I also had a horrific romantic relationship from 2010-2019. A bleeding ulcer and almost dying, plus 4 MS relapses, helped me close that door for good finally. Aside from the traumas involved with it, he told me he would ruin my life if I finally ended things with him. He has been doing just that. Because of that and so much other bullshit, I am beyond terrified of trying to open up or even just being around people at times. I hate it. I know I will one day be better, but I have no idea when. I text people to see how they are, but never respond when they ask me in return or ask to do things. I miss what I was, who I was. I miss happiness. I just want all of it again. I am my loudest voice, though. I will own my shit and advocate for myself if I have to. I just wish I had an actual support system like so many MS patients. It could have prevented so much. I'm still waiting for my tribe to find me, but until then, I will defend myself every time it's needed. I see you and hear you.

"In 3 days I will have my 10 year anniversary of the rape and I just don‘t know what to do. It‘s a national day where I live so this day has never been normal. It used to be a fun day where family and friends come together. Now it‘s a horrible day where family and friends come together. 

I don‘t even know what I expect from this post. If I need support or just room to vent. At the moment I don‘t know anything anymore. Maybe I just need the „I got you, I know how you feel.“ I have good friends and family and good therapists. But talking to them seems to make me feel even more alone at the moment. 

Why is this even a thing this anniversary? Every anniversary has been difficult but I‘ve been having anxiety about this day coming since like 3 years. Now it‘s 3 days ahead. 

And there’s so much, no one tells you about and if you tell others, you feel so damn crazy. Like, I still have the pants I wore that night. Those were my favorite pants. I felt very good in them. Now they‘re still packed in a bag in my home. I used to have the bag hidden in my closet, acting like nothing happened. Few years ago, i saw it, didn‘t know what was in this bag anymore, took the pants out, realized what pants those were and immediately threw them away, across my apartment and went throwing up. I wanted to get rid of them but just couldn‘t.. i couldn‘t touch them and I couldn‘t let go of them. Why? Why do I want to keep them? I‘ve put the bag in a corner in my bedroom (very unhealthy I know, I have to get rid of them.) it was the corner right next to the chair some have in their bedroom to throw their worn but now dirty clothes on to wear them again. It happened a few times where the clothes I three there slipped off the chair into the bag. Some clothes stayed there for weeks, I wasn‘t able to touch them. And when I finally were able to, I tried to only touch them with my fingernails, washing them directly, no other clothes in the washing machine, at too high temperatures and then I seemed to not get the dirt off of me again. I try to make a ritual today with the pants. Don’t know how yet but I need to get rid of them and as I can’t let them go, I guess I need a ritual. Just one thing of that stuff I feel very crazy about and haven‘t told anybody. 

The fact that he died 2 years ago doesn‘t keep me from seeing him everywhere. I flinch all the time, then I realize he‘s dead, then I realize there isn‘t even someone or if there is someone, this person doesn‘t even look similar to him. Additionally, he was a very close friend. Like a brother. He was a friend since I was 6. He got into a relationship with my sister when I was 15 and was a part of the family since then. So additionally to flinching because of bad trauma based emotions, I then flinch because of mourning emotions. After all, I still couldn‘t wrap my head around to fully hate him and it makes me sad knowing he‘s dead. 

There’s so much. I could write for hours. I just want to let it all go and live a normal life. After all this, I was in a relationship with a sociopath (very strange, but he died 2 years ago as well) I was very lucky to get out alive. Since then, noone has ever touched me. When I think about going on a date, I think about running away as far as possible. I lost all my 20s to trauma. I wanted to study and build a live. Now I don‘t even work anymore. I just can‘t. I can‘t sleep, I can‘t relax, I can‘t focus and so on… in 2 months I turn 29. I don‘t want to lose my 30s to trauma as well. 

I can‘t even keep my thoughts together. Sorry for wandering around like that. 

How did you get through the 10 years anniversary? And as I kinda unintentionally wrote about it, how did you go on dates again after experiences where you can‘t stand being touched anymore even though you want to and can‘t trust anyone anymore? What would I even tell about myself when all I had the last 10 years was trauma? 

But most importantly (after wandering around so much), how do you go through anniversaries?

Hi! I’m really sorry for what happened to you. It will be an anniversary for me too in a couple weeks, not the tenth though. I don’t really have any advice because I hate that day too. I did emdr therapy and it helped, you should try it if you haven’t. Maybe try and be with friends and family and go easy on yourself. You’re struggling, it’s okay if you’re not good on that day.

"Trigger: Mass shooting, guns, gangs, abandonment, children
Hi I am a after school teacher, each year I have to do the Alice program. It is an orientation about mass shootings at school. It gives me a PTSD warning every time I take it. I know it gives me someone to call,but I still have to get through the orientation( an I am scared to call the phone number). I am triggered very easily by mass shooting, putting kids in danger, and leaving kids behind. In the past I had been in type of these situations though they were gangs. I am thinking about doing the orientation at home cause I feel safe and it is an online orientation. Does anyone have any tips or tricks that I could stay calm during this orientation? Last year I got so scared from the orientation it made my PTSD symptoms started showing up more. That I finally went to the psychiatrist and got diagnosed with PTSD (some related and some non related). Right now thinking about the Alice program orientation is making my eye twitch.

"Hey, I have a lot of physical symptoms because of being in long term fight/flight/freeze.
I have so much tension in my body, always on guard, and it has caused my muscles to hurt a shit ton. I have been in chronic pain for years, and it’s sucks, cause I’m only 19F. I am supposed to be in the best years of my life, but this is stunting my ability to live my life. Every treatment I get, like a massage or going to the chiropractor only lasts for 1-2 days.
Do any of you have experience in treating the physical symptoms of your ptsd? 
I used to drink a lot, it really helped with the pain and tension, cause I finally relaxed completely. Because of my wonderful AA group, I’m 11 months sober. That’s great and all, but I don’t have a way to relax anymore. I wish there was some sort of muscle relaxer that wasn’t destructive. I know it exists, but I think my doctor might be sceptical to use it for ptsd.

Hot bath with loads of epsom salt and a tiny splash of baby oil. Epsom salt heals minor cuts and bruises, soothes pain, fatigue, tension and aches.

Yoga? You can do it for free by following a video online like Yoga with Adriene in the privacy of your own place. When you breathe deeply as you release muscle tension through stretching it can be very effective.

everything hurts so much. I feel scared all the time. I’m always jumping at the smallest sounds. a parental figure called me an embarrassment and compared my mental illness to a drug addict.  That parental figure made everything my fault and constantly invaded my privacy. They screamed at me for the smallest things and they called me fat. They made me feel insecure. I almost died when I was little and i just remember someone saying they didn’t want to save me because their clothes will get messed up. My ex cheated on me and lied to my face about it. I attempted suicide several times. I watched someone get beheaded. when I was a little kid someone was stabbed and I was blamed for it. My ex friend emotionally manipulated me and belittled me.

"I struggle really badly with nightmares. When I am not medicated I will go months without any good sleep and as you would expect my mental health and life falls apart because everything gets worse when you’re sleep deprived.

I am on 25-50mg although I often 100mg of Seroquel before bed.  It helps me get some sleep but I still wake up regularly throughout the night in a cold sweat. Sometimes the nightmares leave me off colour for the whole next day or days and I don’t always remember what happened in them (especially when on Seroquel) so I am someones more hyper vigilant and really uncomfortable or emotional without knowing what I dreamed of which triggered it.

I used to smoke weed before bed to lull myself to sleep otherwise I would be too hyper vigilant to relax, but it didn’t really help with the nightmares just helped me get to sleep or get back to sleep despite them.

I haven’t found a not medication way to stop the nightmares but I find controlling my sleeping environment helps me make the most of what little sleep I get. I try and make sure I have at least 14 hours in bed (which is hard as an adult, but otherwise I am not getting enough actual sleep between nightmares), I lock the doors and I sleep with my pets who can calm me down when I wake up throughout the night)."

"Hi everyone, 

So I've been having a therapist for almost a year now. I fell in love with her. She helped me alot and l wish to stay with her. Unfortunately that's not financially possible right now. There is an option to have therapy sessions from another organisation which is gonna get covered by my health insurance. I will go there but l notice that l miss my old therapist so much. It feels like I'm grieving about it. Now l asked her to come visit her and she agreed with that and l'm so happy to be able to see her again! I post this here to ask all of you what l could give her as a present. I have had some ideas like singing a song to her. Does anyone here have an idea of what would be a nice present to give her? 

Lots of love,
Pi❤️"	Ok-Piano6139	post	41.08986975110888	female	White	0.001198704936541617	na	na	na	3	ptsd	no prediction.

I hate to rain on the parade here, but it sounds like you might be a bit too attached to your therapist. The feeling of grief you experienced and the desire to give her a present indicate that you might have a potentially unhealthy level of attachment to her. People with trauma have attachment issues and often a therapist can start to fill in for a parental role that was not fulfilled as a child, or become a love object for the patient, neither of which are ideal. It's lovely that you're going to be able to visit her, but perhaps the present can just be your presence, and you can have a nice conversation over coffee and verbally express your appreciation or something since this is much more adult way to express affection than gift giving without a special occasion, which can make people feel awkward and may violate her professional boundaries and so on.

"I was diagnosed a few years ago and my triggers involve a few songs that I can no longer listen to without having an absolute meltdown. It's rare that these songs ever come up, mainly because I go out of my way to avoid it, so I feel like I've been able to mostly fly under the radar with my PTSD all these years. I don't want to live life like this forever because it feels like I'm constantly hiding or running away, but at the same time, I don't quite feel ready to bring up all these memories again.

My question is, at what point did you decide it was time to address your trauma and get help from a professional? Will I ever come to a point where I feel ready or do I just need to take a leap of faith?

On the day I experienced trauma I woke up feeling unusually tense and uneasy. Now I fear that whenever I have a similar bad feeling that something terrible is predetermined to happen. I stiffen up and become clumsy and paranoid about others' intentions. I feel like others are waiting for an opportunity to betray me. The event keeps replaying over and over in my mind, and growing in size, despite having little direct effect on my life anymore. I just wish I could have closure.

"I don't have a full answer for this, as I still struggle with this too. I try to look at things logically. I ask myself questions like: Are there actual signs the people will betray me? Are there any true red flags? Have they tried to hurt me in the past? And even if they did hurt me now, would it be severe or likely just a small thing? (Someone not giving a call when promised is not too bad, for example.)

Or for situations: Could this situation actually be dangerous or is there no real reason to worry? Can I relate this situation back to my past trauma and does that explain why I feel scared/worried?

It's still good to take your gut seriously, but also realise a lot of worry may be the PTSD. I try to explore my bad feeling and see if there's any logical basis or if it's just unlikely that something bad will happen. Usually if I get a bad gut feeling about an actually 'dangerous' person or situation, there's logical evidence to back it up. 

It can be hard though. Especially to still persist through the feeling when there's no logical reason to worry. You tend to be more likely to see the bad in something you expect to be bad, and you might be looking for proof to back up that feeling it's going to be bad. So objectively looking at things helps me the most. 

And realise that we really can't predict the future. PTSD makes us want to be prepared and safe from everything. Sometimes the things we worry about may turn out to actually be something good! And sometimes, we missed signs of danger and we end up in a bad situation. This is no fault of our own. It's just how the world works and to hide from everything is no way to live.

"I attempt compassion for my mind: oh, it's the PTSD trying it's best to protect me. My mind thinks if I can predict betrayal ahead of time I can protect myself. In reality, I am just pushing people away out of fear. All I really have control of is protecting myself. Betrayal or not, I trust myself to set boundaries to not let this person too close to me at the moment because I'm struggling today. 

I also wanted some closure. I'm not sure if this helps but when I wanted closure and could not get it, I at least told my story to a trusted person whom validated my response was valid, the absurdity of the betrayal was valid, my thoughts and emotions surrounding that was totally valid. ""maybe it was me, maybe I did something, maybe I missed something"" and having this confidant go ""uh, no, that person betrayed you. That is awful."""

I struggle with this too. It didn’t help that during the pandemic, I found myself on spiritually tik tok where everyone talks about manifesting and how we can basically think the life we want into existence. This made me very terrified because I often have intrusive thoughts of my husband dying or something happening to one of my dogs. I try to remind myself that my brain is trying to keep me safe and prepared for all potential situations. Worrying about something bad happening isn’t going to manifest it into existence.

"I’ve been introduced to Reddit some time ago. Always found it interesting to read. I honestly don’t know if posting here is my cry for help or need to share.

I’ve had motor accident back in May. Several bones broken, bleeding ear, concussion, and probably worst of all, vision issues of unknown source as my eyes are in perfect shape. Spent month in a hospital. 

On the top of it, left by my fiancée while I was still in hospital. My love, my shelter, my motivation….now gone.

Since then I do my best to recover my health, but my anxiety, which appeared shortly after trauma, keeps dragging me into the black hole. 
Scared of my future, scared of vision issues, missing deeply the person who was supposed to always be next to me, circling in fears, sometimes irrational, with no solution to break the dreadful spiral. I keep texting my ex love with my desperate ask for help, my accusations that she left me, my fatal state. She blocked me and I lost the hope to at least stay as friends. I’m hurt but it hurts me a lot that I hurt her with my words. I keep self-diagnosing. I keep worrying that my poor mental health stopped or prevented my recovery, or that it will damage my health, mostly vision. I keep worrying that negative thoughts will become true because I can’t think positively. I keep re-validating doctor diagnoses. I circle between rare strong moments and anxiety attacks. Despite all, I never give up seeing doctors, sometimes even more than I should.

Never had easy life but always been glad that it made me strong and confident person that I am. I don’t know what happened that I am broken now. How do I break the cycle? Is it deep anxiety, just chronic stress, PTSD? I do seek psychological help. Not effective? At least yet."

"> At this point I just don't even want to eat anymore.

Whatever you do, do not listen to this.

Do you live with other people?

You can always ask them to do a ""sanity test"" (as I've always called it) on food, and try a bite of yours to confirm it's all good.

I have anosmia and can genuinely eat spoiled food without realizing it. Asking other people ""does this smell funny to you?"" has been a life-saver.

Weed has such a strong taste. I doubt it'd be possible to eat too much without realizing quickly that it's there. Even with no sense of smell, the taste is overwhelming.

Unless that's what already happened somehow...?

If all else fails, you can always eat whole foods that have limited ingredients. Vegetables, meat, eggs, rice you cook yourself...the list goes on for a long long time.

Even if someone *wanted* to spike those, what would they do? Put the weed inside the egg shell? The skin of an apple? You can trust that a lot of foods are inherently safe.

I kinda worry that something is going on underneath this. Something like a developing eating disorder's irrational fear-compulsions towards food. Or OCD about contamination?

The first time I ever got properly high from weed was an absolutely traumatizing experience, no question. For years (actually more like a decade or more) I had such a terror about accidentally eating something weed-infused or accidentally getting a contact high from other people smoking or whatever. I still have no interest in doing any of that, as I know it's an awful experience for me. But luckily I'm not constantly paranoid about it anymore.

"I never smoke weed from someone I don't know. I use my presribed one.

Back in the day there was someone passing a joint, I had a panic attac and puked a lot.

It came out that it wasn't weed but spice. Since illegal weed is laced with dangerous substances I would never ask someone to have a smoke togheter.

"In my experience with platonic and familial relationships, people eventually just stop contacting me. So after a while I stopped trying.  It feels like I don't have something that others have for making lasting relationships. I'm so afraid of vulnerability, I don't want to let myself potentially be hurt again. Years upon years of isolation have caught up to me though. I've never been invited to a party, invited to just hang out, etc. Everyone else seems to have done those kinds of things. I regret not ""putting myself out there"" but it makes me feel so unsafe. Growing up kids never wanted to be friends with me and I have Autism, so socializing isn't something that comes naturally to me.

My therapist (trauma specialist) thinks I shouldn't expect permanent relationships with anyone. I mean I don't really see the point in relationships if you aren't bonding with people. Not saying all interactions are bonding but.. i mean come on just because I have a shitty family I will never find belongingness?

"It's not just you.  The truth is that is nothing is permanent.  People come and go.  Even if you find your life mate, one of you, some day, will leave.

It's hard to come to terms with this.

The idea of safety.  You have to find it within yourself.  That's what boundaries are about.

It's a struggle for everyone.

Maybe it's that some are more sensitive about it.

From what you say, that sense that you're not good enough seems pretty obvious.  You won't find resolution of that in others.  You have to find it in yourself.

I have worked for a long time to learn this.

If you would like to read my history it might help.  This alt chronicles the hell I went through during my divorce and all I've learned from it.

Yeah. I think the thing we (or maybe just me) lack is the ability to trust. People say that there's no love without trust and there's a lot of truth in that. People never feel fully comfortable around me because I can never be fully comfortable around others. It sucks. I am so alone that I often feel like I've lost or am slowly losing my mind.

"OP, you're definitely not alone in being lonely and being on the spectrum of autism.  Isolation due to PTSD would only compound this.  

This page, in its conclusion, offers this perspective:

>While being autistic may predispose an individual to loneliness, that doesn’t mean they will always be lonely.
>
>Unlearning what the world often says about autism and those who have it, learning to hone their unique skills, and trusting their worth can ultimately help to alleviate feelings of loneliness in autistic people.
>
>https://www.rootsofloneliness.com/autism-loneliness

I think the symptoms of autism and PTSD would overlap, presenting you with puzzles of emotions and situations to unravel.  You write authentically, brilliantly expressing your feelings.  You ARE reaching out.  You ARE participating with others.

For right now, it's from the safety of online anonymity, and were it me, I would view it as a positive step in the right direction.

Please try to hang onto the thought that the openness and friendliness *can* happen for you IRL, but will take time.  I don't have autism, but pre-internet age, it took *years* for me be able to speak about my trauma.

The most effective emotional tool I've found to strengthen my feelings of safety has been in learning to define my walls, limits and boundaries.  I'm no longer subject to the winds of what others may think or how they act, but settle these matters for myself.  It's not just what *they* need or want, but first, what I need or want.  I have to explicitly define the latter, to begin to understand the former, and decide if *I'm* compatible with *them*.  

OP, as a final word, I hope you find none of this hurtful, only helpful.   

I wish you well.


&nbsp;

Examples:

**Walls:** Permanent structures that are never to be breached. These involve rules like: I will never tolerate abuse, mental, emotional or physical. I will never intentionally harm another except in defense of self or others. I will never commit a crime or participate with those who do. I will never risk or sacrifice my home for immediate desires ...and so on.  This outer wall protects our *physical security*, not our *emotional safety*.  Emotional safety belongs in the realm of boundaries and limits.

**Limits:** How far I will go for someone else, and for *whom*?  Never breaching my walls, what am I willing to sacrifice and do for someone else? Yes, I'll run out in the middle of the night for a friend, and set with them at the hospital for hours and hours. Yes, I'll buy them groceries or pay for rent, electric or medical when tough times hit. No, no way am I buying illicit drugs or alcohol for an addict, but I'll take meals, shampoo, broom and mops, whatever, set with them when they need me. And so on.

**Boundaries:** How far do I let them in? Again, never breaching my wall, do I reveal my fawning skills?  Do I reveal my generosity, and if so, what *types* and *means* of generosity (time, emotional, financial) am I willing to reveal?  *In what circumstances* will I make these revelations - among strangers, friends, associates, family, to *brand new* people?  

Walls are permanent, unyielding and become stronger with time.  Limits and boundaries move, flex and breathe, but never beyond your ""comfort zone.""  It helps to keep evolving (written) lists, because as you heal and mature *(no one ever stops learning and maturing)*, so will your capacity and capabilities."	_SemperCuriosus_	reply	na	na	na	0.9955423474311829	weak	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"People don't know in the moment when you're holding part of yourself back. They know over time. It shows in how they shy away. Lose interest. Don't understand when you're honest about how you see things. 

It's a brutal reality that most people who haven't been through soul crushing adversity will never admit to.

They aren't held back, but we are. 

They won't say it's our fault, but we get treated like that anyways. 

Why?

Because they have an idea about how the world works, and we are people who have seen the other side of that fantasy falling apart. 

I don't care about the same things a normal person does. 

So much of it is a spiderweb of distractions that are trivial fixations used to reinforce a sense of purpose that I can never fully immerse myself in again. 

It's not cynicism on my part. 

More a hole in my heart where naive innocence and a simplistic worldview used to be.


Other people sense that, and they protect how they see themselves and the world by ignoring things that are uncomfortable truths. 

I didn't ask to be one of those uncomfortable truths but I am. 

They don't do it on purpose. 

Sometimes I can really connect with people, but it takes almost everything I have and it's not easy to maintain. 

One of my recovery goals is not giving up on finding a way to express myself authentically and finding meaningful connections that don't feel like I have to run a marathon to maintain. 

It's been getting better. Just so slowly that even I didn't notice. Time is the equalizer and part of me thinks the reason it's getting easier to connect is that people I talk to are getting older too.

I think thats an incredibly unfair thing said by your therapist.

I think the simple answer is that we do it because there's no choice but to keep going, as hard as things get we have to keep on pushing forward with the hope that one day we'll be able to look back at this experience as the difficult time in our lives before we were able to grow past it and things finally got better for us. 

One thing I've learned is that you can't rely on anyone else to process your trauma for you and rather unfairly, especially in cases of abuse from others, it's your personal task to heal it because you're the only one who can really do it. Therapists and other practitioners can help you sure, and they are valuable tools to use at times, but ultimately they're just assisting you in doing the internal work on yourself, if that makes any sense.  

It sounds like you've tried a number of things and they haven't worked so well, I've been there and it's demoralising at times. The good news is that trauma treatment is getting better by the day, and there are new options, and new therapies that are way more effective than before. Not all of them are likely to work on you, or any of us, but the chances that some will are pretty high nowadays. 

I think if you can accept that PTSD is a lifelong condition and stop trying to 'cure' it, but instead to manage it and develop the ability to live a relatively normal life despite it, then it becomes more manageable and the expectation of being totally healed won't be there to disappoint you. I actually think this is a good thing, because expecting each new treatment to heal you fully and then not getting those results is indeed depressing and I'm familiar with that, but if you look at it as one more step towards developing the skills needed to manage yourself long term, it allows you to remain hopeful in the face of all the difficulties. 

If you feel like sharing your story, or chatting, or just venting here then do it and don't beat yourself up for reaching out, it's a great thing and you'll find a lot of support here if you continue to do so."	FarCryFromHeaven	reply	na	na	na	0.9991521835327148	weak	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"I'm glad you reached out on here. I have felt the same way for the past few weeks. I feel like no one gets it. Everyone just looks at me confused like it's just going to pass. I don't know  what your symptoms are like. For me, I'm STUCK in fight or flight so I have not been able to eat. I can only drink nutrient shakes. I've lost lots of weight, I can't sleep without nightmares, I'm haunted. I can't focus even on a video, can't seem to find anything that brings me relief because my mind is constantly searching and scanning for something to be resolved so that the ""danger"" can be ""Fixed"". I think it's just the brain's way of trying to get through this and stop all these physiological reactions and feel ""safe"".

"I relate to this feeling a lot, i’ve feel like i’ve been becoming more and more unable to relate to the world and people since my parents passed(both were among my abusers) and im being forced to confront a lot of trauma.

I feel like the more i peel back and work on and understand the more stressed out and confused/fractured my mind feels. 
I think these feeling a make sense though because for so many years through my abuse denying it happened/it’s effects were critical survival skills. dealing with reality now feels very incoherent because it’s totally at odds with the narratives i had to tell myself to cope.

There are a lot of ways I really am the worst I’ve ever been mental health wise right now - but im trying to remind myself of what others are seeing.
I’m lucky to have some very supportive and articulate people in my life who have let me know in clear word they see me trying so hard to get better, or it’s incredible im doing this work now so young(still in my 20s), or the way they see me the see me feeling “lighter” or “glowing”.

I hope you can end up finding some grace for yourself - confronting trauma will always be ugly. 
One of my doctors explained to me once that your nervous system can’t really tell the difference between a flashback and an actual trauma - it’s reacting the exact same way with the same cascade of stress hormones.
it makes sense to me that if my body is feeling the same physiological stress that i went through during the worst moments of my life i would feel like i’m in the lowest point of my life.
but in reality looking at this past trauma, getting triggered, getting support from loved ones is doing me good that i’m not even fully realizing yet.
It’s rewiring associations of traumatic experiences with neglect, loneliness and danger into the ability to associated those traumas with the love and support of people who are there for me now."	FarCryFromHeaven	reply	na	na	na	0.9991521835327148	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

Even over 3 years later I still feel like this did a lot of therapy opened up got a lot off of my chest. Overall I am feeling better less triggers less sleepless nights less agitation and break down. But when trying to open up to my parents or my sister they say thing like be more positive stop being so negative. Your still letting him get to you. It doesn’t help it just makes it worse. All I’m looking for is someone who is willing to listen let me vent so to speak. Guess I have to continue doing so in my journals and on here.

I wrote this letter to myself in a moment I felt quite good. Ask yourself what might lead you to such a moment and then just start writing. I wrote stuff like 'hey, I know you feel like shit right now but you know it will end and you are a strong person, you can find a way to manage it.' maybe you can use some positive affirmations to encourage you to overcome a bad situation.

"I'm sorry the new medication can be intimidating, taking my first psychiatric med was scary. I want to reassure you, if it has really bad side effects, or if you don't like what it does, you can and should stop taking them and tell your doctor so you can try something different (either a different med, or non-med treatment)

What helps me with meds that seem scary is to treat it like a science experiment .

Try to notice and observe what is the same as usual. What is different? Is there other things you changed too? Did you eat a whole bucket of Orange Chicken before bed? Watch a scary movie that might affect the 'results' in addition to your meds?

For example:

* How does it feel to fall asleep?
* How do you feel when you wake up? Nervous, sweaty, groggy, confused?
* Do you remember any dreams? If you did, how did they feel? Scary, good, or strange?
* Did you have a morning panic attack? if you did, was it milder or more severe than usual?"	ProperIndication4903	reply	na	na	na	0.002022102475166321	strong	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"I take it as well. I'm on 3mg. I was on 4mg for a while, but I requested a reduction to 3 for similar reasons, sans a reluctance to take the med. Occasionally, I'll wake up slightly dizzy. In which case I will sit upright for 15 minutes or so and sip water to allow myself to get oriented. I also make sure to have a couple bottles of water next to my bed when I lay down for when I am falling asleep, in the event I wake up needing to rehydrate to prevent any risk of falling, and for when it's time to wake up to get ready for work. 


The Prazosin, for me, doesn't prevent nightmares. It does make them seem less intense to experience most of the time. So, recovering from them isn't as difficult as it was prior to being put on the medication. 


I think it would be smart to discuss this with your doctor and possibly inquire what they think about starting with a lower dose to let your body gradually find a place where it can tolerate any side effects while also offering you the relief that you were prescribed the medication to find. I hope you get this sorted out.

+1 on the above and due to it lowering blood pressure the dizzy -ness comes if you fly out of bed quickly or stand up fast.  If you have to get up in the middle of the night- just move calmly and slowly.  I sit up in bed first to get a gauge of how I’m doing and then make moves.

"Whether it’s the sexual abuse or bullying or even a breakup with the first girl I loved back in high school. My brain does not seem to turn off from being anxious. I truly believe that my brain is just stuck in the habits of being addicted to having panic attacks or severe bouts of anxiety. It’s really exhausting and infuriating, especially when you desperately need a good nights sleep or need to concentrate for that exam your employer requires you to pass. 

As much research as I’ve done I do understand that these are very primal instinctual reactions which our brains are hard wired for. We’re up against millions of years of evolution which has been extremely successful in keeping us safe but at the same time these painful memories seem to be far more trouble than it’s worth. I have a good therapist, and we’ve been working through a lot of these traumas but it’s like playing whack a mole. One goes quiet and another one pops up out of nowhere."

I've mostly just dealt with trust issues and panic attacks. Anxiety has been there too, but I don't feel addicted to it. If I had a feeling of addiction it'd definitely be self sabotage.	Capable_Coffee_7442	reply	na	na	na	0.9982686042785645	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"For me at least I’m not sure if it’s being addicted to anxiety or what. With my PTSD though I find myself doing anything and everything to keep myself occupied and focusing on a task to keep the thoughts of everything that happened at bay. When I don’t have anything to do and I’m just sitting idle or when life’s going well though, that’s when it kicks in. It’s like a whisper that just sets me on edge just waiting for the shoe to drop to drive me into that panic and fight or flight. I find myself being hyper vigilant and consciously avoiding anything that could cause that response but find my initial knee jerk reaction to go towards whatever stressor it it. Regardless I understand what you’re saying and agree entirely, it’s exhausting and frustrating beyond belief. 

I just keep telling myself it will get better eventually and I keep thinking about a line from Sleep Tokens new song/album Take Me Back To Eden: “No amount of self-sought fury will bring back the glory of innocence”. That line to me helps bring me back to a center point whenever I get angry about these feelings, what happened or what my brain does in response. Hopefully this made sense and isn’t just the mindless early morning ramblings of a dude in his late 20’s, just know you’re not alone and keep pressing on. This has to get better eventually."

I feel that way sometimes, for sure. Feeling calm is uncomfortable because then something bad will happen (this is an irrational thought, but in the moment it feels real and I'm working on challenging it). Things that don't bother other people, like super loud noises, yelling, sudden unexpected touching (like if someone touches your shoulder) make me highly anxious.

I have PTSD from seeing a lot of people die and doing a lot of crazy things myself, and I am having a lot of problems with my vision lately. Foggy, blurred vision, super itchy and always red. But I don't think the two are linked. PTSD is a psychological disorder from trauma and problems with your eyes are due to allergies and outside the body causes. If you are taking meds, which I am not, then it could be an artifact or aide effect of the meds, so you should see your prescribing doctor not Reddit. You can also have a neurological cause, not related to PTSD but something serious, so you still need to go to the doctor.	rock_angel_19	reply	na	na	na	0.9982682466506958	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

"I have cameras, it’s not like I hear voices in my head telling me that my neighbors think I’m nuts. I hear them over my cameras talking to each other about me. 

I’m in a row of 6 houses (rowhomes) from inside my house, looking at my front door, I have two houses to my right, and three houses to my left. 

I live in a very downtrodden and poor area, with lots of crime. I’m disabled. I’m prior military, and became increasingly agoraphobic when someone was shot in front of me in a drive by shooting out front of my house. I was really trying to heal prior to that from my military traumas but I don’t feel as if I can heal now because I don’t feel safe even in my house and I’m not financially well off to move. 

I don’t have a family or support system. Friends generally require me being comfortable leaving the house… 

I have had people show up dressed in clothing they have gotten at the local goodwill from different workplaces like BGE or VIVINT, where if you open up the door for them and you are a single female, home alone, they will push in the door, beat you up and rob you. This happened to two old friends of mine in this area. One was put in a coma, and the other… was dismembered and some of her body parts still haven’t been found. 

I have been watchful as a result of this, and If someone tries getting me to open my door without first trying to communicate with me through my video doorbell, I do get scared, and start screaming at them about why they can’t just use the doorbell. 

Well my neighbors are also not even mildly supportive. The corner house to my right, the female there is aware i am great at locating people. She showed me a video of a kid on a skateboard and asked if i could figure out who the kid was because they stole her son’s skateboard. Well… I got all the information about the kid, and called the schools police officer to report the theft as she asked, only to find out that she lied to me. Her sons skateboard had not been stolen. The guy she was dating came up on my porch one night telling me that I needed to have my guest move their vehicle because he felt entitled to the specific public parking spot that my guest was in. There were several other places open to park that night. The son decided to shoot pellet guns at my house and dog when i let my service dog outside. 

The house next to them was running an automotive business illegally from their backyard. They were painting cars without venting the tent. As a result, overspray got on my truck, and acetone was fed into my air conditioning unit, which killed my sugar glider. I had to complain to the city, though i decided to not sue them, they were pissed off because they got a hefty fine. These houses also have no soundproofing so i can hear conversations in the houses around me. That house in particular has two bedrooms, with 13 people living in the house, each who have 2 cars to drive. 

The house directly to my left has the newest community members in it. I get along with the girl there, and her 2 year old daughter, but the guy she calls her husband is awful. He is 17 years older then her. She’s confided in me that she feels trapped with him. He’s an alcoholic, and is a felon with gun related charges. I hear him screaming at her and his daughter all day long. He also has a lot of people coming over during the day, i think he may be dealing drugs out of his house because they always leave the house high… i also think he’s cheating on her but that’s not my place to get into. Since he has gun charges, he keeps talking to me like he served in the military, as if he outranked me. He speaks down to me, telling me that he’s leaving his wife and that i am obligated to clear space in my house for him to move into. He has propositioned me before, and i turned him down. He has screamed at my mother when she visited before, and he insults me, and anyone that I date as well. He doesn’t work, he just drinks all day, so i never see my female neighbor that i get along with, because she’s at work so much.

Next to him is an older man, 83 years old. He’s never served in the military but insists that women cannot serve so i must be lieing about my military service. He comes over periodically to rip my United States flag down, and likes to park his pro trump bumper stickered truck out front of my house. 

And next to him is a 69 year old man, who regularly tells me that as a woman, I am required to have sexual relations with him. Again, I turn him down, and I do just walk away, but it gets old.

I’m just tired of being called crazy by people who deflect from their own nonsensical behaviors. I act out when I perceive something as a threat. I think that’s more reasonable then acting entitled to a public parking spot, or sex with a 30 year old female, just because she’s a female. 

TLDR; my neighbors call me crazy, while acting erratic themselves."	Throwaway-Lemons-7	post	39.8130424473592	female	White	0.5550857782363892	na	na	na	42	ptsd	failed

"I'm not a woman, but I am a veteran as well with PTSD (amongst the chaotic spread of other stuff). 
I really do feel your pain

When I first got out, I was living in some pretty sketch apartments. My neighbors had 8 people living in a 2 person studio apartment. They'd beat their dog constantly and I'm pretty sure I heard a couple NDs as well. In that neighborhood, I saw a dude get literally swissed up by a dude in a van with an SMG. Two nights later, my neighbors 3 doors down took their domestic out into the parking lot. One of them hit the other in the head twice with a bat wrapped in barbed wire. This is all on top of hearing nightly screams and gunshots from the area. The TQs that IIF/CIF gave me were totally expended within the first month. Same with the outdated IFAK. Even driving around, I'd see some absolutely awful shit, like homeless people bleeding all over the place after knife fights, cops brutalizing the homeless for no apparent reason, and of course, finding random bullet holes in things like your car, walls, or your door. I always kept my head down, made anonymous police reports, and kept close tabs on everyone in that area. Only one or two people knew I was a DV before I got my DV plates (on my car), but they treated my like I didn't earn shit and I wasn't shit. Mind you, I'm white and I was living in gang territory, so of course I stuck out like a sore thumb driving my European car. 

I had to move and since my VA disability claim hadn't been processed in full yet (a couple went on deferral), I avidly told them that 1) I was about to become homeless if they didn't hurry their pathetic asses up (which is true) and 2) that the area is unsafe and I need that backpay to prove to new landlords I have enough to live at this nicer and safer location. It worked and the VA backpaid me the correct amount and I moved. 

Don't give up hope. See if you can reinforce your door and door frame with longer screws, new latches, and strong dowel rods for any windows on the first floor. Talk to your neighbors through that camera only unless you're obviously face to face, then I'd recommend deflecting and defusing in a quick manner so they don't pull you into a convo. I had a lot of issues with that because SMs are conditioned to listen to people's commentary in full due to the hierarchy of the military in general. You don't owe these people shit. I'd also recommend some good pepper spray and/or a strong taser. I'd say firearm or stabbing/slashing tool, but I know for a fact from living in a similar situation, people around there are not going to care why you shot or stabbed them. It might make everything worse. Mind you, home invasion is a different story. 

What I personally have found is that staying inside all day and being scared of people really fucks me up beyond the help of SSRIs, anxiety meds, and/or therapy. I'm not sure what you enjoy doing necessarily, but I personally love brewing beer, I love the College degree path I'm in, and I really enjoy getting out and trying new things like a new restaurant or a new taproom/brewery. I feel like getting out and going a decent ways away from your Apt will be great primarily because it'll show you that the world isn't so wild and it'll shake things up. Humans are by default, social creatures. Feed into that. One thing I found that always helps me with a sense of community and socialization (to an extent) is the r/PaymoneyWubby community. He's a hilarious Twitch streamer and his community is fucking wonderful. His community also has a discord where there's almost ALWAYS someone on the voice chat channels or video call channel.

Remember, you're strong as shit and a badass not just for what you're going through now, but what you did with the military as a woman. You're an inspiration to a lot of people :)

"I have PTSD from u.s mass shooting. Struggle with agoraphobia bc you know I just think bullets will come out of nowhere at anytime, I don’t want to be shot again, I’m going to die and I don’t trust humans. I sleep in my hallway sometimes bc no windows and I feel safe there. That’s my life. 

Fuck your neighbors. 

I get called crazy woman all the time and I’m pretty much a recluse. On the real, I’m a very sweet and fun human once you’re in the circle of trust. 

Majority of humans born don’t come out being  “ man I’m going to set out to be crazy, or have PTSD or have sobriety issues in life for funsies”

I’ve learned is how much this society lacks in empathy and immediately negatively judging something or someone they don’t understand/haven’t experienced. 

I was living in a violent drug neighborhood for awhile and I did everything I could to get out bc that environment was not helping my PTSD. I’m on disability. I lost everything and went into huge financial debt due to medical bills. It was very much a challenge financially to get out to somewhere safe and affordable bc those areas don’t exist when you’re poor and disabled, and general resources for help don’t exist or have years of waiting lists. 

I too put up cameras everywhere bc I had violent, meth addicted humans running around. Swat team was in our block at least 1 X month. It was terrifying.  I checked cameras just to walk out my door to go to appointments. Just living in a hyper-vigilant non- grounded state. Not good for PTSD. 

I’m sorry it’s not a healthy safe area for you around what’s supposed to be your safe haven. 

I do agree with some that have mentioned that I wouldn’t listen in, don’t engage, and don’t view unless there is a threat in your yard or you are “answering”  to a guest at your door/doorbell. Even then, if it isn’t someone you know- keep comms short. You control the engagement and comms. 

At the time I had ring cameras, and there was an option for an alarm. Sometimes I would just set the alarm off at people when they step in my yard or at my door when they were being shady as a deterrent. 

I didn’t feel safe engaging outside so I hit the internet for connection. I also envisioned how I would want to live my day out in the world if I had no safety threat and I turned that into a positive, fun virtual world in my home where I could. I needed to refocus away from others, hyper vigilance and the unsafe outside world to focus in  on myself and what makes me happy to be doing. 

Don’t engage with the news-it’s all doom and gloom. 
I started learning further culinary skills online and listen to podcasts while I cook. 
Joined some PTSD online groups/boards like this to vent and look for support just like you’re doing. 

I love all kinds of art. Hit the internet for that and those online communities. 

I won a vr headset by grace of luck. So many cool museums and places to experience through VR-not all games! Game changer for me. I’m so grateful for VR headset. 

Joined a virtual gym with some really amazing people from all over. Can’t work out safely outside- fuck it- I workout inside with some badass people online. 

I very much know it’s not healthy to not engage in a healthy manner with other humans, but Im disabled now, and have a very good reason not to trust the general public. 

I created my own world to cope and just be happy in and I don’t let any negative in.  My trauma taught me a very hard no b.s. line to be put down for anything-especially shitty humans that know right from wrong and I don’t engage with shit. 
Full fucking stop. 

My heart is with you.  PTSD is a beast and shitty humans don’t help.  Being on disability at my age and being female has def had some really shitty feeling deflating moments with some humans. 
Know there are some of us out here as strangers that get you. No words needed. 

In my head you’re a badass human- especially being female military. You got strength of all kinds and hella perseverance. You’re not crazy- you just have crazy running all around you in your hood that may cause you to loose your grounding at times. Keep doing fun shit for yourself and your dog and the caring people you do have in your life. 

I definitely know it is easier said than done, but do everything you can to get to a safer neighborhood  
Once I got out, it really helped me to decompress generally and I even got an amazing quiet nature public path I get to walk every day out of it which is awesome.

"i’m going to be honest if this is true, why would you care about the opinions of trashy insane people? like i fully get the social anxiety aspect of it, but when my neighbors act insane i’m just like “that’s nice crackhead” because like?? when people are complete trash who CAN’T even mask as normal, severely mentally ill and on hard drugs like the people you are describing, literally why would you internalize their delusions? when i moved into my building, the water wouldn’t run clear because the hot water heater thing was rusted. i called enough times they were forced to fix it after apparently no one else cared or just accepted their initial “keep running the water and eventually the pipes will be clear sorry about that” and didn’t keep on them to fix it so they had clean water. and my neighbor called me prissy and entitled and said the water doesn’t get as hot now. it’s because she was embarrassed about being a fucking slob who let her physically disabled daughter bathe in dirty water and that some girl in her twenties moved in and was like wtf why would you not call and complain??? are you drinking that water and washing your dishes with it too?? like literally why would i ever care about someone like that’s opinion when i’ve done nothing but get everyone in my building clean water AND new mailboxes with package lockers after our old ones were constantly breaking so much they wouldn’t deliver our mail and our packages were stolen. they bitched about having to pick up new mail keys once, but were fine with picking their mail up however often themselves from the post office? like it makes literally zero sense, they are just mad i will not live like that or pay a lease that isn’t being respected and the rental agency falls in line because legally they have to. they just want everyone to be as miserable as they have resigned themselves to being. i think they just wanted to keep stealing each other’s packages to be honest lol. but it like offends people when what’s good enough for them isn’t good enough for you - and what’s good enough for people in low income areas is dehumanizing and unsanitary to put it politely. 

again i get it sucks to live near people you don’t get along with. i’m more concerned with you being able to feel safe. but just try and understand that you don’t have to care about the opinions of people like that. like stop yourself and think - do these people have ANY right to criticize? what are they doing better than you, if anything? being friends with other weird people around them, probably cos they use drugs together? they probably don’t like your cameras because they’re worried their own activities are being recorded and resent the implication that they are sketchy people who commit crimes and have to be distrusted. they’re being resentful of you trying to keep yourself safe and being hyper-vigilant. that’s not like a real reason to criticize someone unless you’re being paranoid and talking about it to them all the time and being annoying. otherwise, they just are insulted themselves because the implication in their minds is “this is a bad area because of the people in it and therefore you need cameras, but WE ARE THE PEOPLE!” even though it isn’t personal. 

i would just focus on trying to move out of that area. those people are lost causes. just tell yourself you’re too good for them anyways and ignore them entirely."	Throwaway-Lemons-7	reply	na	na	na	0.5550857782363892	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"Wow, I really appreciate that. Yes, it sounds like you really do understand a bit of this. I’m in gang territory as well, and they are brawling over it. My issue is a bit backwards. I was sent no cost tdy from overseas duty, but was paying on a house overseas. Meanwhile where i was sent had no available housing so I was literally homeless. I went to a house i inherited for the first time and found that it had been hoarded out and was condemned. I lived in there but nothing worked. At first i couldn’t even open the door so i slept on the porch, as active duty military. 

My mother was alive, and insisted that i not sell that house because she grew up in it and the military insisted that i abide by my mothers wishes because i needed someone by me throughout the medboard. I put every cent and more into the house, and yes, i do find bulletholes everywhere. I had two in my front and back doors so i did replace them. They are steel now, so no one can get in that way. 

Now, I’m in so much debt that i can’t afford any house in my state with a Va loan. The only housing i can afford would be one that needs to be demolished and rebuilt, so I’d be homeless again. I’m terrified to move to a different state permanently as I have no idea what would be a good area vs bad area to live but i cannot handle another place like this.

"Trauma does that. We can be really fun people but sometimes it feels like people just want to see the side of us that’s scared and traumatized. I guess that seeing us be weak makes them feel powerful? 

I truly do wish the world worked differently. I wish that the ones who prey on others actually got justice and survivors/victims were able to move on completely. 

Again, it’s nice that you understand this, but also sad for me to think that other people struggle this same way as I do. 

I appreciate you taking the time to put this into words, and i do feel a lot less alone then I did before. I just hope we are both able to find peace and happiness to some extent again. 

I know I shouldn’t be concerned with what they say. My issue is that I try to mask my traumas so I do try to pay attention to what works and what doesn’t, but with that, there just seems to always be things I cannot change. I’m just trying to fit in, and it seems like the people around me don’t care to help me with that. As long as people threaten me, I’m just not going to be able to fit in.

"I get it. The best way to describe it is that these people are the ONLY in person interaction I even have. If you hear something so much, every day, you start to believe it, even when you are actively trying to dissuade yourself. Then, as other things happen, it validates the idea that these crackheads ARE the normal ones and that I am the one with the most problems. 

I got up some courage to go to the zoo this year, once. I was outside of the monkey exhibit and I saw a billboard with all the names of the monkeys on it, so i tried to figure out which one I was looking at. 

I heard a girl talking about which one it could be so I walked up next to her and said “that’s x! She was born on y day, making her z years old☺️”

Well the girl loudly remarked in the snarkiest voice I’ve heard in a while “look everyone! It’s x’s number one fan! 😂” while pointing at me. Everyone around her started laughing at me.

Things like that don’t really motivate me to meet new people and try to make friends. Instead, they feed into the idea that there is something so obviously wrong with me that making friends is just completely hopeless. 

Sometimes I think that I must be terribly ugly. I’ve been told I’m a bombshell, and people seem to want to proposition me frequently, but I start thinking, maybe it’s a lie. Maybe I’m just so ugly that people lie to me about it to console me. Maybe people proposition me so much because I’m just so unattractive that they think I’m desperate for that, especially these alcoholic elderly men. I mean, they’re drunk constantly so what would it matter what i look like anyway? 

All these things, these horrible things feed in to each other, so yea, I know that I shouldn’t care, but that’s all I hear in person."	Throwaway-Lemons-7	follow-up	na	na	na	0.5550857782363892	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

If you are housing insecure, I'd highly recommend letting the VA know. Just today when filing for new conditions I was asked two questions about homelessness. Give them a call, maybe they can help! Also, apply for SNAP/EBT as well as utility assistance. My states HSD office will give you a grant for gas and electric. I'm not sure about anything else, but right before the last few bucks was stripped from my account on bills, the HSD gave me x6 months of utility assistance, which was such a relief ON TOP of $280 a month in SNAP and Medicaid.

Also, I believe if you bank with a credit union like USAA or Navy Fed, I believe they also have options for assistance. 

As far as debt, I'm unsure of any guaranteed debt relief programs, but with the help of the VA, possibly a credit union that has strong military ties, and HSD, you'll be taken care of."	Throwaway-Lemons-7	reply	na	na	na	0.5550857782363892	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

If you have an Xbox, maybe we can play some fun co-op games. Once you start feeling more confident, then you can branch out. It's all about what you feel and what you need. Don't suffocate the feelings and signs your body is giving you :)

Btw, the VFW and Legions are all really great places to build on the community that would most be relatable to you.

"This is going to sound so so strange, but there's a guy in a movie we switched on at random who is the absolute spitting image of my abuser. Like the spitting image. It's not him, this movie came out years ago, but I nearly puked I genuinely thought it was him, and he was nice to the girl and I wanted to scream at them. I wanted to scream at them to punch him and to get him away from her. Jeez, this guy is exactly like him.

My current coping mechanism is to think about someone who's nice and makes me feel safe. Instead of being plagued by images of him, to force myself to think about someone else, but it's kind of tough to when this guy keeps popping up on the screen. I'm in a group so it's not like we can just switch it off though. If I kind of mentally replace those situations with someone who makes me feel safe, it sort of helps.

I just wanted to share a coping mechanism and it also gets my mind off when that guy will pop up on the tv again"	Complete-Mess4054	post	27.504219728863447	female	White	0.9918954968452454	na	na	na	3	ptsd	no prediction.
I’m sorry you’re dealing with that. When something on tv triggers me it’s either phrases that my shit mom said or arguments. Scenes of physical fights does that too.

I've had this happen a few times recently - all from one particular actor. I tried to focus on the slight differences in voice, looks, and behavior. Eventually, I was able to focus on a feature or two (nose, voice, etc.) that were different enough for me to recognize this is not the person who hurt me. I'm sorry this happened, especially in a group setting. Just thought I'd share my strategy as well.	Complete-Mess4054	reply	na	na	na	0.9918954968452454	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
It doesn't sound strange at all. Anything can trigger us, even a smell. I'm sorry you're going through that. I just had something like this happen recently. My brother sends random funny videos to brighten my day a lot throughout the day to help me with my days. He knows I struggle a lot lately with my flashbacks, but he doesn't know the full extent to what I flashback of. He thinks it mostly has to do with what I went through with my child. Anyways, a little bit ago He sent me what was supposed to be a funny video that turned into a total nightmare for me.  It triggered memories of a really bad attack I went through. And I didn't cope very well. I actually stopped talking for a couple of weeks. Went to therapy and diarrhea all over my therapist. But I wouldn't talk really much to anyone else. Kept myself. Wouldn't leave the house. Felt like I had just been attacked again. I'm still trying to process those feelings. And it's been about almost a month since the video.

for a long while i have been trying to find some kind of a space online to find community for my interests. and after months of kinda hopping around from thing to thing i'm starting to feel like im too afraid to settle anywhere and really establish myself for fear that my toxic (abusive?) ex partner will find me and tear me down in a public spectacle. maybe its not a reasonable thing to be worried about, or to let keep me from engaging with the things that i like in a public online space, but it haunts me every time i post somewhere. it almost feels silly to bring to this sub even though i know its bc of the trauma i experienced with this person. do any of you feel similar? in online spaces or outside them? terrified to put yourself out there bc someone who hurt you could have the power to destroy any success you find? or publicly expose every deeply personal detail you once trusted them with? just been thinking about it a lot	honeyscomb	post	18.6751055382219	male	White	0.9950582981109619	na	na	na	2	ptsd	no prediction.

"Long story short, my son's dad was highly abusive (physically, emotionally, etc) and pretty much dipped out once I got pregnant (even though he talked me out of taking Plan B, said he wanted to have a baby with me). He filed for legitimization from prison and we had a hearing. I had to get behind the witness stand and tell the judge about all of the abuse and how he hasn't ever even asked about my son or met him. It was really difficult telling a whole room full of people about the stuff he put me through, but I had to do it to protect my son. 
I've been absolutely terrified that he was going to get parental rights. I'm scared to even be around him myself, much less my child being around him.
I got my court order for the hearing and they denied him and said he abandoned his opportunity of interest. He can't even get rights through a paid attorney after he's released!!

"when i leave for school this fall, i think i will have to be done with my family. my parents abused my sister and i as kids, for which i forgave them after much work. things have been good between us except for my sister. when we were younger my parents used to be the ones who started arguments, but now as i recall instances in the last 10 years, it’s all been because of my sister. even my parents deeply dislike her. at first i used to attribute her behavior to our difficult upbringing. as a kid she would break my toys, rip my books. as a teenager she would be violent with my mom and call her slurs, which she still does as an adult. she’s ruined my birthdays, my graduations, and would go out of her way to somehow ruin my every happy moment. 

as adults we both started smoking weed to help with the anxiety/depression, but i didnt want to do it at my parents house because they disapprove and are bothered by the smell. well she would blackmail me into doing it with her despite the fact that i dont agree. she recently told my parents about my sex life despite knowing my parents are deeply conservative and catholic and wouldnt approve. i would never even think of sabotaging her like this. everything she’s done, she has never apologized. not once. she is never sorry. i’ve asked my parents why they deal with her and enable her behavior towards me as well as themselves. they claim she’s their child who they have a responsibility towards. well i don’t. unfortunately i think i will have to let go of my relationship with my parents that we were working on mending. it breaks my heart to give up on them."

"My (48F) husband (48M) of almost 25 years stole belongings from 4 different homes when we were 8 months behind in our electric bills, and so on; and I had no idea of the situation. Yes, I do work as well, but he was in charge of paying the bills.
Anyways, this has been 2 weeks ago, we're separated but he's still leaving at home, since we're broke a$$ people and need to share the car. 
So, I've been having non stop anxiety attacks, chest pains, out of breath, the whole nine yards, while re-thinking of what happened with us that day. (Cops barged in our home). 

He's going to therapy and church and working hard saying he'll never do it again. 
But still, I have anxiety attacks thinking that's gonna happen again. My 16-year-old is devastated by it, so thats all I think about. What if he does somenthibg stupid again and then he goes to prison and my kids will have to live with that? 

This is completely out of our reality, we've never been in trouble, and we're hinest and working people. He was a caring and great (as far as I knew) father and husband.

Thats why the trauma is even worse. I think about it over and over and over... especially imagining like it's already happening again; how can I control my negative thoughts? 

It's 3am, I've taken a sleeping pill but it's not even working tonight. It havibg an extra hard time tonight. 

It's so hard, any advice on tools to deal with those thoughts?

So I have really odd sleeping pattern's. I've done a lot of work on it for my own mental health and for those around me. I notice I often times can't sleep when others are sleeping. I think it may be a defensive tactic to watch out for them in their sleep while also keeping myself alert to any possible dangers. I live in a pretty safe area currently but it's still really hard to shake. It's been a problem in romantic relationships and even in my day to day (staying up all night then being brain dead at work, handling social interactions poorly etc.) I guess I'm just reaching out to see if anyone else exxperiences this and if so what sort of tactics I can use to try and deal with it. I don't use drugs anymore and rarely drink caffeine so I know its not a chemical issue.	strangenomad	post	35.78134481019708	male	White	0.9958986639976501	na	na	na	1	ptsd	no prediction.

"First time poster/recent lurker. I just wanted to come on here and ask if anyone has done a trauma therapy program? I also just need to vent to people that get it.

I've gotten to a point where I just can't deal with the constant triggers so I decided to go into a trauma therapy program. I started yesterday and it went terribly and I ended up leaving early. My at home therapist told me to try again today and I did. It went a better. I think I was overwhelmed with having to face my trauma and triggers and lay them out to new people. 

Does anyone have any tips on getting through these types of programs? I'm still a little anxious/fearful on everything and just need some reassurance.

"I did trauma therapy for two years with a counsellor. It’s really hard work but it’s worth it to keep going. Some days I dreaded my appointments, and some days I had nothing to talk about because things were going so well.

My biggest tip is to prepare before and after. Choose somewhere like a public park, your car, or a café that’s relaxing to sit and wait before your appointment. Make a playlist and listen to music that makes you feel empowered before you go in, or choose another activity like journaling, drawing or colouring. 

Make sure to reward yourself in some way for attending too, I suggest choosing something off of [this list of pleasant activities.](https://cornercanyoncounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pleasurable-Activities.pdf) This list is also great for positive distractions if you ever need it.

If you feel yourself getting too overwhelmed during an appointment, you can also ask for breaks to do [grounding exercises](https://www.healthline.com/health/grounding-techniques) during your appointments. They’re very helpful and will help you process things even easier. You can also do them before/after your appointment or at any other time.

I don't know much about the condition.  I know the reason this is happening to her. It's because of some childhood trauma that happened a little over 20 years ago. It just seems in the last couple weeks something's triggered it. She has forgotten and can't seem to remember things that have happened in the last couple of weeks but she's remembering stuff from her childhood. She seems more distant and absent minded and I she's usually so bubbly. I really hope she'll be alright. Is this something that can only be temporary? It seemed to have triggered while her husband and daughter were away for the weekend and when they came back she seems even more distant from her daughter even. Her husband had to kinda explain and show photos before she remembered their daughter properly. She's seeing a psychiatrist for the first time tomorrow which is a good step but I'm scared that I'll lose the my sister like I've known her over the last 30 years. Her husband just told me about all that earlier. Before they left he asked her if she wanted to say goodbye to me and she just shook her head and they left.

"Nice smelling lotion, special attention to grooming, positive and deliberate self talk, funny / cute videos, a good cozy book, a nice hike in a shady location, blowing bubbles, volunteering somewhere, dress up and take yourself out for a treat, visit the animal shelter and drop off some towels you can get cheap at goodwill + pet some lonely kitties, donate to a domestic violence shelter (they always need feminine hygiene products and underwear/ socks/ bras), get some cheap dollar store toys and leave them out (sans packaging) at a popular kids park with notes saying ""free for anyone who needs a smile today"" , visit a local museum with the goal to learn 3 new things, exercise, get an adult coloring book to color, put up a hummingbird feeder, take yourself to a movie, clean snd change your bedding then have a shower and take an amazing nap, call someone you dont talk to enough and let them know they matter, get your nails done, clean out a closet or drawer thats been ignored....


Sometimes its to self soothe, somethings are to distract from intrusive thoughts, sometimes its just to give someone else a boost that helps you feel connected and good about your day, somethings are just to take charge and fill your day with things you want rather than leaving the day to fall to chance and or be just any other day....sometimes its all the above.

"I practice *so many* things.

The drinking thing, I talk about it somewhere.  It was the *one* decision I hadn't made yet.  Every other decision had worked to the good.

This one, though, I didn't realize what it was doing to me.  For *months* my sleep had been awful; I'd been waking up from nightmares, screaming.  Waking my son when my babies were here.

Because I was drinking in the evenings when I got home from work.

Then  I read a book, something about top 10 management techniques for anxiety.  And it talked about brain chemistry and the effect of alcohol on anxiety.  Turns out that small amounts of alcohol help some chemical in the brain that deals with feelings of well-being.  But larger amounts deplete that chemical.

And, the liver processes alcohol 1 oz per hour,  and when it's done, the nerves wake up, excited.  So if, for example, I drank 6 oz of alcohol, 6 hours later I'd wake up, my nerves firing.

And, because sleep is interrupted, REM sequences become more intense--i.e., causing nightmares.

I realized I'd been doing this to *myself*.

After my last relationship, in which my ex dumped me out of the blue and then behaved about as horribly as I could imagine, I realized I couldn't keep looking to anyone else to love me.  I had to do it myself.  

And the only thing left I could do was quit drinking.

So I did.

The effect has been overwhelmingly positive.

I will trade evening struggles, tears, prayers to God, and lots of tea for what was happening to me in the middle of the night. 

No contest.  Because *this*, while unpleasant, is *nothing* like the nightmares and choking anxiety I was going through before.

I could drink a *little*, in the evenings.  Based on what I've been reading a small amount of wine each night actually helps heart patients (yep I had a heart attack through the hell I went through).  But I'm not ready to do that.

Right now I eat healthy; I've lost just at 50 lbs, my cardiologist says my bloodwork has the numbers of a 30 year old, and that if I keep doing what I'm doing it'll be as though I never had a heart attack.

At this age, 60, I'm almost in the best shape of my life.

I'm not going to risk that simply to cope with early evening sadness.

I don’t think it’s possible to forget it. You might feel waves of the pain from time to time like an embarrassing memory from childhood. You just can’t give it power. When you find your mind wandering, what helps me is to make a list of the people who didn’t hurt me and showed me love. I think the thought of my abuser being a coward who picked on me when I was vulnerable. He is nothing.

"I think about this a lot too. 
  

  
I think a lot about what restorative justice looks like and how to personally navigate a dynamic where it's possible that an abuser will never face true justice or accountability. I also think a lot about how that makes me feel. And oof. 
  

  
Like, how can I possibly grow and overcome those obstacles without succumbing to some sort of victim blaming, toxic positivity, and other narratives that make me feel like I need to surrender even more of myself? 
  

  
While not 100% applicable because there is nuance in every situation, when I think of solutions one of my first instincts is to ask myself, ""what would happen if this solution was prescribed to everyone, what are those implications, and does that change whether or not I believe that solution to be a good idea?"" 
  

  
The concept of forgiveness gets bandied about a lot in these spaces. And first and foremost, it's important to forgive ourselves. Until we forgive ourselves, it is nearly impossible to grow. But I would never tell someone to forgive their abuser or that they need to forgive their abuser. 
  

  
 My ex and her partners abused and manipulated me in some of the most horrific ways while also doing it to make me feel jealous. In some ways, it felt like they created a meme where they tried to normalize harming me in what I presume was an effort to provoke larger entities to do the same as a way to lessen their involvement and hide some other aspects of what they were doing.  However, they were never able to successfully provoke me to cross the line and boy howdy did they try. 'm not sure how many other victims they've had, but by my count, I have seen many others fail. Was the deck stacked in my favor? Well, if being a proponent of anti-violence, a survivor of CSA and bullying, being committed to leftist ideology, and someone who over-intellectualizes their trauma is a strength, then that's the only way I can see how it was. 

Hell, my abusers pretended that they were defending someone else as a way to justify why they were mistreating others while simultaneously turning a blind eye towards innocent people who died as a result of their activities. They knew that one of the people who they pretended was being protected that a relative of theirs was going to be murdered and they exploited that event for their own benefit. They also invaded the privacies of people who survived CSA as a way to provoke and exploit political corruption. They have no moral, ethical, or legal standing whatsoever and because they know this, they engaged in criminal activities that obfuscated those situations. They invented and created familial divisions where none existed until they got involved while playing a game I would call Schrodinger's government where they simultaneously pretend to be government assets and private citizens depending on what suits their needs at the time. They also exploited laws involving self-defense/vigilante justice while depending on government corruption to do most of their heavy lifting and pretending that innocuous acts are threatening -- when called out on it, they tacitly appeal to how the US military does it too while seemingly misunderstanding that I have never worked for, in, or supported the US military and I am just as critical of them as they are except I never feel the need to do terrible things to other people to make political statements. The Patriot Act and other similar statutes were specifically created to hold people like them accountable, regardless of how emboldened they feel or felt. Mob justice and vigilante justice has no place in a civil society and I don't and haven't cared how righteous they felt their causes were. 
  

  
I was accused of some pretty bad stuff and as a result, it felt like they tried to make me feel guilty about using my voice to support others. And I saw that same dynamic with my ex, where they tried to make her feel guilty for advocating for where her heart and mind felt, and I thought their behavior was wrong there too. Abusive people don't want their victims to change or be anything other than a perfect mirror that justifies why they targeted for abuse. In my research, I found that this is true in interpersonal dynamics, politics, and conflict theory. For instance, when one entity labels another an enemy or a belligerent, then nearly everything they do is seen through that lens. However, the consequence of that type of thought leads to becoming more like your enemy than anything else because dehumanization is often a root cause of conflict. We see these dynamics in policing methods, politics, war, and interpersonal relationships.
  

  
Yesterday, I had a great conversation with a friend about what rehabilitative justice means and what that looks like from an intersectional feminist perspective. While I 100% support accountability, I am somewhat critical of cancel culture. I believe that it has the ability to cheapen and allow the media to shape and define accountability and healing, I believe it has led to and will continue to lead to that dynamic being weaponized, and will result in a type of oversaturation that misses the target about what's important: dismantling rape culture and the patriarchy. The goal is to prevent further sexual abuse/abuse and holding accountable people and the power structures that enable and support it. And education is literally the only effective strategy. Cancel culture created a situation where those accused have joined forces and what do you know, it literally is the patriarchy getting together and absolving themselves of any wrongdoing while people who are already critical of the patriarchy often gain nothing. It ultimately creates an echo chamber that reinforces trial by media while offering the patriarchy a new tool to fight back by reinforcing the concept of allegation being indicative of guilt (see: Al Franken). It also allows the patriarchy to weaponize that dynamic by making false accusations and by using those dynamics as a wedge issue to distract from the larger issue of the normalization of rape culture. The reality is that there are a lot of abusive men out there and the goal is to prevent and reduce while holding abusers accountable and then limiting recidivism. Many of the same dynamics that contribute to the recidivism rate in the criminal justice system would also be applicable with this too. By all means, abusers should be held accountable but we should be mindful about how using the media introduces additional issues. 
  

  
When I'm not under physical duress, I'm much more levelheaded and even then, the extent of me ""acting out"" is bellicose rhetoric. Violence is not an option and I'm well aware of how self-defense can sometimes look like violence. I was bullied since childhood because I was taught that physically defending myself made me just as culpable as the people bullying me (I'm not saying I agree with that) and I was taught that I needed to be hit three times before I could defend myself (and I don't necessarily agree with that either). It didn't so much teach me as it conditioned me. I became much more adept at describing what was occurring and why it was wrong and how it was wrong and what the implications of its wrongness was than being able to ever physically protect myself. But, like I touched upon above, I recognized early on that I was being provoked which made me overthink everything (which helped) because it made me recognize that they clearly had the upper hand and were presumably attempting to weaponize my reaction. And I never gave them that satisfaction."	Separate_Attempt_848	reply	na	na	na	0.986240804195404	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"A short one today as I'm a bit overwhelmed myself but wanted to share a bit of advice as I struggle with this too - I say to myself in my head, clearly, quietly, strong but gentle: ""I am safe with myself and I can keep myself safe."" I don't think beyond that, I don't plan on what I'd do if I were suddenly in danger because then it spirals and I panic and lose that bit of clear control. So I calmly and firmly say that to myself to ground myself in the moment, and fuck, I'm starting to believe it. We need that clear headedness, that sure belief.

"I can't forget my abusers. I don't even want to. I believe a small portion of people are sociopathic and that other people who abuse are products of their environment. I was able to determine that based on what they believed which behavior of mine was unacceptable (like advocating for human rights), I could better attribute who my abusers were and their potential motives and why they seemed so keen on attempting to try to turn me into and project that I am a conservative, lethario, narcissistic hypocrite and how they could or would manipulate data to accomplish that. 
  

  
I can't forget my abusers because I don't and wouldn't want to give them that satisfaction. I don't believe and have never believed that people are all good or all bad. I try to refrain from hero worship as I believe it's self-defeating but there were and are traits and beliefs that my abusers have and had that are admirable and I can also see how they would believe that about me as well. 
  

  
I'm not a religious person but I find theology interesting. And it's also a topic that my ex was interested in too. In fact, almost everyone involved is somewhat, if only passively, interested in theology. I never liked the new testament salvation by faith loophole (and from my ignorant perspective, it begs the question as to why Satan was denied entrance into heaven -- but I guess Satan existed before Jesus?) because it suggests that people with lapsed faith can engage in ""sinful"" behavior without any recourse in the afterlife. And while I'm sure apologists would point to how people who are lapsed souls are not of the right mind, and that it would be inhumane for God to banish and judge souls who lacked the appropriate mental faculties, it speaks nothing of the possibility that people could be led to their faith in Jesus under similar circumstances. I definitely don't like the concept of salvation by acts and I find it to be incredibly problematic. But contemplating these ideas about justice and forgiveness and healing have helped me with how I approach that with my own. 
  

  
 I bring up these points because I do believe that the concept of hurt people hurt people has validity and that punitive justice perpetuates the cycle. I also feel that ""revenge"" is probably a natural response to injustice but that the success of humanity is contingent on overcoming biological impulse. 
  

  
Do some of my abusers know what they did is wrong? Yes. But it's irrelevant to my healing. I don't think my abusers expected me to actually start an NPO and educate myself on the things I educated myself on in response to being abused, and in a macabre way, that they may have to hear me go on diatribes like this is punishment enough. Hell, I'm sure some of my abusers support much of what I write about. 
  

  
Removing the active harm is the most important step in the healing process. When I was abused in the workplace by a manager who interfered with my professional development in the company I worked for, I healed by focusing on my own professional growth in a different industry. And other than occasionally thinking, ""if they could only see me now"", I rarely, if ever, thought about them. I spoke well about the company because it was the truth. The training I received, the standards they set, and my exposure to the many different aspects of their company had a profound impact on my professional development that I found were translatable to nearly any career. 
  

  
With the abusers I met in 2017, I spoke well of one of them until it became impossible to ignore that their involvement in my abuse was wilful and calculated. And the difficulty I faced was in forgiving myself for genuinely loving someone who wanted something from me that I could never give. So she seemingly loved the person who tried to and potentially killed me instead because she was possibly more interested in making a political statement about honor killing than any sense of real justice or morality. Do I often see people who resemble her and others? All the time. The only triggering aspect is the possibility and likelihood of a social engineering campaign regarding a bizarre form of forced exposure therapy but I don't believe their doppelgangers are related or anything beyond what I just described. 
  

  
I was abused from a young age and re-abused often. When it wasn't sexual or emotional abuse, it was being minimized, misunderstood, and treated as if I was incapable of understanding or that I was like a parrot. 
  

  
It wouldn't be inaccurate to say that my life and potential was taken from me prematurely. And I think what also hurt a lot was how the abusers I met in 2017, abused me at a point when I was at my peak -- i had obtained 100% financial freedom, with my wife we were finally homeowners (how great of a story of two people who never graduated college and forged our own paths without relying on the massive privilege of the families we came from, became homeowners in Chicago, and when we obtained that financial freedom, I began giving back by volunteering)! Losing all of that was humbling. And like I said to my metamour about our girlfriend, where her behavior felt like Sisyphus, I too found myself following the footsteps of Sisyphus. Something I find amusing is that when abusers recognize that their victims aren't the narcissists they projected, it briefly causes them to reflect on their behavior, at least in my instance, because it meant that their errors had downstream effects.

I really need help. I started smoking when I was 16 but managed to stop until years later when I found myself in an abusive relationship. It’s become my coping skill. I really want to quit but I can’t. It’s the only coping skill that slows down the pain and helps block the memories. Is there a better coping skill out there? I know things like this takes time but it’s so hard to get better when you have responsibilities.	Shoe-Chemical	post	21.424125143897427	female	White	0.0079238535836339	na	na	na	8	ptsd	no prediction.
I have smoked for 12 years, if not longer. I used to smoke tabbaco and weed as a coping mechanism. I managed to quit with a vaporizer. I bought nicotine, base, and a taste and mixed myself a vape liquid every week. This was hard to get used to, but I soon prefered the taste of vaping above tabacco. I alternated between vaping and smoking tobacco. As soon as I prefered the vape, I stopped buying tabacco. Every three months, I lowed my dosage of nicotine with 1mg at a time. This takes some time since I recommend starting at a 20mg mix. But slowly, but surely, I lowered and lowered the dosage. And I become more comfortable with lowering dosage quicker. For me, this was the way to go without going through withdrawal. I know now you think, but I need it to cope. You will learn that it was just a nasty habit and addiction that made you think you were coping. Just invest in the vape and stuff you need to mix the liquid. Dont buy shady stuff. Go for a geek vape vaporizer or something. Get your base, nicotine, and taste and start. The hardest part is thinking about it, not the doing part. And give yourself time to adjust.

"So... I tried to quit last year.. after 2 weeks I was worse off than I was after 2 days.. so.. I went to my Doctor and told him about the recent attempt at trying to quit and what I experienced. 
Full on shaking and trembling which only got worse from day 4-5.. by the 2 week mark I was an absolute mess and my old man came and threw a pouch at me, ""I can't watch you like this, it's not normal.. you need it"" or something to that effect was what he said.
Like you, I've quit before. Almost 12 months was the longest i'd managed before I did the old ""one won't hurt..."" Only to fall straight back into the habit. 

Anyway, my GP told me straight up ""quitting is not an option for you right now"". Rather perplexed by the unexpected response I asked him to elaborate on the advice. 
To give you some context; in the 12 months previously I'd quit smoking weed, quit drinking, as well as, all other substances I used for various reasons (only occasionally for recreational purposes), after going completely sober for the first time in my adult life, I ended up having a major psychotic breakdown which was induced by severe trauma that had gone unacknowledged, invalidated, and untreated for a 5+ years (after the last traumatic event). 
I checked myself into a psych clinic believing that I was becoming schizoaffective as I had misdiagnosed Bipolar I (obvs didn't know that at the time)... Id completely lost my grip on reality.. hearing voices, hallucinations, delusions, the whole lot. 
I got better for a brief period before I was the traumatized and began struggling with another bout of trauma induced psychosis..this was around the time I tried to quit. Not by choice, I simply couldn't afford to smoke so I figured why not quit, right? 

So my doctor explained with the amount of stress that my body was already suffering, the last thing that I should attempt to do was to attempt to quit nicotine. I'm paraphrasing but, essentially he explained that due to the current state of my body quitting smoking would just make me more sick. 

He told me, ""don't even think about trying to quit until I tell you it is safe to do so"" 

Hope that helps you..."	Shoe-Chemical	reply	na	na	na	0.0079238535836339	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
I've had problems with it all my life. When I finally decided to quit I called 1-800 quit now and received the patches. I had to return them and get lighter patches because they were too strong the ones they first gave me. Even so, my heart went out of rhythm using the patches so it was very dangerous for me to quit.

Agreed. I switched to e cigarettes years ago (ie, v2 & blue). Better than the more popular vaping. I had withdrawals but nothing like just quitting cigarettes cold turkey. This shit is hard. After 7 years on e cigarettes I backslid. Now I've tried to quit several times. But the Nicotine lozenges they make these days are gigantic instead of teeny tiny. And I CAN'T handle 5 days of mood swings with a toddler. I plan to look into v2 again. I physically felt a difference. I'll quit again off the ecigs. It's called harm reduction.

My abuser found my other Reddit account and called my parents and told them about my self harming habits stemming from her assaulting me.

"Hey buddy. I suffered with bed wetting for such a long time. Like from age 6 through 40. Turns out, I really struggled with sleep. Like I had obstructive sleep apnea in a bad bad way. My brain wouldn't shut down to dream and I was literally exhausted so as I would drift off to sleep the battle began whereas my exhausted body would fight to sleep. But my brain would wake up almost 2 times a minute to tell me to breathe. Such a terrible fight. Once I was put on CPAP, everything just changed! Started sleeping and the wetting stopped as I could actually wake up. Unfortunately with that said, the nightmares started. I never dreamt before CPAP. I'd never make it into REM stage.

I’m not saying never use anything at all. If you’re able to use something that genuinely makes you feel better, and I mean lessens your symptoms while not doing anything that could cause more problems for yourself or others, then I’m all for it. IME the problems really compile once you cause secondary traumas while you’re intoxicated… because then the cycle starts- for me it was “I’m drinking to calm my nerves from trauma A. Then I drank too much and still had a bad reaction to a trigger, and then came trauma B… so then I was drinking to cope with both, and then trauma C came around lol. It just keeps on going and makes it harder to stop. 

Maybe I should have been more specific, but I’m talking more about relying on it every day/night, and risking becoming dependent on it. That’s where I was adding that it trains your brain to depend on a substance to cope with negative emotions. Your minds threshold for dealing with things without the substance will get lower and lower, and it’s a very slippery slope towards needing it just to do every day things."

"My grandmother lives in literally the middle of nowhere. I lived there for a big chunk of my childhood. I love the farm and the wilderness but my father was deeply abusive.

He abuses his own mother verbally the most. He would yell at her that I didn't want to come to the farm because I didn't love her. Every. Single. Time. I didn't come out to see her.

I dropped going out to the country because my mother abandoned me and kept sending me to go out there with my father alone. She stopped coming because of his abuse but forced me to go which made the abuse worse.

I posted this story on here awhile ago and a few people tried to lecture me as I went on and on about how my grandmother literally had to hide the fact that I was talking to her on the phone from my abusive father as she was in a HOME(special care home in her region). He was yelling. He was talking down to her so fucking much.

The end of the line for me was when he found out I wanted to contact her more often, she told me that he was stealing her money to use for his bitch of a girlfriend and their ""new life"".

His girlfriend btw never met me and threatened me on the phone when I laughed at my deadbeat father after he called me after he kicked me out, after he insulted me, threatened me, in a sad and pathetic attempt to get my money. He didn't even know if I was homeless or not.

And yet, one person on here made extreme efforts to DM me and spam my replies saying I'm a horrible person for ""abandoning my grandmother"" with him when he is the ONLY financial provider for her, when I can't provide, when I don't have a vehicle, nor can I get out there on a regular basis, AND she refuses to move."

You ever heard of the Piss Guy greentext?

Someone on Reddit gets into a fight with someone else. They duke it out for weeks. In different subs. On different posts. 

Finally, the first guy looks at the other guy's profile.

And the first post he sees is activity in the sub where people drink their own piss.

The other guy is someone who spends his time. drinking. his own piss.

Dude #1 realizes that he's been arguing...for *weeks*...with a lunatic he'd never have made the mistake of engaging irl.

It's respectable to expect people online to be normal, decent folks who'll conduct themselves accordingly. 

But sometimes you just have to realize you've run into yet another Piss Guy.

And just sayin...I have a lot more respect for the OG Piss Guy than the complete douche who's harassing you over this.

Do what you need to do. You've suffered enough.

I hope your gran manages to move at some point and get out from under her monstrous son's thumb.

"Hey all,                             

My(20s M) (C)PTSD comes from several instances in my life with an unfortunate common thread of mistreatment done by women, mainly those with power over me such as my mother, ex girlfriend, older sister of a friend and manager at a job.                       
These events include SA when I was a kid, physical & emotional abuse and more.                 
I've been with my girlfriend for a while now and it's been largely great, however there's one giant issue that's making me insecure about our future: Her anger issues.                          

My girlfriend gets really really angry at even small things, due to her own past and past issues.            
This anger gets directed at the environment in outbursts, such as yelling at noone in particular, throwing stuff, punching walls, doors, refrigerators and the like. It's not healthy.                     
I've tried to ask her several times now to please bring this up with her therapist and work on this, but I feel like she's going to the office with a huge emotional bunker around herself and so nothing is really being achieved.                    

Her outbursts aren't healthy to begin with, but it's now to a point where I get paranoid and anxious about her being maybe angry at me. Not to mention my general anxiety spikes & relivings that happen whenever she's having an outburst with me present.                       

How do I bring this topic up with this following points in mind?                  
-Without making her feel like she's not allowed to feel angry.                  
-In a way to where she realizes the true extent of effect it has on me.                
-Making it clear that this is something she *has* to work on if we are to be together like how we both want?"	Strukkel_Hands	post	22.650375057214422	male	White	0.9863752722740173	na	na	na	10	ptsd	failed
Honestly couples counseling may be the way to go here. Because you can try your hardest to word it in a way that she won’t internalize as being an attack on her emotions/character but in reality you don’t know how she will respond no matter what you say.

I feel scared and unsafe when you kick and punch things and it’s happened enough times that I feel uneasy a lot of the time around you. There’s nothing wrong with feeling frustrated or mad, but the way you’re handling right now isn’t healthy for me to be around. Can we talk about some solutions?”

"Meh… don’t worry about it too much. I had a massive freak out in front of our neighbors in our old apartment complex and ended up in a very embarrassing spot being confronted by a neighbor about it. We argued, and she made a scene. Next thing I knew I overheard some neighbors talking about how ridiculous she was for doing that. 

My point is that you probably don’t look as weird as you think. An air horn is enough to spook anyone. Someone with PTSD is pretty likely to not do so well with it, and in todays world most people have some idea of what PTSD is vs what movies and things show. 

If they have anything to say about it, they’ll most likely try to encourage you to feel safer at home and maybe get help if you haven’t done so. 

My words might not help much right now, and I may not do the best at explaining it, but I don’t think you need to do anything unless you were pointing a gun at your neighbors… in which case you should apologize and try to be receptive to their concerns, which is fair tbh 🤷‍♂️"	Thedeadwalk69	reply	na	na	na	0.9988805651664734	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

I am a Social Psychologist but I have never been involved in therapy, so I am not a specialist by any means. But in my opinion, it is completely impossible to help someone who does not understand that they need help. You need to talk to him and determine to what extent he understands his situation, etc. and if he understands at all that he needs help. In my opinion, the best way is to explore knowledge yourself, reading 10-20 books on the subject allows anyone to gain distance from their own feelings, emotions, etc. And is the only guarantee of solving the problem. But if he does not see it at all then you are not able to help him.	grandstandtrash	reply	na	na	na	0.9966163039207458	no	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"I was waiting for someone else in the group to say something because it was really insensitive and way over simplifying the impacts of trauma. I understand the desire to want to distill things down into sayings like this and I think it’s totally great if that works for you, but sharing a sort of purity test on whether you “wallow or push on” as whether you’re a survivor or not isn’t great for the group imo. 

I decided to respond and I made sure to acknowledge that I can see the point they are trying to make, but that it’s not that simple. I took my time to explain that having ptsd, I have flashbacks and other symptoms that can be extremely difficult to manage and I do wallow. I probably will never “get over” what happened to me. That doesn’t take away from my strength and resilience. We are all survivors, healing is not linear and it’s important that as survivors, that we can identify with our strength and resilience even if we wallow, cry, feel miserable and stuck. The journey is unique for everyone so let’s not over simplify, let’s not put so much pressure on ourselves or others. 

They responded with being snarky about the amount I wrote and then reiterated what they had said, saying that’s what it comes down to, “nuances and excuses aside.”

Allowing myself to act more like a victim (stopping to feel, name, grieve, and soothe all those traumatic injuries instead of just ignoring and invalidating them) has enabled me to be a more resilient and fulfilled survivor (being more at choice in how I live my present day life where previously many of those choices would have been subconsciously dictated to me by unprocessed trauma responses)

"I live with symptoms of trauma daily. Some days I push through and keep moving. Others, like today, I let myself experience the emotions and get nothing else done. I know if I don't let myself have the bad days, they will eventually have me.

This person may have experienced something upsetting and feels like they have gotten over it. If they do ever really get stuck in trauma, it's going to be all the worse for them. Not only will they be going through trauma, they will also have their own ideas condemning them, telling them that they are not meeting an ideal that they think everyone should be able to meet."	seethroughBrain	reply	na	na	na	0.9907797574996948	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
"This person doesn't seem to be very sensitive to others. Whether they think they've finished the job of healing but it seems to me they have not even started yet. Precisely because they show themselves to be insensitive. 

If they are insensitive to others, maybe it's because they ollahave a thick armor and proud of it or because they actually are a wolf in sheep's clothing, meaning a narc in hiding. 

The absence of empathy being one of the main signs that someone is a narc. I congratulate you for remaining so humane and sensitive in your replies. Being able to connect is probably one of the big steps in healing and this person is not able to, very obviously. 

You seem to be much more able to do it (connecting) which tells a lot about your own level of being. Also, just the fact that you accept that maybe you'll be the way you are forever is another step forward too. Sometimes accepting where we are at is one of the best ways to change. I congratulate you for that and for being real.

If this was in an open group such as a Reddit group, it wouldn't be surprising that a narc would appear there and even becoming a moderator. I'm not saying they are a narc either, but I find their behavior very disturbing. Did you report them even if they are a moderator? Imposing one's beliefs or findings to others is not OK in my opinion. Boosting one's ego at the expense of others *is* abusive. 

I even thought they might be catfishing. Trying to find a potential victim who would want to be enlightened by their ""eiddom"". Maybe trying to find about a family member. (I won't say loved ones because they don't seem capable of much love).

"*sometimes. I think this is SOMETIMES true. However a victim is someone who just experienced a trauma, maybe in the healing process etc.

Some people don’t have the resources to get the help they need and are unable to heal successfully and thus are sadly stuck in a fashion.

People may even have access to resources but are so traumatized they don’t have the ability to process what they went through. 

There’s lots of nuance to trauma, victim, survivor status and a survivor was ultimately a victim at one point and I don’t feel there’s anything wrong with someone using either word because it’s just a quick way of explaining that you’ve gone through something.

It’s not always a woe is me thing.

Not saying it can’t be or people don’t do this but it’s better to err on the side of believing vs not given the damage denying it to someone who’s not just hamming it can do.

I forgot to add that they were kinda doing what I felt was “preying” on someone in the group(it’s a closed discord group, but kinda open in that we get new ppl fairly often) and that’s what actually compelled me to say something. They said their thing about victim/survivor in response to someone opening up about their struggles with self doubt and then told this person to ask themselves which one are they, a victim? Or a survivor? It gave me the creeps.

I am new to mental health groups and yes, wanting to make connection after feeling so lost for over a year, so that’s why I’m a bit chatty. 

I don’t know enough about narcissists, I didn’t even think this was something to look out for. I can definitely see it, though. I am probably going to go down a rabbit hole with this to learn more lol

 I had a similar experience during the pandemic. With all the confinement I missed being in contact with people, I wanted to be in a recovery / healing group so I joined a small ACOA session on Zoom. 

On the first session, the person heading that group suddenly became very abusive with me, berating me, suddenly saying I spoke more than others and what not when I was pretty sure other people had spoken more than me. They told others when their time was up and never did with me. Being the moderator they acted more like a schoolmaster, commenting on what everyone said, giving their evaluation and approval after each testimony and seemed to enjoy their leadership position and their posing as an expert. 

I, having had to dig so much, brought maybe a different perspective. And they didn't like it.

"Just wondering if anyone else feels this way or if this isn’t ptsd related at all. But I can’t connect with my memories and life experiences that took place before my trauma. Like I have the memories and can reach them fairly clearly, but I can never remember them on a personal level. Like it happened in another life. There’s before trauma time which has experiences and memories that I know are mine and I remember them clearly but I cannot connect to them the same way I can to the memories I’ve made post trauma. The memories I’ve made post trauma I don’t know how else to explain other Thani recognize them as my own and can connect to them and empathize with that version of myself on a deep level, easily. Anything prior to the trauma feels so distant like it wasn’t even me who experienced it, even what should be considered my best memories are so full now and I can’t connect to them on any deeper level than I would to a story told to me by a friend.

"I hate nudity in films and series, heck I hate seeing people naked. I have sexuality and love my SO being naked and sex. I just hate my SO's sexual attraction to people. I was explained that this is not something people choose it just happens. Was told that SO has been attracted to others during our relationship but never acted on it so that proves their love for me even more. While it makes me feel like I'm not enough or attractive enough. It makes me feel disgusted and not wanna have sex. Even when SO is going to a movie without me that involves a nude sex scene, it hurts me. Why would SO want to see that, knowing that it hurts me? So states that if I can't handle it I should not go but would love for me to come with. Why is this my problem? Why am I the only one not getting sexually attracted to people? But to my partner alone?   


 I have PTSD, I have abandonment issues, trust issues, I am not an insecure person. My trust issues are more towards getting to know people as friends. I trust my SO completely because we'll So is always brutally honest. People that know about this say I am crazy and that drives me crazy. I have had bad sexual encounters and have trauma from that. Almost got raped twice. But I don't see where this issue comes from. Why am I the only one that sees sexual attraction as a problem in a relationship?

"As someone with PTSD, *it fucks with your head*. That's the definition.

OP, if you have PTSD – your brain is not your friend, it is a little bitch that lies to you. The issue isn't other people experiencing sexual attraction, it's that you, on some level  have learned that your value and ability to be loved is tied intrinsically to being sexually attractive (it isn't, you have value just for being you) – and that you have to compete with everyone for your SO's attraction or they will leave. They won't leave you just because someone else is also attractive, but they might leave, and have reason to. The feelings you are having, the fear etc – are valid. But they're not well suited to the reality.

So we go to therapy and we work on it, because otherwise we end up hurting the people we love because we can't control our feelings, because we do not love ourselves very well, and when we use someone external to help control our feelings (like a SO) losing them because life of death.. and that's too much to ask of anyone.

I wiah you the best of luck, remember that our trauma isn't our fault, but it is our reaponaibility to do the work so we can be the best partners, lovers and friends we can to others, and ourselves."	Shammeths	reply	na	na	na	0.9979848861694336	no	no	no	na	ptsd	failed
"I think this could go a few ways and a therapist would be a very good call here. 

Different people have different experiences with sexual attraction, some people are like you, monogamous and demisexual. This means you require that emotional bond to experience attraction, and experience it with one person. Some people are like your SO, and experience sexual attraction due to physical preferences. These are both valid and normal.

Your SO can't necessarily control their feelings, but they can control their reactions to them. If they are either cheating or verbally over sharing with you about those feelings that make you uncomfortable, then those are boundaries that need to be communicated and set. Otherwise it just makes them a normal human with normal feelings, even if they're different from yours.

Your desire to control them going out to do basic life things like seeing a movie (and a lot of movies have nudity, and for most people it's nbd and we're not watching a 2 hour movie for a few seconds of boobs) isn't very healthy or fair to them and I suspect that that is coming from a place of trauma. This is where a therapist would be helpful, because finding out where it's coming from and why you're projecting your abusers or experiences onto them will take some time and effort."

"I experience something similar with my partner. What was helpful for me was to understand my sexuality better, and to underatand his. I don't feel sexual urges for people I am not emotionally connected to and I haven't experienced sexual attraction to anyone except my partner since being in a relationship. I am demisexual and sex, attraction and intimacy are all closely linked for me. I realized that I was projecting my experiences of attraction onto him and that is what was hurting me the most. 

In addition to the introspection and work to shift my perspective, it was really helpful for me to talk this out with my partner and to set up some boundaries that work for us. I know some of these boundaries may seem a little crazy to others, but it's what works for us and helps me feel more comfortable.  Nudity in a movie is a no (he closes his eyes or we talk about it before he goes with his friends), porn is a no, strip clubs is a no. And not over sharing things that are harmful/don't serve us and offering me validation when I need it is also very important. What other people think doesn't matter because it's what keeps us happy. I hope you will be able to talk to your partner and to work out some boundaries that work for both of you, and to understand each other better. 

As for therapy, I had a few really bad experiences with my first few therapists, and it took finding the right one who was patient and let me warm up to her before I started digging into some of these things I've mentioned here. It took a year before I would open up and it was all at my own pace. I hope you don't give up on finding the right therapist.

"This thread's a little old but I hope my contribution can help.

Might seem a bit odd, but the biggest thing that helped me was going to art school and having to draw live, naked models right in front of me. Yes, it's very uncomfortable at first, but eventually you start just looking at forms and seeing the human body for the shapes it makes and for it's sheer existence rather than an innate sexual object. 

I know art classes can be expensive, and heck maybe you don't even do it as a hobby, but I think just trying might help. You could google a nude model and attempt to draw it or observe it in a way that isn't sexual. Learning the science of anatomy might help as well. The human body looks the way it does because of what's inside of it and the functions for survival and life. It's quite amazing and beautiful actually.

"I understand this. I’m the same way minus the nudity in movies. It used to make me more uncomfortable, but these days nudity is in everything. I hate it when there’s a bunch of over the top sex scenes in things. I couldn’t get through Game of Thrones or Euphoria because it was so much to the point that it feels like watching porn. Those programs also involve rape scenes and teenage sex scenes which makes me horribly uncomfortable to watch. 

I’ve always been super modest. I don’t like wearing tight fitted or sexy things. Like the poster above said, I am probably demisexual because the only person I’ve ever had sex with is my husband, and we aren’t religious or anything like that. I’m good with it because I know that’s just who I am. I’m not going to be the girl walking around in a bikini, and that’s okay. What’s important to recognize is that though it makes me uncomfortable to show off skin, that’s not the case for everyone, and I can’t control what other people wear, only myself. 

In your relationship you can set healthy boundaries to help navigate this issue, but remember that these boundaries are for you, not your partner. Setting a boundary like “you can’t go to the movies because there’s nudity,” isn’t a boundary. It’s controlling your partner. Instead you can say that nudity makes me uncomfortable, so when we are together I’d prefer that we watch something that doesn’t have it. 

Your SO being attracted to other people doesn’t mean they are going to cheat or don’t think you’re attractive either. Unless they are really flaunting it and you suspect cheating, then it’s probably best to brush off those comments. Even though I am married, I’m not blind and I’ll point out people I find attractive to my husband, and he’ll do the same with me. He’s a human and I don’t expect that he just stopped noticing that other people are attractive when he got together with me. I know he loves me and I’m not worried. 

Since it causes you so much stress, you should talk to your partner about it and ask that they don’t talk about who they find attractive with you. Remind them that it isn’t because you’re accusing them of cheating. They can find other people attractive, but just don’t talk about it around you since it’s a trigger. Setting these boundaries and reminding yourself that nudity isn’t inherently sexual will help, but it will take practice to get comfortable with these things."

"We have boundaries like that. But I always feel shit about it. Oh cant watch this movie cause it has nudity in it or cant do that because there will be naked people on the beach. Sometimes like last weekend a conversation arises about something sexual and it ends up on how he has been attracted to others. Cause hes drunk (hes not drunk a lot dont want to make it come of that way) he ""forgets"" it hurts me or thinks it wont have much of an effect on me and urges me to tell that I have been attracted to others like that makes it ok. This happened last weekend and I was hurt about it. we both drunk a lot since it was his birthday. But ok. When I tell him im 5 tells other people that are with us. Like oh yeah she doenst wanna watch that. Which makes me so ashamed... im just surrounded by men and I hate it every time something like that happens.

"Its just so weird to me I have no memorie about mayor sexual trauma in my case. One time I was almost raped one of the guys let me go because I was crying and screaming out and his concious couldnt take it. Later in life he turned out to be the little brother of my best friend. We talked about it since he was just as shocked to see me as I him. He told me he was so sorry and he let me go because thats not who he is. I healed from that because of him. The other time I was almost taken from the streets and safed by another guy who saw it happening. So nothing mayor happened. No one ever cheated on me nor me on a partner. I dont get it.

My mom raised us not to be what she considered ""sluts"" but still I was alowed to be sexual and she didnt raise me to sexual maturity anyway. Neither did my dad. Mayne something happened when I was really really young. There has been speculations about my family. But those are nothing more than speculations."

"I feel that. I had to make a choice to tell my therapist things I'm not comfortable sharing. Trauma makes us feel a lot of shame about our normal feelings. It can really hurt to lay your cards on the table and be like ""I'm hurting the people I love because of my PTSD. Please help me learn how to stop."" But it really does help.

Like, it's normal to be insecure and untrusting, especially after sexual trauma (which is where my ptsd started). Like movies can be hard for me too, and I unpack it with my partner after we watch one that I feel perpetuates those rapist mindsets. Fuck ups and hang ups don't make anyone crazy, it just means we have things to learn and work on.

I've definitely had the same feelings about being bad for my partner and a desire to go off and be alone, but you and I both know that's not the answer. They chose us for a reason and I choose to respect and trust my partner enough to stick with it even when I feel like I'm awful for him.

"To me it sounds like he isn't respecting your boundaries appropriately or you need to clearly define additional boundaries as far as what is discussed with others.  If it's a boundary that he is truly respecting, he also would not guilt you about it. I don't want to assume that that is intentional so maybe it could benefit you to talk that over with him and tell him that you need your boundaries/personal elements of your relationship kept private. It really isn't anyone else's business. My husband has to ask permission before touching me, even to hold my hand, and he doesn't complain about that to others or make rude comments about it even though it might seem crazy for a couple that's been together for 8 years. It's what I need and he respects that. 

As for the drinking, everyone says and does stupid shit when they're drunk BUT that doesn't make him stomping all over your boundaries okay. It may be a mistake but that doesn't excuse it. Nor does it invalidate the hurt you feel. I hope he has taken responsibility for that. 

You aren't crazy or over reacting for having these needs. It also just sounds like he doesn't understand your sexuality and how you're wired and vice versa to a degree. I hope you're able to learn about each other's sexuality and to shift both of your perspectives on how you experience things.

I am not telling him to not go to the movie. Hell I am confining myself to the bedroom and not telling him anything.

"In my experience, it does hurt less when you've made progress in therapy. It's ongoing, but you get farther and farther in. I know with the trauma going back to childhood (me too) it takes a long time, so many neural pathways to smooth out and reassure. But it is doable. 

Have you had the same therapist the whole time? Are they a gender you're comfortable sharing things with? Have you tried different kinds of therapy? There are even things like ketamine assisted therapy for treatment resistant ptsd. I have switched therapists when my progress stagnates because everyone has a different approach and the new angle can bring on breakthroughs.

From experience, your belief that he thinks you're crazy is a trauma response. He probably wants to communicate and connect with you. He probably wants to resolve things because he wants to go out to a movie and also doesn't want to hurt you and believes a compromise is possible. He's probably frustrated and uncertain how to proceed. You're frustrated and don't know how to proceed.

It's not about the movie, really. It's about the pattern of shutting down when you feel shame or percieve rejection. It's about your perception of rejection where there is none. This is a very very normal part of ptsd and this is resolvable. It doesn't mean you're crazy, it just means you have a difficult thing to overcome. I've been through this too."

"Firstly, this feeling isn't permanent and will pass in a couple of hours to a day.

My name's joe. I also suffered from post traumatic episodes around the topic of sex and had serious issue with it. 

I'm not going to pretend that my experience is the same as yours. But I do want to let you know that emotional flashbacks can, and have occurred to many folk such as myself posting on reddit. The hopelessness/burning bridges spiral that is suggested from other comments that have been posted seems like you're going through a similar spiral that I have felt/seen in the past as well.

A good question to ask rn is:  ""is there is a positive outcome out of this?""

If the answer is no, take a moment away from the phone, internet, etc. And do something that either calms you down or take a nap (used to be my favorite ""reset button""). 

Afterwards come back to the problem in small chunks as to not overload yourself again. And if you feel like you are sliding back into one issue after another, keep note as that's how ptsd cascades back into locking you back into spirals, freezes, etc.

You are valuable, wanted, and folks care about you. Even if the folks are strangers on the internet or in person friends. Take it easy for a bit if you can bud, and hopefully time will smooth some things out."	Shammeths	reply	na	na	na	0.9979848861694336	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.

"Yeah. Especially when I'd talk to mom. She would scream at me and tell me to get over it. I was scared of ever bringing it up again. Basically, my trauma is from violence & fighting in the family. That started at 5 but It didn't involve me directly- I was the observer- I would fall to the floor, cover my ears, cry, call my grandma and tell her to help me, call the police, etc. I'd say ""dad please do something"" and he'd tell me to shut up. 

When I talk about these things to mom now, I try to make it sound like I find these memories funny. (""I remember one time dad hit my sister so hard with a belt, ha ha ha ha""). So that she doesn't scream at me for being sad over it. Neither of them remember any of it, which blows my mind. Mom said it didn't really phase her since she was abused severely in childhood & that was just a mild form of discipline to her. 

I'm sure that's one of the reasons I always think my trauma isn't bad enough. That I'm weak or dramatic for even being calling it trauma."	Lilypad244	reply	na	na	na	0.01704227924346924	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
I also have this problem. I often think about how the people in concentration camps had suffered and then I often feel like a way too sensitive person who doesn't have the right to experience strong negative emotions because of the domestic violence and bullying I experienced in childhood and teenage years. Because, there also have been good times. Not everything was bad. There are a lot people who had a way worse life or way worse conditions and then I come and complain.

"Long story short, I was almost strangled to death by my ex boyfriend. Since then, I get panic attacks and night terrors about the event. I confided in my brother and he said that I was over reacting. My brother knows my ex boyfriend and says he’s a good guy and that he didn’t mean for things to get out of hand. I am very sad that the first person I told about this doesn’t believe me. In fact, my ex boyfriend wants to get back with me and my brother is trying to help him. My brother keeps telling me “you’re going to miss out on a great guy if you keep acting like this.” I know I don’t need other people’s validation for my feelings but idk I just thought he would be there for me.

"@OP

In cases of abuse, often the abuser is always seen as a ""great"" person because they know how to act in public but as we know it's a different story once there's no one around. 

Then when you open your mouth it's such a night and day difference to the other person that they can't imagine the person being like that. 

If I (32m) was you I'd tell my brother to fuck off and stay out of my relationships and if he was such a great guy he can date him. 

My ex (f) was a southern bell (turned out she was a hillbilly) with 7 brothers. She could play the sweet and innocent little girl when she wanted to. Didn't matter she was 100 lbs soaking wet, she could punch harder than a man and she made use of that treating me like a punching bag. And because I loved her and knew my own strength (I was 240 lbs at the time) I couldn't bring myself to protect myself and instead lied to myself that I deserved it because if I didn't deserve it she wouldn't have done that to me. I was trapped in that hell for 3 years, and fell into a 10 year depression afterwards because she broke me. 

I couldn't tell anyone about it because it was such an alien concept to people that a woman can rape and abuse a man that they'd laugh. I was laughed out of the police precinct when I tried to get a domestic violence charge put on her. It didn't matter that I had a fishing hook (one I used for shark fishing) in my hip and I was bleeding there, what they were concerned about was if I did something. By the time I got to our house there was a cop car there and they were telling her what I tried doing and that if she even had a single bruise she could call them and they'd take me to jail.

That night and for a while afterwards she would tell me she was going to invite her friend over to slap box with her and laugh because I knew why she was saying it. 

It's not a question of gender equality, it's a fact that no one should be hitting anyone else. And sadly it's too often that the victims are made to stay silent.

Get pepper spray and tell your brother you don't want to see that sack of shit. Open your mouth and let others know what he did to you. 

Sorry but that stuff I don't play with. If my daughter ever told me someone touched her or hurt her I'd handle it personally and take the form of payment in teeth and blood. People don't just randomly accuse others of stuff like that. The ones that do that, do it often. Your brother should know how you are and who you are."

"You are correct.  
Dealing with my family has been - well - hard.

If you don't mind if I chat :). Yeah, outside of my near-death experience, which sucked, and tipped me to ptsd. I lived in nyc on 9-11. Lived down there. I almost lost my life, and lost two friends in that situation. 

You know - it was traumatic, for sure. But I did not have the words of what trauma was. Really, even 22yrs back the mental health establishment did not know. 

I deal with my stuff - as we all do. I actually find myself 'normal' in dealing with it. Maybe a better-point - when I see someone hurt - I am far more compassionate to them than my family/friends would be.

And one extra note: I was almost killed by a stranger (mugging/meth on his part). That is where my ptsd came from. Then Covid came. Not for nothing - don't get almost killed before a pandemic - because there are no medical services - as I learned. :)

No, less about me. But I really saw my family and friends for the first time in a situation that is outside of themselves. Things they cannot control. Well, that was me on 9-11 in NYC. That was me when this guy almost killed me. 

For my family/friends who have never had a traumatic experience - well, covid. And they freaked out. It was bad.

I asked my friends/classmates who we experienced 9-11 together - I asked them during the pandemic how they were doing. An honest question. Everone from that group said they were OK - BECAUSE of 9-11. 

Basically, they had been 'inoculated' by the stresses of 9-11, to simply deal with Covid.

And I think that speaks well to people who have ptsd - or stressed beyond what is normal.

I work with refugees. And oh man - their stories are off the chart. Yes, they do deal with ptsd. But their capacity to deal with things is far beyond what the average citizen in the U.S. or Canada deals with.

And maybe a positive spin on ptsd??? (not really) But the people who I meet with ptsd - well, they get it.

I was in 7th grade when 9/11 happened, and 5th grade(? Something around there… it’s foggy) when columbine happened. We were the closest school to columbine… but it never really stuck… at least not after joining the Marine Corps and being deployed as infantry. That was some crazy shit. 

I can’t imagine being in NYC when 9/11 happened. I mean, I had some idea of what I was going into… 9/11 on the other hand was totally unexpected. And then being assaulted like that… sheesh! I’m sorry you had to deal with all of that! 

I guess at the end of the day, fuck em… if our families don’t want to acknowledge that that might not fully understand what things were like for us, then why keep them around? 

I came home and within 2 years of being over there I had stage 3 cancer. Some of them still don’t care… so again, fuck em. 

We have lives to live, and we can’t erase that stuff. But we can live to the best of our abilities, and I think we’ve earned the right to do that with or without them.

I was having a hard time last night and in amongst the flashbacks of things that have actually happened to me, I flashed “back” (I don’t know if that’s even the right way to describe it) to something that’s never happened to me. Usually, I just relive the memories of what’s happened to me, with some slight variation, but this was completely unrelated to my experiences. It felt just like a flashback usually does for me, though. Has anyone else had similar experiences? This is the first time this has happened to me like this, and I’ve been dealing with this trauma for a while now.

For me it’s helpful to think of “healing” a little differently.  The word itself comes from the Old English “hǣlan” which literally means “restore to sound health.” So healing isn’t restoring oneself to a past or an original state. Rather, it’s taking the wound or wounds and making them healthy parts of you again. The wound can’t be cut off from the body or removed entirely. Instead those wounded pieces are incorporated back into the whole and they become part of what makes you the person you are. You’re not the same because you’re a little wiser, a little stronger, a little different for having endured what you have. Survivors are survivors because we have scars. Not in spite of them.

At some point in history a human being saw fire for the first time.  This is like fire.  It's going to hurt if you get too close to it but it will kill you if you don't learn how to handle it safely.

Erasing the past is how people like me get to be 60 and only recently realized I had PTSD my entire life.

Healing is about accepting that you can't erase the past. It's about loving the person who suffered from that trauma in the first place.

You have a right to all the emotions. I'm especially angry all the time, but I'm learning to remember what happened and how I'll never have the life I planned for and worked for. It's gone.

"This is how I think of it - Life changes you, no matter what happens.  Somethings we wish didn't happen, some things we are happy with. But, all of it is 'normal', even if the individual events are unusual; everyone experiences life events that change them, damage them, challenge them, are lucky or unfortunate.  Healing is finding a way to live with the changes you didn't want and don't like, and learning to embrace the person you are as a result.  It's about accepting where you are, and being the best you can be from there.

You don't have to be broken because of what happened to you, even if there is a long way back to being someone who can live comfortably in their own skin.  You still have all the value and all the worthiness you ever had, whatever came before. Wishing for 'normal' is a wish for things to have never changed, mourning the person you could have been under different circumstances.  There is no reason to think that person would be a better version of you - there's many people who have become better versions of themselves because they've experienced trauma.

I'm just able to be my true self now, much as I was as a child, until my family became frightened by how curious and open I was, so they shut that right the hell down.

"Trauma can be released but it goes step by step and it can take time. Fully accepting specific effects of trauma can be helpful. 

Nothing is ever broken that gets back to be exactly the same. Japanese have developed a very symbolic art to of repairing broken objects so they are whole again even if different. (Edit: it's kinsugi). 

Even if all trauma was lifted, we would be different because of experience and knowledge acquired. I don't think it's bad, in fact I would never want to go back to my old ignorant self.

"Hey guys, Im originally from Pennsylvania, just moved to Florida. This is unrelated to the trauma, but it's relevant to the situation. I really love living by the beach, I have more independence, and I was able to get a transfer to work down here too. There's one big issue.

Almost a month ago, I got into a car accident where the engine overheated and caught fire. I got out fine, but since then and since I've moved especially, my brains been wanting to revisit the place and re-drive over that same area, and while I can understand that it thinks it'll help in some way, I don't want to go back there. I love my life here, and I'm about to get in therapy for this, but I thought I'd ask the question;

Do these thoughts ever diminish? Will I be able to move on and grow from this without having to go back to PA to ""revisit"" this? Is this my brain trying to protect me?

Okay so I was asking myself that. And since you are too I think it is. I have also recently talked to several people who told me due to their trauma they had periods of time where they could barely walk and when they felt more distance from the trauma they felt better. I talked about some things I never got to really process from years ago and the unpacking it has left me feeling weak lethargic and irritable when people ask me to do things.

"I’m 24 years old and as long as I can remember my mother has had severe depression. I’ve learned more recently that she has also been diagnosed with PTSD. Her mental health issues has lead to past substance abuse issues and now that I’m an adult I can conceptualize that my sister and I have also experienced neglect and abuse being raised by our mother despite being gaslit into thinking that a lot of our conditions were normal ( they weren’t).

Now that I’m older my relationship with my mother has been pretty distant mostly because she isolates herself and doesn’t care to interact with people. 

This January, after not seeing her for nearly 2 years I discovered that she had been hoarding trash in her house for several months. Her landlord discovered this and kicked her out.

Seeing my mom she was unrecognizable. She had a lot of facial hair, extremely dark under eye circles, and her hair was matted and caked with grime.

I buzz cut her hair and helped her find a place after a little over a month. Bought her furniture. Helped her cover some debts. But since then she has seemed to fall back into old patterns and began hoarding again. I had to pay $1750 for someone to come in and clean again.

Tomorrow I’m taking her to the doctor to take a look at a rash she has had for the past 2 weeks. She said that it’s painful and she can’t shower with it. I’m fearful that this rash has manifested due to hygiene issues.

I just don’t know what to do to help her.

I’m thinking of trying to help her get health insurance and have her stay in an inpatient rehab for mental health issues for a couple of months so that she can begin to redevelop some structure and a sense of care for herself.

I’m not certain if I will be able to get her health insurance at this time of year but I hope I can make it happen. 

If anyone has any other ideas of what I can do to help my mom or resources available that might help me get her into a facility even without health insurance please share 💗"	Rarerestofbeans	post	45.919384145119224	female	White	0.9940381050109863	na	na	na	3	ptsd	no prediction.

Today I got into my first car accident. I don’t have a license, just a permit and my husband, the only available adult over 21 with a license I know, is in a different state. I was turning left on a route I always take. It was yield and I saw no cars coming. I was turning and halfway through the turn when I look over and see a large car not even slowing down just straight up going like 45-50 mph. I was T-boned. So many things running through my head like “oh no. I don’t have my actual license” “My beautiful and only car that I love so much is totaled” “my husband is going to be so upset that I got into an accident and ruined our only car.” “I don’t want to go to jail” “I did something wrong. I had to have done something wrong.” I asked the other driver what was going on at their end. They said they were trying to make it past the yellow light. I was the only one hurt and they had to call an ambulance to check me out. They brought me to the hospital just to be safe since I was starting to bruise very badly from the seatbelt which showed the other car hit mine with a lot of force. Doctors were worried about the arteries in my neck, my aorta valve being messed up, and if I had a broken knee since bruising showed up on it. Got CT scans and X-rays done. Everything turned up good and the doctors said tomorrow I will likely be in a lot of pain so I got some medicine for that. This whole time I’m just so scared it’s going to be another thing that causes PTSD. I already have been diagnosed for unrelated and different circumstances. The more I see the car hitting me and the more I hear the noise of impact the more I’m worried about how it’ll affect my mental state. I have a back up car thanks to someone close and while driving it home every time I had to go through an intersection I just saw what happened and heard the noise again. I’m not worried about insurance stuff and legal stuff. I’ve got that stuff being taken care of so for advice for that isn’t needed.	bad_wolf10203	post	20.873842009605497	female	White	0.9887590408325195	na	na	na	5	ptsd	no prediction.

"Tw: rape, abuse, strangulation, sex 




I wanna say it’s some sort of trauma bond.  He was my first boyfriend, he stole my virginity. I didn’t have a great childhood. I was groomed by older men online. I was 9. They could be anywhere from a few years older than me to 60. That’s when I developed a rape and bdsm kink. My first boyfriend also had those. But sometimes things would go a bit too far and I was scared. 

When we were in bed he choked me, which was fine, until it turned into less of choking and more of strangling. He only used one hand but I felt my body start shutting down from lack of oxygen. My vision went dark and blurry. He let go before I blacked out completely, but i would lay there for a minute paralyzed, recovering my vision. 

But then that happened when we weren’t in bed. The reason I flinch when I see sudden movement. I could be eating or watching tv and suddenly I’d be on the bed, a hand around my neck, and my vision slowly leaving me. This happened a few times. Maybe he was horny, but I definitely wasn’t. It was so random. I was scared. 

After that he mentioned twice how he wanted to rape my unconscious body in a field. He said no one would find me or hear me scream. I started wondering if he was capable of that. 

One time we were having sex. I was sore but I didn’t think anything of it. That day was the first time trying anal. I cried and we stopped. I cleaned up in the bathroom and I had fresh blood coming from my vagina. I wasn’t on my period. I asked him if I was bleeding during it and he said, “Yeah, a good amount.” He tore my pussy. Then used my blood as lube for anal. He was so proud when I told him he tore me. 

He dumped me after 3 months. Told me I made him feel like a bad person. I told some of my friends what happened afterwards. One went behind my back and told the counselor who told the cops who told my parents. I still loved him at the time. I defended him throughout the whole process. Even now in the back of my mind I want to defend him. He’s a good person. He made some mistakes but that’s okay. So did I. I went to project harmony and talked to them. There was a 50/50 chance he could get charged with strangulation. So I told the officer I didn’t want him to get in trouble. I had never felt more suicidal in my life. 

We still went to the same school. I had to see him in the hallways. That’s when I started using the walls to self harm. I’d dig my knuckles into them until I bled. Seeing him made my stomach churn. The next year I switched to an online school. But even now I still have nightmares I was sent back there. Where I see him in the halls and hurt myself all over again. 

3 years later and I still have rape nightmares. He’ll show up in my dreams as a background character. He won’t do anything, but once I see him I’ll feel the same fear I did 3 years ago. Now my rape dreams never involve him. They’re either random people or people close to me which sucks even more. Sometimes the dreams are brutal. I’ll be beaten, mutilated, or killed. They’re not nightmares anymore though. I feel nothing when they happen. I’ve grown used to them. 

I didn’t expect this to turn into a whole vent. Not to this extent. But I can’t stop thinking about him and I hate it. All I want to do it forget it. Which is probably why I have very bad long term and short term memory loss. It helped suppress my emotions but I can’t erase the facts. How do I get rid of him?"

"Have you talked to a doctor or a therapist? You don’t have to suffer there are treatments available. There are medications they give specifically for nightmares and also generally for ptsd. Also there are trauma therapies available. EMDR, somatic experiencing, etc. I’ve been in therapy for trauma for about 8 years now and it’s decreased the frequency of panic attacks and nightmares for me.

I’ve been in therapy for 7 years now. I’ve been on meds for 3. I recently switched from Zoloft to Prozac which is a lot better. I was in the psychward a second time last month. My therapist is trained in EMDR but she’s my third therapist and she’s new so we haven’t done anything yet. The third time I saw her I was sent to the hospital for suicidal plans.

My heart goes out to you and I'm so sorry!!  Fuck that shit indeed - that is some serious bullshit.  The healing process can feel like the world's worst rollercoaster.  Know that you're not alone and you'll experience that happiness again.  I'm trying EMDR, it's early yet so I don't know how it will work for me but there's good research behind it and it's worked really well for many people.  You do have to re-visit the traumatic experience to a certain extent but there are safeguards to help you through it.  The other thing that you could try when you're triggered is playing Tetris.  I've seen it mentioned by others and know that there's also good research behind it.  It's highly visual and demands spatial attention and that seems to help your brain process the trauma or package it into more manageable pieces.

I can't really explain it but do you ever I guess dissociate so much that you can't recall what happened whether something traumatic happened or not kind of like you have memory loss I guess or like you lose track of time? That and you can't remember who important people in your life are sometimes like even people you are close to? Sometimes you wander off in a dissociative state and don't know who or where you are. I started having similar episodes while in high school where I'd either stare off or sometimes even run off without even realizing it. I did also get in trouble for not telling them but in my head I was thinking I can't really help it. Well I guess sometimes I'm hyperfocused and wander off but I forget to tell people where I'mgoingor wander off in a hyperfocused trance and other times I do blackout.	seattleseahawks2014	post	23.48437591703788	male	White	0.9959049820899963	na	na	na	7	ptsd	no prediction.

"When bad shit just keeps happening, one right after another. Before I have time to process one trauma, I get blindsided by another.

I’ve been in therapy and seeing a psychiatrist since March of this year for trauma related to my abusive dad and all the crap he did to me before he left. I thought I was making some progress. I’m on Zoloft 125mg, propranolol 20mg twice a day, and Prazosin for PTSD nightmares. Then my brother died of an overdose last week after relapsing. Now it feels like the meds I’ve been on are useless…I might as well be popping tic tacs because they’re not doing anything anymore.

Hello - I’d like to say that I am so sorry for your loss. Grieving is such a hard process, and change can bring so many mixed emotions. Life altering events such as losing a loved one can definitely have a substantial impact on your mental health, and I definitely think that reaching out to a psychiatrist could help. It can be so frustrating to figure out which medications work best. Meds, therapy, inpatient hospitalization… always puts me through the ringer after all these years, so I think anger is extremely normal. In my experience it’s been about what is happening to me at that moment in time and also how my brain chemistry naturally is. I believe profession insight could be useful! Trauma and PSTD are mentally exhausting and you should be able to get the treatment you need. I am rooting for you! I am not in your shoes but I am hoping for the best for you and your healing.

I think this to an extent about the SA that traumatized me. I hear some stories and they sound “worse” than mine.

"one of the hallmark symptoms of ptsd is called minimization. Feeling like your trauma “wasn’t that bad” would be considered evidence that you DO have ptsd. 


also, although some experiences seem “worse” compared to others, there are so many factors that contribute to developing ptsd. One of the biggest factors is the amount of support, community or help you experienced (or didn’t experience) after your trauma. 

Two people could endure the same trauma but if person A has a comes from a culture that acknowledges mental health, has loving family to come home to, has 3 best friends to discuss it with, and has health insurance to see a therapist - this person is much less likely to develop ptsd than the person who has none of these things."

"I'm sorry this happened. You didn't deserve any of this. He should have been a safe person but he wasn't.


The hurt is not just his betrayal, it is also a fundamental trust in the world that has been broken. And all the emotions - the anger, the grief, they are a lot and overwhelming. In an ideal world you would have people around you who lift you up, who believe you, who keep you safe. I don't know your situation, but sometimes everythingbis less than ideal. 
 

The thing you are going through is an injury. It is deep, it is real, it can come back sometimes. 
It you fluctuate between ""it's ok"" and ""aaaargh!"" you are in an emotional flashback. You can look ghe term up. 


To.get out quicker, vagus nerve exercises and EFT tapping are ways to get back to baseline. As well as putting the face in ice cold water. But I know myseld that it isn't that easy.

I am in a similar place. I just listened to Stephen Stonsy’s webinar (part 1 and 2 on YouTube) about living and loving after betrayal and he points out that it’s easy to fall into victim mode after a betrayal, and while you absolutely are a victim and that pain is real, you have to decide how it serves you in life now. His advice is to rewrite your narrative focusing not on the past but on your core values and what gives you purpose and meaning now. I have been trying to do this, starting with a new narrative. I am not defined by the bad thing that happened to me, but by how strong I have been to overcome it. I am not unloveable or deserving of the pain because I never got an apology, the person who could not even apologize for their wrongdoings is too emotionally stunted and unhealthy to even make that gesture, and how sad for them. That is their failing, not mine.	anonheal	reply	na	na	na	0.9989894032478333	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed
"I'm right there with you. I won't go into my own various traumas in any form of detail (partly because I'm having a good day and don't want to wade into the murk of my subconscious), but there are a few that stay with me. They will show up the moment I drop my guard, the moment I'm no longer distracted by all the various coping mechanisms I've gathered over the years, and especially the moment I'm feeling weakest. Those times are written into my mind permanently, and I will never be rid of them. Some only show up at certain times of the year or when I'm suddenly reminded of them. Some are with me every breathing moment and can reduce me to emotionally incoherent babbling at any moment. And some are in between.

(Yes. I know. As I've told many a therapist, ""I don't have issues. I have *volumes*."")

So I know. I understand. I have many things that I will never heal from. The scars will stay with me for the rest of my life. And in some of those cases, it is because I will never have the closure that I need to close the book on my past.

"r/EMDR helped me a lot. 

But also, healing is not linear. Grief comes and goes in phases. You can be feeling fine for weeks, and then little reminders can break you. But it does get easier over time, those moments of reprieve will gradually get longer and longer, and one day you’ll realize you didn’t think of him all day, then all week, etc. 

When the brain develops thinking patterns, the synapses become fast tracks. They deepen, and other branches get pruned away. The more you think about something, the more connections you will make to it, and the more you will think about it. 

The key is to try to short-circuit that fast path. Mix it up with new routines. Change parts of your environment. Listen to new music, take new paths. When you catch yourself in a thought about him, have a new thought or goal in mind to switch your focus to instead. Over time, that well-worn path will become the one pruned instead, and gradually it will occupy less and less of your thought space.

"Just here to say, me too.

Its been 8 years since I moved out of my abusive parents home and to this day I am still stuck. :/ 

I try to do things little me would enjoy. Swimming, watching YouTube, also bluey (dont @ me lol), coloring. Just getting out of the house for a coffee. I find my triggers surface much more if I stay home a lot."	rock_angel_19	reply	na	na	na	0.9977439641952515	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	failed

I started using mushrooms ten years ago to help. They helped pull me out of a deep depression and suicidal ideation. I started with a decent amount dose-wise, went into nature, and had a trusted friend stick with me through the whole journey. It helped me remember why life was beautiful...I had deep belly laughs for the first time. I was also in therapy at the time, so that helped. It wasn't a cure-all, but it held me over for a decent amount of time. If you've never tried them I'd recommend: building a solid self-care routine like: journaling, meditation, therapy + a smaller dose. And of course, doing lots of research!

"Was robbed and beaten a few months ago in my neighborhood by a masked gunman. One of the hardest symptoms to shake has been a near-total inability to feel sexually excited/engaged — even when I try, even privately, even just in my head. I am married, and we have had intermittent struggles with intimacy before (where conflict in our relationship made it difficult), but this feels totally new; I’ve never felt so totally holistically shut down before, to the point where I think I’d be struggling no matter what romantic arrangement I was in.

I’ve been trying to do research, but everything I’ve found so far has been for survivors of sexual assault — a huge and worthy issue of course, just not mine. I’d already been in therapy, and am hopefully starting EMDR treatment this week. But if anyone knows of any helpful resources about dealing with this kind of dysfunction and/or how to talk to a partner about it I’d be really obliged."

Your body was violated and traumatized. You didn't need to be penetrated to be violated. You can't relax enough to be sexually aroused, and that's okay. It's gonna take time.	Malorkus22	reply	na	na	na	0.9979276657104492	weak	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"My trauma is also not SA but I have moved forward with my research because ideas and techniques are relatable.  I came across a person with a background in neuroscience and I'm finding her work very helpful. Caroline Spring in her name. I have listened to 3 of her podcasts so far....even though some of the topics do not pertain to me directly I still gathered valuable information.  She does a great job explaining why we can't ""just get over it"" too.  

I've also found some relatable info from Esther Perel.  She grew up in Belgium in a Jewish community after the war. She was influenced by people who embraced life and others that were merely alive. She also had podcasts etc.  

By the way, I am glad you were able to walk away from that gunman. Best to you"	Malorkus22	reply	na	na	na	0.9979276657104492	no	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
SA survivor responding, PTSD is any sort of turama, not exclusively sexual assault. This is 100% valid. It's the definition of turama. I hope your therapy helps, I'm sorry this happened to you.	Malorkus22	reply	na	na	na	0.9979276657104492	strong	no	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
"I've had the chance to listen to 2 more of Caroline springs podcast. I think it's so helpful.  I hope you listen to some.  
My trauma resulted in me having retroactive jealousy.  I went back decades and in a moment became increasingly upset by my husbands past sexual encounters.  I think my brain veered off into this as a way of avoiding the pain of the trauma.   I know it doesn't completely align with your story but since both of our traumas are outside of SA and boomerang into something sexually related, I'm happy to be an ear if you need one. Dm if you'd like. I am about 90% better and today I'm on a quest to try to stop intrusive thoughts. The last bit that hangs on.  Either wish you the best on your healing journey"	Malorkus22	reply	na	na	na	0.9979276657104492	weak	strong	no	na	ptsd	no prediction.
