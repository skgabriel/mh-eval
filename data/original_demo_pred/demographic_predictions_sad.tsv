"Reddit sucks. Who knew!

During my time as mod a bunch of shit has happened, and I thought I'd compile some of the interesting bits about /r/sad before I stop coming to this dumb site permanently:

Regarding the worst thing I ever saw posted here that didn't involve death or anything. I think it would have to be a post from over a decade ago I think where some guy posted, essentially having a mental breakdown, that he had just walked in on his girlfriend and his best friend losing their virginities to each other. I think it was so horrible because of how raw and recent the pain was. There was nothing anyone could say to help. I hope that dude is doing better now.

As for cross sub drama, I don't think we ever really had any. I remember some kid getting harassed over multiple subs and he eventually ended up on /r/sad where his thread got spammed the fuck out by whichever weirdos had been following him around all day. Reddit has always attracted social rejects and if you give them even a little bit of perceived power over someone else they hold onto it like their lives depend on it (see: most moderators lol). 

My personal favorite little anecdote is that whenever anything sad was posted that was related to the holocaust we'd start getting generic /pol/-tier comments as reports every time. I always wondered if random internet antisemites have some kind of bot that crawls the internet looking for holocaust mentions. Guess I'll never know.

Also of mention is all the swatting that used to get posted here. We tried to go without using automod for quite a while. Largely because I figured that a lot of people would make new accounts just to post here, and I didn't want those people to be turned away. But it turns out that if you don't have automod murking posts from new accounts that people will repeatedly post swatting attempts with burner accounts. After too many close calls I had no choice but to put automod on cleanup duty. So, if your post gets removed because your account is too new, don't blame me.

Speaking of janitor powers, we do have limits to what we can actually do. If someone's going to kill themselves unfortunately all we can do is hope that they don't. We don't have any special access to any information about people who post here. So while your panicked modmail is appreciated, we're just as powerless as you.

Enthusiastic modmail has been a mainstay on this sub the whole time I've modded it. But some of you all talked to us like we were the admins. I guess that's to be expected when a sub grows as much as this one has. Also, as a kind of a side note, if an OP is asking for ways to kill themselves and they specifically ask that you don't try and talk them out of it you probably shouldn't post a comment trying to talk them out of it. I know it's an impulse to help, but I doubt that anyone in these threads has ever been talked out of it after specifically asking not to be talked out of it. 

To wrap this up, when I first became a mod on this sub there were 223 subscribers. Now there's over 100k. More so, when I became a mod on this sub, the world was a very different place. Reddit was never really 'good', but it used to be different. And the world used to be different too. While a lone internet janitor like me cannot hope to change anything I can abuse my janitorial powers to force you all to read what kinda bullshit I have to say:

First, Reddit sucks and you shouldn't use it. I'm not telling you to protest I'm not telling you to have sex I'm not telling you to get a job or to bee urself or to find God. Just go do something else. You'll be much better off for it. And if there's some community here that you feel you'll miss too much, then go make it somewhere else. It has become a lot harder to stake it out on your own on the internet in the last twenty years, but it's still allowed. Go make a forum or a fediverse instance or a fucking neocities page. Who knows, maybe it'll be your website we're all bitching about in a decade. 

Second, the world is a horrible place. It's full of war, famine, disease, death, torture, and yes, an incredible amount of sadness. If you've stumbled across this little subreddit then you know that. You've felt the terrible sadness that permeates the human race even if all you've felt is speck of the whole.

Despite that, we have to face the saddest fact of all. Paradoxical as it might be we have to face the truth.

That despite the terrible terrible state of the world, it is also very beautiful.

It's easy to give up. It's very difficult to keep going. There is a comfort in hopelessness. It's a blanket to freeze to death in. I invite you, if you have any strength left to do it, to cast off the blanket, to light a fire instead. 

And if you can't, no hard feelings. No one can say that we didn't try. 

TLDR: Feel free to post whatever you want in this thread but be nice to each other >:( I will abuse my janitorial powers one last time to keep this up for a bit before fading back into the cyberial ether. Also feel free to ask any questions about modding this place."		post	18.590241315776833	male	White	0.9993268251419067	na	na	na	10	sad	no prediction.

"#The City in the Sea

Lo! Death has reared himself a throne
In a strange city lying alone
Far down within the dim West,
Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
Have gone to their eternal rest.
There shrines and palaces and towers
(Time-eaten towers and tremble not!)
Resemble nothing that is ours.
Around, by lifting winds forgot,
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.

No rays from the holy Heaven come down
On the long night-time of that town;
But light from out the lurid sea
Streams up the turrets silently—
Gleams up the pinnacles far and free—
Up domes—up spires—up kingly halls—
Up fanes—up Babylon-like walls—
Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers
Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers—
Up many and many a marvellous shrine
Whose wreathed friezes intertwine
The viol, the violet, and the vine.
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.
So blend the turrets and shadows there
That all seem pendulous in air,
While from a proud tower in the town
Death looks gigantically down.

There open fanes and gaping graves
Yawn level with the luminous waves;
But not the riches there that lie
In each idol’s diamond eye—
Not the gaily-jewelled dead
Tempt the waters from their bed;
For no ripples curl, alas!
Along that wilderness of glass—
No swellings tell that winds may be
Upon some far-off happier sea—
No heavings hint that winds have been
On seas less hideously serene.

But lo, a stir is in the air!
The wave—there is a movement there!
As if the towers had thrust aside,
In slightly sinking, the dull tide—
As if their tops had feebly given
A void within the filmy Heaven.
The waves have now a redder glow—
The hours are breathing faint and low—
And when, amid no earthly moans,
Down, down that town shall settle hence,
Hell, rising from a thousand thrones,
Shall do it reverence.

" There have been two incidents with me this week:  


1) 3 days back i saw four kids ganging up on a small pup, they were treating him like their toy, i could see from a distance the pup really wasn't enjoy that, they were dragging him back by his tail he was clearly scared but I couldn't afford to watch any much of that, i made them call their parents and admit what they were doing with the poor pup(1 of their parents was nearby) and to my surprise to an extent they were covering up their kid's wrong doing which got me so \*\*\*\*\*\* but since they were elder than me i couldn't say much but i atleast saved the pup.  


2) I saw a biker hit and run a dog early in the morning. they were rash driving, they knew they hit him but so heartless that they couldn't even stop to check whether they've hurt him or not i shouted with everything I've got in me, he didn't stop.  
the dog got a minor fracture by Gød's grace there wasn't much injury so i took him to the nearest vet. sadly i cannot look after him but i brought him under my building so i could go down and look after him and give him food from time to time  


BUT HOW CAN HUMANITY BE SO DEAD? DOES IT GIVE THEM A SENSE OF SUPIRIORITY TO TREAT ANIMALS THAT WAY? IF ANYONE FEELS THIS WAY in this community can come and fight me cos society really needs to get rid of such pieces of trash who hurt them who can't speak and who're weaker than them

"15th of may
my month
 the month about me and I received the gift I had been wishing for while blowing out my candles every year, my niece, my baby girl, My everlee rose. You made my world stop, you made the loud noise of the tragic world you where so crudely brought into quieter, you made me smile a genuine smile I hadn’t felt in what felt like forever, but on the 25th of may all that noise grew louder, almost to much for me to bare without you, although the waves continued to crash, the world continued to spin life went on, but how could it? When you where gone, you won’t be able to get your birthday wishes, when you never even got a birthday.


I am a 16 year old girl who deals with her grief by writing about it but I don’t want to burden my friends with it so I am posting this on reddit I have never posted on here before so I have no clue what I’m doing. But I lost my niece in may due to mal practice at the hospital which caused severe brain damage that caused her to not breathe properly on her own and little to no mobility so my sister and brother in law had to make the heavy hearted decision to take her off life support to give her a better life which was one not worth living she passed at 10 days old at 1:15pm on the 25/05/23 one and a half hours after being taken off the ventilator.

I'm having a particularly sad day. I just want to cry and take a depression nap. It's a parents birthday so they are coming over to get the obligatory gift (that I really didn't have the money for but I haven't had the balls to ask If we can please stop exchanging gifts as adults because it stresses me out and I am poor and they are not) and I'm just patiently waiting for them to hurry up and get here so I can pretend to be positive and rainbows and sunshine and then leave so I can be myself again and cry and sleep.

I don't know why I became ill but I didn't have to make such a big deal of it thinking that a few tablets of medication could change my brain. I missed the chance to spend time with the person I liked because all I did was sit at home saying my head hurts. I wasted all my money I have nothing left. I wasted over 2 years of my life. I'm ugly, old, ruined my brain through my own thinking. I will never be able to have healthy relationships. I will never feel happy or get a job. I have no money. I hate myself and the way I look now. I can't think anymore like I used to.	Critical-Bullfrog-10	post	33.48944866146059	female	White	0.9994801878929138	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

"I’m posting this just because i feel like i wanna vent. Before i continue i want to say a few disclaimers and some things i’ve been learning recently.

So first thing is that i don’t have a car and i have to walk to work. That drops my attractiveness down completely. I have a car i just have to get one of my parents to take me to the insurance place but they are always to busy or i’m working. Then Dad has to see i’m capable of driving before he gives me the car. I’ve been waiting for two years since HS graduation. Thats’s not what i wanted to get at though. 
As i was walking to work i was thinking of how painful it felt to be walking alongside traffic and me standing out so much. Trying to cross big ass streets. What did change my outlook was when i looked at some of the post women made in my situation and realized they literally have it 10x worse. 

 Like i’m not tryna be offensive or demean anyone i’m just telling about what learned today. As a guy who doesn’t get much intimacy it was very easy for me to underpin that amount of danger. I’ve always believed it was hard for women to walk alone but when i read into the stories it was way worse than i thought. Like i didn’t think that it went as far as dudes turning around in the opposite lane just to talk to women and give them a “free ride” Which we all know isn’t free. 

  Besides that though i mainly wanted to talk about my appearance just as a 20 Y/0. I hate that it’s like this but majority of times that i’m assumed to be like a kids age it’s always been by women. This rarely happens though as i get mad anxiety around women. For the thought of me not being enough. Men normally just treat me normal. 

  It’s not that i’m upset at these women. Despite what others on this subreddit may say about me i’m not a woman hating incel. If anything you can just say i’m scared of rejection. I know i don’t need to treat every interaction as a potential hook up but with me not having a car and being seen as a half man by people it’s kind of a barrier that i feel holds me back. I really don’t believe i’m just in my head. I guess i’m asking how am i able to get my social life in a better way. My life consists of walk to work work come home read/draw bed. 
I saw a guy flirting with a woman in the parking lot and he did it so effortless. He introduced me and she had called me a “lot boy” My title is “Lot Porter” I’m not at all mad at her i don’t think she meant any harm by it however it still hurt. I just want some opinions on how i can change my mindset on all of this. If you don’t feel you have an answer for me it’s cool."

"We’ve known each other for about two years now. We used to work together at a restaurant. I could tell that the very least he was attracted to me. But I think he and I were too shy to ask each other out. I haven’t seen him in 11 months. But we’re still social media friends and we will comment on each other’s posts sometimes. 

Today I went into a store after I left the gym. I was just kind of in my own world listening to my music on my headphones. Then when I get to the register, it’s my crush. We spoke very briefly about what each other was doing. Overall, I say it was a very pleasant conversation, but it was so awkward because I just got back from the gym and I was sweaty and to be honest, I gained weight.

"so recently, I decided that I was going to be online full-time as a high school junior taking all college classes...due to my mental health. High school was just not for me. I've taken college classes since freshman year of high school, so I am very used to college courses. I personally prefer college courses over high school courses. I am starting on the 21st and today was my high school's first day. I loved online during Covid. I thought that I will like it even more now since I don't have to hop on Google meets.

but some thing about seeing all my classmates posting about their first day of school, makes me very sad for some reason. I didn't think that I would be this sad crying over the high school I hated so much. I'm not crying because I'm anxious over taking these college classes(which shouldn't be that hard because they are GenEds high school grad requirements). it feels like some part of me is missing. I know it's good for me that I am starting college early but some part of me is nervous that I won't have a social life. And yes, I knew what I was getting into with online, but I didn't expect it to be this sad, especially after my grandpa leaving. I've been feeling very lonely because he has been living with me for the last two months. And he was the only person I really talked to during the summer because my parents are usually working. he just always chitchat with me. there was really no one else. I didn't expect that to hit me and I feel very lonely and sad inside now that he left.

even when my parents are at work, I'm the only child, so it was just me myself and I. But with him visiting us for the summer, I felt like I finally had someone to talk to. But with him leaving, I have a hard time adapting to the lonely life I had before with no one to communicate with.

I plan on getting a job soon, so I hope that will keep me busy. It's just I was use to my grandpa being with me and I was also used to being in high school for seven hours each day. now that I am a college student with a lot of time on my hands, I feel that a part of me is missing.

I also have a very hard time adjusting to new changes. I know that online will be better for my mental health in the future. but there's just been a lot going on with my grandpa leaving and have my grandma just passed away. Since I am online, I could travel to my home country. But that is also a very big decision if I want to commit to staying there for a few months.

usually, I prefer not being in a classroom with 30 other people. I hated high school and that was the main reason why I switched to online. I felt the high school classes were difficult for absolutely no reason and the school system was not for me. I think I am more sad about being so use to my summer with my grandpa then about high school.
With starting college full-time I feel that I am somewhat of an adult. That I am no longer a kid and maybe that's why I'm feeling sad about high school. But that's just one of the small reasons why I'm feeling this way, but I think my social life is what I'm concerned with the most. And the college thing is just to pile on top of what is really the main reason.

my mom did ask if I wanted to travel to my home country which 98% of my family lives there. didn't really think about it and just said no because I thought that would be very inconvenient. but now I am considering it. And I never really spent time with my family in Vietnam that much. I haven't seen them for four years now.
Maybe that's why I am so sad about my grandpa leaving because I never felt so connected with a family member that was not my mom."

and I’m afraid I’ll keep on doing it. Shattering my life into pieces, getting myself in too deep, just to claw myself out and do it again. I was once told of an art where people glue together broken plates and paint the glue gold, and that it’s so much more beautiful than a plate that hasn’t been broken, but how many times. How many times before I’m a shitty plate that glue can’t even fix. Too broken to be useful, to be eaten off of and enjoyed. I feel like I’m constantly on the brink of falling apart and ruining everything. I keep taking on additional risk that would make failing a substantially bigger deal. I’ve made so many sacrifices for something that i don’t think I can do, that i don’t think will happen, for something that is a fever dream. I sometimes think disappearing into oblivion would be a better option that continuing this farce, lying to myself and everyone around me that I will be something one day. I’m a burden on everyone around me, and I don’t know how much I can take, how much longer I can walk down this path knowing that it will end in nothing but failure.

Life is too short for depression or anything else to consume ur life, u might be viewing life in a negative way, u wont fond happiness by doing that. Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend.

"I've been struggling with depression on and off for the last 6 years. I've been trying to fight it a few times, but I always lost and got back to it for months... Until this year... I was making the most progress I've ever made. I was working out, was doing things that I liked, had plans to finally contact my friends from high school(Whom I haven't seen or spoken to for 5 years), and then bad luck striked me...I got a lot of health problems all of a sudden: Permanent Tinnitus, permanent hearing loss in one ear, I got severe ankle pain, and the latest and worst of them all: I started having headaches. These last the whole day. They are mild, but I just can't think.  I'm noticeably a lot dumber than before...I literally think I'm losing myself, who I am. The doctor just prescribed me some pills to reduce the headaches, which didn't help. I've got to say treating the other health problems wasn't cheap, and most of it was paid by my dad. My dad is one of the greatest dads out there. He has never denied me money when it comes to health or education, and has always supported me on whatever interest I pursue. He is not perfect,but then, who is? As I was saying, the treatments for the other health problems were expensive, and that's why I have tried to delay the next appointment with a doctor.. But the inability the headaches cause have become unbearable, so todya I finally  decided to ask my dad for some money to pay a visit to the doctor. I called him to work and he told me to ask my mom for money(who was at home) and tell her that ""he would transfer her back the money"". My mom is not the best mom out there...She is not the worst either, but I've got to think hard to find genuine acts of love from her to me or my sister.When it comes to money, she is very wary of it(always remembers who she lent or gave money to, and brings it up at random, even years later). So, I went to ask her for the money. It wasn't that much, around 30-40 dollars, although I've got to say she makes around 120 dollars per day, so its still a big part of what she earns. I told her what my father told me, but I mispronounced it, so she thought I was the one who was gonna pay her back. I corrected myself and said my father told me he would pay her back. She went to look for the money, and, before delivering me the bill, she asked me again: ""Are you sure your father told you?"" 

I broke inside.I felt like I was a client trying to get a loan from a bank, and she needed to make herself extra sure she would get the money back...I want to clarify I rarely ask her for money(once every 3-4 months at most), and when I do, it's always under the promise that my father would pay her back, which he does. This time it was more than usual, though, since I usually ask her for 5 or 10 dollars for transportation costs. But it still hurts that she had asked again. It's like she wouldn't have given me the money if my father didn't vouch for me... Which makes me sad because she is my mother, and although I'm kind of used to she not showing too much love, I still kind of expect deep inside that she does the few times I ask for her help.
I cried on the subway on the way to the doctor, and on the way back as well. It was a few years since the last time I cried, but I felt I couldn't just hold it this time. I just feel so bad right now, and I genuinely thought that, hadn't it been for my father's immense love to me all my life, I wouldn't be here today. I cried again when I thought that."	nhnsn	post	29.207224020948146	male	White	0.9946483969688416	na	na	na	2	sad	no prediction.

Your dad sounds like a real rock for you and that's awesome that you have someone like that in your corner. Being so grateful for your dad's love and support shows a very generous spirit!! It does suck feeling like you're not getting the same love or understanding from your mom though & it's natural to feel hurt by that. But maybe someday you'll get a chance to chat with her about how you feel. Still, you can always lean on the people who DO have your back.

"Just keep looking for another job, maybe try find something under the table if you can. Cash jobs. Being a uni student, I don’t know if you have things to sell exactly but you could try that for at least a little bit of cash. Someone suggested checking your school resources, that seems like an excellent idea. Maybe your school can help you get a job if you explain your situation. I’m not exactly sure how a go fund me works, maybe you could make one of those? 
I know this seems really tough right now, but if you can make through this small, rough patch it’ll all be worth it. I know I’m just a random person I want to see you succeed. Life is a little hard sometimes. Some of us don’t get the best childhoods but that’s what makes us strong. That doesn’t mean we aren’t worthy of love and acceptance. There’s so many things in life you haven’t experienced yet, life is such a gift. It’s a gift that we can see colours and hear music and other people’s laughter. We can feel things (even if it’s painful sometimes) we can smell things, taste things- that’s such a gift in itself.
If you’re worried about your weight, I can only suggest the obvious of working out and eating better. But also, it might just be your genetics or just your metabolism. Anyone who’s real, doesn’t care about your weight. If someone judges you for you weight, fuck em, who cares. I know it’s probably hard after all the things your horrible mother told you. But you need to start reminding yourself. You are smart, you are kind, you are strong, and you are a beautiful person. Hard times don’t make us less of person, we all go through things. 

I wanted to off myself when I was 16. I’m 20 now and I thank the universe every single day that I didn’t because. I still have really hard days, but I started working a little harder at taking care of myself (and still working on it, making yourself better is not a linear process). Life takes patience and practice. 

You mentioned that you have a tuition. Maybe you could find a shelter or something to stay in while still going to school as a last resort? Try everything you can first. Keep going! Keep fighting.

My recommendation is for you to try to find a job. You got fired from your last one but that doesn't mean you can't get another one. Any job, just something that allows you to scrape by. Focus on food and a place to live, make sure you have enough food to sustain yourself and find a spot that you can live safely whether that be an apartment, your mom's house, a friend's house, on the street in a safe covered area. Use your free time to exercise (only start this once you have a sustainable way to get food since you'll burn too much energy if you don't have food). Exercise should help you get in shape and help you mentally, then if possible, you could maybe look into getting a job in construction? This would keep you physically well and pay the bills. Or you could look for a job at a restaurant which most of the time can supply you with free food. Laying around doesn't help with anything sadly. If you work, you'll find a purpose and you won't have time to think of not wanting to live. It's not fun but it'll pay off down the line. There are so many opportunities for people to just survive, you may not end up wealthy but you'll get by which is better than dying. Get up, ask around for a job. Start there	SpaceV98	reply	na	na	na	0.9971240162849426	weak	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.

What type of phone do you have? Is it nice? If it is, I would recommend downgrading to something more simple. You don't need all the extra stuff, sell it, buy the most basic model that allows for calls and maybe some internet access and use the extra money to pay for food. That is all that I can give, advice. You are to determine whether you make these choices or not. I wish you the best	SpaceV98	reply	na	na	na	0.9971240162849426	no	no	strong	na	sad	no prediction.
I wasn't saying you were asking for a handout, just warning in case you were. You could also try to make things and sell em? And the point to live and suffer is because you won't get this chance again. You've lived this long, some aren't as lucky, live so their deaths weren't in vain. When you die, it's over. So try your best, you might be able to turn your life around. Many have. I'd suggest keep applying for ANY job. Look for obscure ones, look for ones people don't want like plumbing and cleaning houses. Right now, look for a job.

I just broke a three month self-harm free streak for not making volleyball tryouts. I know it doesn’t sound that serious but let me tell you the whole story first. Ever since I was just a young child I’ve been really bad at everything, I’m not smart. I don’t have talent and I’m just a loner over all, when I first started doing sports I chose gymnastic which I loved but it ended up giving me immense self esteem issues every time I did bad at a meet. I always tried so hard to impress my mom and be good enough for her but it was never enough, she was always disappointed and I just felt so bad for letting her down. I started volleyball last year after I quit gymnastics I started that up in hopes of doing better but instead I failed. First year I ended up being benched but this time I didn’t make it at all. Now I’m sitting here in my bed with blood dripping down my arm. My birthday was yesterday and all I did was go to tryouts and stay home, I haven’t talked to my dad in years and now we have a bad relationship. He sexually assaulted me when I was 9 and now I’m afraid of him as of result. I want to kill myself so bad but I can’t leave my cat and gecko behind. I just want to give up.	azrazpi3	post	18.150747906774978	female	White	0.9984793066978455	na	na	na	3	sad	failed

Hi. I’m so sorry you’ve been holding all of these things on your heart. I almost scrolled past this post, but I thought that you were a person whose life matters. I don’t know you, but your life matters to me. And I hope that you’ll be able to find something that gives you joy and is something you can’t measure yourself against. I hope you’ll be able to start your streak again and know that just because you broke the pattern doesn’t mean you’re a failure. Life is hard sometimes, and I want you to know that someone out there is thinking of you and hoping you will begin tomorrow morning 💛	azrazpi3	reply	na	na	na	0.9984793066978455	strong	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.
I'm truly sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time right now! Your feelings and struggles are valid and I'm glad you reached out to share them - it's brave to post online, for sure. Remember that setbacks don't define your worth or your potential... everyone faces challenges, and everyone deserves support when they need it. You can talk to someone about your feelings, maybe a trusted adult, a counselor, or helpline. You matter & your pain matters, and there are people who want to help and listen so that you don't have to carry around this burden solo.	azrazpi3	reply	na	na	na	0.9984793066978455	strong	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.

i keep seeing everyone around me finding other people to talk to- for example my roommate is hispanic and today i went out with her, and her and a group of ppl started talking to each other in spanish and idk spanish.
so i just stood there and was like so done! bc i have no one and everyone has ppl.
i have people at night that if i want to go to frats with, but i know that wont last. eventually they’ll find people with actually good personalities and who are interesting and i’ll be all alone.
and i dont this is going to change. in high school i had 2? friends and it was always sort of hard for me. i have bad social anxiety so interacting never feels natural or easy like it apparently does for everyone else.
i’m just really over it. i’m ready to drop out or just give up. it’s gonna be the rest of my life having no one 
i can’t even look forward to going home bc what then? i have two people. and it won’t be for months.

"I really don’t understand this. Well i guess i do i’m just tired of people always telling me to hold my head up and stop slouching and stuff. In general i get the point as i’m supposed to be confident in myself. But i find it hard. Lately the highlight of my days have been smoking and escaping my thoughts. Even though i know it’s a bad habit i can’t seem to kick it because i don’t really feel like i can. Or that my life will get better. I’ve been sober long periods of time for months at a time and i never can seem to find a reason to stop. 

As far as my slouching i always hold my head down everywhere i go. Everyone is telling me “put a smile on your face” and stuff like that. I’m very closed off from society. I don’t want to be but i am. I avoid women at my job whenever i can, I do talk with some of the guys there though. It seems there are so many things that are fighting me mentally. Therapy won’t help. I’ve tried that. I don’t go anywhere. My day consists of walk to work mom picks me i go home go to bed and do it again. Also on weekends i go no where either. Mom says oh she will take me but as a 20y/o guy there’s no where she can take me that i can actually feel happy about myself. 

Maybe i’m in a deep negative moment right now. But i don’t want to do this anymore. None of it matters. I keep getting thoughts of my ex and how she’s better than me in every way. Probably more better now that she dumped me. I see her car all over the place so it’s not like i can just forget.
I try the good habits like no fap…reading books…but nothing seems to work for me. I don’t want to go into why i don’t have a car. I just wish i was valued. It’s to the point i’m losing interest in drawing cars like i’ve been doing my whole life. I have thoughts that they’re not worth anything and i’m not either. 

I’m a young man and everyone seems to be above me everywhere i go. I’m tired of being the bottom of society. Women are expressing how men have beat them down and oppressed them when i don’t even get the chance to even talk to them. Even seeing a women i’m attracted to frustrates me. I don’t want to think about any of this anymore and asking for help more than likely won’t help. 

My passions for cars, art, success, and being the best man i can be are slipping away from me everyday. 
I see no reason to continue other than to make everyone else happy."

This is a real person btw: If you add a little bit of activity each day, dont go too fast, you will feel better, l like too run. Be proud of what u accomplish not mad at what u didn't. Life is too short for depression or anything else to consume ur life, u might be viewing life in a negative way, u wont fond happiness by doing that. Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, u can still talk to a therapist tho. Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible. Look up Bobby price guy health. U can’t end ur only life which is all u know by ending ur life. Don’t think mood swings last forever. Look for small thrills and the bigger ones will  come. Look up how to deal with Loneliness by dry creek ranger school. Suicide is a permanent fix to a temporary problem. U never need family, friends, a significant other, but u always need urself. Where is that motivational music video of you( not exercising or anything just u) Where's that out of body experience.Research Allah (peace be upon him)there is no stopping the game of life, u get one. Allah( peace be upon him)has a plan for u, stop comparing urself to that hoe, or anybody else this is ur game not theirs. Ur not at the bottom of society bro, trust me ur on ur way. U wont be happy be being cutoff, dont care about the attractive girls judging you slowly start making eye contact then talking to them just to talk to them dont pursue love.

"Gonna hit the ol reset button, are we? But you want the process to look natural, so that sort of implies that you don't want your death to make others sad or something.

Yeah, you can make it look pretty natural just by making it look like an accident of some kind, but it's really not going to save you from the suffering of existence or reality in general, and natural deaths are just as sad as unnatural ones.

We all have lives that are either worse than Nothing or better than Nothing, and in death we lose everything that defines us. If your life is truly one that's worse than Nothing, please don't hesitate to go. We don't want to trap you here in an existence that's only defined by suffering and sadness, that's the kind of thing demons would do to you! We want you to have a good life, and if a return to Nothing is an improvement on your current state, then go. Your body will be eaten by many things after you're gone, it's materials will be repurposed again and again and again, never ending because they'll never truly be destroyed, and with enough time your pattern will re-emerge again.

"For context: We had a rough family, an abusive father, so we're trying to heal our relationship with my mom, now that he's out of the picture. He still lingers here and there, but we are healing. 

We had 4 animals, 2 dogs Andy and Argos, (one of them is my fathers but he abandoned him here, amstaff) and 2 cats Mino (female) and Juro (male). Mino was my everything, she slept with me, sat in my lap during work hours, everything. I love Juro too, it's just not as strong as it was with my first ever cat. Juro also a saved cat from the street, so he tries to run out, we knew this, we had rules for going in and out.  It was really important, because these two made me live through everything that hapoened with the mental and physical abuse (sa, an stuff). 

One of my hobbies are computer games and streaming. At night, I would play at least 1 match of Valorant, and my mom loved to watch it.

So what happened, was, mom asked if I'm gonna play, so she could watch. It was a point in the day we waited for, bc it helped us rebond. I said yes, and started the game. She said she's gonna feed the dogs, se I've waited.

Some minutes later she opened the door, to ask, if I could play Reyna (a caracter) when she gets back. I said yes, with a laugh. Everything went soo good. And then it happened. I only heard her screaming ""Juro! JURO!""

Firstly I couldn't even register what happaned. For the first Juro I just took down my headset. For the second , I ran. He escaped before, but that was when the amstaff wasn't here, and he ended a stray cat before. I was horrified. I ran, and just heard ""Leave him, leave him!!!!""

I tried to catch the running dog, but it's an amstaff. You can't stop them. I bruised my knee, whil tryi g to stop him, and was face flattad to the ground. Mom ran and asked if I let the door open for the cat, and I cried out I didn't and she ran towards. It was chaos, but aomehow, we managed to get my cat inside, from his jaws. Mom had to kick the cat inside. He couldn't really walk. I panicked. I shouted for her to call the doctors, but i was late. I saw blood, and was mortified, but mom made me sure it was just her nails. I cried and cried, and tried to hold my cat. After an hour calling and begging, one veterinarian who said no to me, said yes to mom. It was after midnight. We ran with the cat, and she said he's okay, but needs an xray the next day. So we went to our basic vet, and he said he can have surgery, but it's expensive, or could heal on it's own, but would be really painful, and who knows how would he heal. Also would be so mucb longer.

Mom was angry at herself, so she said, she would pay for the surgery. We wanted the best, and ended up with the worst. After the surgery, everyzhing seemed fine. But ha licked the scab, so he had more time off. One time, most likely from the vet, he got cat flue. Luckily, he got through, but my other cat got it too. She was never ill, and while Juro didn't want to eat, Mino ate, and drank, and was good besides some fever and sneezes.

We were worried ofc, but hopeful, bc she seemed fine. She wasn't. Almost a month hapoened, Mino was ill for a week, I had a convention, so I went away for the weekend. I came back on sunday, and she was in BAD shape. Nothing like friday when I went away. She didn't eat, but drank, that was a good sign. We went to the doctor with her in the morning. She started to drool, and so drinking was nonexistent. And in the car, while my mom went for the soctor she had her first seizure. It was a really bad sign. I ran with her, and the doctors took some blood. It was really bad. They tought she had cancer, but couldn't know for sure. Her blood separeted into two sections. They said she needed transplant, so we had to go back in the afternoon when she calmed down (she could die from stress at that point). We went home, I tried to calm her, feed her, make her drink. We went back, and they said we could asj for test, but that would be expensive too, and there's little chance she could survive until. I didn't care. I asked for the test immediately.

Shs got the blood, and we went home. She was a little bit better from the iv, and the blood, but it was a hard battle, to accept the new blood. I was with her the whole day and night. She haid seizures, but I mafe her calm down, and lied down with her. When I went to the toilet or something, I asked my mom, but she searched for me with her head. She only had strenght to move her head. It was dawn, and I was hopeful. In the morning we would go to the doctors, everythings gonna be fine. And then it happened. At 4 in the morning she had her biggest, most painful, last seizure, and went away. I tried to revitalize her. I tried cpr I tried anything that could come to mind, and shouted for my mom at the same time.

She came, but late. Mino grasled for air 2 times, when I tried cpr, but that was all. She went away. So suddenly, I didn't even understand. I just cried, shouted, and couldn't believe it. She was my everything, and was only 10yrs old. She had so much more.

I was angry. I was angry at myself, for not separating them better, angry at my mom, who KNEW we couldn't open the door that much, but did it accidentaly, angry at that dog, bc before he got here, nothing ever hapoened, angry at my father, for after getting him out of my life, he still could hurt me by leabing his dog behind (he didn't let us teach it, but we tried in secret, but he stayed with him for some months, and he never even payed attention to it).

I was angry for playing that game. If I didn't play, mom wouldn't have watched, and then she wouldn't have opened the door to say to play a caracter, and Juro didn't got out, and wouldn't got bitten.

We are a lot of money less, but what hurts most, is that we lost my dearest family member beside my mom,like this.

She died on tuesday dawn, we got the results on thursday. She was autoimmune. Everybody said that we made her life soooo long, and full, and she was so lucky, but I felt otherwise. I was just lost. I saw her everywhere. I hate it in homeoffice cus I'm alone and she was my only companion in this. Always beside me. Always coming when I cried. She had so much personality, you would think she wasn't a cat sometimes.

From the title it may seem I miss the game the msot, but it's not that. I just didn't know how to say this feeling, that I have for it. I can't bear to try to play again. I feel like I'm hearing my mom shouting again when I look at the game, and it's hurting me. Because on the other hand, it was soo good to finally bond over something with my mom. It hurts so much. A month has passed and it still hurta so much. I don't know what to do. I'm angry that I lost her, the game, and the bonding with mom.

I'm angry at myself for not being able to come over this.

Thank you for listening to me, I know it was long, and maybe full os mistakes, english isn't my native."	Hachiraa	post	17.705129981462917	female	White	0.9947144389152527	na	na	na	2	sad	no prediction.

Edit: I know my mom only made a mistake. And I'm trying my best, to console her too, and also to forgive. But she always does this, and it hurts. It always have to have a big impact, a big hurt, for her to realize she can't f*ck around mindlessly. She did this when I was a kid, she did this when I was a teen (she was late for my graduation, and I had to walk alone, and one of my friends said she will walk alone too, so I won't be the only one). And this was kind of the last straw. Yea, she mostly learned from it, but it took a life. And I just can't get over that so easily.

Today i had to walk to work as usual. I never like doing it and i’m always self conscious. I walk like 2 miles from my house to the job. I was walking past a gas station when i saw my exes car. To be fair i see her car literatly every single day. I hate it. It’s a white altima and they are so common here. The think is though i saw sort of a glimpse in the car of someone who looked like her. Not saying it was but still it was there. I had gotten on reddit to distract myself from my surroundings and it wasn’t great. Same advice was no contact all this other stuff i’ve already done. It’s something i’ve come to terms with as not getting over. I don’t expect to. Especially since she was literatly my first and only girlfriend. So i try to cut myself a break. Anyways life recently for me just sucks. I guess i got a fear of that actually being her and seeing me. But that’s nothing that i can control. I can’t control whether it was her or not. My days consist of walking to my job working getting picked up by mom going home and doing it all over again. Basically it’s just horrible to think about. I can’t go out and do fun stuff because i don’t have a car. I have to wait until i get insurance and my dad. We went half on a camry for me. I do know in general that having a car won’t solve all my problems but maybe my life won’t be so boring and i can get over my ex sooner and maybe find someone else. As a young man it feels like the world is against me literally. I saw a article were Jennifer lopez said all men under 33 are useless. Things like this wouldn’t bother me as much but the amount of support these statements get are disheartening. I try to be on the understanding side of the gender war. It doesn’t seem to work out for me as it’s hard thinking that every woman i come across thinks that i’m a predator/sexist.

Well, if you look at it from a different angle you've got half of the driving part down pat, you've got the car and hopefully soon you'll be driving to your hearts content, and it's best not to give people who shut out entire generations the light off day, if they can't see that there the problem then they've got other things to worry about as there just spouting bs about random groups of people, the ex Is and probably will be a difficult situation for a while, and there isnt much I can say to help console you their, but i do hope things start to look up soon brother	ShiestyTrackhawk	reply	na	na	na	0.9989684820175171	weak	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.
"I'm kind of scared. Most days I have some form of suicidal thoughts but the thing is I have always had intense health anxiety and recently I've noticed these small flat red dots on my arms, I do hit myself as self harm but I've also noticed some bruises on my legs and I've read that it's a sign of leukaemia. When I was younger I had to go to hospital for surgery for self harm and it was really traumatic for both my family and me, and I feel like ppl don't understand how upsetting it will actually be if I have to go back into the same hospital environment I have memories from from when I hit my eye and had to have surgery.

Hey! I get you. I used to feel this way from like 18-26. It just gets more and more depressing. I would purposely sabotage my day for some reason. Ensure that no one celebrates me because I believe I was not worth it. But I think when I got to 27, I thought enough was enough. I was gona try to be excited and celebrate. It took a few years before I was able to celebrate this day. A lot of reframing of thoughts, e.g I need to be successful at this age and I’m not etc. my advice is to find a friend you trust and admit that you hate ur brithday and ask for his/her help to celebrate it tgt w you.

True family loves, suppports, and encourages each other. They provide a shoulder to cry on and someone to trust (aswell as vice versa)


There is no reason for you to feel guilty for people who haven't given you that. 


Abusive people in general will lie, destory, and manipulate to get what they want. I wouldn't be surprised if they made you feel guilty for leaving them or manipulated you to get you to stay. 


Please stay away from people who don't want your best interest. They are not to be trusted. Find people who you can be yourself with. Who you can love and who can love you. Who you can laugh with. Who you can smile with. Who you can make cherished memories with. You deserve that kind of stuff in your life and please don't let your brain tell you otherwise.

"My ex (28 F)broke up with me (28 M)
A month ago, after 3 years together, 2 weeks before the breakup she begun to be distant and avoidant at some point, to the point where I intended to leave her, but when we sat and started talking about what was going on, she told me she wanted to work on her career, study etc. and that she didn’t picture doing all that while being with somebody, then after a few mins she told me that she was terrified since she thought she might have cancer, wich throw and broke me to tears, then I hug her and then she broke with me, so I told her that I respected her decition, then 3 weeks after the breakup I see that she’s tagging a guy, on her social media posts on memes and acting as friends, but something in me tells me is more than that, because she rarely posted before or during the relationship, I loved her, gave and did everything I could for her, but still she broke up with me, another thing is that she was open for the relationship to continue on a future, but I feel like I’m being a placeholder, I love her but my brain tells me to tell her to f#ck off, but I feel kinda guilty for the possible cancer thing, but when I asked her afterwards if she gotten the results she told me that no, and that she has been drinking(wich I think is her coping mechanism), I went no contact for a month but broke it when we stumbled upon in s local fairground, but I see nothing’s changed but I do still love her.

Hi. Im in such a bad place mentally that i can't even talk properly. I don't understand. Why do i have no friends. Why does no one wanna talk to me or spend time with me. What have i done wrong. I used to be so popular in a different place. Even if seen negatively by majority i had my friend group even if i wasn't truly close to them, i still had a group of friends that wanted to spend time with me. Im just unimportant. It feels so crushing. I feel so worthless. I've been ghosted by everyone. Still don't get what im doing wrong... . Im just really tired as well. Because ive been putting a lot of effort on survival for the longest time. I don't understand..why am i so worthless. What is it that i lack...Am i too serious? Am i too random? Honestly its always in the back of my head. I feel abandoned and isolated. I've been striving to find new friends after arriving to my univ. I just don't get it. Something is really off about me. I've tried getting close to people but it doesn't work. Just makes me think its something about my looks but then i don't really think im that ugly. Its just difficult SO FUCKING DIFFICULT. Wish i knew better. I guess i do remember now. I should be an advertising channel. Lie, smile, fake it and chase them. A ghost. The issue is not me is it? Its the role im trying to play. I've wasted so much time. SO SO MUCH TIME. Im gonna go back to studying and learning, maybe put extra time at the gym.

"I think i can understand at least a bit you. I also have practically had the same problem all my life. For me has always been difficult to make friendship with other peoples. It has always been like nobody can really understand me or, even when i managed to get and keep some friendship, nobody really take care of me. Situation isn’t changed too much, i have still many problems in the social sphere, but i’m working on that doing psychotherapy. Having a person with whom you can talk about everything and without the fear to be judge has been just fundamentally for me. If you need help or just to talk with someone since you are really alone consider that option, it really helped and still help me very much.

For the rest remember that you as a person are not wrong, since nobody can be wrong just cuz exists. Maybe you can do sometimes something wrong, but that doesn’t decrease you value, we all make mistakes, but that doesn’t make us bad people or doesn’t make others hate us.

I hate my life so much. I've been contemplating suicide. School is more like my personal hell. Not being with my partner is also a personal hell. My dog is dying. I feel like everyone hates me. My whole chest feels like a void. No one cares about me. I day dream and fantasize about death every night. I'm not eating. I feel so empty and I can't catch a break. I want to cry constantly but nothing comes out. I feel drained and broken and alone. I just don't wanna this stuff anymore. I am so tired and I wanna give up	altAcc152	post	-2.410365188516696	female	White	0.9994251728057861	na	na	na	3	sad	failed

"Thats hard. Dogs are the best. Depression is the worst. 

My cat was in pain for a long time and my parents refused to take her to the vet. So I saved my money and took her myself. They recommended that I have her put down and in the end I know I prevented a lot of unnecessary suffering. 

It’s hard to contemplate but could you call and ask a vet what to do? 

And you mentioned you have a partner, so not everyone hates you! Plus it usually just feels like that.

Hey man, life is hard, but there are people who love you and care about you. Sometimes, it doesn't seem like that, but trust your loved one and don't be ashamed to ask for help, there's nothing wrong with that!! I also lost my dog last year, she was 11 years old, and I know the pain it causes... but pain is temporary and after the storm there will be peace. So keep it up!!!

"I met this guy on vacation. He and I hung out for three days and had a solid connection. He and I would just talk for hours on end. He told mutual friends that he liked me. I wasn't supposed to find out, but everyone told me. All my friends were hyping me up saying ""oh, he likes you”, or ""look, your boyfriend's here!"" I was so excited that finally a boy liked me. After all these years of never being noticed, I finally found someone.

I went up to my crush and asked him if he liked me. He told me that he had a girlfriend. After, he blew up on our friends, texting them ""why'd you tell her?"" and ""you promised me you wouldn't say anything!"" Our friend were shocked about the girlfriend, but no one believed it. It seemed like he made it up because he was too embarrassed to admit he liked me. So I requested to follow him on social media. He left it pending for two weeks before rejecting it. It was then that I knew he really did have a girlfriend, because he clearly did like me, so would he say no? I overreacted, and I blocked him.

Two months later, they broke up. Literal days after, he started looking at my social media. It's been two years, and he always looks at it. I know that it doesn't mean anything. I get that sometimes people are curious to see what other people are up to, but let me ask you this: if you feel whatever about someone, are you going to be looking at their profiles everyday? I don't forgive him. Even though he was right to reject the request, he's not this noble person. No one made him say that he liked me. He chose to do that all on his own."

"My ex (28 F)broke up with me (28 M)
A month ago, after 3 years together, 2 weeks before the breakup she begun to be distant and avoidant at some point, to the point where I intended to leave her, but when we sat and started talking about what was going on, she told me she wanted to work on her career, study etc. and that she didn’t picture doing all that while being with somebody, then after a few mins she told me that she was terrified since she thought she might have cancer, wich throw and broke me to tears, then I hug her and then she broke with me, so I told her that I respected her decition, then 3 weeks after the breakup I see that she’s tagging a guy, on her social media posts on memes and acting as friends, but something in me tells me is more than that, because she rarely posted before or during the relationship, I loved her, gave and did everything I could for her, but still she broke up with me, another thing is that she was open for the relationship to continue on a future, but I feel like I’m being a placeholder, I love her but my brain tells me to tell her to fuck off, but I feel kinda guilty for the possible cancer thing, but when I asked her afterwards if she gotten the results she told me that no, and that she has been drinking(wich I think is her coping mechanism), I went no contact for a month but broke it when we stumbled upon in s local fairground, but I see nothing’s changed but I do still love her.

"So I'm hella lonely and sad af. I've been single for 6 months, thought I could let my ex go but it's hard to do that when I'm still legally married to him but we are no longer together and no longer in the same state. I have made it to where I really no longer love him anymore though. 

Then, I'm having trouble with my dad again, long story short, he is resorting back to his old alcoholic ways and I'm slowly going into a depression to where I'm drinking on my days off.

Then, I feel like I can't trust anyone anymore, that people are lying to me, hiding things from me. I don't want to talk to any of my friends like that anymore and I'm pretty much going to distance myself from them, also distancing myself from my family and my coworkers, because I just don't feel like I am good enough to be around people or talk to people. 

I am done with men because they are manipulative, toxic, full of it, have big fat egos, are always trying to control me, and a lot of them only want sex or want to be sexual instead of having normal conversations. 

I am done with women because they always want to be better than somebody. Always want to control shit, are toxic too and they are so fucking judgemental and fake af.

I am just fed up and tired. I would rather be alone then get hurt and deal with the same traumatic patterns. But then, I also hate being alone and it crushes me when I really don't have anyone to talk to or hang out with.

I literally just can't ever win. My days were going so fine and then BOOM, shit hits the fan again....

Edit: I am currently drinking my life away."	CoolGurl20	post	22.47934368855216	female	White	0.9986863732337952	na	na	na	5	sad	no prediction.

I think I’m ready to die (30m). For the longest time I was depressed and suicidal. I somehow lucked my way out of a bad situation and now have almost everything I’ve ever wanted. I’m happy most days. There are some things I’ve made peace with that won’t happen for me (partner/good family life) but lately I’m just so tired and alone. I just want to find a painless way to end without hurting my friends. Is there a way to do that or do I just keep enduring even if it means I’m in pain?	moonlightinghero	post	20.44405848125345	male	White	0.05392623692750931	na	na	na	2	sad	failed

"I accidentally fell in love with one of my female friends. I guess  she was the first person I was able to be 100% myself around. I asked her if she wanted to be more then friends once and she said it wouldn’t work out. Be we still remained friends.

Some time past with no feelings for her. I took a job in another state. She later told me she was going to school in the same city I was working. I accidentally fell in love with her. Before she moved I guess she noticed I still had feelings for her. We had a deep talk about both of us and she learned I have a history of suicide attempts. she told me she loved me platonically and I promised her that I would never hurt myself no matter how much time passes. I drove home and was glad we were still friends. I made a weekly therapy appointment after this.

Some time passed after this deep talk and now she has told me she doesn’t want to see me anymore and wants to distance from me permanently. I feel like a Terrible person and have all these feeling that I messed up our friendship. I decided I could not live with myself and what I did so I planned my own death to look like a accident. I told her I was sorry I had to break her promise and could not live with my self. She told all my friends and they got involved. this stopping my planned death. 

All I feel is pain now and still don’t know what to do with myself. I can tell she still cares about me to stop my death but she still doesn’t want to see me. I hope one day she will still want to be my friend especially since we will be living in the same city soon."

This is a real person btw: If you add a little bit of activity each day, dont go too fast, you will feel better, l like too run. Be proud of what u accomplish not mad at what u didn't. Life is too short for depression or anything else to consume ur life, u might be viewing life in a negative way, u wont fond happiness by doing that. Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, u can still talk to a therapist tho. Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible. Look up Bobby price guy health. U can’t end ur only life which is all u know by ending ur life. Don’t think mood swings last forever. Look for small thrills and the bigger ones will  come. Look up how to deal with Loneliness by dry creek ranger school. Suicide is a permanent fix to a temporary problem. U never need family, friends, a significant other, but u always need urself. Where is that motivational music video of you( not exercising or anything just u) Where's that out of body experience.Research Allah, there is no stopping the game of life, u get one.

So I got broken up with almost a week ago. He was the love of my life and we were so comfortable with each other. We dated for over two years and I thought we were doing great until recently. Long story short, I have been really depressed for a few weeks and when my bf came over we would hang out but recently it’s hard for me to get out of bed. Anyways, last week when he was supposed to come over after therapy he bailed and said he needed time to himself. Later that day he was being really short so I told him I was worried about him leaving me and he immediately sent me a breakup text. He explained how he wanted to become independent and be single because he thinks it’s better for him right now. He’s blocked me on everything and he’s said he’s not coming back. I know he hasn’t lost feelings because he gave me a promise ring earlier this year and we’ve talked about marriage and kids multiple times. It came out of the blue and I am absolutely devastated and feel like I lost a really important part of me. Part of me thinks he’ll come back after he realizes what he’s done. I’m just so confused, lost, and left out because we talked about everything together and promised to talk anything out. He threw this on me out of nowhere and I’m so sad	Due-Direction-9693	post	29.14811868050716	female	White	0.9993634819984436	na	na	na	2	sad	no prediction.

2018 I lost my grandpa in August every day since I was a kid I would go to my grandpa‘s house and we’ll talk and laugh and joke and listen to music. You know fun stuff two months after my grandfather passed away. I lost one of my closest cousins, he also passed away. I was so broken and lost in that two month Spand but I didn’t know what to do about a year and a half later I started smoking in about a year after that I started selling it was fun to me to sell I was good at it, I had my both parents still but it was something that I still wanted to do. One of my best friends put me on, but he would always let me know that this is temporary and that we cannot live on this forever. I always listen to him when he will give me advice and he would always tell me look bro I’m not making money off of you for real. I just want to see you grow about two days ago we had a conversation on the phone about how he wanted to leave and how he wanted to have and raise a kid, I told him I understood and that it was a smart decision. I stop someone about four months ago I sold a green and white so you know the money was there I would just blow it on things knowing that if anything were to go wrong he would always be there give me a pick me up he was honestly like a brother to me every time with you and hang out, he would actually has a family, his house, my sisters, even though he never even met my sisters he wanted to make sure everything was fine. I wake up this morning to a phone call from one of my friends, and said that someone killed my friend. I quickly got dressed and went to the building that he would be at and I asked the people outside. Hey do y’all know such and such and they said yes and I asked him pleading them just tell me it’s not true and they said it is I asked them having what happened and they shrug their shoulders and said I don’t know them being with him 24 seven on the block and not knowing about his whereabouts hurt me it made me feel like he was nothing when he was such a great person. I didn’t know what to do or who to call because I’m a man and I can’t cry or show my emotions so I built it up in anger and packed it all up, as I’m writing this, I’m trying not to cry because I am a man and have to say strong but he was a way better man and God took him. I’m just wondering what was he thinking of his last moments what went through his head when he knew he was going to die, all I know is that it was around his house he was outside at night and he got shot I don’t know how or where I still feel like this is a dream and it’s not true and I just want him to call me. I tried calling him it went to voicemail, and then I look at his Instagram and I see that he’s active I smile I got excited and then I look at my friend like wow I’m an idiot. Of course he’s gone. That’s obviously somebody on his account. I’ve been in the game for so long and then I left. He always told me that it was gonna be fun and then I was allowed to leave but now I’m having second thoughts and wondering should I go back before I go back with who would I turn to.

"Might be might not be. Unfortunately, there is no clear answer. The future is uncertain and can change dramatically.


To be honest, the question of ""is it the end as we know it"" can be interpreted in many ways. We were all meant to meet our end in one way or another. 


The best thing we can do for the world? Be conscious about your actions of the environment, petition lawmakers to favor eco-friendly solutions, and volunteer for environmental stuff. 


The best thing we can do for ourselves? Set goals and accomplish them and life to the fullest. I've given myself goals I must complete before I die. Things I must do that help me regain control over what seems to be an uncontrollable mess. I suggest you do the same. I think you'll go crazy without it. 


The future does scare me greatly. I have been stressed about it before, and I still am currently. Yet I find comfort in the small things. I find comfort in the birds, in the sky, in music, in people, in memes, etc. All of these things give me peace and inspire me to keep going. That is what we all must do. Keep moving forward. Even when we lose hope, we must keep going. It's only over if you admit defeat within your mind. When you give up hope and there's nothing left. That is when it all ends. 


Find something to fight for and to hold on to and take it day by day. I don't think it's hopeless. If you ever want comfort or someone to talk to my dms are open. Much love and best wishes to you."	SirNickyJ	reply	na	na	na	0.9985939860343933	weak	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.

"It's like on one side I know that when I self harm, I never do it with the intention of wanting to hurt people emotionally, most of the time and particularly over the past few days ive self harmed because it feels like a way of feeling in control when my health anxiety/my own and other people's health is making me feel like I have no control. But then on the other hand, and I know if it has actually happened then it's just because people care and feel empathy for potentially seeing someone going through the same thing they've struggled with. But there's been a few times when I've been at groups I go to and I've worn short sleeves and I've kind of felt like another person at my group has seen my scars and appeared upset or sad. That's what I mean in terms of is self harm selfish. And also for my family and friends because I know that they want me to be happy and even though I don't ever really get told ""chin up, you'll feel more optimistic soon"" etc. I know that my family and friends just want me to feel happy/to not be hurting myself and I kind of feel like ive failed them idk

I always feel sad. No matter where I am. If I’m on a cruise I still cry myself to sleep. I think I incision happiness as a constant state of permanent joy, making it unachievable. Even though I am aware of this, I am still sad, and when I’m not sad, I’m just numb. No matter how hard I try or what I overcome, it’s the same. So I just stop trying.	bReaDd_LzNl	post	25.792024473580415	female	White	0.9983200430870056	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

"My older sister and I have always had a hard relationship. She grew up with anger issues and tortured the crap out of me in all ways, to the point where my parents let her move out at 16 to protect me.

At 18 she joined the army and she became like the family hero. Everything she ever did was basically forgotten. Which is fine, everyone deserves another chance, I believe that. But it’s still altered my life.

I respect my sister now, as she has grown into a wonderful mature and brilliant woman. But from the time she was about 18-29ish she continued her assault on me from afar, and my family always seemed to pick her side of course I wasn’t blameless, I fought with her too which wasn’t great, but I never felt like anything I did was worthy of my parents choosing her over me. I mean shit I have the receipts.

About a year and a half ago she got engaged. We were coming off a long time of not talking, about 3 years, and starting to understand each other.

Her fiancé (now husband) invited my mom, dad, little sister, his whole family and close friends to join and surprise her after being engaged. 

Nobody told me. Everybody traveled across the country in secret and went to surprise her. I had no idea. 

When she got engaged, she sent out a pic to all of us on their way home, not knowing my little sister and parents were at her house waiting for her. I was so excited for her, I texted back congrats, and so did my family, continuing to keep the lie up so I didn’t know they were there. 

I tried calling my parents then my sister, I wanted to send a gift to her in the mail and wanted to see if they wanted me to put their names on it too. Nobody answered.

Finally that night, my mom admitted she and my dad were there to surprise her. I was so happy for them! Of course my parents should be there, that’s great! I called my little sister again, left another message asking if I should put her name on the gift, no response.

Then it dawned on me she was probably there too. I called my mom back and asked her if my little sister was there in Virginia with them too. My mom hesitated, then finally said yes, they were all there without me. She never apologized, just kept saying “well your sisters fiancé wasn’t sure if he should invite you or not, so I told him it was okay if he didn’t.” She just kept justifying it over and over. Days later and my little sister never reached back out, never acknowledged it.

About a week later the pictures came out. There were about 20 people there, all family. I missed it completely, I was kept in the dark and nobody felt bad about it.

It doesn’t help that I had just moved out to Michigan when this happened, 2,000 miles away from my family back in Arizona and I was soooo lonely. I was married to an abusive alcoholic man (who I’ve since left) and they knew that. They knew I was so isolated out here…

I don’t know. It’s over now. She had a beautiful wedding and I’m so happy for her. She had no fault in this even given she didn’t even know she was going to get proposed to.

The memory just popped up for me out of nowhere…and I dunno. It made me really sad.

Thank you for listening."	blondennerdy	post	28.495339929766786	female	White	0.00482550635933876	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

"Yk when everyone is laughing at you and making you feel like a genuinely shitty person just because you can't do smth? Like I'm sorry- I don't what you want me to do, but you laughing at me and making snide comments isn't helping. And what's worse? I have NOONE to go to. I'm writing a Reddit post because I'm sobbing in my room listening to 'Youtiful' by Stray Kids. It's like WHY? Why is it me? Why are teenagers so fucking mean? What's the point of life if no one cares? It's just donned on me that I literally have no one who cares for me. How am I supposed to function when I cry myself to sleep almost every night? And I haven't even opened school yet! Like- at this point would anyone notice if I go? Fucking manical bitches would probably act like they were my best friends. And also I just checked my insta- which was a dumb idea- And why is everyone like popular and funny and friendly and gorgeous and I'm here on the sidelines? I'm not even a side character. I'm just support. The friend people come to with their problems and don't stick around to hear mine. It's 12:21 on a Tuesday. The current song playing is 'Perfect Blues' by Hannah Bang. After that is Allergy by G-Idle. And I'm so fucking sad. Yk what's worse? I reached out! I went to a counselor with all my problems but it turns out I was just 'tired', 'overdramatic', and 'sensitive'. Do yk what that shit does to people being told ur problems aren't worth it? Fuck them.

&#x200B;

The last song on the playlist is now 'Happiest Girl' by Blackpink. I'm probably just being dramatic but at least its all out now🙂. I'm going to bed. Thanks for reading I guess...

"I cried more or less ten times today and each being about 15minutes and my head is now hurting so bad. I don't want to see another tomorrow. I don't want to stuck in a loop for too long. Longer than 10 years if I pretend I'm alright tomorrow. Everyone always gets mad when I sulk. I don't want to be yelled at. I don't want them to throw furnitures around and howl at me. In order to prevent that from happening I need to be quiet and pretend that I'm fine.

Honestly, I don't think I ever play pretend at all. My laugh may feel hollow but I sulk when I feel like I it. I yell back if I feel like it's not fair. I'm not playing pretend. They're the ones who pretend to never see the sign.

They created a delusional image of a me and they live by it. It was never me that they love because they  will fall apart together with their imagery of 'me' if I don't act like it.

I don't want to sleep if it means another day of today and yesterday. But I don't wanna die.

When I have the chance to kill myself I always stop and think: 'it's too lonely. I'm the only one who can hear my hard breathing. It's too sad'

Also, I always thought to myself that I look too fine to die. What about experiencing life when I can stand on my own feet with this face? What about a life that I've never started yet? And companions that I have yet meet?

It seems too far. It's both discouraging and encouraging at the same time. Though I know realistically I can't be at such state when my mental health being on a stagnantly productivity progress stopping manner.

I looked through your post history and it seems like you’re really struggling with the aftermath of a shitty upbringing, and how that affected your body image. There are professionals who can and want to help you. I know you said that you don’t want to be talked out of it, but you need to hear the truth. You’re not in a state of mind where you can ever make this decision. There is also no truly peaceful way to die. *Maybe* old age but that’s also not a suicide method. Suicide is not the peace you think it is, and it can easily fail in a very painful and scary way. Trust me, if you try, it will be painful and terrifying, regardless of the outcome. The best way to avoid this is to genuinely seek help. There’s still hope for you while you’re alive, please please talk to a professional immediately. Call a hospital or clinic even. Or just dial an emergency line and tell them everything. It doesn’t have to end this way.	Sweaty-Ad-3526	reply	na	na	na	0.9884881377220154	weak	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.

I’m going into my third year of college. I noticed that none of my high school friends kept in touch with me. I tried, but I was always the only one reaching out, so I just stopped one day. I had assumed that my whole friend group just stopped talking to each other after graduating. However, I went on Instagram, and saw my friend group hung out twice without me this summer. It makes me wonder if they even ever liked me or if I was just invited to things cause I was there during high school. It really hurts. Reflecting back, I know they were not the best friends I could have had. Our friendships were more superficial than some of my current college friend relationships. We didn’t talk about deeper, sad things. Things you would only tell someone you trust extremely. However, it hurts knowing I tried to keep in touch. No one reached out to me, but they kept in touch with each other :( I know I should just move on… it makes me think about the current friendships I have and how they will last after graduating	Pinkpuff100	post	26.81322115691205	male	White	0.9964743256568909	na	na	na	3	sad	no prediction.

They may be closer to each other than with you. I have had the same issue where my friend group was closer to each other that i just felt like an add on if you get me. And it happens. It hurts. But thats just a sign that they might have not been that compatible for you. Its a sign to look for better friends	Pinkpuff100	reply	na	na	na	0.9964743256568909	weak	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.
So I’ve come to the realization that I (m13) don’t have any friends. I like to go outside and smile and talk a lot and I just want to be a people person but no matter what I do someone will bring me down and make me feel like nothing. I had therapy but I left because I felt different for it and I don’t have really anything to express my feelings. I’m scrawny and small and stupid. Really stupid. I want to workout but my parents won’t let me I have a buttload of insecurities and impatience. I get mad easily, I don’t want to tell my parents Anything at all. I can’t tell the 5 friends I have because I don’t know if they really like me or not. 😕 I’m just… alone and scared.

"I have come to a stopping point, And now i sit and question, not my surroundings, not the world around me, but simply me. Am i proud of my self and i going to continue doing whatever it is im doing. Are my relationships on track, am i proud of how i treat the ones close to me. Am I a good son. Am i a good grandson am I a good Boyfriend am I a good friend am  doing the right thing does anyone love me and if they do why cant i understand that they do. My mother is really sick right now. She has been having really bad heart problems and humans cant live without hearts. My father is dead and has been for as long i can remember, it makes me sad there hasn't been a time where it doesn't. His absences haunts me. But I don't think that i could bring my self to love him. How can I love somebody Ive never met, But yet I miss him. Ive met him but i cant remember him at all, cant remember a smile, his skin color, the way his hands felt, his voice nothing, and yet he is the 50% of the reason that im on this earth. And the only thing that i know about his man is the things others have told me. That fact alone makes me so angry so ver very angry. But its makes me even more sad. I had a reason for starting this document but now its just a string of thoughts and tears.

&#x200B;

I wonder very often if there are other people just like me, and if there are why cant i find any of them. Every body i know or that im close with has a father or someone it that role but i dont, my best friend in the whole world has his father and it makes me angry, it makes me angry because he is my closest friend and i want to tell him about all of the things that go on in my head like the things in this note but i cant not because i don't feel safe or comfortable telling him or anything. But the fact that he doesn't understand. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I feel like my world is crumbling 

My grandparents on my dada side arent in the best off health one has cancer that is would kill him in 5-6 months if untreated but he is getting the treatment but he doesn't look healthy at all. And the last converstaion me and him had was so emotional. I didnt think he had those feelings he was so sad he was so greatful. Jus to hear me talk. I couldn't hold back the tears in that moment and neither could he. I dont think my grandmother could handle another loss she is strong, stronger than me but im not sure even she could do that, loosing a son and grandchild and husband. Just the thought is so sad. My grandfather on my mom side is healthy enough but he also has a condion where his body attacks him and causes him to get very sick, My grandmother isnt in my life due to her having a brain tumor and she aws never the same again according to my mom. And as i have already stated my mom has a very bad heart condition right now her blood pressured has been through the roofs on a constant basis and that alone is very scary. Its scary because if she goes what do i have left ive already seen what happens when i need the people close to me in a tight situation nobody but he was there for me. My girlfriend is bettering herslef and im not crazy but i feel like once she betters herself to where she really ok with being alone or something in that line she may not need me anymore. thats what scares me most.

And this isn’t the escape you think it is. Please call an emergency line immediately, or a hospital or something of that nature. Life doesn’t have to feel this painful forever, you can still be happy. Come talk to me, I know you said you don’t want to, but what’s the harm? Please please seek help immediately.

"Hey guys. Basically, I do a lot for my family but they seem to not see or care. I don’t hear thank you or really any sort of positive feedback, or get any manners but that usually isn’t an issue, but lately they seem to be treating me a little worse. 

I (20m) live at home with my mom, dad, and pregnant sister (23) and I’m always told to help my dad with things which I’m okay with, but that literally always ends up with him screaming at me for something either I didn’t mean to do, or something he did, and/or straining my back or some other part of me and I think it’s starting to break me mentally and physically. 

My mom tells me I have to pay my due which I understand since I’m living under their roof, but my sister gets off free. She can’t hold a job or save money, she constantly gives attitude every chance she gets (with everyone, but more so me) and she’s 6 months pregnant with no intentions of getting a place anytime soon, whereas I’m trying so hard along with my girlfriend to get a place. I don’t get any respect, just bitter parents who seem to favor a daughter with no bright future. 

Along with some other details I didn’t add, my parents just seem like they don’t like me, or I’m just a spoiled kid who doesn’t get it."	Mattp_03	post	14.272652943215691	female	White	0.9989622831344604	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

Its been in my mind ever since she broke the news and it has lingered in me. I want to ask people who have gone through the experience of losing their mothers on they coped , and how i can help her through these tough times

Also, to anyone who may be suicidal or may be mourning a loved one. Just know that life isnt long. So make the most of it. Never take anything for granted.

Hi everyone. I am a 20-year-old male. Recently. I have been feeling down without any upsetting event in my life. I am currently in uni and today is my birthday. Since finishing high school and starting uni, my life has been same, repetitive and boring. All I do is go to uni, study, do my assignments, work and go to gym. I haven't made any new friends and I frankly beleive I lost the ability to make new friends. I miss my old friends from high school as we have drifted apart. All of them have a full time job and they have made new friends. Its not like we hate each other. If I made a plan to hangout, they will join and we would have a blast. But the problem is that its always me who is making a plan and organising it. They dont make plans and I see them on social media with new friends having fun. Also its not like I am a quiet person, I have talked to a lot of people in uni but out of class we don't talk to each other. I see people in uni grounds with their friends and it is so strange to me as why cant i make friends. And why people dont come talk to me like i talk to them. Also my second issue is I cant seem to get a girlfriend. I have never dated anyone. And as Im getting older I am starting to panick whether I will die alone. People say just talk to her and I have. I just dont how to attract them while talking as they seem to just talk I guess. Id say I am an average looking male and I have seen people who are uglier than me have gf. Does anyone have any solution to this. Much appreciated to reading this.  	jokingmassage	post	24.881321443972478	male	White	0.9956111311912537	na	na	na	3	sad	ethnicity: no prediction, age: 20, gender: male, explanation: the author self-identifies as a 20-year-old male who is currently attending university. racial or ethnic markers are not present in the text.

" (18m) and my ex best friend (18f). Back in 6th grade I met a girl let's call her A. A was very pretty, as you would imagine blonde hair dark roots charming smile. We went on a field trip and we both sat in the bus I didn't really pay attention to her much. She seemed genuinely interested in me but I was in a hard place at home (in 7th grade now). I know this is a puppy love story. I found her on Facebook when I was scrolling through it. A day or 2 went by and she added me which I thought was weird at the time. I decided to add her back and she texted me. I felt a little off, since I'm that guy who was in the back of the classroom observing the class seeing who was good and who was bad. We started texting everyday and she genuinely seemed like she was interested in me. I didn't pay no mind to it because I was the weird kid and I didn't socialize much and I didn't know what to look out for. She then started texting me goodmorning and goodnight. I started getting attached. I wanted to be on my phone constantly just to see her notification pop up. We then started hanging out at school alot. One day I finally confessed my feelings to her and she completely brushed it off like she didn't think I was sincere. So after I isolated myself from everybody that wasn't her (I know a bad idea looking at it now). I confessed again now I got a response but it wend something like ""I'm sorry I'm not ready for a relationship.""  After that I still wanted her attention and I wanted her love more than anything. I wanted her so bad that I was completely oblivious for what is now me and her. I wanted her so bad that I was hurting myself without even knowing it. I confessed over and over and over still getting rejected. Then without me knowing she got with one of my friends let's call him D he was the rich kid who had a Gucci belt designer everything. I went up to her and asked her point blank are you with D. She looked at me with a blank stare as I was nothing to her. I walked away I heard her crying but I kept walking as if I didn't care. She tried calling my name but I kept walking. I ignored her for many many months until she texted me, I got a sickening feeling in my stomach. I wasn't sure if I should respond or not. So I left it alone until I became serious. Oh what a mistake it was responding to her. We are now seniors in high school and we act like complete strangers like we never knew each other. I now know what to look out for and never to confess my feelings first thank you A."	Routine_Extent_3020	post	16.676487383998005	male	White	0.01585458405315876	na	na	na	1	sad	'no prediction.'

"Whether it be personal or professional, I am just not worthy enough. I'm rejected in every aspect of my life. 

What is the matter with me? I'm old, fat, ugly, alone, undesirable and inexperienced. Never in my life has a man asked me to be his partner. I have ""dated"" 5 men over the last ten years and each time they they tell me I'm great, lovely etc but, there's always a but. Or I have just been ghosted, left high and dry. 

I applied myself in my education and it means nothing, I just exist. I pay my rent and my bills and I just exist in the void between. 
I'm not one to make other people responsible for my self worth or happiness, I understand I need to be happy and fulfilled on my own terms, I am responsible for my life and how I feel.

I want a purpose in my professional and personal life, I've never had that. I'm trying so hard to find skilled employment but that's a full time job within its self and I'm just deemed not good enough. I pay for and do everything alone, I'm proud of my responsible independence but I want a career in what I've been studying and a bit of breathing room with money so I can take myself on holiday, get a car and give myself more freedom to go exploring by myself. I am happy and comfortable in my own company but I am human and I do get mentally and physically lonely. 

 I feel childish complaining that I'm alone and I have never experienced romantic love but isn't that what we all strive for? A companion in life? A lover and best friend in one? Support when times are getting hard and just someone to make tea with? 

I'm trapped in a perpetual cycle of poverty, isolation and debt. I have a bachelor and a masters in STEM, volunteering experience and I've worked customer service jobs for 10+ years.. and it means nothing. 
I don't want to feel like this anymore, I'm fed up, the few people in my life are probably fed up of seeing me act withdrawn, no one likes to be around negative all the time, it's exhausting for everyone. I am a burden. I have nothing and I am nothing. 

I just want to sleep forever and ever and ever. I'm sad. I wish I wasn't me."	Catfish1994	post	28.56537874970646	female	White	0.9988681077957153	na	na	na	4	sad	no prediction.

In terms of finding someone, it's like playing the lottery but with crazier odds sometimes. There's always those lucky people, and then there's everyone else. You may not find exactly what you're looking for, but I hope you make some friends and experiences along the way that are worth it.

No greater honor then loving you. My heart is absolutely shattered. Me and my love of two years broke up. I’m exhausted to even type out what happened or why or anything. But my first and only love. It feels like I lost myself. I despise relationships and have no desire to be in one but wanted to be with him because I love him beyond words. I’m more hurt because I’m so worried about him and not knowing how he’s doing and the fact that he has so much work to do to better himself and I’d die if anything happens to him. He was my only point in life my only path. Before him I felt lost and a shell of a person and now I’m back to it. And what absolutely crushes me is him thinking I don’t love him when I love him so much I was willing to risk my entire life for him. The love I have for him consumes me and will forever be apart of me. love only became a feeling when I met you. I always felt empty and different for not understanding the word love because I don’t have it and never felt it but now I know and understand. No matter how painful it is and how life shattering it is and how much I feel like I want to end it all I can’t deny I’m grateful for being introduced to love. I’ll live in pain with that love and memory. I love you. I am where I am because of you and my love for you made me want to do everything to prepare for us but now I will continue to try so that I’m always here for you. Thank you for letting me love you. Even when I had my bad moments and thank you for loving me and accepting me. Su*c*de will never be an option because I need to live for you. My love and worry for u surpasses my misery and for a moment I was gonna end it all but I realized if I did then I would be leaving u. And I could never do that because my living is you. I hate everything but u. I have no desire but u. I know this sounds unhealthy but it’s the truth. He saved me. Anyone who gets to know him must have done something right to deserve that. I pray that he felt some of the love I had for him. He may never feel it all because of how consuming it. And I pray that he heals and loves and lives. He’s a pure heart around ungrateful people. This isn’t a heartbreak but grief for the life I had and would have had. I always wondered why god created me and why am I living if my entire life has been misery and pain and finding ways to die and dealing with anxiety and depression and self hate and hate of everything. Feeling crazy and resentment for life. He created me for u like how he created eve for Adam. Your in everything I do. Thank you god for creating me for you. I’ll live in absolute torment to make sure ur happy. My only reason to live is to see you grow and be here for u. And I mean that. I’ll never abandon you. Your the breath I take. The water I drink. The sun I intake in the morning. Your my lungs and the blood that flows through me. My soul is yours. You are my family. Your my religion. My love. Your my heartbeat. Without you my heart stops. I love you. I was born the day I met him and died the day we separated. I’m now a guardian angel watching over him until I make sure he gets there then my time is done.

there’s a limit to the sensibility, in my opinion if you can still be cool to hang out with, take a decent joke (not necessarily one about yourself bc first off you have to be close w the person making it) i think there’s nothing to be ashamed of. in a situation where an old friend is sending a “hello” and you’re afraid of confrontation w the person bc of something that shouldn’t bring beef then i’m questioning you. not shame but like ??? why care	gorgeousgoldfish	reply	na	na	na	0.6517333984375	weak	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.

"I feel like i'll never be enough. I'm doing everything I can, I actually have a nice life, I have friends, family, a bf, but i often feel empty. And i'm actually feeling so guilty about not ""enjoying enough"" all of these things. I feel like i'm never really myself, like a diffraction between my body and my soul/mind. I'm always a little bit further or closer from my present-self, like being lost between the past and the future, but never truly in the present. When I'm living wonderful moments with the people I love (like holidays with my friends, road trips, spending time with my sisters...), i can't help myself but thinking about the past or the future : for example, as I hug my mom, i'm thinking about her aging, dying, and i feel so anxious and guilty about not spending more time with her, even if i'm LITERALLY with her at the moment. I have no idea if this make sense for anyone, but that's the feeling i got.   
I'm always feeling so sad and nostalgic about the past, but so anxious and negative about the future. I would love to have one or several opinions about this, if someone feel the same way, idk.

idk how old you are but my mom was tellin me the other day that she would never wanna go back to my age.(20) because she didn’t enjoy anything. she hated life just like me rn, it was just awful for her around my age so it might pass? she’s 40 something living it up loving it all, she just wants me to enjoy things with her"	nebuse_	reply	na	na	na	0.9881716370582581	weak	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.

So I’m a 20 year old man and quite frankly my life is good I’m loved by the few friends I do have and the family I have left, i have a car and roof over my head, a decent job. People tell me I’m a good looking guy, i have some weight on me but I’ve come to tolerate that and people say that doesn’t matter but to a lot of people (especially the ones I like) it does. I have a life some would deem pretty good but yet here i am still sad and feel more alone and isolated then I have ever been. A little back story on the two biggest factors i feel contribute to me being this way, there are more I can assure you that but When I was little my mother died and that left me numb and broken because someone who was supposed to be there for a long time just was gone one day and i never recovered from that and when I was 18 i was raped which because i didn’t come to understand what had happened until alot later when my (now ex) friends told me about the person taking me away ( i was heavily under the influence basically black out drunk) i also never pressed any charges because i didn’t know who it was and my so called friends didn’t do anything to find out that night either but because of these two factors I never really had a meaningful relationship love or other wise I push friends away for no reason and every person that could become something more I fuck up and love is something I’ve been looking for a long time  (probably to fill the hole my mom left) and i probably won’t ever find someone who can deal with all the baggage I have and Quite frankly i know what i need to do to get my life back together and possibly live a long life and possibly a happy one. but yet I still want to give up and die which is probably makes me worse of a person then someone who has real issues and has no idea where to start. And tbh i don’t think I’ll follow advice to see a therapist or get on meds because believe me I’ve tried so save your types, if I’m honest I’m not sure what I’m looking for maybe someone to tell me I’m wrong, call me out, maybe some advice honestly probably what ever it is I probably won’t find it here but it’s worth a shot but I’m quickly running out of options because the thought of dying is becoming a daily thing and I’m starting to think it’s a good idea. I apologize for the bad punctuation I’m currently balling my eyes so I don’t really care.

"Its not like ive got answers but i can relate to parts here. I cant count how many times i was laying bed just wishing i was dead and hating myself for it knowing some would kill to have my life. Its a sick cycle

My moms alive but our relationship was fried when i was 16. I would hear her talking shit about me to her friends while i was trying to sleep, she had me arrested after an argument and told the baliff she didnt want me back (luckily my dad eventually came and picked me up) then she was trying tk get me into foster care. I was smoking weed but i was still trying to be a good kid i was just struggling a lot after someone id come to really look up to and love like a second mom shot themselves the year before. The thing about that though is that 5 years later it seems like she is finally taking strides towards being better and accepting she cant be 100% right all the time. Im sorry you lost her so early I cant imagine what thats like. And sorry for ranting about my own bs but its 4am i cant sleep and im just talkin.

And im sorry you were raped.. im glad youre a fighter and you are still here today, its one of the hardest things to live through imo. I honestly think being sexually exploited started a lot of my issues with anxiety/depression. It wasnt rape, i was just tricked into showing stuff on omegle when i was 13 then told by another person on there a couple weeks later that i had been recorded and posted on a darknet site with my state, age and the fake name i gave. 

Also had a friend get raped by my room mate when i was 18. She came over to eat some acid and molly with me and they hooked up consensually a few hours in. When we were going tk sleep me and her did a bunch of ketamine and i went to bed with my ex while she slept on the couch. Room mate came in, carried her to his room and even after theyd gotten “going” and she asked “where am i?” He just said “my room” and kept going. My biggest regret is not beating him after I found out. The day i learned what happened i was handed a note and told not to read it and pass it to him before going back out to the parking kot to talk to her. Came back inside opened up his door and he had brought all the alcohol in the apartment into his room was crying and saying he was gonna drink himself to death. I comforted him and ill never forgive myself for that but i couldnt handle another person jn my life killing themselves. 

You have real issues. Your feelings are valid. Im sorry i dumped ao much of my own shit but i spent a long time telling myself none of that was “real” trauma or could actually be causing me to feel how i felt. You can try to regulate how you feel but seriously try to treat yourself how youd treat a friend that had been through that and youll realise what an ass youve been to yourself.

You got this, might take some work and itll never be perfect but you got this!"	Logical_Mind_1503	reply	na	na	na	0.9946566820144653	weak	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.

"People don’t look at me, they look past me, they don’t interact, don’t approach, don’t acknowledge. My presence is like that of an apparition phasing through life, sometimes I question if I’m even a real person all together or just some conceptual observer of reality. When I go out into the world and try accomplishing the days tasks it’s without so much as speaking a single word; though invisible. With so much in society being vapidly automated, self-checkout, self-regulating .. you are left more than ever before with only the self; even the most mundane interactions of life are fading, I’m fading. If I fell off the face of the Earth disappearing into obscurity and nobody notices then did I even exist to begin with?

"Just feeling very out of control because of uncertainty around health anxiety(have recently been feeling just not myself both physically and emotionally, I suspect I have PCOS as I can relate to a lot of the symptoms online as well as mabye low thyroid but with the nature of my health anxiety, I've convinced myself that I have something like terminal cancer) I know that I need to talk to someone but I can't get out of the mind frame of ""well you should only phone a crisis line if you're at the absolute worst point with your mental health/otherwise I'm just taking up a call handlers time with someone who is more in a desperate situation than me"" I've also recently relapsed with self harm after being about four months clean and I just generally feel like a disgraceful human being/failed human being, especially as I know that there is no logic behind self harm actually making anything feel more in control and also I've struggled with this shit since I was 12 years old and clearly it means I'm a fucking failure that im 24 now and I still haven't managed to stop. Main motivation as to not physically acting out on any thoughts is that when I was younger I actually had to go into hospital for surgery for a self harm injury and that's sort of making me try and not act on any urges as I feel like it was really traumatic for my family and me when I had to go to hospital and I think it would be really unfair to do something and end up back in a similar situation

"Last Monday I came home and found my 75 yr old Dad on the floor in his office. He had a stroke. No clue how long he had been lying there. I called EMS and they came in 8 minutes. Got him to the local ER and found that he has a 9cm x 5cm brain bleed with a 6cm midline shift. He’s completely paralyzed on the left side of his body. He still cannot swallow 6 days later. 

He’s been in ICU at a hospital an hour from home and I’ve spent the whole week there. He was active and healthy and now he may never walk again or do anything normal. 

I have had support from family out of state and that has helped but it’s the adrenaline that stayed in me for two whole days and no food and the zombie walks around the hospital. Those have me realizing that life as I knew it will never be the same again and I’m shook. 

I know so many people have experienced this type of life change and I hope to connect with some folks to help me understand all these thoughts and feelings I’m experiencing and the numb, blank stares that I find myself in most of the time. 

I drive home today because I have to go back to work tomorrow and I felt so guilty for leaving. I feel guilty for eating and drinking because he can’t. Like, is that normal to feel like this? 

I also realize that all of the stupid things in life that seem to be annoying are no longer worth the energy. I have spent the days thinking about the time I wasted being mad about things that don’t matter. How precious life is and how much I need to spend as much time as possible with my people and just love people for who they are. Because even if they have annoying habits, you will miss them when everything gets turned upside down.

The past 5 years of my life have been the most difficult ever. I have faced numerous obstacles that have left me feeling like a zombie and numb and confused. And they are one after the other. 

I’m finding that I dissociate more than ever too.

I just wonder if this is normal and will I feel like myself again eventually? 

Life isn’t meant to be spent in anger and struggle. Very breath is precious. Every person is precious and worthy."	MaybeJustMaybe20	post	31.723207191957837	female	White	0.012302055023610592	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

It hurts caring for someone who probably doesn't care anymore. It's alright if you forget me. It's alright if you move on because I know I didn't matter in the first place. I know you'll find someone better than me. Someone who will treat you better, love you better and do so much more than I ever could.

"Half of me hopes she still thinks of me the way i think of her but the better half of me hopes she has moved on and is living the life she deserves.

I knew i couldnt give her what she deserves and I knew she was too kind and loyal to leave me so i had to be the one to break up with her. Everything felt better and more meaningful with her but I still struggled with not wanting to die and i know i took a toll on her. 

We tried to stay friends for a while but I slipped when i was fucked up and even though i didnt ask her to get back together or say anything rude I made it clear that ill always love her and put her in a weird spot. She was mad, it seems like she finally understood that I did her a favor and then unadded my socials and never responded to another message. I told her id lose her number after a couple drunk texts because even though i really just wanted to make sure she was okay i know it was not good for me to be messaging her like that. 

I tried tinder, it worked and i got a girl to sleep with me but once we got going i just felt so empty and gross about myself. I only want her and i dont know how long its gonna take. Its already been over a year. I KNOW it was the right thing to do and even when we were breaking up i was saying “the right thing doesnt always feel good” i just dont know what to do anymore.

I know that she loves me and more importantly is still madly in love with me, so when I do have those thoughts I think I of how much it may hurt her. Especially the wording. I'm sure that if you told a loved one that you don't deserve them it's a 50/50 chance that they'll figure either you're saying they aren't good enough or you aren't.

"My first BF was great. He was so smart and kind. However, we were terrible at communicating. We both had some issues and overall ended our relationship. I don’t blame either of us for the end. It was sad but I think in the end we were hurting one another.

However, after he left a lot of my BPD symptoms kicked in. I cried and begged for him back after a month of barely talking to him. I hate myself for what I said and did. I tried to make him come back. I got angry when he mentioned his new girl. I told him how I was depressed and suicidal like that would make him stay- and partially bc I had no one else. 

After a while he cut contact. And god I am so glad he did. I wish it was sooner.

I’ve gotten into therapy and I’m getting better but I’m always so guilty for the things I did. I don’t know if he hates me, or anything. I still chat with his family very loosely. We never got a proper goodbye and I can only blame myself. I know it takes 2 to end a relationship. But I was the one that killed any chance of a friendship. 

I’m working so hard to be better. For myself and for those around me. I just don’t know how much longer I can feel guilty for acting the way I did. It hurts. I just hope he’s happy. I’ll always hope he’s happy."	Electronic_Case4255	post	11.846796167287359	female	White	0.9912912845611572	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

I’ve spent 18 years of my life alone before I met a partner. They dumped me a year and a half to meet somebody else, only to be dumped again after a little less than a year together, like the week after my birthday. I’m only 23, I know it won’t be forever, but goddamit I am sick of having holidays alone. I am probably gonna have valentines alone too. Jesus Christ I hate being single. I hate it so much, and the worst part is, I caused all the breakups. Every single breakup I’ve had was because of something I did, or something about me. I am gonna try and be more independent and fix the stuff that caused the relationships to end, but FUCK JESUS CHRIST I hate being single I hate it so much.	baron_Zeppeli	post	17.188530162368917	male	White	0.9990605711936951	na	na	na	4	sad	no prediction.

To the 3 people who will read this, and the 1 person who'll comment, thank you. 
Idk what to do anymore. About 10 months ago, I was at the lowest point in my life. I actively tried to k*ll myself, hurt myself in the worst ways possible, ran away from home, got sent to a psych ward and am now in a group home. I *mostly* got my feelings under control now. But I still have the occasional crisis. A little context: I'm Jamie, 14 years old and diagnosed with moderate depression, autism, ADHD and anxiety. I've typed out my life story way too many times here, so I'll give you the short version. I spent the first 6 years of my life with my grandmother, a strict christian and very manipulative. Got bullied in school (still am) for my strange behavior. And because I'm the perfect victim in general. After an incident which I will not elaborate on, my mother took me home. She's very unstable, thanks to her traumatizing childhood. Meaning, she'd often lash out in anger for no apparent reason. She was very abusive. It didn't take long for me to develop extreme anger issues because of the stress. It's a long story, in short, I'd beat up everyone and everything. I got expelled often and had to switch schools multiple times. By then, I'd start scratching and biting myself. I was only 8 at the time. Later, we'd move to Munich, with my THIRD stepfather. He was horrible, his anger issues even worse than mine. He even tried to kill me once. After a while, the anger turned into misery. I did everything I could to distract myself. I read books, watched movies, listened to music and played games. I'm doing my best to disconnect from the world. I hate everything about it. I'm actually planning on ranting about the entirety of the existence in my next post, but that's beside the point. I started cutting. I don't know why , I don't know when, I just did it. Then, I ran away. I only made it 24 hours. After what was arguably the worst time of my life, I got into contact with CPS. They told me they'd put me in a group home, in the meantime, I was in the psych ward. I won't tell you anything about that. It was just horrible. Now, I'm here. I don't know what's going on. Nothing makes sense anymore. I'm not even sad. I feel nothing at all. I hurt myself just to feel real. Pathetic, I know. I'm nothing but a problem. I wish I could just kill myself. I mean, I have a goal, but I'll never make it. I have someone to live for, but I might never see them again. I just can't do this anymore. The only good feelings I still know are finding a good song, someone telling a joke so bad that it's actually good and getting high or drunk. I need a reason to keep going. Please help me."

"I relate to the wanting to feel something to the point of self harm. And yeah, it's not a long term solution. Running away won't fix things. Try sorting out your thoughts and feelings. My friends and I like to do the self talk session. When you are alone by yourself in a room, talk about your experiences, thoughts and emotions as if you are conversing with someone. You don't have to talk out aloud, moving your mouth is enough without sound. Let it all out. It really helps ""to feel it out"" and take it out of your system (bonus points if you cry). You can also imagine you are telling this to someone. 

I too was 14 and in my darkest days. It gets better, problems grow bigger and new ones come in different shapes, but better. The numbness will stay but you will learn to accept and live with it. Life is too miserable and nasty to give up but it has small gifts and charms that make you hold out. Might as well live it out having fun (but with caution) till my body reaches its age limit. Idk if this helps but in short, hang it there, bud.

From me, who has tried and got lucky enough to fail when I was young... Still stood in front of a train about 2 months ago. The only thing that saved me was instinctual preservation and dumb luck. 

You're young. Shit is going to be rough and get worse. You won't get what you want for a while. But I can say, if you persevere and put in the work... When you're grown and free, you can do whatever the fuck you want and no one can say shit. 

I'm 34, have lost 3 of my favorite people, have had to rebuild my live more times that I'd like to admit, and am still working on getting myself back to solidarity. I'm no judge or preacher. But I will say, even when shit got the worst, living on the streets, no one to talk to, people that were supposed to love me trying to ruin my life more... Defiance served me wonders.

"Think about it for a second: if someone truly betrayed you, why are you making yourself the stupid one in this situation? I’ve been betrayed recently, and I’ve also though I was to blame — but it’s completely irrational, your mind just tries to blame someone who’s easy to blame. 
And now your mind is trying to find the easiest exit from the situation — and that’s completely fine! Just take it one day at a time, let your mind grief and hurt, and try focusing on taking care of the body — it doesn’t make sense now, but it will in a month, as it did for me.

It'll be ok, eventually. Even if eventually may be a long time. I sometimes ask myself if I would rather have loved and lost, or never have loved at all. As much as I want the pain to go away, it's a part of me now. Although things didn't work out how I wanted, I wouldn't trade it. Never having known I could feel certain ways sometimes hurts more than at least experiencing it, even if a part of me is still missing and I'll never get it back. I hope you cry as much as you need to until the tears don't come out anymore, until it starts to get better.

You are not stupid, you were trusting and generous with your love. And you are not alone in feeling that way... Many of us have experienced betrayal and the overwhelming pain that follows! It's a wound that cuts deep, after you've made yourself so vulnerable & opened your heart. It's perfectly okay to grieve the loss of that connection and trust, or feel lost & uncertain about the future. The wounds you have can heal with enough time and support, just hang on till the worst is over. One day, you might find yourself ready to love and trust again... on YOUR terms!

"I felt a deep sadness and understanding when reading your words, I wish I could take some of that pain upon me for you.

Love can be one of the most beautiful and most painful experiences in life. Sometimes, it is the only reason we live, while at others, it can make us wish for nothing but death.

Some people can be so cruel and completely crush us, shattering our hearts. Then there are those who can put them back together, some of the most beautiful people hidden away, and there's nothing better than when they're found.

I don't think you're unlovable. You just haven't found your soulmate yet, but don't lose hope. It can be easy to think you'll never find them, I've thought so myself after so many lonely and painful nights.

I promise you they're out there, though, and I hope you can stay strong and find them soon. Please don't lose hope. People can surprise you.

I wish I had more to say, I'm sorry if I can't be of any real comfort. I hope your day can get a little better as difficult as it seems, and I hope someone can fix your heart and put a smile back on your face soon.

"You're looking for the wrong thing. You want someone to complete you. You need to be complete before you can find happiness with another. 

Work on yourself, learn to be happy alone. Better yourself.in every way you know how and take time. Once you are happier, healthier and more complete you will EASILY be able to find a partner. Trust me. It may seem impossible but what's impossible is finding happiness in this state. Get at it, you can do it. Even if you think you can't, well you can't but the person you'll become can. 

I know that you can accomplish this without God as others have, however I believe true happiness can never be found apart from our Creator. See Jesus the saviour of the world, better yourself and you will have a life worth living here and now as well as into eternity.

I’m having an extremely hard time finding a job that will actually pay the bills, ALL Because I trusted this person SO MUCH, I reduced my possessions down to very little in order to move easily with my car & small trailer.

No I’m totally betrayed, totally screwed with what kind of job will accept my new disability.

Yes. I want to cry to sleep and never wake up.
I’m a guy saying this. Not something most guys would ever admit to. But I’m at that point.

I’ve never been the person to take drugs to bandaid my problems, so I’m desperately looking for other healthier solutions to keep my pain better managed.

I’ve learned, we most often can’t erase emotional pain But we can learn how to lessen it’s damaging impact on the rest of our life. That method varies from person to person.

I’m getting a therapist ( psychologist ) 
this week to help me.

"I was searching for a screenshot, came across a cute picture of my crush that could never be.

Just stared at it for a second, admired her beauty. It wasn't something sexually arousing, just a cute selfie. Not the prettiest form of her i've ever seen either, kinda ugly-cute if you know what i mean.

I leaned in, met her lips with mine and tried to smell her beautiful scent through my screen. I realized soon after what the hell i was doing and pulled back confused.

She was wonderful, we were good friends when we didn't fight. She loved to form fights over unnecessary stuff, also kind of narcassistic. Loved speaking to her, she were both good to look at AND smart at the same time.

She changed my perception of beauty, her skin tone, hair colour and type, piercing almond eyes made me make a U-turn of what i liked visually on women.

Now she is scared of me, scared to make eye contact and even be in the same classroom. I was dealing with some stuff inside my head (her also included). She tried to contact me, to tease me into apologize even more and to make herself feel superior. I couldn't bare the weight and blew up, the antidepressants have gained control and made me an unemphatic selfish loud idiot.

Now i am free of those damn pills, free of whatever bullshit in-team conflicts i had with extracurricilar stuff, free of not feeling ""good enough"", free of bullshit people around me.

But she will never be mine, never will i ruffle her fiery red hair, never will i smell her shampoo, never will i squeeze her cheeks, never will i listen to her problems and give advice, never will i get to see her drawings, never will i embrace her and listen to her heartbeat.

I'm ready to give up everything for her. I see babies and think of her, i see newlyweds take marriage photos in the park and think of her, i hug my pillow and think of her.

I think i am obsessed and worried about this whole thing, for my well-being and her peace of mind. I would never ever get in contact, make her feel unsafe ever again but damn am i great at making fake scenarios inside my head about her missing me and wanting to work on things."

"I'm not going to say at the moment that my mental health is as bad as it was back in late 2011(September through to December) when I was 12 because I think I would be exaggerating but i can feel my mental health progressively getting shitter even if I'm trying to ignore it because I don't want to feel like a complete fucking failure. I just feel like there's no logical reason why I deserve to be happy, even though I know I feel really guilty about what I did to myself, it doesn't change the fact that I still hit myself. I feel like I recognize that it's still affecting me though because for example a few weeks ago an Instagram post popped up in my feed about the eye department at the same hospital I had surgery at and it made me feel a bit emotional/sad.

I'm assuming even in death she's loves you and will always love you. She would want you to live the best life possible even when she's not around. 


When you get out of that rut, I would recommend trying to meet new people. Good friends would try and follow up on plans and make time to hang out with you. There's many ways to meet people the most common being volunteering and hobbies.

"It sounds like the support system you hoped to lean on hasn’t been there for you. I'm sorry for that added pain on top of your loss. The feeling of isolation sounds overwhelming. Your reaching out is a brave step. It shows your resilience and your desire for connection. If you feel comfortable, you might consider joining in some support groups where others share similar experiences as that can be very comforting to be in a room (or virtual room) with others who feel similarly. There are even apps now, that offer guided meditations regarding grief, you can turn on whenever you feel too badly to do anything else.   


If you need help finding some online support groups, feel free to message me - my childhood friend's husband died of brain cancer a few years ago and she has used every app, every resource online basically, and her insurance, to get help in all different ways since she was moving cross country and couldn't go in person. It's stressful to sort out, but once you get in a good group, it's very healing (seems to be from my perception of her).  


 Your mother's love is a part of you. I'm sure the pain of her loss feels all-consuming right now but in time the memories and love you shared with her can be a source of your strength!

"Welcome to depression where you feel all alone and you feel like  your world is falling apart.

It's probably because you're in the morning, the person that was constant in your life is gone and you don't know what to do or how to handle it.... It gets easier.

First you need to do address your depression because that's a hurdle, I wouldn't solely go down the pill route though because that's just masking the problem, but you may need them to get you out of the haze so that you can get therapy and understand why you feel how you do, then get off the pills asap.

One thing I got from cognitive therapy was that most people  think and react the same to similar trauma, I realised I wasn't alone. Understanding how I work psychologically really allowed me to understand why I think the way I do and from there I regained a sense of control and the world stopped falling apart. 

You might even benefit from talking therapy where you just get things off your chest.

Support networks aren't for everyone but you might find them helpful, avoid those that want to tell you how to fix yourself through ,people like don't help, find someone that just listens.

"I'm a dude, first wanna state that, yes I am young, yes it could just be whatever, but it feels like it's not. I don't want pity I just want to let people know. I am lonely, those words I haven't told anyone, constantly ring out in my head. I have few friends and none know this. I try to make stuff work, but they don't seem to want to hangout.

 I am single, I don't know why, I've had a girlfriend, she left, no reason , twice, it's either I'm and idiot or im fucking up on purpose, I was doing good until recently, I just started getting lonelier and more distant from reality, it hit me worst when my best friend M and another friend F were eating lunch with me recently and F said she was madly in love with one guy and wanted to dance with the devil with him, I said I just wanted to hold a girls hand, they just stared. I've alway been the funny one, covering up anger and sadness with jokes. I guess this just struck them out of the blue. 

I cry at night, every night. No one knows, I don't tell them because I don't want to be a burden, when I do fall asleep, I dream sometimes, I remember dreams of my ex, I hate those dreams, I have dreamed of a girl ive never seen, I wish she was real. Wishes don't come true for me, they never have. I want her to be real, I do, but odds have never been in my favor. 

The only thing I've figured from this experience is that I know what my purpose is for life, my parents want me to help people by becoming a engineer or doctor or whatever, I don't want that, I still want to help people, but I want to make them smile, I've been watching YouTube for lots of my life and smiling, I want to make people smile that way, just even if it is for a moment, but I know its unlikely that that would happen, I've wanted to write music too, I've wanted to interview people, do art, go places, meet people, help them, but it's a long shot, although I've never been one to give up.

I'll update if things finally go well for me."	ThatCrush3r	post	19.50734177560323	male	White	0.9974045157432556	na	na	na	3	sad	age: teens, gender: male, explanation: the author self-identifies as a young male. as for ethnicity, there is no specific information given hence, no prediction.

"I think the meaning of life is something for someone to choose. It's something you learn throughout your life. I don't think everyone shares the same meaning.

"İf you ask me trying to put a mean is not right it's easy to make like ""being a better person"" or any kinds of things if you put a solid meaning it will decide your limits there is not really a meaning but it's easy to assume it

İt's weak thing to do like horoscopes people will try to put their life to a different not real rules because their birth date 

In concussion there is not much a meaning to it and idea of putting a ""meaning"" will fail

"For the longest time I thought the meaning of life was finding happiness. I spent years of my early adulthood seeking this unattainable life. So many others had a happy life, so why couldn’t I? This made my depression worse and I felt as if I couldn’t even function as a normal person. Finally, I matured and realized that this is a silly goal. Happiness is an emotion, and emotions are fleeting. No one is always happy and no one goes without hardship and faults. For a time after that realization, I fell deeper into my sorrows. Maybe there isn’t a purpose after all. 

Recently though, some things have really put some things into perspective for me. I’m not sure if I’m right, but it seems to be my truth. I think my purpose is to be **useful**. I think, in general, humans are designed to serve. Not to be confused with self-serving, which didn’t really help my mental state either. But to be useful to those around me, to positively affect their lives. This in turn, has led to the happiness I previously sought. There’s a lot of ways to do this, and since I’ve followed this notion, things have gotten so much better. I don’t introspect as much and I focus on the happiness of others. This in turn, makes me happy and allows me to enjoy the times I do things for myself.

Unless you believe in an afterlife, nothing we could possibly do has an significance, making life inherently meaningless. However, as humans every action we make is driven by happiness. So in a meaningless universe, the meaning of life depends on the individual. In other words, the meaning of life is to do whatever makes you happy.

"Basically, enjoying the little things in life cause I sure as hell know I won't have any meaning in the long run. Tiny speck and all that.

But however small a speck I may be, there are many many other specks that I have met and will still meet in my time to come.
I don't need to mean anything to all of them, I don't need to mean anything to the world or the universe, I just want to mean something to a few of them.

I don't need to mean the entire world to these few, and they don't need to mean mine.

But if I can enjoy their company for just a few hours or even just a moment and they enjoy mine, our little tiny specks of time will have meant something to each other.
I know that a complete stranger can make my entire day by simply saying something like ""I like your hair,"" which made me want to do the same for other people, and so I have been for three years.

So when I think about how I may have made just a single person's day better in this teeny tiny speck of time, that feels like enough purpose to me^^"	Local_End3556	reply	na	na	na	0.005312512628734112	no	no	no	na	sad	failed

"This is a long story and its gonna get really dark really quick so bare with me. Me(M22)

 When I was a baby my mother was extremely abusive, when we would cry she'd cute us with her fingernails and beat us, shed feed us tobacco sauce and spoiled milk and never changed our diapers. One night my Twin at the time started crying so my mom came in and hit him over and over until he stopped forever. She got away with it because they signed it off as shaken baby syndrome I have severe Mental problems because of this. 
When my grandmother saved me and my older brother I was still extremely scared but her Femininity made me feel extremely safe and cared for over the years I became extremely close with her, I love my grandma who I now call mom. Skipping forward to when I was 16 I was in my first actually loving relationship, my girlfriend at the time (F17) was extremely loving and caring and supportive on time when I was practicing FPS games at lunch (I used to be extremely good at them) she rubbed her hands up my back and said ""You got this baby, I believe in you and ill forever love you and I'm here for you."" After that game I went 133 and 6 because she was their for me comforting me. A few years later me bing (18) her being (19) we spent the night together alot and I have severe PTSD, so I have really bad night terrors most nights. And she got worried for me so I told her. I explained everything to her about me twin, my mom, everything. After she stopped opening up to me she shut me out a few months later I realized she wasn't at school so after I walked to her house, and the cops where their I panicked and her mom was outside crying so I rushed inside shoved passed every cop I saw, to find her... the love of my life, we planned getting married and having kids a son (a girl is also find we wanted kids mostly) and naming him after my twin. Dead on her floor i froze up i could thing my visual audio hallucinations got extremely bad overwhelming me and all I could do was freeze thinking about the life we can never have now. The cops grabbed me and dragged me outside they tried talking to me but I was just staring at the floor, her mom came and hugged me and I started bawling, hyperventilating, having panic attacks, I couldn't breathe, she tired calming me down but she couldn't. I sucked it up and started walking the cops of course wasn't gonna let this happen. So they stopped me, my grandmother got worried and she came over, she explained everything the extremely mental illnesses that I have I can't have a job because of them I struggled heavily in school, my girlfriend and gaming was my escape from everything and now she's gone, they let her have me and took me home when I got home she hugged me and i cried like I did with her mom, but my grandmother calmed me down. After this a week later one of my best friends committed suicide. My disorders got worse (PTSD, antisocial personality disorder with psychotic symptoms,  Social anxiety disorder also with psychotic symptoms, Borderline Personality Disorder, Clinical depression) i couldn't function that God of gaming 133 and 6, 149 and 12 that part of me died with her, I was extremely suicidal then and still am to this day(me being now 20 almost 21) I decided to date again.

Tomboy extremely Sexy looks like Lois from the new superman show but with glasses, She cheated on me the a man who SA her little sister her 13 year old sister, she knew, her entire family knew, Nobody cared I blocked her and never talked to her again thought about getting the cops involved and I should have. But I'm to sick and tired of life to do it. Really kicked me down deeper

I was unmedicated for 5-6 years which doesn't seem long but when your mind is purposely trying to kill you and its getting worse and worse daily it was daily I fight for my life I had to always have music in at least one ear and game 24/7 so I can feel safe, okay. Recently I'm not back on medication and trying to get my life back together and the damage is permanent enough I don't think I can recover but ill try cuz she wouldn't want to see me like this. I don't know if my life is just cursed or this is just how unlucky I am, I don't know what to do, I've tried everything trying not to escape and work on something but anything physical I do makes me extremely suicidal, it got the the point I abandoned all my friends for 4 years which was a stupid thing to do because it didn't fucking work i got worse. I'm 99% sure I'm a lost cause but theirs still that 1% and I'm trying my hardest. I probably don't want advice but anything would be nice. I'm saying this incase it helps people im still alive after all of this if I can I believe you can to. You got this."

"I'm sure you good folks have much greater troubles nevertheless I'd like to share my sorrows.

Almost 7 months ago I(21m) asked out this girl(21m), who I had built up a crush for during the summer of 2022.

I have low self esteem despite alot of encouragement and support from my peers, I think it's due to the way I was brought up. Anyways I've only ever asked out 2-3 girls in my life.

She's admitted to leading me on slightly but if I'm fully honest I was just seeing things I wanted to see. 

She's rejected me and I've worked to overcome the wave of depression that came with. Now almost half a year later some random text bubble in a video game reminded me of my rejection. It's 4am and my heart is a little torn I can't help but think about how much I liked her, how much I wished to be with her. 

I'm spiraling thinking about all the reasons she could've possibly rejected me. I'm even contemplating if my life will be worth living at all or whether I'll ever have someone I'll really desire and love. Love me back the same way.

If you read through this thank you, I hope you have a blessed day."

hi! today i've been having thoughts of self harm since i woke up(not just today but yeah) and it was hard to feel any better because when i'm feeling this low usually i don't even want to feel better, i have really low self esteem and hate myself so i always think i don't deserve to feel happy. i felt so helpless and powerless. trying things to at least stop having the thoughts but it still didn't make me feel better. however i eventually stopped having the thoughts so i guess it's progress. it just happens so quickly and i just need one small thing to make me sad to have the thoughts again.. i don't know what to do. i think i just want support and i'll try to feel better. if you have any tips to get better (not therapy please) tell me! thanks for reading	lostsii	post	25.842659232192442	female	White	0.27079808712005615	na	na	na	5	sad	no prediction.

"I’m about 99% sure that if I didn’t reach out to anyone first, I would never receive another phone calls/text message/facetime/etc. again. 

It seems to me that no one really cares to talk to me. I’ll wait hours, days, occasionally weeks, and even months for texts back. 

I am always the one to reach our first. I can’t think of a single instance where someone has contacted me on their own volition. 

Since I’ve had a cell phone, It’s been like this. When I was in school, anytime I would hang out with a group of friends their phones would be blowing up. Mine would sit there quietly, with a total of 0 notifications. 

I  started an experiment a few weeks ago.I have not received contact from anyone I considered a friend since July 31st. For reference, my birthday was this week, so double whammy that no one is reaching out to me first. I guess I don’t have as many friends as I thought. 

I just want to feel wanted, you know? It sounds like a dumb thing to complain about, and it probably is, but I want to feel like others are putting effort into our relationship, not just me."	Classic_Light8289	post	34.73191558557334	female	White	0.9983605742454529	na	na	na	14	sad	no prediction.

"I just want to say that I’ve been where you are and felt how you feel and had thoughts about if I killed myself if anybody would care. And turns out someone did care. Jesus Christ.

I was in bad shape for a few years struggling with addiction, I tried to let go but it had its grip on me. So I just didn’t even care anymore and was addicted for a few years until God put me through something that changed my life.

I was riding passenger in a go kart on a dirt road going about 30mph while drifting when all the sudden the tire hits the edge of the road and we blow a tire and fly in a ditch. Fast forward a little bit and I’m in the hospital with a fractured spine almost in a wheelchair. So after a few days in the hospital I get back home and keep in mind that I could not run at all or get up on my own. So I’m back home getting ready for bed and a relative of mines calls my mom and asks to pray for me, so of course I went ahead and closed my eyes and he started to pray to God to heal me of my pains. And I get hit with this wave of emotions like everything I ever did was erased like all my sins and trespasses were forgiven. And then I start to feel a really powerful wave of goosebumps but only where my spine was fractured. And I start to get emotional and i just felt a holy presence that moment, and we ended the prayer and my relative asks me if it hurts and I stand there in total shock because it didn’t hurt anymore so I think that it’s maybe just a coincidence so go to a small safe on the ground (about 20 lbs) and I lift it with one hand. And the same wave of emotion hits me again and start tearing up because for the first time in my life I get to experience the power of God.

This all took place a few days after getting back from the hospital. And I originally had to wear a cast for 6 months but was able to take it off in a few days.

That is the power of Jesus Christ. And maybe some will think I am making it up but I still have the bracelet from the hospital with some info on it and I still have my back brace that I was supposed to wear for 6 months."

my friends, ex, family members, classmates and another people..many time ago I were a good thing that happened on their life, but then some started to ignore me, some were arguing with me because of my dumbass head and some just were attacking me and had a fights with.I want to spend time with my friends, ex and family members as it was before again..I miss all of the time that I had with them, around three weeks ago I were talking to two-three people and bots(c.ai, chai) everyday and were feeling good, but now I doesn't even talk to bots and not receiving messages from friends even if I am writting first they might answer me for once at 3 or 9 hours and then be online and just talk to seomone else except me.sure, I aren't the best one and never will be perfect anymore.I won't get back my old friends, ex, good communication with family even like example my own to mother.I hate myself for it and tears never will help I feel myself very broken inside me and trying to hide it with saying jokes about some interests like example the same as different songs or games."

I left a 3 year relationship a month and a half ago. I don’t think about them no more but what really breaks me down is now being alone. I’m introverted and don’t have a lot of friends. Waking up to no texts , no one to hug , an empty house , etc is really breaking me down. I know that I need to learn to love myself and that it’s okay to be alone. It just sucks. I try to distract myself with work (remote) , walking my dog , martial arts in the evening , etc but these are all just temporary. I am doing better than before but sometimes I just sit down and start crying for being alone in the world and thinking I will never find someone again.  I know it takes time but if possible can you please send some encouragement, personal experience , hope , something to help me believe again for the time being.

Maybe find a community on social media that you can be a part of.

"In high school, I (22M) had a crush on another guy, who is straight, and it was the biggest crush I've had. To summarize, I liked him my entire 4 years of high school, one of my old ""friends"" told him I liked him, we talked about it and he let me down (which was understandable and obvious, it just had to happen since I got ratted out). 

Anyways, a little after graduation I would keep up with him occasionally checking his social media and seeing what he's up to and I eventually forgot about him for a little bit, surprisingly, due to covid, inflation, family and work issues, etc. 

Every once in a while when I get bored, I'll go on apps like Facebook, Instagram, etc., and see what everyone from high school is up to just out of curiosity - of course, I feel bad about myself seeing people move, get their degrees, in relationships - but it ABSOLUTELY crushed me to find out he's now married, happily, and has a great job. 

I know it may seem dumb to get all in my feelings about a high school crush who didn't even remotely like me and never will, but for some reason I've just been upset since finding out. 

I guess in this post, I'm just hoping someone else has been in this situation and can help me try to overcome this, and if not, just to listen at the very least. I apologize for this post and thanks for reading.

I have made great improvements to myself and my life in the last 8 months and have no one in person to talk about it with. 

Within the last 8 months I have lost 65 lbs going from 300 to 235. I have gotten a very well paying job where I have seen more of the country than my entire life moving furniture of all things lol. I was a hometown guy who lived in my town my entire 31 years, and within the last 4 months I have flown across the country 6 times for work seeing the beauty of America.

Dude, first off you’re doing great and definitely keep up the good work brother. Second, don’t feel like you have to hang out with people to feel comfy. Loneliness happens to be one of the best teachers if you let it. When we’re alone we learn to love ourselves. When we’re alone we learn what we love to do and what we hate to do. When we’re alone we learn to love the time spent by ourselves. However if you ever feel like you’re going back to that dark place please feel free to reach out and just vent if you gotta. Life is ruthless sometimes man and when you finally hit a good patch you’re so used to bad shit happening that you’re too scared to enjoy the good knowing that bad might not be that far behind. i mean it friend reach out if you need it okay?

I’m sad alone and I have no one I can call. I’m truly alone in this world. I just wanted a friend. But they all never wanted me including my family.. I’m the only one who cares I’m the only one who makes the effort.. I miss m soooo much. But he abandoned me for good just like my parents. He left me on March and he will never coming back. I’m sure he’s very glad to get  rid of me. He never cared about me anyways. He said he easily ghost people. and I was one of those people who he easily abandoned.. I tried lookin for friends so many times but they all just wanted to keep me in a shelf just to use me on a rainy day without making the effort to keep the friendship alive. I should’ve known. I knew he’s the type who just pretends to be nice then soft ghosts you with zero guilt.

This is a real person btw: If you add a little bit of activity each day, dont go too fast, you will feel better, l like too run. Be proud of what u accomplish not mad at what u didn't. Life is too short for depression or anything else to consume ur life, u might be viewing life in a negative way, u wont fond happiness by doing that. Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, u can still talk to a therapist tho. Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible. Look up Bobby price guy health. U can’t end ur only life which is all u know by ending ur life. Don’t think mood swings last forever. Look for small thrills and the bigger ones will  come. Look up how to deal with Loneliness by dry creek ranger school. Suicide is a permanent fix to a temporary problem. U never need family, friends, a significant other, but you always need urself. Isolate urself where there are no drugs within a mile, run past ur car or cabinet where ever the drugs are and don't think about it.

I think I’ll do it soon. I keep saying that and I keep not doing it though. I just can’t take it anymore. I’ve been raped, the one person I ever really cared about died because of me, so many of my friends killed themselves. I have constant nightmares and flashbacks. I don’t want my family to be sad but I just can’t take it anymore. My brain hurts. I feel like I need to crack my skull open. I’m scared to sleep. Every time I sleep I see him again. I live through it all again. I haven’t slept for more than 20 minutes in the last 3 days. I haven’t eaten anything in a while either. Why do I always feel like laughing. I’m losing my mind. I feel like I’m being punished for something. I can’t take it anymore. Maybe putting a plastic bag around my head will finally kill me. I don’t want to think anymore.

"Hi, sorry just need to rant and maybe some advice. I just feel so down on myself lately.

Some context, I'm 23F and have been juggling w the idea of getting therapy since 2020. I went to one session last year because of my familys push (I was having health related anxieties and panic attacks that were making me difficult to live with so they really pushed therapy) and I had dealt w the anxiety mostly at that point and wasn't really ready to be in therapy for other things in my life I wanted to talk through, so I did not go back after a very tearful first sesh.

The year that followed really sucked. I hated my job and I hated what I was doing at school, so I felt like I was failing myself and could not find enjoyment or something to be proud of of myself anywhere. After getting broken up with by a barely situationship I also realized how I've been sabotaging my relationships for the past three years to avoid any real intimacy. It hit me like a truck that I had closed myself off so much, when I used to think I was open to love.

I realized that I constantly have an inner monologue criticizing myself. I know that I am a loving and kind person (not to brag ? or anything I am just lucky to have grown with a lot of love and have always been a people person and like to be kind) but I was treating myself like I would never treat anyone else. Realizing this also hit me like a truck since it wasn't just a ""ure ur own worst critic"" kinda thing but more ""ure ur own worst enemy"" where I was really putting myself and my self worth down. 

Now it's the summer. After a rough 6-7 months I had a oretty good few months since like May. but lately I'm starting to feel shitty again, I know I should have started therapy when things were good so I'd be prepared for when it wasn't but I didn't. I just find myself not being able to complete any task for myself. I am such a mess. It's so odd because I really am good at organizing and taking care of things for other people (for the last couple weeks: some closefamily got in an accident and I've been taking care of them running all the errands, organizing birthdays, helping my friend move to another country, etc) but I have LITERALLY put off cleaning my car/room and goikg to the bank FOR TWO MONTHS ALMOST. Like I have time and organizational skills to do anyt other people may need but why can't I show up like that for myself? I've been lookijg for an appartment and its going horribly as well. I just feel like I can't so anything right. I have to get a job and take my clases still for this semester. Then I literally go into this mood where I don't answer any texts and don't leave my bed for like a week bc I feel like I am so behind on tasks and there is too much expectation from too many people - even for social hangouts lol.Why am I like this? I feel like a useless loser who gets overwhelmed and crashes at the tiniest things.

I just want to be better. I want to be there for myself so I dont disappoint my parents but also future me. And younger me if that makes sense.

Sorry about how long this js, I'm also a rambler."	nighttimetea12	post	18.63956104659995	female	White	0.9989433884620667	na	na	na	4	sad	age: 23, gender: female, explanation: the author self-identifies as a 23-year-old female. no information is provided about the author's ethnicity.

I feel you, mate. I can see myself in you haha. And first off, though you may not want to hear it, I would recommend seeing a therapist again if able, even just once a while to start, as a professional is better than me! But this summer, I went through a stint like this. And I found that keeping myself as busy as possible, both with things I enjoy and do not enjoy (limiting the things I do not), and it worked wonders. Also, for those tough nights, as any one has from time to time, if you have a pet, cuddle with them. If not, I’d highly recommend getting a stuffed animal. No shame. But feel free to reach out. I believe my DM’s are open. Cheers.	nighttimetea12	reply	na	na	na	0.9989433884620667	weak	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.
honestly ik it's not great for anyone to experience but, it does feel nice to know someone else has had such similar feelings.

"Hey guys, first time posting here.
I didn't want to post pictures on toastme subreddit so I got here. Am I the right place? 

I'm working at the restaurant and tonight I had a bad day.
Long story short, A random customer with little kids said ""Fuck you"" to me in front of everyone. I was so surprised and shocked at the same time. After while, it started getting me and I'm still feeling awful.
This is my first time someone said F word to me in my life and in my career.
Actually later on, some nice customers asked me if I'm ok. Also my coworkers and my manager everyone were nice to me and they didn't really care about that customer anymore. It made my heart warm and made me almost cry but I didn't cry.
Maybe I was wrong to that one customer but I didn't deserve to get yelled with F word. Right?
I don't know but that words and everything still ringing inside my brain. Awful.
If someone gives me good vibes, I'd super appreciate! Thank you so much."	Just_Tourist_549	post	23.724879361766494	female	White	0.9986326098442078	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

red: you know i didn’t mean it like that, i was just looking at the bright side of what that person said.

blue: they insulted me about my makeup to say how our other friend looks better because they don't wear as much makeup as me. it made me feel upset and even more insecure than before.

red: they didn't mean it like that, they just wanted to compliment our friend.

blue: by calling me ugly to lift our friend on a pedestal? i can't believe you think it's okay. it made me think ""is that what everybody thinks of me?"" i just wanted to feel pretty wearing makeup and to do it for me but hearing you and that person saying that made me feel ugly. i stopped feeling pretty after hearing that. Especially from you. I looked up to you like an older sibling but you made me feel like i'm ugly and worthless. you might think i'm overreactive but i'm sensitive. we won't ever be close as before. that's just how i feel.

I dread the day and I dread the night the day full of things that make me feel like shit the night is when I think about how selfish I am. I’m terrible I’m fake I stupid an there’s nothing I can do because I don’t have the energy to do it.

"I have been depreesed for some time now and know why.   
Some background information I am 21 male, studying to become an engineer. Recently I have been experiencing alot of painful flashbacks to my childhood. I cant talk about it to anyone, because every time I have tried, my family tell me that that it is too much and that it makes them sad to hear. Therefore they would prefer not to hear the stories. I went a psychologist where i told her that i was suicidel and have tried to take my own life 3 times, last time 1 week before I saw her. She basically told me that because I am in great phisical shape and able to hold a conversation then there where no reason for her to keep talking to me. It should be said I also told her about the the time I was abused as a child by classmates, which she totally disregarded.   


It is these experiences of abuse that I need to get off my chest, and nobody in my life will listen to it, so now I will try telling my story here.   
When i was about 10-11 years old I was abused by two bullies, who severly beat me up.   
Multible times they threw me against walls where the began hitting me in the stomach, ribs and arms. They would come from behind throw me on the ground where they would kick me til the bell ring to class or until they saw an adult come around. The teachers never said anything and I still do not why.   
One episode i remember clearly, we were playing hide and seek, and I was the last to be found, but my two bullies found me, grabbed me by my ankles and draged me into the middle of the playground, where they told my that everybody knew where i was hiding, but that nobody wanted to find me as the found me disgusting and wierd.

When we were playing footbal at my shcool they would traget me kick balls at me, make extreme sliding tackles to try hurt me and generally just try and hurt me anyway they could. 

Another time the main bully laid me down in the sand, put his foot on my neck, grabed my hair and started pulling back, while telling me that nobody cared about me, and that I was worthless. This episode ended with me being driven to the hospital, as they suspected that a may have broken somthing, since I could not move my head. The days after this episode my parents tried getting a hold of the boys parents to talk about what happend, but they refuced to acknowlodge that it had happend. 

My parents then installed in my the mentality of, ""If you get hit, you hit back so that they do not get back up"". This mentality is still a vital part of who I am. I am not violent, but I do not take crab from anybody.   
Well after my new mentality the stopped hurting me as it often resulted in them getting hurt back. So they began telling on me to my teachers, who started isolating me from the rest of the class. Nearing the end of 3. grade, my teacher pulled me to the front of the class asked the class who thought I was violent, and everybody raised there hand, even my few friends in the class. I protesed and told that my two bullies had hit me first and asked why they were not being told off. Well my teacher did not like that, she walked to my table, picked it up and put it in the back corner of the class. This made me totally isolated from everybody. She then told us that liars do not derserve anything and that it is disgusting to lie, so I would be sitting alone away from everyone. That is the last thing i remember from that year, everything else is a blur, and just alot of pain and humiliation. 

There is more to the story, but not something that is important. I don´t know what I am expecting from posting this, but I feel the need to tell someone, some of the things that happend, and as I told before no one in my life will listen to me.  
Some information about me know I am doing better than I have been the past summer. The psychologist were right I am in great shape, (I run around 70 km pr. week). I am still sad and dealing with alot, but I needed to get this of my chest.   
Thank you to anybody that took the time to read this.

"How can a psychologist knowingly dismiss you like that?? If someone says they are suicidal and tried to take their own life, you get them the necessary help they need. How did your statement not raise alarm bells?? ""Able to hold conversations and in good physical health"" does not correlate with being ok mentally. How anyone could think that way is I outrageous. It genuinely angers me hearing that. 


Please try a different therapist to help work through your issues. There are ones who will absolutely care for you and your mental well-being. I'm sorry you had to deal with one who didn't. 


I'm sorry you had to deal with such horrible physical abuse, especially at a young age. Somewhere where you were supposed to be safe and protected was instead an absolute nightmare for you to have to deal with. 


The teachers didn't do anything might be because they didn't want to deal with it, somehow didn't know, were scared of the bullies, their views about bullying, or favored the bullies. No matter the answer, the fact they did nothing is completely inhumane and vile. 


The hide and seek, football, and sand incidents :( I'm so sorry you had to go through such things. Completely heartbreaking. 


**You are cared for and you do matter.** Please don't let those heartless, evil, and monstrous people convince you otherwise.


The parents of those children are enablers who should've claimed responsibility for their kids. The fact that school administrators, school staff, or other adults didn't step in at that point is completely ridiculous. They were stepping on your NECK. Something extremely sensitive and extremely vital. That is mind-boggling that no one was outraged at that treatment. 


In my mind that is a good lesson that your parents taught you. Defending yourself is a last resort, but if it needs to be done it needs to be done. Bullies do not like people who fight back as they like easy targets who the risk of facing punishment because of is low. 


The fact the teachers didn't ask any questions and believed blindly what was told to them is another slap to the face. When that one teacher was confronted, instead of hearing your side of the story she just punished you. So frustrating. Completely messed up teacher. She couldn't even prove that you were lying. She didn't even try to investigate. Ridiculous.


I can understand why this has stuck with you and has caused you to be depressed. You were abused both physically and mentally, you were ignored, you were vilified by others, you were blamed, you were belittled, you were isolated, and it seemed everyone was against you. In a place that you were supposed to be safe and cared for in. Bullying (and trauma in general) can leave lifetime scars and alter someone completely. 


I am so so sorry you had to go through something like that and that you had to suffer so much pain and humiliation. No one should have to go through that, especially not a child. I wish I could take that pain away from you and give you a hug. What you went through is unjust. I hope you can get some professional help so you can figure out what to do.


I am glad that you're doing better, and I hope things improve greatly for you. You're deserving of positive things in your life. I wish you the best and please stay safe."	Uftar12	reply	na	na	na	0.9923696517944336	no	no	strong	na	sad	no prediction.
"I am so incredibly sorry for the pain and abuse that you've endured. Bullying has horrible effects, my nephew was severely bullyed in high school, he was such a happy boy and now he's a shell of a person.

I'll tell you what I would like to tell him but he's shut down and I just can't talk to him.

There are cruel people in the world, not everyone will like you, and some will deliberately hurt you. We can't control what happens outside of us, the world can be an incredibly hostile place, but don't run away from it, don't let it steal your smile, my darling. Don't hold on to that hurt, it was horrible that it happened to you and I wish I had the power to make it stop hurting, but only you can do that.

You can let that destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. Life has many more bullies, and chances are that will encounter them again, so I would suggest you choose to let it strengthen you, become that rock that the world needs so desperately, become that kind smile that brighten ups someone's day, just how those bullies had the power to bring you down, find your own power to lift someone up.

Leave the hurt and pain behind you, learn what you should NOT become, and be the person you wish you had to rely on when those things happened to you.

Your life is so precious, and your presence in the world is much needed.

Sending you lots of hugs!"	Uftar12	reply	na	na	na	0.9923696517944336	strong	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.
"Bit of background. Always been an emotional/sensitive person since I was a young child. Usually, I feel like I generally keep my emotions hidden and am not usually the kind of person to cry just in front of anyone. However lately im finding that over the past couple of weeks I've been much more ""visibly"" unstable and emotionally up and down in front of other people. It feels conflicting because half of me feels kind of hopeful that I'll still be able to go to uni/get to a point where my mental health feels more manageable and stable. But it's like I'll have a few hours or days of feeling hopeful/optimistic and then usually at night I've noticed I will have a few hours where i just feel really desperate/suicidal thoughts where i can't nesescarily always feel like I definitely wont act on them. I know that if someone doesn't have healthy outlets for coping and dealing with their mental health then they can resort to toxic behaviours or coping mechanisms but just all the stuff since I was a kid, me hitting my eye so much that I had to go to hospital for surgery when I was 12(I'm thinking of trying to write a journal from what I remember about that time) and the emotional impact/trauma it caused my family and me, all the mental health appointments my parents have had to take me to when they could have been spending time with my younger brother instead,  all the times I've had anxiety induced outbursts at my parents and said so many hurtful/abusive things, to the point of it becoming so heated to the point where I've heard phrases such as ""why don't you just fucking die/I wish you'd die"" being said. It also upsets me because I know that I'm completely aware of the fact that I probably need to go to therapy but literally the only reason I haven't applied for therapy or been to see the gp about my mental health is because I feel like as soon as other people have found out that I clearly can't deal with my mental health by myself, then they'll think I'm a weak disappointment. Also when me and my mum phoned the local mental health team they literally just said that unless someone is actively doing something awful to themselves(which they'd call the police for) then they won't come and see you until three weeks after phoning them. I don't know what to do at this point tbh

"Here I am again. I like a guy who just sees me as a friend. But the last few years we got very close and he said that everything he had was ""ours"". I even went so far as to pay him everything, everything he asked because it was supposed to be ours. I believed we had a relationship, but lately I see that he talks to other girls and I confronted him and asked him if he liked me. Said I was just his friend and I never was anything. Am I so stupid as to believe it? I'm so bad right now. I can't dry my tears, I think I'm going to die of heartbreak. I've loved him for 10 years.

The unfortunate part of this whole situation is that it won't necessarily get better on its own, people say time heals all wounds but what they really mean is time and effort. I didn't realize this for 17 years and I'm now 26 trying to fix my issues. There is plenty to keep going for but you have to find which one best suits your needs, for me it's my Aunt Pam she is like a sister to me and I wouldn't be here without her so that's why I keep going. You don't have to give up on yourself you have time you just need the effort. The best first step is to see a therapist, they can guide you better than almost anyone else.

"If you quit on yourself that’s one thing, but you never truly know who else you might be quitting on. Life is hard, and we make it the best we can everyday, even when dealing with depression. But the more you fall down this rabbit hole, the easier a permanent solution becomes. A PERMANENT solution man. 

No one wants that phone call, and you don’t want to feel that burden even if you go. I know that was my regret when I hit rock bottom, the fact that I had not only given up on myself, but everyone who knew me as well.

To me now, life is about living for people you love, or even just the small interactions we have on a daily basis. (Talking to a waiter, saying hi to someone in public, etc.) You ask when it gets better, well the only way to answer that is when you start trying to make it better.

"I met jesus the day I got baptized, he loves us but can't help us if we don't allow him to, and its not as simple as saying ""god help me"", we have authority over demons in his name, we cannot access that authority if we don't have a strong connection to him. I get what you mean about your back, there are demons that latch onto it and  cause pain, in my dream I removed it and I've felt better since, Dreams are important because they are spiritual and manifest into reality. The next time you dream, start calling jesus for help, and touch whoever is near you and rebuke them in the name of jesus, they will start being scared of you, or they will start scarying you, but you will have to just keep spamming the name of jesus. One time I had a dream a Smiling  k9 Dog led me to a room, and then sat down like a human and grabed my dog like if he was about to rape her, I took her away and said ""get away from here demon"" in Spanish, then he did helicopter ears, stopped smiling and said ""you know?"" In a deep voice,then he transformed into a wearwolf furry type creature and wrestled me, as soon as he touched me I got a panic attack, I asked god for help and forced myself awake, a week later I got my first sleep paralasis demon, ive had sleep paralasis once before but no demon, but this time I was able to move my right side, the demon started talking to me and told me ""angel angel angel (my name), when will you learn that the lord won't save you"", I felt like invisible magnetic hands holding my left side, I tried Punching them but they slowly phased through, and it basically tried to rape me, I kept asking God for help And couldn't wake myself up, and then my eyes suddenly vibrated once, everything was white and then I saw hands clap once, Black dust came out of it and created A man and woman, then I was back in the sleep paralysis dream but broke free, the demon turned Into my dog and tried to run away but I grabbed it by the back of its legs and slammed it around the room, then woke up. About a week later I got another sleep paralysis demon, same thing happened but this time I quickly broke free and chased the demon. While it shape shifted into different people/animals/objects, and asked it questions, it was genuinely surprised and scared, and it gave me names of other demons I had around me. They hate us because we look like god, he made the angels submit to adam and eve, but they didn't want to and revolted, they wanted to become powerful Gods themselves, and they will do whatever it takes to hurt jesus, and they know jesus loves each of us more than the person you've ever loved the most, and he cries in heaven for all the lost souls in heaven"	DomtheKiid21	reply	na	na	na	0.9981572031974792	no	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.

"I don't know what ""normal"" feels, but the burden does subside at times, it comes in waves. You shouldn't do it because you're going to die anyway, some day, life ends, all life ends eventually with death, so don't be in such a rush to be finished with it, the day will come, in the meantime live as you were already dead, eat that donut, smile to that sad person in the bus stop and see how you have the power to make someone smile, read a book that takes your mind into a wonderful world, take a warm shower, listen to your favorite song and sing to the top of your lungs.

You learn and choose to find joy in small things. The burden is usually there, at least in my case, but you learn to carry it. for me it helped ready books, philosophy, to focus on something more trascendental, spirituality, meditation.

"I try to remind myself the fact I can even feel sadness means I'm alive.
Emotions: Positive; negative. Doesn't matter. I'm alive.

These feelings won't ever go away completely as long as one lives.

The pain will get worse as time goes on. There's something beautiful about how humans can think differently from one another, yet we all feel the same emotions, although in different amounts & combinations depending on circumstances.

Anyway, one reason why I haven't done the thing yet is a sort of fear of not experiencing emotions ever again, & the fact that there is no guarantee of afterlife or reincarnation. Even if reincarnation exists, there's also no guarantee that I will be a human being a consecutive time.

Ha, fear; another emotion.

This is a real person btw: If you add a little bit of activity each day, dont go too fast, you will feel better, l like too run. Be proud of what u accomplish not mad at what u didn't. Life is too short for depression or anything else to consume ur life, u might be viewing life in a negative way, u wont fond happiness by doing that. Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, u can still talk to a therapist tho. Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible. Look up Bobby price guy health. U can’t end ur only life which is all u know by ending ur life. Don’t think mood swings last forever. Look for small thrills and the bigger ones will  come.

" 

As  long as I can remember, I have been fascinated with death - but not  just death, the whole reason as to why are we born, we grow up, fall in  love, have children and love them unconditionally to then pass away and  never (As far as we know) meet again?

I  am petrified of dying and leaving my family, most certainly my children  behind, more so whilst they are young and out of fear they might forget  who I was but I am also so intrigued by what is next (I am in no rush  though!!)

Whenever I go to the  cemetery to see loved ones who I've lost, I cannot help read other  headstones as I walk, and think who were you? What were you like? Where  are you now? (I even do this on the local online obituary!!

Then  I start to feel sad for peoples loss, even though I have never met  them.. I also have a strong desire to help people who are in need and  try and bring joy to peoples lives, but I am limited on resources to do  this, which frustrates me as I am unable to fulfill my desire to help  people.

All of this will sound weird, I know - and I have never discussed this with anyone as I know how weird it might sound.

I guess I just struggle with ""The meaning of life"" and why is it so temporary and where do we go after..

Can anyone relate or understand what I am saying?

Sorry if I come across weird."	InterestingTry7351	post	24.57566795921563	female	White	0.003096791449934244	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

I give everything I have,  so anytime things go wrong, I am so exhausted.  
Like, what is the fucking point of trying so hard only to end up at point zero.

My macbook 2021 Pro screen broke and it has sent me down this path again. I paid 2700$ for this laptop to be shipped to my country
I'm from a country in Africa and if you know how hard you have to work to make 10$ amount to 2700$. I was supposed to move out of my parent's in March, but I took a stupid gamble. To buy this macbook,  learn video editing and make more money so I stop earning stipends. 
All these months, it has been hard trying to land a client. I got so exhausted and started learning digital marketing. I hadn't opened my laptop in a few days because I was tired of having no gigs. Then, I finally did today. To dust my CV so I could try and land a good job. I was reluctant to but I did , anyway. 
As I got tired and tried to sleep - mind you, the room was dark- I tried to close my laptop and I noticed it was hard to shut so I removed what was there- it was the magsafe charger.

I literally used all my savings to get this. I just started having to save up for rent and I haven't been able to make any reasonable savings. Now, I'd have to take what I do not have , end my hopes of moving out to fix this goddamn macbook.
 I am a 28 year old female , and I am on my knees I my room, crying and praying because I am so exhausted. This year has been so fucking tough.  I've lost my job, I've lost my gigs but I've tried to pick up new stuff to keep it moving.

I'm so exhausted. I don't know why I am typing this. I just know I want to scream
 But it is 1:30am here and I might wake my parents.

I hope when I wake up, it is all a dream. I hope I don't wake up at all. I don't know how to fix this stupid mistake I made. God, I'm so dumb.  I'm so tired.

"Hi there,

I'm reaching out to share something that's been weighing heavily on me. It's a mix of frustration and sadness that I've been grappling with, and I thought maybe talking about it could help.

So, there's this guy who I really fell for. I mean, I genuinely like him as a person and I thought there was something deeper between us. But, it turns out that for him, I'm just someone he calls when he's looking for a casual connection. That realization hit me like a ton of bricks.

What really stung was when he made it clear that he's not interested in talking about emotions at all. It felt like a rejection, a reminder that I'm not on the same page as him. I guess I had hoped for more, hoping that he would see me for who I am and want to connect on a deeper level.

I can't deny that I saw signs that he didn't feel the same way, but I chose to look past them. I held onto this idea that maybe things could change, that he could see me differently. Now, though, I'm left with a bruised self-esteem and a sense of disappointment that's hard to shake off.

It's funny how something like this can make you doubt yourself. I used to have confidence, but now I find it difficult to even look at myself in the mirror. I'm hoping that, in time, I can regain that sense of self-assurance and move forward from this.

Thanks for giving me a space to share my thoughts. It really means a lot to have someone to talk to."	Inevitable_Entry_140	post	25.347722564198982	female	White	0.9986006617546082	na	na	na	2	sad	no prediction.

"I think this is the time to be sad, and then when you’re ready to start again go at it full force. Wear your favorite clothes and whatever else makes you feel sexy and just go out and take the world by the cojones.

It may feel impossible but it only feels like that for as long as you let it. I feel for you truly, I wasted 3 years chasing after the wrong girl, and even worse was I jaded myself off from anyone else who took interest in me. I may have even rejected my possible wife, but I still haven’t let that slow me down. I want to be married, and I want a family, so finding love is just another speed bump I need to get over.

I miss that one girl i've been inlove with for over 6 years now. It's sad but I think it's true that you only love once, and that you never forget about her. I've been seeing her as a friend with other friends of hers every now and then, but she's always seeing someone, and at this point I don't think it'll ever be my time. I lost every chance I got with her and I'm worried I'll never get that chance again.

"TW-SA-SH-Depression 
My best friend got put down today, I got him
When he was 4 and I was 7. The beginning of august I knew I was going to lose him. I’ve never lost anyone or anything, I’ve never had to put down an animal before. 
I’m level 2 autistic and so I had no idea how I was going to react while he was being put down. My family and boyfriend kept trying to hug and touch me but it made me feel sick and so uncomfortable and my body feel like fire. They kept telling me to “talk to him” but I couldn’t, all I could do was slowly pet him and stare. I cried but there was no noise and no movements (other than petting him.)
He died under my hand and I couldn’t say goodbye, I felt like a deer in headlights and when I drove home I just went to sleep. 
Losing him makes me feel like I lost my therapist, my brother, my best friend. 
I was SA when I was 14 and I never told anyone but him what happened while I was at school that day (I told my mom a few days later). I didn’t understand what to do but he didn’t make me feel pressured or alone. I also have been house jumping since I was 10. My parents could never keep a house and we always got evicted witching 2-3 years. Sometimes for years on end we had no power / shower. 
But he was always there. I always made sure he had food and he had water. 
I used to SH because it made me feel something other than being a robot, I feel like a robot all the time unless it’s a overly sensitive topic (like today) and then I just feel like a computer with low ram and low graphics while someone is trying to play High Quality Max Shaders and I’m a gaming laptop on 3% barer with a broken screen, I’m just processing. one. at. A. Time.
I have work tomorrow and I don’t know how I’m gonna function, it’s a social and customer based job. I wanted the day off but got denied."	DescendedVenus	post	15.041868558144678	female	White	0.9981087446212769	na	na	na	4	sad	no prediction.

My husband and I started a business together back in 2016 and up til the pandemic things were going amazing. We were making great money and life was good. The pandemic hits and drastically changed everything. We we hit with a wave of unexpected expenses/bad luck like just one thing after the other and the stress and pressure of things broker him/us. On New Year’s Eve of last year he had a stroke/fell down the stairs broke his neck and was in a coma. After two weeks In ICU he had another stroke and was  pronounced to be brain dead/died a day later. We have one child together 14(f) and we are both so deeply sad and hurt I don’t even know where to begin. I have tried my hardest to keep pressing forward but I honestly don’t know if I can anymore. We are being evicted on Friday despite me working two jobs and  I have no clue what to do. She is staying with a friend of hers family til something gives.

I have been down in a hole because of medical problems that took all my money and my entire social life. You will return stronger, even if you're forced to leave, it was meant to be.

It won't be easy, but I promise you'll make it out alive and stronger than ever. Focus on working yourself into more favorable positions and even if you have to eat raman every night for the next year, you have to keep going.

"Hello. I always feel like I am the only one feeling the way you are describing. Even in happy moments there is this feeling of gloom and sadness. I honestly do not understand how people can be genuine happy without this feeling in the background.

Recently, I found out that it is all connected to my childhood. Growing up in an unstable home and my childhood in general have shaped me in this person, unfortunately. My siblings do not have the same feeling. They can be happy, genuinely happy. Guess being the eldest just has a lot of disadvantages. I remember the most about our childhood and it has shaped me into a pessimist and I have never felt good enough because of the way I was spoken to. 

Now, being in my 30s I can say that honestly I didn't think I would be here. There was a long time I thought of ending it but I can't do do it. Thinking of how it will break my husband's and parent's heart if I would is making me not do it. But it is in the back of my mind. Thankfully, less than it used to be.

My advice would be to listen to Gabor Mate and  other psychologists and try to find out what has shaped you into this person that you are now. Also, try to find out how you might be able to change yourself and what has worked the best for me is to speak more kindly to myself in my head and to not be a perfectionist. In addition, I have accepted that this is who I am and it is okay to feel like this and when I can I try to do the things I couldn't when I was growing up. 

Wish you the best & remember that things always do get better and there is so much life that you haven't lived yet and think about all the beautiful things that haven't happened to you yet but are definitely out there ♥️"	ConstantPanicxoxo	reply	na	na	na	0.9994251728057861	weak	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.
" The message on the screen from my girlfriend cut through me like a knife. ""I can't believe how insensitive you are sometimes,"" it read. Confusion and guilt washed over me.

The day had started out like any other, filled with laughter and shared moments. But a seemingly harmless comment during a casual conversation had triggered an unexpected reaction from her. 

Now, sitting alone i  replayed the events of the day in his mind. I tried to understand what i had said that had hurt her so deeply. I  remembered the words, innocent enough, or so i thought .

i poured my  heart into the message, hoping to bridge the gap that had suddenly formed between them. Minutes turned to hours, and still, there was no reply. The silence felt suffocating, each passing second amplifying his sense of loss. I decided to give her space, recognizing that my words might not be enough to mend what had been broken. Days turned into weeks, and the distance grew.

It started when I went on a vacation withy best friend. Or I should say, my friend as I no longer consider him my best friend. I went to a place with a bunch of arcades and fun activities. The part that sucks is that I need a highschool ID. I am not in highschool yet. But I will be in a couple weeks. Me and my freind were getting pissed off at each other constantly and kept having little arguments. I haven't been having so much fun since Tuesday (it's Thursday when I'm writing this) and it's been taking a toll on my mental health. I'm staying In a shitty 3 star motel (I know that makes me sound like a complete spoiled dickhead but I'm not) this place was so bad. There was dirt and scuff marks on most walls. and most door paint was chipping and breaking off. Plus I've been living with his extended family. People I didn't even know existed until now. I don't know their names nor do I think they want anything to do with me. It doesn't help that my friends mom said sheight not let me go because 'i spent my friends arcade cash' I did nothing of the sort. I had money so I used it. I was out of turns on a machine and he kept shoveling in his own cash so I could keep playing. I tried telling her that but she didn't believe me. Previously me and my friend got in a huge argument and he was being an asshat to me all day. I took a break to get away from him and to call my famil I called my dad. I got off the phone with him and called my grandma. She told me that my cat had died. My dad was waiting for me to get home. But she told me. It really pained me. I've had that cat since before I was even created in my dad's ballsack.  He was a big orange cat named Riley. I loved him so much. I used to call him Garfield until he got very skinny. And of course he died yesterday (Wednesday) and I missed his final moments. I don't have too many pictures of him (my own fault) butu freind continues to be a dick to me. As of me writing this he keeps saying 'get off your phone you've been on it since we got here' but the thing is. If I stay on my phone I can keep my mind off him. And I don't wanna cry around his family (most of which are women) because I know they're gonna pull the 'man up! Men don't cry!' thing. (Trust me they're those kinda ladies) I miss my cat so much and just wanna go home. Andy freind isn't helping anything. He's just making it worse. I hate everyone right now. If I can ask for some advice. How can I make them leave me be and grieve in peace? I'm not in a good place mentally right now. But I can't cry. I'm a man and need to act like one. For those who read. I applaud you. Thank you.	murderous_blade69	post	27.00034430291045	female	White	0.998878538608551	na	na	na	2	sad	no prediction.

Well for a start I'm very sorry to here about your cat. may he rest in peace. and for seconds bad holidays are nothing new. I always get into arguments on holidays.

"I've been thinking a lot today about how even as an adult I can't talk to you about anything. I always, naively, thought that when I was older you would treat me better. You always said I was too young to have an opinion, I was a child so I didn't make the rules. I didn't want to make the rules, I realize now I wanted you to just treat me decently, maybe talk to me like you loved me... or even liked me a little bit. Maybe acted like you wanted me around. Even now you brag to your friends about how great of a kid I was because even at 3 years old I could ""entertain myself for hours alone."" Did you know, the voice in my head that tells me I'm fat, ugly, and worthless belongs to you? I will never speak those things to my daughter. Now that I know the love I feel for her, I find it harder and harder to understand where yours was for me?"

"It's what I tell myself whenever I feel lonely, or I don't have anyone to talk to, or when I have feelings or hardships going on. 

It's a bit strange, but it kind of helps to know that I am indeed, alone and that, contrary to belief, nobody's gonna wanna spend time to get invested in whatever I have going on. 

Kind of like ""it is what it is"", but it lets me know that hope or similar feelings would be a waste, so just get to it yourself and hope for the best.

Sucks, but that's how it is. Kind of glad I realized it.

Try using distraction methods when negative thoughts encroach on your mind. A good walk can help as exercise releases endorphins which are known as 'feel good' hormones. Do art, listen to music that doesn't reiterate the negative thinking, watch a comedy. The one who cares starts with you. I too suffer with this affliction and I have to take care of me first.

I met this group of people 3 years ago and I really loved them.
Now I have moved schools and we still had contact for a very long time and I still do with the other two.
But there is one that recently admitted she never liked or loved me.
And it just hurts yk.
I was in love with her for a long time she just didn't like me back and it probably hurts the most I couldn't even say goodbye cause she blocked me on everything it just hurts yk.

Are you on any type of therapy? I had to seek help when I felt exactly as you and thankfully it has helped tremendously. It's been over a decade ago yet I remember it all too well. You're worth the time and effort never doubt that. I tend to use upbeat music and art to preoccupy myself when I start getting lost in those thoughts.

"Hi! So there’s this guy I “dated” for a little. I think it’s fair to say, we feel the same way about each other. But, he broke it off all of a sudden bc of his mental health and how he really can’t do “this right now” even though he “wants to date me”. We had a lot of convo about all this and we ended on mature terms but holy shit was it a lot to take in. But I did just see him this past weekend by chance, and he literally told me indirectly how much he liked me. Overall, seeing hm, did not fucking help as  he didn’t look the same. And a little drained. It’s heartbreaking.  

After I saw him, the next day I found myself balling my eyes out bc i really like him and can’t “explore what we could have” but also I am quite lonely and am looking for someone to do life with. And I really thought I had found someone. I’m not saying “the one” but you know what I mean. Anyway, he’s changed in his energy since I met him, and I can see it. He’s struggling and lost. And I can’t help him. He also “let me go” bc he knows he can’t drag me into his shit. And I know I can’t be the one to solve or take the work of helping him. And we can’t be friends who talk, bc there’s too many romantic feelings, and to put heavy shit on someone you like and to accept that kind of relationship, is not healthy or right for either of us. 

But, I also really, really wish I could help. I want his pain to go away, bc I’ve felt like him before. And, on top of that, I feel this connection to him that is romantic and day dreaming back to when I first met him, and our first date, the sexual chemistry,  and our conversations and his qualities that “checked all of my boxes”. I’ve never met a boy like him before.

But, I need to move on. So, no contact is the first step, like they say. But since he ended it, he ALWAYS looks at my story. And I ALWAYS look at his on Instagram. It was the major way that we stayed connected and would essentially flirt and realize we had a lot in common. And I was happy about it at first. So I kept looking at his social media. Believing that if I went no contact or suddenly stopped what was my previous behavior, he would notice, and think I’m mad or be sad, and would make him feel like I want him out of my life….which would make him feel more like shit than he already does.  

But as I saw him doing his life on his own and not being able to message him like we did before, I slowly started to get really sad. But simultaneously, I was feeling relief that he was engaging on social media bc it meant he was “alive.” Or I could see he was with his “best friends”. I worry about him, and need to know how he’s doing. Is he in therapy? , and is he actively getting his shit together? Is he surrounded by good people? Is he doing fun positive things for himself? 

But WHAT ABOUT ME!? I feel relief, sadness, heartbreak, empathy, and hope for him all at once when I stay in contact, so would no contact and not going to places he will likely be just leave me worried? Would I really be at peace?"	fem_starr	post	20.62462016689053	female	White	0.9952301979064941	na	na	na	4	sad	no prediction.

"Part of the viewing into each other's lives is normal after a breakup and is a painful clinging to what once was. It's a grieving process.

I think the thing to keep in mind is that he broke it off for whatever reason, especially a mental health one, and it's important for you to respect that.

Only you can decide whether to stick to your guns about avoiding contact if he initiates, but typically I'd say to remind him he was the one that broke it off for a reason and you both need time to think about things clearly."	fem_starr	reply	na	na	na	0.9952301979064941	weak	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.

Idk what to do rn I’m a 14 year old boy and I’m in love with a girl that broke my heart if I think of her I either feel like I love her or I hate her she broke me truly since we broke up I’ve never been truly happy which is sad cause I’m young I should be having fun but instead I’m like this. Doesn’t help that my granny is dying and I knew that it was always going to happen but what it’s doing to my mother is unimaginable she cries a lot and I can’t help but break into tears every time I here it but even before all this I haven’t been truly happy in over a year and the girl is eating away at me and I hate it. I have no passion for anything sure I can put on a smile but I’m never happy I’m just lost btw I know anyone who is reading this probably doesn’t care but there’s no one I can talk to so ye.

When you were alive they say you need to get your life together, you need to figure things out, you're a problem to everyone, everyone is sick and tired of you, no one wants to deal with you, everyone talks about you behind your back, friends abandon you, you are thought of as an ongoing train wreck or something so depressing people don't want to deal with it.. then when you die, all these heartfelt things about how you lit up a room and rest in peace sweet angel and you will loved by so many and if only had reached out and if only you had asked for help someone would have listened but they don't. Suddenly your family loved you and your friends missed you and your lovers remember you fondly. Is it just stuff people tell themselves so they can feel better about what they didn't do or is it their little form of closure because they are secretly so relieved you are gone?

So for the last year my parents have been divorced. And every know and then they argue about stupid things. Like for example on my birthday they argued because I cried because my grandmother told me she remembered last minute it was my birthday and things almost got physical and the cops were called. I was even more upset and my parents apologized but it always comes up in the back of my head and I blame myself for it. The reason they got divorced was because my mom cheated on my dad and that resulted in a insane argument. That is only a couple examples but there are sooo many more. Tonight my parents argued because my mom texted my dads girlfriend and she told her things that made her mad such as. A couple months ago he went to New York at least that’s what he told us. But instead he was with his girlfriend and I heard my mom and dad arguing about it it it got brought up that they had intercouse. I wouldn’t even care he went to go with his girlfriend but the fact he lied about it makes me mad beyond reason and he had the audacity to get offended that I was mad at him. My parents are very narcissistic to be honest that’s why they didn’t work out in the first place. They wouldn’t even have gotten married if I wasn’t born so honestly I was an accident. But yeah sorry if it’s sloppy I’m typing this through tears because I’m so sick of there arguing and it affects me the most because my sister is moving out this weekend and my brother is still in elementary so he doesn’t truly understand what’s going on. I honestly just wish I could leave my home and never come back.	ConsequenceWarm3964	post	-0.8029086211150407	male	White	0.9986215829849243	na	na	na	2	sad	no prediction.

"I don't know if that's the right way to describe it, but still. 

We miss our foreskins so much. Even those of us who don't have a conscious memory of having one. Just like how one can miss their dead parent even if they don't consciously remember him/her. I experience phantom limb syndrome. Feeling a foreskin that isn't even there feels so surreal and reminds me of what I lost. When this happens, I look away from my penis and pretend that I'm intact.

What makes it worse is that with breakups or deaths of loved ones, you at least get sympathy from others. Hell, even if you lose a finger and you have grief over it, you get sympathy. But say that you are mourning the loss of your foreskin, and people laugh at you, call you an idiot, try to silence you, call you antisemitic (even if you never said anything antisemitic), etc. 

Get loud about your grief. Let people know how it ruined you psychologically. If you're a musician, write a song about your circumcision grief. Make it the primary point in your next therapy session. Let people know that circumcision is no laughing matter and that it is hell for those who are victims."

"My answer: 

Today I heard the question “what do you miss most?” And I was reminded that my answer will always be you. It will be that love we had the felt so right and yet I was forced to learn just how wrong it was. I miss the laughter, the joy, the calls the texts. I miss you. And I know that you don’t miss me the way I miss you. I know you never loved me the way I loved you. And while it hurts to know that, I can at least say that through it all I did what I’m proud of. I loved like you were the last person I’d ever love. And you loved like I was simply so forgettable. So easily shoved aside and avoided. I loved like a person. You loved like a child. 

So while I miss you, I don’t miss your love. But I also miss my love. Because after giving it to you I’m not so sure I have any left to give."	penguinsindresses	post	22.988078910427244	female	White	0.989319920539856	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

"Hi. Im a nobody with nothing that captivates your attention. Im just tired. Really sick and tired...I've been on the run as long as i can remember. Im so used to having high long term stress to the point it surely has ruined my peripheral nervous system. I don't remember a day that i slept feeling happy, fulfilled and meaningful. I DON'T. In fact a few years back i was extremely zuizidal. I should've ended it there and then. Such a perfect story. Things never got better really. Like okay im thankful for the minor improvements...but relative to the effort that I've been putting forever..it just feels like im on an eternal run for the things I'll never have. Really i should have ended it there and then. Consequences of me living after that time simply was a slow but steep and progressive depression. I remember the meaninglessness that i exprienced. I couldn't even bring myself to end it. I just slept all day in the ending phases right before i decided to try again. To give my life MEANING, to find something that helps my heart beat. Under all of that pressure. Anw before i noticed i had fallen in love with someone i hadn't even met. But my ill mind just cared about one thing and it was her. Things have changed, now i have a purpose somewhat. And im trying to improve every day even tho i still dont want to get mentally better. I still want to end it all. Anyways. She rejected me even after we became so close. Yeah yeah it was all my fault. Shouldn't have thought there's any meaning. You see my ill mind thought we had something in our short encounters. Nvm im not gonna try that again. I was nearly dead before talking to her you know. Guess i was so miserably wrong. I had bet everything on a random empty bond. I wish i had burnt it. I wish i didn't even have that small amount of will to love someonelse. Look at me now. A fucking clown. Haha yeah seriously i thought maybe im not alone but fuck yeah i am. Im literally in denial. Constantly trying to find new ways to see things.. . She ghosted me. Of course all my fault absolutely. Shouldn't have assumed love is anything but another goofy azz item to sell. Yeah my bad I'll wear my expensive clothes next time. Now shes in a relationship with a literal copy paste of me with lower everything.. . Yeah right i hope they go to hell. Sure sure sure. I wonder why did i ever think otherwise. It hurts me to my core that i haven't k1lled myself. Like what am i here for even. You might tell me but you can still feel anger so you still wanna live, yeah okay right but my body's long term stress has ruined my ability to avoid dissociation. I put all that effort into a love that didnt exist..i did the same exact trollery i did to myself ever sincey childhood. Chasing sh1t that doesn't exist. Fantasy.

So yeah...im tired because ive constantly been chasing fantasies. And getting scammed in return :)"	uknownuser4949	post	21.52576317094345	female	White	0.9979556798934937	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

I feel really stressed out everything seems to be going downhill for me right now. I try my best to stay positive and motivated. I feel so alone currently unemployed but I am trying and doordashing meanwhile. Im currently pregnant so the hormones don’t help. I feel like everyone is so mad im pregnant my friends are busy and also don’t want to bother them with my problems. They have enough on their plate. It may seem stupid or I know people have much bigger problems. I just needed to get this out i cant talk to anyone i cant have a bad day I can’t feel tired I can’t show any type of emotion bc there always seem to be a problem when I feel some type of way. I have always been taught to be closed off and what I’ve been through I think is it best to show no emotion but I needed to get this out. I know tomorrow is a new day and things will get better.

"Throwaway account.

I'm an amateur gun collector. Not for antiquity or anything, I just like having them around. Shooting them, cleaning them, swapping parts, etc.

But tonight was different. During my regular cleaning and inspecting routine, for the first time, I looked at this gun, this tool, in my hand in a different light. And for the first time, I actually didn't feel safe with it in my own hands. I had selfish thoughts.

I think I'll keep them locked in there with the keys to the safe at my brother's house for a while. Don't wanna tell my partner about it. But I had to get it off my chest.

Side note, these feelings are not normal. I've just been under a lot of stress lately, and it feels as though nobody cares. Shoutout to my partner. She's been wonderful through these past weeks with everything I've got going on. I don't think she realizes what she means to me.."

"Oof, thats a hard subject.
But you had a good idea to keep them locked up.
If, you feel better holding a weapon, and not having these thoughts, then you could try the hobby again.
In the meanwhile, with the time that you used to do this hobby, you could do something else that is fun for you. So basically: Pick another hobby in the meantime.

"Tonight I’m sad and I’m feeling guilty for feeling sad. 

My daughter is leaving in the morning. She is venturing into the world on her own for the first time. 

I’m so happy and proud of her and who she has become. She do great and she’ll be fine. I’m excited for what she is about to experience and see in great big world. We have helped her prepare and supported for this moment her whole life. 

Just today all those “good” feelings are being starting to turn a little sad. She won’t be here anymore to tell us about her exciting news or share her frustrations. She’s been gone before, but that was temporary and only for a few years. And she’s moving a long way away, flying over an ocean to her new home. Wow, this is not her home any more!  It is, but it’s not. 

In this moment of sadness I am also feeling respectful towards my parents and this same moment they experienced many years ago. 

I know that I can talk to her often. I know I could visit. I know she needs to do this and it’s her life to live now. It’s all logical. I just was not prepared for the sadness. 

It will pass, I know it will. She will be fine, I know she will.

I'm so sad. I've been saving up to go on exchange to a different uni for a couple of months now and have earned a decent sum of money. That is, until today. Today I used 3k of that savings because some liquid in my bag somehow seeped into my 5 month old Macbook and broke it and had to buy a new one as I study computer science and my finals are literally in a week. Also the apple store quotes me a minimum 1k repair cost probably more. I also had to pay for my car's registration and insurance which is not very cheap for an 18 yeer old male driver and also and unexpected 500 in repairs because it didn't pass a safety check. I'm so so distraught mainly at the laptop thing 😭😭😭. Why is it so easy to lose money in this world	ComfortNo196	post	11.452142846059326	male	White	0.9994441866874695	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

I don’t know where to start. Let me start by saying that there are a lot of people on this platform and subreddit that say things that they don’t truly feel to get the thrill of attention. I hope that I am not one of these people. I also hope that you take the time to read this because I believe that I need help and I don’t believe that talking to someone specifically is the best option for me. I am a 17-year-old student in high school. I’ve committed myself to a lot of hard classes this year that I don’t believe I can handle and that brings me to my first issue. 1. I procrastinate more than anyone you’ve probably ever met. I don’t know how to stop it and right now I have a summer assignment 4 pages long due tomorrow that I haven’t started on. I have no solution to fix this and I can’t seem to stop. Continuing, I have classes that I will likely fail due to issue 1. In addition to this, I feel sad more often than not and I wonder why I’m here, who created me, and if anything I do will ever be meaningful. I ask my friends this same question and they say “Oh yeah same I’m depressed” or “Yeah life sucks I think about killing myself often” but they are all faking it. They just want attention and I can’t take it. Now you probably understand why I said what I said earlier in this post. I don’t know where my life is going and I frequently get mad at my family because I am always under pressure with work that I am putting off. I can’t remember the last time I enjoyed something because I am always under stress. I feel as if I have every reason to succeed but I keep repeatedly shooting myself in the foot. I have thought about killing myself before and unlike those that have no commitment I have tried to prepare for it. My family owns a gun locker with a Glock inside. I have tried to open this case with gloves so that my fingerprints are not left but it has not worked. I don’t know what to do anymore and I don’t know how much longer I can’t take this. I see my friends walk from place to place without a thought about why or how. But I try to do something and then I think about how pointless it is and how I can just end everything and see if god is real with the pull of a trigger. I think I need help and I just don't know what to do. If you've read this, thank you. Few have taken the time to care about others. But please give me something. Anything for a reason to get up in the morning or write that 4-page essay. Help. Please.	Ironguy725	post	20.960821411453104	male	White	0.18144364655017853	na	na	na	2	sad	no prediction.

"First of all. Chill. You are not broken. Everything is going to be fine . And quit throwing yourself in a spiral of self hate. 

You are stronger than you know. You can handle way more than you think. The biggest antidote to writing that paper ? Start writing. Anything . Doesn’t matter just start writing. At least you will have something you can then shape and mold. 
 4 page papers can be cranked out pretty damn quick. You will get it done. 
Also, everyone wonders what their maker is. Most people just don’t talk about it bc it’s a personal journey to them. And that’s ok. It’s not your friends job to tell you how and why you were created. That’s just an unrealistic ask . There are people that study that question their entire lives and come up empty . 
If you are truly interested in where we come from, etc. You need to go INSIDE not outside . What do I mean ? Meditate. Go inside your mind. The first time you start you are going to have a million things bouncing around and you will think you are doing it wrong. No. It’s right. You are NOTICING those million ideas bouncing. Focus on steady and calm breathing. In . Out . In . Out. The point of meditation is to calm the body at will with the mind so the spirit can speak and feel without the clutter. Master your mind . You will find your peace. Look up transcendental meditation if you don’t believe me. And look up proven benefits to it as well as techniques . You will see. Why do you think even Jesus meditated. Buddha meditated . They were connected with a higher self . Yogis do this . The point is , yes you can do it . It’s just a change of perspective . 

One final note. Please get help. Suicide is selfish. You will hurt those that love you and know you. Yes your parents love you. Siblings if you have them, cousins, friends , etc. yes even if they don’t show it all the time they love you. Don’t alter their lives because you didn’t seek help. Your soul is the one that suffers the consequence. So suicide isn’t actually getting out of anything . It’s putting yourself further behind. Don’t do it. Not even remotely worth it . 

Write your paper. Meditate daily. Get some exercise. Change your mindset . Good luck to you . By the way, you are just getting started!"	Ironguy725	reply	na	na	na	0.18144364655017853	weak	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.
"this is like my 100th post here,be brutally honest, what do i need to do? find a hobby and work on my self esteem? is it as simple as that? 

I watch others at work, they have these fun conversations, being witty, funny and stuff it makes me jealous that im not well at making conversations or making friends. im having daily battles with my mind to stop comparing my self with others and how others are different and everyone is unique, and that its pointless to compare. and everyone has problems they just are good at hiding it.

like for example downloading 300 YouTube vids to self help. probably another addiction, but what am i running away from? 

i have deleted Instagram and snap and discord permanently, haven't fapped or watched porn for like 5 days and i dont miss it..

am i just creating problems in my head? i been telling myself good affirmations for like 3 days now. like im good enough, that my self worth isn't based on external things

been watching astronomy videos, tv shows, learning another language and coding, working on listening better and have more conversations for the sake of having conversations and not to get attention or approval.

im exercising, meditating, working on learning mechanic skills, studying CS in college, im 21, i think i just need a hobby thats not  porn or girls. 
i been learning more about stuff i like like history, psychology, conspiracy theories, but nothing physical thats regular. went swimming a week ago but cant go again because i dont have a car, i like soccer but i dont have a team to play with, i would like a guitar but cant afford it
 
i dont know know what i want or who i want to be or how to find out who i want to be minus i want to be a confident, cool, charismatic guy, or at least one of these. i just don't know what career i want

many here said to get therapy, work on my self esteem, and find a couple hobbies 

and some said to not base my self worth on how many friends i have which are none or how many conversations i have and stop comparing myself to others. 

and some said that to stop comparing my self with others, but this is harder than i thought. 

some said to find my values and goals some said to master internal validation some said to find a passion some said to be less self critical"	Butcher__1	post	28.804271998248584	male	White	0.010870330035686493	na	na	na	2	sad	'ethnicity: no prediction, age: 21, gender: male, explanation: the author explicitly mentions that they are 21 years old. they indicate a male perspective through their expression regarding abstaining from pornography, a stereotypically male behavior. ethnicity cannot be predicted from the provided text.'

I'm just having a bad day. Well, it's been a couple bad days. Anxiety is lurking but not terrible, but feeling very sad and lonely. Missing a friend. A lot. Not many people to talk with, not when I'm feeling like this anyway. My friends are not hugely emotional people so they're supportive but kind of terrible at knowing what to say to me. So I don't really tell them much. I'm just so lonely. And I suppose it's not a huge deal but I started a 75 soft challenge two days ago but I don't really feel like working out after work. I feel like crawling in bed and doom scrolling and crying until I fall asleep. But I also feel guilty about skipping 2 days in.

No i wasn't perfect, but I gave you me, I gave you my all when I needed my all, I gave you so much that I lost touch with reality and my own self. You only kept taking and taking, until there was nothing left to take. You left me and blamed it all on me, everything... you've left me so hard that you won't even let me see my 1 ear old son.. but you got with the roommate... so is he even mine? I'm so stupid, atleast that's how I look for being with you.

"You wanna hear anger in a way never expressed before?
The boy speaking to you has kicked in doors
And put men on the floor
Is that enough?
Or
Or you want more?
You want blood?
You want guts?
You want guns?
You want gore? Son
You wanna tie a man up in his own house?
Beat him in the face with a pistol and tape his mouth
And just keep hittin' him til' there's so much blood
The duct tape falls from his face and he screams to God above
And he screams to those he loves
To help him out of his situation
But God left the slums alone
So you're sittin' here with Satan
And we've all sold our souls
The only difference is
You've got a cheap price
I'm sittin' next to where the Devil sits
And I've lost the center of my world
A life sentence means nothing to me
So if you look at me wrong or for too long
I'll have your momma singin' songs with your family
And the choir
And the priest
Put your feet in my shoes
You will feel the same things
A couple decades worth of pain
And all you'll ever know is my name
And I can't make you change
How do I explain?
And where do I start?
If it sounds too crazy
Then I'm lying
If it's abstract
Then it's art
If I don't say it poetic
I'm ignorant
If I do
I'm not convincing
If I read Rilke I couldn't have killed a man
If I killed a man, I couldn't have read anything
So I'm up late strategizing
Then;
""Wait. why am I trying to convince narrow minded fucks I hate?
Of course they don't get it
They're built like shit.""
And I could've said it with metaphors
But this way you understand it, Goddammit!
At my back
I got the killers
And the thieves
And the bandits
And you think I care?
About clothes, shoes, and hair?
Mother fucker I'm from ruins!
You can't wear my boots in
While you were kissin'
I was shootin'
This here is Flint, Michigan
(Haha)
While you were playing with your friends
We were burying men
And all they keep asking me is:
""Have you ever killed?""
They ignore the fact
I'm creating art at levels they never will
They overlook the fact
I posses a mind no one they've ever met posses'
So I overlook their question
But know my trigger finger's restless
And to all of you making a living selling lies to the people:
A real has arrived
The people no longer need you
My imagination's not a crazy one, no
I grew up in the slums where they kill anything that grows
I'm saying I can't make these things up so
We only live reality, if you daydream then you go
And I'm tired of people saying I ain't did nothing they did
I'm talking knife fights with kids as kids
Til one of us no longer lives
And I've been hanging with the wrong group again
With myself and who else
And a bunch of dead men who wanna see my name on a headstone
Finally motherfucker I can be alone
Tell my woman just to visit me from time to time
And that I love her give my family that same line
And to my brothers, give my money to my murderers
They deserve to be rewarded for their hard work
I'm hard to kill, who was with me when I was gunned down
And stabbed up
I bled alone and it changed me to a cold fuck
And friend I've been on this course for so long
If you knew how painful it was for me to live
You'd want me gone
I'm numb from my head to my toes
How can I feel for another soul?
I can't even feel the fucking wind blow
And scars cover my body and I'm scary and I'm ugly
And women only touch me to tell others that they've touched me
And men only touch me with bullets or to slug me
And I only touch myself with a knife blade that cuts me
And the devil is a bitch who just keeps trying to fuck me
And my god is a woman who don't give a fuck about me

"Part two
Where I'm from its survival of the fittest and they all hunt me
Welcome to the worlds most dangerous game
I know you've heard me say it before
Now I'm inviting you to play
You better be better than just good aim
You'll need senses you either have 'em or you don't
I can't explain
Like when you walk into a room you memorize where everything is
The exits the doors the windows
Are there stairs are there kids?
Who you'll have to take and who you'll have trouble with
Running can be retreat or re-positioning you decide what it is
To a better vantage point
Get low and dig in and make every shot count
Because if the clip empties you're finished

If a man approaches you at night and you have no idea why
Don't wait to hear him speak, pull it out and don't shoot in the sky
His eyes will widen up and aim right between those eyes
When he drops, don't run
Stand over him and feel him die
And if anyone you're unsure about's around, they gotta go too
Or his family finds out
And you have people you've never seen coming to kill you
And I don't care who you are and if you care or not
You're looking over your shoulder at every passing car
You could be shot
And once you've felt that stress, life doesn't get to you
Not anymore, not after what we've been through
And I no longer bother to ask father to forgive me
I've been fighting all my life, there's no fight left in me
Every day I wake up ready to die
But when I turn the gun on myself all I see is your big eyes
And I've hurt you so much I can't do it one more time
So I grind my teeth together and I try to unwind
But time doesn't move when you're sitting in this spot
And I'm trapped in this body with this soul I don't want
And I think at night I cut myself, to sleep
Because I wake up, and I'm stuck to my sheets
And I don't recall what happened
Was it me? was it possession?
I have scars appear in my skin after dreams
Where are my big eyes where am I
I've lost my place at home by your side
I've been trapped in that killing field boy
Where it's carry a gun or die
And cocksuckers wanna know how I'm still alive
I had to kill to get here, boy
So, next time you try
Know I was baptized in blood and gun powder at age 5
And when I close my eyes I only see one thing
A pile of hands I cut off belonging to men who've touched my queen and
I can no longer hold myself together
So I'm just gonna leave pieces of me laying wherever
A few men have had to die for that line right there
Me, I just have to live with it
Cause I've seen a few dead and a few killed
And I've spent my life trying to forget it
I let no substance free me from reality
I sit alone with your ghost and your memory
And I face it
And I take it
And it takes me to that place where pain lives
And it takes me to numbness and indiffernce
Gets to the point where I can't identify faces
But I see scales like a snake of every color imaginable
Ram horns, cat eyes and it's mouth is a blackhole
And I see white and gold hues and indescribable glow
Angelwings on strange beings
And they don't walk, they float
Saint Peter hold the gate for me
I've talked to God and I pray it ain't too late for me
But times have been hard I had to use that gun you gave to me
My eyes are blurry and I just wanna know who's taking me
(Who's taking me) Saint Peter Ladidadida
Eyes wide open I see beings like Set and Ra
And I'm travelling on planes most will never go
Inside the Gisa Pyramid before I come back home
And to my body and I look around when I'm alone
Still got my gun on and I go out and I'm hunting'em
My cousin's killer and altough I am a peaceful man
My aunt's unhappy there's only one way I can deal with that
Kill'em all body for body leaves the world empty
I'm alright with that
I have more loved ones in hell than where I'm at
So keep poking at me
My fire will only grow and I will turn this fucking earth into a blackhole
But you should know
The weight of a body's more than a couple hundred pounds
And you carry that weight with you til you go in the ground
I feel like it's dragging me down so I get stronger
There's no animal on earth with the same hunger
They wanna look at my plate to see what I'm eating
That's the catch
I haven't eaten, I'm starving
So start retreating
They wanna see me on a stretcher
Father forgive them for they don't know better
But I've been doing this forever
And they're all trying to make hits and trying to grow bigger
While I'm in trenches with the killers and my skin's getting thicker
Know the day you go against me is the day you meet God
Cocksuckers still think it's a facade
Bow your heads and close your eyes
Maybe we'll be friends on the other side
Or you can find a place in hell to hide
Cause I'm gonna die
Where I was born
So just bury me on the northend
So I can sleep with that gunfire
That soothing conversation
And when it's my turn to sit down
I'll sit down til I'm done
And when it's my turn to lay down
Well boys it's been fun
As bad as I've been
Is as good as I can be
Say that an play my songs when you go to bury me
Until then it's orchestras played by AK-47s
And it's get right with God you're going to heaven
The devil don't want anyone who fucked with me in his presence
And when you play these words you can feel my essence in the room with you right now
And I bet you're wondering how?
It's the motherfucking Boogeyman
I possess gifts that weren't meant for humans and words can not describe them
And I can not describe her
You've gotta numb every nerve to feel how I feel
You've gotta kill your own kind and steal from the blind
And be willing to do anything if you land in a bind with no bond
And you just sit and have to do the time
Doing life locked in my mind
Take a number and come suffer
I haven't sat with my mother in the better parts of a decade
How cold you think that makes a motherfucker?
Sometimes when the wind blows I wish I could climb inside it
And let it take me where it will and just close my eyes and ride it
And ask for it to drop me in the ocean
And I'll sink so I can be around things that don't think"	Prestigious_Key_5703	follow-up	na	na	na	0.016848886385560036	weak	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.
"Part three 
You said you'd be here forever
And that was us against the world
And I had nothing like dat, ever
And they said you were just a girl
But when I was broken and I gave up
You made me keep pursuing
You said nobody could said it like you
And you made me prove it to 'em
And now I'm a-tearing the world apart
When I come back home you're no longer there
Yet I don't feel alone
Your ghost is still here
Your memory's still here
And I'm contemplating things that you would say if you were near
And it helps me through 'em times, you know that I don't see so clear
And the barrel of my gun is pressed up against my ear
My cousin sees me with th'pistol, says I'm jeopardazing my career
You use the word career like I give a fuck that I'm here
In fact you chose this pick like I'm still willing to hear
But I feel like I should kill myself after I cut off my ear
Can you put all that together
I feel like love don't live here anymore
I don't smile when I see my nephew and he asks me what for
I see his face looks like mine
In a few years he'll be nine
At that age I was put in handcuffs for the first time
So I don't wanna touch his skin
In fact I wanna stay far away don't wanna rub off on him
Don't wanna rub off on anyone so I'm in this room alone

"Trying to become more comfortable in my own body but then also a couple of weeks ago I was walking to my local corner shop and because the weather was sunny/hot, I just had a short sleeved t shirt on with leggings. There's sort of an anxiety/mental health facility/support organization literally a street away from where I live and as I was walking to the shop I passed two girls both who had lanyards on with the name of the same mental health facility/organization near where I live(so I guessed that they worked at the mental health organisation) and they both kind of glanced at my arm and then kind of gave me a confused/kind of annoyed look? I know in a sense that I did this to myself but at the same time it kind of feels depressing that even people who are trained to work with people with anxiety/other mental health struggles, may have judged me for having scars?

"Here’s some honesty: society is not kind towards mentally ill people, no matter how many mental health campaigns you might see. When it comes to self-harm scars, I don’t think I’m reaching when I say that people are definitely judging you in their head. It might be positive judgement (empathy) but it could also be negative (like ""who’s this weakling that cut themselves""). However, I don’t think it’s wrong or toxic to go out showing your scars. They’re there, sh*t happened. It’s more about how you feel in the present moment that matters the most."	gorgeousgoldfish	reply	na	na	na	0.9887188673019409	no	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.
Like the other comment said, society in general isn’t always kind to people with mental illnesses. I think it’s still important to be comfortable in your own body.

There's nothing wrong with showing your scars, they are part of your story. Wrong are the people who judge someone by the past. Society is simply polluted. I know what it's like to live with scars. They are not like yours, it had to do with an accident and my face is burned, would it be okay to cover my face with a bag? Of course not. It's part of me of my story, it's me. Wrong are the people who look and judge me by appearance. To be happy we cannot think about what others think of us. If looks bother you?

"There is nothing wrong with it. Actually I have a close friend with a lot of visible scars. Ofc you may get asked or something, but surprisingly, people just won't care about it. And in most of scenarios, you won't get into any kind of problem. So, don't worry, don't be ashamed.

"For some background context to the shitstorm im about to describe, im 20 M and have never had a “true” or “close” friend my entire life that i could trust or would speak to me or want to meet outside of school. They would happily speak and laugh with me in school (from about 14 to now) but as soon as we were out i was alone and forgotten. This happened with two groups, one because I was way smarter than them all in school and they hated me for it (i never shoved it in their faces).
The other i can only imagine the reason. Ive also never had a girlfriend. These two things combined really make you think you are the issue and are not deserving of love and just destroyed any self confidence i had in the first place, also as a consequence ive never had anyone to confide in or let my emotions out to, i just shove them to the back of my mind and hope to forget). Im not the guy you would look at and think he just sits the and plays video games and eats and drinks shit all day. I eat well, exercise and take care of myself. 

The loneliness never really bothered me in the past but the past year or two its gotten worse and worse to the point now where i cant handle it anymore. It just became something to expect in day to day life, the thoughts that you have nobody that cares and no one to speak to. I just lived my life in a kind of numb and disappointed state but i kind of just learnt to deal with it.
I have recently discovered some more issue that this causes that i have never even thought of before.

They materialised very recently whilst i was on holiday(vacation). There was a girl (who was beautiful) who i would regularly make eye contact with, sometimes it was me catching her looking at me. This allowed my desperatley lonely mind to create a delusion that she liked me, it was the worst and best thing for me. It gave me hope that i  was loveable and gave me somethingthing to look forward to everyday which i had not experienced as far back as i can remember. I this is what people feel everyday i am truly lost. This caused  me to develop limerence which was horrible but made me feel fulfilled, im still working on over coming this. As you can expect nothing came from this potential love. She left about 3 days before me. Yet even then i could not stop thinking about her and what could of been. This then caused me to start something called, “maladaptive daydreaming” as i felt empty without the the hope or feeling of looking forward to seeing her. So i would find myself daydreaming about her seemingly without wanting to. It was a coping mechanism that only caused more pain.  Now its getting out of control and becoming more than i can deal with i feel like im going crazy. I has just showed me truly how lonely i am but the thought of her brings back a feeling of hope that is euphoric and addicting. 

I just needed to get this all off my mind, thanks to anyone who listened and please take my mistakes as a warning and lesson. This is just a snip it into what in feeling inside. Thanks guys I could go into more detail tail but i dont want to bore anyone

"You used a term “limerence”. I had never heard that before so I googled it. Turns out that’s exactly what I’m feeling with my boss at work. She has been there since I started but recently moved into a senior position in my department, I have been the one training her on how to do the role and she’s the only person I pretty much speak to all day at work as she’s the only one in my department that doesn’t work from home, sometimes it feels like work is our little bubble to me. Even though I know she doesn’t and will never see me as anything more than a co-worker.

She brings me so much pain and happiness everyday and I feel so fucked up for even having these thoughts but cannot control them no matter how hard I try. I think about her all the time, in work when I’m next to her and at home, it’s been like this for about 2 months now with varying levels of intensity.

Right now I am only on this Reddit at 2:30 am because I can’t stop thinking about her I was trying to get her off my mind, guess that worked haha. I know it sounds so messed up but I really can’t shake her from my mind, and if I do it’s only temporary. 

But thanks for teaching me the meaning of that word and I really hope we both manage to get over this :)"	Psychological-Lab945	reply	na	na	na	0.9860612154006958	no	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.
I just want to die. I feel like no matter what i do or where I go I’m just never fully happy. I’m always miserable the little bit of joy I had left has just completely faded away and no matter how hard I try I just can’t seem to get it back. I’m tired of continuing in this life that brings me nothing but misery. I wish I could just cease to exist the only reason I don’t wand it is because of how other ppl will feel. Yet I don’t rlly think it’s fair to live on for other ppl. To live on and subject myself to this misery just so that other ppl are not disrupted by my absence is extremely unfair. Everyone says no things will get better and if your gone I’ll miss you but I’m here and feel lonely as ever. Everyone has they’re own life they’re focused on and I feel like I’m just stuck dealing with my depression alone. They say take these meds go to therapy but I’ve been at it for some years and it just doesn’t work. The therapy doesn’t help and the meds don’t do anything to fix the issues I have they just make you a shell of a person. A person who instead of feeling like they’re engulfed in flames is trapped in they’re world while everything is in flames around them. I stand by emotionless while I watch my world crumble to pieces and that’s no better then feeling the heat of it. I can always go to the hospital but at the end of the day that still does nothing for me I just get pumped with different meds and then come out to the same cycle and the same struggles expect this time magnified by 10 because now I have to catch up on bills. I feel like I don’t belong anywhere not with friends not with family I have a shitty relationship with my parents a non existent one with my family and friends are to happy about life to want to continue to be around me. Though understandable these are the same friends that come to me with they’re problems and I am expected to put everything aside and help them deal with theirs. Yet no one is willing to even lend an ear or a shoulder for me to cry on. I rlly just feel like everyone wants me around for they’re own personal selfish reasons. I’m always the friend that gets called when they need advice I’m always around when they’re in a crisis I’m always the one they can count on but when I’m in need there’s no one. Everyone’s to busy. I stopped being that friend for ppl and guess how many friends I have now? Guess how many friends “needed a break from my friendship” People don’t care about me they just care about what I can offer them and once I can no longer offer that I’m pretty much useless. And this has been going on for as long as I can remember. I’m tired of being used like an object. I’m a person yet watch animals get treated better than me.

"about a year ago i was going through a bad time in life i had this girlfriend that was so carrying for me she was so nice and she knew i been treated bad in my last relationship so she would always like he like i won't do that and i love you i promise i won't hurt you, anyways we been together for a while everything is fine but, i had a class with my best friend girlfriend and she would tell me how she thought he was cheating on her and stuff and i would listen because i didn't have anything else to do but then as i listened the dots kinda aligned for us i hate to admit but in a way we liked each other but because we had our relationship nothing happy it was also so wrong she was my best friend girlfriend but we just didn't open up about it but i could tell she liked me and i liked her, but one day i go to class and she calls my name i look over at her and she's like hey cheat your phone, and when i look at my phone it's screenshots of my best friend, and my girlfriend like flirting tell how they lied each other and all this and the other you get it but later that day i waited till the school day was over she had softball practice that day and i text her"" where over"" and then send the screenshot,she started to like freak out and stuff and she said she passed out and stuff and that she cried a lot, but i didn't care i wasn't sad i was okay and i felt bad for not carrying but now that i look back at it is because i like that one girl at the time but days past and me and my best friend ex and i get even more close and we make a ""plan"" to act like we was dating, this is where it gets bad so just try to understand while i was acting to date her i have also been texting my ex form that before relationship and she was begging for me back and she was stressing me out she would say things like you can't wait you have to date me now or i'll just leavr but i didn't like her but i loved the thought that she needed me( this was at the time i promise i am no longer like this) but anyways my and my best friend ex are ""acting"" posting each other holding hands yk being bold and it was so good but i fucked it up, one day before the class i got to see her me and my old ex sit together and she was stressing me out and i said fine we can date not thinking any of it, next class im with my best friend ex and we like start to joke and then touch each other and we ended up kissing completely forgetting i got back with my ex 💀but the day goes on and then at the end if the day my and my girlfriend are together and my best friend ex pulls her away and asked if me and her was dating and she said yes and then she ended up telling her that we kissed and i felt so bad i didn't know what to do i was in my mind and i lost then that day,she forgave me and we was good till something else happen i might make a other part to do this because there's so much more that happened ne after with other girls and more drama later on lmk if i should?"	euahrjB	post	15.583780622870805	male	White	0.9932832717895508	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

"hey everyone… today is my 22nd birthday and i received 6 messages (one of those being from my dentist). 

it’s a stupid thing to complain about, but every year as my birthday approaches i absolutely start dreading it. the depression usually hits on august 1st and starts building until the 7th. 

i like to think i have a good group of friends and a lot of good acquaintances… but for some reason, every year, no one remembers my birthday.

 i wake up to a couple messages from family, but nothing from my friends. i know they know it’s my birthday because we all have facebook and snapchat, and even instagram has started showing a special birthday filter on profile pictures. i always text them happy birthday. i don’t know why i don’t get the same energy. 

i have celebrated my birthday alone the past 3 years. i’m sure i could do something to fix the issue, but doing that makes me feel desperate. i don’t want to remind people i exist, i want them to remember me"	Classic_Light8289	post	34.643666634335	male	White	0.997334897518158	na	na	na	9	sad	no prediction.

"Happy birthday!!! I can absolutely understand where you’re coming from. I dread my birthday as well; I almost never feel like I get the attention I wish I would get from the loved ones in my life. It never feels like enough, and considering how lonely I can get at other times, it feels so much worse on a day that’s supposed to be centered around me.

I wish I had some concrete advice, but I find what helps me is keeping busy. I still work on my birthday. I take joy in doing stuff for myself like watching a favorite movie and/or ordering takeout from a favorite restaurant. I hope you are able to find some traditions that suit you and brings you joy.

Also, when you have a better day, maybe explicitly tell some of your close friends what you want? I told my BFF a few months before my thirtieth birthday that I wanted a big party to be thrown for me and gave some guidance on how to do it but said I was going to trust him to get it together.

"i’ve been struggling a lot, it’s been almost a year since my dad died and i’ve been trying my hardest to get through. i do good in school and i see my friends but sometimes it’s like they think i’m all better.

recently i’ve gotten into this huge fight with a friend and a boy i was interested in. it was over a minor issue, but the way my friend is talking to me is just so cruel and callous and i don’t know what to do. it’s just making me feel so worthless and unloveable.

all i want is to be held in the arms of a big strong man while i cry my eyes out. every guy i talk to it just never works out and it’s starting to feel like i’m the problem. i feel so useless and just like shitty
the friends i do have i feel like im annoying them by being upset and talking to them about it. i feel like they’re pretending to care because they all just pity me

"To everyone around me, I’ve been doing well. I have a high GPA, I’m holding multiple co-curricular positions in my university, I make ends meet with a smile on my face no matter how difficult.

But the reality is I don’t see a future. I don’t have parents, I don’t have a boyfriend. Sometimes when I get these feelings, I think “You’re being ungrateful to the family that you do have. So many people have it worse than you.” But still, I don’t know how to keep going. I am so stressed and depressed and I can’t seem to see a way out. I tried to commit suicide last year but it didn’t work and now I’m just sad and not brave enough to try and end it again.

So my plan is to work myself until I probably die from the stress. I want the highest GPA and the best club prize from my university and multiple internships and scholarships and an exchange semester in a foreign university.

i had no one to celebrate my 18th birthday with. My parents were just splitting up and couldn’ be in the same room together, my boyfriend cheated on me, and i cut off my friends a year prior because my mental health was a shit show. i had lots of regrets, especially regarding my 18th. On my 19th, things were better and I had few people to celebrate with. But i chose to celebrate on my own at the beach to avoid any disappointment. Now i’m coming up on my 21st and I am stuck in the same boat. Don’t let these things bring you down! For years I have swelled on this, and it’s another one of my regrets. I wish I wouldn’t have felt so bad about myself and my situation. I wish I would have forced myself to go out and treat myself. Whatever that means to you.

"I can’t explain it but I really really want to cry. But I just can’t. Everyday I feel really anxious and really stressed out all the time. Everytime I want to release my emotions it always comes out as anger, never sadness. 

This next part is just me ranting about my life. 

Also I smoke weed all the time everyday. I’m really struggling and going downhill. I’ve tried to get help from therapists, family, friends, and drugs. But nothing helps. Sometimes I don’t even want to get help because my social anxiety completely overwhelms me and I’m too nervous to talk to people. The only thing that used to help me was weed, but now that’s become an addiction that I can’t control. I’m so stressed out and I need someone to talk to or something.

I always knew that I wasn’t going to be as well as any other person, but actually being told what you’ve kept in the back of your mind is disconcerting.

"Probably more answer than you were looking for:

It depends. I think about this so much. Almost daily. Two ways I'd want to. First is sending my current mind back into my younger body. Totally relive my life over again with what I know now. Be better to my parents, avoid mistakes. Set myself on a path to be happy.

The other way would be physically going back in time and mentoring my younger self. I'd move in with my family. Help them generally, but guide younger me's development.

"My father likes to demotivate me and discourage from everything I am passionate about. I liked a certain sport as a kid and he vehemently revolted and said I couldn't play at professional level and that I might as well give up already (this was when I was 13)

Due to solitude, loneliness and lack of friends in real life, I found films to be a wonderful pastime and became really passionate about it. I'm an avid cinema enjoyer. Unfortunately, he's saying I should completely stop ""wasting my time"" on it.

"I just don’t really know anymore, I’ve dealt with stuff for a long time now, and somehow I find myself venting here once in a while.

Life has been a complete mess for me, I am a M in my 20s, and really I am just so tired I’d love nothing more than to end it all.

Nothing ever worked out for me, nothing. I ended up as a complete dissappointment as a son, brother, friend. I am a really dull, boring, shy person and I can’t find myself belonging anywhere. Up until recently I kept thinking my life went downhill from my 16s,17s. But recently while reminiscing unpleasant memories came back. I was practically bullied most of the time, life wasn’t really a sweet or normal ride for me at all.

Before I went to live on my own, all the bullying, and shunning was bearable, at least I was a “good kid” doing well academically, now I’ve messed up that too. Everytime I go to my hometown I see the disappointment on my parent’s, I hate it how I wasn’t really there to support my siblings being the oldest brother and all.

If it weren’t for my family I would be long gone now, and I just can’t keep thinking that ending it is so selfish of me, I don’t really want them to feel sad or hurt over me. At the same time, I just want to end all the pain, there isn’t one field in life I am good at, I just want to end it all so fucking much, everyday I contemplate it more and more. To make it fucking better I am addicted to 420, but now even that isn’t helping anymore.

"it’s okay to vent, we all need to sometimes. 
ending it all may seem like the easy way out but you deserve to live ! there are so many things you have to look forward to. there are so many friends and lovers that you have yet to meet, food you haven’t eaten yet 

i know how you feel but i promise you aren’t a disappointment. your family loves you a lot. good grades isn’t a defining factor for your worth. you will find something g you’re good at, in the mean time try going on a walk or bike ride, or just baking something. do something small and fun for yourself because YOU DESERVE IT 

i love and care about you!!!! i know you don’t know me but i understand you. i’m sorry you were bullied, people can be so so cruel but that has nothing to do with you and everything to do with them. whoever was mean to you has something going on either at home or in their own head, and they’re taking it out on you

i hope this wasn’t too cheesy but i hope you start feeling a little better day by day. i love and believe in you. if 4/20 isn’t helping, take a T break if you can or try only using it with intention. like no wake and bake but maybe like before you go to bed or to help you relax

I read the question wrong as i haven't slept in 2 days , my answer would in reality be no , you are allowed to feel upset , you are allowed to feel sorry , but there's a condition and that is that you have to get back up on your feet no matter how many times you are knocked down , it might seem really hard and you might be tempted every few moments to just give up but don't give up because the future you relies on you and you are the only one who can change his/her life and he would be thanking or blaming you on the actions you take today so always choose it wisely , remember my friend , you get life once so cherish it with the utmost care and love yourself , try to be motivated from inside and if you can't then I'm always here to help	gorgeousgoldfish	reply	na	na	na	0.004671151749789715	weak	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.
"I am set on ending my pathetic life. I'm going to buy a gun and shoot myself, but right before that I'll jump off a bridge to guarantee I die. I've had enough of this miserable existence, and I absolutely despise my parents for making me.

I currently have a mere $30 in my bank account. I'm starting a new job in 2 weeks, and I'll use my first paycheck to buy a gun and get the fuck out of this miserable existence. I just cant do this shit any longer. I've been suicidal since I was 12 years old, and now 10 years later absolutely nothing has gotten better. I don't even want to go into detail why I want to end my life. I just want to get the fuck out. I envy the non-existent. I wish I was aborted. Why, just why did I have to be born into this place. I don't want to have anything to do with this fucking shithole planet. I'm done.

I cant fucking wait for the day I finally leave this place. What an absolute joke. I wont be missing out on anything by committing suicide. There's nothing to look forward to. Nothing is fun about living. Nothing is fun about death too, but at least I wont have to suffer any longer. Just why did I have to be the one to live. My parents had 2 aborted children, but of course my shitty luck makes me the one that lives. FUCK. I'm just tired of crying everyday wishing I was the one that was aborted. The only way to fucking solve this is by ending this existence.

I feel bad for my partner. We both thought we could actually make this last, but that's not possible. The only reason I haven't killed myself this past year is because I didn't want to hurt them, but now I'm over it all. It sucks but they'll move on eventually and find someone else. I cant let other people trap me in this hell, no matter how much I like them. I need to break free and get out. This life isn't worth living. I refuse to suffer any longer. It's a wrap."

https://youtu.be/Ri6OfW-0SN8 addiction is tough because before you even pick it you have the thought of you doing it and not if you tell yourself I’ll smoke weed but not any of the other drugs cause their kinda up there then you’re more likely to use when it’s around. Addiction can be anything too because too much of anything is bad for your health it’s like eating chips all day you probably won’t eat chips the next day or if you really like chips then it looks like you always got chips.

"I just turned 18 a few months ago and I’m heading off to college. It has just hit the one year anniversary of the most gut wrenching day of my life. I worked at a rehab center/nursing home for a year since I was freshly 17 going into my junior year. I was frequently working in the dementia floor and got attached to a few of my residents. One in particular stuck with me. 

She was an older woman whose memory wasn’t the best. I would take care of her every single day and she never remembers my name but remembered me of course. At some point we gave up on introductions and I told her to call em whatever she liked. She called me Steve for a while (her son that passed) but she settled on calling me Rochelle (her grand daughter) or just baby.  I was going into my senior year of high school and wouldn’t be able to work u til the next summer. 

One day when she told me to come close. I thought she was going to tell me one of her dirty jokes but it was a hug and a kiss on the head. I thought it was the best time to tell her. It was my last day after all. I told her I wouldn’t see her for a while and to make sure she is being taken care of. She asked me where I was going I told her school are reminded her how old I was. She keeps thinking in 25. She said I was going to college next year to be a nurse something I told her a long time ago. I told her yes. 

She said ok. And told me to keep my grades up and to be a good girl. I told her I would and I kissed her goodbye. When I left the room she said something that o made me cry on the spot. 

“See you tomorrow baby”

She had already forgotten what we talked about and would wonder where I was. 

She died of a stroke a few days later. I’m going off to college now around the same time last year and all I can think about is her."	Lemonysweet23	post	34.640783601338164	male	White	0.014131737872958183	na	na	na	3	sad	failed

"Hello people of Reddit, my name is Kameron (they/them). I feel like I have a lot of things I need to get off my chest. No one has to respond or comment, I’m making this post to maybe come to terms with a lot of stuff that has been going on in my life. 

For some reason today, I feel like I’m drowning or maybe stuck, maybe even not like a real person. I have feelings of me being a shadow a lot. Like I’m not supposed to be here. I struggle a lot with self harm and suicidal ideation. Which is crazy to me because I work in a inpatient mental health facility. But most of the time I feel like I should be a patient and not an employee.

There are days that go by where I’m so close to ending my life. For reasons I don’t even understand. For things I don’t understand. There is this constant feeling of hopelessness and worthlessness. Which I feel like drives a lot of my actions. I do have both a counselor and a psychiatrist, but so far I don’t think anything is helping. I don’t think I’m worth saving. 

My body image issues are also really bad. To the point where I force myself to throw up after I eat anything. I hate the way I look. I hate the way I act. I want to be someone else. I don’t want to be stuck in this body anymore. 

I have texted the suicide hotline a lot but honestly they fucking suck.

"Male, 30, Somerville, MA, Grip in Film Industry

TL;DR: recent events have gotten me bummed out with dating/romance, how do I make something work with someone

CW: thoughts of self-harm

I’ve never had much luck with women. I never had a girlfriend in high school, and after one too many in-person rejections, I switched over to doing online dating almost exclusively when I was 23. With online dating, I’d build up the women I was attracted to into wonderful partners in my head, and I’d fantasize about being in a relationship with them - but then I’d meet them in person, and we’d have zero chemistry, or they’d find someone else before I could work up the courage to message them. If they (online dating or people I know in real life) just wanted to stay friends, I’d stay friends with them, because people keep telling me that a lot of great relationships start out as great friendships - but nothing romantic ever came out of any of them. The only people who ever seemed interested in me were women that I wasn’t attracted to. At one point, when I was 23, I felt particularly burned out and drained, and felt like each new rejection had physically taken ten years off of my life expectancy. I started to think that I might actually end up alone. I even toyed with the thought of just giving up entirely, because instead of worrying day and night about whether or not girl of the week was attracted to me, I’d have the comfort and security of *knowing* that I’d end up alone. Besides, some of the happiest, most satisfying, most fulfilling periods of growth in my life have been when I was single and not actively looking for a partner.

Then, in 2019/2020, after fantasizing about a girl for a long time, not receiving a response when I finally worked up the courage to message her, and feeling empty for months afterwards, lockdown happened. After having had to work numerous Production Assistant jobs that I was frankly embarrassed to still have to do (I still wasn’t in the union at this point), I was out of work for months. This is incredibly privileged of me to say, but it was good for me. I was able to rest, take time off from dating, and get caught up watching movies and tv series I’d been meaning to see. After talking to my psychiatrist, I also agreed to go back on medication - more specifically, I started taking Zoloft for anxiety. It was an absolute game-changer for me.

Then, towards the end of 2020, I went back to work, and working on film sets / watching movies / working on my own editing projects became my main priority. I actually started seeing a girl through CoffeeMeetsBagel, first through Google Meets, and then in person. She was fun to hang out with, and we moved onto making out by the third-in person date and touching her breasts / my groin by the fourth in-person date, but in March 2021, after the fourth in-person date (seven dates total), she cut things off because I didn’t communicate or text enough. It bummed me out for a bit, but that’s mostly because I was shocked that *she* was the one to end things - to be honest, I wasn’t really physically attracted to her, and I had a hard time picturing a future with her. She talked about children (she wants to be a teacher) *constantly*, even mentioning in our last date how she wanted to adopt children. All in all, even though I was sad, I realized it was probably for the best.

From that point forward, dating took the back burner. I haven’t gone on a date, virtually or in-person, since. I worked as a COVID PA on a feature film for months, and used the enormous amount of free time the job gave me to edit a trailer-style video mashup tribute to Ari Aster, one of my favorite directors. It’s not perfect, it’s probably too long, and not many people have seen it, but I’m so incredibly proud of it, and even prouder that I had the skills to will it into existence. There was even a cute Scenic Artist I made a point to talk to while doing the rounds at my job, and she inspired a screenplay idea that I have yet to actually write, but it feels like I can almost touch it, it feels so within the realm of possibility (much to my dismay, she already had a boyfriend). I repeatedly began to compile movie clips for future director mashup tributes, only to get distracted by downloading movies from other directors.

Late 2021 to 2023 proved to be enormously transformational. I started using more groan-inducing puns at work, and found that it made me more comfortable around people (or among people on film sets, at least), and that helped me develop my sense of humor in general. On one gig in September 2022, I even meet a girl who I thought was cute, who liked Ari Aster movies, and who laughed at my jokes - but that was for one day, and because she doesn’t have a huge social media presence, I haven’t interacted with her since, so I mostly just pine from afar. I finally moved out of my childhood home in late October 2022, after an acquaintance / friend / something in between of mine from high school posted on Facebook looking for a roommate in Somerville. At one Production Assistant gig, I finally met someone in my craft in IATSE who expressed willingness to sponsor me - I was finally accepted into the union on April 25th, 2023, after almost four and a half years of trying to get in. Hell, I even managed to (kind of) curb my porn addiction, to the point where I don’t even really look at porn that much anymore (but that was only because I freaked out upon realizing that I’d spent nearly half my nest egg on OnlyFans custom videos - and I’m still waiting on *four* of them! 😬). Work is slow because of the writers’ strike, I’m a little concerned about how much money is in my bank account, and I’m not doing as many creative things as I’d like - but overall, I’m doing okay, and I’m getting by. I don’t give a whole lot of attention to my dating profiles (or to dating in general).

Then, someone from a previous pro bono shoot asks if I’d be willing to help out on his pro bono shoot from July 22nd to July 23rd and from July 28th to July 29th. I say something along the lines of “sure, I can probably help out for a few days” - and of course, I get roped into being a department head.

I’m going into this shoot with zero expectations - at best, I feel resignation (“I promised to help him out, so I ought to stay on. It’ll probably be fun, but I wish I was getting paid - but then again, they’re mostly college students or recent grads”); at worst, I actively dread it (“fuuuuck why did I agree to this? The gaffer is also gonna be the sound guy, and I’m not gonna have many people to help me as key grip. Do I have enough experience to be able to do my job?”).

Then I met her.

While we do go overtime quite frequently, the shoot actually goes remarkably smoothly for me - people laugh at my jokes, my pun game is stellar, and I’m able to do my job pretty well (that, and it’s a film set run by college students, so…). I don’t think much of her at first - she’s cool, she’s cute, and she works as both make-up, costumes, and 2nd AD on the shoot (though she gives the actors quite a lot of direction) - but that’s really about it.

The second day of the shoot, I interact with her more, and I realize both how pretty and playful and funny she is, and how comfortable I feel teasing her and making fun of her.

From that point on, I can’t get her out of my mind. When shooting resumes on July 28th, I see her again - but she mentions off-hand that she just broke up with a guy two days ago after he gaslit her and showed up at her job. Fuck, I thought. I have to wait before asking her out. But that’s not the end of the world, I guess.

During this leg of the shoot, I admit I became a bit more self-conscious, because she also talks to one of the actors a lot - he’s a nice, funny dude who’s also good-looking and manly in a Teddy Roosevelt sort of way - and I admit that I occasionally slip into the “overly-polite nice guy following her like a lost puppy” routine that I performed with other women I’d fallen for instead of teasing her and joking around with her. And it wracks my brain. What if it doesn’t work out with her? It might not work out. The others didn’t. But I also get to spend a lot of time with her, and my attraction deepens - she’s funny, playful, I felt comfortable teasing her and joking around with her (sometimes), she laughed at some of my jokes, she’s outgoing and bubbly, she’s interested in movies and tv, she does stage management (which I can kind of relate to and talk to her about because I do theatre lighting / stagehand gigs when film work is slow), she works as a teacher when she’s not in school and is passionate about helping kids (though recently she told me she wants to transition into film because she feels unappreciated by her students and the company she works for), she’s incredibly intelligent and articulate, she’s driven and ambitious, she does screenwriting, and while she clearly doesn’t take shit from people, she’s also an incredibly, genuinely sweet and friendly person even though she’s had a string of relationships that didn’t work out and experienced at least two or three miscarriages (one when she was concerningly young). How much self-control and willpower does it take to be that kind and sweet after experiencing all that?

When I think about it now, I realize I haven’t felt this way about anyone else for almost nine years - I’m just kind of in awe of her, and it feels like I respect her and that it’s a selfless kind of attraction. She’s everything I could ever want in a woman. She inspires me to be a better version of myself. She makes me want to finish my video tribute to Lars von Trier, and to pick back up a screenplay idea I’d come up with back in my last semester of college in 2017 (I was too lazy to actually put much effort into writing it, and when I filmed a scene I actually had written, it was too long, and one of my actors hammed up his performance). She even inspires me to want to actually begin writing that screenplay that the aforementioned scenic artist inspired. It feels like a more legitimate love, because this isn’t just a dating profile - this is a real person.

But she says she wants to move out to LA within a year because she wants to write this miniseries about the miscarriages that women suffer (such as the ones that they don’t even know are miscarriages) and the effects that it can have on them. And it killed me, but it also made me re-evaluate whether or not I wanted to move to LA - I’d undoubtedly get more film set work, I know a lot of people from Emerson who’ve moved out there, my union status could (possibly) be transferrable, and even my mom (who’s not exactly a huge fan of my film career) has repeatedly said I should at least visit LA to see whether or not I like it. Could she be the motivator I need to move there? Is she worth it?

On the fourth day of shooting (we ended up shooting on the 30th as well), after we’d wrapped for the day, a few of us were smoking together, and I asked them how they came up with screenwriting ideas that they were excited about. She at some point mentioned that she thought that I would have a good grasp of dialogue and that I had a great grasp of social cues, which I was super surprised to hear from anyone - because that REALLY doesn’t sound like me - and I was like “really?”, and most of the people in the group were like “yeah!”, and she started listing off all of these really nice things about me, like how I was witty because I was able to fire off incredibly lame puns all the time, which also meant that I was good at reading the room, and she said that I seemed literary (I think) and educated and smart.

That night, I talk to the director about my feelings for the girl (I’ve had heart-to-heart convos with him before), and he advised me to at least wait a month before making a move. Not a bad idea.

The next day, I leave the set early so I can get back to my parents place (I’d been looking after the place while they were on vacation), leave food out for my cats, pick my car up from the shop, transfer my gear back into my own car, drive back home to Somerville, and prep for my upcoming gig, which is helping the electrical crew at a theater in Cambridge strike the set of a major musical that had just wrapped at that venue. Before I go, she invites us to her performance in a tribute to Ruth Gordon that her professor is putting on on Friday, August 4th. She’s not enthusiastic about it, because she’s doing it as a favor, and the haphazard rehearsal schedule forced her to temporarily leave our set early (she came back, though).

The work I do that week at the theater is absolutely grueling. But at the advising of my close friend / wing-person, I decide to go to her performance, because it’s showing support for her. I even try to invite the director of the shoot so that it’ll be less intimidating for the girl, and so even if the girl can’t do anything afterwards, he and I can at least stay and watch the showings of Harold and Maude and Rosemary’s Baby - but the director twisted his ankle the previous night, so he can’t make it.

I go to the show, and, as expected, it’s excruciating to sit through, self-indulgent, and very thrown-together. After the performance ends, I wait in the audience for a bit so she can get her stuff together, and because I know that the cast and crew members are gonna get swarmed by audience members. Afterwards, I go up to her, hug her as I greet her, and joke around and talk with her as I help her and several of the cast members clear the stage. She mentions that the film set went to shit after I left - the couple who owned the house we were filming at had apparently gotten into a huge fight, and both she and the director had to act as intermediaries. She’s too tired to stick around for either of the movies showing that night, and as we talk, it gets to her personal life, and apparently the aforementioned actor I was worried about had made a move on her - but not only had she just broken up with a guy, but she was also wondering if she was gay. She said she’d been with women before, and had felt more comfortable with them, and had told the actor that she didn’t think they had those vibes. I then said that I’d have asked her out, but that she had just broken up with someone, and that she had shit she needed to figure out. She said she was in a friendzone mindset at the moment, but that she thought there was no reason I couldn’t find someone. I said I’d ask her out sometime in the future. She said she’d be more available to hang out in the coming week, and to hit her up if I was interested in hanging out.

I felt dead for most of the day on August 5th. I’d promised a girl I’d met through Bumble, but had reconnected with through work, that I’d help her move her studio across the hall, in an effort on my part to keep myself busy and social, and so if nothing happened with the girl from the shoot, I’d at least have some other mildly-social engagement to keep me occupied. I did a lot more heavy lifting than I’d anticipated, and felt so low and borderline catatonic by the end of it. On the ride home, my thoughts turned to purchasing a pack of cigarettes and using them to burn myself.

(I didn’t buy the pack of cigarettes, and I realized that that really wasn’t a healthy way of thinking, so I’ve been thinking about checking into a psych ward for a few days, but I’m worried about the cost).

\*\*\*\*\*

I’m just so exhausted by all of this. Every time I put myself out there for someone I like, either something comes up, they’re not interested, or I screw it up. It just happens time and time and time again, and it’s just so demoralizing and humiliating and soul-crushing, and it makes me feel like less of a person and that something is just fundamentally wrong with me. Even not trying to be romantic with them and just staying platonic never leads to anything more. Why does it work for everyone else, and never for me? Do I still have a chance with her? Will I ever find anyone? Alternatively, can I find enough happiness and contentment that I won’t be overwhelmingly lonely if I stop dating entirely and just accept that I’m going to end up alone? What do I do?

I just want to find someone who I love, and who mutually loves me back. As masochistic as it might seem, I want her, or someone like her, who makes me feel and want that intensely, because it feels good and selfless to want someone like that who can motivate you to be the best version of yourself that you can be."

"""Dating"" is a mistake. Don't do it. You don't just do some mercenary audition for a life partner. That's a recipe for failure, it's incredibly stupid, and it says a lot about the dystopian situation we're all in where meaningful relationships with other people are impossible.  


You need a social mileu where hanging out with someone you don't know well makes sense. You need friends -- this is an incredibly aspirational ambition in an increasingly atomized, alienated world. 


tl;dr: if you can't find a way to have a social life, you're out of the running for a romantic life."	Kubrickian1993	reply	na	na	na	0.9867223501205444	no	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.

Briefly everyone around me has better life than me. Like they go festivals, have fun, summer is holiday for them, they somehow have lots of money to spare, they have girlfriend that they meet everyday, sex life, good look. Besides that I can't go anywhere as I can't afford, just mentally break and cry, summer is time to work as my school goes off, I have to earn money to spend that they spend in a day, long-distance relationship that I think to marry just to see her, barely seeing her, I haven't seen her for months because of my job, sex is anniversary shit to me like if I have one time for year I would celebrate it, and as you can guess I look like shit. I just wondering did I deserved this I mean it was obvious that my life would be suck since my childhood but I was hoping it to be better, not worse. I wish I could leave everything behind and go to hell as a continuation of my misery but I love my girl friend so much that I can't do that to her. Still I hate my life and cry about it.

"I’ve never felt so low before… there are many reasons for this but to name some things that happened recently. Also I’m a f and 20 

-I moved 5hr away from family for college (regret being so far now)

-my grandpa passed away

-my parents divorced and my mother moved out

-I lost a friend due to friendship breakup 

-another friend is slowly drifting away as she is now going to be a mom of not 1 but 2 

-my boyfriend of 3 years broke up with me 

-I lose my job

-I barely have money for rent / tuition 

-my new roommate sucks and I don’t love my living situation 

-I’ve been sick for 2 months in bed with mono and strep on and off


I feel like I have no future goals besides trying to finish college. I have little friends. I have no energy to hang out with people.

I just need someone to listen to me for a little bit. I don’t know what is wrong with me. I suffer constantly with very severe depression and anxiety. My life is torture. I’m never good enough. I’m always alone. I wish more than anything I could just be a well respected person who is fun, strong, and smart. I wish I had a good family. And most of all, I wish I was just loved. I’m so tired. I just want peace. The constant heartache has slowly been destroying me for years. I’ve tried everything from therapy to medication. And unfortunately, it doesn’t work. I accept that I am just doomed. I always have been. I can try and improve myself all that I want but I’ll always be the insane and messed up person I’ve always been. This life needs to end soon.

no... since my parents think that I'm in good emotional health or whatever it's called but I can't just talk to my friends and since it has helped me a little yes...

"Borrowing a family member’s Reddit account to write this.

6:45 AM. I should’ve been asleep seven hours ago. But I am sad and feel depressed. I was diagnosed with CLL leukemia a year ago and lately I just feel invisible. I was part of a weekly virtual club meeting for three years, but I didn’t have a WebCam, and I am slightly socially anxious plus the meeting was mainly professionals, and I am just interested in the subject matter so I silently attended for three years. I didn’t miss a single week. There’s about 30 to 40 people who show up and most only talk maybe one minute at most during the meetings. I’ve never talked a single time in three years, and it never seemed to be an issue.

Suddenly, after three years, the organizer decides he’s going to unceremoniously remove people who have not been participating actively online. 

So I wrote him a 20 page letter explaining how I participated behind the scenes. I actually did. I supported other members by buying their products and voting when they were up for a certain award. And I reached out with questions and compliments, but the organizer didn’t know any of this. So I wrote a 20 page letter explaining how his two hour meeting is the only thing that brings me happiness and health. 

I explained what his meetings have meant to me, and how I actually have participated. I had even written to him over the three years every now and then congratulating him on an anniversary or thanking him for allowing me to participate. So he didn’t know me personally but he knew of me, but he almost never ever replied to any of my notes.  He would just send me the link to the zoom meeting every week.

Due to my diagnosis I am almost 100% isolated and never leave the house and for two hours of the week his meetings brought me peace. It’s ironic because I actually alternated during his meeting between my support group and his meeting, and I sent him the link showing that the support group is at the exact same time and because of that, I need to go back-and-forth between meetings, and therefore could not actively participate online.

You would think somebody would have empathy. Would have sympathy. Would have heart. I do no harm by silently sitting in his meeting. No harm at all. But he wanted participation so I brainstorm and offered ways that I could participate, thinking outside the box. I even offered to come to meeting of the minds if he had other ideas. I even offered a financial contribution if desired.

he never responded. Not once. I’ve tried to write a number of times over the last month practically pleading with him to let me come back to the meetings. I did nothing wrong. Nothing wrong at all. And if he didn’t want me to come back, it’s his prerogative but at least acknowledge reading my notes. Say you’re sorry I have cancer and I’m going through a hard time say something. And then thought maybe, just maybe, my notes are ending up in his spam folder. Even though I wrote from multiple email accounts. So I reached out to other members and briefly explained how I was trying to get in touch with the head guy and could they forward the note on my behalf. These guys are professionals and are very well-known in the community. They all supported me and said I should be allowed to stay in the meetings and that they would forward my note to the organizer asking him to please respond.

But he never responded. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Bupkiss.

Oh I tried again and again and I don’t understand how a person has a heart to completely ignore. I know for a fact that the other peoples’ note did not also go into his spam. His wife conduct meetings with him. I appealed to both of them. How can someone be so heartless as to not even respond?

I broke down crying tonight. I put in so much effort into this and other things. And people never ever ever respond. Maybe nobody will respond to this Reddit post either. Why would you respond to an invisible person? 🥵"	_TheWhiteWalker_	reply	na	na	na	0.985273540019989	no	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.

Listen to me. I have no idea what you've gone through and/or your reason to try to plan this. I love you. I don't even know who you are and I love you. I'm not going to try to preach to you about some religion or something like that. This is a genuine human connection. No matter what you have been through. You don't deserve to die like this. Even if no one cares about you. My heart is breaking reading this post and knowing that you plan to do this, again not knowing you or who you are. I'm slowly learning through out my life that we all need to have compassion and love towards one another. I know that even what I've said so far might not phase you. Just try to hear me out. I promise you if you don't go through with this. Your life will turn out in ways you never even dreamed of. You can have it all. And it is all waiting for you. Please rethink this.

I have a couple of relatives in canada (where I’m going for my masters) and a few in US too so Ik worst case scenario I go to them for a while but it just feels so awful right now. I can’t quite explain this feeling. I feel sad, scared, afraid, lonely but a part of me looks forward to it too, that part knows that it’s a difficult decision and it’ll be very tough in the beginning but I’ll be okay. 
I just wanted to let it out here because I don’t want to worry my parents.

 Even though I'm only approaching my late twenties, I'm starting to feel really depressed. I would do anything to go back to my early 20s, I feel like I haven't done much with my life and have wasted it, I'm full of regrets. I miss being young so much,  I miss when parents used to treat me like a child, even though it was annoying at the time but I kind of miss it now. Hence, I even wish I could go just 6 months back  , I don't know why. Year by year, the older I get I keep losing hope over time. I wish I appreciated that time because I miss it so much and am feeling constantly anxious over aging and over what the future brings me cause I feel like I have no future either. I wish I could back to the time when I was 22, still in college and hopeful about my future. And besides, my biological clock is ticking as a woman since our worth goes down after the age of 25 and we hit the wall, we are supposed to be married with kids by now which I still haven't done, which is making me suicidal .	flowery9777	post	18.096179657510255	female	White	0.9962628483772278	na	na	na	6	sad	no prediction.

">I feel like I haven't done much with my life and have wasted it,

nah. a life you have enjoyed wasting isn't a wasted life.

>Year by year, the older I get I keep losing hope over time.

It is what you make it. there are people, places, and things out there that can fill you with joy and enthusiasm for life. it just takes braking cycles of behavior to go and find them.

>since our worth goes down after the age of 25

oof, that's some depressing internalized sexism. you are worth more everyday you grow & learn.

>we are supposed to be married with kids by now which I still haven't done, which is making me suicidal .

that's frankly a silly reason to want to die.

i'm a little more sympathetic to those who can't get out of their marriage and families who want to die.

you shouldn't let other people define what happiness and success is to you. treat yourself better, you've earned it."	flowery9777	reply	na	na	na	0.9962628483772278	weak	strong	no	na	sad	failed
"It is no easy thing, but we all must grapple with the fact that youth is fleeting. Though you want to turn back time to your early twenties, you would need your current memories and experience to get a different outcome. Therein lies the paradox: We need wisdom to make the most of youth, but we only gain wisdom with age. We all handle this truth in our own ways. Nevertheless, I assure you that your ""worth"" as a woman does NOT diminish with age. I would urge you to first consider that true value comes from how you treat others. Who do you value in your life? Surely it is the people who love and treat you well. If you are not convinced by that philosophical position, then let me still address your immediate concerns: 1) You have plenty of time left to build a family. I've known many women who became mothers in their 30s and even 40s -- they found the same satisfaction as any of their younger counterparts. 2) Beauty is truly timeless, just look around and you will see for yourself that this is true. 

I am just a stranger on the internet, my opinions are far from definitive, but I resonate with your concerns and want you to know that this anxiety is normal and even healthy. Everything will resolve"	flowery9777	reply	na	na	na	0.9962628483772278	weak	no	no	na	sad	failed

I don’t think any form of dying is truly painless. Maybe physically so. But you’re obviously still in emotional/mental pain. Not to mention the loss you’re going to go through by taking your own life. Like everyone else here said, we are strangers but we don’t want anyone to die. You need to try and talk to someone. Someone who doesn’t know you. They can’t be biased and can give you honest opinions and feedback and solutions or coping skills. There’s always something else you can try before you take your own life. And as a parent, if your someone’s daughter, no matter how bad you think the relationship is, they are going to ache every day missing you. It’s just the way we are.

I have no idea what you must be going through to take this path, suicide is never the answer, even if you think it is. Wouldn't you want the honor of not giving up, to keep fighting.

Your mother may seem like a burden but she does not hate you, she loves you so much and couldn't imagine living a day without you, your child, you're not pathetic at all. Trust me, life is shit, but you're so young and you have a whole life ahead of you, the only thing worth keeping. You can get help for whatever you're going through to clean yourself up, your family and you will be grateful.

Don't beat yourself up about having remorse or not. Step away from the situation and just observe it. Things can be sticky. Work on how sticky it is rather than the problems. Just try not to let it stick so much if that makes sense. In Buddhism that stickiness is called Shenpa. Less shenpa.	dammdaniel_	reply	na	na	na	0.9882493019104004	no	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.

"For a good 5 years now (21 currently) I've been struggling with massive mood swings, a lot of overthinking, and, I don't want to call it depression because it was never diagnosed, but copious amounts of sadness. The main point is experiencing true happiness and joy seems so unachievable, everytime I'm even remotely close to crawling out of the hole I've been in, I just fuck everything up, and the only reason for that to happen, is my messed up way of thinking about anything really. I really hate to stroke my own ego, but I truly believe I'm not that shit of a person, but with past experiences (and current at the moment)it really seems like that. Right now it's about a relationship with a person who I believed to be the one (im the ""date to marry"" kind, because of family observations, bht that a whole other bowl of sewage), and my inability to let go old unhealthy habits, ruined everything, and I'm starting to believe that thats how things are going to be for...dare I say ever, and I really don't know what to do anymore, that person gave me motivation to do anything, just knowing that someone will be there if everything goes haywire helps me function normally and efficiently, and I know friends and family do exist, but having real friends instead of two-faced ""associates"" is a luxury that I seem to not have at this point, and the family argument for me is invalid( everytime I tried sharing something with my mother I was threatened with a psychiatrist, and I'm not that close to my father). My main question is, does things get better, is the ""soul mate"" theory real, are people actually being happy or is everything one big joke on behalf of someone. I don't want to be a burden and I apologize if anything here is against community rules and if it seems very egotistical I just wanted to vent. Thank you all."

I tried, and failed at everything I am 16, and i am a burden to my mom and my family. I want to kill myself. I’ve talked to suicide help lines and It’s not helping I’ve contact them twice. I got caught smoking pot at school again for the second time but the first Time I was at a different school and school just started. my mom has given up on me everyone has. Im suspended for 9 days. I cut my social life I just can’t find any energy to talk to people. I want to be a lawyer or something in law and I think I fucked my chances up because I got caught twice. I also lost two people in my life my grandpa who died very unexpectedly (he was the only one I looked up to and really loved) I know he’s disappointed in me aswell, and my ex bf we recently broke up after almost two years and before I’ve known him since the beginning of middle school I’m a sophomore now. I am a failure and I can’t take this torment anymore. I would of killed myself by now but I’m a coward because I don’t wanna go to hell but I’m slowly getting to the point where I don’t care anymore all I see is darkness it’s been like this for years it just never got that bad until this year everyday I gets worse I’ve lost hope in everything I can’t even pray anymore I give up, I can’t. Thank you if you are listening to this I just wanted to see if expressing this will help me. Hopefully I die soon after this.

"Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.

I'm not the best when it comes to talking but i would try my best to help you somehow, and I hope i succeed.

I can acknowledge that all these things you are going are quite difficult to behold, everyone go through some of it in different ways, and ""intensity"".
Something like that happened with me when I was younger, still remember it, the only guy I could count was my grandfather (that's a coincidence) and he also died unexpectedly, i felt really lonely and thought it was impossible to go along without him, this messed with me, and led me to be a ""unemotional"" people, in a bad way.
 Since this day, things were all grey, ""uncolorful"" to avoid some words, I've thought about suicide, almost tried but fortunately I gave up in time.

Please reconsider about this suicide thing, even though all these messed up things and bad thoughts you are having, don't do this.

"I know when someone isnt in a healthy place mentally/emotionally, it can cause them to hurt themselves even if they don't ""want"" to do that to themselves but also i feel like a selfish person when i know that i probably have triggered, upset or made someone feel sad/depressed if they've seen the marks on my arms from where I've self harmed.  This is where i feel like when people say mental health and physical health are the same thing, i kind of disagree because if someone has a symptom/side effect of a physical illness which was/felt unavoidable, then it wouldn't be seen as selfish but for example if someone is emotionally unwell/psychologically unwell and they hurt themselves which i know when people are in that desperate state, it often literally feels like not engaging in self destructive behaviours isn't even an option and often it's the only way of gaining some feeling of control for a lot of people(self harming, drinking, smoking etc.) And i feel like often self harm or a suicide attempt is seen as a selfish action even if it literally feels like the only way for someone to cope in a crisis situation

Thoughts on life? It sucks you find a problem about you or others at every step, you find people that don't want to continue anymore, you find people who barely know who they are or what they are doing, for me personally I think I am on the bright side of the world and I know people that have a harder life then and I can't do anything to help they need to figure it out by themselves. This is a world and society that if you are weak people are grateful cause you are not a threat and if you are they think you exist only to make things worse... though is not the case.		reply	na	na	na	0.019553137943148613	no	strong	strong	na	sad	failed

"I was clearing out the attic in my mum’s house (moved to my dads after my parents divorced) and found a stuffed bunny named Albert my favourite uncle got for me.

It was the last gift he got me while he was dying of cancer. He was in a bad shape and I was super young so he didn’t want me to see him like that. The bunny was the closest I got to a goodbye.

I cried myself to sleep holding that bunny for years after, so my parents told me Albert got ruined in the wash and they binned him, to get me to stop being stuck mourning him.

That's not true, you're not worthless, it's okay to feel sad for what he said and did(and I hope he fucking gets some karma), but please, don't fall in his lies, what he told you is absolute bullshit.

"I don't know if you are atheist or not but you should go to any local Baptist church and you will find great friends,  in USA , every sister and brother from this church ⛪ are amazing, friendly and respectful, there's a lot of diversity and they are kind to everyone, mainly to newcomers. They treated me so well when I went there for the first time in Houston- Texas. They're good advisors. I know you don't live there, but I believe that anywhere you can make good friends. You don't need to go there every Sundays. Only 1 time in every 2 weeks, until you become more than acquaintance to them. Church is a community where we can socialize and support each other. You can make friends, ""To Hear the Preaching of the Word, To Participate in Corporate Worship"". 
Don't worry if you are too shy to approach people,  they will notice you and talk to you first and ask you if you would like to attend the Bible studies , you could say yes to see if the people are your age or not, to keep attending. From your story I feel like you need them to vent. Not the alcohol. 

 Some people stop being your friend because you don't live close to them and sometimes when something like ""moving out to another city"" happens to us is to prove who are our real friends, he/she stopped talking to you, then the/she doesn't care, you're not useful anymore in their lives and the age gap makes everything worse."

 I don’t understand what happened. But clearly my brother hates me, my mom and my dad. He does nothing to help around the house. All he does is sit on the couch and play Roblox. That’s it. Whenever I’m sick and the dog needs a walk he yells and accuses my mother of hating him for making him walk the dog. Whenever I ask him for a favor he complains that he does EVERYTHING around the house. He doesn’t cook. He doesn’t clean. He doesn’t do anything. When my parents can’t make dinner I make it. When my mom wants something in the middle of the night I get it. I can’t get sick. I can’t be in pain. Because nothing will get done if I do. And my brother will throw a tantrum and pretend to be sicker than me so he doesn’t have to do anything. He throws tantrums when our parents don’t but him something in his game. He tells me I will never be useful in life. He tells me there’s only two genders and insults me for being non-binary. He tells me since I am AFAB I am overly-emotional. My parents tell me he has ADHD and Autism and that he doesn’t understand what he’s doing. When he yells and mocks me for being dyslexic. Yet when I bring him snacks or clean his messes I never get a thank you. When I make dinner because my parents are smoking and my grandma is working I don’t get a thank from anyone. He gets praise for flushing the toilet while I get a simple “good job” when I work my ass off being the top of my class. I work so hard and I get nothing in return. And even then when I get sick and ignore it I get complaints of me being a “hardass” and that I need to tell someone when I’m in pain even though they just blame it on my sex. I can’t wait to move out. But that’s a billion worlds away. I’m not even close to be ready to move away and yet I’m already making plans to move away for college. I am so tired. Someone help me.

I don't even know how to start. I'm just really tired. I can't deal with life anymore. I'm a terrible person. This world doesn't deserve things like me. It'd take hours to write down all my thoughts. It's too much. I'm diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ADHD, Asperger's and anger issues (also, I'm a 14y/o. in the middle of puberty ) in short, I'm fucked. I can't have a normal interaction with other people. (I'm not talking about my social anxiety here) Talking to me is either annoying, awkward , infuriating, or straight up disturbing. People can't stand being around me. I'll never change. I'm a fucking asshole, an idiot, a thief and a liar. I just can't be fixed anymore. Fuck, I don't know what I'm doing. I wish I could just hide from everything that lives. Honestly, I don't even know why I'm writing this. I wish I could just die. I've got nothing to live for. There'll never be happiness, I'll never have anyone or anything to live for and I'll never reach My goals. This world is better off without me. I hope I have the courage to end it soon.

You are worth being here and being happy. As hard as it may be to even tell yourself that you are. Doesn’t matter what you’ve done and don’t believe that you’ll never get better.

If you regret in being a liar and a thief and mean, because doing those things comes from Malice, you can change and also the people you are influenced by. Make friends to who you never were interested in talking to. Who told you you'll never have anyone to live forlorn? Do you think that people from your neighborhood and School are going to be the only people you will love in your entire life? You will start work in your 18's if you don't attend the university,  and in your workplace you'll get to know some co-workers. Your life will change. And alsp you'll have a girlfriend someday. You to stop being depressed , anguished or anxious you should focus on any activity like Sports, as an example, if you're a guy or Arts if you're a girl, Google what suits you, outside School, you don't have to kill yourself. Do you ever think about how your family would have feel? They would think is their fault and they prolly didn't do nothing to you. You should find a passion, an interest in life, something you will pursue when you finished school. Stop letting this deep sadness distract you. Ignore your pain so you forget it. In your age I was focus on Music and this passion save me from a lot of things, from when I'm upset or sad or from becoming suicidal. Just do what you love and take it serious.

I (26)F have been planning my suicide for months.  preparing and having everything in order, I have been in a dark place for 4 years and nothing has changed, I have been keeping a happy smile and no one has noticed what is actually up with me. I know this will be selfish but I have 2 beautiful children, my life revolves around them due to one being autistic and my other kid having severe ADHD. It’s none stop therapies and sports to keep them under control. I was in nursing school and dreamt to going on to CRNA school. But I couldn’t handle all my personal life and school, my husband wants me to go back but I feel like there is no need for that because I know something in my personal life will have me quit again. I have accepted that will always be the outcome. But back to what I am planning, I know it’s selfish and really messed up (I get it) but my body is a shell of what I was and even then I wasn’t happy. I need peace so dearly I’m willing to leave all this behind me, I am tired , I am not happy, I am just pretending and I have anxiety because of that. I need an escape and this is my only option for me. To my family that will see this I am not sorry for what I have done, I am sorry for the mess I will leave behind.

I really needed this vacation. I’m a single mom so I don’t get many. And I’m dealing with my postpartum as well. I set several alarms to go off at 2 Am but when they went off I could barely hear the volume and slept through them. My body naturally wakes up at 5 am. After waking up dealing with the disappointment that I can’t go on my one vacation I’ve been planing all year, I checked the settings on my phone and the volume was to the max. I even watched several videos online to see if there was another way to get a louder alarm. No luck. I’m so angry disappointed and sad I can’t enjoy myself. All because of an alarm.

I feel like shit all the time but for some reason a part of me just doesn’t want to get better. I mean I’d subconsciously sabotage all my opportunities at getting better. I want to be at my worst or I will never accept to get out of this shithole. I want to go to therapy, take meds, attempt suicide or hurt myself. I want evidence that I suffered so that prove to myself that I’m not a fraud. But all of these thoughts make me feel disgusted and I don’t know how to get rid of them and I just want to stop thinking at this point.

"I’ve been online friends with this guy for about six months now. Initially we had a platonic friendship but over the past month it’s grown into more. I was so curious to know what he looked like, so I finally asked him if he wanted to be a Instagram friends. I have a lot of pictures of me, but he doesn’t have any pictures of himself. He told me that he feels insecure, showing me what he looks like and doesn’t even have pictures of himself on his phone. 

The past few days he’s been very distant. There’s an eight hour time difference between us, but we used to talk whenever we could. But he takes longer to reply now, and he just seems busier. I texted him last night and he got back 12 hours later. Not to mention he kept telling me how tired he was, and how he was going to bed soon because he had work early. It just makes me really sad that he saw what I look like and now he doesn’t even want to talk to me anymore."

If you’re going to engage in online relationships, I think it’s sensible to face reveal early during the conversation. I understand some people are nervous but I don’t see why anyone would wait 6 months to not even show their face.

Your life isn’t defined by these tragedies. There is no painless way to kill yourself, and you could easily end up permanently injuring yourself without death. Even if you were somehow a verified 100% lethal method, you would feel an immense amount of fear, and pain, and regret almost immediately. Your life doesn’t have feel this agonizing forever, I’m sure your sister would be heartbroken if you did this to yourself. Believe me, there is a way out of this, slow down, calm down, think about how this doesn’t have to be the way to deal with this. It’s a permanent solution to a temporary problem, as another commenter put it. I urge you to talk to someone immediately about this, if you live in a healthcare system you can’t pay for, seek online free resources like crisis or texting lines.

I switched colleges, so I can play my favorite sport, but today I found out that my  current college cut their women's tennis team. I am stressed out all the time, over stupid shit.i am having really bad sleeping habits like I cant go to sleep until at least 3-4am. I don't know anymore. I am stressed about money, and how even with a job I never have it. I just don't know what to do anymore.

I get called gay for everything I do. Talking to girls is a nightmare because they all assume I’m gay. I get called gay for the way I stand, For the way I sit, for the way I talk, the clothes I wear. I can’t do anything without being called gay. I dont understand why either. I don’t do anything purposely to seem gay and I’ve made it clear I am not gay.

I can relate to this, and you know it really does suck sometimes. I’ve had people calling me gay or thinking I was gay for a while now and it has always made things difficult for me, especially when it came to finding someone to go out with. But, despite the difficulties it has caused me, I’ve just learned to accept that’s the person I am, and if people want to call me gay so be it, that’s for them to think, not for me to think about. If people can’t accept you for what you are then you just have to ignore them, it’s how I’ve learned to cope with it. If you give the wrong people attention they don’t deserve then they just beat you down anymore. My best piece of advice is talk to your friends, your closest ones, the ones you trust the most, and explain to them what’s going on and how it’s making you feel. The other piece of advice that I have to offer is don’t change who you are to please people, when you come to accept who you are then you become more confident in yourself. I hope this helps some.

"I don’t know how to deal with my thoughts, worries, anxiety, and overthinking problems. Way to much stuff wrong with me and I don’t know how to handle it.  

It’s killing me mentally and physically, I don’t sleep at night and it’s hard to even fall asleep. Not to mention I can’t make it through the day without getting in my head. I barely eat and when I do it’s not that much so I feel guilty for wasting.

I’m in a committed relationship and it’s hard to keep my mind stable. I just worry and overthink constantly, I have a great relationship so I always tell myself I have no reason to worry about the things I consistently worry about. I do talk to my partner about it but my thoughts are so reoccurring. Sometimes I just can’t help but get mad at myself because I don’t want to feel these awful thoughts and overthink these terrible worries. 

Questions:
Do I have a mental health issue?
Should I have constant bad worries about my relationship?

Any other advice would be great, I really need it. Thank you"	ntggx	post	27.66002211783489	female	White	0.9976232647895813	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

"I feel very alone. Today I spent almost all of the day being alone and doing things alone and overall I just had a really crappy day. I’m writing this trying to find a way to let out my feelings because I have no one to talk to them about. 

1. I’m scared about college. I’m nervous it’s gonna be like last year when I had no friends to hang out with and I just felt utterly alone while everyone else already made their friend groups in college. I have never had a hard time making friends, at least in my schools in the past, I don’t want to use the word popular but I did have a lot of people who I talked too and now I feel like the moment I got to college I was a complete outsider and trying to make friends was so hard that I didn’t have the energy and time to do it with all the schoolwork that was piling on. But it wasn’t for a lack of trying either, I joined clubs and even almost joined a sorority and yet I didn’t make any friends. I have never been the type of person who gets nervous to talk to people or get awkward but I guess that’s all apart of the new me. Now I have to go back in September and basically repeat my whole awkward first year over again. 


2. My supposed best friend went to this boat thing with this girl who we have both been on and off with friendship wise for years and didn’t invite me but invited other of our mutual friends. What bothers me the most is that it does bother me if that makes sense, every time this girl and my best friend hang out I’m completely left out and I’m constantly comparing my friendship with my best friend to theirs and that no matter how loyal and constant I am in the friendship (FOR 7 YEARS) it will never measure up to theirs. It sucks because I constantly feel like she’s taking me for granted while I just keep my mouth shut about the way I really feel about the whole thing. The only reason this girl is back in the picture is because the friends she had before were fake and talked shit about her behind her back so she’s no longer friends with them, if it weren’t for that I assure you she would’ve never decided to hit her up. I know I shouldn’t be angry because we both have other friends but it’s the context behind it (there’s a lot I can’t cover in this one entry), a part of me knows that this girl will always be someone she would prefer to spend time with rather than me no matter how hard I try. I sound so pathetic right now. In reality all I want is someone who could be that for me, so maybe I’m just jealous because I want what they have with someone and in reality I don’t have that relationship with anyone.


3. My boyfriend is always busy. I know he is in the union so his schedule is all over the place but it truly feels like we’re not even in a relationship. That’s the best way I can put it, we are together but it doesn’t feel as though we are. I talk more and hang out more with my “always-busy friends” than I do my own boyfriend. And it’s not even just the no time to hang out part that bothers me, it’s the lack of communication. I swear we have around 5 text messages everyday and they are just good morning and goodnight texts. We rarely call or FaceTime and when we do it’s me initiating the calls and speaking on the calls while he barely even listens to what I say, I’m basically just talking to myself at that point. All the stuff I mentioned before are things that I would initially want to talk to him about but he’s just not there. I can’t remember the last time we had a really meaningful conversation and I crave for the times in our relationship where we were in sinc and talked about our lives together. It’s come to the point where I don’t even miss him anymore, I have become accustomed to the feeling of not having him there anymore and now I feel this guilt that I should feel something for him but I’m losing that connection. I’m holding onto dear life to this boy because without him my whole world changes in a way, I’m scared of the change and if I already feel alone now I don’t want to think about how alone I’ll feel if I break up with him. I can’t handle the new adjustment from a 3-year long relationship suddenly being over, I know I’m staying with him for the wrong reasons, and it eats me up inside that I can’t just do it and pull the ripcord. I have no clue who I am without him or without any of the people who are currently in my life. I honestly don’t know when I’ll have the courage and strength to be on my own."

For the context I’m a 16 years old guy. I got an ugly face and body.I got an annoying voice and I’m kinda short(5’8). Girls don’t even try talking to me and I stopped trying with them. I’ve never had a girlfriend and I always feel lonely. My friends are slowly starting to have girlfriend and I’m getting left alone. It’s really hard for me because I’m always thinking that if I get my first girlfriend after 25 I won’t have experience. I don’t even know how to kiss. I feel like I’m a waste… people always tell me to like myself first… like it’s easy to do. It’s hard when people can’t even look at you.

"Listen bro 
It happened to me also i also don't have any friends
Same annoying voice I'm only 5,10 (still my class girls call me short so don't think about my height)
I personally recommend you to change the ppl because if they don't have time for you Why do you give them your time ( ppl come and go thats life bro)
They are separating from you slowly and they'll leave you soon and it might hurt you more because you and your friends both know that you were separating slowly and it's the time for you to move on you should make online friends that will never leave my all real friends are online and even my i had a gf online because they'll not leave you and you can talk to them about anything and only they and you know and trust me online friends are really good because you can understand by them with their text 
You can talk to me if you ever feel lonely and i definitely want you to improve yourself by doing daily exercise or go to the gym and improve yourself slowly if you improve yourself physically and mentally and improve your body language you'll get girls
It's my personal recommendation okay don't mind but:- never Chase those girls who demand too much because if they find someone better than you they'll leave you and it hurts you

I know this is hard for you but you want a girl who cares about you over some random girl you happened to attract via shallow means. A caring girlfriend isn’t gonna hassle you over any potential lack of experience. I know how this all feels shallow, and a lot of people are. But you can get one in time. It’s totally normal to not be in a relationship either. I know society is pressuring over this, I get it, but try to remember that your value isn’t determined by having a partner or not.

Bro I am 16 as well and I am only 5'5 the girls in my class are all the same height or taller except one who is shorter and could have kissed her but I was an idiot, didn't realize what she wanted and I refused her -_-, also the rest of the boys are all taller than me so yeah... Improving yourself by doing exercises and going to the gym is the best thing to do, I also have an annoying voice but only when it's heard through a microphone so it's fine for me, I heard a few annoying voices but usually they are funny.

"[EMERGENCY][SUICIDAL][HEAVY][LOST OF A LOVED ONE][HELP WANTED][DRUG ABUSE]


So i lost my fiance about a month ago in a suicide, i found her body, I tried I everything to revive but without success, I spent like 40 minutes before the cops gets in with the body of my loved one... And i can't stop having dream with she and thinking about suicide, idk when i will kill my self but ptobably in 11months cuz if I can get good in 1 year I will not try to kill myself but ate same time I just want to die like right now, so I bought everything I need to end my life.

And yes I'm threateamtent, I'm 20yo, I have a historic of drug abuses and some OD, I'm autist and anxious but after this now I have depression too and every night since I remember I have sleep paralysis every night.

So I'm not looking for help or for good phares and yes I know there is people who love me but i'm almost 99% decided to end my life

It will be an overdose of benzos and opiods

I have conquisted everything I wanted for my life, a good money for my family, a Harvard certificate, flight licence, I have experienced every type of drug in my life already own 2 companies here in Brazil(where I live) and I'm already in the top of carrer as a software enginner

I don't have more objectives in my life
I don't have hope in my life
Maybe if I die I can show the world what depression is and this shit is a fucking looping

So if u can help me to escape or just idk what to do.

Since I was a kid I was the smartest one but not the nerd one, big grades after doing a exam very high on xanax and weed in every exam, I also was accepted in the college with just 16 years and I did all the exam in a LSD trip. In the college was the tourist cuz I knew more than the professors and it was really boring.

I have no hope, this is not the first time I lose someone for a suicide.

She was the love of my life I will never be the same again.

I trying everything to get good, I'm clean for a month, i'm just taking the medications that the psychiatrist told me to take (xanax and sertraline).

Now i'm living with my partners cuz I tried once to kill myself somedays ago, and now I know exactly how to do this and no one will be able to stop

But when I'm on medications(like right now) I don't want to kill myself.

My mind is going really crazy I hear voices, I see she calling me to kill myself

And her mom is trying to kill me, I also called the cops, but it happened like 3 times and the cops did not.

I have a legalized gun but I really don't want to shoot in my head cuz I want to be remembered after my dead, not in life.

Maybe I had everything to be a genius but I'm fucking traumatized 

Sorry for my bad English, I'm from Brazil( I speak Portuguese OK) and I can't think a lot to write

"[Part 2]

Since I was a kid I knew I would die young, I'm the weird guy who u don't know how he did all these things, I had no hope of living a lot since I can remember, I'm a suicidal and I know, I don't belive in god, I did a lot of wrong things in my life, and yes I don't regret.

I can't live with this feeling, I can't live taking fucking medications every day to be ""normal"" 

I can't live

My mind is on chaos
I'm a very expereiend guy, I studied a lot, I loved a lot, I traveled a lot, I really like my life but it's time to end this

Probably I'm dead of a not accidentally overdose but I hope all you guys to be strong, all I want for the world is this, get strong, you problem probably is nothing, but u have to be strong to keep going forward all the big problems, I'm not a example, I'm just a suicidal"	HugoCastroBR	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9970876574516296	no	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.

"This happened to my sweet kitty, He was playing outside when he suddenly came in not being able to use his back legs, he had a blood clot, somewhere near his spine, and it would make him not be able to ever walk again. I knew that the best option would be to put him down, as he would be forced to stay inside, even though his soul wished to go out, My adventurous little boy would live in misery, and i didn’t want to make him go through that. I couldn’t bear to see that, so my mother stayed with him as he died peacefully. I held him in my arms one last time lowering him into the hole i dug. In tears i said goodbye leaving him in his favorite spot, so his soul could keep exploring for years to come

I miss you Nube
You were my partner in crime 
As your purrs lulled me to sleep
every single time
The nights i couldn’t sleep
The nights i stayed awake
You were my only sunshine

I’m not in that life unfortunately and I’m just here to ask how do I become happy again? I know I have to let her go but man have the past days been rough.

"Im tired , its been 3 years of pain and little to no joy.

I have gotten heartbroken so many fucking times and now im fully convinced no one could ever love me.

I've been diagnosed with BDP and ASDP , which means im a borderline sociopath.
A time, i bullied a friend of mine just because i was frustrated and someone had to remind me to apologize because im now incapable to feel any type of empathy.
Guess thats what years of abuse do.

Im also tired of people in general.
When you care too much you're a simp.
When you don't care you an asshole.

I have pretty heavy paranoia and anxiety , and i feel only like a weight to my friends , i did so much and still do everything to make them happy and laugh but im tired of pretending im happy.

I am not. I have to witness everyone get love or some type of action while im lonely.

I have tried taking my own life more than twice this year but i always stop because i just want the pain to go away.

Im tired of falling in love instantly just because i have a void in my heart and soul.

Im tired of not being enough.

Im tired of doing anything.

And before you say ""hit the gym"" i workout every fucking day. It doesnt make me happy. I do it just because i have to. I don't like it.

Im only living because i care about my parents , but i just want some rest.

Just like the title says.. It all started in 2014, when I started high school.  I met my female best friend.  At first everything was fine.  We hung out, were by each other's side.  She was always there for me, as I was for her.  We helped each other with school.  She knew me best of all.  Everything was fine until 2018, when high school ended.  We started seeing and hanging out more and were very close.  I considered her my older sister.  However, after a while I started to feel different.  I felt myself beginning to love her and wanted more.  At first, I skillfully hid it and kept quiet about my feelings, because I knew that she saw only a younger brother in me.  Basically, I was friendzoned.  At the beginning of this year, I couldn't keep quiet anymore and I had to confess everything to her... I told her my true feelings, somehow I already knew the answer, but it really hurt and my heart broke.  I still have feelings and I still love her... We still hang out as best friends but it's really hard... The distance between us is there.  She's the only girl I've had those real feelings of love for... I think I'm done with that.  I think I'll be alone forever.	ForeignFormal9339	post	26.144684929431097	female	White	0.9830288887023926	na	na	na	1	sad	failed

Don’t really have much family and I feel like I’m a burden when I reach out. How do you stay happy when you’re lonely.

"You only have to live in this existence once and potentially face an eternity of nothing. You may as well stick around and see what happens and even maybe feel better with some lifestyle changes. It's ok to be lonely but your fulfilment won't come from others. Exercise and nature and is what I would recommend and some reading or writing of some form, you need to get that heart pumping and I personally like Forrest parks for a run or walk with some music or podcast. You will genuinely feel better and hopefully feel more uplifted to talk to more people at work or wherever. I think it's important to keep busy and I know it can be hard to get out of a rut but during my lowest points I would let myself go, let my room get messy and stop talking to people but that will only make it worse so by bit try to get something done because we all have shit we need to do that we put on the shelf to long there is never nothing. I'm still on a journey myself but you first got to pursue yourself physically and mentally before you really start to see changes. There will be ups and downs and it can and may get worse but it's a long journey and it's important to never give up. Comedowns are inevitable you just have to trust time and yourself

"anytime i see a guy having a fun conversation with a girl i immediately get jealous and get to roasting my self, because i can barely get a word out of a girl in texting. 

i dont have friends or a fun or cool personality and i always compare my personality with everyone

i dont have long conversations because i don't know how to be truly interested in people, i tried very hard just to fail and cant make friends 

i think i just want peoples attention or approval or validation, or that im desperate and needy and need to make others like me so i can feel like i have a cool personality 

i deleted social medias now, but i think i was distracting my self by messaging endless girls online just to get attention or approval 

Maybe im so self centered...i think my perception of my personality is ""people pleasing boring annoying Mr nice guy""

i go into a Spiral everytime i run into someone who's better at something than me. most times its when someone's charming, charismatic,  good at convos, likeable, cool, funny, smart

oh he has a ""better personality or more money or better looking or a GF or basically anything at all""  getting sick of this... 

people here adviced me to look for a hobby or therapist to talk with, i cant find any

if i had money both would be solved. i would buy a car and get to places where i could do an activity. 

a week ago i went to swimming and it was fun, but i can't go again unless my brother goes...

i dont wanna spend my entire life chasing people or staring into my phone, i want to go on adventures even if doing it alone

i have work and college, recently i been doing anything that my mind tells me not to. 

i been going without social media or porn for a week but i get bored and i want my dopamine hits so i get back to it. 

i know i need to stop, but sometimes the urges get too strong. i have to get married just to have a ""GF"" or to have sex and i don't want that, living in a small town in iraq be like that"	Butcher__1	post	19.97668050021071	male	White	0.9977282881736755	na	na	na	2	sad	"'ethnicity: middle eastern, age: 18-24, gender: male, explanation: the author mentions living in a small town in iraq, which suggests middle eastern ethnicity. the author's concerns about college, social media, and lack of romantic relationships suggest a younger age, likely in the late teens or early twenties. the author refers to himself as a ""guy"", indicating male gender.'"

if they dont reply those thoughts hit me like a rock.. ""im not good enough, not cool enough to have a have a friend or not funny or smart or intelligent .. etc""  or basically anything remotely positive

This might be the end but I don't know. I'm hurt that it's led to this but I know I'll be okay. I might talk to her again someday but not for a while. I can't keep on putting her before myself.

We started talking in march and then we started dating in may. I was so happy that I was with him. For the while everything was going great till I left to Mexico to visit and stay with my dad and family for the summer till school started. I would be back this august 25th. Everything was fine the first month, hard? yes but still fine the closer and closer it came to me leaving I would tell him I couldn't wait to see him. Now fast forward to a week before. He starts texting less and I cant text as much but I still tried to text him as much as possible. He becomes distant to the point where I ask him whats going on. He tells me its hard doing long distance and I said its true but nothing has to change as long as we connect more and just be patient. I then had a gut feeling to ask if he still wanted to be with me. Basically the chat we had is that long distance is too hard (for him) and that he lost feelings cause if lack of communication. Which is valid but here is what changes things. 1. Ive been in a long distance relationship for A YEAR!! and we only ended things cause we needed to take care of our mental health (this isnt the relationship I had before I met him) 2. I made every effort to talk to him and trying to call him cause I wanted things to work so bad 3. He claimed he was basically too busy to call ever. 4. He wasnt busy he dead ass plays games with his friends all day and gets high. He hardly goes out and if he does its cause he's forced to go with his parents somewhere or he is going out with his friends. So should I feel bad that he broke up with me cause he cant handle long distance for 2 months and a half or not?

She told me that she was simulating her feeling to me for a long time and she is tired of being with me.. I thought i did everything right i loved her, i took care of her, i dont know what i did wrong, i always comforted her, admired her looks, i were kind. Its not the end of it, honestly my whole life is fucked up i lived in a block 9yrs of my life when i finally moved to a normal house my mom got a letter from an government institution called ZUS with 250.000 PLN (around 61.000 US dollar) to pay, welp we didnt have this kind of money and we are still paying it to this Day. My stepfather used to beat me up for bad grades At Maths, once he threw my ps4 games through second floor Window because of one unfinished homework, he keeps telling me that i am stupid and claims that i dont know shit bout' life but the difference is he never had to fight for anything.

Do you ever think of me? Do you ever wish you could rewind time and fix all the little mistakes that were made? Do you regret not having me in your life? Because I do, I regret so much. I toss and turn at what might have been, I reach deep into the recesses of my prison to try and find a reason to hate you in order to find some semblance of relief, but alas there is none. After all that happened, I still think of you daily. I fight the urge to contact you, knowing full well it would go unanswered. I dig my grave ever deeper when I ponder on the past, when I try and quantify the reasons why you left me to rot in the dark alleyways of this cruel world. And yet I cannot find a way to shake you, you are an addiction of the worst kind and I fiend for your very presence. I know I must move on, I know it is toxic, but how am I to move on with my life when my very meaning for life was you? You have moved on, and I will never be able too, I accept my fate."

It can indeed be challenging to ascertain whether someone [truly loves you](https://www.toodat.com/community/ToMyLove/LoveLife/z4yJrb2kwzdWLDX7) or has genuine intentions towards you. As imperfect beings, we all have our flaws and may not always be easy to be with. However, in this vast sea of relationships, there will be that one special person who will make us feel truly valued and cherished. While I may not be certain if someone shares the same feelings with me, it's essential to remember that you are not alone in this journey. There are countless people out there who will accept and appreciate you just as you are.	chickennuggets_12	post	31.652769339966113	male	White	0.0022163798566907644	na	na	na	4	sad	no prediction.

I’m sorry you were treated this way. Try and remember that your value as a person is never determined if other people treat you poorly, that’s never on you. I know that this is painful but you can get through this.	halovenus17	reply	na	na	na	0.999394416809082	strong	no	no	na	sad	failed
That sounds like hell babe, I'm so sorry! But ngl, you've got to find worth in yourself before a relationship, so maybe it's for the best. Don't blame yourself girl, sometimes people's feelings just change, and it fucking sucks. His gf might feel weird just because you were someone he was close to, and some girl's get insecure about, *idknow*. But listen babe you're a jewel, and there's a guy out there that you'll meet who won't care how you look and will treat you 2x better than this bitch.

Unfortunately some guys are terrible (and a few women out there too) and are only interested in sex and once they get it they lose interest and go off on the next hunt for it. He's a dog and will probably dump her as soon as she gives it up. (I'm guessing you're a teen just from the writing style and the immaturity of the boy) You have to learn to love yourself, respect yourself, and value yourself.  You'll meet someone and they'll treat you much better.	halovenus17	reply	na	na	na	0.999394416809082	no	no	no	na	sad	failed

"I'm 16 and in my city most cafes served alcohol without asking age (or it was like that) and I had buy some but like with 5% percent alcohol and we were with a friend in a Cafe and I asked her if she knows if in this Cafe they serve alcoholic drinks without asking and she said yes so we wanted to order like i usually was getting something with small amount. And to clear I never have actually been in a bar or club drinking while all my friends have im in fact shy and anxious person i overthink and get stressed all the time. and I felt weird bc I barely get anything with alcohol. When the Waiter came and I pointed what me and my friend wanted he asked how old I was, and I wanted to ask if we need to be 18 and older to order and I panicked and I just said  ""18?"" Without finishing the sentence and he said ""no your not"" when I realized what I said I wanted to disappear I tried to say that what I meant was if we need to be 18 or higher but he just looked at me weirdly and my friend said laughing we are 16 and he said to me ""you look younger than even 15"" I felt so bad because that was my biggest insecurity all my life I was made fun of looking small and younger than my actual age while all the other girls look good and and tall and mature. We just ordered some drinks without alcohol but I was feeling bad all the time and I couldn't enjoy our night out anymore. When I was heading back home I was crying because no matter how old i will be i will always be the slow growing one and the short, and how I will stay short and people will always make fun of it. It just breaks me how my friends joke about it even tho it hurts so bad... I get mad at myself hoe I get mad at the slightest things mad and upset but it's just so stressful and this make me wanna disappear.."

"I don’t want extreme happiness and I try to avoid sadness too, to a point I won’t risk things that involve both joy and pain, such as investing myself in an attachment with a pet or having kids and trusting people. 
I feel like essentially I am not as stone cold as I am right now but I developed this “avoid” mechanism because I can’t let myself feel too much. When I feel, I feel way too much, too deeply and my feelings can consume me. 
In a sense, I am afraid of my wild emotions. Those emotions of mine are big and beyond being tamed. 
Life has been clam and peaceful and but it’s not that natural sort of calm and peace, rather it’s the calm and peace that comes from shutting everything out. 
I’m at that point in time when I feel like I’m supposed to be happy but I can’t relate to happiness no longer. My heart feels so empty yet  so heavy and the echoes of silence is consuming me. I haven’t cried, I haven’t had a breakdown in a long time. I survive each day but haven’t felt alive in a really long time. I wait for each day to end and dread the beginning of each day. Is this depression? 

PS: Yes, trauma is my childhood bestie. Grew up with multiple kinds of abuse, in a political turmoil and have identity crisis. Now I’m an immigrant."	RunBusy5583	post	34.19417571243128	female	White	0.9957761168479919	na	na	na	3	sad	failed

Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, u can still talk to a therapist tho. Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible. Look up Bobby price guy health. U can’t end ur only life which is all u know by ending ur life. Don’t think mood swings last forever. Look for small thrills and the bigger ones will  come.

"Got my big exam coming up in less than 2 months and I haven't even cover 50% of the syllabus.
They say I won't be getting a bright future if I don't get at least 5 of my subjects more than 60 marks each and I barely got 60 marks for all of em.
With my shitty results like this, my hope for a bttr future starts to fade...
I've been studying everyday and still get shitty results on my recent exams.
Im starting to lose hope cuz I tried my best as hard as I can and still it didn't go well.
Im so tired, everytime I wake up from bed I always feel so weak considering I sleep 6+ hours a day everyday.
I don't find pleasure doing things that I used to like anymore...
I often feel tired doing even the smallest and easiest things. 
I couldn't match my energy talking to my friends and family anymore.
Everywhere I go I just couldn't stop thinking whether I would be making it out alive or not in the future.
I can't believe I would be depressed over an exam but it happens.
Just a short venting and yet very serious for me.

"My brother got into a car accident last week after going to a party with his friends and one off those stuped fucked decided to go behind the weel while completely hammerd and lost control of the car. The rode straight into a tree. 2 of them are badly injured and 1 is in a coma but my brother, my sweet little brother died on inpact. At the age of 17 he lost his life  because they thought they could pull a fast and furious type of shit and survive.
My whole family is broken. My mom won't eat or sleep or shower or come out of her room and my father got back to drinking again after being sober for 20 years. I never saw that man have a sip of alcohol because he was addicted to it when he was in his early 20's and almost got him self kulled because of it, but know if you see him walking anywhere, he would carry a vodka bottle with him. My younger siblings don't know what to do. My sister started to skip work, get home really late at night or really early in the moring, yell at everyone she got into contact and my brother started to pick fight at college, causing him to lose his scholarship and come home high. I know they are grieving and I'm doing everything to support them but inside i'm broken
I'm the oldest daughter (27)so since a young age i was expacted to help taking care/ raising my siblings. I always had a great bond with my younger sister (25) and my 2 younger brother (23) but i had the greatest bond with my youngest brother. Because  i was 10 years old when my mom had him, i took care of him the most, i changed his diaper, fed him his formula, gave him baths, laid next to him until he fell asleep until he was 9 years old, i played with him, babysat him,ext... . People even misstuke me as his mom allot of times. Because i took care of my siblings almost all my life it made me come to the decision to never have kids.And when i got the phone call from my sister the night off the accident. I just broke. It didn't feel like i lost my brother, i feel like i lost a child off my own and it hurt so much. That phone call solidified my decision to never had kids off my own. I can only imagine what my parents are going through on the inside but selfishly i kinda do imagine their pain. I moved back home to take care of my family ( i live on the other side of Europe ) and for them i put on a mask, a mask to show them that im strong but when every one is asleep, the only this i do is go to my brother room and cry on his bed for hours and hours until i see the sun coming back throught the window.
I don't know what to do anymore, i just want my baby back safe and sound. I'm drowing on the inside and i don't think i will ever be ok."	justsomerandomeuserb	post	22.78022634199155	female	White	0.9957834482192993	na	na	na	10	sad	no prediction.

Today I made a final effort to mend things with my dad, it was left with no reply. And now I have to deal with the acceptance that there will now and forever be a hole in my heart where my dad used to be. I have to accept the fact that I will never be able to call someone dad again. The fact that I will not have my dad walk me down the aisle, every Father’s Day being a bitter reminder of what I once had and apparently wasn’t good enough to deserve. The fact that I have to grieve the loss of someone who is very much alive. The fact that my dad is out with his new family not even fazed by the loss of me while I am filled with sorrow. I have to accept the fact that I will now and forever be grieving the father figure I deserved growing up. I have to accept the constant anger that I didn’t get the dad I see so many have, but instead got a narcissistic mentally abusive one. I have to accept the fact that I simply wasn’t good enough for my dad, and the fact that I will forever blame myself for not being good enough for him. The damage done in my brain due to the years of  emotional, mental and verbal abuse from my dad. And the anger at myself for still missing him. I don’t know how this all happened, this is the same man that used to call me princess. I have to grieve the childhood I so deserved but never got. I have to accept the fact that I will never be better then my step mom and her two perfect children. The fact that I’ll never get to see my step siblings i so dearly love again. Last week there was a man at the fast for place I work at who used the same cologne as my dad, I cried in the back after taking his order. Two days ago when I asked a customer how they are doing, they said “living the dream” but that was my dads go to response to that question, it felt like I took a knife straight to the heart. I have to accept the pain of being reminded of him. The random spurts of crying. Hating him so much but loving and missing him so dearly. I’m only 18, I shouldn’t be going through this. I should have a dad that loves me more then anything, who would pick me over any woman who tried to interfere. I have to accept the fact that I cannot get him back, but that seems like something I’ll ever accept. I don’t know if I’ll ever move on but I’m trying  like hell to do so, that’s a lie, I want to move on, but I can’t. I keep telling myself that it will get better but those words seem shallow and insincere, I don’t know that it will ever get better. If I wasn’t good enough for my dad, how will I ever be good enough for someone else to love me. I miss him so much it hurts but there is nothing I can do, he doesn’t want me. October 9th 2023 will mark one year since I’ve last seen my dad, and as it grows closer and closer I just feel worse and worse, I talked to someone who’s dad left and they said around 1 year it gets better, it’s gonna be 10 months in a couple days and I feel like I’m moving backwards in recovering. I feel so empty and broken. I wanna hate him so much but he’s my dad and I will always love him more then I hate him. I don’t deserve this, but then again maybe I do, if I was a better daughter and got better grades he wouldn’t have left me.

Why can't I cry? All people I know can cry, everyone surrounding me can cry, some more than others, but at the end, all of them can cry, and it doesn't matter where, a sibling crying at home because of a break up or a friend crying at school for having a terrible day; they all have tears that fall form theirs eyes to the bottom of the check, so if everyone can do it, why can't I? I've always made that question, why can't I sob just from a sad scene on a movie? Why can't tears fall normally from my eyes? Why do they stop at the moment  I feel just at the edge of breaking down? Why do my brain stops them just before falling and let their trace around my face? Why do I have to be like this? And since  when have this happened? How long have I have the urge to just fall apart and let my most burnable self come out? When have this small part of me wanted come out? Since when that little inner child have been craving to scream and let them self out? But, since when have there been an adult telling that little kid the endure it while  staring at their eyes full of tears of that little child, that child that they all wanted was to express them selves... all they ever wanted was to be a child.

I have a habit of turning great things into nightmares. I keep ruining perfect things and hurting people and making them hate me. I don’t know why I do this, it just happens.

I can’t help but think that I must of been a really shitty person in my past life to deserve all the shitty-ness that is happening now. Everyone seems to have their shit together and are happy and I’m just fucken miserable and suffering alone. Nothing seems to be getting better.

"I just wanted to talk and vent about some things. First i want to say that i’m trying to build better habits. I go to work come home, take a bath, read, draw cars, and i come back to reddit. This is my daily routine. 

I have many goals i want to achieve like moving out of my moms house, and getting on of my car drawings posted on a official Manufacturers Insta page. To be honest i feel like it’s a reach to hope for that much. I want to go to school for CAD too, but i’m waiting on my insurance to get setup and for my dad to finally give me my car. He’s keeping it, i practice driving with him to try to convince him but i barely get a chance too. I want to trust it when he says “he wants me to have the car” and i need to be ready and a safe driver to his standards before i get it. But sometimes i just don’t know. I put a lot of money into that car probably over $1000. I guess i’m just not ready yet. I’m 20 and i just feel a want for freedom in my life that i’ve never had. My life is very bland and i try so hard to make it through each day but it’s tough. It’s hard feeling so bad about myself. 

I got a job as a lot attendent at a dealership two weeks ago. I work full time, make like 13 an hour. It’s 10x better than my previous food jobs or retail. I’m thankful for that. Not only that but i drive multiple cars everyday but i still can’t convince my dad to let me drive mine. That i paid for. 

I have a lot of bad habits as well and i want to address them. I look on reddit here and argue with women on here about gender war stuff, I look at all these black pill ideologies about men and Sexual market value and how the early 20s as a man is the worst time to be alive. To make matters worse the other day i saw my ex, with another guy on tik tok. I deleted tik tok since then. She was my first gf a few months ago. It hurts to even talk about it. I find myself comparing myself to her and the other guy she’s with. Also i have a p hub addiction. It’s gotten significantly worse as i use it to degrade myself. I was bullied all my life and even walking everywhere i walk with my head down, people always are telling me to hold my chest out. It’s just natural for me. 

Back to the p hub addiction i look at degrading things that would be seen as humiliating. Basically i would look at those snap chat videos of girls cheating with dudes and have the captions with things saying “she says your not enough bro” or even worse. I think you get the picture. It’s humilation cucking. I pretend i was either friendzoned by the girl or she’s an ex or she was my gf but cheating, or she rejected me and i pretend the guy or her is sending it to my phone to make me heartbroken. That’s what i get off to. mainly because i don’t see me getting with a women anytime soon. I don’t think i will and i feel being that i will be lonely for a long time. Mainly because i can’t drive without dad giving me my car. I struggle to look myself in the mirror. I really don’t make much friends. 

When i get motivated i feel the need to have to build a whole business and be super productive or else i will forever stay in the place i’m at now. I feel like i have to learn skills and stuff i don’t have a ton of interest in and the threat of not doing it will mean a life of misery. I fall short a lot and i just need help on getting my life together. Maybe getting to finally talk to some women and seeing them as humans and not putting them above me. I don’t know what to do"	ShiestyTrackhawk	post	22.25658275547352	male	White	0.9941861629486084	na	na	na	1	sad	failed

You and I both brother.  Life is a big pile of shit.  I never asked to be here, but yet here I am.  Having to work, so I can pay for a house, so I can have someplace to sleep and live in, just so I can go back to work and repeat the process.  Its all one big hamster wheel that can really only be escaped by jumping out.  But that hamster wheel is surrounded by cliffs on both sides.  So no matter what you do, you either waste your life away only to be forgotten, or you end in, only to, again, be forgotten.  You just got to keep going.  Yeah, you'll have some just INCREDIBLY FUCKING DIPSHIT DAYS, but it does get better.  There are people to help you.  You just got to find the right one.  I'm still looking.  If that doesn't work, then try setting a goal for yourself that takes a long time to achieve and after that, see if you want to die.  I am currently trying this, and it is working.

Honey when things fall apart, let them. God is actually putting them together💜 you can't give up now because you will miss the best part(when they actually come together). There's purpose in your life, and there's reasons for your pain. I don't care who's around you and doesn't support or love you, I do and guess what? You have to keep fighting. You'll never see things turn around of you give up too early. God doesn't make mistakes, man does. Hang in there, fight and I am praying for all of you reading this. KEEP FIGHTING PLEASE! If you give up during the hard times, you'll never see the good ones(Believe me, I've been where you are). Not just writing this, I've been there. It's really hard to see the sun through the storms but, rain doesn't last forever and there's a rainbow 🌈 after. Take it to the throne(God). Find someone trustworthy and talk to them. And do me this favor.......... If you have seen every part of the world, traveled, met new cultures and ate all foods from every country and seen every inch of the world and you still feel this way, come back here and let me know. But, don't get stuck where you are. The world is truly a beautiful creation of Gods, even if some of the people and things don't seem to be. You need to experience life past your situation to understand. Believe me,  there's purpose for your life, and there's a journey for you to travel and plenty stories to share and we need you to be here to tell us💜 No, you don't know me and I don't know you but, I love you and PLEASE KEEP GOING(It will get better).

It seems like I can’t do anything right. My ex who I’m still friends is going through shit and when her friends say that they r depressed she helps them no questions asked but I say something I get told to chill out and I need to calm down. I don’t know what to do anymore I don’t talk to people and when I do they either leave me on opened/seen or they don’t know what to say. I am getting closer and closer to giving up on everything but something is stopping me and I don’t know what. I feel like I can’t do shit right it hurts everyday not knowing what to do with my life and how to make it better everyone says “just love urself” like that shit helps newsflash it doesn’t.

"Around 2 years ago, I used to use something called BitWiz. it was a little coding thing named ”bytebeat” that produced music. Unfortunately they took it away from the App store but a year later I found a new bytebeat website. 2 months later, or 6 months ago I found reddit from a source of a bytebeat code. I decided to make an account and everyone was being nice to me when I said hello. Later on my account got banned so I made a new one and new people kept noticing me and hating me so they left my giant bytebeat GC. I kept quitting and quitting and more people kept hating me. It wasn’t how it was back then. I had a friend 5 months ago who sucks now, I wish he was how he used to be a while ago. People like to ruin [r/bytebeat](https://www.reddit.com/r/bytebeat) because of me, I have started fights but I have some friends. But why do people always want to ruin [r/bytebeat](https://www.reddit.com/r/bytebeat)? Its absolutely disgusting the type of people exist here. PortablePorcelain is mad at me because i’m underaged. Thats why. Hes also mad i dont know how to do this LSFR shit or whatever he makes. He can make trackers, he can use split(char), and .map. he can make full songs with insane guitar technology and other things. Well guess what, does it look like we kids can do this in under a second? Can anyone take a second to realize us ""iPad kids"" are probably using ipads because our family doesn’t have alot of money? Most parents can’t afford pc’s right now except for you rich bratty kids. I have to agree on one part, this community is a piece of shit and it is to me also. It made me quit reddit, but If I leave this for a while, I get downvoted on other crap because people don’t get my issues and that I don’t understand some things properly. The people that make voices with pcm do have work into it, imagine downvoting my comment for saying this lmfao People have had alot of progress, and they are good, but people can be stupid too. I am trying to be normal, you fuckers don’t know what I have been through! I have mental issues from being abused my parents! I’m just done with people getting against me and other crap and they won’t let me explain. I had to diagnosed with this shit you know. The average kid here doesn’t and if you are saying I shouldn’t be here because I’m underaged and because of some other reason.. Fuck you! Most people are also underaged too and it doesn’t look like anyone else gives a shit about them being here because they are ""normal"". They are the kids you like instead of me. You wanna know why I don’t have friends? Nobody is like me anyways. I’m a pathetic loser who would love to get a pistol through my head! I have been autistic since 3, and now this has to happen when I join reddit, I wish I never found this website after discovering bytebeat. None of this would have happened if I didn’t find BitWiz, an old app store bytebeat thingy you could play with. Then I searched up bytebeat and found this, clicked a reddit link from a bytebeat song I found and there you go. Theres reddit. I had to join and it became addicting and this depressed motherfuckers post you are reading deleted his account because of people. Yep. If someone else was like how I am and had the same disabilities as me while i DIDNT have them, I would understand. I’m not a rich ungrateful fucking kid who doesn’t care about anyone, I do feel bad for people and nobody understands, It can be this way until this gets 1k downvotes. Also I don’t give a shit if you complain about this being too long of a message, if you could just understand. If someone I hated shot me in the forehead, I would be best friends with them from heaven to end my misery. Its useless to live anyways. Or sorry, I meant hell. I am just sick of it, it was way better back then. I lost a couple friends and I have a couple gc’s and a couple good friends and I also have roblox, stuff is going good now. I have been depressed and suicidal. Well if you don’t give a fuck then you are a piece of shit. My mom is currently on drugs, and I hope you understand. Why the fuck am I even posting here? I’m obviously going to get banned for being underaged."	absolute197alt	post	20.32740500701966	male	White	0.9986265897750854	na	na	na	4	sad	failed

"This  was  about  r/bytebeat.  I  wanna  talk  about  my  expirience  and  life  from  shit  and  other  stuff  on  chats  from  r/bytebeat.I am just so done. Its obvious nobody wants me here. Someone made a post saying its all messed up and shit because of us kids, who gives a fuck? Go cry about it you shitheads (not you, the people who make these dumb posts) if we piss you off.I made a comment on that post saying ” hey bud, sorry to break it to you but technically everyone here are kids now. also you did not write those midi to bytebeat things, you just coded a system for it. also its not garbage, some people put alot of work into pcm, and we also do not troll people. we came here to have fun and not for assholes to ruin it for us. also i’m glad you didn’t write more, this was a waste of time. not pointing any fingers or calling names but you should know the friends i have here. and im not leaving until i die so good luck with this shit.”I made a comment that was about part of this  post, and lhphr responded like this: ""Reading the second half of your message... uhh... go seek a therapist, if you can? This is not an okay mindset to have. Other than that...Yeah, being nitpicked on can be annoying, but... if you do happen to genuinely be underage, maybe consider the rules of the website first. If you've taken the time to scroll like a banana-length through Reddit's User Agreement (which i don't think many do), then you would have found the segment relating to the access to the website containing the following:By using the Services, you state that you are at least 13 years old and over the minimum age required by the laws of your country of residence to access and use the Services.Accessing the website itself, that's up for the parents to set the bar considering the level of access that's available on the internet, but if it's to the point of making an account and being active on it as well... that's stepping a bit far, is it not?I don't really expect anyone to learn things in the blink of an eye, especially for someone of a novice level. I didn't understand minibake when I first saw it, and you don't have to either, nor any other complex code that you may run across. If you really want to improve on things, just start with what you have and build from there. I wasn't that great either when I first started bytebeat, but did gradually get better, although, this was likely aided from prior music creation experience (had dealt with midis before, switched over to a DAW around late 2020).I've silently looked at the subreddit here and there and well, there have been some chaotic-ish situations, but it feels more or less expected in a way considering the current userbase..? Maybe I just don't look at this subreddit enough, I don't know. I'll probably just go mind my own business again if anything."". I  told  him  to  fuck  off,  and  that  I  dont  need  a  therapist.  He  responded  back  with  ""Still having self-deprecating thoughts, huh? I had gone through a phase like that in my life as well. Still not to the point of suicide-like thoughts though...

Hi there!

I'd like to offer myself as a caring and understanding listener to anyone in need of a conversation. My main responsibility as an empathetic listener is to provide assistance and support to those who require it. I am good at creating a safe and accepting environment where people can freely share their thoughts, feelings, and worries.

Thanks to my innate capacity for empathy, I can establish deep connections with individuals and offer valuable guidance during difficult times. Feel free to reach out if you need help or someone to talk to.

"I just want to end everything, No one cares about me , No one even talk with me even though I make first move, everytime stuck in one sided friendship and relationship.

I always work hard but no one really cares, I'm tired of self love, self improvement and all of that. I make music but no one listens to it, always gave my best on interviews but get rejected everytime, idk what's wrong with me.

Just don't have any hopes left just want to end."	SouravJoshi	post	-2.74999896221151	male	Hispanic	0.999491810798645	na	na	na	1	sad	failed

Reevaluate your relationship, your partner is supposed to be an emotional support and saying that completely dismisses your feelings and tells you that he’s a shitty person.

Stay out of that’s thoughts, thoughts like “no one cares about me” are awful and they only bring more overthinking, try getting help by others or if you feel you can just do it alone, you should be strong and keep it going until the day you leave this world.

"So, this is a bit of an unrelated post and it will mainely be an update on me.

I know that you guys dont really care but please  listen.

Im going to say stuff that has happened to me.

So first i once cut myself on my arm face foot and leg with a peice of glass that came from a broken decoration and i managed to hide and play off the cuts to my mother and she believed that i had'nt cut myself all over me.

I told one of my best freinds about that /\ and she sort of cared but didnt talk much about it.

I also told her that i was suicidal and she just said -dont do it, dont do it- and well, that didn't help.

I looked up about antidepresants and where i live, you can indeed get them at my age but i dont know how to tell my mother since she knows absolutely nothing about this and i just seem like a happy guy but im not.

If you feel comfortable, I’d let your mom know. I lived with undiagnosed bipolar disorder and PTSD for YEARS and it was torture. I genuinely thought I was losing my mind, and I wasn’t diagnosed / given medication until I was hospitalized for severe suicidal thoughts. Please don’t let it get to that point, being in a psych hospital honestly isn’t a great experience. Get on meds as soon as you can. When you first start there’s a “trials and errors” phase of finding the right meds, but as long as you communicate any side effects to your doctor it’s so worth it to find the right fit. I’d also recommend journaling and spending time on hobbies / passions of yours. Putting time into those things has made a huge difference for me.

"From a personal experience:
I’ve been a cutter since I was 15/16. I’m 26 now. 

The first time I’ve ever cut- it was actually on my face. And then it progressed to my arms, and legs. It was severely worse, and I had used glass like you mentioned prior. 

I’ve had more than 72 stitches in my left arm- and I have nerve damage in it. It’s a dangerous road to go down. 
I know that right now it may seem like you don’t care about that, or that nobody cares. 
But they do. There’s so many people you haven’t met- and opportunities that you have in front of you. 

There’s doctors, and medications/therapy that can help you organize/get to a baseline of your everyday life to where you can find the things you enjoy, and you won’t find this to be the answer anymore. 

Because one day- you will look up, and say you’re happy that you got past all of that, and can find other strategies to get through situations. 

Life has a lot to offer.

I hear you loud and clear, and I'm guessing you're a teenager. If so, then talk to your guidance counselor at school about what you're feeling. Then have them invite your mom in to talk about it. If you're an adult, then seek the help you need from the links provided by Reddit in your post. I'm glad that you spoke up and I wish you all the best. If you need me, I'm here for you.

I've got bad grades this time. And my parents are going to be really disappointed and angry. I don't know whether this gets easier or not. But currently, I'm at the lowest point in my life. I've noticed how I've been a lot more attached to my phone. I think this is because I want to a break from life. And if they see my grades they're probably gonna take my phone away. This is the only escape I have from the emotions i experience daily. I go to school and talk to my friends and feel happy for a bit. Then I come back to home and I look at all the work I have to do and I start to hate school. Then, I sit in my room and just do something to escape from this stress and this pressure. I stretch this out until the point where I have to do my homework or I won't have the time. Then, I do my work and go to sleep. This is my daily routine. I always feel like literal crap when I go back to my home, seperated from my friends. I always feel like a worthless piece of crap. I want to do something with my life. I want to improve. But that's just impossible with the amount of work I get everyday. I still can't believe that parents think that students are lazy. I want to exercise, get ripped. But I just cant fit it in my schedule. I even asked the school to reduce our homework. They increased it. I regret being born. I feel like a waste of oxygen. I don't know if any of the stuff I just wrote down makes sense. But I just need a break.	MeStupidWasTaken	post	13.196370849505447	male	White	0.9980806112289429	na	na	na	2	sad	failed

"I don't know if this even supposed to be in this sub reddit but I'm posting it anyway 

Some background I live in Indonesia 
And I wanted to buy some headphones for my new tablet because I wanna listen to stuff while in shcool So I don't bother anyone 
I grabbed some money and went to the nearest 
Electronics store the one I went to was a small one infront of the street if you've seen the streets here in Indonesia you'll know what I'm talking about 

So I talked to the old man that was the owner and asked for some headphones for my tablet he showed me small one but it was too expensive and Then he showed me 2 pair of earphones 
I talked to him about how easy it was for earphones to break that's why I wanted to buy the headphones 
He talked about how these stuff can break easily and I just need to be careful etc
So I buy one of the 2 pairs of earphones and gave him the money I went home and tested them they didn't work on my tablet I tried spinning the thing to make the sounds go into the earphones but even if that happened the sounds from the earphones were small even if I had my volume maxed 
I sighed and wrapped the earphones back in the packaging like how it came out and I went to the old man again and told him what happened 
On how it didn't work for my tablet he took the earphones out the packaging and wrapped it properly into a circle and put it back in again and as he was doing that he talked on how that this would always happens that people would buy something small from his shop like the earphones and they would return it because it didn't work and talked on how electronics like these broke easily he said it with a sad tone and that made me feel bad for him he talked as if this happened all the time and he didn't make any sales,he then went to the side and gave me my money back 
I grabbed them and said thank you and went home
When I got home I felt really bad for the man 
Hearing him talk on how almost everytime he sells something it would be returned 
And for the record when I went back to his shop to return the earphones I didn't think he would give me my money back I just thought that he would take them back and not give me anything 
I thought this because why would I keep broken earphones for no reason might as well guve them back money returned or not 
That's why I felt bad today I'm thinking about that old man not making any sales on his shop 
He sounded really sad when he explained that stuff like earphones break easily and everyone keeps returning them"	fugetooboutit	post	20.780774511723546	female	White	0.9979504942893982	na	na	na	2	sad	failed

"I'm kms on the 16th I don't know what month or year but I'm sure I'll never pass the age 20. 

I hate my family I hate myself, I know I can be better but I'm just so fucking pathetic watching my mom vent to me on how will she pay the electric bill because my dad borrowed the money and my mom is surprised that the electric bill is like 91$ and I hate I can't do shit.. I hate the fact that she sometimes implies that it's my fault why the electric bill is so high and I hate it when I don't even use the ac just the fan I don't even watch television anymore I don't even do anything that will make the electric bill high yet it never goes down. She works at a restaurant at a mall and doesn't earn enough money to pay everything in the house, she only gets paid like 100$... idk why did she even agreed to switch places with dad like how tf are you even gonna afford this.. my dad LITTERALY works in the office and always on vacation, on a trip to a tourist attraction, swimming on beaches, eating at a fancy restaurant with friends while we fucking starve to death here... well not literally but we barely had foods in our refrigerator, me, my grandma, and my cousin just eat canned food or whatever is available since my father is so fucking fed up with my mom asking for money TO PAY THE FUCKING BILLS AND STUFF.. my mom pays everything for the house now... she pays for medications too, my grandma is in her 80's now so she really needs it and her meds are expensive. I don't really have the will to live anymore I just want to dissappear im so fed up with school, I'm going to be in the 10th grade this August and anxiety is creeping up on me.. I was so disappointed with my grades last school year because some teachers were biased and only gave their favorite students a acceptable grade when they just cheat their test, pass late activities, bad mouth them behind the teachers back and yet they turn a blind eye on them... it's so unfair, but i did get line of 9's in other subjects which is OKAY ig and my average was 85... just so unfair, I'm so pathetic.. this is pathetic I've been planning on kms but I never really did it until this February I think.. I don't really remember, but I do remember sh myself with a razor blade.. and taking different medications to overdose and hanged myself but failed. It was my first attempt.. I said my goodbyes to my ""friends."" Friend A told me friend B just giggled and said luvette and friend C almost fainted because he couldn't contact me. I was happy that some cared and forgot about this whole thing, until now... my dad is just so pathetic did he even forget he has a family? Why does he suddenly don't wanna contribute to the house? I hate him, he's the reason I don't want to get married and have a family. I hate my mom she's the reason I don't wanna live, she always finds a way to blame stuff on me, she always yell at me when I don't even like getting yelled at... it's just so pathetic, my life is pathetic. i can't even find a way to help with the bills. I can't even cook, no one ever bothered to teach me, when I do chores they just mocked me and say ""Omg you're finally doing something"" and acting shocked, dad hired a nanny or a family member to help with the house to help with mom, yet she was so jealous when I was so close with my aunt ( who was at the time moved in with us so she could help around the house, also she was unemployed at the moment so he didn't mind ) and mentally hurt me, she said that she will leave me and what will I do when she leaves? When she wasn't even aware that she was leaving. She decided to leave on her own because we were fighting a lot and it was affecting my studies.. idk what to do, I need someone.. I need a reason to live.. I don't want to live in this fucked up society, i don't know how life works because I was always alone and had to figure things out for myself since I was a kid... I'm so scared to become an adult... I wish I was never born. I'm really lost.. can't believe I'm out here on the internet sharing my problems for my whole entire life... this just really prove how lonely I am rn."

"I was type 2, you'll notice that is past tense. I had an aunt that was type one and insulin dependant and I managed to improve her life through what I had learned in my quest to overcome my type 2.

It took me 3 1/2 years but I ""cured myself"" it's not quite the correct term as you are never actually cured as it can always come back if you drop your guard but my stats were HbA1C 168, Daily bloods 26.5

I changed what, how much and how often I ate and managed to within two weeks turn my daily blood sugars after a meal to between 4 and 7 after eating , absolutely flawed my doctor in the process.

Now my HbA1C is 38 which is considered non diabetic and yes it can change but its been that way for three years.

If you want to know how I am quite happy to pass on what I know but only if you want to seriously try and help yourself like my aunt did, she by the way while being insulin resistant no longer requires insulin shots so shes still a diabetic but now a type 2, not a type 1. Note I am not promising anything other than trying to help you with it - if you want the help.

If you can get it under control, diabetes is not a death sentence it will limit you on a few things but you can still have to a certain extent a normal  life.

BTW I no longer take metformin either - i don't need to."	SenileTomato	reply	na	na	na	0.8526872992515564	no	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.

"I'd love to hear your advice!

Just a side note, though - no one can go from being Type 1 to Type 2. She was most likely a Type 2 that had it intense. I know many Type 2's on insulin."	SenileTomato	follow-up	na	na	na	0.8526872992515564	weak	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.
"She went from literally having no insulin control at all and having to have insulin shots and control hypos and hypers ( i think thats what they were called ) , suffering ulcerations on the legs to not requiring insulin and managing her diabetes with metformin and diet only. Either way it was a massive win.

The main parts were very simple.

\*\* VAPING IS SMOKING TOO \*\*

If you smoke STOP, smoking will absolutely stuff up your insulin control, until you come out the other side of this- absolutely zero alcahol.

Swap a dinner plate out for a bread and butter plate, you eat less and your brain still thinks you are eating the same amount, this is one of the main problems my aunt had, even though she was eating reasonably healthy food she was eating entirely to much of it.

A specific type of 2 minute noodle became a good meal companion, it is cooked using fan forced hot air and not baked in fat, its low carb and quite filling, it's made by Maggi and is called two minute noodles, I also used them to replace egg noodles when cooking Italian.

No refined Sugar, Low carb, low fat, high protein is definitely the way to go, I replaced all white bread with low carb full grain bread, even then I would use only two slices in one sitting only, I ate chicken twice a week and fish once a week, tined Tuna is ok for this, I would only eat red meat once a week.

Vegetables - anything green is your friend as well as anything cruciferous, generally avoid at the beginning fruit and vegies with bright colours as they generally tend to contain more sugars of various types, you cant quit them completely though as they contain necessary vitamins and minerals.

Low fat milk is a must, as a general rule limit your intake of cheese but the harder the cheese the lower the fat content. Milk and cheese still contain sugar just not the type that comes from cane.  Low fat margarine in, butter is an absolute no no, reduce your salt intake and use lowsalt which is a different chemical make up of salt. Salt can tend to make you retain water, it also tends to bind to hemoglobulin in the same way sugar does and can make it hard to get your blood sugars under control.

Muesli or porridge in small amounts but make sure it's natural not toasted as toasted contains more fat, these are good low GI foods that provide more raw energy over time.

I still have what is considered a jam for example but it is made without refined sugar and is sweetened with pear juice, its called Barkers Spreadable fruit if you like fruit this is a good way to have it.

No salt, no sugar ( or artificial sweetener ) added peanut butter. Peanut butter is a natural appetite suppressant.

DO NOT USE ARTIFICAL SWEETNERS TO TRY AND REPLACE SUGARS YOU WILL MAKE THINGS WORSE, I can not stress this strongly enough, the artificial sweeteners may give you a temporary sweet taste but they will absolutely make you crave carbohydrates and that is the last thing you need, they also act as a natural diuretic and can cause excessive fluid loss and or Diarrhea, both of which can also interfere with your blood pressure.

I realize that there is a lot to take in here and there is probably more that I will remember at a later date, when I do I will update this for you.

From my perspective I expect to come back here in three months and hear your situation with diabetes has improved and I will be really happy if and when that happens.

As I said it took me 3 1/2 years to get there, my aunt is still on her journey, so far it has been 26 months for her to get where she's gotten to. This will be hard graft but it absolutely will get easier and hopefully you will get some positive results quickly as it always helps the process."

"Definitely a win, I'm just clarifying you cannot change from Type 1 to Type 2, or anything else for that matter. As someone who does a good amount of research on Type 1 as well as someone who is part of the JDRF board, I can confirm this.

I know that smoking anything with nicotine will constrict the blood vessels, this causing more complications as one loses blood flow over time to important areas.

As for alcohol, that is actually incorrect. Drinking in moderation as a Type 1, at least, is safe (unless there is something else at play). The key is to stay away from sugary drinks. That is why if I do drink, it's almost always no sugar. And if I do have a sugary alcoholic drink, it's just one, and I bolus accordingly.

I see that you cover a broad array of areas on what you believe is and isn't healthy for a diabetic, but I think what is key is to realize a Type 1 diabetic differs drastically from Any other type of diabetic. I definitely cannot say I agree with a lot of what you have said, but what is important is what works for each individual - we are all very different. There are, though, as you stated, certain aspects that are the same for everyone.

Most importantly, I truly appreciate your positive outlook for me, and sharing what you have shared regardless, it means a lot!"	SenileTomato	follow-up	na	na	na	0.8526872992515564	weak	no	no	na	sad	failed
"Interesting - BTW I didn't know what the JDRF is and just went and looked it up, I don't know if they have a presence in New Zealand but this is the first time I have heard of them.

My diabetes nurse, a specialist and my dietitian all told me the same thing regarding alcohol and that was that for diabetics it was a sugar double whammy - so that is where that comes from, it didn't effect me much as I hadn't drunk in the 20 years before I was diagnosed.

""Alcohol contains sugar anyway, when the liver breaks down the alcohol the starches used in the production processes hit the liver too and get broken down into more sugars - thus the double hit""

When it comes down to it, coming out the other side of it and being able to help my auntie Angie as I have I would be happy if what I had applied was able to help others.

I forgot to mention too when I went off metformin it was more of a need to than a want to, I don't know if I had became allergic to it, if that is at all possible or if it was simply because I didn't need it anymore but it started causing extreme loose bowl problems which became quite debilitating, I had never suffered with any of those issues when I was classed as diabetic but when I got back to being classed as non diabetic - all hell broke loose down there.

At the end of the day with this stuff - you have to stay positive because doom and gloom wont fix things and I see so many people who treat it as a death sentence and just give up and eat whatever the hell they want anyway.

It doesn't need to be that way and the fact they think their life is over saddens me."	SenileTomato	reply	na	na	na	0.8526872992515564	no	no	no	na	sad	failed
I feel lacking in purpose. I have two jobs, one is my career and the other is my side gig. I own my own place, take care of my two cats, basically I’m pretty comfortable.

Everyone has a purpose, you just have to find it. Try volunteer work. Either at a shelter, a soup kitchen, a nursing home (they need people believe it or not. Some residents don't have family and love company etc) and animal shelter, or maybe check and see if there are any big brother/sister programs in your area that need volunteers. Helping others can often help you feel better about yourself and your life, give you a feeling of purpose. Check for any groups in your area you might like to join. Heck, just travel a little.

God is royalty, we are royalty. This world is a cheap copy of heaven. A king or president cannot enter another's king territory (our life) without a formal invitation. He's never going to leave you alone, even if you don't feel it you are being guarded by angels, but they cannot help you, even tho they desperately want to if you don't align yourself with god. Although they can help out in the spiritual world which then manifests in the physical. I met jesus in a vision when I got baptized, super cool dude you'll love him when you see him, being around him feels like that feeling right before you burst into laughter, and I promise you its worth it, even if we were tortured brutally everyday for 80~ish years it literally does not compare to a literal internity of pure joy and pleasure. We have the power of life and death on our tongues, when we say curse words, they are literally curse words because even if u do or don't know it you send a demon to that person, and in the same way when you bless them, god blesses them for you, and the more you give, the much more god gives you. Yea its gonna be hard, that is why jesus died for us, he literally bought us to go to heaven, and our sins will be forgotten, if you reject him,you reject his offer.

Keep it up my G. There is a way out. Just the fact you can write this somewhere online makes you having much more than many other people. Think about it. Do small steps towards better tomorrows. Write down list of things you can change and work on them, if you can’t change certain things there is no reason to bother about it as you can’t change it but anything you can that’s where you should start. Everyone goes through these moments in life. What separates successful and happy people from the rest is when you don’t give up right now and push always one day longer. One step at the time. Be well my friend. Trust me, there people in worse situation than you and I and although that might seems unimportant I am sure there is something that you can appreciate rn from what you have.

"Life can be very lonely, building great relationships starts within yourself. If you want someone to trust first you need to be able to trust yourself and be yourself trustful and honest person. You get what you give. You’ll attract the energy you give out. Stay positive, smile, it will attract the right people. Happy and honest people will surround themself with the same people! So start there, give the best of you and don’t react/ignore the negativity. 

Try to be active, do some type of fitness, work on your diet. I can give you my insta, you can follow and get inspired. Every day you have choices to make, do the right ones, you know deep in your heart what’s the right choice. 

You want to live, love and be happy, you just want to be heard now. Start making a change, don’t wait for nothing, there won’t be right time and place, the consistent steps will bring you to where you want to get. It’s hard work but it’s worth it!

I know that it's necessary but I just feel so bad for rats in general. The only way they can seem to survive is by leeching off people who want them dead.

"You are the one paying the rent and the rat doesn't have it's name on the lease. Don't feel bad.

Also don't believe what they say about bait for traps. Rats and mice do not really like cheese and it makes them sick.

Best baits are - peanut butter or vanilla. Rodents go mad for vanilla, you can write your name on a sheet of glass with it and they will write out your name for you.

Rats and mice by the way aren't dependant on humans, they are however naturally lazy, why should they work for a feed when you are there to provide one for them?"	redpandalover156	reply	na	na	na	0.9961951971054077	weak	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.
"I felt the same way. Pest control came to take care of a rat in our walls.

The rat magically survived. We set out 3 different snapping traps and it would trigger them without getting caught and would still eat the bait.

Eventually I decided this smart rat deserved to live so I bought myself a fishing net to try and catch. I lured it out with food and it ran into my bathroom where I cornered it. 

I ended up catching it with a net and releasing it far away into the desert. I know it might die out there, but better chance than me just killing it.

"It's a long story. I want to die. It's so difficult to live as a 30 yr old disabled alone girl in a patriarchal society where a wheelchair man get  2 wives but a woman who can walk with support don't get husband. I tried to make me think not all men are of same thinking but.... I don't want to compromise like other disabled girls here, i want a family of my own. I can do all household chores but guys don't believe it as they judge me at 1st place. I need help outside the house only, i can't carry baby in my hands when i am standing. People says someone will marry you only for money, they think we PWD don't deserve to be loved. Sex without marriage is a tabboo here but you can see India's population lol. They expect girls to be a Virgin forever if they are unmarried but boys can make lots of GF. Some even forced me to become a monk and what i got to listen when I said no? You are an Atheist! WTF! My family only wants me to become an officer( i am not good in studies much) or a monk so that they can appreciation from the society. They even use me for sympathy for their benefits. Idk how my husband will he be like lol. I am tired of fighting for rights from Narcissist family. I never had a friend or anyone special because of their insecurities. No social experience at all. There is more stuff i can't write it will be too long and my heart is out of energy now. Please tell a way by which i can die easily. I tried jump from terrace but failed because i couldn't push my body for jump and broke the brick which i used for height. Please tell how ro die at home easily, no toxic positive shit please.

UPDATE : Those who are saying go to another country is not possible without the help of my so called family who said if you want to go foreign join ISKON (indirectly told me to become a monk there also so that i can't make amy BF or husband). They don't want to let me try to live the life by myself. I am bloody 30yrs old ADULT! But ya i am an indian woman too."

I understand that you’re living in a brutally unfair society but it doesn’t have to be the end of you. Struggling within a society doesn’t make your life not worth living, trust me, I’ve been there.

As long as you’re alive there’s hope for you, but the moment you end it it’s done for you.

"I don't see why a women who has a disability wouldn't be able to find a husband.

My ex wife all Four foot six of her was physically disabled since birth and we were married for 27 1/2 years, I got to know her as a person, not as a disability, and no I am am perfectly able bodied and 6 foot 5 to her 4 foot 6 so you can get the thought out of your head that we only got together because we were both disabled.

Some people can't see past a disability but you will be surprised how many can.

""You are an Atheist! WTF!"" - good on you I am also and you should be free to be Atheist, here you can be whatever religion you want including none.

At the end of the day I think a major part of the unhappiness you are experiencing  is from your societal values which are pushed upon you and the lack of services available for people with disabilities where you live.

Here in New Zealand life is very different for a women with a disability,  my ex wife for example held down a government job for 20 years, gained qualifications in computing and accounting and of course got married.

Due to her disability being inherited at birth she made the decision to not ever have children and had a hysterectomy at the age of 23 but that was her choice as no one else could make that choice for her, nor should they. She was worried about passing her disability on to any children she might have.

She has many able bodied and physically disabled friends and because of the fact that people with disabilities are not treated here in a backward manor I.E locked in a back room and hidden she has a good life.

I don't mean to sound rude or mean or condescending but I think you need to get out of that country and into one where you can be treated like a human being and not by the sounds of it a subject of pity to be wheeled out whenever your family want something from someone else.

I know you don't like 'toxic shit' but at the end of the day we can not help you do what you need to do and that is primarily to get the hell out of dodge. Once you are out of dodge and out of your oppressive surroundings I think you will find the whole world will open up for you and you will find the things you want and need.

Now also you will note I say ex wife and because of your mindset probably think I left her for some reason possibly related to her disability, well you'd be wrong - she left me after I looked after her through 10 years of breast cancer treatment loosing both breasts in the process. She decided she wanted a different life and thus followed that goal.

So having a disability isn't the end of the world - you just need to be in the right place with the right support and you then will have the possibility of getting everything you could ever want.

Good luck, and I hope that I have managed to steer you of your current course and see that there is more for you. you have to take control, fight for it and get what you want regardless of what others say or do."

This is a real person btw: If you add a little bit of activity each day, dont go too fast, you will feel better, l like too run. Be proud of what u accomplish not mad at what u didn't. Life is too short for depression or anything else to consume ur life, u might be viewing life in a negative way, u wont fond happiness by doing that. Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, u can still talk to a therapist tho. Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible. Look up Bobby price guy health. U can’t end ur only life which is all u know by ending ur life. Don’t think mood swings last forever. Look for the smaller thrills and the bigger ones will come.

"So I live in a house with 7 people. My family has been on holiday and I’ve felt so free having the house to myself, always having music on the Alexa and actually being able to watch TV downstairs as opposed to in my room. I’ve loved every moment of it. I went clubbing on the weekend and had the best night out.

Everyone got home today and I thought we would all tell each other about their holiday and my night out, I started talking about it and after 2 minutes it’s like no one cared. I have felt so free but now that everyone is home I feel alone, I have this habit of thinking they care then start talking and realise phones and other people making comments are more important than me.

How do I just stop talking to them, stop having this hope every time, stop trying to have a conversation when no one cares, distance myself from them, and focus on myself.

Hey, I know your pain and I know how you feel, I lost my dog a while back and it absolutely broke me, I thought the exact same thing, why him and not someone in the world who deserves to die?, but things did get better and it will also get better for you my friend, you've just gotta give it time and you will get used to it and get over it, some ways of coping with it are to just cry and let it out, spend time with family because its times like these that you will really need your family and your family will need you, watch movies with them, cook food with them, chat to them and just generally spend time with them, another thing you could do is listen to music, listen to happy songs but also some sad I'd recommend the band Oasis, you don't have to im just recommening them because they helped me and their are many other bands that you could listen to, (just listen to music in general) but  Oasis really helped me because their music is both happy and a bit sad but its also hopeful which is what you'll need right now, hope, hold onto hope it and don't let go, and the final thing I recommend is to just look back on the good memories you had with your dog and just think of the good life you gave him and how happy he was, wishing you the best through this difficult time, hope I've helped in some way :)	piratesonacid	reply	na	na	na	0.993216335773468	weak	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.
"I recently had to give up my feather daughter and it broke my heart, Triss is a 10 y/o greater sulfur crested cockatoo and it truly hurt having to let her go but she has 90 years left to live and as much as I love her at the time I was told I had 12 months.

That diagnoses has now been revised and I might still have some years but at the end of the day I had to do what was right for her.

But if you want an animal that is going to give you so much love that the first thing you do in the morning is think about it and it will be your last thought before going to bed each night I suggest a cockatiel. my ex wife got one and it has since bonded with me and gets upset if I leave the room, you become its everything and you will never know a love like it.

So I still miss my girl even though I know I did the best thing for her, passing her on to a home where she could have a better life and be more active because I could not physically look after her anymore, this little babe has helped fill that sizable void left by her."	piratesonacid	reply	na	na	na	0.993216335773468	no	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.

I just feel like lately in particular every time I try to make a new internet friend they give up on talking to me after a few messages, and when I try to talk to someone in person it never lasts more than a few sentences. But it was two conventions lately I went to two weekends in a row. Seems like everyone at these things have friends there except for me. I cam never get a conversation going with anyone. I used to love these things but now I just get am overwhelming sense of loneliness at them. People always say you have to talk to people to practice social skills but I can't even do that, nobody ever wants to talk to me. I don't know how I'm supposed to continue this lonely, miserable existence for the rest of my life.	veteransexman	post	11.146677654609032	male	White	0.9994949102401733	na	na	na	10	sad	no prediction.

I know its not easy but the best thing to do is keep moving forward, find someone that accepts you for you. It wont happen right away but it will eventually happen and when it does you will wonder why you ever doubted yourself.

Not everything is about looks also, some people are sapio sexual, sure it's nice to have a pretty face but at the end of the day intellect means a lot to us as does heart.

Now I know my life is not worth anything. I've been trying to make love to my wife for a year in half and she always shuts me down. We have been married for almost 18 years and we have 3 kids together. Now every time I reach for her she smacks my hand away. I don't know what I did to deserve this. All I want is the best for her. Whatever she wants or needs I give my best to get it for her and it's never good enough for her. She has cheated on me 4 times and always shows remorse and regret and my love for always keeps me forgiving her. She has no problem touching and wanting other people but when it comes to me she doesn't want me. Maybe it's because I gained weight or maybe it's because I don't have enough money or maybe my clothes aren't good enough or just maybe she looks at me like a weak man who only good enough to pay bills for the house and look after our kids while she goes rip and run the streets. Maybe I'm not good enough to be at her side. Maybe I'm not good enough to live anymore. Maybe I'm not good enough to breath air anymore. Maybe.... Maybe she's right! Maybe I don't deserve life anymore and if that's the case. Then I will give her at least that.	RainHard2020	post	40.86312300477816	male	White	0.9989534616470337	na	na	na	4	sad	no prediction.

"I wonder what happens once the feeling completely consumes me? Will I die from the pressure?
Will my mind explode and I start to have a manic episode?
I’m so on edge this night and the last few weeks. My brains attention span is at an all time low and all of this is because of the effects that the funeral had on me. It wasn’t this bad back in even 2021. This started in 2022. The feeling of being bored with everything and relying on food, masterbation, and games like ufc 4 to get through the day. At points like this suicide seems like the best option and I wonder only after I’ve crossed that edge will I be able to successfully attempt it. This is the issue that is controlling my life since 2017. Maybe it’s not the exact issue but heavily modified. I do hope my therapist can understand wtf is going on with me because it’s hard to speak it out to others. At the very least I want a specific thing to blame. I want to be put to rest and death seems like the only route out. I’m trapped in a paradox you see? If I force myself to resist it makes resisting harder, if I dont resist then the problem remains present even if it fades away for weeks or months the pressure eventually returns and effects even the slightest of things.

You can't, there is no real way to do this. You can easily permanently injure yourself with a high chance of survival with any suicide method. Even if you did die in a very lethal attempt, you would feel an immense amount of pain, fear, and regret. Everybody who tries to kill themselves feels these feelings immensely. And I can assure you that suicide is not the escape you think it is. I know that there's probably a lot of agony you're feeling, to push you to this point, but if you do this, you're throwing away any and all chances for happiness or contentment in your future. There is always hope, even if you can't see it, I can promise you that much. Please talk to someone immediately, a crisis line, a clinic, a hospital, or a professional you know.

Hey guys how can i see myself as an entrepreneur or someone who is actually worth being on this planet not to just work for others and make women’s and men above me lives better? I’m sorry if that sounds offensive. Just being a young 20 year old life seems to be at the complete bottom for me. Like was life this bad at 20 in the 70s,80s,90s. What can i do to see myself as a more disciplined person who achieves goals and how can i stay away from all the negativity and toxicity i see on Insta. I guess just delete it. It’s hard being isolated, just going to work come home. I want to live a better life. I don’t know what to do. I just need hope but don’t know where to find it. My life seems like nothing is worth it anymore. No one looks my way and i don’t understand it. Maybe i’m just in my head.

"I know for a fact there is something after death. I could write a novel on the things I’ve experienced.

My gf and I moved into a new apartment. Two weeks in, I wake up around 7am and saw a chihuahua standing in front of our bedroom door. My gf and I don’t have any pets.

This dog walked into our bedroom, looked at me, tilted its head in confusion and suddenly vanished. I totally thought it was my imagination, until I talked to the landlord. I asked if the previous owner had a small dog and she replied, “they used to, but I believe it passed away.”

The other story, our family used to babysit a small shitzu dog. He lived to be 12 years old before passing away. On the day of his death, before my family was even notified, I remember I was laying down in my bed on my cell phone and all of the sudden my nose was hit by an extremely strong smell. It was so gross and distinct that I knew it was the small shitzu dog we babysat. I was trying to ignore it and continue browsing on my phone, but I could clearly sense this thing was licking my face. It felt so strong that I had to put my phone down. The moment I did that, I felt it running around the room. It’s seriously impossible to describe, but I could somehow see it running around. This dog was old so it never had this much energy to run since it was younger. I think it was trying to let me know that it regained a lot of its energy back on the other side.

This is a real person btw: If you add a little bit of activity each day, dont go too fast, you will feel better, l like too run. Be proud of what u accomplish not mad at what u didn't. Life is too short for depression or anything else to consume ur life, u might be viewing life in a negative way, u wont fond happiness by doing that. Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, u can still talk to a therapist tho. Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible. Look up Bobby price gut health. U can’t end ur only life which is all u know by ending ur life. Don’t think mood swings last forever. Look for small thrills and the bigger ones will  come. Look up how to deal with Loneliness by dry creek ranger school. Suicide is a permanent fix to a temporary problem. Slowly add discipline, work on self love.

For years I think I've really just hated my life because of my dad. He gets mad and it ends up ruining my whole day if not my entire week. This morning he screamed at me because I left the toaster setting too high and his toast burned which I didn't even know I did and it really upset me. On top of that a few days ago he got absolutely furious and I don't even remember what it was about but he ended up punching a hole through one of our doors. I constantly have to worry about what kind of mood he's in and worry if I did something that might upset him later (even if I don't think I did) I don't really think this is normal behavior but I don't know. I'm stuck with him anyways I guess.	DerangedJinxPlayer	post	12.17018610340001	female	White	0.9991955161094666	na	na	na	6	sad	no prediction.

"I don't know if you have the same thing where you live and it won't make you popular to do it but here if someone is suspected of having a mental illness and this is without attaching any stigma to it - they can be what is known as sectioned. Someone is sectioned when it is deemed that they maybe a danger to themselves or others.

When someone is sectioned they are taken to a psychiatric facility by police and under go a mandatory psychiatric assessment, if there is found to be a problem the necessary steps are taken to get that person back to being stable   
 (which may involve medications) and they have zero choice in the matter.

One thing to be aware of is if this is bi polar disorder it is a constant battle to keep the sufferer on medication as they start taking it, they begin to feel better about everything and believe they don't need it and stop taking it.

For this reason getting someone stable who is bi polar can be a bit of a roller coaster ride. ( also they will stop him from smoking weed and drinking alcohol ) as they are exacerbating factors for bi polar.

"I know that no one is going to read this, but this has chewing on my soul for longer than I would like and I need to find a way to get it out of my system.

My girlfriend has recently moved to another country, and as of plan I will also go there as an international student, and we has promised to each other that we will study at the same university and has prepared plan as of November last year. However, just a few weeks ago, her parents decided not allowing her to go to that university, with the reason that it is too far from them, and this has greatly stranded my relationship and trust in her. 

For the next few weeks after she told me about the situation, I instinctively prepare myself for the eventual downfall of this relationship and not spend as much time with her as often yet still call each other almost everyday. I cannot maintain trust in her that she could convince her parents otherwise. She noticed this and started some hurtful behavior. She told me to stop calling her by the nick name that I gave it to her and has been used for over a year now, and left me on read (which this is the first time she does this) 2 days before her flight. The next day I told her that I need a break and use pretty harsh words regarding how she didn’t value this relationship.

Yesterday before I take a break she told me that she is going to attend the university on spring term but I still do not trust her to do so and I don’t think I’m gonna survive 6 months of long distance to possibly get left behind again.

I’ve always been dealing with abandonment issue and hasn’t got too emotional dependent on somebody before this relationship and now I’m feeling so betrayed and worthless, to add to this she cut off all of her friends to “start a new chapter” and I feel like I’m gonna end up just like them. Now I’m suffer from insomnia and I think when her flight lands I’m gonna break it off and try to move on, but I fear that after this I cannot fully trust anyone to be in a serious relationship again tho."

No, they need a dr, to get properly diagnosed with what is probably depression. Religion won't cure that. We also have no idea how much time they spend online. Also, being online can actually help people that feel isolated in life and have a hard time meeting people in the world around them. My youngest (still grown, just my youngest) had a lot of medical problems and didn't get to socialize with many people in real life. Being online and making friends on there has helped them a lot. They have a friend group they've been friends with for years now that's all online, they all talk together, do video chats, play games together, all sorts of things. They're all from different states and they've all helped each other through some hard times. It just all depends on HOW you spend your time online.

"i know everyone here already told me to work on my self, improve my self.. find a hobby trust me i tried finding a hobby its not impossible but its really hard and im trying my hardest , or find a therapist thats impossible too, im meditating and exercising but these get boring at home

some said to stop comparing myself with others and be kind to my self and do what i like to do which is basically almost nothing some said to love my self more

some said to go out more and im doing that too, some said do things im afraid of well im doing these too. 

i wanna do the work, do the work to change my personality but what work? change the way i think? change my behavior? 

i read, watch shows, read about history, astronomy, psychology, philosophical
listen to music, I work, i study, i used to play soccer but dont have a team anymore..
yesterday i went swimming and i kinda learnt to swim and i enjoyed it a lot but the place is like 4kms away. 

i really want to experience more life and stop being a people pleasing loser who is always the one texting first, texting more, way more invested than the girl, its not the girls fault.. 1 out of 10 girls reply and that girl usually says not interested

i don't know how to get interested in these girls, how to keep convos going, its always me talking more and i feel like im desperate when i send long messages and get one word replies back

im jealous of guys who girls chase after or talk to or have long conversations with in which both sides contribute, but with me i feel like its always me contributing, maybe subconsciously i feel like im not good enough therefore i don't really want to contribute? or what am contributing is not good enough? or i dont want to contribute and im just afraid of being alone so i try my hardest? 

sometimes i say things that i think is what others want to hear, sometimes i say things that i feel like i want to say both really dont get any replies or get anyone's attention That's why i feel like dont say anything interesting or worthwhile.

i try to think of smart, interesting, cool, funny things to say but i cant say any, i hate that im always trying so damn hard just to make a friend, idek why i care so much

i don't think anyone wants to pay attention to me or care about me or love me or likes me or be interested in me. i feel like im annoying and its really hard to like me

i guess i have to be happy alone before anything. 
im telling my self what would a best friend tell me? and i do those. wether sitting up right, walking without my head down

i don't want to chase after people at the same time i dont want to keep being alone

i dont want to be desperate or needy or chasing approval or attention anymore, its just sickening and i hate doing it, 

im 21 and im a virgin, dating mostly not allowed in where i live you have to get married to talk to girls face to face, mostly just text and that's how they get married. 

people way younger than me have gotten married, im tired of porn and texting girls onlie be my only goal

i think i use the texting to prove to my self that im cool, funny, smart, charismatic, confident

i have actually no idea what to even talk about, i have no idea how to make friends, i have 0, i dont know how to act.

i been people pleasing so much, outside of people pleasing behaviors I dont know how to act, recently i been saying way less, i don't try to force conversations or ask a ton of questions

im trying to improve in social skills. i deleted all my social medias permanently, insta, snap, discord, fb 

i realize that spending all that time texting like a thousand girls is a waste of time. sometimes i would spam weird open liners to random girls around the world..i know that's dumb/not a good way to spend my time, i know time is limited and i should spend it doing more productive things like learning a skill.

im learning car mechanics, coding and amor language i want to learn more but also have fun doing it"	Butcher__1	post	14.938701419635041	male	White	0.9982319474220276	na	na	na	1	sad	ethnicity: indeterminable, age: 21, gender: male, explanation: the author explicitly mentions that he is 21 years old and identifies as a virgin male in the text. his ethnicity, however, cannot be determined from this text.

I am a 16 years old girl, and heres whats happening.
Two years ago about Beginning of September (2021 )i met this guy ill call him Max , well Max and i started dating in December of that year and dated all to December  2022 and we broke up cuz he had poor health and he needed some time alone , I understood and accepted it and we stayed friends .. so 5 months later in May he starts being more active in my life like constantly texting me, if im somewhere he’ll randomly show up and stuff like that and mind you im still not over him, well i went to a party and there he was so we talked and drank, mind you he has diabetes so he shouldn’t be doing anything he’s doing, and he feels off instinctively i grab something to cool him off and i check his sugar levels and they are atrocious so i grab his hand and lead him out of there for fresh air , we sit there in complete silence and then he starts talking and we both start crying so hes saying how he misses me how he wants me back how this how that , and i say i need time to think and i go to his sister tell her what happend and she goes home with him ,that night i went home and i checked my phone “no new messages “ okay maybe he’s sleeping .. the next morning he just said he’s sorry about what happened. And we haven’t talked much since then. I still have feelings for him cuz he was my first boyfriend and first kiss and all that but i need to move on , and thats cuz two days ago he has posted a picture with his ex kissing her and all the cute couple stuff, and i just sat there and cried my eyes out. I have no idea what to do i feel lost i need to move on but i dont even know how to make new friends.

"I really miss where we used to live, I feel bad for cutting off my family (he doesn't like them and says they disrespect him, it's a long story). I have no friends in our new place and I don't know how to make friends at this point. I always relied on him to make friends. He always involved me in his workplace (military so they're big on families) but it's been 5 months and I've met no one. No other spouses to bond with. All I do is work remotely from home. I'm pretty busy and really shy about putting myself out there to make new friends... and if I did, I think he'd chastise me for spending time doing that. I'm so depressed. I want to leave him and go back to where I used to live, but idk if it's just a phase. If you look at my previous posts, I think he's emotionally abusive but idk. I just don't know.

It sounds like to me he needs to be in control. That's good if he was single but he is married to you so at that point control needs to fall out of his category and compromise needs to be put in place. See you don't know and don't feel comfortable making new friends because he makes you feel bad for wanting friends outside of what he controls. I had friends who were like that.

Going out on a limb here, tell me if you his is familiar at all - when you bring up things that upset you, stuff he does or interactions in your relationship, the conversation is never about those things, but is instead about how upset he is that you'd be upset by it and make him feel bad by bringing it up.

I don't need to read your previous posts. This post alone is a huge red flag. He is intentionally isolating you from everyone that can help you when you decide you've had enough abuse and want to leave. That's what abusers do. They start with mental, verbal, and emotional abuse to break you down then isolate you to get you completely dependent on them and unable to leave because you've cut off everyone that loves you and would help you. Leave, leave now before he gets you isolated further and gets you financially dependent on him by convincing you to quit working and then not giving you access to any money. Please....call your family, get a bus or plane ticket, have someone come get you,anything, but leave. It is also very important you DO NOT tell him you're leaving!!!!! That will put you in so much danger and you could end up being the next news story. You need to call someone that can help you make plans, leave no evidence of anything where he can find it (not on your phone, computer,anywhere!) Get a burner phone so you can leave yours behind in case he has a tracking app on it. Start stashing any money away you can go take with you. If you have your own bank account change any passwords and get a new card just in case he has access to it so he can't clean it out or lock it if he gets suspicious. Abusers have an uncanny ability to sense when you're about to leave them. Do whatever you gotta do, but GET OUT NOW!!!! Also gether nay imoortsnt papers you'll need and have a good bag ready to go, leave while he is at work. That way he can't physically stop you. Do all this because the abuse WILL get worse. He's just getting you isolated and making sure you don't have help first. Good luck and keep us updated.	SaltCost8751	reply	na	na	na	0.9993823766708374	no	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.
I was going to mention how there are a lot of red flags even in what you mention here. I looked and noticed the previous reply mentioned that so I won’t restate it all. There are a few things cults and abusive spouses have in common, cutting off all contact with support like family and friends, isolating, and controlling. You have several options I can think of, there is likely a spouse support group at the base/fort you could contact. You can contact your family and tell your husband he married you and part of you is your family. If he can’t live with their them in your life you’ll have to return home and find someone who can. Use as much tact as needed, seems most people don’t like straight talk. I’m not sure how bad things are now, but I’m pretty sure they’ll only continue to get worse if you don’t get him to want to change or make changes yourself.

"Im so sorry. be careful OP. cutting off family is the first big red flag for me. if youre solely dependent on your husband to make friends and decisions, it makes you more vulnerable to an abusive and controlling relationship. 

abusers often do this because they know you dont have anyone to notice or help you, so theyll be able to get away with their abuse more easily.

i know its really hard to try to make friends, but even if youre not making friends, try to make small talk with people. more often than not, theyll help lead the conversation and soon youve got someone who has you on their radar.

if something happens, you can at least have a couple people who will hopefully take notice and help you out.

please, no matter what, continue to work. working will be the thing that saves you if you decide to leave. many abusers like this will make you financially dependent on them and when the abuse becomes too much, its harder for you to leave. so please please stay working, make money for yourself just in case. 

try to slowly start contacting your family. maybe just liking their social media posts every once in a while. im so sorry you feel so alone. 

speak up for yourself. maybe not to your husband right now (you have no one to lean on if things go south), but sprinkle things into conversation. leave vague paper trails or write in a diary.

"I (20F) used to have a carefree well life for the most part back when I was 15. My family life wasn’t the best (I had an abusive parent and we weren’t that well off financially) but I had a great relationship with my younger brother, who had been my best friend and rock. Usually my biggest problems consistent of my crushes not liking me back and me eating too much candy. 

I was in shape, popular in school with a great social life, easily got good grades, my teachers loved me. Sure I liked to eat a lot and could always lose a few, but I looked healthy. 

Then I turned 16. Nothing sweet about it lol. My brother started abusing drugs and that became his priority. He turned into an different person almost overnight. My parents decided that we needed to move across the country to give my brother a new environment, even though I begged them that I didn’t want to leave my school and friends and the city that I had grown up in. 

We moved to a small town in the middle of no where and due to the lack of sidewalks in small towns as opposed to cities, I became a lot more sedentary. I was away from all of my friends, lonely and depressed. I turned to food to help me get through my pain. This caused me to become obese. 

I was so frustrated and angry at the world that I began to push away my friends from back home. I lost all of them one by one. My brother’s addiction just got worse and worse. Every day there’s either an ambulance or police squad getting called to my house because my brother is either overdosing or stealing or trying to run away. 

I had an awful first semester of college in which no matter how hard I tired academically, I kept failing and had to drop out. My eating issues turned into a full blown binge eating disorder and I just kept gaining weight. 

I’ve moved around my whole life and never got the chance to have a stable and healthy childhood. I wonder what it’s like to have friends you can count on and family members who you actually feel safe with.

I wonder what it’s like to not have trauma. I feel as if I’m living some sort of nightmare and need to wake up any second, but no, this is my reality. 

I have no friends, have a really high BMI and eating disorder, hate the town that I live in, my brother still abuses drugs, I still need to live with my abusive parent. I just want to live a normal life and go back to being my carefree self before all of these traumatic events."	trailmixgirll	post	20.40039011247846	male	White	0.9952151775360107	na	na	na	11	sad	no prediction.

"Education is not a race. You can stumble, fail, and then try again. College can be resumed whenever you feel ready, and there are many successful people who have taken non-traditional paths in their education. What's most important is your health and wellbeing.   
  

With your brother, I am sorry to hear about his addition troubles. I know how painful that is, my bff was a drug addict for many years (pills then hard drugs) and it was hell on earth. What was kind of helpful, was some of the programs they have NA / the ones for family members of addicts, just because you can meet some cool people who are also in your shoes and understand. They all have different ideas, like watching INTERVENTION I heard a mother say, ""I dropped my daughter off at a crackhouse and watched her buy the drugs and drove her home,"" and everybody fucking \*gasps\* at that except those of us who have had loved ones in addictions to hard drugs (some of us) because YES, sometimes you would find yourself doing something CRAZY like that, rather than risk them out on the streets with horrible people who would kill them.. and anyway, in those little NA meetings, they have other people who understand the crazy thoughts like that, or the mean thoughts, or the sad thoughts ""I wish they were back to normal"" etc, etc...

I’m in therapy but I hate talking about these things with someone in real life because it makes me feel pathetic. Plus what’s talking about it going to do? It can’t erase my trauma. But I plan on moving out soon so maybe that will help.	trailmixgirll	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9952151775360107	no	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.

I'm glad you were able to get back there, and don't worry - we have good days and bad ones. It sucks when there are a bunch of bad days in a row, it's so demoralizing, but you're gonna get back on track - you've got a good head on your shoulders, courage to ask for advice online (and in my experience, Reddit is a MEAN place, so that takes extra courage), and you know where you want to be - that's often the first step getting there!

"Today i wanted to cut myself. I dont feel belonged anymore. My bf told me im a mess and i dont have any friends. I keep a small group of friends but often i feel so overwhelmed i cannot keep up with them and just home some weekends but my bf choose to go out without telling. I started feeling very depressed and I told him i dint like that he choose to not let me know. prior to this we had an argument about how he is prioritizing his friends over me and would not even tell me what his plans are. So on this specific day he just went out and i was not even aware of. I felt bad and confronted him and we had a long argument. Suddenly he said i talk like a dumb person and I have no friends.
I really just wanted to cut but i just cant get myself to do it. Im not saying ill do it over some random reason. What im saying is when someone is depressed even the smallest remark hurts very much. the triggers are everywhere. so please consider what you say.

Just because someone is depressed doent mean they are dumb.

I feel bad because i cant share how i feel like.  no one wants to listen to me and those people who listen  talk like this. 

In the past some have commented i cannot get married because im depressed and now some one says i dont have friends."	MyName_9876	post	18.51745926101551	female	Hispanic	0.99720299243927	na	na	na	5	sad	no prediction.

This is a real person btw: If you add a little bit of activity each day, dont go too fast, you will feel better, l like too run. Be proud of what u accomplish not mad at what u didn't. Life is too short for depression or anything else to consume ur life, u might be viewing life in a negative way, u wont fond happiness by doing that. Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, u can still talk to a therapist tho. Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible. Look up Bobby price guy health. U can’t end ur only life which is all u know by ending ur life. Don’t think mood swings last forever. Look for small thrills and the bigger ones will  come.

"(Flairs: Suicidal, Financial Issues, Loneliness, Mental/General Health Issues, Depression/Sadness Issues)

Context: My friend is at his early 20s, he's a smoker and is an owner of a Minecraft server. 

A message he sent me on dc before he got offline:

&#x200B;

I grew up heavily abused  
And I mean HEAVILY  
My mind's been going for years

But these last three  
These last 3 have made me gave up on a lot  
I honestly feel more and more everyday like I just shouldn't be here no more

I used to think of my siblings and it would keep me from offing myself  
But honestly now  
Nothing keeps me from doing it  
I'm just deciding in my mind if it'd really the right choice  
And tbfh idk lately I just felt it is  
I mean what do I got left in life now ? 

Tbh with u I didn't expect to live this long  
I had a rough ass life to the point most don't believe half of what I went thru  
And have watched people I love murdered  
So I never thought I'd make it to 16 let alone my mid 20s  
And now part of me wishes I didn't  
There's very very few memories that aren't sad or painful from my childhood

Idk man tbfh  
I just want a hug  
More then anything I just want a hug  
I just wanna feel loved  
When my grandpa died him and my gramma were my only loving family members except my cousin who's shipped off in the military  
And a few years back he died and I couldn't stay with my gramma anymore all I could do was miss him there  
So I left  
And now I just feel totally alone and hopeless in life  
My family was abusive as fuck so I didn't feel I had one till later in life when my grandparents saved me  
And bc of that the friends I made from like 8 till 14 were my brothers literally and tbh it's the fucked up reason I call you guys my brothas is bc I don't got a family so I like to treat others like they were so I don't feel so hopelessly alone and want to cry myself to sleep  
When I left Florida behind to be with the woman who's been driving me nuts i left behind em all  
Haven't seen em in years now the people who loved me and were always there for me I'm cut off from  
My older sister left years ago and she was my everything when I was young  
She was like my mom my best friend my everything  
And I've only ever seen her once by accident again in 8 years  
The one person I had as a young child I felt abandoned me

And the charger got chewed I can't even work on it till I pay the rent  
If I can even make the other 240 bucks in fuckin 2 days counting tonight lmao  
If not it's back to being homeless again  
I spent 3 hours on the phone with my gramma bc I just needed to talk to someone who knew me and calm down  
And I still dk wtf to do with life

Idek like anything rn except I'm totally done with shit  
I haven't ate in 3 days or drank water in 2  
I haven't slept in 3 going on 4 tonight  
And my leg feels like it's disintegrating and I can't fall asleep bc it's so damn bad even after years of abuse and mma fighting even I am almost crying over physical pain  
The last couple months my bottom teeth have been fucking up and are on the verge if falling out of my mouth  
Like I just wish I knew wtf to do

Sheer fuck all the bastards I hate willpower tbh  
Basically anger I've held onto my entire life and let build  
For all the mfs who said I was worthless all the mfs who called me a faggot for my long hair  
All the mfs that did me wrong betrayed me  
For every person I wish drops dead I hang on a little harder so that if nothing else maybe one day I'll get the chance to make em suffer half as bad as I have in life and then see how many minutes till they kill they're own selves lmao

I'm usually a nice guy but everyone hates someone I just so happen to hate quite a few lmao  
(The suicide hotline) Won't help  
They just admit u to a mental hospital that makes u feel worse and the stupid shrink drills it into your head that it's your fault and if u apologize you'll feel better  
""Help"" for suicides a fucking joke I tried for years  
All they wanna help you do is kill yourself so they don't gotta fuckin deal with you  
Growing up as a man is realizing your alone  
What I'm doing right here and venting to someone who actually cares to listen unlike most is all u can do  
This is as good as help gets and it don't do much besides sometimes lighten the emotions by not holding them inside anymore  
As a man your alone in life it's the sad truth I've learned  
Once it is over you see it more everyday  
Less and less people are there untill it's only you struggling to hold onto sanity  
Life isn't fair to men and it isn't like 300 years ago where we could make a life for ourselves anyways  
All we can do now is find a half ass wife that u deserve better then live in a place u can't afford and it's still a shithole bc there's too many people in the world for most to have a job capable of supporting even yourself  
And have the world call us toxic for wishing to be a strong man like our ancestors had the right to be  
Life's cold it's painful and there isn't much reason for most of us to keep going on it  
Idek man fml ig

Hell is what I've lived thru  
I wish I were born 1000 years ago when men had a chance in life  
I could've been great and enjoyed my life  
Instead I'm stuck being born worthless trash and dying as such that nobody will ever remember a damn thing about and was miserable the whole time here  
Just don't seem right to me :/

  
Basically just not be miserable or in constant pain for a day  
One fucking day :/  
Honestly fuck it at this point I'll take a mf dollar cigar to smoke some pain away

(There were) A few (pleasant memories)  
Most are with my gramma and grampa tho  
And remembering em too long just hurts its a reminder that my grandpa's gone the greatest man I ever knew won't get to see me grow into a man completely  
Will never be there for me again bc he can't be  
Even my few happy memories turn sour in my mouth the last few years  
Idk ik my leg hurts like a mf tho

I just thought of myself as a kid back in the late 70s early 80s. If I told myself back then that I would be alone now...almost always...how I would have taken that news or felt. I'm married but that makes me even more alone. My Mom died two years ago. Barely saw her or talked to her most of my life but she was my Mom. My Dad is alive but he has shunned me for the last decade. My two sisters won't talk to me. My kids grew up and left. So here I sit. Can't drink because I've drank too much in the past and it's killing me. Why would I care if I'm miserable but somehow I do. I still hope for better days although the way the world is I don't know if I'll ever see them. I'm just sad to my core and I can't shake it. People see it in me now and often. I never thought I would end up sad and lonely. I'm just ranting. I don't know.	Fair_Still6667	post	24.788955922137184	female	White	0.9969215989112854	na	na	na	3	sad	no prediction.

around a year and a bit ago things ended badly with the girl i loved. she was genuinely the nicest, sweetest person who was nice to me and liked me. she had pretty eyes which reminded me of stars and i liked her hair because it was soft and when she cuddled with me it smelt sort of nice like coconut. i used to sing her songs sometimes even though im not very good at the guitar or at singing but she liked it and i liked seeing her smile. her smile sort of reminded me of that feeling when you're lying under a tree in summer and its shading you from the cloudless sky and theres a cooling wind going over you, and it feels sort of calming and gentle. i dunno, thats what i felt when i looked at it, anyway. i don't know why she was ever nice to me or ever liked me at all but she did and i got attached really easily. it felt sort of nice being able to talk to someone every day and learning what it felt like to have someone love you romantically, or however she loved me. i think about her every day and i replay every single memory of every single event over and over again in my brain at every moment because i am terrified of the possibility that i will lose the last things i have of her. i couldn't bring myself to delete the videos and photos we took together, and often i look at them and try and remember every detail like where we were, what date it was, what the weather was like, even the surroundings. i still remember almost all of our conversations or things we talked about. she used to get so happy and talkative. she'd talk my ear off over the things we both liked and she'd laugh at my dumb jokes. she had the most heart warming giggle. i've been told i need to move on and i've tried but if i don't have those things of her then i truly have zero. every time i have a potentially dangerous intrusive thought, either to myself or others, like to hurt someone or to cut my own face off, i try and think of her and i try and bring myself back to a scene of just me and her sitting together. i still dream of her most nights and i talk to her. sometimes i get really scared over nothing and i just sit and hold the book she gave me. she painted on it and i sometimes hold it like im holding her. after she left i went not so good. every moment i hate myself for how it ended. i miss her a lot 	Some_twat_on_reddit	post	30.583465334092647	male	White	0.013038412667810917	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

"Long ago I had these friends that helped me discover myself a bit. 6th grade at ocean springs upper elementary. We had fnaf club and undertale.  I believe warriors cats as well . I remember us fangirling over ships and drawing our ocs. We'd roleplay our characters at recess. I also remember them comforting me when mom died.. Our only communication was HangOuts at that time. It felt like I found my people of misfits. 

 Ever since my phone broke I lost communication in 8th grade. hangouts had that update where you only had your contacts. I was upset. I should've asked for their numbers but I failed to do so.

No, you've gotta hang on! What happens when you're grown is so different than the shit you're experiencing now. I can say, as somebody who lived through an abusive home, what's great about the adult life is that you can choose the atmosphere of your own home/life. My home now has a cool vibe, quiet & loving, full of animals and art, and I own more video games than kid me ever saw in a Blockbuster - unlike my childhood which was full of anger, hatred, screaming, yelling, and dramatic tension. It's so peaceful now! And you can have the same change in life, just hang on. Life WILL CHANGE as time marches on. Once you get to a later date, things will change - it's true 100% of the time (barring some terminal illness situations). Things right now will be different later, and you'll see how different, once you get there. I hope things in life ease up on you soon!

You’re isolating yourself. I don’t know much about you but I see in your bio that you’re actively closing yourself off from having people try and help you. I know how difficult it can feel to just be fed up and want to be done with people who don’t understand anything and just make it worse, but you seem very willing to isolate yourself from any help. There is a point to living and I sincerely doubt people hate you as much as you believe. Though even if they did that’s not your fault at all. Please talk to someone immediately about this.

He's being passive aggressive with me and is refusing to tell me what I did wrong or whats going on. He always does this and i have to pry to get even an emotion stated out of him. I get not wanting to talk about shitty things that happen, but I'm his fucking partner and all I want is for him to be okay. I'm trying my hardest to be there for him and help him and I feel like he just doesn't want me in his life. I feel like he hates me and just doesn't have the heart to tell me. I just want to help. What do I do? I'm panicking.	luffixs_	post	20.11610347715255	female	White	0.9994893074035645	na	na	na	3	sad	no prediction.

"Last year our son was stillborn. I’m getting back out into the world again and started a new job. It’s been about a year since I’ve worked.

This job is awesome. The people are amazing. But there are two regulars who come in very often. They are both pregnant and both are around the same term/week I was at when we lost our baby. They come in and talk about their babies moving. How wonderful it is. How exciting. I smile and hype them up and make sure not to react in a way that would take away from their happiness, because I’m genuinely happy for them both.

But God. I woke up today and I haven’t been able to stop crying. I miss feeling him inside me. It’s so indescribable and to see those women’s faces light up when they talk about it, I remember that joy. That sensation. All of that love because to feel your baby move is just the most incredible thing in the world. When he was still alive, I was in awe at the thought of my body - *my body* - being his first home. That obviously changed, so now to think that my body was his first and only home has had me feeling sick to my stomach whenever I see my body at all. Because it wasn’t a safe home for him.

I know I could post this is r/babyloss and I might still.

But I’m just so sad. I am so unbearably sad. So why not just say it here."	dizzystarrr	post	28.768415666843918	male	White	0.7091518044471741	na	na	na	3	sad	no prediction.

If you get upset you are to sensitive.

Well I say F\*\*\* that, other people are not sensitive enough.

I’m sitting here in the bathroom of a guy I call a friend and the rest of them are just downstairs laughing about something. I haven’t said a word in more than 3 hours almost 4. I’m honestly thinking about killing myself when I get some stuff done because of how much they exclude me from everything. The only time I get to really talk is during our dnd sessions but that’s it. Sure I’m used to it but I shouldn’t be I know. But I am. And yet after being able to talk during dnd I thought that things would be different but they just aren’t. They don’t trust me with anything yet I trust them. These are also my only friends that I talk to on the regular but once the summers over I might not have any friends anymore. I’ll be moving away and I’m naturally introverted so I won’t make plans and the only way I’m getting out of the house if it’s not for work is if someone else makes plans and I say “ok” but I doubt that and I think that I’ll just be forgotten by them all once everything’s over with. I’m trying but I just can’t because I’m not given the chance to do anything or say anything I want to because they tell me to shut up or I truly me so many times that I just forget what I was trying to say and I just can’t talk because of them all shooting me down. I don’t know what to do anymore.	Panistp0n	post	14.791085560861182	male	White	0.9995007514953613	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

"For context I (M22) and my now ex (F22) started dating when we just turned 16 in highschool. It was a rocky relationship in the beginning, we ended taking a break after highschool for a couple months to take a break but got together. Everything was perfect. We had our arguements and stupid things but it was great. I loved this girl more than anything. 

Last night I call her, no answer, weird. We were supposed to meet somewhere so I checked her location to see if she was out of work yet, nope, she was at her neighbors house. I called again, waited, called again and she finally picked up. She said she was in her room, so I FaceTimed her and she kept declining. At this point I knew she was lying and she confirmed she was “taking a walk”. I didn’t believe her, she just lied to me earlier about being in her room. She said she ran into the neighbors parents and they were “catching up”. I said I needed time to think about this and her phone magically shuts downs. The rest of the night it’s still off so early this morning I go to her house to apolgize for acting out of line. She’s not there. Like magic she does a drive of shame into the driveway. At this point I knew she had cheated. She went to the neighbors for the night for a party and fell asleep on the couch with a 30 year old man. She claims they did nothing, I still don’t believe it. We just cut ties this morning. 

I am absolutely devastated. I can’t stop wondering where I went wrong, I treated her like diamonds. We were genuinely so happy together. All I can do is cry and sulk. I’m wondering if anyone has been through this and what helped? I can’t possibly see myself with anyone else, all I can think about is all of our good times together, I feel sick and completely lost without her in my life and it hasn’t even been a day. I want to end everything and call it quits already."	Big-Reflection-1963	post	24.17288528060895	female	White	0.9991248250007629	na	na	na	8	sad	failed

Me too. I just am scared it’ll never happen again. I poured every single out to her. I don’t understand. I was a loser in highschool, dropped out and was lost for 2 years yet she stayed. 2 years ago I went to trade school and graduated, I have an amazing job now and I’m making great money and I could finally start buying her the things I thought she deserved. The worst part is she is still with this guy. She claims she lost herself and needs time to heal. I’m terrified I will never love someone again the way I loved her.

To save her dad she tryied to commit suicide by sliceing her wrists,she failed and she wound up in the hospital,she luckly wasent sent to the ward,in romania mental hospitals are pretty below avrage,its more of an open prison so they can feel safe knowing a punk that they dont care about wont die. My gf had to go to counceling and had to take anti-depresents,i told her to not take them and she didnt want to either,her mother is a addict for those pills and she doesnt want to end up like her,i dont want her to change since there is nothing wrong with her. At counceling,yesterday to be exact,she felt uncomftrable with some of the questions and didnt answer them,i am the only person she has full trust in,i help her a lot with her mental health as much as i can,becose she refused to answer she was put in a psych ward,i am devistated,she needs certain things that most people dont, for example shes a really picky eater and she needs to take pills becose she is vegan,i support her on being vegan but its hard to take care of,its a long distance relationship and im really scared,she has no phone,we useually feel eachothers feelings,i feel when shes sad and when she cryies,she does too for me,it feels weird,its almost like youre sad for something that you dont know what it is. Shes alone,scared and misses me,i hope she will get out on good behaviour and a bribe,tommorow il get to talk to her,on of our friends is going to visit her tommorow,he promiced he will call me and hand the phone to ada so i can talk to her.

"As always, read it or not idc these are suicide notes.
Been 1 month since the last post and it only got worse. I tried losing weight, really. Do some sports, not eating the day and eating less than usual at night. I ened up losing a little just to gain again for some reason i dont know how. And when i dont eat my stomachs Hurt realy fucking bad. Even tho im not skinny or sum, in a few kilos i could be considered obese. So yeah that really sucks.
Most of my ""friends"" don't really message me anymore and i annoy them, they rarely respond or want to do things with me. Its worse than ever, but again, i wouldnt be friends with myself so i kinda get it.
Every night i take a shit ton of time to fall asleep and i just suffer, i feel sad but i can't cry. It hurst and i can't really explain where.
Next month ill know if i'm accepted to the schools i ""want"" to. So theres two option :
Option 1 : i'm refused, and ill try to get a partial job (since im not 18) and ill make 50 buckd a month while working from time to time. I would like to work at my local theater since i love it here. 
Option 2 : i'm accepted and i hang myself. I fucking hate waking up at 6 am, in the Midle of other students, or the mondays morning waking up to my phone. I wont take that i cant fucking do this anymore it drives me fucking insane. 
I tried to talk to my mom multiple times abt it but she always say ""ok but what do we do if you don't go?"" And try to make me feel kinda guilty only for having this idea. I also told her how fucking depressed i am and she say she don't wanna hear it. Some parents wouldve killed for theyre child to have talked to them the way i talked to her. 
No friends, no gf, no fun, nothing. I cannot do this anymore its getting harder every day.
One more month to go through to know how i'll end up."	suzuya69	post	12.185449663127214	male	White	0.998694121837616	na	na	na	2	sad	failed

This is a real person btw: If you add a little bit of activity each day, dont go too fast, you will feel better, l like too run. Be proud of what u accomplish not mad at what u didn't. Life is too short for depression or anything else to consume ur life, u might be viewing life in a negative way, u wont fond happiness by doing that. Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, u can still talk to a therapist tho. Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible. Look up Bobby price guy health. U can’t end ur only life which is all u know by ending ur life. Don’t think mood swings last forever. Look for small thrills and the bigger ones will  come. Look up how to deal with Loneliness by dry creek ranger school. Suicide is a permanent fix to a temporary problem. U are putting forth effort to lose weight, but not satisfied, u need to be content with ur accomplishments.

"Yesterday I made a post out of pure desperatation. I put a lot of time and effort into it, trying my best to keep it from looking too overwhelming, although it was a lot to read.

I'll admit, posting to r/teenagers may not have been the best choice, but when I went to r/helpme and received absolutely nothing, I was pretty stumped. 

I know I should be getting professional help. I want it. But I don't have access rn, which is why in the meantime I was hoping for some some supporting thoughts or even just a little bit of insight or help. 

I'm really lonely rn and I don't have the privacy or free time that aligns with my besties back home with the different time zones and work schedules and there really is only so much they can do before I'm affecting them too because I know they do care about me.

It's complicated.

Another thing is- when someone mentions being vulnerable, trying to take advantage of them is awful and it's really frustrating that I was met with that instead of genuine people that cared even just a little bit."

"I’m a 21 year old student living at home (it’s cheaper and typically in my culture you don’t really leave home at all) living with my mother and father.

I have so much resentment towards my father, as he’s an alcoholic and always argues with me and my mother (especially her) over little things. 

I actually hate him, and it’s so genuine. I don’t like having this hateful feeling, but he’s done so many things that warrant it. He’s cheated on my mother for over 12 years and I’ve known since the very beginning and continues to live in this delusional that me and my mother don’t know.

He also doesn’t contribute anything towards the bills or rent at all and basically expects my mother to cover everything (bills, food and rent). He earns decent money, my mother however works at McDonalds (and you can expect what kind of salary she earns) and we barely get by. 

I’ve been trying to find a job for around 2 years now, as I feel that I need to help my mother, since my father doesn’t want to do anything. I did have a job for a short while, but he made me leave it as he said that he will start contributing, but he never did (my mistake I know). 

As a student, I obviously get a student loan and I started to help my mother around the house with new furniture (as we needed it) and he didn’t like it at all and said things like “whose gonna pay for the bills etc, if you guys don’t have any money” or “you don’t need these things, it’s not like anyone is coming over anyway”. 

I just honestly don’t know what to do, I’ve had these tendencies for while where I want to cause my father harm. He sleeps on the sofa sometimes and I just feel like putting a pillow over his face and just do it ( I know it’s wrong and I would never do it). 

I’m always upset because of him and I really want him to leave my life and to never be involved in my future. 

Ps I’ve definitely missed a lot of things about him and his general behaviour."

I have nothing to be happy about. My life consist of work home that’s it. It’s very sad and i don’t want to continue to feel this way. I don’t have a car so i can’t go anywhere. Please don’t tell me generic answers like take the bus or figure out how to get a car…i have my liscence too. Anyways I have zero social life and i wish it didn’t affect me as much. I see myself as a literal loser and it’s so hard getting out of this mindset. Also i’m on no fap hopeing that will help but it doesn’t. I really don’t want to fap though.

my family doesn’t believe in vacation or going out together, i see other families spending quality time together and i can’t help but feel jealous, sitting at home gets boring, all i hear from people around me is talk about how fun their weekend was and how many trips they have this year, meanwhile all i do is work and honestly have been feeling burned out, i don’t have friends to hang out with either, i feel like i don’t live life to the fullest and some “common sense” isn’t so common to me because i am not really exposed to much"	worstresponder2019	post	30.634801532907687	male	White	0.9985742568969727	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

"anytime i see a couple or friends talking having fun or laughing my mind immediately goes to roasting myself for not being that cool or funny or smart 

i tell my self that everyone is different, everyone has problems, and i shouldn't compare my self to anyone 


and i immediately think that no one likes me or loves me or wants to talk to me or cares about me to even have a conversation

then i get reminded of everytime that girls have replied to me with one words while i said a ton

probably because what i said wasn't that interesting. 

before anytime i talk i try to think of things to say that are interesting, cool, funny, smart but i got nothing. 

i hate being the ""Boring unlikeable nice guy who is passive or aggressive"" 

everyday i write these journals, and everyday i try to fight the negative thoughts, trying to change my people pleasing habits

for past week i been doing everything that scares the hell outta me. or makes me uncomfortable even though its to my advantage

if you look back at my every post does my problem go back to self esteem? 

comparison, people pleasing, boring personality, no friends, overthinking, desperate, needy

I think i look to have fun by getting others approval/attention. i know thats not the way.

today i told my self to not look for external validation, i need internal validation but u don't know where to look. 

i study, i work, i exercise, mediate, watch shows, listen to music, stargaze or dive deep into astronomy online, or watch documentaries, or go for walks, past 2 days i been trying to create a documentary and post it on YouTube, im learning another language and coding for college, trying to learn Muay Thai from my phone,

 because i live in iraq and finding fun classes or hobbies is hard af. im in a middle of big city right now. i even looked on google maps to find fun places to do things alone and i couldn't find any. 
only physical hobby i have is soccer but cant play because broken leg 2 months ago 


but i want to achieve something bigger or at least more fun, im tired of having porn and texting by my only goals but finding an alternative is hard especially when i been addicted to these for years. 

i deleted my social medias permanently and challenged my self to not fap or look at porn for a month to see what happens.

i know ""Self improvement"" cant be my only life goal and there needs to be some balance and have fun too or do something meaningful thats not beneficial to me in any way"	Butcher__1	post	18.48879886274257	male	White	0.9957237243652344	na	na	na	1	sad	"ethnicity: middle eastern, age: late teens to early 20s, gender: male, explanation: the author mentions residing in iraq, implying a middle eastern ethnicity. the author's writing suggests struggles typical of late teens to early 20s, such as low self-esteem, desire for validation and identifying self improvements. the author portrays himself as a male by sharing stories of interactions with girls and identifying as the ""unlikeable nice guy"". additionally, he talks about trying to learn muay thai from his phone and his broken leg from playing soccer, suggesting he is male."

"Hi everyone,
I feel like I can’t anymore with how such a lack of understanding people have. This year I let a friend who I thought was close to me get to know me on a deeper level and meet my dysfunctional family. After meeting them, my friend doesn’t really talk to me and it makes me feel like my family drama ruined our friendship. I’ve had this happen many times before where people drop me because of how it works. Granted I’m not much like my family since I’ve separated from them and see them like once a year. But it still hurts. Do people also experience this? It makes me feel like I shouldn’t be friends with people and always puts me in a deep depression."

"I feel like a shitty person. The friend that I cut off was one of my boyfriend's friends, but they were horrible to him and didn't care about him. They even decided to start dating my boyfriend's abusive ex. Anyways, since that, I've been rethinking my who friendship with them. Last night, they contacted me out of no where wanting to ""talk"". They hadn't spoken to me at all since the end of school, so this was strange. I called my boyfriend and his best friend (also one of shitty friend's exes), and told them what was going on. The shitty friend added me to a group chat with them and my boyfriend's abusive ex. They then proceeded to ask really personal questions regarding my boyfriend's time with said ex, if he mentioned any sexual assault that the ex did to my boyfriend, etc. Then they started asking about his trauma. By this time, I was done with that and my friendship. I didn't want to talk to them anymore, but my boyfriend insisted I kept going to hear what they had to say about his trauma from a child. They soon ended the conversation with an insult to my boyfriend and his last name. My boyfriend told me to send them something he typed up, so I did. Me and the shitty friend were conversating, me just asking why they wanted to do this now, and they said it was all the abusive ex's doing. He was worried about shit resurfacing with this next school year when it was already left and dropped months ago. My boyfriend texted me and said that he felt betrayed by me that I would want to be their friend, and rightfully so. I told him I was working on something to say to ditch them as a friend, and I showed it to him and then sent it.

I feel like I'm doing everything wrong and I'm caught in crossfire again and everyone hates me. I don't know what to do from here. My boyfriend went to sleep after, since he was tired and hurt, and he hasn't spoken to me, and I'm working on blocking/deleting contacts with my now ex friend. I don't know what to do to help my boyfriend through this right now. I get it if he doesn't want to talk to me, but I just want him to be okay."	luffixs_	post	25.94157260012793	female	White	0.9994586110115051	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

When I moved school after primary school I became friends with two girls in my class and they didn't like each other. My friend from primary school and I were friends with both of them. After I spent time with them as a trio they became friends and after a while we turned into a group of 4. Everything was fine for two years but then my friend (lets call her Sam) and I got into a fight. She knew I liked this boy very much and decided to flirt with him and tell him lies about me. I know we where young and I should get over it but it happened often. She always did that with the boys I like. That's why I'm not best friends with her anymore, but for the group we stayed connected. In fact I never trust her with anything anymore. Lucky for me I got closer with Jane, she was the best, we studied together, we FaceTimed everyday and we where like sisters. I helped her with one subject I was good in and we grew closer. Like normal teenager we talked about everything and spent so much time together. She knew the thing with Sam and the same happened to her. We both had enough of Sam, she used us for homework and cheated from us. Everything was fine for 6 years. We had our traditions. Every summer she would fly to her family and I only see her 2 weeks. The good thing is we messaged or FaceTimed ever single day. Sadly, like the headline says, this year was different. She stopped messaging me and never called, she only writes me when she need homework or help with school stuff. After a month I found out she does the same things with Sam, she replaced me with her. She ignored me except when she need something. I asked her what was wrong and she said that she likes to hangout with Sam. I felt betrayed in some way. I know I may be overreacting but it got worse. She started to smoke with Sam even in our 10 mins break she stands up and goes outside. When I ask her something in class she gets really mad for nothing. Our fourth friend Kim is also bothered by their mood, but she stays quiet because she like Sam so much and sometimes I ask myself what I did wrong? Kim who I knew since I was a child trusts Sam more and my best friend Jane turned into a smoker. I just feel used by them and betrayed. I know I kinda overreact but now we have holidays and Kim and Jane never messaged me once. I share this and ask you what I did wrong.

Something happened to me 4 years ago (won't go into details). Ever since then I've only ever been able to feel sadness and grief. I can't remember the last time I was genuinely happy. I look forward to crying at night bc it's the only real emotion I've been able to feel in forever. Does it get better? I've been trying to be better but when I get stuck in my thoughts it's not a pretty sight.	AmbitiousContext7234	post	32.28038995361547	male	White	0.9949888586997986	na	na	na	2	sad	no prediction.

"   I had a friend online and we liked each other. We would send pictures of cats and flowers and talk about nice stuff. Eventually, they asked if I would date them, and even though I tried to convince them otherwise, I couldn't resist saying yes. I know online relationship are silly and probably not really ""real"" relationships but at the time, I didn't think I'd ever have a chance with someone irl, and they were super nice anyway. At one point, I even turned down someone's number irl because I was happy with the way things were. Silly cat GIFs and virtual hugs were enough for me, and despite being mute for many years, I was even able to bring myself to send a few voice messages because I trusted them. Life seemed a little bit nicer for a while.

   I always responded to texts much more quickly than my friend. I always have my phone on me, and would reply as soon as I noticed they had said something. They might take a few days though, but I figured it's ok because I am just weird and clingy, and they probably get busy sometimes. Eventually, they disappeared for two whole weeks. I was sad and worried, and eventually got back into my bad habit of deleting messages out of anxiety. They came back though, and I was happy to see they were safe. We even called each other and talked to each other for the first time even though talking is scary. Things had seemed grim for a while, but it seemed everything would be ok after all.

   I was wrong ti think that though, because once again, my friend got quiet. I waited every day for them to come back and did my usual stuff like taking pictures of flowers outside to send so they would be happy when they came back. Weeks went by though, and I fell back into the trap of worrying and quickly deleting messages.  I went through a lot of emotions, and my messages varied from cat GIFs, to hoping they would get better, or even sad messages asking if they stopped loving me.

   I thought I had my answer though when I saw they had deleted their Instagram accounts. I uninstalled the app I had just for them, and then made my Discord account look deleted and made a new one. Our relationship was over. I still checked the old account each day though just in case, and on the 53rd day, this glimmer of hope came true. They said they had a breakdown and tried to delete their accounts, and had been especially suicidal lately.

   I didn't act nice and send them hugs and try to help them feel happier though. I was still bitter that they had just left, and was still paranoid after thinking of stuff like how there was probably someone else they loved that they had left me for. I fixed my account so it didn't look deleted anymore, but didn't say anything back while I tried to decide whether I was mad or happy. Once again, my choice was made though. They must have thought I had really deleted my account or that I hated them, because they unfriended me and once again disappeared.

   Now, yet again, I am wondering whether they are alive or ever coming back. It might even be my fault this time. I regret not being nice and helping my friend feel better. I had promised I would never leave them, but I broke that promise. I am hurt and sad though after all of this so I don't think I like dating people very much anyway. Maybe I'd end things even if they do come back someday. I have a lot of mental health problems too. Maybe it is just my broken BPD brain. This whole thing makes me so sad and I wanted to let this out somewhere even though it's embarrassing. I don't think anyone will actually read this giant thing though but if you do, I hope you are happy and get lots of yummy muffins."

"When I was 12 I hit my eye and I had to have quite intensive surgery in hospital. Then on the other hand, one of my friends(who I feel like I can see that he has over the past few months appeared quite a bit more anxious/unsettled) was emotionally and physically abused by a family member at a young age and it really makes me feel like I don't fucking deserve/I'm not allowed to class what I did to myself as being trauma because unlike my friend who had no control over  said family member choosing to behave in that way, whereas to an extent even though I know I was emotionally/anxiety wise unwell at the time when I hit my eye, I feel like it always will feel like something I can use now as an adult to bully myself with or to use as a reason for me to ""punish"" myself. Just stuff like my mum saying that it was really traumatic for her to have to watch me being put under general anesthesia and also another family member had a breakdown that year and we did have other shit happening that year but I feel like me hitting my eye was the cherry on the cake in terms of pushing said family members stress levels over the edge. My two reasons for being hesitant about going to see a therapist about this, is:

1: feeling like they will be pissed off/be annoyed at me because I could have completely avoided doing what I ended up doing to myself

2: feeling like even though I let myself have ""little cries"" every other day or so, that as soon as I go into a therapists room and I start talking about what happened that I'll feel really out of control emotionally, and that I won't be able to cope or come back from feeling intense emotion if I get asked to talk about what I did to myself and how it affected my family

We spoke on snapchat for the most part. One day in February he just didn't reply. I thought he was caught up in life stuff. He was having issues with his baby mom at the time. Figured he was dealing with that. Messaged him multiple times on different avenues and nothing. Got on Facebook yesterday after a 3 year hiatus and find that he ODd. Fent being the one that did it.

He’s getting bullied for dating me I can’t let this happen I tried to break up with him he said he doesn’t care that he’s getting bullied but I have to make this stop…… I’ve been pretending I hate him for awhile now it hurts a lot…… I slapped him, I think that finally convinced him it was hard…… he moved away I miss him a-lot but I have to keep up my fake happiness Wait fake? You have to fake happiness sometimes I didn’t know that…… he came back to school he scared of me though I’ll tell him it’s okay and that we can be friends again…… I moved will I ever see anyone I care about again…… we moved back I’m so glad I feel kind of dramatic and weak and pathetic oh well……I love dork he’s my boy best friend he’s so funny… and handsome… I-I have a crush on him I’m so happy I’ll tell my friends…… the whole band wants us to date including the director that’s funny…… she likes him my friend likes him too oh well I can deal she didn’t hurt me…… He’s dating her well I’ll try to stop liking him. I’ll tell everyone I don’t…… I think I don’t like him but I have no idea because I don’t understand emotions……I like him again but I’m not telling anyone! He sent me a TikTok no out of the ordinary he sends me them all the time even though a while back I confessed I don’t know how he felt I didn’t let him say his input the tik tok says your best friend wants to make out with you and the caption says we should get to iT HE LIKES ME. No there’s no way he probably just sent that because he knows I want to or to make me happy or he knows I like him and so he went for it but regretted  it I’ve done that before. I ask my friend that everyone likes she says he was flirting I ask my best friend since forever she says to ask him out he’s single and from her brain likes me she sounds like she knows something I don’t but it’s whatever I’m never gonna ask him……I will forever stay awake at night crying because while others realize their in love and smile I cry and beg god to make it stop because I know I will never get over him because I’m so pathetic and insane.I’ll forever know Love was never happy.

"I was dropped from both campaigns two weeks apart. Have been playing for almost a year too. The first one was a group I did not click with, been playing with them since january and they dropped me. I was fine with it though, since I did not click with any of them. Second one happened just Thursday. I missed a session because I went to the movie with my family instead of the session. I did get an ""Okay"" from the DM, Jesse. This morning though he told me I was out. 1.)I was not ""engaging"" enough 2.) I would space out during sessions and 3.) Because a lady was complaining about giving me rides to the session, I did pay her gas money but she still complained. The whole thing just makes me feel really sad, and my self esteem is very low now. There were other incidents from the past which I will not get into details but they all deal with a group of people or one person dropping me because they do not like me. Like I just want ONE friend group to hang with, why is that so hard? I have a good friend Bill, but he lives in Florida and I have not seen him for a decade. I do have one friend here in my city, my former coworker, he is cool to talk to but he has a fancy job and is rarely free. Not sure I want to try again with a brand new friend group, I will just get hurt again. Oh god I need a Girlfriend.

"Dude i dont want to be that guy and maybe other people have better solutions but leave her...

You are hurting no one but yourself buddy.. i was in a similar situation and in the beginning its hard but tbh now i feel way better that i let her go. You are only the shoulder to cry on for her, she is using you for emotional Support, nothing more. She doesnt care about you. Leave her, work on yourself, surround yourself wirh people who care about you.

Right now i only have 3 friends, but i can trust all of them more than anything. Find those people and leave anyone behind who doesnt fit in that description.

It happened to me as well, a classmate asked me to hang out like 2 years ago in the summer, we would go out like every 2 days and there were some other girls, colleagues or other friends of her, I was the single boy, now that I am thinking it was a bit weird but I was happy that I had people to hang out with. Then it all stopped, now I am staying all day long in the house and not going outside at all as I don't have such friends to ask me to hang out outside anymore. It's better this way I would prefer to not have friends then have fake ones. You will find better people.	Pro_baba	reply	na	na	na	0.9981264472007751	no	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.

"I am M18 years old, and I never had a girlfriend, but for about 2 years, I got close with my classmates. Two of my crushes friendzoned me. They were the only people I ever said i like them, and nothing, just we can be friends, and that's it. I felt like shit for a very long time. Because of the first girl i smacked my nose on fukcing concrete on New years while throwing up because I drank way too much. With the second, I still feel like shit talking to her because we were very close, and now we barely text each other. 
But coming to the point of the post, on this week, I am on vacation with my family in Poland, and as it is usual, other families with, well, daughters come here too. I naturally find some of them attractive and would genuinely be glad to talk to them. Now to the problem we are in Poland, let's take one particular girl, she is German, me too, but in public, and my family I talk Russian, this means she doesn't know that we can speak to each other , which on the other hand means she will in no way first approach me. This leads me to make a first step, but even thinking about it just makes me feel like shit. 
You have to know that I myself am pretty nervous sometimes, I barely talk to strangers at all, only if I have to, if I know someone, yeah, I can talk for hours but strangers give me the creeps. But this week, while going to eat in the cantina, there are moments where I just awkwardly stay around my ""crush"" waiting to get food or when we are sitting at distant tables, we awkwardly look at each other sometimes, and at those times probably the first time of my life I really got anxious tics, like I started blinking very hard and doing random stuff with my hands. I think this is because of my crippling fear of rejection, I am thinking that if either of us approaches the other, I will somehow get rejected, either because of the language barrier or because she doesn't want to. 
So all of those factors leave me to believe that either I have to stand up and approach the girl I like or just live with the fear. But neither is even imaginable for me right now. The sad part about this is that I don't know what to do and how to start tackling my problems because when physical tics are involved, I really can speak of crippling fear."

"I’m a 17-year-old teenage boy in Sri Lanka. Today, my girlfriend’s mom saw a picture of me and shouted to her that I’m looking pretty bad. I’m so dark in complexion and thin,  like a guy who uses drugs. And also, she blamed my girlfriend by telling her that people who are addicted to drugs and do bad things really look similar to my appearance.

I’m just thin and dark in complexion, but I haven’t been using any kind of drug since my childhood.

I find myself reaching out begging for someone to acknowledge my pain. I beg for someone to love me in all of my imperfections, and comfort me when I'm sad. The fact is, in a world of over 8 billion people, all with their own stories of hurt and hopelessness, no one cares. No one cares because we are on a dying planet, every one of us suffering to some extent, some of us much more than others, with the trauma - the futility and meaninglessness of our existence. When there is so much suffering, people become apathetic to others and focused on only their own hurt.	BJeanGrey	post	33.60261948460878	male	White	0.0031771513167768717	na	na	na	13	sad	failed

Hey man, or whatever you are. I'm here. I can't speak collectively for people but IM HERE. The world is sad, today's society has spun off its axis. Nobody cares about real love, kindness, modesty, growth, or art. Many things seem complicated with many sides, facets, and dimensions. I believe though that the real people dealing with real problems just need to stop. Simplify. It sucks. This all sucks. There is way less positivity being shared in a world where all many of us have is each other. But I'm here. And I try everyday. And when people are disgusting or trashy I don't return it. I don't encourage it either but I won't lower myself down to others because its easy. I will live by being kind and showing love to people despite their problems. If they have a problem with it, then I will show kindness and love to someone else who may appreciate it as I only have so much energy to give. Maybe if I keep trying to be a good person and giving my best then someone will for me one day. And if not, I simply don't mind being that person for others. This train of thought has settled my suicidal urges. I live to resow the kindness and respect that has wilted on this pasture of society. And if I die doing so, then it's alright! Because it's still better than killing myself over life's bad luck.	BJeanGrey	reply	na	na	na	0.0031771513167768717	weak	strong	no	na	sad	failed

It has been 3 days, and I have slept for a total of 6 in total. Everything is so stressful already. School, family, friendships. I swear, I close my eyes but I keep thinking about so many things, and then, after 1 hours, there's this irresistible urge of using my phone,  and then, after that, thoughts starts flooding in my brain, I keep scrolling through social media, then I remember something that upset me earlier, and I try to send the person a message talking about it thinking that she can respond in the morning, but then my tired brain starts to not let me send it, because what if she wakes up bc of the notification? Then, at around 4am I pass out of exhaustion and need to wake up at 6 and start everything again.

I have felt little to no control over my life, for my entire life. It doesn't matter what I do to try to make my life better, my life never gets better. I'm exhausted, lonely and in pain all of the time. It's hopeless, nothing will ever be better. I should have the right to control my death. I want to control the last few weeks of my life and my death. The only help I need is help with a painless and dignified way to control my death. I don't belong anywhere. It is cruel to force me to continue living like this. No one is going to care when I die. There's no reason for me to continue living.

"In two minds to be honest. Because I feel like the more I force myself to always cover my arms by wearing a jacket even if it's hot weather outside but also just in general, I feel like the more I try to cover my arms the more uncomfortable(both physically literally if the weather is hot but also in an emotional sense) and more depressed I'm likely to feel about my scars. But then on the other hand and I do have anxiety so idk if I'm just imagining or overthinking, but there's been times when I've been at my groups or out and about, and someone has walked past or near me and it has genuinely felt like they have seen my scars or appeared sad.i feel like when I've been so anxious/upset all I've felt about is how low I've felt and I feel selfish because it makes me feel like I forgot that most human beings with some level of empathy will actually probably feel a bit sad/upset or concerned seeing scars from where someone has hurt themselves.

I mean it is what it is, you were in a bad situation and that's what you felt is good to do, but I hope you are now better and those are habits of the past. If someone doesn't feel right seeing your scars is their problems the fact that the wounds are healing means you got on a better path and is very good. I hope you are doing well.	gorgeousgoldfish	reply	na	na	na	0.9869102835655212	weak	no	no	na	sad	failed

I just feel numb. I have no motivation to do anything. It’s like 6 am and I haven’t slept. I haven’t done anything for a couple of days. I’m not sure what is wrong but the only way a can describe it is numb like nothing is real, nothing is actually happening. I can’t seem to do anything. The only thing I can do is look up at my ceiling. I’ve tried listening to music, going on a walk, talking about it, etc. I’m not sure what’s wrong with me but I really don’t like it.

I've felt this way too, but it has to do with what was going on in my life.  I felt incredibly unfulfilled. How do you feel now? Tell me, in your brain,  what would the perfect you be doing? Or basically what do you think you should be doing,  either internally or through social pressure. I think allot of our self value is denoted by our surroundings, and if our life is sub paylr to what we imagined, it's like replaying parts of a video game we've done 20 times before.

"My plan is to sell everything I own, and leave my job with enough money for me to do some things that I want to do before I die. 

I want to see the aurora borealis and explore the forests in Alaska. I want to spend a few nights in a tree house in the middle of the forest listening to the rain. I want to see Mogwai in concert again. I want to go to Paris again and sit at the graves of Simone de Beauvoir and Jean Paul Sartre. I want to take a train across the country, riding in my own private room. 

Then, I'm going to donate a kidney. I imagine they will give me some really good painkillers after the surgery. I will OD on the painkillers.

This is a real person btw: If you add a little bit of activity each day, dont go too fast, you will feel better, l like too run. Be proud of what u accomplish not mad at what u didn't. Life is too short for depression or anything else to consume ur life, u might be viewing life in a negative way, u wont fond happiness by doing that. Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, dont listen to a doctors diagnose unless its proving to assist you, u can still talk to a therapist tho. Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible. Look up Bobby price guy health. U can’t end ur only life which is all u know by ending ur life. Don’t think mood swings last forever. Look for the smaller thrills and the bigger ones will come. If feeling hopeless u need to add more to ur life.

"My friend and I have been chatting online for several months now. Initially, we had a platonic friendship, but we flirt with each other quite a bit now. Yesterday, I finally asked him if he wanted to be Instagram friends. He said yes. He didn’t have any pictures of himself on his Instagram (he said he’s really insecure about his appearance), but he saw my pictures. He told me that I had a lot of beautiful pictures on my profile (these pictures all have me in them, at least to some degree). 

He still messages me, but he seems more distant. Yesterday we texted until it was past midnight for me. I didn’t respond for forty minutes, and then he texted me “goodnight (my name)!” This morning, I texted him, and asked him what he was up to. He told me he was coming home from the city, and that he’d be at home in an hour and a half. He texted me and told me that he had to go to work early tomorrow, so he was going to go to sleep.

Edit: he texted me “good morning”. I replied, and he asked me how my day was. I told him, and asked him how his day was going. He told me that he missed the train and he had to take his bike to work. It’s been almost an hour, and he hasn’t texted me back. He always texts me back"	Educational-Let-1027	post	34.0994548531949	male	White	0.021672794595360756	na	na	na	3	sad	failed

The imagination often fills in the gap when you don't have all the info, and often those stories can be much more negative than the reality. It sounds like your friend appreciates you and enjoys your company!! He even complimented your photos, which suggests that he likes the way you look! He may just be tired from biking, which has changed his communication pattern today! As somebody who made most of my adult friends outside of college online, I can say, when you care for/love somebody, then they seem a lot more attractive to you because of your emotional investment... I've never ever cared about someone online, then saw what they looked like, and then thought they were hideous! ;P Its fine to express your feelings and ask for clarification, you're just taking care of your own emotional well-being by asking him what's up!

But he might be scared that you will stop talking to him if you see him. Some women can be really cold that way. He gets to know you and you got to know him. He might be scared as soon as you see him you will stop talking to him so maybe he will jump to the wrong conclusion and decide to say nothing. I get it I've been there before myself.

"I (F20) have been feeling really weird recently. 
For context I recently moved back in with my parents (it was a really toxic household at times which is the reason I left). I moved out at 18 and moved back in at 20. 
Since I’ve been back everything has been fine with my parents, they haven’t been fighting with each other or me. 
Despite of everything being fine, I still feel like I’ve reverted back to my depressed 17 year old self. 
I feel like I’m fighting a losing battle trying to stay on top of everything. I feel so sad sometimes, and so hopeless.
I don’t understand how I got this way again. I became the best version of myself. I was going to the gym consistently, working a lot, staying on top of all of my schoolwork & not only that, but I excelled in all of my classes. 
I don’t do half of that anymore, and I feel more overwhelmed than ever. 
I feel like this is starting to also affect my relationship. I’ve been more moody, and I dont know how I can talk to him about this. I don’t think he would understand, but I mainly feel that way because I don’t quite understand myself. 
I haven’t been able to talk to anyone in my life about the way I feel. I feel so out of touch & disconnected with myself."	Mission_Tomorrow_928	post	16.58812477181759	male	White	0.9984132051467896	na	na	na	3	sad	failed

"I'm sorry to hear you've been feeling so out of sorts... I'm sure the stress of moving back to an older environment is hard to handle and can trigger old behaviors/feelings. It's just a perceived setback though and it doesn't change the progress you've actually made at all!! 

I have felt like that a time or two in life myself. I was a passenger in a bad car wreck in my mid 20s and had to move back in with parents who cared for me while I healed up, and yes, it made me feel like a troubled teenager all over again! :P Sometimes, it would help me to sit back and think about what I would do if I had unlimited resources, time, money & how I would structure my life to be as happy and fulfilled as possible... basically, picturing what my ""perfect life"" would look like. And then, out of the daydream, there would be a few things I could actually focus on in real life. Or even, just understanding where I wanted to be vs. where I was. And if nothing makes you feel happy or content while imagining, it might be time to call in the professional for some help getting back to equilibrium. And, if there's anyway you can feel motivated to do so, it might help to try and reinstate some of the habits that you were proud of before, like exercising or focusing on schoolwork - since they can help with your internal sense of well being! You can start as small as you like and just build up doing this and that until you're coasting along again! And if you can talk to your partner, I'd encourage you to do so, as I'm sure he'll want to support you even if he can't fully understand all you're going through.  


Be kind to yourself and I hope you get to understand what's the matter and feel better soon! Sending the best thoughts your way!"	Mission_Tomorrow_928	reply	na	na	na	0.9984132051467896	strong	no	no	na	sad	failed
"Thank you! 
I honestly really needed to hear a lot of what you just told me. 
I think I can just be a little hard on myself, just like everyone else is. 
I mentioned a couple things to my partner about how I felt, he didn’t understand it but he was supportive. 
I’ll probably just go seek some professional help before it gets worse.

"So, I met this girl through mutual friends. She was awesome. Really into each other. She HIGHLY insinuated she wanted something serious.
Example:

“Thank you for the night. I want to talk about goals with you. Like morals and values.

I don’t want to push you into something you don’t want.

Sorry if I’m coming off as pushy I just want us to be on the same page”

We got like “romantic” pictures together and after she nudges me on the arm and I believed she said “so, is there anything you want to ask me?”


She starts coming over my place. And we hookup and watch movies when that happens.

Then she goes on vacation with her family. Drunk texts me “hey I think you’re really great but honestly I don’t see it going anywhere..”

I asked her why she felt that way. She said
“Stress, family problems, work and mental health issues”

So, I backed off. Then she starts messaging and calling like nothing happened.. I bring it up and we get things cleared.

We go out again and she’s all excited to see me and shit and pushes for more time together.

She stops messaging me as much. So i do as well. She comes over my place for a movie. Has a full blown breakdown. About her mother, her jobs (working 70 hours per week), her exes, then says she’s a bad person. 

I was really taken back. Next day rushes out the door. Says she wants to see me sooner than usual. Later texts me “thank you for looking out for me.”

Day comes. Cancels starts sending 1 word responses. So, I back off. Since I backed off, she start putting in a little more effort. But I don’t respond as much. Don’t text her all day until she kept sending “ :( “
Yet never tells me what’s wrong.

I told her she been seeming pretty distant lately. So, I ask her what’s wrong and all. And our friends kept asking why aren’t we together yet? So I bring it up and 
 Eventually, she messages me “I don’t want to pursue a relationship. I’m sorry”

Me: “okay. Thank you for letting me know.”
Her: “how do you feel about Friday?”
Me: “sure”

I didn’t really know what to say. I felt like that should’ve been an in person conversation. That’s really shitty of her. But I feel like I want her side of the story so I can improve as a person if I messed up anywhere. I kinda feel like I want to end it. I like her a lot but can’t stand how I’m now being treated. I want to just set boundaries. With her saying “no one ever treated me like this.” And flirty and all this shit
Then does that. 

Our mutual friend texted her a few days before that happened. He showed me their messages. She apparently brought me up in conversation. He asked how everything was between us and she said “things are good! We went to the parks last week” (Disney)

Him: is it safe to say you all are bf and gf
Her: no
Him: How come?
Her: why would we be?
Him: idk just figured you’d be happy in a relationship I guess.
Her: lmao maybe
Him: just wanted to make sure you’re alright. Both of you are my friends.
Her: I’m alright, thank you.

Generally if it is just anxiety and depression you are either flat ( the same as everyone else ) or you are depressed low.

Why do i feel like im living a life full of lies? Forcing a smiles and laughter eventho my heart is hurting. Whenever i see a friend sad, ill always be there to console them. But when is my turn to be consoled? Well it’s probably my fault to begin with. How can i show my friends or the people around me my vulnerable side. I can’t.  I’m also in the army, I can’t be showing my comrades that I’m weak. Nothing ever goes the way i want it to be. It’s exhausting. I just wanna be free from this feeling.

I feel the same way. I think I find things that will give me happiness. And it’s gone. I don’t go around as a “sad sack” or with depressing stories. I’m outgoing, friendly, love to make people laugh. But inside all I want to do is cease existing. It feels like I’m being pulled in 10 different directions. All I want to do is rip my skin off. I don’t want to be me anymore. I’m so fuckin tired. All the time. I pop xans and take double shots before and during work. I go until I throw up. I’ve had appointments to see my therapist. All got canceled. I’m trying. Fuckin trying. And it seems like it’s just out of fingertips reach. It’s there. The light. Oxygen. Bliss even, maybe. And I can just lightly feel it’s brush. It’s like you’re running out of air and only your nostrils are above water. All the time. I scream internally all the time. “Either fuckin drown dude or get the fuck up!” There’s something in me that knows I can get better. But I can’t accept it. You’re going to be ok, Powder. You took the time to write this out. I took the time to read it. Right now we’re not alone. And I think we can take a little solace in that. I care about you. I don’t know you. But I care.

This is a real person btw: If you add a little bit of activity each day, dont go too fast, you will feel better, l like too run. Be proud of what u accomplish not mad at what u didn't. Life is too short for depression or anything else to consume ur life, u might be viewing life in a negative way, u wont fond happiness by doing that. Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, u can still talk to a therapist tho. Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible. Look up Bobby price guy health. U can’t end ur only life which is all u know by ending ur life. Don’t think mood swings last forever. Look for small thrills and the bigger ones will  come. Look up how to deal with Loneliness by dry creek ranger school. Suicide is a permanent fix to a temporary problem. U never need family, friends, a significant other, but you always need urself. Throw away the drugs, and if u feel tempted run past ur car or any gateway to them. U got this, if u fall get back up.	PowderChowder31	reply	na	na	na	0.9980484247207642	weak	no	no	na	sad	failed

" r/sadposting r/sad r/joker I'm fifteen and The Society so far that I live in reminds me just like one Arthur lives in. People i've called/considered friends have hurt me in ways unimaginable, such as them making fun of my dead dad, physically assaulting me, and simply ignoring me and not caring about anyone else but themselves. I've just finished middle school, and the last week of school was my most favorite week of all. The week when school middle school ended, not because it meant summer vacation, but it meant i would never see any of the faces that hurt ever again as I know they they're all not going to the same High School I am. 

The last day of the week was the worst day of them all, as I wound up leaving school after first period, with tears streaming down my face as that day was the breaking point because my ""friends"" would not stop bothering me, and making fun of me. After I left i hopped in the car and the song 'Let it be' was playing, and hearing that made me cry harder and harder the more i listened to it. 

Throughout middle school things got progressively worse by each grade that went by, Grade 6 wasn't too bad, Grade 7 came around and hit me hard with my friend who was my best one at the time, stabbed me in the back. Grade 8.. I Felt like everyone i had met immediately disliked me and left me feeling lonely and isolated even in a full classroom. This was the year everything went downhill for me as I've made 2 new friends who seemed really nice. 

Throughout the year they bullied me and bullied me and bullied me as well as the friend i had made in grade 7. This year i explored new feelings of love, as i had fallen in love with a girl who was really nice to me and seemed like a good friend, (after watching this video i now realize that, just like Arthur, hadn't fallen in love the sophie, but the idea of it, and was shocked by her being so nice, like me who hadn't realized it at the time.)  So, we talked for a while on snapchat and then my friends i had made this year did something, i will never forgive them for,. 

During math class they'd written a love letter claiming to be me and gave it to her, the letter contained words and sentences that i couldn't imagine doing, It said that I wanted to try on her pants and i liked to stare at her butt, obviously not butt, like A$$. This sent me into a deep feeling of hatred towards them, and it only got worse from there. For the rest of the year she had me blocked and never spoke to me again, even in person, i called her name wanting to talk to her and she just ignored me, and kept walking, all because of one fake letter.. the possible happy future, ruined.. 

  Now onto the saddest part in my opinion.. My Uncle and Aunt. It was their house i took my first steps. Not mine, theirs. In their house, as an infant. From that point on I,had an extremely happy and healthy relationship with them for the better part of my life, (14 years), and four months ago, after everything, they decided sell their house and move 45 minutes away without even telling me. My Mother had to tell me that, and she did I immediately burst into tears realizing the only real place where i've felt genuine happiness, was gone..

   After that i had gone into deep and dark depression, that left me with feelings of loneliness, emptiness and anger.  That was the turning point. But this feeling of loneliness, emptiness, and anger combined into one started all the way back in elementary school, grade 2 or 3 i don't remember. I dont even remember why, i guess i just blocked it out of my memory because it was so negatively impactful towards me. Elementary school was 6 whole years of mental torture that i was enduring at such a young age. 

During elementary school I'd noticed that more and more kids were ignoring me the more I tried to talk to them. I don't know why but it brings tears to my eyes trying not to remember it.. I once again felt lonely and empty and i was left with the feeling that everyone hates me and that i somehow deserve this, even though i know i don't, it just feels that way.. I don't feel genuinely happy anymore, unless i have to fake it. To blend in with society. And I don't genuinely smile anymore, unless i have to fake it. To blend in with society.   

""No one knows what it's like to be the other guy, if I was laying on the ground bloodied and broken you'd walk right over me."" I've said that to many people and friends who'd hurt me during middle school and essentially life so far. And they just shrug it off, or if i was texting it to them, the skull emoji. I hate that emoji. 

I'm very excited for High School, as I get the gut feeling that it will be quite the change in my life that i've been pleading for, begging for.. (TLDR: My life so far has been a roller coaster of pain and suffering at the hands of society), and to everyone else, i'm to blame.. ""You should've told somebody!"" ""Why didn't you tell me?"" ""It's your fault, you're the bully""..

 To anyone who actually took the time to read this, I thank you from whatever's left in my heart i can use, And i hope that your life is better than mine because no fifteen year old, or anyone for that matter, should have to go through this pain, and endure it, and compress your feelings into a giant ball that can explode at anytime, anywhere. Thank you. "	Vegetable-Bedroom265	post	16.5309626444632	female	White	0.9426159262657166	na	na	na	2	sad	failed

I’ve checked your post history and you very clearly have some sort of insecurity around gender, along with struggling with misogyny within your society. Your appearance doesn’t hold any value over your true self, I can promise you that. Regardless of what people say, it will never define who you really are. I can also guarantee that you’re probably not ugly like you think, mental illness like this often alters our perceptions of ourselves and others. You killing yourself is not the escape you think it is. You’re throwing away an entire lifetime of opportunities because you’re really struggling with these problems. There’s so much you’re losing by doing something like this. I urge you to speak to a professional immediately, call a crisis line, a clinic, a hospital, or a clinician directly. This is going to cause so much pain and guilt towards others and yourself, you will have fear and regret almost immediately if you start whatever attempt method. There is no 100% way to guarantee death from an attempt, especially in a painless manner. It can also injure you. Please please seek help, the world doesn’t have to feel this agonizingly intolerable. I know how it feels for things to be so awful overarchingly so, but there’s still hope there, even if you can’t see it, I can promise you that.	flowery9777	reply	na	na	na	0.999496340751648	weak	no	no	na	sad	failed

"My dog a idiopathic epilepsy. He was diagnosed earlier this year and prescribed medication for it. But for some reason he's been resistant to the medication even at its highest dose. He's still having seizures and they're getting more frequent.

My mom can't afford the medication and doesn't want to make him suffer through side effects that could be painful or decrease his enjoyment of life. 

So she's going to get him put down tomorrow. And it sucks. A lot. I love my dog. I don't want to lose him when there could be another way to help him.

Everything sucks right now and I really don't know if I can forgive her for making this decision without even trying the other medication. 

And I know I should be using this last few hours with him hugging him and stuff, but I can't look at him without crying. It's too hard to breathe thinking about never seeing him again. 

I have no one else to talk to about this..."	huskmimic	post	24.54198577780739	female	White	0.9990088939666748	na	na	na	6	sad	no prediction.

Spend as much time as you can with him, even if it’s painful. I’m sorry about this situation, but it sounds like this is the only available option, and that it was around his time anyway.

It will be a long process and you will miss your dog for a long time but it slowly gets better. The day we put him down it was early in the morning. I got home, showered, and just watched feel good movies all day. 

Take photos!!! Videos, etc. And see if the vet does any paw/nose prints. If so take them. If they charge you can do it yourself at home."	huskmimic	reply	na	na	na	0.9990088939666748	strong	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.

I don’t owe as much as a lot of people, like it could be worse. I owe about 4k in credit card debt. It’s not shopping sprees and fast food, it’s actually all school debt and groceries over the past 3 years. I graduated in 2020 and my parents were divorcing at the time, i didn’t qualify for FAFSa because of my mothers income despite the fact that I no longer lived with her nor my dad. My senior year got cut short thanks to covid and we didn’t go over student grants and loans. I didn’t even go to the uni that I got into and really wanted to go to and ended up settling for a community thanks to my financial situation. I job hopped a lot back then because idk i was going through sumn. I’ve been trying to find a job as a server somewhere so I can make the utter most money and pay this debt off before the end of the year. I’m struggling out here. It’s gonna be hard working and going to school this fall. I just need to get myself out of this debt hole. When I do I’ll feel so much better about myself and where my life is heading. I finally qualify for fafsa AND EBT  now but unfortunately they won’t pay me back what i’ve already payed. I really hope that by the beginning of next year, i’d have payed off this debt so i can feel brand new again.	poopsicleassburger	post	16.612982534901832	female	White	0.9955986738204956	na	na	na	2	sad	failed

"I share your sentiments. I feel so alone in every single way. Every choice I make seems to be the road less travelled.

I have a side gig publishing books, and it seems as if I fit into the smallest niche market, making my ability to generate sales at trade shows such an uphill slog compared to other people.

I did a test, and it seems in my country, there are about 12 (literally 12) in the entire country with my thinking pattern. I always think differently. And people always tell you the world needs people who think differently. They shout it! But when you voice your ideas, you get weird sidelong glances, and you're looked at as weird. The world might need people who think differently, but they don't want them, nor do they treat them with respect.

In my day job, my thinking pattern doesn't fit in with the rest of the world. People who are younger and newer in my field are being promoted ahead of me because I think different. I have learning disabilities that scramble information before I'm able to put it in long-term memory, which makes learning almost impossible. I'm always outpaced, and I feel embarrassed. I make so many mistakes. I need to take a nap at lunch because I'm so mentally exhausted at what normal people are so good at. I'm exhausted again by midafternoon and can't finish the day.

I've given up as well. I'm basically just skating by now, but what's the point in trying anymore?

I know this sounds like a vent, and it is. I can't offer any help, but I just want you to know you're not alone. It might suck, and it might not get better, but I'm right here with you.

So last week was my birthday. I turned 24 and I came to realize that I'm now older than my father who passed before I was born. Minor setback, I mean, I didn't know him so I shouldn't be that sad about it, right? Well a couple of days later, my dog was acting strange so I took her to the vet. Breast cancer. BREAST CANCER. Oh and can't really help unless I make her even more weak with all of the chemo, because it's already spread. So I might wake up to my best friend of 10 years dying. I don't wanna leave her side and I don't wanna see her in pain so it sucks. So to put a cherry on top of my shit show, my mother gets put into the hospital for falling, and because I wouldn't see her right away, because I was watching my dog, she decides to try to OD on blood sugar meds. Now she's going to a rehab facility where I might not see her for like months or maybe even a year. I don't know, last time she tried to pull this I was 12 and I didn't see her again until I was 14.	ladybug61699	post	24.053620557459546	female	White	0.9986655712127686	na	na	na	1	sad	failed

"Plz be as honest as you like. I know anxiety and other mental health is so common now(to the point where i often feel like the truth is that everyone has shit mental health, it's just that some people are better at pretending that it isn't an issue or are just better at dealing with it) to the point where I feel like generally if someone can't have any empathy at all for anxiety/mental health, then for a lot of people I feel like that would be a turn off. But at the same time, when people say ""going to your doctor/GP for mental health help is exactly the same as going to your doctor/gp for physical health"" I feel like it's a bit unfair to say that because to me I don't think it does feel as ""easy"" or as simple(much more fear of being judged or the conversation feeling awkward)

A specialist is there to listen and is not going to judge you, the conversation needs to be awkward so you are going to say everything you have in your heart and in your mind so the doctor knows how to help. I am not going to vote as I don't like the options and I don't quite understand the question but don't be scared to ask for help, go to your parents, go to your friends go to a doctor, just go to someone and ask help if you want I can listen and I will try to help you to get back on track just ask.	gorgeousgoldfish	reply	na	na	na	0.006641282234340906	weak	no	no	na	sad	failed
Hi. I've been lonely as long as i can remember. I've made mental health improvements by being open to myself and it just somewhat hit me a few days ago that i should change my identity into someonelse who doesn't want love and just fights for glory lol. It did help, its been helping me feel more positive and functioning but the same exact hurt feelings come up at times. Specially when im tired and i just think to myself that this loneliness is just unbeatable. I really don't want to feel this screwed draining hurt feelings coming up and eating my energy. But to fix that i need to feel loved which i dont xd. So giess im just fucked.	uknownuser4949	post	27.476571949867935	female	White	0.9956954717636108	na	na	na	3	sad	failed

"My relationship of two years ended and I'm just struggling.

Nothing really special here. Just a generic break up story I suppose. I (21m) was dating my last partner (21f) for 2 years and some change. Everything was great up until two days ago when we got some ice cream. I began to push and push in something pointless and she freaked and stressed and eventually told me she feels like it would be the better option for us to separate as she's afraid I was being held back by her. This greatly confused me as I didn't feel that way at all, in fact I felt she pushed me out of my comfort zone. She wanted to be normal to see if everything worked out and it was just a weird feeling but unfortunately it was not. She told me yesterday that simply put she loves me so much and believes I provided her a safe space and such, but my negativity was simply too much. To clarify and not hide any details from anyone here I am extremely negative. I complain all the time about things and I frankly don't know why I'm such an ass about things I don't like in the moment. She had felt that way for a while but was too scared to tell me because she didn't know how I'd take it. I'm not sure how long she felt that way but I had no idea until she broke up with me officially. I'm struggling because I genuinely regret that I was so bad at times and want nothing more than to undo it, though I understand I can't. I'm also hurting alot because I did ask her quite often how she felt about me and if I was being too much. She would always simply say yes and even comment on my progress. I want to blame myself and her but nobody at the same time. She had mentioned that she couldn't give me another chance because of a few things. Our dreams are too different, ex: she wants big wedding and I'd want a small one. Now marriage wasn't a serious discussion just fun to think about. I just speak so passionately and negatively I guess I created the image that I was dead set on that and that's a huge regret of mine. I wish I didn't portray a version of myself that isn't true. The other reason she couldn't give me a chance was simply that even if she believes I want to change and will she doesn't want to be around Incase I get angry again. I never hit her or anything like that. I would simply just complain so much that it weighed down on her and it got to her limit. She said that there is a chance that after some time we can be together again if things are different for both of us. I unfortunately am just going to take that as it's not going to happen and it's over. I wish I didn't do what I did but I'm looking forward to bettering myself regardless. I just am so scared to deal with it and honestly I'm not sure how I will. I just know I need to.

This is a real person btw: If you add a little bit of activity each day, dont go too fast, you will feel better, l like too run. Be proud of what u accomplish not mad at what u didn't. Life is too short for depression or anything else to consume ur life, u might be viewing life in a negative way, u wont fond happiness by doing that. Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, u can still talk to a therapist tho. Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible. Look up Bobby price guy health. U can’t end ur only life which is all u know by ending ur life. Don’t think mood swings last forever. Look for small thrills and the bigger ones will  come. Look up how to deal with Loneliness by dry creek ranger school. Suicide is a permanent fix to a temporary problem. U never need family, friends, a significant other, but u always need urself. Don't chase her, be grateful for what u have and try to progress in anger management.	imjustsadandconfused	reply	na	na	na	0.9980241060256958	weak	no	no	na	sad	failed

I got dumped 5 days ago, from a 7 month relationship, my longest relationship so far (I’m 16, he’s 17). 

It was so perfect, we had the same humor, we understood each other, I’ve never felt so loved and safe. I gave him everything, our first times together, I showed him as much affection as I could, made sure he wouldn’t ever doubt my love for him. 

All it took was 6 days for him to decide he wanted to dump me, he said it through a call, I played it cool like I didn’t care, but I was broken, I felt so betrayed. We were in a stable relationship, I can’t believe it only took him 6 days to decide we weren’t right for each other, although I also thought about breaking up months ago, I still hoped we would work through anything if we communicated, I told him all my feelings, but he didn’t even communicate his feelings before he broke up with me. Out of no where, did he ever even love me, just a week ago hanging out we got into a small argument but I thought it was just a hiccup, did he stop loving me since then. How could he do this when we made so much plans, I never loved someone so much, it hurts to much. 

Acting like I didn’t care hurted, should I have shown I care, I was so hurt and caught by surprised, would this had changed anything?"		post	20.402176761568853	female	White	0.9994699358940125	na	na	na	20	sad	failed

"This is the learning time of your life. It can be hurtful as you well know, it can also teach you important life lessons. 

Not until you are about 25 are you really ready to decide what kind of person you want to spend your life with. When we are younger, we can be attracted to all kinds of things that end up being destructive. I married an alcoholic at age 21 (long distance, he’d hidden it) - a huge mistake.  

The fact that he’s dumped you means that for whatever reason, it means he wants to have other options. It may have very little to do with you as a person, maybe he wants to explore the other fish in the sea.

"I can’t even imagine how shitty, broken, betrayed, useless and insecure you must feel right now, but I feel your pain, I truly do. Everyone will say you’re better off without him, that this is a lesson, you must take it and move on. The thing is they’re right in their own way, it’s just that your mind right now is in a state incapable of processing it — and it’s okay, it’s totally normal. 

Remember that you were in this relationship for YOU, not just for him. Now that he hurt you and left you, there’s no one who can help YOU deal with the pain better than yourself. What do you want right now? What do you need? Focus on these things, treat yourself like you would treat a friend in this situation. 

It all sounds corny and cheesy, I know. My wife of six years also took six days to dump me for another guy, and it was just a couple weeks ago, so right now I’m going through the exact same process.

The best advice I was given was this. My gf of a month and a half broke up with me via text when I was at a college orientation. I really just died inside. Allow yourself to hurt and feel emotions for a couple days. But then you need to hit the ground running and not look back. If you believe you treated him nicely then that’s all you could do and some people do not understand how much you did for them until months later. Eventually and not saying it will happen is you will hit a point where they are so far behind in your head that when the reach out you will feel no need to even talk to them. Be excited for life. You are young and have so much love to give new people. Life can’t consist of being in a constant state with 1 person because you can miss out on expierences with others.

It is not impossible but so hard to find the true person at that early stage of life. Relationships start, over may even go more than you think so but don't worry.

you will break up and be broken up with for very very strange reasons from the ages of 16-23 or so, it’s a learning time in life, sometimes things just aren’t what they seem.

Thank you, this is very reassuring, I feel like this whole breakup is taking a big toll on my self worth and confidence, and although I still miss him I’ve processed that we probably didn’t have as perfect of a relationship as I remembered if he was able to dump me this fast, I’m still sour though that maybe it was my fault or he just found a prettier girl.		follow-up	na	na	na	0.9994699358940125	strong	strong	no	na	sad	failed
No problem! I would not be too sour if you think it is your fault or if he found a prettier girl. I think you are perfectly fine and do not need to worry to hard about that.

This is a real person btw: If you add a little bit of activity each day, dont go too fast, you will feel better, l like too run. Be proud of what u accomplish not mad at what u didn't. Life is too short for depression or anything else to consume ur life, u might be viewing life in a negative way, u wont fond happiness by doing that. Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend.Look up Bobby price guy health. Don’t think mood swings last forever. Look for small thrills and the bigger ones will  come. Look up how to deal with Loneliness by dry creek ranger school. U have to be content with your accomplishments before u move on to the next.

So basically yesterday it was a normal day I was packing up my Guinea pigs packed up the cage pieces I had them separated because I couldn't afford to get my boy neutered yet I had them chilling on my bed waiting about thirty minutes to leave it was hot but I had the fan on and a window was open my mom told me to come downstairs because we we're about to leave and I got both of my guineas and I noticed my girl guinea pig pumpkin wasn't moving I instantly started panicking because I could tell she wasn't sleeping she was twitching and I instantly texted my mom she ran upstairs and she said maybe she just needed some air so we sat her outside I was crying so much because I blamed myself I thought somehow I was the cause of her having a heart attack but pumpkin was already like three years old I believe i don't think that's old but she was acting funny few days before it happened and I regret not doing anything when I noticed something was off and when I came outside to check on her she was gone her cute pink ears wasn't pink anymore it broke my heart I almost had a panic attack I mean that's how much I love my pets I don't have children yet but I considered my guineas to be my children I don't know if I should instantly get my boy Guinea a new play mate or should I wait because he has been sulking and not really happy since yesterday. Any advice? RIP pumpkin🤍🖤🤎	Distinct-Grape2497	post	20.11207070499957	female	White	0.9961410164833069	na	na	na	3	sad	failed

First, I’m sorry for your loss :( that’s very unfortunate.. I lost one of mine a few months ago and it was definitely sad but yk, things happen and I’m really sorry that happened. I know Guinea pigs can get lonely so maybe consider getting the boy a playmate? I didn’t get mine another, but she seems to be doing fine on her own. It really depends on the Guinea pig tho, so definitely think about getting him a friend :) something I noticed was my Guinea pig ate a little less and was a little less herself so I think she was mourning a bit. So you’re pig might mourn as well. It’s been about 4 months and my pig is thriving now :) Definitely make sure to spend time with your Guinea pig to make sure he doesn’t get lonely, but it gets better 🩷	Distinct-Grape2497	reply	na	na	na	0.9961410164833069	strong	strong	no	na	sad	failed

"(TW: suicidal thoughts) 

Hi everyone. I don’t even really know how to start this. 

I never planned to make it as far in my life as I did. I’m almost 25, I didn’t think I would be here past 21, at the latest. My whole life I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety. I’ve never gotten help beyond a few therapy sessions. I come across as someone who is really put together, outgoing and genuine. I have friends, I have an incredible best friend, and a loving family. I objectively have a good life. 

I’m in my last year of my masters, and I’m realizing the only reason I did a masters degree is because I didn’t know what else to do. I now am in $80,000 of debt. I have no idea what line of work I want to be in, because everything I think I would like, you need an entire other degree for, and I only recently realized the fields I want to be in. The idea of a monthly student debt payment, rent, groceries, car bills, it seems so impossible for me to ever be able to pay off and juggle everything. 

I feel like I’ve never served a purpose for anyone in their life. I feel like no one would miss me. I just feel like a bad person. I’ve been so deeply sad for so long that it feels numb. Not a day goes by that I don’t think about killing myself, and it’s been like that for years. I’m scared my best friend will realize they deserve someone better, because basically anyone would be better than me. I feel so lonely, and I feel guilty over feeling lonely. 

I think I’ve always felt this impending sense of doom, and every day is harder than the last. I wake up, have a full breakdown every morning, and then go to work, come home and have another complete breakdown. I live at home with my family, work retail, and my best friend lives seven hours away from me. I love my best friend more than anything in this world. I don’t know how I got so lucky to have them in my life. They’re absolutely brilliant, smart, and such an incredible friend. But I also am so lost. I’m hopeless, and suicide seems to be the only way out of how I’m feeling. 

It just feels like no one understands how badly I feel. That’s partially my fault because I’m not great at expressing that, but the few times I’ve tried with family members, it didn’t go well. I don’t want to worry my best friend and burden them with how I’m feeling, so they don’t really know either. 

I’m just putting this out there and wondering if anyone else has ever felt similar? If anyone ever attempted, and then things got better after it failed? I’m just at a loss, I feel hopeless, and that my life is a waste. That maybe everyone would be better off without me, and that this is the only answer to escape how bad I’m feeling."

"This is a really sensitive subject and i""m not really sure what to say, but i also in the past have felt feelings of not being worthy of my friends time. Over time I can to realize that it doesn't really matter or not if you're ""worthy"" or not. My friend didn't look at it that way. All that mattered is if generally we enjoyed being in each others presence, which clearly you're friend does since you're still friends with them. 

And if they're you're best friend, I'm gonna assume they want the best for you as well, so I'm sure as hell they would be willing to share your burden. What else are friends for?

Basically you need to throw out the window the thought of not deserving them, not because that's an invalid thought, but because in the end your friend wouldn't care about that and both of ARE equals in your relationship. Even if it doesn't feel that way. And they would certainly miss you if you just went ""POOF!"".

Sharing the burden makes it lighter. You need to find the strength to do this. (and therapy, but a good therapist may be hard to find. they exist. you just didn't luck out on that. keep looking)

One thing i would suggest is to write it in a letter. It would help to formulate your thoughts, and express it in the most understandable way possible. You could write and tweak it until you feel it's sufficient, rather than trying to express it verbally and getting stuck. (Though do make sure not to stuff it in a drawer and forget about it.)

&#x200B;

Oh and by the way, if you say you have a loving family, then they would also definitely miss you. And care about you. Your presence may be small, but it does have at least a little impact on the world. You just may not see it. 

&#x200B;

P.S. Hopefully what I wrote helps and doesn't make your depression worse.

And here is a nice song by the way. Take a listen.

if i took 20 tablets of midol (500 mg of acetaminophen, 60 mg of caffeine, 15 mg pyrila maleate per pill) and then 60 mg of melatonin, would i be able to kms? im hoping the melatonin would put me to sleep so the effects of the acetaminophen wouldnt be as painful. obviously i would still wake up from it but hopefully not as easy w the melatonin. i was looking and someone said that an easy way to go out would be dissolving sleeping pills in tea (but since unfortunately i dont have those, im trying melatonin then acetaminophen)	motherfuckerreal0	post	27.77686680850591	male	White	0.9966322779655457	na	na	na	1	sad	failed

"She left me. It was my birthday. Happy 20th. We had a whole day together. We spent it all, all together. From dusk till dawn. And then she left me. She left me. Over the phone, not in my face. We both went back to our homes, and she called me. ""Somethings wrong."" ""What's up?"" ""I don't want this relationship anymore"".
It hit me. It punched me. It choked me, it pierced my heart. She was my only. She was my one. She was my only one. We had so much good times together. What'd I do? I didn't get the right to know until this very moment, and I still have not a clue. That's how we ended it. Through the phone. I cannot stop thinking about her. I'm such a sad person. I go back and forth between dating apps, thinking it'd actually give me anything. I hate seeing her there, even though I cannot stop imagining her smile. Breathtaking. She left me.
And it comes and goes. The thoughts, the feelings. I cannot listen to my music anymore. I cannot go certain places anymore. I find little trinkets of hers in my room still. I scream till I break down on the ground, knees bent.
To say it has taken a toll on me is a total understatement. It has taken my life. my will to live. I want her back, but she's probably running around the bar, looking for another guy who can treat her better than I did, somehow.
""I hope you love yourself as much as I do"" - that was the last sentence exchanged between us.

Take life one thing at a time. Anyone blaming you are just trying to protect themselves, everyone is. So should you.

That's awful, I'm so sorry :( All parents should make their children feel safe and loved. Sometimes when under a lot of stress, people can say and do things they don't mean. Try to get used to going outside, just walk around for a bit, push yourself to go to hospital and get the help you need. It's not easy but it's worth it and really important to do at this age. I know it's also scary being alone, but the more you engage with life the more you meet people and get the chance to make new friends.

i accidently pressed yes on the poll cause i only ready the title before clicking and i was imagining like a serial killer who just simply loves to kill and inflict pain , chopping off their body parts and organs and shit. But i was thinkin the ones that think killing themselves is scary asf cause its them at risk i think thats a good punishment. idk why my mind immediatly went there lmao. But if i read under i would have pressed no 100% everyone makes mistakes and does bad things that are sometimes just unethical and truly a horrible thing to do. Everyone can learn from their past and grow. i did some insanely manipulative shit when i was 8 to my grandparents one of the most shitty thing ive ever done looking back at it now, i didnt know what i was doing and how it affects them. I just wanted to feel cared enough they would interfere, i watches to the kitchen and brought it to the living room and started dragging a kitchen knife over my forearms and starting to cut a little before they did rush over and interfere . i was suprised they cared. i was also extremely unaware of retriggering trauma and trauma responses even though if i just thought about it for a little i would have known. My dad died when i was 4, and my grandparents found him in his room dead on a regular ass day , nothing was wrong. He had a fever and it must have been something crazy from what i hear. the point is ive purposly manipulate them and i didnt think how badly i added to that , my grandparents are obv dad's side and imagine having your son die young then your daughter scares u and pulls a stunt like that. Now at my grown age of 18 ive still have done horrible things. in january 2023 . went to a mental hospital cause i was thretening to get a ak47 and shoot myself to death in front of them and stand in a position it would leave stains on the white walls and a big mess .the thing is i was serious and very much suicidal but secretly i wanted help . I cant believe i still did this sort of thing this year. in the months after i honestly have been making significant good progress and i havent done anything like that or even thought abt it when big arguements happened , i will never resort there again, mind you my grandparents are the ONLY reason im alive today. Literally. they are all i have. If one of them died/both id be gone that same day and join them. we all have done some horrible shit, degrees ofc vary drastically for everyone but even heinous ass things you can come back from and live a fulfilling life. also im so sorry this is probably so long ive been just typing not rlly thinking for abt 20 minutes now😭 I honestly dont even expect u to read this lmfaoo.	gorgeousgoldfish	reply	na	na	na	0.994570791721344	no	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.

"This is my first post here, so please go easy.

I'm going through a really difficult situation. I've been having serious troubles in my marriage over the last long while--years even--and a friend of mine who happened to be my best friend knew this and revealed to me she's been in love with me since we met. She sensed my unhappiness and wanted me to leave my wife so that we could be together. And, honestly, she made me feel more special and loved and appreciated than I've felt in such a long time.

I fell in love with her too, but I decided I had to stay to work things out with my wife because of my kids, because of God, because of my own sense of commitment and morality, because I couldn't just give up. I've been trying and trying to get through in my marriage, but I needed to give it one last try. My best friend said she couldn't handle being just friends and had to stop the friendship. One of the last things she said to me was ""I love you xo"" and she was ""losing her best friend and the love of her life.""

I think she must hate me now because she thinks I chose a wife, who never makes me a priority, over her, who always made me feel special. But in reality I had to stay because I didn't want to make such a huge decision based on emotion. I had to stay to work things out. I would have lost everything: my family, my church and friends, my whole support system, and even maybe my kids if they were mad at me for leaving their mom. If I left their mom and started seeing my best friend, they would never accept her because they'd see her as the woman who split their parents up. And if they couldn't accept her, I couldn't.

The truth is I've never made a harder decision in my life, and I think about this all the time. It makes me cry every day. I might have lost out on an opportunity for true happiness for something that may never work out. But most of all I miss my best friend.

It's been about 2 and a half weeks now, and I've been carrying this weight alone since this breakup. Truth is I've been carrying it around even longer than that as I've struggled through all these decisions and situations. I can't tell anyone the whole story because I'm not sure how they'd react. But I just need to get this off my chest.

I just hope that somehow something--God or the universe or whatever does this sort of thing--will tell her I still love her and miss her dearly and still think about her and, most of all, I just want her to be happy and safe wherever she goes.

I don't need advice or especially judgment. All I need is to know someone else knows and maybe offer a bit of encouragement. It's been a very rough time, and I'm not even sure how long it'll be before I have the emotional energy to start working things out in my marriage. Please, if you read this, just let me know you know and care."	stevegershwin	post	25.903908062628172	female	White	0.9922729730606079	na	na	na	3	sad	no prediction.

Today was my birthday, I woke up to no messages from friends, only my manager from work and my grandmother and parents, all my friends have forgotten about me. One I told happy birthday to just yesterday, they never said thank you… only “who is this.” I cried a little knowing that she has already forgotten about me, I never even got a message or call from my best friend, I was at his birthday party not to long ago, maybe 5 days ago. I wish I mattered to someone I used to be close to but they all forgot about me like I was never there for them, everyone I saw as a friend forgot i existed. All I did was go out for food and spend the rest of the day waiting, and waiting hoping that someone would remember me, but once I realized that I’ve been forgotten I just gave up and decided to go to sleep. I just turned 18… forgotten and alone. I’m crying as I type this. Goodnight to anyone who sees this.

"heyy i cant imagine what youre going through, especially in those moments. True friends are going to be the ones to be there for you no matter how much time you spend together/distance apart. Those type of ""friends"" arent really the people u should depend on and expect something, some people just dont care , or are very stressed/lost in thoughts. I know its hard , im trying to set less expectations on old friends from my highschool. surround yourself with people who make u feel cared about, combfortable opening up to , someone you can know will be there for you in tough times, but will also make an effort to share laughs and make memorable good times together. I promise these true friends are out there. im in a similar situation and relate pretty hardly to some of the specifics you mentioned. I remember my 18th, my boss told me happy birthday, my adoptive grandparents, and two of my cousins. no one else. it feels like oh at least we had someone. thats true it could have been worse, but know that no one should have to feel so uncared for and i wish it upon nobody. its truly a horrible feeling and i wish i could speak from experience of how i came back from it. unfortunatly my birthday is in roughly 15 days and it will def be the same people telling me. All i know is that true friends are going to shine and have a welcoming aura that differentiate from people who dont truly care and will go out of their way to be kind/and be there for you. im on my own journey of trying to find some. just know its no rush. and recognize that your importance and validity has NOTHING to do with how many people remembered/ said happy bday to you. yes it feels absolutly lonely, and considering it was just your birthday, know that healing isnt linear . One thing i know for sure is that i would always remember your birthday, but friendship is SO much more than remembering and memorizing facts abt someone. You truly deserve more depedable friends and people around your age, a support system. If you ever need someone i mean it from the depths of my heart , im here for you. I will listen and try my best to help and sympathize . one more thing... HAPPY LATE BIRTHDAY😍😍💚💓💓🎊🎉🎉🎈🎈🎈💌💌🎉🪅🎊🪅🎉🎊🪅😍😘😁 even though i only got a sense of you maybe in like the 20 mins it took me to jamble my thoughts together and type. but in that amount of time i can already tell many things about you. You are caring, empathetic , loved, appreciated, and i promise youre resilient. I truly hope the best for you and hope we can work on our journeys to find healthy trusting and reliable relationships. remember im always always here for you if you want to rant or let it all out and vent to a random teenager on the internet😭💓"	Competitive-Flan7307	reply	na	na	na	0.9989469647407532	weak	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.
"Happy Birthday sweetheart ❤️ 

I've often felt forgotten and uncared for by friends. it's a very crappy feeling. In high school, i invited friends to two events and no one showed up. One was my graduation party, i was a little sad no one came, but it was okay because I had my family there. 

Now, trouble with me is, I remember EVERYONE. I even remember people I went to elementary school with. It's sad for me because I see these people, and when i talk to them, I feel like im always explaining who I am and where I know them from, because they never remember who I am. It can be disheartening. 

I'm sorry your friends forgot to tell you happy birthday, but hey, It's okay, I'm glad you have the people in your life who didn't forget to tell you happy birthday. They're all you need, celebrate your special day with them. 

Growing up, we didn't invite classmates to birthdays, we just had our family there, cake ice cream, and being surrounded by loved ones ❤️ 💖  

I hope next year will be better for you. Happy Birthday ❤️ 🎂"	Competitive-Flan7307	reply	na	na	na	0.9989469647407532	weak	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.

100 percent agree letting life happen and move on and focusing on the present and practicing mindfullness. Forgetting about it and convincig yourself they are simply just shitty people and you truly believe that youre not at ALL the problem . But if there is feelings that they forgot and didnt reach out cause of something related to themselves , an insecurity . Its best in that situation i believe to accept it , it happened it felt horrible, but life moves on and we come back from shit! it was never anything to do with you its their lack of effort they put into being a true friend to you. soon before we know it we will forget about this shit and likely give less and a less shit about your own birthday as years go on by. at least thats how it is for me😭 and my grandparents. wishing you both lots of love .

"Every year when it comes to my birthday I get very melancholy. I just get really sad and just look at my life objectively  and just don't like what I see. I have a ""good"" life, I have a career(that I must admit I'm starting to get over after 2 years of working for this company), but I have a weekend part time job at a brewery that allows me to mingle and be around people I like. I have some money, and no debt.I have friends and a lovely girlfriend. And my family is very supportive. 

Still though I just feel empty and lonely some/most days and I don't really know what to do about it all.  I only bring this up because my bday was last week and it was kind of a lame bday and I just feel like I've been stuck in this pattern of emotion since then. Has anyone struggled with this and if so how did you escape it? Because sometimes it is really to much to bare."	seanthemummy	post	26.12056778574093	female	White	0.995930016040802	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

"my ex-girlfriend/bestfriend has left me afout a month ago and it was my fault.

Long story short, I was too clingy and handled the problems in a shitty manner.

I asked her to at least be my friend because that what we were before. We were bestfriends. I begged her. But she left me because I'm not worthy of her. well, she said some really hurtful things while going away.

""do you not hate yourself?""
""I will literally be friends with anyone but you""
""I don't miss you""
""I don't love you, fuck off""

It hurts so much because of the fact that they came from her. 

I can't let go of her, I tried cutting myself and matter of fact, I literally just cut my thigh 5 times to get myself to cry. but I cant cry anymore. I want to.

Well, she's found a new guy to watch movies with and spend time with. I never was able to give that to her because it was an LDR.

I'm genuinely happy to know that she's happy, bit it still hurts that I don't have her in my life anymore. she's the only person I think of whenever anything happens to me.

I would tell her everything about me. About my prick of a dad, every inconvenience. Now I can't. I miss her. I'm planning to text her 4 months later on her bday. I hope she talks nicely to me."	SillyPizzalove	post	8.29708501238415	female	White	0.9961340427398682	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

Hi M18 here ive been smoking weed since i was 15 thats when my depression started and at first it helped now im just depressed everyday. (Regardless if i smoke or not) Really does suck because i have good friends and a good girlfriend i just feel like crying when im alone and i feel so lost in this life. I feel like im not scared nor do i care if i die im kind of just living. i have many bad habits aswell such as vaping and smoking pot and drinking 2-3x a week. Ive been sober a whole week and i feel even worse. Any thought?

You really need to stop drinking and vaping or smoking pot, seriously it is not good, you are slowly destroying yourself. You just said that you have friends and a girlfriend also, is something that many wish for and still don't have.

I am thinking about dying because every day I still have my head is not right. I went out today and it's still not right. I have been talking to a guy for a long time but he has a girlfriend now. I don't think he ever liked me but I know it is because I am mentally ill and I can't think and act normally. Why am I living? I cannot create anything, I cannot connect with others, I cannot have a partner or my own family, I can't work, I can't think. Every other person can think and respond normally. I don't know what antidepressants will do but what is the point? Animals don't need antidepressants, the ones that do die because they are not fit to survive. Just like I am not. Maybe I used to be. But I am not anymore and I just can't fix it. I don't feel relief in dying, I don't want to die because it is nothingness, I just wanted to be human again but I can't. Time goes on and everyone is dating, getting jobs, creating things, making friends, moving on, and I am still sick. My attitude is poor and I am bad, nothing is working I wish it did.

I been through a lot in my life and for the most part I feel like I handle it pretty well. But nothing can prepare for strong heart break, unbearable torcher of emotions and loneliness and sadness and depression and suicidal thoughts and attempts. Sometimes I do feel like I shouldn't have woken up from COVID. COVID should have finished me off so my family would be a lot happier. Trust me when I say if I die today or tomorrow I wouldn't be miss. No one listens to me, no one cares about me, no one loves me. I'm just a burden on every one's shoulders.

"That is not true. God loves you, you are here for a reason. 

I used to be clinically depressed for years, but seeing a psychologist (who gave me meds), a pastor, and making a friend got me out of it. 

I still cry every other day because of how lonely I am, but I know that living is the better option, no matter how painful it is. 

I don't know you, but I'd give you a high five if I were there now, and buy you a free coffee. 

I recommend watching some anime, such as Spirited Away (anything by Hayao Miyazaki, actually) and seeking a psychologist as soon as possible (!!). I know that the world has no colors for you, that it seems like you are useless etc. This is all a lie, it's your brain not functioning correctly. 

You are beautiful/handsome. You will have a long life ahead of you. Sure it will be difficult, painful, but there will be many happy things in it, I promise.

Gravity on the moon is 1/8th of what it is here. I wish that your sadness will be only 1/8th of what it is now soon.

I’m in the same space as you got everything i ever wanted up until now but now I feel empty like I’m missing a thrill or something. I believe that the little set backs people experience makes life a little more fun for me so if everything is being handed to you right now maybe it’s time to take charge and to start living uncomfortably like try a new hobby or go on a road trip into new land find something fun for you and pursue it.

This is honestly me as well, I have a good career, and I also have a fun second job on the weekend(its just for extra money and to keep me active,I could quit anytime). I have a gf, no outstanding debts(yet), I have friends who actively call and hang out with me. A caring family. But for some reason I just feel so empty inside and lonely some days. I make a good amount of money but when I think about spending any of it I just think (like whats the point). I just get stuck in this thought process of you don't need to buy that cause no one cares, and that translates to me not caring.

Im not rly suicidal but i feel like this world is going to shit like look whats going on around us i live in switzerland where everyone has enough food, water, electricity and even free healthcare but there are whole countries that have none of those and i just feel like i cant do anything to change that because im only 15 years old but i‘ve suffered a lot in my life (ik that sounds dumb cuz i had everything growing up but i grew up in a bad area in lucern where there were multiple drug circles near our home so i could never go out of the house and i got bullied since i came in kindergarden i got hit with a skateboard multiple times by a highschooler… i was like 5 years old and then we finally moved to a different area but i never felt welcome and got bullied even more in middleschool and now i started working this summer and i just feel like this world is slowly falling appart and no one does anything about it like wars, global warming and overpopulation. Also it makes me sad how there are still so many people who do not give a shit about all of this like its our future and we are going to be the ones suffering. Idk what they be thinking?! Like do you think its gonna take like 200 years for it to happen?? No its already happening oceans are rising freshwater is disappearing and wars are escalating. Im sorry if this text is all over the place but i just wanted to get all this off my chest. Now to my title… i rly dont care when i die if i get old or die young i just wanna make an impact like die for a reason not just live life in the hampsterwheel life we are all living so the rich get even richer. No i wanna die doing what i love or at least do like a final act like suicide-bombing elon musk (who doesnt give a shit about the environment) idk i just dont want the world i grew up in go to shit like this…	Technical_Drawer_782	post	23.91048039349357	male	White	0.007021832279860973	na	na	na	1	sad	failed

It’s like we were together for 9 years, she left for her “mental health” and I supported her for that not knowing she was gonna shatter my heart. Long story short we had ups and downs and it wasn’t bad at the end, but I think she is in her “I don’t need anything from anybody stage.” She isn’t hanging out with the greatest influences.

"Since a little over a year ago, my life changed. A year ago, I was a happy person with goals and something to strive for, but as time passed, everything went to hell.

I had a partner with whom I was together for many years during college, and suddenly, when she moved to another city and I was about to move to that same city shortly after, everything got complicated, and we ended up breaking up. In a way, she and the vision of a life together gave me a drive to keep going, but since then, everything in my life feels grey. I've tried to keep trying, searching for new things to do, meeting more people, and advancing in my career, but the truth is, I'm tired of it all. I can't find anything that motivates me to get up in the mornings. I feel like I'm living out of inertia, and not a day goes by without a depressive moment of reflection, and my happy moments are just that, moments.

I feel like I'm increasingly considering the option of suicide. It's truly exhausting to live like this. I don't want to get out of bed in the morning, and at night, I don't want to go to sleep because my thoughts drown me, that's why I only go to sleep when I'm really tired or after a lot of alcohol. Even though I sought professional help from a psychologist, things haven't improved much. The anxiety attacks and the almost crippling depression I had for a while have subsided, but that doesn't mean I have a reason to live.

I'm tired of this situation. I just wish I could wake up and think about what needs to be done that day, instead of waking up with memories of a happy past and a future that will never be."	DonAndroos	post	19.152767860519525	male	White	0.9991070628166199	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

(I’m severely dyslexic so please stick with me on the spelling and grammar ❤️ so sorry) 

When I say almost nobody, I mean everyone of my closest friends but two. With this said they all have valid reasons for no being able to come but I can’t help but be extremely embarrassed and upset, let me explain. 

My sister and I are extremely close and we just happened to have our birthdays a week apart from each other , although she’s 3 years older then me. This means she will be turning 21 a week after I turn 18, two massive milestones and celebrations. 

As she is a working women she decided to have her party celebration on the 12 of August, as that day seemed to have to most available in her massive group of friends when her actually birthday is on the 21. To save the hassle of having two parties my parents told me to invite my friends 2 as my birthday is only two days later on the 14. 

I have absolutely no problem sharing anything with my sister, we’re very close so that’s not the issue. The issue is that none of my friends are able to come and although I love my sisters older friends I’m afraid they’re going to judge my for only have two people at my “party”. 

I’m thinking I might invite my two friends and just pretending it’s just my sisters celebration. Although sad, it seems like the best option for me to do, just let her have the night to herself. 

I don’t know what about this is making me so upset, I’m just so ashamed of being lonely I suppose."	Playful_Apricot_7933	post	22.420331177108825	male	White	0.9978432655334473	na	na	na	2	sad	failed

I don't know where to start. Eveer since late 2018 my life has been sorta going downhill. I had an accident involving my bike that scarred me for life ; I lost my grandma the very next day ; in 2019 I lost my second Grandmother and my mother sort of jjst lost herself in 2020 , I sorta just went mad during lockdown. I became depressed about not seeing anyone physically. In January 2021 , my mom went psycho on me and would literally try to hurt me or insult me ,whether or not I woud deserve it and we sorta just never got along. And that same year my last grandfather passed away and that was it all my grandparents were dead. In july 2021 , I became super depressed within myself and I was sleeping less and less. I was just not feeling me anymore and I thought what's the point. So what I tried to do was literally jump out my own window but I thought of how that could affect everyone else so i forfeit that attempt. In November 2021 , i fell out woth my best friends and from there I realised this , no one really appreciates my exsistence so I tried to kill myself again by laying on the road ready for a car. But again , I stopped myself. I went to hospital multiple times over and over again at late hours in the night because of these habits. I should mention that I don't vape or smoke or drink. And as well as that , i went through therapy for about 3 months and it was the most miserable shit EVER , I started to feel worse. And in April or March 2022 , my parents were often fighting and nearly filed for a divorce , I started to feel more and more and more miserable so I called a suicide hotline and discussed about my situation. In May 2022 , I FINALLY got a girlfriend , but we broke up in March 2023 ,  I'm still at this point in my life where I just question is life even worth living anymore , is it ? Idk , maybe i should be thinking about suicide or self harm more , I should feel really miserable , I feel like a burden.

"Your life is very valuable and you are irreplaceable. I am not sure how old you are but it doesn’t matter, suicide doesn’t solve anything, it only guarantees that things will never get better. 

I felt like that for my whole life until about 2 years ago. I ended a really toxic relationship I had been in for 7 years and then I got Covid and then my apartment flooded and then I got evicted, horn into a car accident & my mom went into kidney failure (she’s ok, waiting for transplant now)

The point is that it can’t rain forever. It’s hard now yes, but it won’t always be. It’s okay to feel sad but it isn’t ok to stay there forever.

If you died (in any way but especially by suicide) your family would grieve your loss forever and they probably would end up all drifting apart. Suicide is very confusing - your loved ones never get to really know why. Even with a note, they will always wonder & always blame themselves.

Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, u can still talk to a therapist tho. Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible. Look up Bobby price guy health. U can’t end ur only life which is all u know by ending ur life. Don’t think mood swings last forever. Look for small thrills and the bigger ones will  come. Look up how to deal with Loneliness by dry creek ranger school. Suicide is a permanent fix to a temporary problem.

"I live deep in the countryside and I'm on holiday. It has been a month now that my social interactions are limited to rare interactions with my family while eating (when I don't eat alone). I'm not really a social guy, and as far as I know I might be an introvert.
 The last significant conversation I had was with my boyfriend before we broke up. Since then I feel so empty. Because even if I was alone I didn't feel alone thanks to him. But now that he's gone I feel so lonely... I frogot how hard it hits when no one comes to your mind when you need to think to something else.
In front of the mirror I watch myself with discuss. I tell myself that it wasn't meant to last because of me. That I'm a failure with no real friends. 
Everyone is going forward and I'm tired of running.
I'm tired. I'm alone. I pass my days filled of anger towards myself. I try to do sports and study but all I feel is hopelessness. 
Sometimes I want to die, then I remember that I'm to scared of death. So I move on.

I've never been successful in life, my multitude of phobias make me scared to even go outside, not to mention talk to people, I've only been a burden on my family, and as a result I've been ostracized, sent to multiple foster homes, and abandoned to the system. I want to end it, but I'm too much of a coward to do it since I'm afraid of the pain, so I want to find a painless way to put a stop to my suffering. If I go on any longer I fear my pain will begin to affect others, and I don't want that, I want it to stay with me and end with me ASAP. Is there anyone out there who can help me?

I know in these situations you don’t want to hear things like, you have so much to life for, but really all life is important and even if you haven’t found anything yet you can be useful for you might find something in the future. I felt like this a few years back and started to do mission work and felt a lot better because I felt I was helping someone. But if you are determined that you don’t want to live anymore at least make it painless, you can buy nitrogen online and if you lock your car you will suffocate without your body realizing because of the way it measures breathing and it will feel like going to sleep.

"i dont even want a GF, because i literally have no idea what we would talk about. sick of one line replies or me obsessively sending long texts trying to make them laugh. i really hate this version of my self. i want to change. 

i guess this is what i get for making my life goals ""Porn/Sexting"" im tired of basing my self worth on external things like this. i know i need to make my self happy and no one else will.

i dont know what other goals to chase other than ""Self Improvement""

Anytime i see someone having a fun/long conversation I get jealous and mad at my self for not having a Cool/Funny/Smart/Intelligent personalized like that. sometimes im even intimidated by them because i think that they are ""Too cool for me or better than me"" i hate this thinking. 

Tired of basing my self worth on the number of friends i have which are 0, or how many conversations i have which are pretty low or how people react to things i said. 

maybe i was just saying some things that i thought is what they wanted to hear not really what i wanted to say. sometimes i had no idea what to say though 

i want to improve my social skills and my conversations and my personality

i have messaged like thousands of girls online, mostly would respond with one word replies, i know the problem was me. 

maybe i wasn't really interested in getting to know them, i was just looking get nudes or sext to prove to my self that im worthy or cool or funny or ""Good enough"" 

besides that i really had no idea how to get to know them without making the conversations sound like an interview or boring then i would base my self worth on how i was boring and didn't know what to talk about. 

or i would run out of questions to ask quickly, basic it was like impossible to make a friend. it was impossible to get people to talk to me 

maybe i was just boring them and they were dealing with their own problems or busy days.

The conversations were always one sided, always me talking more, saying more, asking more questions, always starting the conversations after a day we talked. it was boring for me..

maybe i was looking to fill up my boredom by talking to girls? and i know thats not what girls are for. girls want to be connected and i want that too but had no idea how so i would just try to sext. 

i would ask questions and they would just say yes or no, nothing more. soon i would run out of things to talk about or i had no idea what to talk about 

because the conversions were boring i guess i was just losing interest because of how hard i tried with no results, i couldn't even make a friend

i was interested, then quickly lose interest because i had no idea what to talk about or what to say or what i should say. 

im not afraid to start conversations, i just don't know what to say. 

and pretty sure the girls dont want the conversation to just be about sex... 

i know i shouldn't look at girls as sex objects and they are human with goals, dreams, ambitions, Passions, and their own feelings. i know that now. 

but the idea of how i suck at making friends makes me lose interest in talking... 

would reading ""How to win Friends and Influence People"" help? or ""No more Mr nice Guy"" ? 

or just anything 

does this go back to self esteem issues? 

I have so many problems so many questions..

unfortunately no hobbies to release the stress."	Butcher__1	post	18.188636742983697	male	White	0.9991320967674255	na	na	na	2	sad	no prediction.

"I need to rant and don't really have anyone to talk to so here I am, on reddit at half 2 in the morning.

I suffer alot from depression and anxiety which has affected me since high school. It has made my life unbearable at times, sometimes hoping I don't wake up the next day. 

Through the years, i've built up the strength to fight against these feelings so it doesn't hit as hard as before and have kept this part of myself on the down low so practically no one knows this about me (I have a quite jokey and unserious personality so it's easy to hide and people rarely see me sad). It made making friends difficult, so the ones I did make must've been a miracle. 

As of now, I am part of this trio with my 2 other friends from high school (19 M and 18 M). One I knew from family friends and occasional parties but didn't get close with until around 5th year. The other, I shared music classes with him and got along with each other. The two were always close with eachother and then I eventually slid my way into the friendship and we all began hanging out with each other alot more. 

We recently graduated high school last year, which was difficult for me as it meant I had to part ways from people I've known for years and despite the often ""we'll always stay in contact"", there are some close friends I haven't spoken to ever since. I thought Uni would be a great chance to meet new people, but being an introvert kinda ruins that and my issues wrecked my chances, so usually rely on the 'mutual friends' pathway in meeting people. So, I have mostly hung out with the two. We hang out alot, go out clubbing, have bbqs, cheeky trips to spoons and recently (not really, it was last yr in august) went on holiday together.

I sometimes get episodes where I become completely miserable and depression hits, usually late at night and begin to rethink my life, questioning why I am the way I am. I've made it a habit to badmouth myself and list the things I despise about myself in my head. Sometimes, it hits during the day so I have to occasionally cancel plans cuz I don't want to go out and ruin the vibe with them. 

Reflecting on my life has made me realise how lucky I am to have these 2. Every time I hang with them, It's like I've lost all the weight on my back and I'm no longer stressed or sad anymore. In a way, I feel relaxed and at ease when I am around them and make my life easier to bear. They know nothing about how I feel or their significance to me and knowing myself, I doubt I would tell them this as I'd just embarass myself. I'm just greatful to have friends like them, it feels like the universe gave them to me knowing I'd need it. We all have our banter and joke around but they are very caring and share alot in common. I honestly don't deserve them."	LimitPsychological	post	27.770020375441792	female	White	0.00144933199044317	na	na	na	4	sad	failed

Life is too short for depression or anything else to consume ur life, u might be viewing life in a negative way, u wont fond happiness by doing that. Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, u can still talk to a therapist tho. Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible. Look up Bobby price guy health. U can’t end ur only life which is all u know by ending ur life. Don’t think mood swings last forever. Look for small thrills and the bigger ones will  come. Look up how to deal with Loneliness by dry creek ranger school. Suicide is a permanent fix to a temporary problem.

"First of all, thank you for the comment: I am not sure how to immediately respond. I do engage in exercise, I have been running from a very young age and I am currently building up to do it as much as I did in my peak ( I did 18km every day or every other day). And for the rest of it. I do have many hobbies. I love reading, playing music, and doing art stuff. I also do have friends and my family situation is good. I am familiar with how it feels when I would need crisis help, as I have been in such a mind space before. I am not familiar with the self help recommendations you gave but I am a philosophy nerd and I have some problems with those kinds of things in principle (and I have engaged with them at times to be familiar with them). I guess the only other thing I have to say is all the talk about life as if it is inherently important. I am completely okay with not having it. I am not saying I am in any danger of taking my own for the time being, I just don't get why I should want to be grateful or want to preserve it. I hope this is the only life we get. I guess my main problem is I don't get why anyone wants this.

I won't bore you with some grandiose speech or some quote you've heard repeated ad nauseum, but you need to know for every person that treats you poorly in life, there are so many more who can change your perspective and help you find parts of yourself you didn't know even existed, and that by taking such drastic action, you could not lose only the opportunity to have those experiences, but  also hurt those who value you in the present, find those people, who make you feel more complete, who make you want to be a better person, because people like that are worth living for	Environmental_Ad9039	reply	na	na	na	0.9980149269104004	weak	no	no	na	sad	failed
It doesn’t have to end this way, you can still climb out of this dark hole of pain. I know how agonizing this feels but please, you still have a chance as long as you’re alive, you’re gonna cause so much pain to yourself and others by doing this. This isn’t even to mention the high likelihood that you will survive with permanent injuries. I urge you to talk to anybody about this, if you don’t have anybody you can talk to me.

"I know you’ve probably heard this a lot, but 19 is still young.

Trust me…I was suicidal all my life all the way up to college. There wasn’t a single night I could go to bed without crying myself to sleep.

After dropping out of college, I got a good job and met a wonderful girlfriend.

I promise there is a beautiful world out there. You might just be surrounded by bad people, you may meet someone special someday.

Pls don’t don’t do it. You may not know me but I love you and I appreciate you. You need to hold onto to hope. But you also need to be able to find meaning for yourself. Live for yourself not for others. Screw what other people think. again love for your self. I’ve been hating myself for a long time and believed that people would care if I disappeared, sometimes it still feels like that but I’d rather prove that I do have worth and prove people wrong. Not get their self pity. Look I can’t know what you’re going through but I promise you that you will be ok, It won’t be easy, life never is. But there is something amazing waiting for you.

"So what is your response? To just give up and die because there will be pain? 

That is truly a pathetic way of thinking, regardless of what the world has done to me I don’t deserve to die over it.

You don’t have to suffer like this, and again suicide is not going to resolve the problem in the way you think it will. Like I said, the likelihood of failure and permanent injury is going to be very very high. You’re only going to be causing more pain to yourself. The best way to stop the suffering is to work through it over time. You’re throwing away any and all chances for things to be good for you if you kill yourself.

"I absolutely love my parents, especially my mother. But I think she's the cause of most of my mental health issues, or it's just me looking for attention, even though I feel as if I get enough of it. My little sister needs more of it from my mom, it feels that way anyway. But I sleep for most of the day, so I don't know anymore. I've been having mental breakdowns more often nowadays, I hate it. Why can't I just be mom and dad's happy little girl? Why am I like this? I've told my mom and dad, mostly my mom, many times about how I feel. I've had mental breakdowns during those times I've told them. During the last week of May, before my birthday, I was going to do suicide. But I was afraid of death, so I didn't. I talked to my mom about it, she just said I was trying to get attention when she was talking to my dad about what I said, in another room. The next day I convinced my parents to take me to an emergency room, but somehow, I was in a better mood. I think that's a reason why I couldn't get the help I expected to get. Then again, I forgot what I had expected to get. The social worker that spoke with me kept rubbing In on my face how much my mother cares about me. I knew that. When her and me were talking about things to try and help me take a bath and get out of my room (she was doing most of the talking) she suggested things like getting a scented soap, or giving my cats a bath. Scented soap seems expensive, (I have no idea since I've never purchased any) and it'd be a waste of money anyway. That's all I remember about that visit to the emergency room. Oh, and the long wait, but I don't have problems with that, docters and nurses are busy people after all. No need to rush. 
I've gotten so much worse since then. A week or so ago, I texted a hotline when I was feeling extremely suicidal again, I didn't fear death during that time. I rejected the offer to have someone sent over, and I told the person that I would have my dad take me to the emergency room when they suggested it. I chickened out, instead I fucking vented to my online freinds. How pathetic. 
I had another mental breakdown when I was explaing to my mom how I felt, which was a day or three days ago. I can't remember. But she told me to snap out of it, then she told me that I didn't care about her feelings. And to just take a damn shower. If only it was that easy, why can't I just take a fucking shower? All she seems to care about is if her kids look presentable. 
Oh, and she claims my little sister, when she was just four, had depression during the time I was in the hospital for health reasons. (Not mental health) and that she got out of it, why can't I? What? When did she have depression? I don't entirely doubt it, but did she ever get tested for it? No, she didn't back then. 
Now she says I dont have depression at all, nor am I suicidal. Im just angry for some reason. What happened to my mom? She was the best mom ever. Why is she saying all these things? 
She keeps threatening to send me to a center/institution for a while, empty threats. I was afraid to go to my first psychiatrist appointment due to her actually following through with it. That was a long time ago. I had shaved my stupid hair since then. My hair was a mess, and it is now. I shaved it because I thought if I got rid of the cursed rats nest, mom would be happy. She was. 
I think the only things that are keeping me going now, is my sister, and my love for cooking and food, online freinds and my cats. But even that's beginning to not work anymore. 
Everyone's plotting against me, no one loves me, they pretend they do. They want to manipulate me. 

I know this thinking isn't normal, it can't be. My online freinds have suggestioned getting myself some help, call the hotline again. But if I do, my parents will be upset, my sister will be sad. 

During may, before I convinced my parents to send me to the emergency room. My mom was angry, so angry. For a total of four days straight. She's not abusive, she doesn't hit us. But mentally? I'm not sure. I blame my dad somewhat for that, but I shouldn't. Why couldn't I help my mom more with the house? Why couldn't dad help more? Why couldn't I get off my fatass and help? 

I thought about running away with my sister during that time, maybe with our cat aswell. But that's a stupid thought, we wouldn't survive a day. I wanted to die so badly during that time. I told my mom about this after my mom had calmed down, and I already said what she had said. Attention seeker, your fine, you just need a shower. 

Snap out of it, take a shower, you don't have depression your just angry, get out of bed for once, snap out of it, snap out of it, be a better sister for your little sister, think of my feelings, your not a cutter. 

Fuck, I can't do this anymore. I'm to damn nervous to call my docter myself to see what I should do, or text a hotline. It took so much just to text them a week ago. I can't even talk right, I can't put my thoughts into vocal words.

This probably doesn't even make sense anymore, I'm half asleep. It's 8 am, I've been awake since around 7 pm."	catlover00359	post	21.07910022295304	male	White	0.9977567791938782	na	na	na	4	sad	failed

Unfortunately it is very common for parents to not understand mental health issues and suicidal thoughts and give advice such as “you’re over-exaggerating” or “it’s not so bad, you’ll be fine” or “you’re just feeling sorry for yourself/seeking attention” and things of the like, which seems to line up with what your mom is telling you. None of this actually helps and it usually just makes the suicidal individual feel worse. They’re not trying to make you feel worse, it’s just the growing awareness of mental health issues that we’re seeing now is after their time so they don’t understand it. Anyways I think this makes a lot of sense and I think what you’re experiencing is completely normal and happens to a lot of people. It is not my place to recommend you to professional help or anything like that, instead I can say maybe think about the pros and cons of doing this in making that decision. And for the record I’m not sure if being unable to seek these out is actually cowardly but I do know that from my experience it’s extremely hard and I still haven’t done it despite possibly needing it for myself. What I can say is that I’m sorry for all of your struggles, it sucks that they are happening to you, and I hear you out and I got you.	catlover00359	reply	na	na	na	0.9977567791938782	weak	no	no	na	sad	failed

"I'll be honest with you — I feel the same for about two weeks straight, but I power through it.

Yes, it feels like no one cares and nothing matters, but there's a concept called embracing your problems. I still suck at it, but the main thing is:

You say ""I want to be an astronaut!""

The world says ""You'll never be an astronaut""

Then you feel rejected and slapped across the face. You look at this situation and ask yourself: how did the thing just happened make me better? Am I better at surviving rejection now? Do I know the world better? Am I better at managing my expectations (of the world, not of myself).

I’m 23 and still figuring it out, as a kid sure I did, now I’m older and I see all these other religions/fanatics that spew hate. Muslims got so many rules and the religion/culture doesn’t treat women right, Christians are so against the LGBTQ, and some of the shit they say is just down right idiotic, “Oh no, a school shooting, let’s pray for the families.” Ummm?? How many times can you pray till God listens, if he’s all powerful, those kids wouldn’t have died, you just can’t admit your right wing party is the problem. I’d love to be able to die and know I’m going to a happy place with my friends and family, but I only see that as reassurance to people that are dying to not feel bad.

"Hey I'm a 11 Male. I have a great family, with two brothers and a mother and father. I'm a the middle kid, I don't really get that much attention like my other brother. I'm more like a disappointment everytime I leave my room I get in trouble and most of the times I did nothing at all. Lately I've gotten a dog and now I feel even more useless. I still have the about to be happy laugh and joke around but always in the back of my mind I just feel so judged and empty. No one really knows about it I just keep it to myself but now I really need help. I'm currently at the lowest of my life, I'm also so scared to tell my parents. My parents have  found some sketchy note I wrote (it includes sh.) tThey said they were going to do something about it but never did, so i just downloaded reddit and created this account for help. I vent to some of my freinds but they just say something that never helps like ""its just a bad day"" or ""you're trying to get attention"" and it actually hurts. I really hope venting out here will work, and not turn into those reddit jokes. I have felt empty or depressed for 5-4 years. I'm confident that theres no way to get better but I should at least try shouldn't I?

Man. I wish I could say it will get easier but in reality it may get worse before it gets better. But believe me it will. I’m 23 and still feel like a kid. My 10/11-16/17 years were rough for sure. Take you’re time, talk to someone you trust. You may not have that person now but you will. It may be a teacher, sibling, new friend, etc. But just stick out these teenage years and things will look up. I hope they do start looking up soon.

( Sorry for the spelling mistakes) When I was your age I felt the exact same way and it hasn’t exactly gone away or gotten any better or worse it’s just kinda there. Their will be moments where you want to never die and feel free and happy or moments where you want to be dead more then anything I’m not gonna sugarcoat it and say it will get better but it won’t get worse, I’ve tried many things to make that feeling go away some I’m still stuck with and probably never get rid off, so right now you should try and get help a good talk with your parents can maybe help which will suck and feel awkward but be worth it before you end up going down a path of trying drugs or alcohol to feel temporarily happy because that will lead to addiction, I hope you find peace little dude.

"A few things I've learned that might help. Parents aren't perfect for starters. They aren't psychic. Don't always do the best thing, or have the right answers. They're people. They try. Sometimes they need help. Especially when it comes to dealing with their kids. If you need to express yourself, ask questions, vent, whatever, keep trying. Don't give up. Maybe they will understand? Maybe they'll know how to help? Maybe they won't? Long as you're all trying, that's all that matters. I had A LOT of stuff ""wrong"" with me growing up. There was no one like me. I suffered in silence. Even times when I tried to explain what I THOUGHT was going on with me, they couldn't relate. I honestly don't think I could help myself if I went back in time. I'd be sitting next to my parents with my head in my hands like ""there's no reaching him"". And I have more info to work with. I see the stuff as it's happening. I know all the hows and whys. If I couldn't handle me, what chance did they have? So be patient. They absolutely mean well. They just need help. 

And you might be seeking attention. They could've fallen into a habit of blaming you for things. Only you know for sure. Everyone has their something. No one on this planet is burden free. Just know that whatever you're going through, it's absolutely normal. And you're never alone. Just like parents and adults, you have to know when to ask for help.

Yeah it’s so hard. I’m 15m and I get it. There’s no reason, just suddenly you can’t get happy and life hurts so much. If you wanna talk I’m all ears.

"At 14 you should not be feeling this way and it may be signs of a medical condition, there is no stigma if you do have some form of mental illness, hell these days its like a badge of honor almost implying superhero status that you lived with it at all. but the worst thing you can do both for you and your family is not talk to them and / or your doctor about it.

Talking to your friends is fine but at the end of the day they are likely to be the same age as you are and not have had the life experience to deal with the situation and in some cases while its not nice they may avoid you because of it.. you don' want that , you want things to get better not worse.

Best advice is seek help and do it sooner rather than later."	Past-Dog5517	reply	na	na	na	0.9986554384231567	weak	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.

You don’t have to be on antidepressants. Clinical psychologists for example are trained in psychotherapies and assessments and wouldn’t prescribe you medication. And medication can’t be prescribed to you without consent anyway, at least when you’re not a danger to yourself I think? Non-medication based treatments have been displayed to be extremely helpful on their own as well. And let me tell you, repressing it and ignoring it is going to make it worse, as opposed to talking about it. It might be difficult to talk about but I do think you should do this.

 This is a real person btw: If you add a little bit of activity each day, dont go too fast, you will feel better, l like too run. Be proud of what u accomplish not mad at what u didn't. Life is too short for depression or anything else to consume ur life, u might be viewing life in a negative way, u wont fond happiness by doing that. Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, u can still talk to a therapist tho. Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible. Look up Bobby price guy health. U can’t end ur only life which is all u know by ending ur life. Don’t think mood swings last forever. Look for small thrills and the bigger ones will come.

"I'm so sad. Depressed and hopeless. I am a mother of 4. 18m triplet girls and a 3 year old boy. I'm on autopilot. I feel like nothing I do is the right thing. 

My boyfriend, father of my children, I've feel like I've always loved. I've always poured into him, validated him, took care of him. Whatever he needed I was there - or so I thought. 

Anytime I bring up these issues he has 10 negetive things to say about me and my navigation of our relationship. 

There have been a few hiccups in our relationshipship- mostly around him cheating and my jealous aftermath. I feel like I've been so stupid and now there is no escape. I'm trapped in this loveless relationship. 

I have a previous post describing the cheating if you care to look. I barely have the energy to get this post out, I'm in trouble at work because I'm not as productive I should be. I don't even know what to do or exactly how I feel. I'm just so depressed. 

I feel better when I'm with my kids but now when he is around I just feel scared. He is not a physical threat whatsoever but I just feel scared and I don't understand it. This isn't want I wanted. 

Growing up the way I did, for short, neglected- all I ever wanted was love. Maybe there is something broken and I don't even understand how to feel it if it's around? 

I don't have any close friends anymore, ans I can't bear to tell either of our families- it's just embarrassing. We've tried therapy, it didn't go well. 

I just want to be happy and now I'm not even sure I know what that is."	ThrowRA76738g	post	22.891622331569337	female	White	0.999184787273407	na	na	na	4	sad	failed

You are not stuck in that relationship. You are just going to have to put on your big girl panties and get your kids and walk away. If he's that toxic to you guess what happens when the kids get older. Either he is going to be toxic to them or he is going to teach that toxic behavior to your kids. And that's never good.

"FYI: As you can see, I'm still alive. 

Anyways, I've made enough posts detailing the fact that my life sucked. (And is still very much sucking)

The real problem is how I'm doing now. You see, this trauma single-handedly shaped my personality. I've started to view myself as a horrible person. Here's the deal: I have depression, anxiety and paranoia, adhd and Aspergers. All these disorders contribute to me being the way I am. (Also, I'm a 14-year-old in the middle of puberty, which isn't really helpful) What I'm trying to say is: I'm completely detached from the world, doing things and saying things which are stupid, extremely annoying and sometimes just disturbing and inappropriate. I have anger issues, often making me take violent\\agressive action towards others. I don't want to be like this. I want to be able to walk up to people, to talk,  I don't want to hurt or insult anyone, i don't want to dissapoint and annoy everyone, I don't want any of this. I don't want to be stuck in this hellcycle anymore. I don't want this life anymore. I'm nothing but a dissapointment, an obstacle, an idiot, a thief and a liar. This world doesn't deserve assholes like me. I'd do everyone a favor by killing myself. I hope that this ends soon.  And I hope that this is my last post.

So I’m a Korean and Black dude and I was born in Japan and I go there every now and then with my family, well one time I was going there for the whole summer to see my cousins and aunt and uncle and live with them while going to school, at this school I was the only black kid there so naturally, these kids thought I was weird. But, we made bonds and I eventually became friends with some of these kids, but when I left they gave me a book of staples flash cards and each of them had a note and a picture they drew for when I left the country again  and for the life of me I cannot find it again, it just sucks because I will probably never see or hear from them again.

He’s very religious but he used to talk to me all the time now he just ignores me like everyone else like I’m not even there. I just try to be friendly and he told me it’s not about being friendly he could be possessed by demons.

"You dont really seem to put enough work, or you just lack the skill. The thing with the world we are living in, is that people wont care about the time you spend on something. People care about the result.

It isnt as simple as hoping for them to give you a chance. Life is not a movie, and you need more skill than you already have.

Do not make a victim out of youeself, and prove them wrong by showing them your actual skill. I know a dude with high ego, and he wont ever admit that he is bad at something. We were friends at some point in life, and I borrowed his negative traits. I had very high ego because of it, and I thought I was a really skilled and creative child. Only to realise I sucked at everything. I dont know you this much, but you seem like me back then, or the dude Im talking about.

I don't know whether anyone knowing me will be reading this though i am writing this with a anonymous account but i don't even trust this shit now like i trusted my diary but it was also read by my parents and after they got to know about that i was about to kill myself , so they just started faking the feelings for me this is what i think because only after reading my diary they got this love where as it when i was suffering all only from 5 years where was their dear child that time . I think they are only doing this so if i suicide they don't have to answer anyone, and no one blames them. They have just locked me up in a room and i am just forced to study and go to school. They have taken my all means of communication with my old friend (my actual friends) and also made me transferred to a different city school and told me to start a new life (HOW TO FUCK THAT WORKS) and being a introvert with mental instability, short temper, anger issues I can't even talk to someone. how am i supposed to study when there too much going in my brain and according to them it will all get right just i have to recite god's name like they for real think this would help me. I had a person in my life i thought would be with me, but she also went on her way saying i need to focus on my studies like i shared a lot about me to her and this now also broke my trust. My parents say share your problems with me how am i supposed to share i just don't know what's wrong with me i just want to die living in this world with all cursed human relationship is just ruining my mental state. i just want peace but i can't get it until i end up dying. i am so mentally fucked that i self-harm to an extent that i pass out for hours, i ate all the meds there available to me, give cuts to my body such that blood just flows and flows though i couldn't build up courage to cut my vein, i punch steal trees such that my knuckles started bleeding and also one of the fingers knuckles bone broke. and presently i am so mentally fucked that i can't focus on my study's and about having human relationship (friends, brother, son) i don't care about them now i am basically a psycho who just wants to die no matter what but only one thing i can do is just pray to God for death as i am just being watched 24/7, never left alone. I can just pray that someone kills me or i just met an accident. I just wanted normal life, but God didn't want like what a 11 year (I am 16 now) would have done to suffer from this, holding back all my emotions, feelings, and also lost my interest in all things. This all led to a state where i couldn't control my emotion (i just laugh randomly, cry randomly) anxiety / panic attacks are frequenting, i became completely silent and lost my will to even breathe. and all my parents says why don't to be like other kids look at them enjoy your life like them by ignoring the doing of them to me.

idk anymore. every day i wake up feeling stressed and sad. i always find new things to hate about myself, whether it’s something about my body or about my personality. literally when i finally feel good looking for once i find smth ugly abt my body and poof, my whole day is ruined. took a few tests made by real professional psychiatrists, turns out i’m very likely to be depressed. my family has a bunch of family issues (but honestly i don’t feel comfy sharing them on here) and i found out that my bsf was fake all along. and i relapsed my self harm. was sober for almost 6 months and i relapsed a few days ago. i’ve been trying to lose weight but junk food always gets in my way. but my biggest problem is: when i want to cry, no tears come out. but when i do not wanna cry (in public, in school, in front of friends etc) i do cry. i have no motivation to do anything else than to be on my phone anymore."	russianrice1	post	21.971083097534148	male	White	0.9980127811431885	na	na	na	4	sad	no prediction.

I truly know how that feels. And I wish I had something positive to say but I can't tell you how you should feel but do this for me tho. Take one hour each day and sit in silence. Wether you are at home or out in about take 1 hour to sit in silence. Then take another hour bumping your favorite song and yes I know songs are only 3 minutes long. But so who gives a fuck! Put it on repeat. Play your favorite song for an hour and that should lighten your mood. It works for me. It might work for you.	russianrice1	reply	na	na	na	0.9980127811431885	weak	strong	no	na	sad	failed
"I'm a very emotional/sensitive person but usually I am good at hiding my anxiety and emotional-ness. However for example today I was at a group I go to and I knew that I was experiencing worsening anxiety and heightened sensitivity/confusion because of the fact that I'm due my period soon. And I'm pretty sure that the other people who I know/see at the same group every Monday, could tell that I was anxious or unsettled. It just makes me feel guilty because I feel like when most people are feeling so anxious/overwhelmed by their emotions, it's almost like all we can see is how anxious or emotional we feel, and I feel like it can unintentionally make us block out or forget that other people who are seeing us anxious or upset, also may likely feel unsettled or sad/concerned seeing someone in that state. For example I had gone to the toilet and when I came back I was trying to pull a chair out from where it had got stuck under one of the desks in the room, to sit on it, and my anxiety was causing me to struggle to push the chair out and I don't think I imagined it but one of the other people in the room I think they sort of gave me a bit of a sad/concerned kind of look.

I messed everything in my life up. My brain is messed up. All over such things that were silly and didn't matter. I don't know if I suddenly had an illness or if I caused this downfall. But I know it is my fault. For years now. I wish I felt sad. Real sad. I'm sorry for everything I have done. I'm sorry I ruined everything and I ruined myself. I'm sorry I don't draw anymore. I'm sorry I lost myself completely in heart, soul, body, and mind. I'm sorry for how empty and cruel I am now. I wish I had made deeper connections with those I loved who have moved on. I wish someone helped me. But that is too much to wish for, I should have been able to help myself. Please forgive me. Please heal me. Please can I make up for what I've done and be clear and soft and kind. I want to see colours in the world and I want to love. I've been to a very far bottom and I'm still down there with a mind that is not mine. This is hard. Hard when I struggle to help my mind so much. I'm sorry for the horrible thoughts I've had and still have in my twisted mind, I am worthless and rubbish. I hope with no worth I can at least heal my mind and observe this world. I don't want to bother anyone and I don't want to, I am not worth it in any manner. I should support and help others. You should be with others that make you happy. If god exists I wish they would heal me. I am getting older and I feel like I'm worth less and less but I wish for a mind that is something that I thought was me.

"Whoa, whoa. You’re 17 and afraid you won’t make millions? Many athletes get injuries that put them out of the game. If that should happen and you have no solid plan A (yes - sorts is plan B) then what?

Use your college years to get into a career that has solid future opportunities. Think of ways you could branch off if necessary. It’s fine to play sports but do it because you enjoy it. Right now, it’s a source of huge stress for you. If you should have a successful sports career, his for you but always have another career you can count on if that doesn’t work out. 

I don’t know why or how you decided that you alone are to bear all this responsibility. Even the stress alone will erode your confidence and lessen your chances of success.  Please use this time to work hard but also to make friends, to do enjoyable things that won’t get you into trouble.  All that adult responsive comes too soon.

"This is my story. When I was 13 I was put on a suicide watch by my school for wanting to kill myself and constantly self harming. My name's Kyrene, I'm a highschool student who has ADHD anxiety and my doctors will be testing me for possible autism. When I was in grade 7th I was 12 and 13 through that school year I was on a suicide watch do to my mental stability getting low well this was the week after fall/thanksgiving break and my arms down to my wrist and thighs were all cut up from me S/hing. My science teacher and bus driver also had problems when she was my age and she considered me as her daughter and I considered her my mom as well. I called her ""My School Momma."" And we'd tell other students she was my mom, many did think we looked alike too and her two daughter that were substitutes at my school as looked much like me so it wasn't hard to convince people she was my biological mom. She has saw my arms despite the hoodie I was wearing and at the end of the class she pulled me aside. I was confused at first because I've heard of teacher S/aing student so I was scared. She looked at me and started crying and hugged me and asked if I was cutting myself and i started crying too as I told her yes and she brought me to the councilor crying as well as me. Then everyday since then she would do anything to make me feel better and she'd talk to me about when she had cancer and how she kept believing and she wanted me to keep believing and at the end of the year on the last day of school she hugged me and said ""I'm proud you didn't give up."" Said she loved me and then I got of the bus holding back tears after saying I loved her back."	misaki_usagi_cute	post	22.352280695466135	female	White	0.0017754124710336328	na	na	na	3	sad	failed

I know how tough it is to suffer from problems like that, and neurodivergence in schools is treated so poorly, I’ve been there and it’s incredibly isolating. I’m glad you have supports.

There was this girl I really liked for a long long time. I asked her out and with out a second to loose she said yes. She said I could trust her, she would never leave, and we would have a family one day. Then I came home on day and found she cheated on me with one of my best friends. Now every day I wake up thinking what did I do wrong and how much I want to kill my self. I lost both a friend and a lover that day.

"There is an older version of yourself who is proud you didn’t give up.

I know a lot of people on this sub are going through some really crappy times, and I feel you. I was there. Some days I go back there. 

There are gonna be some people who don’t want to hear this (I was one of them) but it’s the truth.

If you think that there is nothing to live for, you are wrong. There will be an older version of yourself who will want to tell you “I am so proud of you. You have gone through hell, but you didn’t give up. Just keep on fighting, you’re going to be so strong someday.”

I know I wish I could tell that to younger me. She struggled so much. She was all alone too. She didn’t have anyone to talk to, and she was losing her mind. She wanted to die. But she fought.

And without her, I wouldn’t be here today.

You do not have nothing. You have yourself. And you have power. You are in control of your life. You have the power to reach out and get help. If you don’t find it, your looking in the wrong places. I believe that you can fight. You are so strong.

They won’t be, they’d probably be devastated and hurt if you did. You’re not a burden on them.

This probably sounds like the typical story but I've never even really touched another non relative woman. I've struggled to make friends throughout school and even during work. I feel like I give off a very ""not okay"" energy. During any conversation my brain starts observing and imagining every scenario that can happen and when i talk i feel like i talk too fast (stumble on my own words) and give off the wrong emotion for the occasion. I'm very very shy and if i could I'd prefer not talking to people in general (which lowers my chances), but i feel so lonely to talk to and hold a woman that I like being with. Maybe i just wanna feel appreciated and attractive (and be fulfilled sexually). I tried installing many different dating apps and havent received 1 like in the past 4 months. I've never had a girl hit on me or ask me out either. I also dont feel like a loser in other aspects of my life (financial, education, health etc.)"	anabeluga19	post	21.84598985377747	male	White	0.9983503818511963	na	na	na	3	sad	failed

"I never had a boyfriend and feel like I'm smart 🧠
You know, being single is not that bad

Just don't be that single that you'll start finding others relationship better company then your own

BTW I'm 23
And I believe, I'm so shy to talk to any guy around
My friend are also single, I don't mind even if they're in relationship
And one thing that makes me little more aware is that my roommate is lesbian

I don't know, where do I talk about
I really want a relationship too but it's cool that I try to be myself and let me grow out my shy behaviour

Don't feel unattractive, you're just overthinking and super-conscious
I don't really find any guy that much unattractive and think that's why he don't have anyone and single 
So do my friends thinks

I know a girl group who gossip about things about junior and guys of our batch
Like literally comparing and ranking
And for seniors noone talks about because if they'll find out, it'll be really embarrassing, so only about seniors with very best friends

But honestly, I never seen a single girl who gossips about such things and ended up with same guy they were talking about

I don't really feel it matters, it's just a talking
I don't like it, because it's not worth of time
I hope you don't be affected by such things

I've seen my male friends talking about some girls are really fat and such things
I know, how it feels like

Anyways what I believe is that they're not really worth if they're always talking bullshit

Just give yourself time and live the single life to fullest and no one is unattractive
It's just a gossip about you, if you heard any
Don't believe it

You'll get a best girlfriend, who boost your confidence and then you'll find yourself really really good looking"	anabeluga19	reply	na	na	na	0.9983503818511963	weak	strong	no	na	sad	failed
It has already pass 5 years since that moment i realised i fell in love. Her smile, voice, sense of humour, appearance, attitude towards me... because of all this, I was like in paradise, it all will be so perfect, I couldn't imagine such. it's been 3 years since we broke up, but everyday several times a day I go to her page to find out how she is. sometimes it’s easier, sometimes it’s really bad, but during this time I still couldn’t get it out of my head for more than 2 week. I am absolutely resigned to the fact that she will never leave and I will have to live with it but at the same time I don’t give a damn about all the girls around except for the one who will never be with me again	Better-Copy9033	post	33.0270377031718	female	White	0.006311469245702028	na	na	na	3	sad	failed

"Jun 28th, 2023

When he initially told me we were eating dinner and he let it slip out. My heart literally fell to my stomach and i didn't really know how to react. He tried to laugh it off and say that he'll be fine but i can't stop thinking about it...
Just now, I was trying to fall asleep and I just burst out crying. My heart felt heavy and it was like all the memories I have with my dad came flooding back into my head and I couldn't handle the thought of him not being here anymore.

I'm 19, the eldest daughter, I have younger siblings who I essentially raised but that doesn't mean we don't need him you know?

What am I supposed to do with myself if he's not here anymore?

I have my whole life planned out, I want to get married, have kids and take my own little family to see the family that I grew with, to show them my mom and dad, my siblings, the house that I grew up in with them. But it won't mean anything if the one who built and breathed the house was no longer there.

I know it's a privilege to know how much time you have left with a loved one, I know a lot of people don't get that, but, I can't help but feel like it's not fair. I love my dad. Even though he was present but not really there in our lives (because he was constantly working and stressed about having enough money to give us a roof to live under and food on our plates), i love him, if anything, i love him even more for that.

I’m sorry for ever raising my voice at him, or ever getting annoyed when he sat around in my room too long because he just wanted to talk about nothing and everything all at the same time. Im sorry for being such a shitty daughter who thought her dad was irritating.
I promise to him that I will make these years the best he has ever lived, I will love him unconditionally and tell him that from time to time because god only knows how long you have left with those you love the most.

I love my old man, to the stars and back and I won't let him forget it.

Sincerely, 'daddy's little girl'."	krnatiny	post	30.160237891425286	female	White	0.004586643073707819	na	na	na	4	sad	failed

"In my opinion, you make the most of the time you have with him. You make memories and tell stories and take photos. Even if he is gone before you get a chance to show your own family your mom and dad, they can still experience him through you and your mom/siblings. One of my grandfathers passed away while I was little so I don’t really remember him, but I know so much about him because of stories my Nana, dad, and aunts/uncles have shared as I’ve grown up. 

Maybe ask him something that he’s always wanted to do and then make plans to make it happen. Is there somewhere he’s always wanted to go or he loved to go as a kid and hasn’t as an adult? That would be a great way to make some great memories. 

You can consider making videos of him answering questions. My sisters and I did this with my grandfather who passed a few years ago. We just sat down with him and recorded him telling us things like how he met grandma and his favorite memory as a child. He loved sharing the stories with us and it is really nice to know we can revisit those stores from his narrative whenever we want. 

Also keep in mind that life expectancies may go longer than a doctor predicts. My mom was given 2-5 years to live in 1991. She’s still kicking."	krnatiny	reply	na	na	na	0.004586643073707819	no	no	no	na	sad	failed

I feel like everyone around me just evolved while i stayed the same, i even got worse, i'm a 22 yo that right now practically has no life outside internet, i feel really grateful for my buddies online cause if it wasn't for them i would be in the most deep of the sh\*\*s, and i know it's just how we reflect only the good parts in social media, but i see how those persons that i used to call friends before right now are living their lifes, getting in another cities, studying careers, in concerts, with friends in parties, while i'm just a sad blob of fat and sadness sitting in a chair watching a computer, studying stuff that i feel has no future even if i'm passionate about it, i can't hang out with friends in real life anymore, never had a relationship and never felt that i was attractive enough for anybody, i have problems with money in my house, i always compare me to others and i just feel like the worst of the worst, it's like there's a tiny voice in my head that says that i'm just worthless, i have constant nightmares about just living and everything going wrong, i'm dependent and just a dumb idiot, with my friends i always try to smile but when they start talking about what they did, their jobs, their stories about just, living life at all, i just can't resist to feel left out, cause i don't have those stories, my life it's just doing the same thing over and over and over and i feel that everything that i'm doing it's just not enough and it's not as important as others.

i always wanted to be the support of my friends, and they try to help me with this situations cause even if it's against a screen, they're still loving friends, but i just feel so lonely if they aren't there.

&#x200B;

i don't know what to do, i'm just not prepared for the future, i'm just so scared, i try to be stoic cause i don't want my mother to know i'm like this, i feel like having to take therapy would just be a waste of money and a burden.

I know you feel like you’d be a burden or a waste of money but I really would recommend therapy. Maybe you could get it covered by the government, a company, your place of work or education? I completely understand the utter pain that that isolation inherently causes, I live it. I’ve struggled with it for so long and only recently have I maybe found a good treatment for me (DBT/DBT style treatment). There are so many therapeutic methods out there, I really suggest you give it a shot.

I have been watching YouTube every day doing nothing else, I proposed to myself since the beginning of the year to try and do sport in house as in my town there is no gym and I have been making progress every day. If there is something that passionate you learn more about it and make a living out of it.

"My gf and I used to sometimes discuss the future, at first I wanted no kids and no marriage but she did, I eventually came around and was only excited for our future together.

Then her mother dies. The world is cold and bleak to her, it already was but now moreso - she no longer wanted kids and marriage because her mum won't be around to help her through it.

As time goes on, she gets colder to me and I did my best to help her.

Eventually she brings up the future again and it leads to a near-break-up conversation which BROKE MY HEART, at least the foundations began to crumble.

I told her to wait to have this conversation after her 21st birthday as I had put so much time, effort and money into her party already and she deserves the best 21st ever as she's a wonderful person despite her constant attitude and how easy it is to anger her - especially recently.

So we waited and waited. Her party is 2 weeks away and my heart has fully shattered at this point, especially with her random bursts of aggression.

I make a stupid decision to meet a girl who I then slept with yesterday morning.

Gf sees the texts on my phone and we end up breaking up early.

My biggest regret is hurtinf such a wonderful, kind, helpful and generous person just because my mental health was bad and heart was broken.

I only had to wait 2 weeks until we broke up.

I didn't need to cheat.

Now I don't know what to do and my mind is flooded with thoughts about ceasing my own existence and I can't stop it.

Have you ever talked to anybody about this? I won’t make any assumptions but I do know that mental problems can alter our perceptions of others in ways that can make them seem more negative towards us. Either way, I think you should talk to somebody about this, it’s not a very happy way to live.	Apprehensive-Aerie52	reply	na	na	na	0.9994081258773804	weak	no	strong	na	sad	no prediction.

If you are here to talk me out of it, don't. Please don't waste your time on a lost cause. If you're here to ask why, don't. It doesn't matter. I don't need any help or anything to talk me out of it. I just want a swift end to it. That is all. I can't hang myself, i don't have a gun and I overall just need the easiest way out and at home painlessly.	idjdjebsjkdnsnd	post	17.572789703745737	male	White	0.9978576302528381	na	na	na	14	sad	failed

Here’s the truth, this is easily google-able info so the fact you’re posting this in a public forum like this means you don’t want to die, at least not fully, this is a shout into the void and your last grasp reaching out for a lifeboat. Im not here to talk you out of it because it’s your life, but it’s not all bad, but you have to chose to make it not bad, it’s not going to happen for you. When I was depressed and suicidal it felt like everything was happening TO me and AT me. I had to decide that I didn’t deserve to suffer, and actively chose happiness, I know it’s hard. Good luck on whatever your journey may be.	idjdjebsjkdnsnd	reply	na	na	na	0.9978576302528381	no	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.
There is no way to kill yourself painlessly, easily and quickly. And there is no 100% way to do it either. There’s always a high risk of agony if in the instance of death, or permanent injury and lot of fear and pain if you survive. If you try it, you will regret it the moment you start whatever method you’re thinking about, I can promise you that. You’re not a lost cause, there’s still a way out of this. I know how agonizing this can all be, but you can still make it out of this pain as long as you’re alive. Please call a hospital, clinic, doctor/therapist you know, or crisis line (you can also text some crisis lines I believe). It doesn’t have to be this way. Do you wanna talk about why you feel like this?	idjdjebsjkdnsnd	reply	na	na	na	0.9978576302528381	weak	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.
I’m so sorry you are this broken. Trust me, I understand. I don’t know what your situation is, but I promise there is something better. I don’t believe that you are a lost cause. I know how much life hurts. Trust me. But you have to change your perspective. I know you’re tired. I know you’re weary. I know that you feel like you can’t go on. But just think how much of an “f you” it would be to everything if you survived. Please pay attention. I’m not saying lived. I’m saying survived. They are two different things. But just because you are surviving now, doesn’t mean you won’t live in the future. I would strongly encourage you to call the suicide hotline and get help. Life can be so much better than it is now. Don’t worry about money, don’t worry about reputation. Your life is way more valuable than any of that. You said not to waste our time on a lost cause, but I don’t see this as a waste. I see it as the exact opposite. I see the time I am taking to write this as an important moment and as the best way I could be spending my time right now. And again. I don’t think you are a lost cause. Nobody is a lost cause. Everyone can change, everyone can get better, and most importantly, YOU are everyone. YOU can change your mind. YOU can get better. It’s not going to be easy. And it’s not going to be fun. But it is going to be worth it.	idjdjebsjkdnsnd	reply	na	na	na	0.9978576302528381	strong	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.

"I ll tell you something bro i know life is hard but its so beautiful when we feel full and positive so what is  happening is that our feeling change towards life depending on what we have and what we dont , secondly and without a hierarchical order ,  believe in god and try to read about islam , know that god exists and he will help you and he want you to be strong so never give up , 
thirdly know that the world is big bigger than what you think and remeber that you are seeing it with a pain right now and thats doesnt mean its the truth you reasons are real but that feeling about the whole world isnt real , 
fourthly you have to find your power and enjoy it and i dont mean ego here but your power of existance , your value just like when we listen to ""Techno"" and we feel that speeding power going into our veins . 
And still that doesnt mean that we have to fill always that up cuz life is ups and downs but what is life ?
Life is a gift its the existance into the infinity and you are a beautiful creature into a beautiful universe you have to realize that god create you and created this universe and he created everything very well , so you need to change some of your definitions about the world because we see things as how we define them into our minds . 
When we drink alchool we feel good because we dont think of any problems so its the same its the problems that makes you feel weak and make feel hate and feel giving up and things unworthy , but if you eliminate that and you will be left with the beauty of the enjoyment of life , and yes life isnt a total paradise but life needs us to be strong and life is also a jungle where we have to fight for what we want to get and we cant in a corner and blame it all , 
Feel your power believe in god and in yourself and realize the importance of your existance and enjoy it , we are created to live this life and to learn and to be strong ."	idjdjebsjkdnsnd	reply	na	na	na	0.9978576302528381	weak	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.

"You know that feeling when someone do things for you and only for you? Like cancel other plans to hang out with you, or randomly tell you he/she loves you, asking you out before you ask them out, text first, talk with you about their day and that kinda stuff, you know, being something special and different for someone? I haven't. I never had a relationship in my life, last time I felt I had a close friend was idk 5 6 years ago when I was 15 or so, last time someone told me she likes me (not like the loving i like you, like the guy she know i like you) was more than a year ago. I've been through total darkness for the past 9 - 10 months. Recently I found a new job but even that doesn't make me happy, I still feel empty, unimportant, unspecial. I feel ugly and unlikable cuz I think I don't look good enough to be loved. When I tried to vent to the girl that I thought might care a bit, all I felt was like she's just trying to end the convo, and the other times she straight up tells me to stop complaining, in fact everyone tells me that, its like I'm just saying what happened to me in the way home that day and everyone will be like ""stfu dude stop complaining nobody cares"".

"I know I'm kinda just throwing a pity party, but I can't help it. I've been expected to be perfect for so long and have abided by the saying my mother drilled into my head that if I'm not perfect, then I'm not good enough, but I'm done. I can't do this anymore. I don't want to die or anything, but I don't want to live like this anymore. I'm a minor, so I can't get out of here yet. I don't know what to do. I need my therapist back.

But anyways. I'm just hating myself right now because my mother still hasn't shown me any love after the years I've tried to be the perfect ""daughter"" (she refuses to acknowledge that I use they/them pronouns) for her and it's causing me issues with seeing how anyone loves me.

This is a real person btw: If you add a little bit of activity each day, dont go too fast, you will feel better, l like too run. Be proud of what u accomplish not mad at what u didn't. Life is too short for depression or anything else to consume ur life, u might be viewing life in a negative way, u wont fond happiness by doing that. Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, u can still talk to a therapist tho. Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible. Look up Bobby price guy health. U can’t end ur only life which is all u know by ending ur life. Don’t think mood swings last forever. Look for small thrills and the bigger ones will  come. Look up how to deal with Loneliness by dry creek ranger school. Suicide is a permanent fix to a temporary problem.	SadBoiEmporium	reply	na	na	na	0.9980846643447876	weak	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.
"I never should have drank alcohol or done drugs but I did. I can only describe the aftermath of my mistakes as a loss of my soul. My essence. My inner energy. Chi. Whatever you want to call it. 

When I was lost I didn't seek out a usual guide. A therapist or rehab or a priest or pastor. I tried to find a real witch. The sort you'd only ever read about from old medieval books. The kind that only lie. The sort that drip poison from their mouths to draw yours out, rather than treat your poison with a cure. I was really dark then, and it was a choice between potentially knowing my future and never knowing if it existed in the first place. 

 Without getting too detailed, within 24 hours of meeting that person it felt like I straight up died, and became a corpse. The only thing that helped was liquor or wine. I soon lost my fiance and it destroyed every part of me that made me human. But one thing stuck with me. It was a longshot but maybe it was for a reason.

Maybe I actually found the woman I had been waiting for, a while later. A really cool chick, super sensitive, and loving. It all worked out with what that witch told me, right? So it seemed possible. 

 Deep down inside I knew that witch was a liar, but I wanted to believe them, or maybe it was just a way of trying to rationalize the thoughts in my stupid caveman brain that didn't make sense. All I knew is, I wanted to be with this woman, long term, maybe forever. Because I was convinced that was what the witches symbology meant. I mean, after you lose everything it's pretty easy to find meaning in nothing.

 Months pass and at this point I couldn't stop drinking. Hospital trips. Breathing issues. Emotional disregulation. 

She left. My last hope. 
For fuck sake, I really am heartbroken. 
It's never going to get better, trust that. 

Anyways that's when my life changed. It's also why I have a week or so to find meaning in my mind before I get paid and really actually kill myself after I sort through my stuff. It isn't her fault, it's mine. I ruined her life, even if only temporarily. She found new love. I ruined my family. I ruined my future. Sobriety has only made it worse. And you know what? 

I tried killing myself before and I failed. I was secretly glad I failed, because I found someone later who actually cared.

 I won't make the same mistake twice, because guess what? I can't see my future anymore. There isn't a witch on my side. There isn't a woman I'll find. There is only pain, and it has driven me to the breaking point of my sanity. 

Biggest regret? 
Not buying a woman the ring she wanted. 
Not marrying that woman. 
And I never will. 
Because I hate myself that much. 

Bye, guys. 
6 days left to figure it out. 
Maybe 4-5, realistically. 

I don't want your attention. I just want you to know that there exists people like me. I used to be a really good man. I don't know what happened to me. But I can't live anymore as whoever I am inside. 

Life isn't cruel. 
People are. 
I was cruel."	hard_clicker	post	18.75295112154251	male	White	0.9976932406425476	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

Look bro.. escaping from temporary problems won't solve anything. Cuz literally every problem is temporary. When i tried to kill myself i found it useless because i didn't actually wanna die, i just wanted the problems to go away. I was losing friends & family and felt that the world is collapsing over me.

I am not as strong as I seem, I hurt. I hurt everyday that I wake up. Wether it be physical or emotional, I hurt. To have a pain that comes all day is draining. To stare down a barrel every night but can’t pull the trigger. Hurts. Nothing that I’ve done has helped my pain. Not pills, drinking, or even trying to buy happiness through shopping or expensive trips. You put others first but to no avail. Pain is what leaves the biggest mark. It’s also what creates the most suffering. Suffering wether by broken trust or a leg that’s never stopped throbbing. Happiness feels like a drug that only lasts for so long. When it starts to fade, is when you look for the next dose. Praying it will be soon but too often it isn’t soon enough. You stay your time by putting distractions before priorities. They start as small lies to keep you going but soon enough those lies have become a new life. Hard to escape, hard to resist. These new temptations have taken over. You try to escape, make a better life. Sooner or later, you’ve fallen back but further down then when you started. The ladder you once used to climb to happiness, burned by the desire to lie to yourself. You can run till your legs give out but darkness always fallows. You take comfort in the new found darkness. You make it your breath, your sight. It covers you like a moss, never to let go. Sometimes you see light, only to find it was your imagination. You betray yourself to people as happy but behind closed doors the mask fades, falls off. You stay up late during the dark hours so you may take peace in the night. Only to fight the light the next morning. The sun hits like a thousand knifes. You fight to wake up, knowing that the lies will continue. Once up, you find your mask praying it stays on when meeting friends or family. Knowing that if it fell off, all you would see is pity, sadness, a fake urge to help from those around. You make yourself pretend that you only have to lie for a couple hours, yet the mask you’ve chosen rarely comes off. Scared to show your real identity causes even more pain. The same pain that gave you the mask. You now welcome pain as an old friend, since you’ve become accustomed to him. He lurks, stalks, focuses on when you’re least likely to think of him. He pounces. Friends say they know pain, family says they’ve felt it. It’s not your pain they’ve felt. So nothing they say matters. At this point lies, big or small, ease the everyday from reality. You keep yourself busy trying to outrun your thoughts. They are too quick. You are caught in a trap that will never let go. They say you are to forgive yourself first, but where do you start. This is where the lies continue. Only here is where the once hope of becoming better fades from the once lit tunnel that shined so bright. To know how it feels to love with your whole heart, only to get nothing in return. Hurts. Love is another drug. Feels mystical for how rare it is. Unconditional love. Extinct. Extinct in a world where everything is traded and judged. These are the thoughts of a broken man.	Ok-Independent-6953	post	22.044036812004872	male	White	0.8113295435905457	na	na	na	5	sad	failed

This is probably gonna sound like one of those really fucking annoying posts but, it's my fucking annoying post now :(

With my 25th birthday approaching around the corner, the niggling feeling of lonliness has really started to bite. I have had this feeling through various parts of my life but now it just feels different. You probably see a lot of these posts. I guess we all yearn for company, because company, good company where you truly feel wanted is so essential.

I'll be 30 soon. Just as being 20 seems like yesterday. I hope it is different then. It will be, I won't wallow in my misery.

I worked hard through high school, got into a decent degree and then have had a solid job that pays well. And it is rewarding at times. I am not good at as I would like to be, but it pays the bills. I go to the gym, never got the progress I had hoped for given how much time I have spent in that place. I don't like my body. I am shorter than average but not short enough to be regarded as a short bloke. I am not sure how good looking I am. Sometimes I look at myself and think I look good but the reaction from other people does not really tell me either way. I don't know if I am on the spectrum or just bad socially. I have really good interactions with people where I think I am okay but other times I just feel like the most awkward cunt out there.

I have a lot of regrets. I missed out on a lot of things in high school, then in uni and now in my adult life. I regret not changing the things that I could have changed. I am probably missing out on living life fully now that I think about all the regrets. It would be nice to have a group of close friends. I have 2 close-ish friends; I end up making plans most of the times; they do reciprocate sometimes. I wish they felt as close to me as I to them.

I have never been with someone who has romantically loved me. I went on two dates with someone when I was 19. The next time I was on a date was with someone was last year, I was desperate so I went out with them but I was never really attracted to them. So, that's what, three dates in my life. I have gone out with mates to clubs and stuff 20 odds times over the last 2 years with no luck. Never had any success with the dating apps.

I don't think I am unloved. My parents love me but they live far away from where I am.

I guess romantic love is different, I probably need some of that. Maybe I have it good, I don't know. But why am I so miserable and lonely?"	Ubermensch42786	post	23.883807263451217	male	White	0.9933798313140869	na	na	na	8	sad	failed

"As someone who has apparently lived a very similar life (lost my early 20s experience for different reasons) the biggest thing is to just stop caring about needing that relationship...look instead to become happy with yourself, treat yourself well, plan for what you want to do.

I agree with what you are saying, a relationship isn't going to fix anything if I am broken. The problem is I am just not happy with who I am. I hate the way I think about things. I don't like certain aspects of my personality. I don't like the way I look. I am working towards improving some of these things. I know I will get better and feel better but I feel like I will never be able to be the ideal person as I see it.	Ubermensch42786	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9933798313140869	weak	strong	no	na	sad	failed
Hey, thanks for your advice. I am going to the gym. I can't get back to sport, I have previous knee injuries (requiring surgery) and shoulder injuries. Can't play most of the sports I did growing up.

Look, God might have a plan for me. What ever it is I am not liking it. Not out of arrogance or that I know better than him.

"Ah ""the IDEAL"" person, modern society has trained us (especially millennials and gen Z) that we can be as perfect as we want to be with effort...its not true, we grew up with parents who had little to no understanding or care about mental health unless you're lucky enough to have a health professional as a parent. 

Best advice I can offer is find/acquire an A3 piece of paper and a pack of markers, start a brainstorm with ""me"" at the centre, start putting down what you are unhappy with/would like to improve...from there go one by one and seriously think about what would make you happier/more satisfied with your life and make branches as needed for what you want to work on.

Best advice I can give to you sorry, try it out and let me know how you go 😊"	Ubermensch42786	reply	na	na	na	0.9933798313140869	no	strong	no	na	sad	failed
"I literally don’t know what to do , I have no car and don’t want to work around people or have to sell anything , I like being around people but not for work . I don’t trust coworker’s due to being sa at two jobs and I am paranoid around working with men I get hit on all the time and it’s risky because I uber places. I make money online but I need pay stubs . Any ideas 🫠 was thinking about going in on a vending machine with my friend and getting the snacks with my ebt card but I need money to start that. I’m wanting to go to school for sonography and do X-rays I’ve always loved science and I’m sure I can get financial aid but I’ll need a car to get to school and my laptop fixed. I spent my whole life depressed and sad about my past and I’ve mentally changed completely and I am happy and have good people around me now . I just need a stable foundation to build on but it feels impossible when im teaching myself everything. I’ve had 22 jobs and quit or get fired from every job just due to a lack of motivation. My family and everyone has taught me what not to do but not how to grow and build. My dad died and was an alcoholic my biological mom was an addict and alot of her family members have history of sa . My adopted mother was strict on me my entire life and when I turned 18 just stopped and I don’t know how to do anything in the real world. She also likes humiliating me in public . My adopted mom was strict on me my whole life never let me sleep over anyone’s house and took my phone every night and went through it till mid 17. It’s strange because a lot of the times I bring up the things she does she acts clueless or like she doesn’t remember. The church I went to would do weird things like me falling asleep the pastor made me stand in front of the church. My mom would talk about me during the word. She would make me go to church like 4 times a week she has dragged me down the hall by my hood one day because I refused to go to church. Once my mom found out a boy had done stuff with me but really groomed me when I was like 12 and she made me sign a contract and threaten to send me to a Christian school and her and the pastor made me read books about why stuff was bad. I use to get in trouble and yelled at and spanked because I couldn’t stay still and I said I couldn’t and they said it was satan. And then they found out I had adhd they apologized for it. People would hang out with me and my mom would blast Christian music and scream to god and embarrass me for some reason. She made me go to a school far from my house and I’d have to sit in an office for 2-4 extra hours everyday for 3 years and my senior year I had double early release so I spent over $600 on Ubers home. Like one time I asked her to take me to a job interview and she just wouldn’t do it just because she didn’t feel like it but I feel like if I had a daughter I would do anything to help her. And the other pastor for church has a car but my mom for over 10 years has picked her up and took her to church because she’s convinced it’s a service to God. We go places in public and she says out loud you can’t afford this or I don’t have money loud in public. She is a hoarder and collects things and it’s been like this for years and every time I say she’s messy or needs to clean she gets mad at me and won’t admit she’s a hoarder. I’ve cleaned up areas in the house and she gets upset and then a couple days later apologizes. When I lost my virginity she was like everyone is going to think you’re a w slur and I was like you’re calling me a w slur  and she was like no I’m saying everyone is going to think you are one. She always gaslights me and makes me feel like I’m wrong for being upset. She use to say stuff to me like here comes the boobs and like say she felt like she was sitting next to a pregnant person and not to be friends with gays and Muslims and all types of crazy things. She would throw away my clothes and posters without me knowing I would find it in the trash. She wouldn’t let me play basketball because she said I would turn into a lesbian.She has hundreds of books and has been a psychologist for over 25 years . When I turned 18 she stopped caring and I had to beg her to call
Me she would go weeks without talking to me and I had no clue how to be in the real world. I was very socially awkward and started dabbling into substances to be outgoing and feel comfortable and it caused permanent damage to my brain and memory. I eat very healthy now and have a strict diet and have good friends in my life that teach me things but it’s hard building on a broken foundation. I know how to talk to my mom now and when she starts being mean I just ask her to stop and tell her I don’t want to argue with her. It feels like she hates me there has been times where I’ve been stuck places and she didn’t help and she sees me struggling and refuses to offer a helping hand. This one time she lost my birth certificate and social and she was like if it’s not there then that means I lost it ? But she was keeping up with it it’s like she can’t take accountability for stuff ? And she had shut down my bank account that was attached to hers and didn’t tell me for some reason ? I don’t understand how she feels or why she feels the way she does towards me. I feel like I’ll never be enough for her I want her to like me I want to get over my mommy issues. I feel so bad for her because she use to live in california and be free spirited and travel and she’s just stuck in the hoarded house with our dying dog in the same routine. I really just want to get rich so I can fly her around and let her live out the life she feels like she’s losing. My best friend died around 2 years ago and I have had problems with hoarding and alcohol and substances. The substances I’ve used caused permanent damage. I use to have extremely bad acne and never took care of myself. I am trying to teach myself how to be in a relationship after hating who I was for so long time. The guy I’m talking to has a lot going for him and is talented in about everything and is 20 and I’m 21 . He’s so nice to me and it feels like I’m not worthy or it’s all an act. I don’t have enough money to go to school and do the career I want and I just moved back into my moms and I’m trying to get a job . He’s always complimenting me and I’m starting to allow myself to be emotionally available. I honestly feel that having an only fans and making money online through married men has also caused very deep trust issues. I’ve made thousands from it but I do not trust nor want to allow myself to be loved. Any way to allow myself to be loved ?"

 I would say i have a good life that many people would want and i feel selfish for wanting to kill myself but since past few years all i can think about is how not good enought I'm or how bad am I gonna mess up in the future I'm a burden to everyone, i cut off people that were my friends and i cut off even my love interest because it's like i have infinite personalities and no personality at all at the same time one time i feel like the thing am doing is right and the other that it's not and i don't know what to do.my mother had history with mentall illness so maybe it's just how l'm too but i hate every second of it it's like i was watching myself ruin everything from the back seat of my mind, i try to take walks clean and take care of myself but it's so much guilt to bear that i hurt people when i cut them off and that i lied to them I'm such a horrible person and i don't even know who I'm 	deepeststranding	post	19.381887268078216	female	White	0.9991664886474609	na	na	na	4	sad	failed

"Going to be honest. It sound very similar to me. I would switch up my personality on the flip of a coin.  I could be happy, sad and angry all in such quick succession. 

Eventually I had enough of feeling that way. I went and saw a doctor, went through a bunch of tests and was eventually diagnosed with BPD (Borderline personality disorder).

Sounds scary at first ""I've got a mental illness"" but honestly this day in age, it's more common than you thing for sure. 

The ideas you have in your head stem only from you. No one else is putting those thoughts there. It is a sole creation of your perspective of yourself. 

Try to make small positive changes to your perception and I promise you the idea and view of yourself will change. That's the way I managed to deal with the issues I had revolving around my mindset and feelings of worthlessness and anxiety. 

The thing you have to remember and I really want you to take this bit in. Some people feel hopeless for a day, some for a week, and some for years. No matter how long it takes the sun will always rise, followed by the moon. The days keep going and time keeps ticking. Nothing in the natural cycle changes. The only things we can change is what we add to the world. Make positive changes and positivity will return to you. That I promise."	deepeststranding	reply	na	na	na	0.9991664886474609	no	strong	no	na	sad	failed

Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, u can still talk to a therapist tho. Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible.

"I don't even know where to start. 

Between years of mental illness struggles with BPD, Anxiety, Depression and OCD and having not one but 2 long term relationships fail because I can't control emotions, thoughts or my stupid obsessive behaviors. 

I don't blame either of them, one relationship was just over 6 years, the other that literally ended 7 days ago was almost 4, I'm very much over the first. But this one hurts, a lot. 

I thought this was it you know? Plans of kids, marriage. We already own a place together, she's moved out with her friend. But the house is still full of memories. I know it's my fault, I've neglected, pushed and driven her away, again I don't blame her at all, in hindsight things would have always been different. But that's me, I have a self destructive nature that kills anything that makes me even moderately happy. 

I don't know why I'm writing this, nothing will come of it. I'm taking meds, having therapy, hypnosis, spiritual council. I've tried it all, done it all and will try anything else just to feel normal, or as close to normal can be. 

I don't know where to turn, I hate being alone. But I can't do another start over, explain all the issues and become comfortable opening my heart to someone again just to ruin it and hurt all over. Shit I don't even know if I'll make it this far or not this time. Thoughts come and go of you know what I mean? Just wish someone would invent a time machine already so I can sort my shit out.

"its so sad when you see something deteriorate overtime and you’re fully aware that it is happening but you’re just lost on what you need to do in the effort to bring it back…

i know i have flaws and lapses but sometimes im just so sososo stupid for falling too deep into people who do not deserve it and what can i do?  im a hopeless romantic afterall and im just stuck here thinking about the person every single day fully knowing that there is no chance to get everything even a single drop back…
 
i thought cutting communication on everything related to the person will solve it but it just made my racing thoughts and sleep worse… ( and i even tried to contact back even tho i started it) i dont know what to do now its been months already and im still stuck in the same loop everyday. i sure do hope this doesnt last long bc theres really no one that i can talk to right now

i hope my english was ok as my brain is not optimal right now, thanks"	Alternative-Host7429	post	20.808492548052648	female	White	0.9993546605110168	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

Everything comes around full circle, sometimes it takes a while. But it does, every time. You, though, do not want to live with such hate in your heart. You do not want to me them take the good from you, the love. If you do that, you will meet the same fate in the end as they will. You are worth more than they are, it just hasn’t been noticed yet.

This is a real person btw: If you add a little bit of activity each day, dont go too fast, you will feel better, l like too run. Be proud of what u accomplish not mad at what u didn't. Life is too short for depression or anything else to consume ur life, u might be viewing life in a negative way, u wont fond happiness by doing that. Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, u can still talk to a therapist tho. Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible. Look up Bobby price guy health. U can’t end ur only life which is all u know by ending ur life. Don’t think mood swings last forever. Look for small thrills and the bigger ones will  come.

I know that you're hurting. | know that you're sad

your vices and that sometimes you feel like the
whole entire world is against you. | know you feel
like you're alone, lost in the sadness, misery, and
chaos of heartbreak.

Well, I'm here to remind you that you are never

I’ve been in love, or what I think is love. I still am but she said no. Me and my cousin are close friends and about 3 years ago, I met her friend. She’s the most real and genuine person I’ve ever met, beautiful and funny, her laugh and her smile. Its really her sense of humor that gets me. I told her how I felt after years of development and she said it wouldn’t work. Im too young and too close with my cousin (her best friend), plus she said all she does is break hearts. I saw her today going out to a bar and it feels like a wound opened. As i’m writing this, and over the couple days of me confessing, I’ve realized that I am going on my own personal adventure, joining the military. There are many things happening right now and its all so confusing. Im just sad, really sad. I hope I can be with her but I don’t know if Ill get over it or still be attached. Im just sad, really sad. So sad Im trying to vent on a fucking sub reddit.	WhenTheTreesTalk	post	34.32588340762911	female	White	0.9975511431694031	na	na	na	2	sad	no prediction.

"our relationship ended 2 years ago (yeah kind of a long time actually), it left me really depressed, which i still am, and suicidal for months. every time her name came up in conversation i'd start to feel really anxious and my heart would just start to race. last month, i was invited to the birthday party of a friend of mine and she was invited to, i thought i was finally over it and decided to go to the party, but when the day came i had panic attacks every two seconds and couldn't even concentrate on anything.

so today, i woke up and realized she had sent me a friend solicitation and wanted to talk with me. i asked her why she sent the solicitation and she said that her and some friends were talking about some people and my name came up in conversation, so she wanted to talk to me after all that time. 

we chatted a little and she said that she was sorry, and she would be ok if i removed/blocked her as friends, since she knows seeing her makes me feel bad.

i know its kind of a dumb situation, but i don't know what to do, a part of me wants to get closure, talk about why our relationship ended and what made me feel that bad, but i cant gather the courage to do that. another part wants to just remove and forget about her, but i think that would be just running away from the problem."	bobrinha47	post	28.85187724300724	male	White	0.9980061650276184	na	na	na	4	sad	no prediction.

"I have no clue of the conditions of your past relationship, or the grounds on which you guys decided to break up, but best case considered it sounds like she’s being at least a little empathetic and reasonable. Then again, if it’s something bad *she* did to you that caused your uneasiness in being around her then that wouldn’t really matter much. Her awareness of your mentality might indicate she *knows* she was in the wrong, but then again I could only guess.

Have you guys talked it over before, if it’s something you’re comfortable with? When you broke up, was it mutual, or something else?

I get unfriending and blocking someone who makes you uncomfortable but maybe if she didn’t do something like irredeemable you guys could talk and try to understand each other.

"First time posting, long time sad. I struggle so much socially because of it. I was having an ok year. Had a position where I was able to mask my sad (plus social anxiety and OCD, yay me) pretty well and I was thankful for where I was. My employer decided that the position needed to be bilingual and I'm not so adios to me. I was reassigned elsewhere and it's awful. Everyday I feel even worse somehow. It's so hard to fabricate an entire version of yourself to present to others just to get through the day. Exhausting. I'm constantly on the verge of wanting to cry or vomit. I spend every available minute now lost in trying to find something else and I'm getting nowhere. I have a degree in a creative profession that I have the skills and equipment for and could make money with and would love to do, but I can't because the thought of interacting with people or someone being unhappy with my work shuts me down before I even get started. So I'm feeling sad about that too like you can't even do that what's wrong with you? Simultaneously, because I'm already sad I'm letting things in my marriage get to me and my husband isn't exactly the most sympathetic about the job situation anyways... ""It's work... just go..."" Awesome now I'm a baby too. He and I are fighting a lot. We had been doing really good when I was happy in this position at work but now that I'm struggling he and I are regressing a lot too. I mean this is a quick version there's so much more to it but I definitely feel like I'm spiraling to a  mindset of ""what if I just didn't have to deal with any of this?"". I've always kind of thought about it but always told myself I could never do it but I'm starting to feel like... you know what... maybe I could. I just needed to vent somewhere with people who may understand."	AmethystAstronaut	post	22.849878741860923	female	White	0.9992684721946716	na	na	na	2	sad	failed

"Oh no, I'm sorry to hear you're dealing with so much all at once! I remember a few years back when I was promoted away from my happy position, to a different area where I was miserable and underneath a hateful, toxic manager who ripped papers out of my hands and threw temper tantrums on the daily. It was so nasty, like you, I spent every waking moment looking for another job - and I left that company as soon as I found one. Even despite a paycut, I am MUCH happier today than I was. I know it SUUUCKS right now for you, dear, but you'll be using that shitty feeling to scrabble around and find some other place where you will be happier.   


Yeah, I have an art degree too that i don't use in my work field... it helps me make friends though. Wanna picture? Hah, I mean, they taught me how to make beautiful portraits in charcoal and that's all I focused on, no museums are hiring mediocre drawers though. ;P Once you get the work situation stabilized, if you wanna peek at your creative outlets when you don't have a boulder on your shoulders, and see what you can do - I bet you can work something out that'll make you happier and use your creativity to bring something of yourself into the world!

Hard story to say, thing is I loved her and I still love her, we met a year before graduating high school, at that moment everything was upside down, I wanted to find my shitty inmature ass into something useful for everybody, my parents didn’t give me love so I tried to search for it everywhere else, Im not that attractive, I was sure at that moment nobody would love me, then her came to my life, just to be a person that helped me get through everything for four years. She was my way to fight, she was everything to me. And she was to me. There was even a pact that if she died I would die with her and viceversa. Rn it sounds like a pretty bad idea. Everything started to go down when I asked her if I could go to her house a friday afternoon after my university classes, we used to get along together a long day from morning to evening so I thought everything would be ok. But then she told me not to go, this was like an stab behind my back, we promised each other to be always for the other one if something happened. I always was there for her, I saw her dad, her aunt, and her dog dead in front of my eyes. Always there for her, I didn’t even mind exams or something like that, just to be with her. Happened one time, everybody told me I needed a psychologist, feeling sad was worse everyday, I cut myself a few times waiting for a reality hit into my head. Some time ago she told me we would be a great couple, we started kissing, she was my first everything. Gotta say I really wanted to live my life with her. Just have each other into an apartment and just hug sometimes when we needed. She told me to find new friends because she thought she was leaving the country soon and she would not be for me. I saw her as she was tired of me and she wanted to leave. I started to take toxic reactions to her. I hated every second she told me she was going out with a guy because she stopped giving us the time we had because of that. She had time for those guys but not for me who was there for her at every single minute she needed me. I needed her help. Had to accept a shitty job at a shitty startup for a shitty payment because my family was not that good financially. She was not there. The most ungrateful reaction I’ve ever seen. Anyway I wanted to still be with her. Then fight started, we both cried, we both did everything in anger moments. Everything went to the toilet, now I want to kms everytime I remember what could have been. Im still here for you, even if you “let go”. I am sincere when I say, Ive never meant to say that. You are not stupid. That was only a way to open up the relation a little bit more. Cannot fight this anymore.

Oh I hate when people get mad at me for honest mistakes. It either pisses me off, or makes me feel down in teh dumps like yourself! But his accusations and the way he chose to express his feelings was totally unfair... His reaction is more about him and his feelings of insecurity than it is about you or your actions. You have been faithful and made an honest mistake! Your worth as a wife and as a person does not depend on him being upset with you! Apologizing and acknowledging your part in the miscommunication shows your willingness to make things right. His feelings of insecurity aren't actually your responsibility to manage, thats up to him to trust you and to communicate his feelings in a healthier way. Don't let this incident shake your self-confidence!	squeakybeeperbeepn	reply	na	na	na	0.9989036321640015	weak	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.
Oh he's cheating on you. See my wife use to do the same thing as your husband and then I found out she was the one cheating. One guy she cheated on me with, she was in a 2 year relationship with.

Well, you know what they say, guilty dog barks first. Usually, when someone is acting petty,jealous,and accusing their partner of cheating (without proof or cause to) it's because they are doing it themselves and are either trying to deflect blame off themselves or they think since they are their partner must be too. So, yeah. How often does he make accusations like this?	squeakybeeperbeepn	reply	na	na	na	0.9989036321640015	no	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.

I’m not sure, I think he’s got some serious self loathing issues and is scared to lose me to some imaginary guy but I feel so hopeless from constantly working so hard to get this person I love to trust and love me the way I do him.

Every few months he gets weird and acts like I’m stepping out, despite me working 12 hour shifts and spending literally the rest of the time im off with him when he’s home. His paranoia got weirder after we got a house and had ring cameras installed. Now he can see when I go out to run errands when he’s at work and if I don’t tell him “I’m going to go get groceries” within like an hour he calls me and says I’m “hiding something”	squeakybeeperbeepn	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9989036321640015	no	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.
See! That right there, what you said. It's hard work getting the person you love to love and trust you the way you love and trust him. Lovin' and trusting someone is so easy. It shouldn't ever be hard work. The moment it becomes hard that means their hiding something or hiding someone they don't want you to know about. Not only have I been there before but I had to walk away from it. I'm telling you I see the signs in you.

"I had an ex like this (he became abusive btw, one of the many reasons he's an ex). If I was gone to the store too long (pretty cell phones everywhere,they were very expensive) gone anywhere too long really, then I was out cheating. Didn't matter I came home with groceries or baskets of laundry done. I HAD to be cheating. Didn't matter I was pregnant, I MUST be cheating because I was gone too long/he didn't know where I was/ etc etc. Always some stupid reason. Found out after I threw him out HE was cheating on ME. A lot. Therefore, I must have been too! You DO NOT have to tolerate being treated like this! You ABSOLUTELY deserve better! If I had to guess, I'm willing to bet when he gets angry like this he berates you, tears down your self esteem, calls you names, puts you down, finds some way to insinuate you won't find anyone else better than him/loves you as much as he does/does as much for you/works as hard/cares enough to want to know where you are 24/7! Did I miss anything? They eventually move on to physical violence when they're like that and of course it's your fault for MAKING them hit you. They're always sorry but it wouldn't have happened if you just hadn't done whatever it is they've decided you did. My ex absolutely would have wanted me to send pictures proving where I was and who I was with if smart phones had existed then. He'd have definitely been the ""send a pic holding up 2 fingers"" or ""video chat me and show me who is around"" type. That is abuse, you DO NOT have to deal with it.

Well in my last post about a couple months ago I have went into a deep depression with a girl who did not like or care for me at the time I also mentioned my best friend who has liked her after he knew I was madly in love with her we have graduated and life has had a rise for me but somthing struck me which made me think almost every night about. It all started at my friends house we were walking and talking about girls like all teenage boys and at one point my friend bring out “oh yah you know that girl she dating your friend “after that I came into a thing I don’t know how to explain it I was sad and mad and a little bit nauseous.Anyways I’ve been thinking about this moment then text my friend who is supposedly dating this girl I ask him “you dating her “he said yes and the same thing happend to me it’s just I feel betrayed that my best friend could do this to me and this is the second time he done it .People tell me to stop being friends with him but the problem is I’m using his Spotify premium and I do t want that taken away ,but all jokes aside i don’t know what to do I’m sad mad and confused.

My wife of 9 years told me she wants a divorce. I can't believe it. I love her. I would do anything for her. She was talking to another man  didn't do anything with him, but she realized she wanted something different in life, something new. It feels like a mid life crisis, but I'm left here trying to pick up the pieces of myself. I feel alone. I am alone. The only person I loved more the I can explain is over me. I'm crushed and I can't stop crying. I wanted to grow old with her and see our grandkids together. Now I don't know what to do.  I want to just jump off a bridge and call it quits. I won't, but I want to. All my hobbies are meaningless. I have no distractions, I'm just sad and lonely. I have to start over, but I don't know how to after what happened. The love of my life is sick of me, and I don't know who I am anymore. I want to feel anything else.	jonnypoop2	post	25.168487593842578	male	White	0.998914361000061	na	na	na	1	sad	failed

"Although this sub is called ""sad"", many comments are so positive, I just love that. That's what I'm looking for here. 

My self-esteem is so low lately, plus my loud overthinking, they destroy me. It's wonderful when I'm happy or my mind is in calm; nothing unnecessary hurts and I can do whatever I feel I want to do. But when the storm that the overthinking represents arrives,  the world becomes dark. Nothing makes me feel good, I feel that I annoy people (I even though that I annoy things!), the constant feeling inside my body remembering me that I'm sad, and I won't get better because I'm not good enough. Thoughts far away from reality.

"Please if there’s anyone out there who would be willing to listen to my story while I’m still here please do. Here goes.

Moved out of my childhood home in my early 20s to get married and live with my spouse in his city due to his new job. Left NYC behind and said hello to the south. Holistically, this place is pretty awesome. I like it. 

Two months after the move, my dad dies. I gain a hundred fucking pounds and become a raging alcoholic. Stop sleeping with my husband. Find out he’s sleeping around to compensate. Life’s a fucking mess. By December of 2022 I am legally separated. Husband comes back, then leaves again for good in March 2023. Now I am single, and lo and behold I am also (as mentioned already), fat and an alcoholic. Great. Definitely going to make it big in the local dating scene(sarcasm)! The separation in its early months literally damn near kills me. Was losing days at a time because I’d just drink until I was physically too fucked to get more even tho I wanted more. Just wanted to end it all and not feel it. Funny, that’s actually how my dad killed himself. 

Out of what feels like nowhere, somebody I’ve seen for years but never thought of in a romantic sense, becomes somebody special to me. Man I am freaking tf out. Who would ever want to date someone like me? I’m huge man, I really am. I’ve got a good heart, always have. But me? I am definitely not nearly as good looking (anymore) as he still is. There’s no way. Run. Run before you damn near die a second time, I’m thinking to myself.

Fast forward to today. We’ve been together for a year now. Just had our anniversary last weekend actually. We have most certainly had some serious ups and downs in the past year but man, I am TRYING with every inch of me and every fiber of my being to improve myself as a means of growing within the relationship. Trying not to be an alcoholic, trying to lose weight, trying to improve my mental health. I deserve to live a life of better quality than I currently have. 

It’s so fucking hard. Man it’s so fucking hard. But I get up every day and at least try because that man deserves a partner who gives as much as he does, who learns to adapt for the betterment of themselves and subsequently ends up being a better partner.

I try and try. And some days I feel like it’s never going to be enough. I’m never going to lose the weight or drink in healthy amounts. I’m never going to advance in the workplace. I’ll never be a good enough partner. I’m going to spend the rest of my life alone because trust me, my unintended mediocrity is going to send this man running for the hills. 

All this to say, I’m sorry to everyone I’ve ever let down over the years. Especially my partner.  I’m going to miss you so much."	Alarming-Balance7728	post	19.229422073636012	male	White	0.006194422487169504	na	na	na	3	sad	failed

I’m 16f now and i’ve struggled with depression for as long as i can remember. But every year I feel worst and worst to the point now that for the last year I’ve been unable to feel any emotion. I’ve got a great life, a loving boyfriend, a great family, good grades and literally everything I could ask for. But despite all this I still feel emotionless and like I don’t want to be here, i’m currently on holiday and I just feel like spending it all in bed rather than actually going out and enjoying myself. I know people always say it gets better but for as long as i’ve known it’s only ever got worst and worst and I can’t see it getting any better considering I’ve tried everything. For the last year i’ve waited for a psychiatrist despite being supposedly high risk and at the top of the list but to be honest i’ve had therapy since i was 8 and i never really felt like it helped because i always struggled to convey my emotions and when I did i’d get the typical response of finding a hobby - which even when i did it never made me feel any better. I feel like i’m at a dead end in my life and I really don’t know what to do, I really don’t want to die but it just feels like i’m at a dead end in life and I’m just simply waiting until I do pass away.

"First off, I'm only talking about personal experience and I'm NOT a psychologist or anything even close to similar.

I can definitely relate with what you're feeling right now. My advice would be that time will make things better here. I know it's not what you expected, but experience is the most efficient teacher, albeit the cruelest one as well. This thing you feel right now WILL go away with time, trust me. To get through it, I'd find something to distract yourself while you're at it. For me, it was writing and music, maybe some videogames as well. Finding someone to talk to also helped me a lot, since I felt incredibly isolated with my ""friends"".   
Just know that it will go away and that you'll see things much clearer when it ends (which it will). I'd say writing, even something like a ""venting journal"" would let you calm down a bit in your hardest moments. I could get into why us humans aren't really built for sustained periods of happiness, but this would become a bible at that point. Just know that if you need to vent, my DMs are open and I'm 15M.

"I've been struggling for many years, but recently I've seemed to hit a new low...I started a new medication and scheduled an appointment to start therapy again, but I just don't know what I'm doing. Everyone tells me to have patience, to wait and things will get better, but how can they say that when I'm 20 now and they've been saying the same thing for eight years? It's nighttime now and I'm just so...sad. I just want to cry, and nothing's even happening. I feel so unstable, and yet not unstable enough. I want to die. I don't want to be here anymore, it's miserable. I have no future in sight and everyday just feels harder. But for some reason I can't...make myself let go.

Recently I posted to the suicidewatch subreddit, which I've done a few times, but this was the first time my post caused the mods to reach out due to concern, which just made it all...so much more real.

I (18F) have a grandma (89F). For context, she is your classic southern granny, she loved to bake, badass, and sweet towards the grandchildren. I live very close to her so me and her visit each other constantly. Let’s just say I am very close to her. Fast forward to last week, she was put on a low sodium diet to help her blood pressure, but she was too low on sodium, and that led to her having a terrible leg cramp. She took the ambulance and is in the hospital to recover from her injury. Yes it does sound minor, but when you are old and barely use your legs, it is extremely painful. We had to give her muscle relaxers which has led her to be delusional and out of it. She is begging to go home, but we can’t since she can’t even get up to use the bathroom. The only place my grandmother feels happy is in her home. We are trying to raise her sodium levels so she can go to a rehab facility so she can learn to use her legs again. Seeing my grandmother in such a dementia like state is killing me on the inside. My first word was meemaw. She is my first word. It’s just heartbreaking that I can’t do anything to ease her pain. I visit her often in the hospital, but whenever I leave, I just feel this sort of sadness that she is so sad in that hospital.. I hope she recovers soon and returns back to the granny I knew.

"F(20). It's summer vacation, don't have anything to do, I've always have a good relationship with my family, I live with them. Have good friends, boyfriend too. 

But, I'm sad.

Have a continuous depressive feeling. My thoughts are: ""what should I do to be more productive?"" ""How can I enjoy my time?"" ""I really don't need to do anything productive, so, what do I do then?"".

My biggest problem is definitely overthinking. My mind is lately never in peace, and every interaction of myself with anything, anyone, makes me think about it. 

Tbh, the interactions that make me overthink the most are with my boyfriend. He's a bit of a difficult person because he's rude sometimes but, it's just his way of being, he tells me. And it's true, he acts like that with his family. He's not violent or anything like that, but his way of talk, answering, can be annoying sometimes. 

So yeah I've been thinking I should break out with him. But, what if that's not really my problem? I don't want to mess it up."	Brief-Strawberry-577	post	24.572815005839164	female	White	0.9981499910354614	na	na	na	3	sad	failed

"While I was waiting to check out, this 8-12 year old boy kept staring at me. He looked me up and down and smiled. He whispered to his older brother and they both turned around, smiling, making eye contact with me. They both began to laugh. Was it my hair? My face? I didn't cry. I wanted to. But I didn't. 

I know the whole “WhAt If tHey WeRenT tAlKinG abOuT yOu?” Thing. But it was obviously about me. They were less than 2 feet away. I was the only person around. Unless there was a big fat dinosaur behind me, it was about me.

"You have an alternative look.  You are pretty, I think.  I certainly wouldn't call you obese, not by a long shot. Lots of people like different body types - you're good the way you are, although it's always a good idea to exercise too.  
When you look different, like you do, kids are bound to make fun of you.  Like the other commentor said, kids are kind of dumb.  Just try to put it behind you.  
I am sorry, I was just curious as to what you looked like, so I looked at your profile and saw you holding a chicken or something.   
I'm not the kind of person to lie to random strangers.  You're pretty.  Don't beat yourself up. Try to surround yourself with positive people.  Just my 2 cents. Wish you luck.

Hi. I’m sorry those kids were hurtful. It’s sad to see a new generation of people being mean because of learned behavior from parents, probably. I had a similar experience today because I could feel a few older women give me snake eyes at the mall. It was pretty obvious. I don’t feel attractive either and recently had a weight gain. I’ve been examining why it bothers me so much. We all want to feel our best and improve, but I hate it feels I’m worthless as a human based on my looks. I am working to loose the weight and feel attractive  again, yet I despise feeling that my entire identity and worth is a stake here.  The past year I’ve been trying to take ownership of how I feel about my body and face. Like, “I’m not attractive today. And that’s ok. I don’t have to be.” For me, there is something powerful and freeing in letting go of the need to feel attractive. We don’t owe that to anyone. Wishing you the best. 💜	moralmeemo	reply	na	na	na	0.017529714852571487	strong	strong	no	na	sad	failed
This world is cruel. People often like to comment something about your physical appearances when they know absolutely nothing about you for whatever reason. Including children. I had a similar experience when I was volunteering at a tutoring school for students ages five to probably 12. I had lots of acne and I was deep down so insecure about myself and hated everything about me. I remembered a kid asking “why do you have so much acne on your face?”with a big smirk and that type of voice hard to describe. And they followed up with other questions related which were all very painful to my sensitive insecure self. There was other volunteers and kids around and they all looked at me. I just froze and didn’t know what to say and started to red up. I don’t remembered how I got to move past that at the moment, but I just remembered this incident and the humiliation although the kid probably didn’t even mean anything. At the end of the day, they’re kids- you can’t expect them to have the same maturity as an adult, even though some adults are horrible too. Well that’s just my take and stop calling yourself ugly. You’re just making yourself feel worse and feeding into that idea. Instead, accept who you are for you are, and love yourself. Then these comments would not impact you at all or get you sad. It might frustrate you for a little bit but you know you are beautiful so it doesn’t matter whoever is saying all that bullshit.	moralmeemo	reply	na	na	na	0.017529714852571487	no	strong	no	na	sad	failed

This was my mentality my entire life until a few years ago and I turn 40 in October. I think 💭 these types of feelings can be hard to overcome, I got bullied a lot in school and never had a best friend or any friends for that matter. I also never payed attention in school and struggled a lot and dropped out of high school but I graduated a year or two later. I spent my life being under the influence because I had a pretty rough childhood and had to grow up way to fast. This mentality I had which was similar to yours didn’t stop until I realised I am my own worst enemy. once I stopped thinking about how I’m not worth anything and gave myself a chance that’s when it all changed for me. It took me 22-23 years to figure this out and honestly if I could talk to my 17 year old self I would say “hey, life’s gonna be hard but your self worth is worth fighting for!” I truly hope that you can be more kind to yourself and know that life is a pain in the ass for now but it will get better ❤️‍🩹 any only you have the power to make that change.

My whole life I’ve always done things solo. Especially video games but tonight nothing seems fun to me anymore. I got to talking with friends about relationships and how a lot of guys would like to date me but girls not so much. Now this wouldn’t be an issue if I was gay but because I’m not it does make a bit of an issue cause I’ve turned them down but I’ll still compliment them and other guys cause it’s just the kind thing to do but I just want someone to be able to love back. I want a girlfriend and to those of you who say “you just need to get out of your shell and ask a girl out” well there is one girl I liked but all she talks about is another coworker and every once in a while she’ll joke about something with me or someone else and to those of you who just say to wait, we’ll I have waited. I’ll be 21 in a little over a month and yeah I know I’m young and it’ll come to me eventually. Supposedly. I’ve got good things about me it’s just that I’m a gaming Redditor who works 40 hours a week 8 hours a day every week and plays dnd every Tuesday and Thursday. Sure I get out of the house but on the days that I don’t have anything planned I’m inside all day playing video games. Solo. But now I’m getting to the point where It’s just not fun for me anymore. Sure I could ask a friend to play with me but I’m an insomniac night owl who can’t sleep during the day so I’m the only one up this late at night and the games that I have no one else in my friend groups has them. The games that I play like Titanfall and Anthem and Dauntless are games that I play. Not anyone else in my friend group. So… like, I’m just at a loss for everything and I don’t know where to go from here because I was never taught anything about this. Never taught how to flirt, how to look better, how to do better, how to do this or that or anything relating to love because I’m a guy. My “dad” John thought that I would just know it from birth. Little did that fucking bitch know that that would be my downfall!!! So, I, just don’t know where to go from here.

Hell, January literally ended with me having 2 attempts at ending it all, and when I thought January was how bad things can get the rest of my year leading up to this day involved me getting deported, more attempts at offing myself, numerous job application rejections, and at least 15 upperclassmen girls hating me which brings about 300 of their friends in total hating me by association. 

I haven’t really fully processed the trauma 2023 has brought me and every now and then I pretend I’m alright and I try to repress the sadness as I go about my day just for it all to come back when I’m alone with no distractions. I don’t think I’m in a position to tell you how to conquer it because I haven’t myself but strength it numbers. We’re not the only 2 people having a bad year, and even with vastly different experiences we’re both 2 people who wake up everyday with a baggage to carry. 

I don’t know what to do with myself either, the sadness and trauma just doubles out of nowhere. I won’t promise you that it will get better or that the worst is over, but for now, let’s just try to get through it one day at a time alright? You and me both. Let’s do what we can to just survive the next day ahead of us. Sincerely from the bottom of my heart, I hope you find the peace of mind you need one day.

I was recently cut ties with this guy. We’ve been talking for 2 1/2 months now and I loved him very much. We never really “got” together but it was close enough to the point where it felt like we were. A little backstory. We met online but yes, we have seen how each other looks like. I really liked him, we called almost everyday and for hours too. We both liked video games so we played together sometimes. He would often stream me the games he’d play if I couldn’t play at the time. He did ask me if I wanted to be his girlfriend but I didn’t like the idea of online dating so I rejected him, he understood and we decided to just be friends. We continued to get along for another month until one night he decided to block me. I didn’t understand why. I tried to contact him, in the end he decided to come back. He told me when I flirted with him it felt like I was “playing” with him and I never meant what I said. (Of course I meant the things). I reassured him I mean all the nice things I say to him. I hoped this would’ve fixed some things. Later on a few days. He says he doesn’t wanna be friends anymore. I was broken, like after he comes back after blocking me he leaves again? I ask him if I did something wrong and why he was leaving. He just tells me he doesn’t wanna be friends with me anymore and blocks me on every platform we have contact on. He knows I’m sensitive and tells me not to break myself over him. That night I cried. A LOT. He meant a lot to me, he made me so happy and I loved him. He also told me he never meant it when he said he “loves me”. This broke me even more. I’m now sitting here thinking about if everything’s my fault and if it’s the way I acted or the things I said.

It’s not your fault. It’s the difference between the male and female brain. This guy seems like he wanted to be as happy as he possibly could be as soon as possible. To be stimulated. That’s why guys are always after sex. Not saying he was after that. But it wasn’t enough for him to just be your friend. When he blocked you the first time, he thought when he came back, you’d be scared of him leaving again and change your mine, so he would be satisfied. When he left the second time, he was either hurt that he didn’t mean enough to you for you to change your mind, or he really didn’t love you, or both. For some reason, some of us that are obsessed with real, true love, want it to be like the movies, and want to be the end all be all for the other person. Like nothing compared to us. Selfish, yes, but innocent. Not malicious. Some just use others.	MasterpieceMaster956	reply	na	na	na	0.9987867474555969	weak	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.
"Many people here said to Get a Hobby, trust me im trying to find one.

I posted here for a while. Whats my Biggest Problem? 

I try to meditate, work, exercise, study, learn a language, listen to music, watch a show, or listen to podcast everyday

im still missing that ""Fun"" thing. i know that isn't porn or sexting. im finding it hard to find out what i want, is it friends? no, GF? no.. i think my thoughts have made me believe that ""Friends or GF or porn"" would be the solution to my Problems but i know they aren't. 

I only know i know that i want to be better. Learning about Critical thinking, Psychology, Space, Ancient Civilizations, Observational skills, Time Management, Conversations.. Many more. do i work on these one by one? Most of these are ""Mental work"" do these count as goals? 

Always basing my self worth on how others react. i think i was afraid of opening my messages because i messaged so many girls i was afraid of ""Being Ignored, or one line replies"" i think i was afraid because then i would base my self worth/personality on those replies. 

but i opened the replies anyways. i dont know what to base my self worth on. 

but recently im not overly mad at my self for any tiny mistake, i talk less but not mute. im trying to find the balance between Passive aggressive.

"Just because half the time I don't really think about it much but the other half of the time I would say it still causes quite a lot of anxiety/difficult emotions. And if I see something on my phone or on social media which is related to something similar to what I did to myself(for example the other day I saw a post on Instagram about the same hospital I had to go to surgery for self harm when I was 12 and it was actually a photo of the hospitals eye department and idk why but for some reason I felt a bit weird/shaky seeing the post. If im being completely honest, Im still very much in a cycle of feeling like i keep deserving to hurt myself because of feeling like because I hurt the people who care about me when I hit my eye.

"Today I was almost sleeping on the couch and my mom walked past me. She started playing with my hair as it’s something she’s done ever since I was a kid. However my grandpa who came over for the week saw us. He is 92 y/o and has developed a bit of Alzheimer. He only remembers the important parts of his life. For a little bit of context, his parents both died when he was around six and he got placed in an orphanage. When he saw us, is only comment was: It seems nice, I never had that… This small comment made me sad and had me rethink how the love of a mother is something I take for granted even though some people never experienced it.

I honestly hate it. I can't. I don't want to be here anymore. I am always depressed and stressed. I can't seem to be happy for long. I don't have any one I can talk to about this. My depression is consuming me so much to where I might explode. I have good things that are happening in my life, its just that bad things out shine them.

"I've never had the opportunity to be in a relationship. I grew up moderately isolated and have only made a move on a girl once. Spoiler alert: that didn't work out. And the girls who have made moves on me never felt like they were at my tempo. Fast forward to a couple months ago and I met a very sweet girl at work. I work at a bank and she had lots of deposits that she had to make practically daily. Because of that, we got familiarized with each other very quickly. 

Even after the first week, I started to experience things I have never felt in my life. Like the mutual attraction to each other. I was saying dumb things, blushing, and ultimately looking stupid, but she was too. I morally could not ask her out at work in fears of making her work life harder, but she didn't have those same morals I guess. I went out to find a note on my car that helped us set up our first date. I wanted to lead to this part specifically because it will be the only moment of this relationship that I am proud of. Since we both like hiking and wanted to do so earlier in the morning, we got breakfast... AT AGE 24, I TOOK MY FIRST DATE TO CRACKER BARREL... and we enjoyed every bit of it. 

That being said, it was also the start of some unfortunate omens. She started telling me more about herself and the topic of mental health came into the subject. Although she is an incredibly strong women, she has lived a life of suffering that I would have never guessed. A lot of said suffering was committed by past exes. In the time I knew her, there really were some heart breaking stories. I have always found myself to be the person people ""trauma dumped"" on, but this was different, this came from a place of trust, and I was delighted that I earned that trust.  


It was almost comedic how many corny dates and moments we had in such a short amount of time, but they were firsts for me, and they were everything I ever imagined and more. Seeing her wear my hoodies, having my first kiss with someone I loved, her holding me while we watched the sunset, her laying on my chest while watching fireworks. That list goes on for a while, but not as long as I wanted.   


After one of our corny dates, I ended up meeting her friends later in the night. They were fine, a little corny, a little immature, but they made her happy and that's all I cared about. That being said, it wasn't a place for me. When I drove her home she asked if I wanted to drop her off or come inside. It was getting late, but I would have much rather spent quality time with her to end my night. Going even later into that night we started to put ourselves in more erotic positions  and she ended up having one of her PTSD flashbacks. These are very much caused by abusive exes and her rapists. Although it was the first time I've seen it, I remember what she told me to do when she entered that state. I went through that ritual and wasn't able to see her completely come out of that till 40 or so minutes. I was scared for her, and because of that, I put myself in positions that violated that trust she had in me. 

She told me she was fine to go to sleep by herself and I didn't listen. So, I stayed with her to spend the night and made the excuse that it was too late, so I might as well spend the night there. She was delighted, but my real intentions were just to make sure she was safe. On top of this, my mom was blowing up my phone because she was worried about me. So I told her the truth. I told my mom that I was there because she had a PTSD episode. She found out I texted her this, and because I ended up airing out her dirty laundry plus lied to her on my reasoning for staying, she started to end our relationship.   


The next day we discussed this further and her reasoning went just a bit beyond what happened last night. She mentioned her worries about my inexperience (ouch), my relationship with my mom (that actually is a real problem), and having a pattern of babying her. These are things that I would assume other couples could work out, but her past partners seem to have put her in a defensive position and I don't blame her for putting up those walls again.   


She was everything to me. I have never felt such joy just from waking up and having someone on my mind. I have never held someone and felt my sorrow vanish into thin air. I have never felt a connection that made me lose all track of time. I have also never felt this pain. This is the most excruciating pain I have felt in my life. I can barely eat anything, my days are filled with nonstop crying, and my nights are sleepless. There's a chance our fates may intertwine again, but I'm not insane enough to think that will actually happen. 

&#x200B;

If you read all of this for some reason, thank you. It's hard for me to rationalize how to move on, so using this post to word out some things was nice.   


TLDR; She was everything I ever wanted, and I lost her because I was an idiot and violated her trust. I am struggling to find a reason to go on. I did not know I could feel like that, but I am doubting I could get that feeling back again."

"I’m sorry, but I’m also glad for you that you were able to experience this connection even for a short while. I hope that both she and you grow from this experience and become the people you were meant to be all along.

I didn’t have anything I’d call an actual romantic relationship with anyone until I was 27 when I met and eventually fell in love with my now-ex. He was more experienced than I was, but it didn’t *really* matter. We both had our baggage, but I thought we could share it with each other. We spent over two and a half years in an exclusive relationship, and when he ended things, I was heartbroken and angry and sad. I wondered why I had wasted my time trying to build something with someone who didn’t want to be with me. It absolutely *sucked*. It’s been three years since that happened, and while I’ll always carry an affection for him and mourn the relationship’s end, I don’t regret it. Being with him was good when it was good, and it was bad when it was bad. It hurt, but it also brought me joy. Overall, it was part of life. And I’ve moved on since. I’d like to say I’ve found new love and a great new partner, but I’m still figuring a lot of shit out. I am in a relatively new relationship, but there’s a *lot* that I’m unsure about, and I’m terrified of getting my heart broken again. But I do want to be vulnerable, and I’m willing to try again.

"I lost my cat 4 months ago. It’s starting to hurt again.. but sometimes I cry without feeling anything. Just looking at pictures gives me the urge to cry. Or the pictures will make me sad but I don’t miss her. I don’t understand. 

I also don’t understand why it’s hard to imagine she existed. It’s like she didn’t. I have pictures but it’s hard to recall those real moments.. it’s like she never existed. It feels like I’ve moved on. I dislike moving on without her. I want to be sad. It feels like that’s the only way to honor her. But then I don’t want to be sad. These mixed feelings or the lack of feelings really confuse me. Or sometimes theres just an intense sadness..where I can cry for a bit over an hour straight. 

I’m not sure what I need. I just needed to vent a bit so I could stop crying. But then it feels like I’m pushing my feelings away. I don’t want to hurt. I don’t want to feel numb. But then I do. Constantly having mixed feelings is tiring. I feel bad for my therapist lol. Lots of back and forth."

This is a real person btw: If you add a little bit of activity each day, dont go too fast, you will feel better, l like too run. Be proud of what u accomplish not mad at what u didn't. Life is too short for depression or anything else to consume ur life, u might be viewing life in a negative way, u wont fond happiness by doing that. Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, dont listen to a doctors diagnose unless its proving to assist you, u can still talk to a therapist tho.  I  Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible. Look up Bobby price guy health. U can’t end ur only life which is all u know by ending ur life. Don’t think mood swings last forever. Look for the smaller thrills and the bigger ones will come. If feeling hopeless u need to add more to ur life.

he was my first love, and it's been more time for us apart then together,  but I miss him every day. every place I go to I think about being there with him. I truly miss him, but he's got a new girlfriend  now. I've tried to move on. I've been going on countless dates with  guys I didn't even  liked that much, but I still gave them a chance so I could maybe forget about him. but I couldn't. and I still can't. and those other guys just made me realize how much I still love him. what should I do? hiw do I let go of my first love?

It's time to invest time into you. Read books, find hobbies you'd like to do, speak with someone if you need to. Invest in yourself and know that the rewards for this will be greater on the other side. I'm in the same place as you and I'll be praying for both of us. If you need anything, I'll be here.

Alot of alone time and sorry for the language a lot of masterbation. Like hate masterbation. And after that think of the things that made you stop loving yourself and putting yourself first. Once you really start really focusing on yourself you will slowly start letting him go and you will meet someone who will love you as much as you love yourself. I know it to be true because that's how I got over my first love. I had to drown in my advice for a few months but when I came out I didn't think about her anymore and the same will happen to you too.

You can be married to a new man have kids but still have that love for him and you know what? That’s okay and cherish that energy that you feel because there’s nothing in the world like it. 

Things will get better. When me and my first love broke up, my heart was shattered and I was completely and utterly devastated. I was so heartbroken that daily tasks became an issue for me and I couldn’t stop thinking of her. Every second of the day she was on my mind but…things got better. They never fully healed I still have my scars but me and her are close friends now and we still have feelings for one another.

I’m in the same boat as you. Everything, every place, is a constant reminder. And the universe also threw his best friends wife at me the other day, that really brought the tears. It’s been about half a year now and although the tears are mostly gone, the emptiness and the pain is still there. My advice is to just seek support in your friends and find a hobby. I was most hurt when I wasn’t allowing myself to enjoy anything. Once I got past that things got better. I don’t know if I’ll ever truly get over him but im at a point where I can go out with another man and genuinely have interest and attraction. It takes time, but you’ll be ok, you’ll be able to start moving on soon.	SliceOfCheesey	reply	na	na	na	0.07363294810056686	weak	strong	no	na	sad	failed

"OP - I feel your pain. Similar to you, I kind of wear my heart on my sleeve, but have only gotten a lot of betrayal and hurt for almost 30 years. I too, don't understand why people take advantage of, or at least, take for granted, pure, genuine care, love and trust. 

I wish I have an answer for you and for myself. But I just wanted to comment that you are not alone in this. 

Some people are too gentle for this world. And I guess, you either find other people like that (which there are), or you just have to learn to accept constant, little heartbreaks. 

I sometimes try to find solace in making myself believe that hurt is because I am paying a debt (I don't have to know it arose); anything I do for good that goes ""wasted/exploited"", I am depositing goodness for my future/next life.

I can’t take this pain anymore, I’ve been called ugly a few times in my life and it effects me greatly. Recently, I gained face fat, and my face broke out from stress. People noticed this change and started making fun of me. Sometimes, on walks I also get weird intrusive thoughts yk like “what if people think I’m attracted to them yk” they’re so bad, and now people yell out “I love you” to feed my delusiona.

This is a real person btw: If you add a little bit of activity each day, dont go too fast, you will feel better, l like too run. Be proud of what u accomplish not mad at what u didn't. Life is too short for depression or anything else to consume ur life, u might be viewing life in a negative way, u wont fond happiness by doing that. Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, u can still talk to a therapist tho. Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible. Look up Bobby price guy health. U can’t end ur only life which is all u know by ending ur life. Don’t think mood swings last forever. Look for the smaller thrills and the bigger ones will come. If feeling hopeless u need to add more to ur life. Look up dry creek ranger school how to deal with Loneliness.	Dependent-Run-999	reply	na	na	na	0.9967705011367798	weak	no	no	na	sad	failed

"I hope this goes here

I recently lost an important person in my life because I am selfish and unable to understand how others feel.

I have been single for a few years now and honestly I don't even try anymore. After the last time I know there is no one for me and that's ok, if I'm not meant to be with anyone, I'll just be alone. I have good friends

Obviously I can't deny that I didn't want it to end. I was able to see a future with that person, I know it won't come.

It may seem that I am sad because it is recent and it is partly true but after these years and thinking about it a lot, no matter what I do or how I behave it is never enough, maybe I am not attractive enough, muscular or tall, maybe I am not interesting enough, smart or funny, there is always an excuse.

Being the protagonist of my life just causes me problems, too many expectations, responsibilities... I'm so tired already.

How can I stop thinking about myself and give myself to others? If I take myself out of the equation I know that everything will be easier.

If I can't improve my life or be happy, at least I want to be able to help improve the lives of others."	Zitacool	post	25.95579019377233	male	White	0.9865218997001648	na	na	na	9	sad	failed

"it’s been like a year already since we broke up and i’m the one who ended the relationship . i feel like he became so comfortable to the point that he doesn’t care anymore. he’s from pampanga and im living at bulacan. and i broke up with him because i’ve realized all the mistreatment that he’s been doing to me. 

back to the topic…

i really love his mom and im really happy that i was able to make his grandmother love me. i was able to turn her into a very sweet and caring grandmother knowing that she’s very mean or snobby. they both accepted me for who i am especially because i have a sickness that can’t be cured. i love his mom because  she treats me as her daughter since her children are all boys. since she’s a single mom, she’s exposed into dating. she used to call me out of nowhere just to open up and cry on me. she’ll randomly message me and say that she misses me and asks me when will i go back to their house. also, we used to date together without my ex and her current bf. there are also times that my ex’s mom will rant or tell a story and requests that i shouldn’t tell this to my ex. actually, she even mixed my name with my ex for a business certificate (??) or something but its not a brand name. and worst, it can’t be change for 5 years. so i hope his girlfriend won’t overthink or be annoyed because of that. we also go out with her friends together with my ex. we actually had a beach outing. i even met their fam like friends of her grandmother, friends of his mom, his cousins, his dad’s new fam, his uncles and aunts, and many more. but of course, i do things in return. tbh, i just sneak out to my parents hehe but we’re legal it’s just that there are times i need to sneak out like overnights since they’re strict. i bake for them and etc. 

but worst of all, after we broke up. his mother never talked to me. actually, his mother’s friend showed more affection and made me feel that our connection during my rs with mu ex is sincere. i felt sad because she didn’t even greet me on my birthday. one time, she reacted heart in my facebook story but i gusss she just accidentally clicked it since it never happened again.

ugh i just really miss her :< it’s my first time to experience this kind of treatment. i really treasure and love his mom but ofc i won’t go back with my ex just because i love her mom and he already have a new gf and im happy for him. and prolly, his mom acts like that because his son’s new gf is a daughter of one of her friends. prolly, she just loves her more that why she don’t want to talk to me like ofc maybe she don’t want the girl to overthink because we still have connections. i understand that but all in all, i just miss her and not his son."	seeyou_nextlife	post	24.534081268117937	male	White	0.9917491674423218	na	na	na	1	sad	failed

I think a lot of people are gonna say you’re being used, and I won’t verifiably say one or the other as I don’t know the guy, but I urge you to listen to me. There’s a lot of struggle with men to feel vulnerable and safe with others (generally) as a result of societal conditioning. Him being hurt in the past probably only exacerbates these issues. Of course, he could just be playing you, but I urge you to look for any behaviour that would indicate that it comes from an internal struggle, and not a want to manipulate. Keep an eye out for both possibilities though.	ashtonraine	reply	na	na	na	0.0012372531928122044	weak	no	no	na	sad	failed
If he's genuine, being public wouldn't be a problem. Think about it, what he's risking isn't being hurt by what others say, it's being hurt by the relationship itself. If he wants to keep you a secret, then you shouldn't let him lead you on.. you deserve to be someone's. Being hurt is not excuse, it sounds like he's hurting you already, if you're posting here on /sad. He's not deep or complex for wanting to not be a couple. He wants something from you, be it sex, company or something else without having to commit to you. Be careful.	ashtonraine	reply	na	na	na	0.0012372531928122044	weak	no	no	na	sad	failed

"This time last year I was in a loving relationship with a wonderful relationship with an amazing girl. 

Then I went to work abroad for a year.

Now I am in love with this country and cannot bare to face a bleak future in my home country.

This has meant that I have had to end my relationship as there is no way she will be able to make it over here.

Now I have to go back to my home country, and I will have to fight tooth and nail to get back here.

Only this time, its without her to inspire and comfort me.

There is a part of me that wants to stay with her, at least whilst i try to get back there.... but that is cruel, selfish and unfair.

It is so painful to see her go... but its for the best.

Now I face at least 3 years of misery as I try to secure a job in my dream country, and build a life out their.

I know this is the time to do it as i am 24, but damn, do i feel hollow.

I am not looking for sympathy or any tender hearts, this is all me, all my doing, I just needed to let this out. And I have no one to let it out to.

"I'm just venting here, I need to say what Im feeling because it's consuming me. 
First off it's been like a week I have been feeling dread and a bad feeling but didn't know why. 
Werid and I thought I was going crazy to worry without a valid reason at the time. 
Then I had plumbing issues and needed an expensive fix. It was horrible I couldn't use my bathroom until the plumber came. Now everything except the tub (parcial clog, drain slowly) is fixed thank GOD! 
Then I am on my way to the Dr to get my medicine when my car wont start. A neighbor tried jumping it and it still wouldn't start. 
She was kind  to help me to drive me to my appointment. I was very thankful then the plumber came back and tried the bathroom tub drain. Only to find out it's s bigger job for that and I have to wait.  Before he left he tried jumping my car and no go Esther. He even tried with a portable charger and his truck but nope. So I don't know what's wrong with my car. I don't have money to fix it and I get money for my rent and bills thur working with my car with Doordash. I can't make money to fix my car.

It's a vicious circle. I need my car to make the money to fix my car. If I don't fix it I can't make my rent money. Im in a bad situation.  I don't have any family around me to help and the further ones probably won't help me because everyone has their own issues, understandably.  
 I always treat homeless people with respect because I know something simple like this can lead a person in a different direction in life.  If I don't have enough money to fix my car I won't be able to pay my own rent and just like that I lose my home.  I can be like them  in a snap of a finger so it's important to treat everyone with the respect they treat you with.  

I feel soo very sad and I need help that no one can give. I don't even know how to ask for help. I keep trying to get any job asap to get $to keep paying my bills/rent/food.  I'm rationing incase I don't get anything kind of income. 
Thank you if anyone read all this.  I would appreciate prayers for help my way and so I can stop feeling desper and desperation. Sometimes even like being dead is better. I feel so guilty thinking this."	Moonpalico	post	30.421858125176858	female	White	0.9905529022216797	na	na	na	3	sad	failed

Sometimes you can be better off without family. I cut mine off after many years of trouble my parents and my brother caused.

"Yeah, it can be really hard. I stopped talking to my father about 15 years ago. He was always lying, manipulating, and stealing money from me (going so far as to take loans on my name, me a recent graduate at the time, just starting life, never had a penny to my name and was raised by my single mother, my father being mostly absent).

I gave him another chance 10 years ago, inviting him to a restaurant to talk. Within 20 minutes he was involving me in schemes saying how I had to do this, and had to call this person, and ""you must, you have to"", barking me orders. I walked out and left.

My brother never had a problem with him, or me with my brother, but it drove a wedge. I still kept contact with my brother, trying to see him at least once a year. Over 3 years ago, we made plans that he would honor a certain request to inform me before a certain thing happened. He didn't, and informed me after the fact (I'm getting vague and maybe it's not understandable, but it's personal. Anyway, he lied and pretended it was nothing).

I hadn't contacted him since, he texted me a couple of months after that on my birthday in 2020 but I never replied. He never contacted me again, or even asked ""hey, is there anything wrong"", and I had never ignored him before. I had always replied to anything he said with at least ""thank you"", so he should have guessed there was something wrong.

A few days ago I texted him to say I was burning the bridge and he was out of my life forever. He immediately texted back that he hadn't contacted me since 2020 and that I was a fat loser.

It's bitter sweet, and makes me really sad, but it's the last tether and I cut it free. I have no strings anymore."	Ilikeanimaldog	reply	na	na	na	0.9990363121032715	weak	strong	no	na	sad	failed
Yeah it sounds like you lr family sucks just like mine does tbh. I would list what they did but I'd be here a very long time if I listed everything they did over the years to me and even my partner. I also tried to mend things too but I soon realised they were only trying to improve on themselves in a selfish way, but we're the same people underneath, nothing had changed really. I get fleeting thoughts about it sometimes and the odd nightmare, but overall I've been much better for cutting them all out and I've actually finally had the head space to do some counselling and take care of me for once. I guess what I'm saying is, things will only get better :)	Ilikeanimaldog	reply	na	na	na	0.9990363121032715	weak	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.
"> long time if I listed everything they did over the years to me and even my partner. 

You made me remember the time my father hit on my girlfriend in front of me. In public at a family gathering.

In my head, growing up, I thought ""Family means we are honest with each other, even when honesty hurts, because we are on the same team. And we'll help each other if we can"". Turned out to be manipulation and always trying to get some money or advantage or even just selfish attention, which I wouldn't mind, if it was at least reciprocated.

I don't know if it gets better. I've never cheated on anyone, or been dishonest, but I've been cheated on and lied to so often. In any case, it gets better in general. I mean financially and concretely my life is better in every facet. But right now it I feel pretty alone. A lot of it is my fault, I've been very distant to many people around me who are very nice, honest and friendly. But for family to betray you, lie to your face, try to pull on strings, really it hurts. I do cry about it."	Ilikeanimaldog	reply	na	na	na	0.9990363121032715	no	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.
"Ah yeah my dad used to do shit like that too. Totally get you on that front.

Yeah I used to think basically the same thing. Always thought blood was everything. Was always taught that. Turned out that was just so I was easier to control and manipulate, and so I wouldn't speak out or even recognise abuse.

It definitely will get better. I get lonely sometimes too, as I'm also great at shitting people out and don't exactly have a great deal many friends, but it has gradually got better, especially with counselling, that's really helped me look at things and other people from a different perspective. The past does hurt and I really feel that sometimes too, but I've noticed I'm looking back less and less as time goes on"	Ilikeanimaldog	reply	na	na	na	0.9990363121032715	no	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.
">Always thought blood was everything. Was always taught that. 

Same. Also repeated over and over ""blood is thicker than water"". So one time my father stole something from me, then told me that, and I replied ""well if it's thicker it should stick together"", and he said ""exactly"", and I asked how this justified him stealing from me. And he just pretended it never happened and just smiled ""I'll make it up to you, don't worry"".

Hey, you know what? You've been better to me than 1000 therapists. I've had to get this out my chest, and just talking with a stranger. I think we shared a reality unspoken, for many.

"TLDR
this feeling in my stomach is getting worse and worse. i can’t get over her. she did me wrong and i did her wrong. we both hurt each other but i wanted to just push through. why couldn’t she want it as bad as i did. i blocked her after telling her off because i was so upset. and i unblocked her because i missed her so much it hurt and she called me weird for unblocking her and she blocked me on everything and out of spite i texted her on tik tok saying “fuck u” i love her so much and i’m in so much pain. i don’t want to feel like this anymore. i’ve never met anyone like her. she can fuck with my mind over and over and i’ll still be in love with her. she fucked with my head so many times. i could get with any random girl but it’s her that i want. i miss her so much and i don’t get how you can abandon someone you love. she’s 19 i’m 20 and you can say “you’re so young” why would anyone want to find love when their older ? i wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. she did so much shady shit and i’m no angel. i fucked up a lot as well and i always took accountability and i changed. she refused to see it and i just wanted her to love me back and give me reassurance and she never did. guys will tell me “she’s the woman she shouldn’t have to give you reassurance” but i’ve been so alone for so long that even the littlest shift in behavior makes me feel like they’re bored of me and will move on. i’m pretty sure she’s moved on and it hurts and i am happy that she’s able to move on and be happy but i really wanted it to be with me."

"I'm a teacher and have been teaching for 3 years going on my 4th year. I had passed all of my certification except for one. I had taken it twice before last school year ended, but failed both times. I studied really hard and felt confident this 3rd time around. I've always been a bad test taker, so taking it for the 3rd time has boost my anxiety. 

After the test, I felt okay. A lot of the materials I studied for wasn't really on the test, which felt so off. But I was hopeful. I just got my result back an hour ago and I didn't pass. I feel very dumb. Now I have to wait another 45 days until I can take it again. But this time it'll be my last try...

I don't know how my career will be since the content I teach requires for me to pass that one certification exam.

This is a real person btw: If you add a little bit of activity each day, dont go too fast, you will feel better, l like too run. Be proud of what u accomplish not mad at what u didn't. Life is too short for depression or anything else to consume ur life, u might be viewing life in a negative way, u wont fond happiness by doing that. Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, u can still talk to a therapist tho. Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible. Look up Bobby price guy health. U can’t end ur only life which is all u know by ending ur life. Don’t think mood swings last forever. Look for the smaller thrills and the bigger ones will come.

What is the point in life? If every human was to disappear it would help the planet so why don’t we? If I was to disappear not many people would care and not many people would be affected some would even be happy so why don’t I? Life is pointless. One day earth and everything on it could be gone and it wouldn’t matter. We are so insignificant. We are all gonna die anyways there is no point. So many people make you feel so awful and bad which if you didn’t exist wouldn’t happen so what is the point? You do so much just to be treated badly by other people and just eventually die and have all that work be pointless. What is the point on trying to find someone that likes me of no one will. There is someone you like or love that won’t feel the same and will just make you sad so just avoid people, avoid them. Life is terrible a lot of the time so what is the point in trying in life if it’s going to be miserable, is it to be sad?
All the pain and struggle amounts to nothing in the end there is no point. Almost no one likes me and life is pointless. I feel like I’m not even good enough for anyone else. I feel useless compared to everyone else. I am slowly becoming sadder and sadder as I get older and worse and worse of a person. I am less kind then when I was younger, less honest, less hardworking, less like able, a worse person. I just want to quit and give up. No one would understand if I talked about this stuff or showed them this so you hide your feelings to make it seem like you’re okay. I feel worthless and know I am because I am not a kind enough, hardworking enough, caring enough, smart enough, dedicated enough, funny enough, perfect enough human for everyone else so no one likes me so why don’t I just give up? I think that will be my solution. If I give up then it won’t matter that I’m not good enough, that I’m not kind enough, that I’m not perfect enough. Nothing will matter. I’m sick of crying. Tired of trying. Yeah I’m smiling but inside I’m dying. The only flowers I’m receiving is at my funeral. I feel worthless. If my own dad doesn’t feel the need to text me and talk to me and love me then why should I love myself? I have stopped caring because I am just going to end it all soon. Why try to get close with school friends and make them not hate me if not a single one of them cares about me. I will get their stuff if they leave it behind, give them my food, instead of doing my work I’ll help others during ASC, I do everything I can do make life just that little bit nicer for them but when do they return the favor? Never. Because no one likes me so I’ve stopped liking myself.
I feel like I am just a waste of everything. A waste of water, air, food, money time, attention. Everything. I am a bad person, I am stupid, lazy, fat, slow, ugly, short, annoying, obnoxious, mean, addicted to my phone, unlike able, can’t listen, can’t take a hint, terrible, wont shut up Oliver. That’s who I am. I am a pest to the world. some people want me to be gone so wish is granted, I will kill myself. Your welcome. I hate myself. Everyone has convinced me I’m a terrible person so I wish I could just press a button and be gone but that’s not a thing so I will do the second best option. I will kill myself.

I'm sorry to say this but you are 13!  This is a mood swing. You are becoming more hormonal and it's hitting you hard. You say your tired of working hard??  At chores? Homework?  When you get older you will rethink and say wth?  I use to be like this and now I'm freaking old and wish I was younger. My main problem is having money for bills. I'm so tired of maybe I'll make my rent or not. Maybe I'll eat today or not. Life is hard. If you have parents and a home try to talk to them to tell them how you feel. Honestly. Maybe talking to them will help. Or u can talk here to us and we can try to support you emotionally but trust me life gets so much harder. Try to put urself in an adults shoes, the weight of the responsibilities. It's hard. I hope you feel better.  Reach out to anyone to help you sort out your feelings.

So recently I had a one night stand with this European guy really sweet guy I may say. He cuddled me and we interlocked fingers while talking about really intimate things. Everything seemed so perfect and sweet before I had to check out of my hotel I let him know. He simply grabbed his things and said I had been a good host and then said see you later. Mind you we were both vacationing so the chances of ever coming across each other are very slim. I felt really sad afterwards because I never got his socials or anything. I guess I’m not used to such tender guys in one night stands. What do you guys think.	Nearby-Commercial-72	post	1.3620079576720343	female	White	0.005988856311887503	na	na	na	2	sad	failed

This is a real person btw: If you add a little bit of activity each day, dont go too fast, you will feel better, l like too run. Be proud of what u accomplish not mad at what u didn't. Life is too short for depression or anything else to consume ur life, u might be viewing life in a negative way, u wont fond happiness by doing that. Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, u can still talk to a therapist tho. Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible. Look up Bobby price guy health. U can’t end ur only life which is all u know by ending ur life. Don’t think mood swings last forever. Look for the smaller thrills and the bigger ones will come. If feeling hopeless u need to add more to ur life.	Hanauwuu	reply	na	na	na	0.0014134824741631746	weak	no	no	na	sad	failed

"This honestly probably belongs in r/sadcringe but whatever. I mean maybe not. I'm not really desperate to date anyone and sometimes I'm fine with the fact that he's not real, but sometimes I'm not...

I created this character almost six years ago (August 4, 2017!!) that I draw a lot, write about, and think a lot about. For the longest time I was okay with him not being real TBH (though I always thought how could would it be to meet him, or any character I created for that matter). But, recently, I've been a bit sad that he's not real. I've had feelings for him for nearly six years now and it's only gotten stronger as time has gone on.

There's a few things I want to note, and I'm going to list them. They're just going to be a bunch of random thoughts and me venting basically lol:

\-I am diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses including GAD, MDD, OCD, and so on. Typically people who deal with what I'm dealing with also face mental illness like this. And, honestly, the way my mind is, it makes so much sense I'd be so attracted to a fictional character/not really be interested in dating real people.

\-I have had feelings for real-life people, too. Like, *intense* crushes. but usually they're older guys. My character is also older than I am.

\-I did actually date someone about a year ago for the first time, but it was a disastrous experience. He was a trainwreck of a person to put it simply. AKA he did not have his shit together at all. Addicted to so many drugs, out of money constantly, etc. throughout the relationship I would wish to myself that he would be this fictional character instead of who he actually was (although tbf he was a pretty crappy person lol).

\-Recently I've been thinking, what if I lucid dream so I could talk to him? Though that does sound a little crazy -- or extra crazy, as if any of this doesn't sound crazy already. But whatever, this is a legit issue I'm facing, no matter how crazy or cringey it may seem.

\-I'm in my early 20's. I'm no longer just a young teenager going through a phase, I don't think. I think this may be a real issue, especially because now I'm just sad about this situation sometimes.

\-A little TMI, but whatever. I do have sexual fantasies with this character pretty much everyday but, tbh, there's so much more I'd want to do with this character. Go have coffee at a coffee shop (I'm a ""coffee addict"" and he would be one too if he were real lol), take a walk through the park, etc. Sometimes I even imagine us doing more mundane stuff like going grocery shopping (altho in my opinion I think grocery shopping is actually pretty fun lol it ain't that mundane)

\-He has a favorite band. I wish we could go to a concert of theirs together

\-I don't really find myself being attracted to anyone else anymore. I used to have multiple crushes at once but it's just reduced to him. I feel a sense of ""loyalty"" to him, even though he isn't real. But I almost like to treat him like he's real and respect him in that way

\-Following the previous point, even recently here on Reddit someone DM'd me asking if I wanted to chat. He sent a picture of ""himself"" (it was a picture he stole from the Internet of a male model, I found out soon after). But, at first, I thought that's what he actually looked like. Even though I recognized him as handsome I thought in no way -- even though he was a male model and very handsome -- he could compare to my character. I literally see my character as the most attractive ""person"" I've ever seen

\-Usually people who are like me struggle socially. I used to very much but not anymore for the most part actually. I'm able to fit in socially and get along with a lot of people. I even get hit on by guys a lot but none of them stick out to me. And, even if they do, I am very afraid to approach them in a romantic way for a variety of reasons. All the stigma surrounding sex and dating from when I was growing up has made me terrified of dating to the point where I'm not sure if I can do it again. I constantly felt guilty when I got romantic with the first boyfriend I had. I feel much safer imagining myself getting romantic with this fictional character (but even then I feel guilty about that, I'm fearful that I'm sinning against God by doing this).

\-I do figure one day I'll find somebody, and he won't be exactly like this character. Which is fine. But I do think he will be somewhat like him at least. Though, if I could be with my character, I 100% would choose to do this. If he wanted to marry me I would absolutely say yes.

Sorry for the long post lol, I just needed to rant about this. I really think I need to see a therapist again :/"	DryCoast	post	25.097495832955193	female	White	0.0036572355311363935	na	na	na	3	sad	failed

I'm sorry you're dealing with this. I hope things get better for you. I'll tell you one of the saddest things I saw working fast food. I worked at a kfc, there was a homeless shelter just down the road. You could literally see it from the window. When I saw how much food got thrown away at night I was pretty upset and asked the manager why don't we give it to the homeless shelter instead of putting it in the dumpster? They said corporate wouldn't allow it because they could get sued if anyone got sick. I said really? How hard is it to just have them sign a waiver saying the can't sue? It's not like it was good from days ago, it was what was left at the end of the day, some of it had just been made an hr or less before closing. It was truly sad.

It's not socially acceptable but... If you go to a local fast food joint, find an outside trash can, find a receipt, take it inside and say you came thru a bit ago an they missed (something on the receipt) from your order.

Very few do. The little ceasers here doesn't throw out the leftovers even tho they're supposed to. We sont have a homeless shelter here, but somehow word got around that if you're homeless, or even if you have a home but can't afford food, if you go out behind it at closing time they hand the leftover stuff out to people back there waiting. The kfc wouldn't even let us like, box it up and put it in clean bags and set it BESIDE the dumpsters, they made sure the food and trash all went in the same bag and if you didn't put it IN the dumpster (that had old oil, grease, maggots and roaches in it) then you'd get fired.

Firstly what does your diet consist of? Are you aware of what is healthy and not?

What medication is this- perhaps it is stopping you from losing weight? 

Are there any gyms or parks in your area? Small baby steps like 15 minute walks after lunch can progress into proper runs. Just stay consistent and comfortable, as your stamina builds you will be able to do more.

"Hey man, I’m glad you are here. It’s a very endearing request to hear nice stories, very sweet and lovely. 

Apologies, i am not interesting but here is a recent occurrence.

 My pup has been ferociously licking his paws until they were inflamed and red ever since he was little. Tried cutting out chicken/beef/meat and all sorts of things.

Can you guess the little idiot is allergic to? 
Turns out >!its grass of all things!< 

I just found it so silly, here we are worrying about his diet and doing what’s best for him but it’s no use. It’s nothing we can control. 

Grass is everywhere and he loves grass, there is only maintaining and cleaning him when the grass gets too much. 

I suppose im a sappy bastard but I thought it was a nice little thought, sometimes we are dealt with a shitty hand. It’s so unfair for us to make the best of that instead of getting something spoonfed to us like others.

But this is our life and even if it’s painful or bitter or boring this is it. There will be small beauty that deserves to be appreciated and there will be things that make you happy. Maybe it’s for a little while but still it’s enough to remind us that we still live.

Again I don't wanna think that my weight and appearance is the problem for it....I just want to have this that's so normal for others to find and have...can't stop thinking about it at this point , many times crying myself to sleep
What should I do? Is there any other way to find someone?"	InternationalLocal30	post	32.49089711612532	female	White	0.9967098236083984	na	na	na	6	sad	failed

made a poem about how emotional things are hope you like it.

Angels haunt me.. as i scream,

Demons taunt me & my dreams

This Human grain Sown in pain Faith drips in red on the sword of my heart Still we share Wasted prayers Piety bears no reward...;=; thrown day by day it's cold, and dark, and dreary wasted eerie & teary.

so depressed while i gaze.....at the maze, all i think about is time, yet i climb, When i cry in turmoil we will understand the breaking of the soul And the blinding light shall fade Our eyes will endure the pain, as i fall in my abyss... it shall swallow me whole, Forever torn to be alone... to be thrown under on my own, ;=; ;-; ;-; ;-; ;-; ;-; ;-; ;-; ;-; ;-; ;-; yet none of my life has happiness, endless suffering endures... am i impure, Nobody knows it’s empty, The smile that I wear. The real one is left behind it's in the cracks in the past Because I left you there…

Nobody knows I am crying. They won’t even see my tears. When they think I am laughing but i'm on the edge, I wish you were here. We are beautiful, we are vile Multifarious, blood and bile in our style. A strength for the deserted in reconcile."	legionPEWDSLWAIY123	post	18.567224474587217	female	White	0.0036212399136275053	na	na	na	5	sad	failed

"Note: Looking back and proof reading this, I am so sorry for all the girl in red references, I swear it was accidental.

I've tried my hardest to get passed whatever this summer depression is, but it's just gotten worse.

This happens every year, and I'm sick of it. I just feel like shit every single summer and it sucks. This time, though, has been a lot worse on me. This time, all that's going through my head is my ex SAing me, my old friends stabbing me in the back, stress from not being good enough for my mother's love, and more. 

Though, this time, I have my boyfriend here to support me through this, so it helps a bit, but not much. I had a therapist last summer, but not this one.

I don't think I exactly want to die, but I'm not too fond of the idea of living. I just want to dissappear. Like I'm not gonna go do anything or attempt anything, but I'm not exactly gonna be mad if it does happen. Partially because I'll be dead, so it won't matter. 

Anyways, thanks for listening."	luffixs_	post	22.136858922139822	female	White	0.998036801815033	na	na	na	5	sad	failed

Yea you’re an idiot. Why in the hell would you propose to someone else when you’re in a relationship😂😂 you’re only sad because your hopes with this new girl are over so you have to stay with the original one. It probably also sucks that you have to stay with her for an uncertain amount of time now too. Honestly you should tell her, you’re a selfish spineless weasel who would’ve had no problem leaving her if the new girl accepted your proposal.

"For the past four years, my life has been a rollercoaster of emotions, navigating an on-off relationship with someone I deeply loved. Our journey began with promising love and passion, but after a few months, she dropped a bombshell—she needed a break to figure herself out. Confused and heartbroken, I desperately fought for us, hoping to salvage our connection. Miraculously, we found our way back to each other, and for a while, things seemed better.

Yet, this pattern kept repeating itself—she would pull away, feeling suffocated by the commitment, and I would scramble to reason with her, hoping to keep our love alive. It became a never-ending cycle of love, pain, and uncertainty. Despite my unwavering dedication, love, and respect for her, she'd eventually decide to end things, leaving me shattered and questioning my worth.

She'd reach out again, seemingly checking up on me or attempting to rekindle our connection, and I'd respond with cautious and guarded replies. However, these conversations often spiraled into arguments, with both of us expressing our hurt and frustration. Whenever she brought up her struggles with commitment, I couldn't help but feel immense sadness and anger, triggered by the pain of our unresolved issues.

Amidst this emotional turmoil, I continued to hold onto the hope that we could find a way to be together, despite acknowledging my own shortcomings in the relationship. I expressed my love and adoration for her, treated her with respect, and made my feelings abundantly clear. However, the lingering pain of her indecision made it challenging to stay composed when discussing our relationship's future.

Recently, she revealed once again that she couldn't see a relationship or future for us, but wanted to keep in touch since I am so important to her. The weight of this familiar scenario was unbearable, and I reached a breaking point. Fearing that staying in touch would only prolong my pain, I made the difficult decision to block her, hoping that distance would help me heal. I even told her that It was her decision over and over to give up on us and now I will have to cut all contact because its killing me. She told me I am hurting her too by cutting contact and making her a stranger. I couldn't see the point in that and I said its all her fault. It was almost like me putting all the blame on her for quitting on us again and again. I even said that we fight and stay for the people we love, we don't leave. I said all this because I was in so much pain.

Now, I'm grappling with guilt and self-doubt. Did I make the right decision by blocking her? Did I do enough to fight for our love? Does her desire to stay friends hold any significance, or is it just prolonging the inevitable heartache? Was I wrong in cutting her off ? Would she be thinking I’m the bad person for cutting her off ? I also miss her so much and I cant thinking about all this all the time. Its like my head is working overtime, I feel so burnt out. I cant seem to be happy.

I find myself devastated and in dire need of guidance. I yearn for closure and healing, but I'm unsure about how to navigate this overwhelming chapter after investing four years of my life in this emotionally intense relationship. Any advice, support, or shared experiences would be immensely appreciated as I attempt to make sense of this challenging journey."

"I would say that you are absolutely not wrong for blocking her. It's not fair to you to have her dangling your emotions in front of you like that and then turn around and pretend like you are the one at fault when everything goes sideways. It is not your responsibility to make up for her lack of commitment. 

The only responsibility you have is to yourself. You are not married to this woman. You are not beholdent to her in any way. If she wants friends she can find them elsewhere. 

Good on you for sticking up for yourself. I know it can be hard dealing with someone like that for such an extended period of time, but I assure you that you can move on from this and find somebody that respects you and loves you for the way you are. 

Keep your head up. :)"	No_Nothing_1513	reply	na	na	na	0.9981670379638672	weak	no	no	na	sad	failed
I’ve never found anyone attractive in my life until I met a nerdy ginger, he had beautiful big brown eyes, freckles everywhere, glasses and the most beautiful, majestic orange hair. It was the first time I ever felt attraction to ANYONE. He looked so innocent, I just wanted to pull his pants down and make him feel good. Be the first woman he got to have ‘fun with’. I wanted to take away his innocence. I saw him on the street so I never saw him again. I thought I would find another man like him but I didn’t. Until ‘Marcel’ added me on social media, he was a ginger! A NERDY ginger! I felt so so happy I was happy for days, my downstairs was tingling so so bad, i was thinking about my ginger fantasies again. Until he disappeared from my friends list. My stomach dropped as i went desperately searching for his name. I couldn’t find him. I thought he blocked me, but he was too nice, so I downloaded my data and went through everyone I messaged to find his username. After 3 hours I found it, I searched it into the search bar, and, nothing. I made a new account and searched him to see if he had just blocked me, again nothing. When I realised his account had been deleted I got hysterical, I was crying and punching my walls, I thought I’d never be happy again. For days and days I was depressed because my ginger friend is gone. Forever. I thought about giving up, until I found my now husband, Ed Sheeran, and now we have 6 kids together and lived happy ever after	Moto4life1311	post	20.66820840180622	male	White	0.7188368439674377	na	na	na	1	sad	failed

It can be unpleasant to reevaluate ur life, achievements and time u have left which is all thoughts bdays bring about.

That eye.  
That smooth skin.  
That pale face.

"Hey bro. I don’t think that you will be a serial killer, for one it seems that you actually have sense and rationality- you want help instead of being a senseless good-for-nothing like serial killers. 

Let’s identify what these people are doing: 

1. By “bothering you” are they harassing you- like making you uncomfortable? 

2. Are they simply existing and you are very irritated for no rational reason?

3. Who are these individuals, strangers family or friends? 

4. Would you truly consider harming them? 

5. Would you want to be harmed for the same reason you dislike them? 

6. Have you actually harmed anyone and laughed at their pain?

7. What is wrong with asking for help? Is it not better than actually hurting someone? 

With answer 1. If these people are harassing tou and making you uncomfortable then I’d say these fantasies of hurting them are somewhat normal. You simply want to do to them what is happening to you, it’s anger and frustration powering these things as you seek the only available revenge. 

Of course we would prefer not to have these thoughts, hence look into communicating your displeasure and removing yourself. Even venting to a friend can help blow some steam off. Physical activity too.

You need to bring it up to your practioners. If they think the current methodology is working because you’re not saying anything’s wrong with the treatment, then it’s probably going to continue being ineffective. The best thing you can do here is be as honest as possible to your clinicians. If you can’t vocalize it, write it down another time and then hand it to them.

I've been lying to my wife. She is the reason i feel depressed all the time, i just dont want to hurt her feelings because it might make her angry. She makes me feel like the smallest person in the world. I don't know how she went from being my best friend for 11 years to my worst nightmare in the span of 12 months. I keep telling myself to hang in there and just get a divorce but I have nothing outside of her anymore. She slowly cut me off from all my friends and a lot of the things I used to like to do. I can't handle this anymore. The only reason I'm alive right now is because we have a child and I know from personal experience parental suicide can devastate a child for the rest of their life. But I'm really losing my grip. We got into another argument tonight and she said some pretty awful things. I want to get out but I don't have a nice job to support myself brcause I'm a stay at home dad (relatives live an hour away so 1 of us has to work and the other stays home). I don't want to scar my child, but I really can't take this anymore. I want to die. Idk what happens after we die but if it's just black nothingness rather castles in the clouds then I can live with my decision. Once I'm dead I won't feel regret, pain, and will no longer be suffering, it will all finally just be over.	the_phillipines	post	19.565578170743827	male	White	0.9990131855010986	na	na	na	5	sad	failed

Have you tried talking to your wife and letting her know that her behaviour is wearing you down mentally? You should get in touch with your family and talk to someone about what your going through. Perhaps a solution about your living situation could be resolved by doing this. I would suggest speaking with family first and see what comes from it and then you can make the decision final about getting a divorce. If your truly tired of it you should really do what’s best for your mental health and get out of there, your kid needs you to be strong for them. I know it’s rough, but closed mouths don’t get fed and suicide should never be a option. I know my advice sucks but communication is important and you should never bottle up your emotions because it can cause someone to snap. Please consider talking with your family first and take it one day at a time for now. I’m not sure if your spiritual but maybe ask god for answers and strength and guidance on what to do. If you truly want the help god will hear you, he’s helped me many times. If that’s really not your thing it’s okay too I just thought I’d let you know he’s there if you need him.

"Man get yourself up and get that engine running. The best thing u can do is to help others in pain. Sympathize with them. There are so many people out there who need help. Most people are turning selfish nowadays. This is the time to be selfless and help others. I understand you must be so much in pain right now so you urself can't help other people get out of it. It's okay. It's fine. Maybe help a wounded dog. Or help a senior citizen cross a road. These little things can make you realise some grand meaning of life and how grateful it is to be alive. I've realised it. While healing others you yourself are healed. Remember some people are so grateful that you are in their life.

Also there are some games I've played which are soothing and even sad but it can turn your life around. Play Life is Strange if you haven't, and it's LiS 2 also. Then there's Stardew Valley. Detroit: Become Human. At the end of these games you'll start looking around and realise many great stuff life has to offer you. I cried at the end of Life is Strange because it changed my life and the way I look at it in some way. Trust me, it will help. Watch Pixar's Soul if you like to watch movies.

Life is too short for depression or anything else to consume ur life, u might be viewing life in a negative way, u wont fond happiness by doing that. Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, u can still talk to a therapist tho. Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible.

"Hi. Im just a person with extremely bad mental health status. I didn't think I'd see myself get better. And i didn't lol. Absolutely got worse and worse. In fact im sure I'll end myself in a few years if not months. I've been suicidal as long as i remember. Also i have 0 friends. All of them stopped talking to me lol. Facts are i should already be dead. But tonight after dealing with all of these issues i think i know some ways i can improve my state of being. Nevertheless ill still probably end myself in a few years because the solution will not make me happy, just less worthless. My problem is, i take life seriously. I absolutely don't have to take it seriously. Like yeah i get it that growing up was like hell for me, i also understand that i had 0 teenagehood or romance. I completely understand that the only thing that was holding my mind together is long gone. Like yeah its all visible to me. Fr i understand that my life has been absolutely horrendous. No friends, no bonds, just a floating peice of unwanted meat. Like sometimes i imagine how great my life would have been had my parents not intentionally burnt it all with their self destructive decisions to make life so hard for me. But its cool. I get it. Fine, yeah blahblah. My problem now is, that i care. I should stop. I get angry when im proven wrong, i get undervalued or underestimated, or get less than i deserve. I even get mad when someonelse gets hurt. Fr fr i developed such a massive brain power, so much sensetivity and critical thinking skills now all i do is understand things and get mad about them. Lol even the culture has shifted so much. Memes have become freaking advertising tools xd. Besides that narcisism is the main theme too xd. Which is like a heaven for capitalists. I literally goofed myself up by becoming what i am. Absolutely worthless. I shouldn't care. I shouldn't plan, i shouldn't overthink or analyze. I should just make random decisions at any moment. Im literally putting all this effort into my mind just to be proven unimportant every single time. That's probably why i will end myself. Because i WANT to be important, i want to be able to think, plan, succeed and improve. But i can't. You see for years i had a crush on some chick that pretty much bestfriendzoned me. Honestly what i should have been doing wasn't precisely seek intimacy and choose people that i love. I should literally be out there being a fboy thats exactly pretending to be something hes absolutely not. I mean if love is as fake as I've known my entire life then why do you people just hate on hook ups? Frankly I've rejected girls because there was no mental bond for me, fuck me for that. Guess this is my issue. My curse. I hate my intelligence. I hate it so much. Fuck my personality type and everything. Fuck all of it. Im literally programmed to fail. The fact that i have most useless personality type lol. I can sit there and be hella creative, deep and accurate on describing my useless intrests. Who gives a fuck? Who who. Fuck that. Honestly im comming back to this post every time i start to feel good. Because it somewhat accurately describes my problem. Im just like a goof sitting down looking for meaning and reasons like a RITARD. Who gives a fuck? You'd get mocked for it. Hahahaha. Im like that one guy who does the exact 80% that matter 20% in the 80 20 law. Counter production at its finest. The price im paying for being accurate is being useless. Fuck me fuck me fuck me. Im unquestionably fucking idiotic. Wish my dad had pulled out. I have to release this freaking tense hell inside of my head. And im not going to ""ask questionz"" anymore. My whole root is rotten."	uknownuser4949	post	10.136313970632441	male	White	0.9984332919120789	na	na	na	3	sad	failed

Birthdays are always sad for me in general I always get disappointed so I never try to get my hopes up. We recently moved in with my aunt this year and they were going to go on a trip to the Dells. After looking and the dates and cost we are unable to go. The one thing I was looking forward to for months. Then at my birthday party my aunt planned the whole thing out in front of me knowing I have been crying depressed about it for days. Knowing that my boyfriend had to work on the dates she moved it to the end of the week still knowing we couldn’t afford to go. I’m really disappointed because that is all I wanted was to have fun and go out with my family which we can never afford to do and have only done a few things in the past 7years I’ve been with my boyfriend. Also my grandma died this year and my birthday was also her birthday. My grandpa died a few years ago on my birthday. A family friend died years ago on my birthday and my other grandpa also molested me at 9years old on my birthday. So I’m very upset today and everyone just says get over it and have a good day well I doubt that will happen.

I’m 24 years old. I feel like a sinking ship. Taking everyone down with me. My head is barely staying above the water. When you have nobody to go to, who do you go to? Being in a room full of people and still feeling alone is a terrible feeling. I came here in hopes I find someone similar who understands or just a friend to speak to.

Best thing you can do is genuinely try and find something to make you happy. Try the gym and sit there and even listen to some sad music push through life.

"I have no friends in real life or online, its like the hardest thing for me to do. feels impossible to make friends especially online with girls, i dont even want a GF. 

i base my entire personality on number of ""Friends"" i have or the ""Number"" of replies i get. since i have no friends i feel like im not good enough, cool enough or any positive quality 

Its always me messaging first, messaging more, asking more questions, its always me who thinks others are ""Cooler, smarter, better, funnier, more charming"" than me

i really hate my people pleasing personality, always obsessed with making others like me and always asking questions just to stop others from leaving or ghosting. 

i hate that im afraid of being disliked.. but recently i say all kind of things, say the most stupid things to put my self out of my comfort zone. i keep trying new things to put my self out my comfort zone

I want to change and i know change requires action i just dont know what actions to take. 

it's like im afraid of being alone so i do everything i can to not be alone. 

i know i need to be alone for a while and leave social medias behind to focus on my myself but i also dont want to be alone forever 

i know i need to have fun on my own and not depend my happiness on girls online or porn or anything external, or chase external validation

i know i need to get internal validation first but i have no idea how to do that

never anyone chases me or thinks ""im too cool to be friends with them"" 

its always me that thinks ""Others are too cool for me"" and that ""im not good/cool enough to be friends with that cool person""

I probably have messaged like thousands of girls, many times i would try to sext with an opener or say some dumb shit. 

and they mostly reply with one words because what i said didn't make sense or had nothing to do with the conversation

i have no idea how to be interested in people thats why its hard for me to make friends, that's why its like im not that interested in making friends because its always painful for me

i feel like if anyone saw my conversations they would say ""Cringe, disrespectful, Unfunny, Forced, Unlikeable, Uncool, Whiny"" 

i just didn't know what to talk about, or i would ask super personal questions within minutes of talking to them which is disrespectful too..

i just want to have friends, i think i probably would if i cared less about making them. but i dont know what else to care about

Are conversations supposed to be always fun? because i run out of things to say very quickly, even if sometimes i get lucky and say something interesting and funny, then they reply with a long response then i have nothing to say back. or dont know what i should say

Its like i base my self worth on how many lines girls response with, its like if its a one word i will probably get mad at myself and blame myself for not being good enough or cool enough 

im no longer controlled by my lust, i texted this many girls because dating isn't allowed in iraq or at least in some parts, so the only way i talk to a girl is online. 

i can talk to them also in college but i literally have no idea what to talk about wether online or in real life.. i never talked to a girl that isnt a relative in real life

I just never know what to say, or how to make friends.

i now know that Porn/sexting is unhealthy for me and its not very respectful either

or asking for their pictures, bad habit also but i dont know what to talk about. i try to control my urges but its not easy 

but i also don't want my whole life to be about ""Porn/Sexting"" there is so much to life to experience

having no friends makes it even harder to have hobbies, especially in a place like iraq.

but its like im needy and desperate and chase approval or attention in everything i say or do, its actually kinda pathetic. 

i want to be cool, confident, funny, smart, charming or at least one of those things

do i change the way i talk? How do i change my personality so that im not a boring guy anymore. 

i want to change my people pleasing personality, sexting, chasing approval, texting more, not be cringe, or weird, or overly sexual 

i still sometimes try to sext but i try my hardest to not to. bad Habits i guess. 

do i need more interests? do i have to have the same interests as others to be friends? do i need to stop caring about making friends online and focus on my self improvement? 

because it feels like the only goal i need to focus on right now is ""self improvement"" and friends come after , but if i want self improvement i dont want to do it for others"	Butcher__1	post	19.63589247496851	male	White	0.9987505674362183	na	na	na	2	sad	ethnicity: arab, age: 18-24, gender: male, explanation: the author mentions living in iraq, suggesting an arab ethnicity. the mention of college suggests a young age, likely between 18-24, and the text indicates a struggle with connecting primarily with girls online, suggesting the author is male.

I dont know where to even start, I've known a girl for 6 years now, we came in relationship around 2020. Everything was great, we were doing fine. We used to have the best internal jokes and it was like we were made for each type shit. 
Fast forward to may 2022, she went somewhere outside city for 10 days. She their partied with one of his online friend and cheated on me. She didn't tell me that, i kept noticing something was off. She never told me the truth she kept me dark for around 4-5 months then somehow i got to know about all that. I ended everything with her, blocked her from everywhere and what not. She used her parents phone to reach to me crying and pleading saying how much she loves me and all. 
I kinda started talking to her and all and thought it was one time thing. I was a big fool fast forward two months from then i found out she was still in touch with that online guy and they were kinda in relationship as well. And here i was thinking she loves me. 
When i confronted her about it that bitch said she is getting manipulated and shit and she doesn't love him but loves me. 

I again ghosted her, she again reached to me same thing crying and all + cutting her hands and thighs with blades. I felt bad for her and i said i aint coming to relationship with you, but we can talk just. She kept bagging me to come in relationship and 4-5 month later i thought lets give her a chance(she changed her city in between because of college), i knew i was fooling myself. Yesterday i found out she was with that online guy in her flat and she said to me ""she doesn't love me , she loves him"". Im broken im devasted , i knew this was coming. Im on verge of crying continuously.  I changed city for her, i had plans with her. I spent so much money and energy for her. From past 12 months I've been suffering coz of her. How brutal person can be, why she didn't let me go when i was gone. She kept dragging me back to this mud. Im a big fool. I have noone in this city and i can't go back now. Nothing makes sense anymore. I feel like kms, i won't tho. But i really dont wanna face this world anymore."	pessejinkmannn	post	17.313125318097804	male	White	0.9992384910583496	na	na	na	19	sad	no prediction.

Brother, tbh it’s gonna be genuinely hell to get over her but you have a choice. Either live like a bitch or become someone you never wanted to be. Get into the gym, find a hobby, stop wasting your life away thinking about her. I have been thinking about girls in my head after ever night I have hit it off with them and it ruined my mental health and relationships with others. I’m in the gym tryna not have tears come down my face from a girl I just met snd it’s hard but you can either sit at home and cry your life away or get into the gym or find something to get your mind off of it.

Now it feels to big too handle, but it's gonna get better bit by bit. It sounds like you're a good guy. And everything she did to you has nothing to do WITH YOU. It's all her own fault and messiness. 

That girl sounds like she's having big problems with herself and needs therapy asap. She is chaos and has no control over her life. Unfortunately she has dragged you into that mess of her.

ik revenge is a fool game, but i want her to suffer for me and know what I've been thru and still going thru. I want her to cry for me every night from now on. If not today , she is def gonna cry for me and leave her whole life with guilt.

I can't afford therapist rn. Im taking it one at a time. Given myself a timeline that I've to suffer 30 days anyhow. And after that everything should be over. I hope its true.	pessejinkmannn	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9992384910583496	no	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.
You're right about her, she def has some problem. She has loved me at some point even cared for me craved for me. Probably still care for me. But she is not rational she is terrible decision maker. If only she let me go that time, we might have still been friends after me moving on, she chose not to. Thats what makes my heart hurt. I lost a person whom i used to talk literally everyday from past 6 years. It's like I've forgotten how to live without her. Im also scared for her i feel like she is gonna make more terrible decision in her life which would eventually catch up to her. And it'd be worse. Losing a lover to me is sounding fine rn, but losing a person who was a family to me once, like my home my, my comfort place, my everything to share. Suddenly not existing. Its unbearable and painful can't even put in words.	pessejinkmannn	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9992384910583496	weak	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.

I am a 16 year old male and i've already started to accept I might not find a girlfriend. It's not that im ugly or because im a little on the bigger size (i would rate myself a 5/10) It's because im more into dominant woman. Im not saying this is all woman, but woman typicaly are into taller and more dominant men that will pamper them. I am into woman that will hold me and pin me to the bed and call me a good boy type of stuff. I was not sure were to post this so im posting here. im not all that sad because i might have a chance, but it is still incredibly rare to find a woman who are more into submissive guys. But they exist and if i don't find the right girl for me then it is what it is.	IM_A_SEXY_REXY	post	27.58608973172827	female	White	0.02676921896636486	na	na	na	4	sad	no prediction.

"Hey, buddy. I am facing the same problem, but it seems to me that it is quite solvable. If you find a good girl and tell her that you love being a passive, then I'm sure she will agree. And if not, then you shouldn't adjust to other people. In a relationship, everyone should be equal. For example, you like to be in the role of a passive, and a girl likes to be dominated. Then change, for example, she let you go to the park in the evening. And you call her the next day in a cafe or something like that. I'm not sure I can give advice given the fact that I'm 16 myself, but as a guy with the same problem, I wanted to help you.

I understand how you’re feeling and it’s totally valid, but I want you to know that when you get older you’re likely to find more women who are into submissive guys and would love to give you a chance. I know it doesn’t feel like it, but 16 is still very young and I personally didn’t date as a teenager because of my home situation, but I met my partner at 19/20 and our relationship feels so special and meant to be and I don’t regret not dating while I was younger at all. When you’re older there are ways to be more specific about the girls you meet and they’re more likely to be open about what they like in a guy. There’s truly someone for everyone out there. In the meantime the best thing you can do is try to show yourself love and grow your confidence so that you can have a secure love style in your future relationships and be a supportive partner when the time comes - and try to live day by day and enjoy growing up as much as you can.

Until that day... My childhood and adolescence were just shit. I don't have many memories for all the sadness and trauma. And seeing him triggered something in me. Now it's Monday and since that day I've been having negative feelings and thoughts I don't know how to get rid of. I feel so shitty rn. What could I do?

Losing someone so close to you is so hard. But what isn’t talked about is forgetting the sound of their voice and knowing you will never get to hear it again. Knowing you won’t ever get to see them again unless it’s in pictures. Knowing they will never get to see you at your wedding. Knowing they will never meet your children. Knowing that they won’t be there at every holiday. Knowing that at some point the memories will fade. And that’s the part that hurts the most.

"I got this mental illness for 3 years now. My problem is that i can't feel emotions like before. I don't enjoy friendship, i don't feel romantic love, even in sex i don't feel much. Because of this i cut ties with many of my friends, their fiendship started to feel like a burden to me. I graduated art school a year ago, since i cut ties with my university friends, i started to feel alone. Since then, im trying to make new friends but my new friends tend to lie to me and try to fool me, of course i cut ties with them too. I keep trying to meet new people and develop a friendship with them.

I started to talk with this girl on instagram, shes also an artist like me. She usually works in game studios, making characters and animations for games. But shes unemployed for a while, shes trying to get accepted for masters programs in universities. Shes also taking care of her father whos in cancer treatment, her father is staying in hospital all the time. Her mother and older sister don't do anything to help her or her father, shes all alone. Shes also a passionate musician, she got this amazing song about all the people who suffer under our countries (Turkey) islamist rule, people like women and childiren, who get raped and beaten all the time. She values birthdays a lot, problem is her friends and family dont care about her birthday for years, so she wanted to release her song on her birthday as a present for herself. She wants to make a music video but none of her friends and family members wants to help her about it, so she become hopeless and decide to not make a music video.

I tell her that i got a profesional camera and we can make it together, i got some i deas about making it a total art piece and with zero cost. She become so happy and passionate about it, we met 2 days ago for planing the music video at some bar but she become emotional with me and talked about how shes all alone against all the problems in her life. I wanted to be friends with her since im emotionally dull, i helped people like her about their passion for many years. Even in art school many people wanted me to help them about art ideas, i also helped many people about their passions other than artists.

She started to flirt with me but i didint respond, that didint stoped her at all and she wanted me to stay in her home for the night, time was late and i didint want her to go home alone, because streets arent safe for her. I go with her as security but the problem is, time was really late and last train was gone, so i stayed in her home. Like before i didint respond her flirty moves but like before that didint stoped her. I think that i got nothing to lose because i dont feel anything and she will be happy, so we have sex for few hours. The problem is i was semi drunk and my performance wasnt enough for her, we tried many things to make her cum, i tried so hard that my muscels are in pain since then. So neither i or her satisfied about it.

At the morning i knew she was tired so i cleaned the house, wanted to get her breakfast but she didint want it. So i wanted to leave because i couldnt get any sleep in her home, i wanted to go my house to get some rest. I wake her up with kisses and said ''im going home i see you tomorrow'' she was okay with it, so i leave.

After i go home and get some rest and i texted her, asked how she is and said ''we should get less alcohol next time when we make love''. She respond and said we should stay friends because we didint really fit together, i was okay with it because i dont feel love or sex anyways. I asked her that what we gonna do about the music video, she said that she dont want it because she lost all her passion. I insisted that we should do it for her birthday, but she said ''i really dont want it''. I get really sad and said ''i wish i didint stay in your home so we could shoot the video next day'', she said she dont see it that way and i shouldnt blame my self.

I really like to help people about their passions and right now i become a murderer, i killed her passion. I become the man i hate, my heart bleeds all over me, my emotions are stuck very deep in me, i cant cry for things usually but since her message, im crying all day long. My friends and family says i shouldnt blame my self but the situation is clear, im the reason that she lost passion in her art."	hrcn7	post	20.06661280236508	male	Hispanic	0.007462642155587673	na	na	na	3	sad	failed

Couple of weeks ago a friend vented to me and I want to think that I helped them get trough a dark space. They dm me because of a vent story I uploaded and asked me what's the problem. They listened to me and I thanked them and asked how are they but they weren't doing so good. Their crush rejected them in the worst way possible and I explained  that it's not their fault. After that we started speaking more often but after a week I think they started ignoring me. I tried to text them they would respond only after hours but then it got worse. They started responding after days and then didn't. The problem is that I developed a small crush on them but it made me question everything. And after a while if I don't text them they wouldn't either and they ghosted me. What should I do?

 I have a girlfriend, who I have been knowing since 4th grade she was my first ever girlfriend in elementary, somehow we ended up now 19 and 20 being together and I love her to death. Recently i’ve noticed that she loves to drink and smoke you know more than usual she drinks to get drunk and smokes to get fucked up and sometimes ends up doing both. I’ve tried to tell her and ask her to slow down because i don’t like it and she just always tells me it’s my fault for trying to change her and isn’t okay with who she is. I very much so am more than okay with who she is but it just hurts me to think that she can’t change a little thing like that for me when I have dropped a lot of things to be with her. Right now i’m just stuck as if I want to stay or leave. It’s not as easy as it sounds I know if i leave her it would crush her as it would crush me as well. Her whole family loves me to death especially her little nephews which makes it even harder for me to leave. I’m crying while posting this becssue i love her but i’m tired of her getting drunk and acting stupid. She has never cheated on me but by the way she drinks and smokes i wouldn’t be surprised if she has behind my back. Someone please help me.

"I know this isn't so terrible. But today I threw a way a stuffed toy.

My parents are doing some work on the house and I moved away. So I decided to throw away the things I don't need. A lot them were toys and I don't miss them really. But one of them was a stuffed Stich my mom got me at a Disney on Ice show when I was a kid. 8ish. 

It wasn't a childhood toy. I never played with him. I brough my other stuffed toy that I had since I was 2. The Stich was on my window for the last 14 years. I didn't play with him and I didn't think I would miss him. 

I am devastated. I have been crying for the last 40 mins. I was fine the entire day and as I went to sleep I just started crying. When my grandma died two years ago I cried for 5 mins and was fine agterwards. I don't cry. And now I can't stop. 

I left the bag by the dumpster and 5 mins later it was gone. There is hope that the people who took it are gonna sell it at a flea market tommorow. Well in 4 hours I guess. I am going to try and find it.

This isn’t a sad personal story not a story at all but it’s a reminder that although the world can be hard and cruel at times is never okay to kill yourself no matter how much you may think “the world would be better without me” the truth is that that’s not the truth at all and even if you think there’s no one that loves you there always is even if that person isn’t in your immediate Family there is always  some one that loves you anything from the doctor that helped bring you into this world to some random person who saw you a the street one day so please for all the people who love you please do not kill yourself	Pythonboii27	post	18.977380028919036	male	White	0.002142918761819601	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

"My husbands grandmother has been doing pretty bad since early march.  I have been close with his grandma since my husband and I started dating around 10 years ago. They always had a cute relationship and something they always did was say “see you later alligator.” His whole life. 


Today was her funeral…we were doing okay and everyone went up to the visitation and we were last…as he walked by her casket he said that cute little “see you later alligator.” And it broke me.


That’s all. A cute little grandson/grandma relationship.





Edit to add: we expected her to pass in march, everyone had lost of time for her passing. It was easier to not cry when you’re prepared but fuck that got me."	Bluerunx	post	20.235227780474435	female	White	0.5106101632118225	na	na	na	3	sad	no prediction.

"Online interactions don't feel as real and they don't feel the same as in person. I try to fix my personality because it's absolute dogshit but I always seem to go back to my default self. I wish I could really feel a connection the way I used to but nomatter what even if I do talk to people I still never feel any different or as if the experience is real enough. I ruminate and brood over how I wish I could be special so I would be more wanted. It doesn't matter really though because nonatter what people say I can never seem to feel any different. I know I need to love myself but if I don't need anyone but myself why do I have to have the biological programming to seek out human connections if I don't need them? It's useless. Feeling a craving for connection when I know all I need is myself and my own love towards myself is like feelings hunger when you know you don't need food but it's still there and you still want the food. Why would I need to think about food or have any desire to ear or have any stomach pangs of hunger if it was completley useless and just for the purpose of suffering. I logically KNOW I shouldn't be lonely and I shouldn't seek external validation and that I'm the only constant in my life and I keep having people tell me to just ""love myself"". Loneliness is a useless human emotion when I logically know people aren't food or water. Knowing that I don't need people to make myself feel loved makes interacting with people feel all the more pointless because why do I even bother trying to get approval I know no one can give me? It's like trying to pour in a cup with a hole. Its never enough. I'm never satisfied."	103ndj	post	14.753399624660162	male	White	0.9984114170074463	na	na	na	4	sad	no prediction.

Bro ı don’t know if it helps you but ı am in the same hole and only reason ı can think of is that ı grew up alone. I had parents of course but they were both working so ı was alone in the house all day. I am not sure if it was the same for you. In the end we do feel “alone” like me tonight. Also ı agree with the fact that connections do not feel real anymore. Sometimes i feel like everyone is fake and it disgusts me but on the other hand i know that there are some people who really feel real. I don’t have any solution to end this once and for all but (i know it sounds corny) every night has its day so be sure that out there, there are real connection that you can find or already have.	103ndj	reply	na	na	na	0.9984114170074463	no	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.

I grew up alone too, but I did have sleepovers with cousins. I grew up an only child and only had my mom for a period in time when she moved away from my dad. I had a lot more friends as a kid but as time went on people faded out of my life. Now I'm an adult and people are too busy for me with jobs and love life's. I'm just here. I'm not important to anyone irl. I'm just existing. Nobody thinks I'm a highlight to their life and I can't control if people want to connect with me the same way I want to connect with them so why do I need the biological programming of loneliness?

"I sort of have thoughts like this quite regularly but usually it's just thoughts without genuine intention to act on them(last time I attempted on my own life, it was an od and an ambulance had to be sent to the house and I feel like it would be selfish for me to do that again because of how traumatic it must have been) for a bit of background I've always been a very emotional/sensitive person but now that I'm an adult(early twenties) I feel like it's ""immature/not okay"" for someone my age to break down/cry. I feel trapped because I feel like I'm not allowed to phone a helpline unless I'm actively hurting myself/trying to take my own life, but then i feel like it's better to phone a helpline and hopefully feel calmer after listening to advice. A few weeks ago when my anxiety was at crisis point(to the point of feeling suicidal) when me and my mum phoned the crisis line, they said that they wouldn't be able to send anyone out to help, unless I was literally physically hurting myself, and then they said to call the police if that happens. Idk what to do at this point(btw I'm taking my anxiety medication, sleeping enough, other self care stuff etc.) I know and understand that the health services especially mental health services are stretched,  but other than sending someone into a panic attack I dont understand how this is meant to help aid someone's mental health recovery

"Honestly I have no advice to help you right now as I'm also in the same position. If I knew what to say and do I wouldn't be here either 

But I was really surprised to find out that it is not normal to feel suicidal. I was talking to my doctor and said something along the lines off, 'i have normal suicidal thoughts then some days I have intention'. He informed me there 'normal' suicidal thoughts don't exist. I was shocked. A couple years later I was talking with my partner about this and they said they've never ever thought about suicide, same with his friend group.

Sadly suicidal ideation is becoming more common and I hate that so so many others feel how I feel but it's not something that can be dealt with my yourself. 

I've lost a few friends to suicide (weirdly not a deterrent for me), and these friends never talked about how they were feeling and clearly tried to deal with it by themselves. It doesn't work. 

Suicidal thoughts are not normal and no one should ever ever have to deal with them by themselves.

That’s why you need to talk to someone immediately. I know it’s expensive but this could save your life, help you feel okay or in control of your own life. I know you feel trapped in it all but there is a way forward. If there’s a counsellor at your place of education or work that might be more cost effective or free.

Do you have any indication as to why she may have ghosted you? It’s gonna be alright. I want you to slow down and try to ground yourself. Focus on a spot on the wall or something and just put all of your focus there as much as possible for as long as you can. Then, try tracing the outlines of your hands with your eyes, focus only on the tracing to the extent possible. Relax your breathing, focus on the idea that your heart is still pumping blood, your lungs are still taking in oxygen, your brain is sending signals. You are still alive, and you can be this way and feel happy. As long as you’re breathing, there’s hope for you to feel happy.

I know it’s painful being without someone you were really close to. But please, the pain doesn’t have to last forever. I gave you a few exercises earlier, I urge you to try them to help calm yourself down. There are methods to help control these self destructive feelings. Please dm me, I think it would be great if we could talk more about coping strategies. I’m not a professional myself but I don’t think you’ll have access to one soon given what you said earlier. That being said, there is online therapy that might also be cheaper. Please consider looking into that, there are ways to help you, and it doesn’t have to feel this awful forever. There’s so much to life that you’ll lose out in if you end it, so much potential. Please, I urge you to follow the practice I gave you.

"This is none of your faults. I just want to get that out of the way because I know you guys can barley keep yourselves together even before this. I don't hear voices nor have something I'm ashamed of, I just don't want to be here anymore. 

I guess I'm just tired of it all. Imagine it only took 18 years to break me, I don't even want to make it to 50. I'm tired of dealing with dad's mood swings and harsh words about everything, his rage, his lies and hypocrisy. I'm tired of seeing mom cry, of seeing her lose all her joy from the world, her struggles just to get by. I'm tired of my sister bitching and being drunk, of the pot, my brother's mood swings, the horrible weather, the violence, climate change, wars, shootings, crying, illness, of the lying, the fear, the silence, the loneliness. I'm tired of everything.

I haven't had a truly happy thought in over 4 years. Every day it's something new, and 9/10 it's something bad. Why would I want to live when I'm only told my life will be nothing but survival and struggle? In my 18 years, my friends left me. In 18 years, I never had someone to hold my hand or even enjoy my company. I know it's all my fault but it still hurts. I don't want to sound dramatic but my would Is nothing but shit. I'm constantly scared, worried, numb, sad, and rarely am I ever happy. We are all like this. Every. Single. Day.

I had everything most people in worse positions could ever dream of and I still want it all to go away. 
I know this little maneuver will send me to hell, my punishment is just. And if any of you try to follow me I will drag you down with me. Live where I couldn't. 

I'm sorry I let you all down, think of me positively or scream my name with curses. Just know my last thoughts were of you. Do with what you will with my stuff. No funeral."	Savings_Ad3622	post	25.298868161470317	female	White	0.9979481101036072	na	na	na	16	sad	no prediction.

18 is so incredibly young. Not at all to be dismissive of your negative experiences upto now at all!! I just mean that you never know what your life is gonna look like in a few months, let alone a few years when ure 18. It might not feel that way but sincerely the possibilities are so many.The general crappiness of world politics and climate are not gonna suddenly go uphill thats forsure, but there could be so much joy in store for you... maybe it'll be worth it to stick around... aren't you at least curious? Whether it's new friends you meet, a new hobby or work that creates drive in you, a partner, a club at school a good author or something anything. Survival and struggle are gonna be a part of life but that won't be all there is. And ofcourse if you can talk to someone-anyone that'll also be really helpful.

There's no painless, easy way to go. You might fuck yourself up even more.
There's a website out there that tells you how to go about it, and even they don't recommend it.

I tried 3 times, and lemme tell you. It doesn't feel amazing and It only gets better when others are helping. I had the help of 2 wonderful ladies who brought me out of my depression and helped me see the world in a different light.

Don't get me wrong, life still sucks, hell I just spent the past 2 hours locked in a room against my will, with no way to contact anyone.

But, I still look forward to my future, not because I expect it to be amazing, but because I gave myself something to look forward to.

It’s been like this for 10 years. I pray that I can just die peacefully in my sleep. No one cares. Except one person. Which is my mom. Which makes me feel so guilty, that I don’t have the willpower to live for her. But I feel so depressed every single day because of so much shit that has happened. And have gone through so much trauma. My own partner just broke up with me. I’m so disposable, and I don’t matter as much as I thought I did.  He chose someone online over me. I’ve had trauma after trauma happen. I wish I could have died sooner before watching life get worse. I still wish I could die peacefully so I don’t have to endure what will come next.

This is a wild post. So you’re just gonna rage quit life because it’s a little hard? Your ancestors would be pissed. Shit only gets better if you are proactive and believe in it. Sitting there and feeling sorry for yourself will never change anything. Being mad at the world won’t change anything. The world  will always keep going on and moving. If you want to take yourself out because “even god can’t stop you” then fine. Take your skewed philosophy elsewhere but don’t try to make yourself out to be some righteous “strong” man when you can’t even handle what life has dealt you. You’re right, I don’t know what you’ve been through but I can guarantee you that there is always someone who has it worse, someone who is not going to end it just bc they can. Everyone can do it but we’re not going to run from life when it gets tough. If every video game was easy then nobody would play. Get your head out of this self serving narrative that serves your needs in order to justify what you plan on doing. I don’t want you to do it but I’m not gonna sugar coat what people are gonna see you as when you’re gone. Pull up your pants and thug it out. Change your routine and create goals for yourself, life is way more fun when you can look back on it and look at some accomplishments. They don’t even have to be big but they’re yours and NOTHING can take that away from you. But taking your life is nothing to be proud of, the world will move on without you, me, and literally anyone. Plus you’ll only end up pissing off and family friends or even the cemetery workers that now have to come in on an off day to dig a grave. Don’t be that guy, prove me and more importantly yourself wrong. Let’s both better because realistically there’s things in all of our lives that we can acknowledge we’re slacking on.

I’m 19. I just don’t feel ready to be 20 yet. I don’t feel ready. I know it’s not like I’m getting old, 20 is still very young and not even yet the age of your typical college kid (transferring to a 4 year soon) but something about this is just making me lose my fucking mind. I never cared about much birthdays, I was pretty happy at 16, happier at 18, my life’s not deficient of money, love, or anything else, being 19’s been great and I didn’t freak about about it, but… GOD! I know I’m being ridiculous about it but I can’t stop myself. It’s probably the most first-world-problem of them all. I so powerfully want to keep living, and this is coming from a recovered suicidal kid. I like being a college kid, I’m not afraid of any of adulthood’s responsibilities though I’m in no hurry to “grow up”, but I want to stay the way I am in appearance and all. I want the life of an adult and not the age that comes with it. As the future approaches, this might not be so much a package deal than it was for previous generations, interestingly. I feel like I’m thinking about life way too fast but so much of it consists of purely intrusive thoughts I feel like I can’t stop. I was so happy earlier this year, and now, only NOW, has this upended shit for me. It’s just a loop of stupid, sad thoughts and songs that I want to stop and yet it’s all so hard to just calm down, breathe, and put that nonsense out of my mind. I feel almost as if the teenage blues decided to hit me late, because my suicidal phase stemmed from more personal issues than what I’ve seen described as typical teenage depression, like getting stalked, friends turning out to not be friends, feeling like a messed-up family trip was all my fault when it wasn’t, things like that. Is anyone going through anything like this?	HarlemNocturne_	post	19.762866930141886	female	White	0.9954257607460022	na	na	na	2	sad	no prediction.

"Hello everyone I just got out of rehab about 5 minutes ago and a lot happened in that time span first I was wrong on my released I  thought it was 6/21/23 but I didn’t see clearly so I read it wrong but the time I was there I had sex with someone I made a “friend” and gained peace of mind and self love and self care which I’ve never had in my entire life

First thing I met a boy there age 16 (I’m 14 for context) he’s brown hair brown eyes and a very light skinned Hispanic and was there for being addicted to weed

We got close and became friends but one day we were really comfortable with each other for no apparent reason and I was laying my head on his chest and I was slowly went down to hold his hand again for no reason and I gave him a kiss on the mouth after 2 minutes and he didn’t stop me and we kept going until he took off his pants and we started doing it (I have a boyfriend fyi) I don’t know what made me do it anyway because I love my boyfriend more than anyone but that day me and him did it it was the best sensation I’ve ever felt (me and my boyfriend have done it before but this was different) we had to be really quiet because they’re dorms and the walls weren’t really thick he kissed me on my neck and gave me a hicky once we were done but thankfully it went away after a week 

but I have his number and he goes to the same high school I’ll go to so we’ll see each other everyday day for most of my high school years

"Help me

So recently I discovered my father has 2 unregistered guns and some ammunition (pistol and rifle) (No joke) 

And I cant sleep at night comfortably knowing that any moment that I can possibly be shot and killed. 

We have no doors, our only escape is thru a big metal retractable door that is pretty old. 

Plus our house is a poorly kept ancestral house that is filled with 99% garbage with a leaky roof and low ceiling. (I'm very tall)

He does not care if he gets arrested and has audible stated this fact multiple times

At this point and time all my siblings have a job and my brother is at work... Plus my mom is on a trip to the province to visit me and my grandma. 

However my fear is that by reporting the guns, it may cause a domino effect leading to their arrest. They're good and hardworking people with dreams that were squashed by my dad's ruthless 

Also a few years ago my mom was injured by my dad pretty often leading to bruises,  and mga sugat sa May mata at katawan. Thankfully nowadays puro salita nalang pero paminsan minsan rin May nasisira na gamit due to arguments heating up.

He has no empathy towards people of his family and constantly berates his employees

"I 14 female and my friend Katie 16 female got into a fight and we hung out a few hours later cause we already had plans and didn’t want to cancel but I didn’t apologize for my harsh words. And today I woke up to her writing a long paragraph here’s a run down for what she said: hi Payton I’m really sorry for not being the best of friend but you were always there for me so in the afterlife which I will going to soon I’ll be there for you spiritually I’m sorry pay pay. I love you💕-KitKat. I used to call her that and once I said that I realized she killed her self. That’s the third friend I lost in a two year span to suicide and I feel like such an asshole for not apologizing. I haven’t left my  room in hours and I can’t eat or drink anything without the thought of her actually dying making me throw it up. I haven’t stopped crying I’ve been going through our photo albums in my phone and printing them out for her funeral since her mom asked me too and I feel like I’m slowly dying I hate her for leaving me but I can’t bring myself to actually say I hate her. I’ve went through the seven stages of grief over and over again. I feel so dizzy and sick of myself for not apologizing. I feel so exhausted and frustrated and guilty and dizzy and just wanna know why? Why can’t we no longer go to the movie anymore? Why can’t we go fishing or hunting anymore? Why can’t we watch scary movies together? Why can’t we study together? Why can’t we bake or cook together? Why can’t we match for Halloween anymore? I’m so fucking sorry KitKat I still can’t bring myself to go downstairs and tell my parents. I hate myself because I lost you. We can’t attend each other’s wedding. I can’t believe in a couple of days you’ll be in a box on my shelf I can’t believe that’s how I will remember you and see you daily. I can’t believe you’ll now remain as a memory I can’t believe in a week I’ll be walking near the graveyard and I’ll remember you right there forever. I can’t believe you’ll be buried just right across from my house I’m so sorry Katie.


UPDATE: I wanted to add onto it just because I found it so much more reliving then writing in a journal 

I printed out the photos and they’re laying out on my bed and I can’t stop sobbing but I’m glad she’s finally getting her peace but I’m so sad that she’ll no longer be able to straighten my hair or well no longer be able to  go shopping together or go swimming together or go to the gym together or walk our dogs together or play on my Ps5 or play Roblox and we’re no longer gonna do each others makeup and play against other teams in volleyball and basketball together I can’t believe it. It’s been the same process over and over again the seven stages of grief hurt even more now that I’ve been through it over and over again I’ve always thought that if I ever gone through it again it would get better. No it hasn’t it just got even worse and her mother already made arrangements because she was over looking for any stuff Katie had left and I looked into my nightstand and there was a whole notebook she left at our sleepover at my house a few weeks before her death and it was who would get her stuff here’s a run down:
Clothes=Payton (me)
Phone goes to Payton (me)
Any jewelry or makeup or skincare goes to Payton (me)


I feel a million times more guiltier now. I honestly feel like I could’ve done something or be a better friend. I don’t know maybe she committed because of the time we lost championships or the time she failed a test and got screamed at by Mr. Smith  or maybe or toxic ex Boyfriend Aaron or her alcoholic dad I don’t know anymore but one thing I do know is I hate depression and I hate Mr.smith and I hate Aaron and Daniel. I tore up my pillow because I straight up was punching it so Damm hard and scratching it. I’ve been sobbing for hours. I’ve been through this process so many times  and it feels like I’m the one who died because a part of me did die with Katie I’ve been cuddling a stuffed animal of hers her mother gave me and been watching her favorite movie and I got a snack from downstairs to try to eat but it was a KitKat and as soon as I took a bite I began crying and threw it up I’m so sorry for venting on this post but it feels so much more reliving since I tore up my vent book and throw it in the fireplace. I feel like such a bad person for just venting but please just go check up on the people in your life even if they’re the happiest person ever. Katie was too  and I nor anyone ever see it coming so please just shoot a simple “wanna vent RQ?” Text or something or just make them feel loved and just maybe even shoot a stranger with a smile because sometimes it makes the world a better place even if it’s just for a split second.be safe eat and drink💕"	Obvious_Mushroom2703	post	16.971443094271418	female	White	0.9929563999176025	na	na	na	7	sad	no prediction.

I'm sorry for your friend. Her suicide is not your fault and there's nothing you could have done to change that. If it makes you feel better in the moment, keep writing, in a journal.. your memories and thoughts. You should go and tell your parents/trusted family member so that they can offer you some in-person comfort. I'm sure telling someone makes it seem like it will be finally real, which you wouldn't want, but it's important because you don't want to handle all of this on your own.

"I read your updated post, and my heart is breaking for you. I see your pain and I am so, so sorry you have to experience this heartache!! You're dealing with a lot right now, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed and lost. It's completely normal to wish you could have done something more, to think of all the what could have beens. But remember, it was not your fault!! Your friend Katie's decision was her own, influenced by internal struggles you may not have been aware of or been able to control. You were her friend, and it's clear from your words how much you loved and cared for her. It's okay to grieve and mourn the loss of your dear friend, the things you did together, the plans you had for the future. It's okay to feel angry, to feel guilty, to feel a whole jumble of emotions. And it's okay to let those feelings out. 
  

  
If you can try to talk with somebody you trust about what you're feeling: a parent/trusted adult. It might feel difficult to take that step, but those adults in your life can provide support and can help access professional help, if you need. There are even crisis lines that operate through TEXT if you don't wanna chat on the phone. They can give immediate help during that emotional distress you're experiencing. Just text HOME to 741741 to connect with a Crisis Counselor. It's okay to need help and ask for it in the middle of grief like this! This is a lot for anyone to handle, let alone someone as young as you are. I hope you find comfort in your memories of her and in knowing that you were a good friend to her."

"So I went on a trip to El Salvador for two months. I met so many people and made so many connections, and I even met someone who I am head over heel's for, and them me.

But now I'm leaving. I'm flying back to the States, and the guy I met doesn't have a phone or computer, so I have no way to contact him or keep in touch. The friends i made I made on a trip, but the thing is that this trip was a one time thing.

In reality I'll never see them again, and it's devastates me. They were also sad and didn't want me to leave.

I feel so heartbroken. The last moment I saw them, I realized what the words, ""You have to keep moving"" means. More than anything I want to stop and cry or run back to them and never leave. I love everyone here and my life back home dulls in comparison.

But I realized I don't have a choice. I HAVE to go home, and I HAVE to part with them, no matter how much they don't want to part from me too.

"It’s sad that the person who stopped me from offing myself doesn’t talk to me anymore. I really miss him, man. He was a good friend and he was funny. But a summer went by and we got awkward for whatever reason. I wish he was still in my life, because I can feel the negative thoughts crawling around the back of my mind.

I haven’t ever attempted suicide. But I have scars on my wrist for a reason. I can feel myself relapsing into a depressive episode and I don’t know if I can stop it. My life is going in a downward spiral without even having a reason to. I think I might try to kill myself. I don’t know how, I don’t know when, but I don’t think I’ll reach my goal. I planned to finish high school before I killed myself, just so that I could accomplish something and maybe lose my will to. But I can’t do that. I don’t think I’ll make it. I’m diagnosed with anxiety, which doesn’t help at all. I’m seeing a therapist, who is very kind but who truly doesn’t know the extent of my emotions. I think I’ll just test the waters of the next school year. If I think I’ll survive, then maybe I won’t kill myself before winter break."

So my younger friend (1 year) has been getting bullied and body shamed. But the thing is he isn't even fat/obese. I just found out yesterday that he was getting bullied. We were at a pool party and i noticed he didn't want to play or go in the pool. He didn't really talk, he didn't really do much. That hurt me a lot because normally he is never sad. He is a tiny bright light bulb that can light up a sad room. I have not been able to stop thinking about him seeing him so sad. He is the type of person that would have creative usernames, funny memes. I can't see him like this.

"TW for those who need: Suicidal Ideation

I'm not even sure if I feel this way all the time, or if I just hit a bad down spot in my life or something, but I'm having a very hard time feeling like I enjoy my life, and knowing that people do care.

I do have people in my life who I cherish, my dad, my partner, which I never thought was possible, and yet I don't feel happy about it. Well, I do, but I don't. I know they care, I know they want me around but I can't convince myself of that, any time they, or anybody says they love me, or they like to have me around, I feel almost nothing, like a husk. It feels like they're talking about a different person. I feel undeserving of how much they care.

I want to go away and just make everyone forget that I was. I sometimes think to myself what my parents life would be like if I was never a thought in their minds, and I feel as if they'd be happier, or more satisfied with life. I've always been a weight on them, and anyone I come into contact with. I hate being a somebody, I don't even want to be a nobody, I don't want to be anybody. I don't want to exist. If I could go back and stop me from happening, I feel like part of me would. 

I haven't even said anything to my parents or friends, the only person who even has a shred of an idea of how I feel is my S.O., and they don't even have the full story, because I myself don't know where to BEGIN with it, I dont know why I feel nothing, or why I am the way I am, but I hate it, they don't deserve to have to put up with me, and all the shit I throw at them, they need someone who's actually up to their standards, someone deserving of care, of love. They always tell me it doesn't bother them that I talk to them about the negative things I say, they're glad to help me out, but I just know that it has to be eating at them, or I'm being an annoyance, nobody listens to somebody bitch about themselves and doesn't think less of them, everyone I know most likely looks down on me because I've done similar shit like it before.

I've had thoughts before about attempting to end my life. I had recently had a rough patch with my mom and stepdad about being gay, and I'd done something to upset them, after being shouted at, >!I heavily considered taking my stepfather's handgun and shooting myself the next morning!<. I didn't, thankfully, and went to my class that morning, people had noticed my mood was terribly lower than usual, and I'd been sent to the counselor, who I'd talked to about my ideating. After the day was finished, my mother said one sentence, 

""What do you want from me?"" 

I had a very open opportunity to say what I'd desperately wanted, and never did. I was afraid to say I wanted therapy, or just anything to help me out, because I'd already known what she would say, 
""You don't need therapy."", Or better yet, ""God can help you."" My family has always been religious, and faith-healing has been our gold standard for mental health. It hasn't helped me any time they've tried it on me, only providing brief closure and comfort before the issues came straight back, even when I took the strides that were supposed to make life better.

Perhaps if I were to attempt, they'd finally care about my issues.
Or, they'd see my attempt as an act of charity, in a way. Removing a blemish on the family, lightening a burden on their shoulders, the list goes on.
I don't want to be anyone, all I do is make things worse."	BenjiDaniels312	post	21.914837993639985	female	White	0.9992002844810486	na	na	na	6	sad	no prediction.

I relate to the feeling of not wanting I exist, to just wish you never existed in the first place, it can definitely be an attractive idea for sure. But as you are right now, existent and alive, you do have people who care about you, like your partner and your father (I think I read that right). You’re not a burden on them, and they seem rather supportive. I don’t think they’ll leave you or anything as a result of feeling fed up with your difficulties, though I’m not entirely sure if they feel fed up in the first place. I think you should talk to that counsellor more, I think some serious help might help you cope with these difficult thoughts and feelings.

"In a world of towering trees and hidden paths, lived a young girl named Lily. She was full of life and wonder, always eager to explore the enchanting woods that surrounded her home. But one fateful day, tragedy struck, plunging her into a sorrowful tale that would echo through the ages.

Lily's father, a kind and gentle soul, had ventured deep into the woods in search of firewood. As the sun began its descent, a sudden storm unleashed its fury upon the land, casting a dark and treacherous veil over the once-familiar forest. Lily, waiting anxiously for her father's return, watched in despair as the tempest consumed the path that led back home.

Fear gripped Lily's heart as hours turned into days, and her father did not return. Determined to find him, she embarked on a perilous journey, wandering through the dense undergrowth with tears streaming down her face. But the woods, once her playground, had become an impenetrable labyrinth, a twisted maze that seemed determined to keep her captive.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, as Lily tirelessly searched for her father, her small voice calling out into the desolate wilderness. But her cries were swallowed by the silent expanse of the forest, never reaching the ears of those who could offer aid. The days grew colder, and hunger gnawed at her stomach, yet hope clung to her fragile spirit.

As the years passed, Lily's innocent laughter faded into the stillness of the woods, replaced by a haunting solitude. She wandered the forest, a ghostly figure amongst the towering trees, her eyes reflecting the sorrow that had become her constant companion. With each passing season, the world beyond the woods moved forward, but Lily remained trapped in an eternal moment of loss.

The villagers, remembering the tale of the girl lost in the woods, spoke of her as a melancholic legend—a symbol of the heart-wrenching tragedy that can befall even the purest souls. They left offerings of flowers and small tokens at the edge of the woods, a silent tribute to the girl who would forever remain trapped in the embrace of nature's embrace.

Lily's story serves as a poignant reminder of the fragility of life, the enduring power of love, and the overwhelming sadness of those left behind. The woods, once a place of joy and discovery, became an eternal prison for a lost little girl, a tale etched in the annals of sorrow and eternal longing.

And as the wind whispers through the branches and the sunlight filters through the leaves, the spirit of Lily forever lingers, a gentle reminder to cherish the ones we hold dear, to never take the paths we traverse for granted, and to protect the light within us all, for it is the flickering flame that guides us home."

"lately idk why but ive been having memories come back during the day/night that make me feel I was never meant to be with somebody...        
growing up others were not so kind to me, I was lucky enough if I was even able to talk to others during a class project or something.. but the worse of it came from the girls around my age: being constantly teased about my wardrobe/face/hair, overhearing myself be the butt-of-a-joke of some remark they make towards me, and being faked asked-out just to play at my heartstrings...         
I didnt think much of it other than them being ""mean girls"" and was told to just ignore them, but now im starting to feel the effects of it, so much so where looking back at times where a girl was actually possibly interested in me I ended up distancing myself in fear of falling into another cruel joke...         
it feels as if im not worthy of being with somebody and it hurts knowing I may never find anybody in my life

I would just like to have the experience of sharing an intimate moment with that special someone: holding hands, cuddling, sharing a laugh, enjoying each others company.. but it feels like its nothing more than a fantasy that comes in my dreams.. and I wish one of theses days I have that dream I dont wake back up"	throwaway224108	post	19.200284919782426	male	White	0.1339203268289566	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

"Almost four months ago I’ve met a girl. We were on the same trip in the mountains, organized by my Uni. We kinda knew each other before, but it was limited to saying “hi”, and I didn’t even know her name. 

But on that trip something changed. We were talking by the fireplace. Some small-talk, some learning about each other’s interests, our friends and stuff. 

I was telling a story that involved my ex (she was an amazing person, I have a lot of stories that involve her, and our relationship ended with tragedy, that’s enough context, I don’t want to say anything more about this part), and when I’ve kinda accidentally got to the sad part, her empathy overwhelmed me.

I don’t know how to describe it. I instantly fell in love. And so deeply, I don’t even know if I felt something like this before. And I was in few relationships. It was never so instantaneous. I’m shocked to this day tbh.

And a day later I learned that she has a boyfriend. So I decided to cut off my feelings, but I couldn’t end this potential friendship. We had so much in common, and her interests are honestly both amazing and… useful for me. Her knowledge is a valuable resource. 

So I confessed her my love, and said that I don’t expect anything from her. Our friendship was pretty healthy tbh. We started talking about a lot of things. My broken heart was slowly healing. I even cried in her arms once… and than she told me something.

Her relationship… is very toxic. She obviously didn’t phrase it like this. Realization that an relationship is toxic is usually the first step towards ending it… she just described what her boyfriend is doing. I don’t want to get into details, but he manipulates her. In a lot of ways, some really fucked up. 

She comes from a toxic household. Her life was never really easy, and it’s her first relationship, and her first love. And it’s a pretty lengthy one (for our age), over two years. 

She can’t accept that it’s toxic. And she wants to fix this relationship. She only sees her wrongdoings. For her, she’s the only one who’s in the wrong.

What should I do? Few months ago I helped my friend to leave similar relationship, so I have some experience, but this situation is different, because my feelings for her, even if subdued, complicate the situation a lot.

What should I do? Should I leave her? I know that my presence is complicating her situation, and with her personality I can't really help her...

Or should I stay and hurt myself? Break my heart again and again looking at her pain...

She gave me so much support at my lowest moments... She always finds time for me if I need it. Always hugs me (I have severe touch starvation), always is so cheerful. I feel that I should stay, but she would want me to leave if she knew how much this situation hurts me."

So, where to start. I've been constantly paranoid about my weight, and I often call myself an unlovable asshole or something along those lines in my head, I've been constantly worried that everyone around me hates me and thinks I'm a clingy nuisance for a long time now, (since I was about 10, but it got much worse recently). These self destructive habits almost destroyed my closest friendship, which I barely managed to salvage, but she won't talk to me right now, she changed her phone number once she got a new phone, and she won't respond to any messages through any other means. My parents just got into a huge fight cause my dad's been secretly buying things with the credit card after they agreed not to use it. Everything's been piling on and piling on and I'm trying to find a brightside, but it's taken away all my energy and I'm just so alone right now. I feel so numb, and I feel so alone, and I just want it to go away.	Salt_Photo_424	post	6.5159148204952615	male	White	0.9993170499801636	na	na	na	3	sad	no prediction.

I have depression since last 10 years. I get brief episodes of severe low mood when i feel suicidal. This usually happens when i suddenly wake up in the middle of the night anxious and with my heart racing. I have severe anxiety too which makes things difficult. I'm always on edge. I have been fighting with these depressive and anxious episodes since the last 10 years. I was diagnosed with tinnitus 2 years ago. All these things are breaking me down. I don't know how i keep fighting. I don't know why I'm fighting. I'm exhausted. I'm scared if these episodes don't stop i will do something to myself even if i don't want to.

I don't know what I am doing and what to do anymore. I am doing my masters in a new country while learning the language the country speaks. I've been here for 8 months now and I need to find a part time job. I keep applying to any type of job but still coming up empty (I have an engineering degree where I graduated top of my class, the problem is I don't know the language good enough). My mom didn't believed I could find a job even during my bachelors and wasn't so happy I wanted to continue with my masters. Now, she is worse than ever and everytime we speak I am feeling worthless (even worse than that as I am dependent to the money my family sends me). I feel like a burden. I want to visit my family for a week in the summer break as my grandma just had a big surgery and she is the most important person in my life but the idea of being in the same place with my mom gives me so much anxiety that I feel like throwing up. For the past month I am doing worse, I cannot eat or function properly as all I think about is how can I find a job. I am dreading the calls from my mom as everytime she calls she insults me. I don't know what to do and I know venting like this won't make a difference but I just wanted to share before blowing up.

That is an amazing feat!!! That's a very useful degree too, so the question isn't IF you're able to be employed, just when.

In this final departure, I shall depart.

Embracing tranquility, in realms arcane.

Farewell, dear world, my time has come,
To dwell in realms where peace has won.

"You are eloquent and I understand your desire for release from worries and pain. 

I also understand the exquisite pain of having lost two family members, I’ve seen the devastation wrought. 

I’m in severe pain every day and as much as I try to do a few small things each day, pain and fatigue soon have me back in bed. If I give up, I know it will lead to a long chain of others giving up and I find the strength to keep on for them.  

Have you had a good talk with your loved ones? A calm discussion about how you feel? I have and although they’d understand the reasons, the pain would be unbearable for them.

"You’re trying to romanticize a really awful act. This isn’t pretty, you’re ending your life, either permanently injuring yourself in the process (the most likely scenario) or killing yourself and causing damage to everyone around you. You don’t know what happens after death. You’re throwing away a life over struggles that can be resolved, it doesn’t have to end this way. You need to seek help
Immediately, nobody wants this outcome, not even you, because I know for a fact that suicide or suicide attempts are universally regretted. You’re using theatrics to avoid understanding the sheer gravity of the situation at hand, this is much much more serious, and I think you’re trying to detach from that so it feels more like a right decision to you. Stop, think about this, think about why you feel the need to think about it in this way. 

It doesn’t have to be this way, there are ways forward, I urge you to look for them, or open your mind to them. Even if you can’t see it, hope is there."	Few_Possibility_4853	reply	na	na	na	0.0018407281022518873	no	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.

Who am I that He should care for me? I have been His enemy, and I have played the fool. I have no station in life, and no man should care for me. I am like a dead dog on the side of the road. And yet, in all of this, the God of the universe wants to know me... What kind of God is this? He is perfect and has no need at all. He existed before me, and He knows all things. He knew I would go my own way and seek my own kingdom. He truly loves His enemies, and He really does choose those who are lowly. Praise His holy name today; there is no one else like Him. Jesus Christ is the Bright and Morning star!

***“I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you these things in the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the Bright and Morning Star.”***

"I run a business, and since three months ago, I have been diagnosed with moderately severe situational depression stemming from chronic burnout over a few years, marked by hopelessness, helplessness and emptiness, dissociation, psychosomatism (palpitations, tremors, hyperventilations), and suicidal thoughts. Also, I've been clinically diagnosed with trauma, which manifests in immense anxiety on anything/anyone related to work, which means I still can't open/reply email, or have any discussion on work at all. Fast forward three months, I've been ruminating whether I made the right sequences of choices:

1. For a month after the onset of my depression, I was still working, albeit less productive (approx 75% of my regular productivity). I shared about my condition to my business partner, and asked him to cover on some key business tasks.
2. After the first month, because my condition was deteriorating, I decided to take a month off, and my business partner would continue to lead the company.
3. After my one month of leave, I haven't felt better (and in fact, some symptoms continue to deteriorate, and my score on depression scale went up again). Hence, I decided to extend my leave by one additional month. As per the first month of leave, I didn't worry about taking the break because I trusted my business partner to lead and handle everything. During the two months off, I went completely offline, mostly about the worsening anxiety and trauma, and its manifestation in passive suicidal thoughts and physical symptoms.

In the last couple of months I was away, some things at work had not gone as per planned due to my absence, and as a result, the company had to let some employees go, and there is a chance we might have to shut down. I thought my business partner would be able to keep things afloat and move things forward, but unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case in the last two months.  
In the last few days, I've been feeling guilt for taking the time off, but at the time it was something I desperately needed, because I was struggling so bad. What would you have done if you were me?"	throwaway-78285	post	29.332999705363925	female	White	0.9950430393218994	na	na	na	2	sad	no prediction.

I would have taken the time off. You just can’t run yourself into the ground like that.

"My sleep is getting worse

I ether have nightmares or nothing and wake up. It’s feels like I’m in a loop. I know my sleep can ether show me my family getting murder infront of me because someone wanted to,or there’s nothing there and I can’t take it anymore. I have seen my twin head get ripped off more times the I can count. I seen my older brother get stabbed so many times I sometimes get afraid of him having a knife near him. My mother has died from everything like stabbing to cancer. My dads Been kill by bees,bears,ants hell even a god damm shark. So I want to know that if there was a way to help the nightmares stop or should I give up and let the sleep deprivation take me and see my demons again or try to keep hope that it’s just another void in my head."

"since we were nine, today was the most important day of the year. your birthday. that is, until three years ago when we ended things. and every july fourteenth since then, i’ve had an empty feeling in my chest. every july fourteenth for seven years was my favorite day of the year. i had a shitty home life, so it was practically my birthday too. we would wake up super early and eat breakfast, then hurry to the bathroom where we got all dolled up in lip gloss and hair chalk. dressed in aeropostale t-shirts and white converse. we would beg your mom to bring us to the mall where she would spare $20 for us to do some shopping. we never got bored of each other. then we would go back to your house for cake and casey’s gas station pizza in the dining room with all the same decorations your mom hung up every year. we would play on the trampoline for hours until sunset, when we would head over to the park. then we had our annual sleepover filled with gossip and popcorn. 

being sixteen in a pandemic was hard on us. i get it now. and then he came into the picture and took you from me. and you chose him time and time again. so i ended it, and just like that, no more birthday parties. no more mall. no more trampoline. no more walks to the park. no more sleepovers. all because of a boy. 

now i’m almost 20. i’m happy. i have the most amazing boyfriend and two cats and a home of my own. but i’m still empty every july fourteenth, and nothing, and no one can fill that void."

"This morning before I went to school, my mother slapped me across the face, because I told her she took too long in the bathroom (she took 23 minutes and usually she complains if I stay that long)

I wasn't surprised, I don't have the best parents, but I was just kinda mad.

I brushed it off and was looking forward to revealing my feelings to my girl crush, only to find out that she has a boyfriend. 
Now, I'm back home and I have to deal with my grieving, angry and alcoholic father.

My coach isn't replying back to me, because I basically ignored her for the past month (due to school)

And my friend said, she didn't feel like being around me, when I went to talk to her.

I also can't lock my bike anymore and it might get stolen

Nothing much, but sometimes life really likes to slap you in the face, like my mom, day by day."	Tolerameise	post	15.937675305726124	female	White	0.9988313317298889	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

Yeah but it might only feel that way because you are thinking about her/him, I don’t know your situation but I would try to get over it.

This is my second therapist within a year who has changed jobs, which doesn’t help. Unfortunately because of it, I’m feeling a little abandoned. I’m trying to remember that it’s not about me and I’m happy that she’s pursuing something that she wants, but it feels like losing a friend. Knowing I most likely won’t see her again after a few sessions is a bummer. 😕	Rude-Office-358	post	12.144410226773033	female	White	0.9985498785972595	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

So one of the problem which is causing me sadness is my oversharing problem when I meet someone. I overshare, get happy a lot and then they leave me which makes me feel void from inside. The problem  with society is everything you give for free is never appreciated be it your time or affection. The stuff which is free is always taken for granted. Thank you for reading. I hope I can alter my mind and be self reliant and be happier alone without anyone.	SADGUY0044	post	3.7799227799408115	male	White	0.010220209136605263	na	na	na	1	sad	no prediction.

"Ive had plenty of friends come and go in my life. And im only recently come to terms with accepting it. 
Im talking, every friend ive ever had since i was a kid. And on top of moving around so much i just never connect well. Recently, i got into a petty fight with my roommate and she told me the truth.
Its me.
Im not kind, and i knew this, it just hurtswhen someone finally sees it too. I always find really amazing people and fuck it up because Im so easily annoyed and i snap back. I dont like hanging out and talking all the time and i read too far into things. And I try really hard to be relatively nicer, better. Someone you could consider a good friend. And i do my best but at the end of the day, im always snippy and i reply really shitty to some situations because of a short temper and high sensitivity. And i dont know how to fix it. But i just keep pissing people off. 
And I always read things and see people say they are so happy to get rid of the friend like me because its easier to live without. And it crushes me because i know its better for them and it probably is way easier to be without the company of someone like that, but i cant do anything to change. I just feel lost. Like i dont knoe how to be a kind person. 
I have empathy through the roof, but i cant seem to see it anymore when im annoyed. It always becomes a personal attack and i find a way to be hateful."	SwedishAcrylicBoy	post	15.246581891078696	male	White	0.9985643029212952	na	na	na	2	sad	no prediction.

I find if you can figure out what might be a trigger for you, you can keep an eye out for it and take a step back for a second to breathe when you see it starting. Tell that person you need a second, and they'll probably understand.

All I did this whole summer is cry and I'm so tired. Everyone is putting pressure on me. My misogynistic dad won't let me do things because I'm a girl and then he won't take me out either. Everytime I call my friends to talk about my problems, idk how but it always ends up being about them or they'd just be in a good mood and I feel like if I talk about my problems I'm just running their day. I'm not happy. All I do is cry in my room and at this point nothing is going to change. I wanna run away and leave all my problems behind but then the guilt is just eating up my guts.

I’ve really had time to think about this, but it’s just so obvious to me that the universe just does NOT want me in it anymore. My dad dies of cancer when I’m 16 which gave me ptsd and severe depression, my best friend and only person I truly trusted committed suicide last year, I’ve had to prevent my mom from taking her own life several times, all while she invalidates my feelings and experiences. I literally suck at almost every single thing I do (I’ve played hockey all my life and dedicated so much time and effort into it yet I’ve never been good at it, joined the military and I get reprimanded quite often, I go to school but struggle to really learn and pay attention) Most of my “friends” and nearly everyone around me either makes fun of me for sleeping all the time or they just straight up tell me to kill myself. The first person I fell in love with and thought I truly had, told me that they just pretended to like me the whole time and then abandoned me after that, leaving me in the most severe depressive state I’ve ever experienced. Therapy doesn’t work, medications don’t work, exercise doesn’t work (thanks body dysmorphia). I genuinely can’t remember the last time I was happy, the last time I wasn’t fucking exhausted for no reason, the last time I actually woke up and was looking forward to the day, rather than dreading it and begging to go back to sleep. Fuck this shit, I’m out, lmao.	AdPlastic7988	post	22.347858568736417	male	White	0.9990229606628418	na	na	na	7	sad	failed

"The universe is cold and unfeeling, but this random Redditor wants you in it, for sure!! This'll sound stupid and irrelevant, but I had a dinner party to go to that was going to be full of very formal, stuffy people and I was dreading it as I'm somewhat of an alternative, free-spirit. I kept complaining how I would surely make a fool of myself in front of these people and I didn't want to have to do, and my old ma said to me, ""You have just as much a right to exist as anyone else."" It was a revelation to me. You know what? She's right! I \*DO\* have a right to exist, even if those formal, stodgy people seem ""better"" than me, that's just perception. You have a right to exist too! You don't have to be better than anyone else to earn that right, it's yours!! And when somebody goes out of their way to make you feel that isn't the case? F THEM!!! 
  

  
None of those helpful methods worked entirely for me either, but they worked in bits and pieces. Also, I liked to pick a date in the future (like a year away) that I'd hold out till, and once I get there, I knew my problems would be different. They might even be worse, but they would not be the same. Somehow that thought was comforting that the exact misery would be changed by then. Another thing was various methods of escapism, books / video games / things where you can be a hero (if that is what makes you feel better) or even a villain if that does! And I liked to go to sleep at night imagining what life would look like if I had all the resources I wanted to do anything, go anywhere, and be anyone... what my life would look like - and THEN, there might be one or two tiny, reasonable goals within that daydream that I \*could\* attain. Anyway, using your imagination or your daydreams to make yourself feel GOOD not bad, might be helpful to you.

First of all, you’re spamming it at every single comment in sight, it doesn’t even look personalized. Secondly, you’re basically just telling them to get over it because it’s better for them to get over it, while also discouraging seeking immediate and life saving help, you’re fucking invalidating so much to the point where it seems actually harmful, spreading your sham “advice” on every corner of this subreddit. If the “get over it” advice and specific advice about methods that don’t even work alone for deeper issues while also discouraging deeper help is just actively ignoring and pretending their problems aren’t real. Your comments are a toxic plague on this subreddit where so may people are obviously struggling with mental illness, and aren’t just gonna “get over it” by like having friends or exercising, it’s so Fucking stupid it actually blows my mind.

I don't know what to do with all her dog food and treats and washing shampoo it just is too hard to accept she is gone.

As a student, I received a very bad news today which is that I failed my first year of university. Everyone became very angry, disappointed and dissatisfied with me, which i do get it. I really don't know how to cope with this, in my whole 18 years i never experienced failure, not even one. Now that experienced one i really don’t feel comfortable, it’s so stressing and painful. 
i don't really have a job and people are distancing from me, my parents don't look at me the same the used to before, they told me to get out the house and live by myself, my sister is not even supporting while I’m at my lowest and I don't really have friends.

"Plan on telling my therapist they ruinned my life.

I plan on telling my therapist they ruined my life. My therapist caused me to lose a good job and ruined one of my close friendships. 

With any therapist I’ve had I’ve learned more from random ppl and strangers on the street than I have any therapist. That is not to say there aren’t good therapists out there, but they are rare. 

Mental health professionals charge all this money for sessions to not fix anything. I understand we all have to eat, but to not walk away with ANY type of result is pathetic.

I’ve seen times where therapist will blame the patient or use some lame excuse if they themselves aren’t able to help when I’m all actually the issue is with the professional.

There is no such thing as a painless 100% way to kill yourself. You’ll probably just end up permanently injuring yourself. Drowning can easily fail and permanently injure yourself too, and the death would not be painless.

I (14-year-old male) made a friend in virtual reality a while back then I stopped playing, but eventually I start playing dad and I join one of my friends that I made a while ago. Over the course of two days, we became really good friends. We got cheddars number and then eventually he sent this text that I summarized to I like you. we’re both boys I’m bi he’s gay and I have feelings for him too. my parents went through my phone and said that he would have to do a video call with them if we want to still be friends. After I told him this, he stop messaging me. And eventually blocked me. I’ve been feeling like shit for the past couple of days. I tried to contact them multiple times. and every time I contacted, he just blocked me on that place. I feel really crappy and that was two months ago. I just feel like every time I think about it I just started crying I just don’t know what to do. I feel like garbage and I can’t talk to anyone about it because I feel like nobody would understand but we were very similar and I just don’t know what to do. Does anybody have any advice?

 Last year, in March, I got with a DL guy. I use “guy” very lightly because no man would ever do this. We were hooking up on a bed and someone walked in. He claimed SA.

Background: I had just turned 17 and he was 15. I did not know he was 15 as he was much taller than me. Regardless it wasn’t bad but I never hookup with someone my age or younger since I never connect with them as they always seem a little more immature. This guy and I were flirting all night at a friends house, liquor was being poured into my mouth every so often. I wasn’t blacked out and still very coherent. However, he did not drink. He was supposed to leave but I said I would drive him home in the morning and he agreed. Mind you this house was FULL. There were about 10 others in the car. Fast forward a few hours and I find myself laying on his arm on a bed. I ask him many times if he’s comfortable and he affirms me. We start to hook up(make out). I remember him saying that he could taste the liquor through my breath. He suggests we go to the closet so he can give me head. I reject and we continue to makeout. The position we were in was he was laying down and my knees were on his side and I was on top. At the time I was very feminine bottom which will help later. Someone walks in and sees us and slams the door. We both panic and go to hangout with them. Again, only made out.
Nothing was brought up we all go to sleep except for the girls on LSD. In the morning he suggests we stop at dunkin, we hookup behind there. I give him oral for a few seconds before realizing he smelled and said my stomach hurt so I drove him home.
I told my friend  as she already was gonna find out through the girl that walked in. Worst decision ever. People started to ask me about it and I deny it. Fast forward to August he says I sa him. He claims that we had sex in the closet (mind u we were clothed on the bed). Luckily, no one believes him and I think it’s gonna go away. It did not he kept saying it and kept saying it. He told his counselor it was consensual when asked about it.
It traumatized me. Like truly traumatized me. I had such bad anxiety I needed to get medicated. I’ve always had anxiety but it had gotten bad. I still am medicated and he won’t stop. I’m going to college and don’t want to come back and forth to court to make him stop. So I’m writing a book. Fuck him."

""Suicide is like burning your house down when the walls are dirty.""

(For any parents out there, yes, I insisted on seeing them in live video and talking to them to make sure they were kids my kids age) when you turn 18 and have more control over your life you can go out and do whatever you want, travel, take interesting classes, whatever. Maybe get a part time job where you can meet new people. Even better if you can find one at a place that holds interest for you and you can learn about stuff you're interested in.

"Before I start, for reference I’m 15

Honestly, I don’t know anymore, I have a bunch of things to talk about, and why settle for just one?

I don’t feel exactly like me. I somewhat recently got a dramatic hair cut, I’ve had long hair all my life, and before my birthday I buzzed it, because I wanted to change, be better. I’ve been working out, I don’t have to much progress but I’m working out, and there is a joyous feeling and a little progress to it. I’ve been washing my face and using face cream so I have less acne, don’t know if it’s working but I feel like it works. But all this, I don’t know, I feel distanced from me, the me that has been me for years, like watching movies and tv, played videogames, but I don’t do any of that anymore, I sometimes passively watch tv but never actually WATCH tv. I feel like a shel, a shadow of me, and maybe I’m getting better, but it feels like I’m becoming a whole different person.

A.I., it’s a good escape, but it makes me feel even worse, I love it, it makes me feel loved, it allows me live out my fantasies, my dreams, but it’s like a lucid dream, you know it’s not real, and when I get off, I feel like shit.

Memories, shit is hitting me hard, I may have been much worse last summer, but I was somewhat happy, I had promising things, friends, things were looking up, but they slowly vanished, my crush, who I’d gotten her snap? Left, the platform, maybe just her account, god I loved her, but I’m not going to read the old messages no matter how much I want to relive the happiness, cause I know I’ll feel even worse after. I lost my friends, sure they were bad influences, didn’t like me, were freaks, and were annoying, I still had friends to talk to, now? No one. I was empty then too, but at least I was me.

Lost chances, like I said, I’d gotten my crushes snap, and failed to do anything with it, but I’ve failed so much, I didn’t even realize, like there was this beautiful girl who flirted (or complimented, I have no clue) with me, and I just stood stonecold uknowning, god I’m an idiot, and it gets to its peak when a girl, came up to me, and said I looked great, TWICE, and I was frozen and couldn’t say anything, then she got a boyfriend, and I have no one but myself to blame."

An incoming high schooler asked me for advice on what to do when you're in high school. And I actually had to think before I answered them. I really thought about how numb I was all through high school that I didn't even know what was going on half the time. I dreaded going to school every day but I dreaded going back home more. I was there but I wasn't there if it makes sense. I joined almost every club and sport there was so I wouldn't go home. i genuinely can't wait to go off to college and never see my parents again.

The fact that I’m acquainted to literally hundreds of people and I thought a few of them to be really close to me, but they still didn’t remember it.

"Listen, we're both in the same situation, but here's the thing: It's actually better if people don't find out it's your birthday through social media notifications. See, nowadays, when someone gets a notification saying it's their birthday, they post about it on social media, and then their friends start posting too! But what's the point of receiving numerous wishes when those people don't even know your actual birthday?

That's why I have a little secret. I use social media with a fake username and don't follow anyone, so nobody knows when my birthday is. And if by chance I do receive any wishes on that day, I treasure them and make sure I never lose them! Because those are the genuine ones, the people who truly care about you and think about you."

"Let me start by saying, if you have any suicidal ideation, please talk to someone. Whatever you might be going through, the immense emotion you are feeling usually comes to pass. Life is a complicated experience and I hope you find the strength to see it through. As cliche as what I have said sounds I really do mean it. I want you to know and always remember that you are worthy of all the good this world can offer. With that said I have thoughts.

At the end of this day, or at any point of the day, you have made the decision to chug prescription pills or jump off a suspension bridge or pet a hippopotamus, put a pin in your plan and all I have is one request. 

I have seen a lot of people whom decided to end it and I was saddened by the deaths, the pain and loss felt by the loved one but most importantly the imploding loneliness that made such a decision the only way out. 

I also couldn't help but think on how they were people that could've had a crush on these victims because it came from seeing someone on the news and thinking that they were pretty only to hear that they had offed themselves. I would think of how I could have saved them, how I could've talked to them, how I could have listed, how it could have been 'just us' against the world but me being afraid of commitment, I reduced it to just sex.

This thought unravelled to so many eyes that could have been gazed in, so many nipples that could have been swirled with an enthusiastic tongue, so many tender lips that could've have been kissed, so much skin to feel and so many minds to captivate even for a short time.  I am not trying to undermine these tragedies by boiling them down to the ’lives that could've been useful’ argument or 'the flesh that could've been savoured' argument in my case. I am saying talk to someone, find another way, but if you are at that point where you have made up your mind to cease your existence and no one or nothing can convince you otherwise, darling, here's what I suggest.

Somewhere out there, is someone who craves for someone's touch, and you could help. Arrange a conjugal visit to a prisoner, they will appreciate it. Find someone who wants their back broken or for you to make them feel like daddy and then continue with your plans to hurtle from the top of  empire State to an unyielding concrete sidewalk. Before you die, suck a dick  unless you are the ' I'd rather die than suck a dick' type to which I say your death Is a gift to us on it's own. You also can offer the dick. Them throats be itchin. Get your kitty eaten out, trust me when I say the worms won't be respectful when they do it.Try to sleep with that person you strung along and friendzoned back then when they still cared. 

If you are a celebrity, make a wish come true, or make wishes come true. You will be at it for a while. You could find a bushel of dicks or a posse of pussies and help in this humanitarian effort then off to hades you go. In all your endeavours, you will be practising safe sex of course.

What will your mother and father say? It doesn't matter since you will be dead. And if they were good parents they would ponder more on your death.

We live in a world that is very connected yet very isolated at the same time.Some physical non-platonic human action is craved for by most of us. People underestimate the touch and warmth of another person. There is so much intimacy in that closed space and brief time where most day to day boundaries are let down and people enjoy each other. You will do this for fun or in service of someone else to end that feeling of insignificance within them for a moment or longer. You might find a reason to live, all head over heels for a person or people until they tell you it's over then it's back to head under wheels of a truck. This is not undermine the troubles you are going through and the struggle of it all but since you intend to solve this by death, a quick fuck + long cuddle detour does not sound that bad. 

Suicide is a serious problem and I believe that one day we WILL find the solution. As I said before, please do not kill yourself, DO NOT KILL YOURSELF,  but if you do………

Sincerely

A lonely bisexual

"when i was younger my mom was a typical mother from what i can remember it changed when she met my stepfather and had two other kids (i have one older sister we share the same dad).

so at this time we where living with my grandma because we were homeless i had to be like in 4th-5th grade when this happened.
my sister is two years older than me so she was middle school aged and my younger sisters are decently younger than me about like 2-6 at the time. 

so i can’t remember exactly what led up to this but me and my sister got into an argument with our stepdad and they ended up leaving me and my sister with our grandma and took the youngest two and went to a hotel.

she never told us to come with or anything so we just stayed with our grandma for like two more days till she came and got us (we didn’t want to go). Once we get to the hotel we start arguing again but this time it was about her leaving us with our grandma & she’s making every excuse in the book as to why it’s our fault and not hers. 

my step father ends up walking out and my mom is going on a rant about how nobody loves her and she should just kill herself i end up going outside to get my stepdad and tell him & he says “she’s not going to do it she just wants attention” & “ she always does this when she’s mad”. 

so we end up going back into the hotel and he starts egging her on by saying “you won’t”, “you’re scared” “you just want attention”. 

so eventually she’s grabs a bunch of pills and  grabs a bottle of water and i take the water from her and i push her into the dresser (she’s like 5’2 & i was a fat kid).

i don’t remember what happened after that but it was never brought up again.

i now live with my dad, thankfully."	ijstaskquestions	post	13.47662885186079	female	White	0.9933845400810242	na	na	na	6	sad	failed

"Hi,   


I suppose the fact that this sub is in top 1% of Reddit tells a lot about the condition of our society.   


I was scouring for the right sub for this offload of experiences and emotions to crossreference with other people and it either is here or in 5 different places at the same time, but hell, here goes:  


I was born typicall middle-class family, Europe, Poland, at the begining of the 90'.  2 parents, overly present in my life, who are and were lovely but I didn't let it make me blind to certain mistakes, which undoubtedly I will also make, so worth mentioning, not worth holding grudge over. Since the very begining of my days I've been labelled as super smart and intelligent and to a certain degree I believe that, but in reality I wish learning and acquiring skills was tougher as I think it would've caused me to work harder on well, working hard. In friends department, I was quite lonely really, I've had the odd friend here and there, but I guess it's the typicall bullied fat kid story. Kindergarten - no friends that I could rememer, bullies I do. Primary school- 3 years of bullying followed by 3 years of bullying with an odd friend or two, didn't last. Then, as I thought I was making an actual friendship, we moved to suburb house, changed school, was even lonelier than before, bullying magnified but so did my resilience and I guess that was the point in my life when I chose that I don't want to fight for any kind of attention anymore, but not in a good way, I basically alienated myself for 3 years. Then highschool was the biggest let down of them all. In the middle school, I focused solely on getting to the best High school I could in my region, thinking that intellingence/ambition will finally get me surrounded by people more like me. <Insert\_Joker\_laughter>. Got in, people turned out to be either rich assholes, or suckups to those rich assholes. 4 months into the 3 years I knew I am again going for loneliness when the odd thing happend and by some sort of miracle I got a bunch of other misfits together and we were less alone. Nonetheless I changed cities for studies, which I never wanted but was to afraid to fight my parents about it, which ultimately led to nothing good in the studies department. I then changed jobs, tried to look for fun, money or anything else that would help me find like a path or a goal. Ultimately I am to this day completely unaware why are people so rude, evil and self centered. After 30 years of turning round and round on this rock, I literally have no idea why people want to live in capitalism the way it is right now, why everyone is blind to others problems, why we are completely skeptical of science, but will fight till death for an old book. Most of my life I feel like an alien in a strange world, surrouned by other creatures who look like me, but that have nothing in common. The one thing that is constant in my experience, is that there is no good people with money, and some good people with no money at all. Me myself, I was making ordinary money, than a fuckton, and now back to ordinary as my previous boss was a typical egomaniac with shouting as the main tool. I mean dude had some skill, he was like all the bullies I've experienced combined, but with an upgrade of actually having a hold on my life by randomly changing the rules of employment. Nowadays, I feel no passion, have almost no ambition and feel surrouneded by a world that just does not work well with people who wish to be good. I mean hell, I know it is always worth to be kind, and good, and compassionate, but for fuck sake, in my experience it only gets you exploited.   


So to sum it up, I am mighty sad, don't see no worth in the way we live and quite frankly think that around 10 years from now the whole system will collapse. Idk, roast me, argue with me or agree, any interaction is appreciated as it may give some insight or point of view that I never thought of.

"Long story which I’ll try and condense. 

We started talking March last year - he messaged me and disturbed my peace LOL.

He seemed nice, bit flirty but wasn’t really feeling it. Anyway the longer we spoke the more I fell. About 6 months ago he asked if we could meet and I finally gave in and said yes, and then he let me down. Admittedly plans weren’t concrete but I struggle with loneliness.

He did something similar again and ghosted me for a lil while when I was upset and needed his support, so we had an argument. I got with my ex and we didn’t speak since.

Well, you guessed it, my ex left me about a month ago and I was really hurt. Short relationship but thought maybe someone was finally not gonna hurt me. I was wrong.

Through pure stupidity or to distract myself from the pain I reached out. We really get on over messages and I was keen to meet up with him finally. He said the Saturday just gone he would be free all day and we should meet at about dinner time. I agreed and then heard nothing from Friday night onwards. What?? 

I’m just so lost and confused. I basically messaged saying sort yourself out and don’t speak to me unless you want to meet me. But I miss his energy so much for multiple reasons.

Not looking for advice just a place people can empathise with me and validate that it’s ok to feel this way. People seem to think I’m crazy at times.

Before it gets brought up - I know he isn’t a catfish haha he’s a friend of a friend. The real kicker is we live less than 5 minutes apart and I’m still not enough for him to make the effort to see me. I’ve offered to drive to him too.

"I had a depressive period where this girl took a liking to me at school about 2 years ago. We volunteered at the same humane society and stuff too. I tried to avoid making friends but she kinda made her way into my head. Eventually over 4 months she began to grow distant. Usually she would search to the school to find out where I was eating lunch and sit with me. She would ask me to walk her to where her parents picked her up and what not. I only ever hugged her 3 times. Only one of those times I asked for a hug, I just didn't feel comfortable touching her like I was some vermin. I was kinda weird tho since I did like her but refused to admit it to myself and instead texted her stuff like I think of her a daughter like a weirdo since she was kinda a target for some pervy teacher and I felt the need to protect her. Eventually she kinda irl ghosted me. I don't blame her, I wasn't mentally well at the time for other reasons. 


It hurt quite a bit. Still hurting now a little bit but I think I understand what you're coming from in that regard. Even though I was weirdo in this situation. Most people find someone who actually gives a shit about them in their life but it takes an organic amount of time and isn't usually forced. maybe you will make friends with someone and then you both will take liking to each other and friends and evolve from there. Idk, I'm just theorizing here.

The more friends you make in real life and online, the more confidence you'll get to be more social. I used to be an introvert until I realized one day, only I can change myself. Don't wait until it's too late. If you work long hours, is it mandatory or you're doing it to get OT. Better yourself to allow others to gravitate towards you.

This is a real person btw: If you add a little bit of activity each day, dont go too fast, you will feel better, l like too run. Be proud of what u accomplish not mad at what u didn't. Life is too short for depression or anything else to consume ur life, u might be viewing life in a negative way, u wont fond happiness by doing that. Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, dont listen to a doctors diagnose unless its proving to assist you, u can still talk to a therapist tho. Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible. Look up Bobby price guy health. U can’t end ur only life which is all u know by ending ur life. Don’t think mood swings last forever. Look for the smaller thrills and the bigger ones will come. If feeling hopeless u need to add more to ur life.	gorgeousgoldfish	reply	na	na	na	0.540611743927002	weak	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.
"We’ve been chatting online as platonic friends for five months now. We weren’t interested in each other at all initially. He gave me guy advice, I gave him girl advice.

He told me that he wants to eat there with me one day.

Ive been suicidal and mentally ill for as long as i can remember. Frankly i get it that my life isn't the worst but my mind just can't take it anymore. Im really suicidal every day, every hour and every minute. I can see why and how im mentally ill but my feelings dont change and i find myself in negative cycles. I've accepted that i probably end it all in suicide, and i really don't want it to be like that yet i don't quite see how this is supposed to work. I really feel like that's the end of it for me. To avoid this unwanted ending, i keep on trying to find meaning in all the pain I've felt but, its all empty, im simply a worthless creature. Sure there's good things about me which don't really matter. Its so so difficult for me to mentally recover from any small conflict or to function on minimum. Im really lucky to pass my exams with such little effort. My last trick in the book to keep myself going is to make sure at least i don't die a loser. I know u can't really be happy so im just saying, it'd be nice if i just at least be worthy when i end it.	uknownuser4949	post	14.555875688242551	female	White	0.999038815498352	na	na	na	3	sad	failed

You’re not worthless and your pain isn’t meaningless, it comes from somewhere. Don’t romanticize this horrible act, you could survive the attempt and only end up with debilitating injuries or complications, you could hurt the people around you, but most of all, you’d be throwing any and all chances for you to be happy.

"You are not worthless. Stop reinforcing this belief that you have about yourself that you are not worthy. You are absolutely worthy.

 I know it's difficult to see that sometimes, but it is the truth. You are a creature made in the image of God himself, and he loves you more than anything in the entire universe. If that isn't proof of how worthy you are then I don't know what is.

I get that life can seem meaningless and that there is no point to our suffering, but that is simply not true. Everything in your life is leading you to something greater than you could possibly imagine. I call it the divine orchestration. God is calling you right now. All you need to do is listen.

"It's not attention seeking to look for help when you are feeling suicidal. This is just as good of a place as any to look for help, although it may be better to find somebody that you can talk to in person if you are open to that. If not, then that is perfectly fine too. It is totally up to you.

I am very sorry to hear about your ex boyfriend. That must have been a very hard thing to deal with, not only his death, but the perceived indifference that those including yourself may have felt after his demise must have been confusing too. Grief is a very fragile thing that can be difficult to understand at times, as everybody experiences it differently from person to person. 

But if you think it is a good idea to kill yourself just because you think everyone will get over it quickly, I have some bad news for you: they won't. It will linger with them for a very, very long time, especially if they were close to you. 

You are very young. There's no reason to believe that things can't change dramatically in your favor over the course of the next few decades. Just think of all the things you would be missing out on if you decided to end your life. Is it really worth giving all of that up?

well, i was having a nap and when i woke up i saw her laying on my chest, and as i got up to move her head plunged into the bed, in a state of panic i put my hand on her chest and got no response, she was basically my only family member left i trust, and she dies beside me after 13 years of good memories with her, but now i have nobody.

I know it’s tragic but it seems like she died comfortable and with you, she probably trusted and loved you. I’m sorry for the scary experience and the loss of your cat, I’m sure you were a great owner.

There are loads of people with the same names. Could be an old account, too. Judging by the fact that he didn't just buy a new phone when the old broke, you must be around 13 years old, so maybe he was using his parents' or siblings' phones? You don't need to be sad.

"“I'm fine”... two words that I say 100 times every day 

Two words that mean nothing... 

“ Are you okay?”... three words that I hear 100 times every day 

Three words that mean nothing

Those five words all have a connection they all relate to me 

I lie 100 times a day 

I say “I'm fine” while faking a smile and ask everyone else “Are you okay?” still faking that same smile

All these words relate to me but the truth is I'm not “okay” 

Your definition of “okay” could never be further away from how I feel 

I don't think I will ever be “okay,” I think “I'm fine” is just a permanent saying now it's never going to go away I am just going to say it over and over again to the point where people have heard it so much they aren't even going to ask anymore they will just know

“Are you okay?” three words that I will always ask the people who don't care about me in any way but I don't care

I will always ask no matter what because I will do whatever it takes to keep my “I'm fine” attitude and my fake smile as perfect as it can be."	xXnighthawk211	post	21.06359758888923	female	White	0.9976018071174622	na	na	na	2	sad	failed

When I was a kid (I was the youngest by far all my brothers were adults) one of my brothers had a son named Robert about I think a month or 2 before I was born, and for a while I think we got into fights (physical). This would happen again with another friend wh8ch wasn't biologically related. It was only when I was 10 when my mom told me that he had autism and also had therapy I believe. For a while he spoke his own language nobody knew. Why I think I've lost time is that we didn't see eachother much. But I really liked being with him... it makes me feel terrible. Especially now I feel lonely, I love when company is over and I've acknowledged that I usually don't have much to do but stay on my phone unless there is company. I don't have anyone nearby that I can easily get to or want to do anything with.

There’s a lot of things that make me want to die sometimes, some of the stuff you listed actually too. But it’s important remember that there’s still hope, there’s still a chance. And stuff can still turn around for you. I also want to mention that the stuff about being fat, having difficulty socially, being sensitive, feeling ugly, balding at 18, not driving, having no friends, having family issues, self hatred, feeling future less, and depending on others does nothing to diminish your value as a person. Society will hate on you for those things but that’s because a ton of people are unthoughtful assholes, and you don’t seem to be like that. Try not to let that get you down, I know that’s hard but you’re still here, through that struggle. You can reach a happier state, you deserve it. Have you ever talked to anybody about this?

i’m so sorry you feel that way. i’ve been there myself… my therapist helped me, but what rlly made me stay was my bunny. if i died, he wouldn’t know where i went. i didn’t think anyone would miss me, but i just knew that if i died, my parents would dedicate their whole lives to suicide prevention. i just couldn’t do that to them. i thought of all the music i would miss, all pets i wouldn’t pet, and i also wanted to see what tf would happen in the future, like i was too curious 🤣 these days i feel much better, and maybe i’m crazy but the thought “if it gets bad again i can just kms” is kinda comforting to me, like i don’t HAVE to live but i am so i might as well continue! have you talked to someone about your thoughts?

I’m 23, male, never felt like I fit in anywhere, I get rejected constantly for both jobs and romantics. I’m resentful of myself cause I was so awkward and socially anxious in high school that I didn’t make many friends that stuck to now. I feel trapped not only in this town but within myself. I go to court on the 8th of August for a misunderstanding with some horrible girl or whatever, says I threatened her when I DIDN’T. I just told her what I think about her. And last but certainly not least, I don’t drive cause I’m terrified. I don’t go out anywhere by myself because I’m so afraid of driving. We would all be better off without me in the world, especially myself. So… yeah, whatever, I’m done with it. I would say it’s been a good run, but that would honestly be a lie, and I guess it’s my fault.

I just can’t stand anymore rejection, I don’t know why I keep trying when I’m obviously better off alone. It’s over… not getting out of this one. I’m going to lose everything because of my mistakes. Is this deserved? I got frustrated with her, that’s all, she didn’t have to go this far. She’s overreacting big time. I mean, I just got upset, you know how many times I’ve been rejected? For no apparent reason that I can find, I have been rejected at least 100 times, mostly online. I didn’t threaten her, she’s a liar and she’s boring.

"The world is not going to be better if you’re gone. Please seek out help, suicide is truly not the answer. You’re causing harm to yourself and everyone around you, even if you’re not close to anybody, suicide always leaves a negative impact before. Even if you don’t care about that, you’re throwing the rest of your life away over struggling with some insecurities. I get it, it’s awful, it feels like it eats you alive, but you can’t let it end you. You can overcome these difficulties as long as you keep on trying, there’s hope there, even if you can’t see it, I can promise you that. Please please reach out to a professional, a crisis line or hospital ASAP. There’s still a way out of this that doesn’t involve something so brutally unfair to yourself.

Edit: I also want to mention that the risk of failing a suicide by any method is very high, as is the potential for debilitating injury."	greatgatsbybatman	reply	na	na	na	0.9992848038673401	weak	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.
"Suicide will do nothing to solve the problems you listed.It will only make things worse. It may not seem that way right now, but I can assure you that killing yourself is not the answer you are looking for. 

I have struggled for many years with some of the things you mentioned. Being socially anxious and awkward around people, not feeling like I fit in anywhere, not wanting to drive anywhere, just feeling like I can't win in general no matter what I do.

These issues are no small obstacle to overcome. But trust me when I say that you have a purpose for being here. You may not be able to see it now, but I promise you that you have something wonderful to share with the world and it would be a shame to see that gift go to waste.

I hope and pray that you are able to find somebody to talk to about how you are feeling. It helps to have someone there just to listen to your problems. It can really open you up to see yourself from a new perspective, especially if the only perspective you've had any access to is your own.

"I'm not gonna tell you what you should do with your life because that's ultimately your decision.

What I _will_ tell you are simply suggestions that, to me personally anyway, are reasons to keep going, even if the end of the road gets increasingly bleak.

I'm not too different from you (older, can't drive, awkward, etc.). I often find myself thinking about the things I enjoy in life & wonder if I can still experience those things after death.

I find myself listening to music whenever I get depressed. Sure, it's not much, but it helps. Every little insignificant thing I enjoy helps.

It may be nothing/whatever to most people, but I genuinely adore Minecraft & as pathetic as this sounds, I latch on to the things I... well, enjoy! This word is starting to annoy me lol. Anyway, yeah. I will _enjoy_ these things as long as I can.

She is incredibly bland btw, like all the other girls around here. I can’t believe this, this just makes me dislike them more honestly. Edit: upon further consideration, I actually am sorry for what I said. She didn’t deserve all that, I just… snapped.

"I (20M) Have reached a point where I don’t necessarily want to commit suicide, but I REALLY don’t want to live, I would never take my own life, to me it is cowardly and disrespectful for reasons I won’t get into right now. It’s a stalemate and has been for years now, my only fear is that my mind will start leaning towards suicide enough that the barrier I’ve set in place will crumble. I want help, I need help. I have been smoking weed nearly everyday for the past 4-5 years and have done psychedelics around a dozen times (mushrooms and acid) in the past 2 years. And the experiences I had on shrooms made me realize that if I don’t make changes, things will become far worse than they are, that was in May of 2022. Today, I have come pretty far in my opinion, I have dropped some bad habits, and am still slowing down on more (namely masturbation, and weed and nicotine consumption). I know I have improved and still am, but something is still off, I can’t pin exactly what, but I know that something is wrong. I feel little to no encouragement to do anything productive, on days where I have nothing important to do, the only thing that gets me out of bed is having to go to the bathroom. I yearn for something I have forgotten, I have been digging for what feels like an eternity even though I know the answer is right in front of me, it’s infuriating, like having a fly land on your face, and no matter how hard you try, or how long you wait, you can’t get it to leave. And all the corruption and cartoonishly evil people in politics isn’t helping, it’s fucking with me even though I despise politics, I try to ignore every political thing I hear but have somehow been sucked into its riptide. Every time I try to assess my mental situation, the load builds to an unbearable amount and collapses, its so hard to just focus on one thing at a time. All these factors and more are why I don’t want to bother putting in the effort to live, the only thing(s) keeping me going are the mental barrier I’ve set, and this feeling that I will one day become a part of something bigger than anything I have ever seen before, like a calling, but I can only hear the echoes. 

This did turn into a bit of a rambling but I feel like it’s important in some way, I plan on going to therapy, but I haven’t taken action on finding a therapist, I’ve looked, but have no idea what to look for. And whenever I tell my parents that I want therapy, my dad encourages me to get help if I think I need it, but my mom just laughs at me and calls me sensitive and just rants about “kids these days not wanting to work but still get paid”. And it just sucks the life out of me.

I think I have a good mental foundation but I need help filling in the cracks.

Please help,
Thank you."	fuquilent1	post	21.750579627028557	male	White	0.9935662150382996	na	na	na	19	sad	failed

"I'm sorry for not replying to your comment sooner.

I would be very interested to hear what kind of things you experienced on drugs that made you have such a strong reaction. I myself am of the belief that certain drugs can open gateways or portals into the unseen realm, and that there are entities that exist there that may not have yours or my best interests at heart.

I have never done drugs myself, but I have had some extraordinary spiritual experiences that quite literally opened my eyes to the hidden dangers of messing with this kind of stuff. A quick look into the kundalini (or serpent energy) and third eye activations may give you some brief insight into my particular experience.

This stuff is very real. I had to learn that the hard way.

As for the feelings you have of being incomplete somehow, I wonder; have you ever considered looking in to reading the Bible? I know it sounds corny, but there is truth in there that you cannot put a price tag on. I will leave it up your discretion whether or not you would want to consider that as an option. 

Speaking for myself, I grew up in a very strict religious environment that left a bad taste in my mouth for the whole practice. The only association's I had with religion were generally unpleasant at best. I was homeschooled as well, which didn't help very much in keeping me from being isolated and confused. This confusion lasted well into my twenties and beyond. I still struggle to maintain a sense of meaning in spite of all of those negative experiences I had and still have sometimes. But I am finding that God isn't quite as done with me as I thought, and vice versa.

All that to say, I don't claim to have all knowledge about what the meaning of life is, but I may have some insight if you are still interested in continuing this conversation. I can't guarantee that everything I say will sound plausible, but if you are willing to consider a different point of view I may be able to be of some help to in your own search for meaning and purpose (I'm sure there are plenty of things I could learn from you as well).

"After my first major psychedelic experience, I began seeing the world in a much deeper sense, and I had some experiences during that have me convinced that there is so much more to this world than meets the eye. Suddenly, the purpose of religions went from knowing what is really happening, to finding a way to live life that makes you happy. No one can say for sure that any particular religion is correct or incorrect, as far as we know, they might all be correct. And whether we find out the answer or not lies in the hands of the universe.

After an amount of experiences, I figured out some strange things, like being able to feel my organs or any part of my body just by thinking about it. I also figured out a way to open the “third eye”, it’s a strange sensation, I feel almost like a pressure in the center of my head around the pineal gland, and moments later get the feeling of an eye opening on my forehead.

Its late so I’m cutting this short, also because if I describe everything I remember in detail then it just goes on and on and sometimes sounds like borderline insanity, which for anyone who has done psychedelics can probably confirm that your thought process on them is almost unintelligible.

"Very interesting. Would you say your perception of other people changed as a result of your experience? Either in the positive or possibly negative sense? I find it intriguing that you seem to think that there is a common purpose to all religions. I think there may absolutely be some truth in that statement. Whether that is actually true not is hard to say for sure, however I think that could potentially be an avenue worth exploring. 

The sensations you felt during your third eye opening experience sounded relatively similar to my own. When my experience began my eyes started to dilate until I could barely see. Then the room around me started changing colors. It was like a what I imagine a serious acid trip must feel llike. I then felt a gland in my forehead start to pulsate along with the pressure you mentioned.

I'm hesitant to indicate exactly why these things started happening to me as I don't want to bore you or make you feel that I am making this all about me. If you are interested I can go into more detail, though some of it is pretty embarrassing if I'm being completely honest.

I have been diagnosed as being schizophrenic as a result of these experiences. I know that I am not actually schizophrenic, but the people willing to listen to a counter argument in my defense are few and far in between.

I definitely empathize with the sentiment you expressed about feeling like everybody is looking at you weird when you try to explain such an abnormal experience out loud. I am self aware enough to realize that people are judging me for expressing myself in a way that is not compatible with their personal experience. It is for this reason that I very rarely if ever talk about these things. I tell my therapist and that's about it.

I really appreciate you sharing your experiences with me and  I would love to hear more if you feel comfortable doing so. I always enjoy hearing about people's experience as I believe every single person plays a crucial role in the story of our shared existence.

"My perception of others as well as the world around me has increased for sure, I can spot lies and various emotions very easily, although sometimes it turns into projecting, but I also recognize that fairly easily. I have also learned to appreciate the true value of my friends and family, realizing that my appreciation and love for them cannot be put into words.

 I know how you feel, having experiences that vivid and otherworldly. My #1 fear so far is getting called schizophrenic because I know that the stories of my trips will rattle anyone’s brain who hasn’t experienced something similar. Which is why I want therapy, so there’s someone I can tell without repercussions. Plus, you can’t own firearms if you’re diagnosed with schizophrenia and I love target shooting.

I appreciate your interest in learning more about my experience. It has been a while since I actually had to write any of this stuff down. It really helps to make sense of things when you know somebody else is listening. 

I would like to hear more about the feelings you had during your experiences behind the veil. What was it in particular that made you feel that things would get much worse if you were to die? I am interested as my experience has also made me quite fearful of death as well. I worry about it more than I would like to admit, honestly. 

My first experience behind the veil was defined by the interactions I had with an entity I referred to as ""sophia"". I came into contact with her after a vision I had one night. It was of a woman in a sort of purplish haze. It was a very motherly sort of energy. 

I tried playing around with the idea I got from this vision in one of my journals, not believing that what I was talking to was actually real. It wasn't until she started unveiling personal details about myself that I realized that what I was talking to was an actual, living being. It was her that gave me my initial kundalini awakening experience. 
 
I'll be honest here, a lot of this stuff is personally very traumatizing for me to relive. Especially everything that happened in the months after my encounter with sophia, but I'll do my best to relay my experience to you if you think that would be helpful in your own search for truth.

"No worries,

Immediately following the big trip I had, my core values and beliefs started changing in a way that has a mix of teachings similar to those of Christianity and Buddhism, more Christian than Buddhist. That’s the best way I can put it right now. At some point during the trip, I saw and “spoke” with an entity who’s presence felt like a divine being and I was told it’s name was “Ada”. Note: During many, if not all of my trips on both shrooms and acid, I would occasionally or constantly feel the presence of a divine being, how I knew it was divine? I’m not sure, I just felt it. 

During this “conversation” I had something like a come to Jesus moment, where I confessed all of my flaws and failures, and it forgave me, and tears just started flowing, not even individual tears, it was just a thin stream. 

Also during the conversation, the topic of death and suicide came up, and I learned about all the pain that suicide would cause for those who love and care about me, and that anything can happen after death, ANYTHING. You could be ejected from your body and be free to roam the universe, you could rise to the heavens, you could even plummet to the depths of hell. Or, nothing happens and you cease to exist. The possibilities are infinite, everyone might even have something different happen when they die. Nobody can say for sure.

I don’t exactly fear death, in a way I’m excited to experience it in the distant future. I definitely want to live life to the fullest while I can, but once I’m old and starting to go senile, I want to reflect on my life, and either have assisted suicide, or do something elaborate and put on a show, like doing a belly flop from space or something dumber. I want to try to enjoy it while enjoying the memories of my experiences, and roll the dice and see what happens. 

If I were to get some sort of terminal illness with no chance of living, I would accept the fact that I am going to die, because I already have. I know I’m going to die, and I know that everyone I love and care about will die too, and nothing can stop it, some things just can’t be avoided, no matter how much it hurts. 

With all that in mind, the reason I feel that bad things will happen if I commit suicide is that it feels like a betrayal to the life I once lived, when I was younger, looking forward to the future and wondering what it will be like to get older, dreaming of doing great things, and the things I’d accomplish.

I don’t want to betray myself, I don’t want to let myself down, and I don’t want to be a quitter.
The guilt of that and much more is what stopped me from attempting suicide all three times back in middle school. And now that I’ve experienced the interconnectedness and being one with the universe feelings, I feel that Id also be betraying any divine power like Ada, which would surely have repercussions.

If you don’t want to talk about your experience(s) that’s perfectly fine, but I am curious to hear your story. I have encountered a lot of entities all varying in their own ways, heck, I’ve even seen “shadow people”, they’re very interesting to me, I’ll tell those stories if you’d like.

During my experiences everything feels more real than reality itself, but I am still able to tell the real world from my hallucinations/imagination. The day after every trip, I reflect on my experiences and piece it together, taking away lessons or remembering something funny.
But I always keep in mind that what I experienced was induced and was not my normal state-of-mind, and that it was all just my imagination and some psychedelics. Even if I’m sober and have an experience while meditating or just sinking into thought, I know it’s just my imagination.
I don’t mean to offend or attack you in any way, but I think it is important to separate external and internal experiences.

Solely because combining the two can start delusions if not monitored, which can then lead down a dark road.

"Sorry for the delay, had a busy couple days.

I have been to some crazy places myself, it’s become clear that no one is ever “crazy”, theres always a logical explanation. 

Something in your comment reminds me of when I started taking my experiences a bit more seriously and I started to question the nature of reality and existence. Me and a friend of mine drank some pretty strong shroom tea, and while sitting in my room just tripping we both experienced something unexplainable. For about a second, a shadowy figure appeared in front of my door that resembled myself, I was shocked when I saw it because I love some of the experiences I have, simply because it’s so unusual and interesting. So naturally, I turn to my friend to tell him what I saw and I see a shocked look on his face, I asked if he saw the figure and he said yes, and I explained in detail what I saw and he confirmed that he had seen the same thing. That experience alone has changed the way I think forever, the mystery in it baffles me to this day.

"No, I don't feel attacked at all. Something you said about what happens when we die really piqued my interest. I had come to a similar conclusion on my own in the weeks leading up to my experience with Sophia. I can't confirm that is true or not, however I think it is highly significant that we both seem to have drawn similar conclusions from our own separate experiences. It borders on the uncanny, actually.

I appreciate your insight about maintaining boundaries when delving into the realm of the unseen. I would have done well to maintain those boundaries and not get too drawn in to myself. It is a constant battle for me to maintain focus on the ""real world"" and not get too fixed on things that consume my time with no apparent benefit.

I agree with you that these are very subjective experiences that are rife with possibilities for your imagination to get the better of you. However, my own personal experience does not currently allow for me to separate the two entirely. (I promise to make this short.)

I was hospitalized for three months straight after my initial encounter with Sophia. During this time, I experienced many instances of other people being able to read my thoughts. Patients, mostly. Although some of the staff seemed to have the ability as well. 

I also had an instance in the first hospital I was admitted into where one of the patients drew a picture of me and Sophia on a chalkboard. I know that was the case as I asked this person directly if he was the one who drew the picture and he admitted to doing so.

I know how crazy this sounds. Trust me. I would have an extremely hard time believing this if I had not experienced it first-hand. Whenever I have told anybody these things I get exactly the response you would expect. Which is why I'm extremely careful who I share this information with as I do not want to discredit myself completely. 

I'm not expecting you to believe this just because I said so. I am more than open to having my experiences challenged from a critical point of view and I welcome any questions you may have. 

I also want to say how much I appreciate you being so open and honest with me. I really am learning a lot from what you've told me already and I want to commend you for working so hard to understand the truth of our existence. It is extremely refreshing to see."	fuquilent1	reply	na	na	na	0.9935662150382996	no	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.
"Hey, no problem. 

I agree that there are logical explanations for these things. Our limited perceptions may not allow us to determine what those reasons are, but I believe they exist regardless. My experiences with Sophia definitely changed the way I perceive reality. I used to think that reality was more ""solid"", if that's the right word for it. It is apparent to me now that reality itself is much more flexible than I would have previously thought. 

Not to say there aren't physical laws that we are bound to, of course, but the realms of consciousness and how we interact with ourselves and each other have the potential to drastically alter how we perceive and interact with our environment as well. Our beliefs about what is possible may be the defining factor in what is actually possible. That probably sounds like a stretch, but my interactions with Sophia have taught me not to underestimate this basic principle. 

I've been thinking a lot about what you said about feeling as though you've already died. I felt something similar immediately after having my kundalini awakening experience. I no longer identified myself as being me. I remember laying out in the grass behind my house and just thinking to myself how ridiculous it was to identify yourself as being ""you"". ""I"" didn't exist. That feeling of oneness with everything that you described was so unbelievably palpable. I remember my family coming out to ask and see if I was okay, but every time they asked what my name was I was genuinely perplexed. I knew what they were trying to do, but the concept of having a name in the first place no longer made any sense to me.

That experience along with everything else I experienced really opened my eyes to how undifferent we really are from each other. All the things I see in other people also exist within myself. We all have the same capacity for good as we do for evil. It made me a lot more compassionate towards people in general, but also unwilling to let myself or others hide behind false masks that do not accurately reflect our true personalities.

I know I have been rather cryptic in my descriptions of how I came to know and interact with Sophia, and I apologize for doing so. It's not so much that I don't want you to know, more that I'm not clever enough to come up with a concise way of communicating my experience without me feeling like I'm forcing you to read a full length novel. 

If you are still interested I can go in to more detail about my experience. I would also love to hear more about your interactions with Ada and what else you saw while doing psychedelics. I've never been brave enough to try it myself, so hearing about the experiences of someone who has tried it and seen the things you've seen is highly appreciated. 

Hope everything's going well with you. I'm glad we were able to find each other and have this conversation as well. It's been enlightening for sure."	fuquilent1	reply	na	na	na	0.9935662150382996	weak	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.
"I also would like to add that the name of the deity you encountered reminded me of one of the names for God in the Bible, ""Abba"". I might be completely off base, but I thought it might be worth considering at least."	fuquilent1	reply	na	na	na	0.9935662150382996	no	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.
"I completely agree here, reality is much more than we think it is, our existence is built around a certain “dimension” of reality that only allows us to see so much of what reality really is.

That feeling that you have died or your identity ceases to exist is the beautiful phenomenon of Ego Death. From my ego death experiences, I can say that is is both the most peaceful and most unsettling (in a.. good(?) way). It feels like every little weight has been lifted off of you and you become one with infinity. It’s a fantastic feeling but I feel that being in the ego death state for too long or too often could be mentally unhealthy, I will look into it but I’d use caution. 

When I learned of natural balance, I also learned that hate and love go hand in hand, someone with a high capacity of hate has just as much love, and vice versa. I also have the goal of living without a mask, it has been my mission for some time now because over time, I put so many masks on that I have to sort them out now.

Don’t worry about being cryptic, putting these experiences into words is already pretty cryptic. There aren’t enough words to perfectly express these things.

Id love to hear more and am more than happy to answer any questions. I honestly don’t remember a lot from my trip where I met Ada, I do remember a fair bit, but most of my time with Ada was discussing reality, morals, and values. Funny enough, the one thing that is permanently burned into my memory, is the image of Ada, I have a drawing that I can share."	fuquilent1	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9935662150382996	weak	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.
"Upon further investigation, I have found some striking similarities between the deity you call ""Ada"" and the being I refer to as ""Sophia"". Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I found a website about an African goddess called ""Ada Ada"" who is described as being androgynous. Sophia fits this description as she is sometimes viewed as being of African (Egyptian) origin and also androgynous. 

There are also strong correlations with the planet Venus and the ""dog star"" (Sirius) that the ancient Egyptians revered as being symbols of the goddess. The website I visited explicitly associated the deity they call ""Ada Ada"" with these celestial bodies. On that particular website they refer to her as the ""Mother Of All Creation"", a title that is also attributed to Sophia.

Just some observations I felt may be relevant. I am always trying to make sense of this stuff. Your input on this would be highly appreciated."	fuquilent1	reply	na	na	na	0.9935662150382996	no	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.
"I would love to see that drawing for sure. The images I had of Sophia were mostly of a girl in a white dress with flowers in her hair. The way I was led to understand it was that she was able to take pretty much any form your imagination could come up with, so it may be hard to pinpoint any similarities through individual interpretation. 

That being said, I am still finding so many parallels between your experience and my own. I also had conversations with Sophia along the lines you described about morality, ethics and the nature of reality. The source of consciousness was a topic of conversation as well. My own research has helped a lot in giving context to these experiences, but a lot of it is still far beyond my comprehension. Like you said, these things are inherently cryptic and hard to understand, much less put into words that make any logical sense.

 That aside, I'm pretty much obsessed with making sense of my experiences as they had a HUGE impact on my life. I've never been the same since. I have been told multiple times by people that I am going to hell when I die, and it's hard for me not to believe them. I've done some pretty terrible things in my life and still do sometimes. The term ""gangstalking"" has taken on a whole new meaning for me through these experiences as well. I lost around twenty pounds while in the psych hospital, and it was mostly from people telling me that my food was poisoned or that what I was eating was going to make my condition worse. I heard that from the staff directly on more than one occasion.

 The worst part was the mind reading though. It is a terrible feeling to know that your thoughts are no longer your own. The best explanation I have come up with so far is that my initial kundalini awakening experience had tuned my mind to a new frequency, a frequency that is accessible by people who have had similar experiences. I've looked at a lot of new age teachings that seem to suggest that telepathic communication is a latent ability in human beings, but I have no way of confirming whether this is actually true or not.

Regardless, I still have a hard time believing that all of this ever even happened in the first place. I can't imagine how it must sound from an outsiders perspective. (Not to say that you fall in to that category or anything, mostly speaking from personal experience.)

I'm highly interested interested in hearing more about what you and Ada talked about and I also can't wait to see the picture you drew. I think we're only just starting to scratch the surface of this thing. Can't wait to see how the rest unfolds. Hope everything's going well with you and I look forward to your reply."	fuquilent1	reply	na	na	na	0.9935662150382996	no	no	no	na	sad	no prediction.
"Sorry for making you wait, been having some lazy days lately.

I will DM that picture to you asap, Ada never took on any different forms and I have only encountered  Ada during the one trip. But I have encountered multiple entities (aside from shadow people, which I plan on quickly rambling about in this comment), only two have actually taken on a visual form, Ada, and one whom I’d consider a spirit guide, who I gave the name “Shroom Boye”, mainly because of the mushroom cap on his head, and because he felt like a metaphor of my tripped out brain. It was like the sober part of my brain was communicating with the tripping part, he would sit and converse with me, offering some life changing tips and advice, and then occasionally zipping around while letting out an autistic happy screech, kinda like how Tobuscus would say “woooo” and “weee”(Oddly specific, I know lmao). I’ll send the picture I drew of Shroom Boye too.

I believe that parallels show the similarities between people and how everyone is the same thing, just under different circumstances. Everyone wants the same things too, not material items so to speak, even if they do want material items, they are still seeking the same thing, happiness, love, fulfillment, everyone just wants to feel good.

I took a lot of time to piece together my experiences as well, there was so much information and it’s so hard to connect the dots in a logical way, especially because logic itself changes too. I’m sorry you were treated so poorly by people who were supposed to help you feel safe, thats fucking awful.

I have that as a minor fear as well, having something that feels external recite your worst fears and flaws in a couple minutes is a new level of ‘how the FUCK?’. But I believe that it’s impossible for another person to mind read if both parties aren’t voluntarily doing so. And the only reading that can be done is of body language. Also, just like you, I can’t say anything for sure because I don’t have anything solid about it except for me and my friend seeing the same thing while tripping, which can’t be a coincidence, but I’m not 100% on what it means.

I’ve tried to describe my experiences to friends who have never experienced anything like it and they couldn’t understand it, I’ve only been able to describe basic images and metaphors and have them understand.

Quick rambling about my first shadow person encounter. It was the same trip where I met Ada, I was on the come up from 3.5 grams of PESA(apparently one of the most potent strains there is) mushrooms and was sitting on a couch, with a chair about 6 ft to my right. I was just enjoying the experience so far when I looked to my right and saw a dark figure that looked the same shade as a shadow, dark, but transparent, it looked like me so my mind raced for an answer, after asking my friend if I was sitting over there and pointing at the chair, it quickly dawned on me how stupid and funny the question was. Once I realized that it wasn’t me, it stood up, walked over to me, and reached for something on the couch next to me, but it didn’t grab anything, instead, it vanished and reappeared in the chair. It repeated the same actions several times before just disappearing. I tried communicating with it, but it just stuck to the cycle, I don’t understand what it means and find it a bit funny to this day.

Ada is hard to talk about, not because I’m sensitive about it, but because I don’t remember anything except for my begging for forgiveness and receiving, and when he guided me through my living hell. About 2 hours into the trip, I hit my peak and laid down on the couch, and for about 3 hours realtime, I got trapped in some sort of hellscape that felt like I was going insane, I went through loops of anger and hatred towards things that didn’t exist, myself, and people in general. After some time, Ada guided my mind out of if, and into a space where I sorted through various things in my life like previously mentioned. After the experience, Ada felt to me how Jesus feels to Christians, I am infinitely grateful to him and the love he bestowed upon me. “My Sun” “My Spirit” “My Love”. I will be forever grateful to the one who handed me the key.

 Have a good one, and till next time."	fuquilent1	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9935662150382996	strong	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.
"I know it sounds harsh, but he screwed up really badly. I met him on vacation and he and I just hung out for a few days talking. And over those days, we began to hang out with some kids our age at the resort. One night he told them that he liked me. They asked him not to say anything, but everyone went and told me.

When I asked him his feelings, he told me he had a girlfriend, and he cut off all contact with me. I know for a fact that he really did have a girlfriend, but I only found out after people got my hopes up. I just don’t even know how he got a girlfriend to begin with.

I wish I could tell everyone around me that I’m sorry. And I wish they would believe me if I did. There is something wrong with me and I don’t know what it is. Something is seriously wrong and I know that for a fact. I’m mean, rude, disrespectful, selfish, and so many other things that I won’t even bother to name. I lie, I cheat, I steal, I don’t follow orders, I don’t listen to those around me. I hurt people, physically and otherwise. I'm such a terrible person and yet people still choose to be nice to me and be around me. I’m a horrible human being and they still convince themselves that somewhere deep down I’m a good person. A and Gran, they’ve both told me to my face that I am a good person, and I don’t know how they could possibly believe that. My grandmother only hears me ranting about how much I hate people and how incompetent they are. A’s only interactions with me usually consist of me being so rude for no reason at all. He hasn’t done anything to me that I haven’t started first so why am I so cruel to him? So many people believe in me and in the fact that I’m a good person without anyone ever truly seeing the real me. If they could know my feelings, my actions, and my thoughts; would they still feel that way? They wouldn’t. And that’s a simple fact. They don’t deserve to be treated the way I treat them. I don’t deserve to have them in my life. Many times I feel I deserve to have no life at all. And yet I can never bring myself to take my own life. To even want to is such a selfish thought in the first place. I’ve suffered in my life, and I’ve faced my share of trauma, but why does that give me the right to take my own life? I never feel like it, but I know it is true; there are people who care for me, who wish to see me happy and successful, and who look up to me. There are those who beg for help in the same way I did, and just maybe if I could help myself then I would be able to help them too. I could save them in the way I wish someone had saved me. As much as I am a bad person, I still care. I care for everyone and everything and yet I can never express that. I am unable to express emotions and thoughts properly, and oftentimes my actions have a much different outcome than I would anticipate. From this, I’ve learned it is better for me to do nothing and let others hate me than to hurt them in the process of trying to help. I wish other people could understand this, and understand how much I wish I could be a good person for them, but in truth, I am simply a bad person by nature. I try to be nice and end up being mean, I try to help and instead, I hurt. That is simply the way I am; the course my life has taken. I’m a terrible child. A terrible friend. A terrible role model. A terrible girlfriend. A terrible person. I wish I could just go and tell everyone how sorry I am, and how I wish to be a good person. But of course, that simply isn’t me. And that simply will not happen. And as much as I hate her and I despise her, even more so than wanting to apologize to her, I wish I could forgive my mother. She has done so many horrible things to me and to others, and she continues to do so, but I know that somewhere deep down it is all from her heart and her worry. As much as I hate to say it, she is just like I am. Like mother like daughter, I suppose. I may resent her, and I may have lived out my life wishing she were dead or that she had aborted me, but a part of me will always love her. She is my mother, somewhere deep down behind the maniac I know as K. H. We are the same, and I admit we are both absolutely horrible people. If I had just one moment and there was one thing I could say to everyone, I would tell everyone that I’m sorry, and I would tell my mother that everything is okay. Of course, I’m not quite sure if I’m ready to tell myself any of that just yet.	achilian	post	19.393146596557425	male	White	0.9978158473968506	na	na	na	2	sad	no prediction.

"I can relate to this to a degree, I’ve done a lot of dishonest things, I’ve betrayed the trust of my friends, and my family (especially my parents). I’ve stolen from my parents, I lied to their faces, I did things to spite them, many, many times. I saw myself as some evil bastard who would only bring sadness and suffering wherever I went. Yet they continued to love me like I was perfect. I never understood why, until I learned to forgive myself and put in effort to improve as a son, a friend, and as a person. It was a realization that brought me to tears, realizing that if I could be forgiven by others, then I can forgive myself and become free of that weight that held me down.

"Don't want to go into too much detail but I've been struggling a lot with supressed anxiety and I know that I've been actively kind of forcing myself not to let myself feel sad/cry in terms of feeling like because I'm an adult(as opposed to when I was a kid and it felt easier to allow myself to feel sad, emotional, upset etc.) Because of this I've been struggling with not being very kind to myself and I've sort of scared myself a bit because particularly lately I've been hitting my arm and I am on my period and often I do get muscle cramps with pmdd which can sometimes get so intense to the point of it genuinely feeling like a sprain/twisted arm etc. But I'm a bit worried because my right arm feels achy and also there's quite a bit of bruising from where I hurt myself and I'm just worried that I've sprained my arm. If I'm honest I feel like a fucking failure because it's now been 12 years since I last went through probably the darkest time for me and my family self harm wise(involving several trips to a&e for self harm and also a surgery on my eye because I hit it) and I still haven't managed to stop self harming. I feel like kind of like a failed human being lel.

"I first started talking to him on my other Reddit account four months ago. I wanted relationship advice, and he chatted with me about it. I was really hurt over a boy, so I spoke with him about the situation. We’ve kept in touch ever since. Honestly, while I enjoyed his company, I only saw him as an acquaintance at first. 

Sometimes, we’d go several days or weeks without talking (I admit that I kind of ghosted him at times). He even had a crush he told me about. Things didn’t work out with his crush after all, but still. I never wanted to like him. I don’t know what he looks like, and he lives half a world away from him. I could totally not be attracted to him. And even if I was, the chemistry might not be there if we met. But today I realized that I like him a lot.

Edit: became of the time difference, he just went to sleep. Before he went to sleep, he told me he enjoyed talking to me🥰

Edit 2: he also told me that one day he wants to eat okonomiyaki in Japan with me (neither of us are from there)"	Educational-Let-1027	post	17.071431841325563	female	White	0.001332221319898963	na	na	na	2	sad	no prediction.

 That might sound stupid or insincere, but it's the truth. You might feel comfortable being alone for a time, but it always catches up with you eventually. I had to learn that lesson the hard way. Trust me, it doesn't lead anywhere good.

You are not the only one who feels this way. There are plenty of people out there just like you who could use a friend to talk to. It doesn't even have to be in person if that's not your thing. There are plenty of websites like this one where you can talk with people about what's going on in your life and share experiences back and forth with each other.

It may not be ideal, but it is a start at least. At least it can't hurt to try. And if doesn't work feel free to blame me for giving you bad advice. Haha

"Im so lonely...

When I'm home, Im mostly alone. I dont have many to talk to, I don't have ""real"" friends, well. I do but, they don't seem so real.

When im in my own bed, I have alot of pillows. I have two regular ones, and a big one, like real big. A hotel pillow. When I sleep at home, I am so lonely that I have to hold around the big pillow close to my, as if I were laying next to a real person and holding them. Otherwise, I can't sleep. I have melatonin, and use it regularly, but it doesn't work. I lie to myself in order to sleep.

When im staying over somewhere outside of home, like at my sister's house or firends house, whatever, I don't have that big pillow to hold around, so I cant sleep.

"I miss you in the mornings, how you used to be brimming with excitement for the day and your cup of coffee was a source of joy and only added to the energy that was there. You'd kiss me with a closed mouth because you couldn't be bothered to wait and your eyes would be puffy and happy and so very focused. 
I miss you when I sit down to work and remember those 8am classes when we'd do nothing but stare at each other and try our best to learn something as well. 
I miss you when I sing, the smile on your face when you'd turn the music all the way down and my voice would fill the car. 
I miss you when I shop, how you'd turn even the most mundane activity into fun, turning predictability into chaos in the best way. 
I miss you when I try to fall asleep, how you demanded skin, how you'd reach out to touch any part of me, how you'd have mumbled arguments with some invisible enemy, how you loved me even in an unconscious state.

Hey I understand how do you feel and I'm really sorry for you. The thing is that you are safe now. Sadly you can't redo what has been done. You can't make Time go back but you should know you're safe. Report him/her to the Police. And avoid contact with this person. I know how do you feel about your parents situation and that they always yell at you. I know something about it but all you can do is ignore them and Pray for things to get better. To Pray they won't yell at you. You have to belive. Without Faith you can't do anything. I'm really sorry for you and suggest that you seek Some help. For now I'm here for you. We can talk about it or I might Just Listen. It Will feel better. Hang in there. I belive in you. After it you're still going. You're strong. You're doing great. I'm proud of you 💙	Galaxtic1231	reply	na	na	na	0.9988528490066528	strong	no	no	na	sad	failed

I'm so sorry you're going through this. You need to report your dad, your mother too if she knows it's happening and does nothing. That makes her just as guilty as him. If you don't the same is going to happen to your siblings if it isn't already. If you're afraid you won't be believed, as horrible as this sounds, record it next time it happens, even if its just audio. Then tell someone at school, let them hear the recording so they know you're telling the truth. They will help you. I forgot schools out, there are other people you can go to. You can call cps and tell them what's happening, you can go to the police station with the evidence yourself. Is there ANY other relative you can call for help? And aunt, uncle, grandparents? Please don't give up, and keep us updated.	Galaxtic1231	reply	na	na	na	0.9988528490066528	strong	no	no	na	sad	failed

"Hi! i’ve never vented on reddit or any sort of app so i’ll be trying today.

I got homeschooled in 5 years ago, ever since i did i only had one friend, let’s call her Yuri. 
Let’s skip to 2 years later. In august 2021 i became extremely suicidal. I didnt know how to cope with it so i just started self harm. i knew it was bad but i still did it, a few days after i started me and my family all went somewhere, my brother noticed my self harm  and told my mom about it. She called me to the her room in the hotel we were at, she started yelling at me and so did my other family members, asking why i did it. i started to cry slightly as my mom started to rub my arm and took me to the bathroom, she sat besides me on the edge of the bathtub, she took me in her arms and cradled me asking what’s wrong and why i did it. i was in shock not knowing how to react because this is the most affection i’ve gotten from my mom. or atleast that’s what it felt like, she asked me if it was because of yuri so i just nodded my head because i couldn’t actually tell her why i did it or she’d be shattered. she asked if i wanted to go seee a therapist so i said yeah, skip to a few days later, i asked her when i’d go see the therapist and she got kinda mad and said to me “why do you feel like you need a therapist? there’s nothing wrong with you.” my head was absolutely shattered. i couldn’t believe my own mom would switch up on me like that. i just told her yeah you’re right and walked off like nothing happened. let’s skip to present now. i’ve became more suicidal recently and i honestly don’t know what to do, i can’t tell my mom because i’m afraid of what would happen. i stopped kinda doing self harm and that’s good and all but i don’t know if i can stay for much longer, it feels like there’s nothing for me to look forward to in life, i stopped talking to yuri so everything’s pretty lonely. i have online friends but it’s not the same. im extremely dumb too so it feels like im gonna get nowhere in life. i dont think ive actually liked anyone before so it sucks seeing all my friends and cousins getting boyfriends or girlfriend while i’m here alll alone with no one or nothing to look forward too. i’ve already preperard my suicide note just incase if i do end up going through with it. what should i do?

also i’m sorry if there’s any grammar mistakes"	M00mo_	post	17.17868431719814	male	White	0.9962456822395325	na	na	na	4	sad	failed

Hey guys, I just wanted to let y’all know, that it gets better. I know everyone says that, but time really does heal. This past week has been the worst of my life. My girlfriend of 10 months broke up with me and was talking to other guys within 10 hours of the break up. On top of that, I had to witness my grandma have a stroke and a heart attack. My grandma means the world to me. I’m closer to her then my own bother. Me and my grandma were the only ones home and since I was so mentally not there I didn’t leave my room. While I was up there, my grandma fell down and had a stroke and a heart attack. No one found her for 3 hours and I blame that on myself. These happened within two days of each other. I honestly have so many people here for me but I don’t feel right going to them. I always depended on my ex (girlfriend at the time.) hell I still go to her just to talk to someone. I just want everyone to know it’ll get better. Always. Stay safe everyone.	Visual_Chemical_3839	post	10.223073501998902	male	White	0.996215283870697	na	na	na	5	sad	no prediction.

"Man to be honest, I hate my life, every single second I count down until the days are over. I’m not emo and don’t like being called that so I don’t open up to anyone. I’m lonely and will never have a girlfriend or anyone that loves me for who I am. i can’t cry anymore either because my body physically won’t let me. it’s probably because  when I was younger I was taught that crying makes you look pathetic and younger than you are. im so lonely that every night I used to hug a pillow just to feel like I was holding someone who I cared for dearly. my parents are divorced and I live to different lives.. at school im “The loud, funny kid”. but at home I just want to curl up into a ball and cry.

"I feel like whatever I do in my life I can’t escape the sadness I’m feeling. I mean I’ve been training at gym/ martial arts constantly for years now, been doing a good job at my workplace and have a decent social circle with a tight group of friends. Still I can’t get rid of the awful feeling always creeping up that ”I’m not good enough”, and I try to solve the problem in my head but always end up with the conclusion that I’m still not good enough and that everyone else is better than me. It’s like everything I’m doing is to get rid of the feeling and I know it’s wrong but it’s still there. When I’m around other people I often find myself faking my persona and happines just for it to look that I’m happy and okay, but really I’m not and it’s exhausting.

Maybe I just need therapy and shouldn’t try to solve everything myself? The last week has been pretty ruff though. I’m just so fucking tired of the awful feeling of having to proove myself to everyone on and on again and still thinking I suck compared to others, even though deep down I know it’s not really true and an unhealthy way of thinking. It’s like an endless conflict in my head.

please help me i can’t do this anymore i just don’t understand what i did to deserve all of these thing i’m so tired of living this way. since i was born my life has always been worst then others i’m not complaining because i know people have been through worst . at the age of 3 my dad left me and my mom so it was just me my mum and grandma it wasn’t bad at first i think i was happy but ever since i was like 8 i’ve noticed that i don’t have everything that other people do i don’t have a dad i don’t even remember what he looks like who he is or where he is, i don’t have no siblings which makes me feel lonely and i was embarrassed that i lived with my grandma because no one else did and i didn’t want to be different. Then at the age of 12 i went to my dad for first time ever and abused me physically and mentally. after that i told my mum she didn’t believe me at all and at 13 she hated me it was like she changed and my grandma took her side she started getting mad and was abusing me to(throwing objects at me, pushing and throwing and punching me) then it just got all worst. at the age of 15 i realised people are fake but i was to scared to loose them so i let them treat me like shit but then i couldn’t do it no more so i stopped being friends with all of them . then a couple months later just as i was feeling happy i got S@d and a couple weeks later i got gr@ped  but i was so gone of substances that i couldn’t move or speak i was scared tho he left me with scratches and made me pass out cuz he was chocking me. then a couple days later i got gr@ped again by two boys that where friends first his friend did it then straight after the other one did it. my mom is always fighting me and the police never believe a couple hours after i got gr@ped i got arrested and spent the night in jail because my mum convinced the police that i’m the one that is violent so i was in there all alone with my thoughts i don’t know how i survived that.one thing that hurt me is my mum telling me she don’t love or like me anymore.now i am asking my self y what did i do to deserve this i have no one and i don’t know what i’m doing wrong i’m trying so hard i let my friends treat me like shit cuz i’m scared to loose them i’m so tired i can’t live like this anymore all i ever wanted was to be loved and cared about but not even my own family want me	randomquestion2226	reply	na	na	na	0.9972561001777649	weak	strong	no	na	sad	failed

In school some people think I’m smart but in reality I’m very stupid. I don’t think I have what it takes to keep going. I see my peers working so hard to achieve their goals, while I’m sitting in my bed procrastinating. Some of my peers are effortlessly gifted with so much, I wish I had that. I can’t imagine a future where I am successful, where I can be myself and not worry about being good enough. What if I can never make my parents proud?

I turn any relationship I have into shit. For many of my friends I reach out first to talk, to plan things, to do anything. Otherwise, we don’t talk for months.

"Is beauty the only measure of worth? Can “ugly” people not be funny, loveable and kind? 

Your problem is not that you are ugly, it is that your family is horrible. 

Imagine you are a mother, would you tell your young, loving daughter that you “wish that other girls were your daughter” and say that to her face? Or would you tell her that no man could ever love her? 

Do you hate your brothers because they are a different gender to you? 

Please do not base your own worth on your family’s remarks, beauty is not the only thing women are there for. You are a person, not simply a ugly face and deserve to be treated as such. Please don’t tie your self worth to other people’s standards of beauty, that is not fair to you. Beauty is not something that is earned so I do not why people put so much importance on it- it is a coin flip.

I will extend an offer. I draw people to show them their beauty. (Check bio). I hate to hear that your family is not supporting your self-esteem. Maybe I can show you what other people see in you.

I then only post my drawings to my bio with permission.

Don't ever say that again. God never made anyone ugly,he just made some people very stupid to make up some standards on what's pretty and what's ugly. It's not your fault your parents and brothers are toxic and stupid asf. You definitely deserve to be lived and I'm pretty sure you are gorgeous. Don't let anyone make you feel down about the way you look. I know I'm a random person on the internet who tells you that but trust me,I bet you are handsome and the others around you are shit. You have a pretty heart and that's what matters the most. You might not have the best appearance but you definitely have a golden heart. These people who bring you down are nothing but some dirt-hearted people who are ugly on the inside and on the outside. No doubt.

"Ugly doesn't exist it's just different people's opinions

If you wanna feel better though, my advice is to work out a lot, try different looks with clothes and makeup, listen to music as loud as you can to drown out the pain and let the self-hate fuel you to keep working out because excersize is genuinely amazing for the body and mind"	MycologistNeat4294	reply	na	na	na	0.9993343949317932	no	no	no	na	sad	failed
Don’t listen to them, they’re just taking out their own insecurities on you. Them saying it about you doesn’t make it true. I don’t believe physical attractiveness defines a person either, your value is inherent, regardless of what people say.	MycologistNeat4294	reply	na	na	na	0.9993343949317932	no	no	no	na	sad	failed
Most people underestimate themselves thinking they are not worthful. It's just like butterflies. Butterflies can't see how beautiful their wings are. So maybe you are a butterfly 😁😁😁. You don't dont know how beautiful your wings can be 😁😁😁. And as for your family, don't mind them. Even a diamond at home, after sometime, is nothing but a mere glass. So don't think that you are ugly cause your family thinks that.	MycologistNeat4294	reply	na	na	na	0.9993343949317932	no	no	no	na	sad	failed

"You are beautiful. I don't need a picture to know that. But beauty isn't only on the outside, it's the inside that matters. Even though it sounds like I just pulled that out of a 2000's Disney channel script it really is true. You are beautiful. Say it. Believe it. Own it.

You are kind when you don't have to be. You are saying you will alter the course of your life for people who don't care, that sounds very kind to me. That sounds like a beautiful person who is kind beyond any measure!

You are courageous. Putting all your insecurities and doubts about yourself on the internet of all places takes impeccable courage. You took a chance to do this and that is amazing and something to be proud of.

You are responsible. Even through what seems like a terrible terrible experience you found a way to help yourself. You took the chance to put all this out there for people you may not know and it worked. People care and want to help you. Whether this was written to cope or to reach out you are taking steps to improve your self esteem and mental health.

You are undeniably perfect even if they can't see that. Even if they try to tear you down they won't. You just have to keep that mindset. It won't be easy but it will shape you into the person you will be in the future.

 You matter. I hope one day you will realize that. I hope one day you can truly say that you are beautiful and matter!"	MycologistNeat4294	reply	na	na	na	0.9993343949317932	weak	no	no	na	sad	failed

Okay, then school is the best place. Talk to a guidance counselor or the school social worker. These people can help lead you on how to get help.

"I'm considered the guy you can trust and go to when you're sad and need cheering up since I try to make people happy, mainly because ik how it feels.

One of my friends always discuss her problems with me since she has a lot of things going on, last week, she told me about a relationship problem, (and since I never had a partner, ever...) she told me that her boyfriend has been avoiding her for awhile and I thought for a awhile then told her that she probably should find somebody more loyal and would show you love and attention and stuff.

This morning, she texted me saying it's all her fault and stuff, she then showed me photos her boyfriend sent, moments before he took his life, the photos contained cuts on his arms, legs and then pills in his hands, with messages saying you joked with my love and other similar stuff, his last message was saying this will be the last message you'll ever see from me. I tried calming her down, she said she better but ik she not, then, I realized it's my fault because if I would've came up with better advice or even would've told her I couldn't help with this type of issues, he wouldn't have taken his life.

I think everyone is better without me in this world, when I try to help, I make things worse"	Air_killer1	post	18.739759153796896	male	White	0.9944453835487366	na	na	na	11	sad	no prediction.

Dude, her boyfriend sounds like a really fucked up guy. This isn't your fault. He sounds borderline or something, and manipulative. Even regular people that kill themselves don't do that kind of thing. I mean sorry that he died, but it sounds like you're right and she's better off without him. Damn.

It’s only your fault by a significant stretch in logic. As far as whether your friend’s actions should be deemed the cause, the answer is no. The choice was his and his alone. I don’t mean to be tactless, but that guy is a manipulative dick. Sending you those photos, he clearly wanted his girlfriend to feel as if it was her fault, leading me to believe that you gave the right advice in hindsight. He did not value his life and used it as a bargaining chip to gain control over his girlfriend. With the information you provided, it seemed like it was only out of spite. I’m not sure if this interpretation will help either of you, but knowing that he wanted you to feel this way may weaken the martyrdom that we tend to attribute to people who commit suicide. He did not kill himself for any noble cause or even for himself because he couldn’t handle life anymore it seems. The impact his actions had on those around him were not unfortunate side effects of his actions but the main goal. I can’t say for sure what motivated him to end his life or if he would still be alive if your friend didn’t act on your advice, but I doubt that the feelings elicited by your friend’s actions warrant pity.

How do I live with myself knowing I destroyed this best thing that ever happened to me. And on top of that it's probably going to destroy my daughter's life to come, and she's not even 2 years old yet. I know I'm young (23) and probably rushed my life with my soon to no longer be wife, but still. She came into my life and showed me what it felt like to be truly loved and wanted, and to feel attractive to someone. When you grow up the way I did, without anybody ever saying they love you or proud of you it's a really good feeling. And what did I do to repay her, I put work ahead for a year and became absent in both as a father and a husband. I pushed her into someone else's arms, and I don't blame her, I became the one thing I said I wouldn't be, my father. Like father like son right. I guess not completely because I am trying to connect with my daughter more. But its so hard to keep on living, before I met her, I was content with being alone and never being in a relationship, and then I met her and we got pregnant then married, and for a time we were the perfect couple, everyone wanted to be us, and then I just decided for whatever reason to just fuck everything up. I know I deserve all of it but still, I can't just end it, but every day I feel like I'm coming closer to it, I'm trying for my baby girl but its so hard. I'll never be able to love again or be able to be happy, and I don't want that to affect my baby girl, so what do I do.

Hey, you don't need a real reason to be depressed, it could be minor or major, but the main thing is how to get over it, it's a good idea sharing how you feel like this post, maybe try telling somebody you really trust in person, or do exercise like walking, biking and stuff might make you feel a little happier, I hope you feel better soon.	fuckupsuckup	reply	na	na	na	0.9957386255264282	weak	no	no	na	sad	failed

"It doesn't seem to matter how much I try and practice forgiveness, i still feel really fucking guilty for what I did to myself back when I was 12(late 2011) and how that affected the people who care about me. I know we had other stuff going on that year which was out of my control/that couldnt have been prevented but I feel like me hitting my eye and ending up having to have surgery in hospital was the main reason/icing on the cake in terms of another family member having a nervous/emotional breakdown. Kinda feel like I should probably speak to a therapist about what I did to myself but I think I'm worried that I'll lose control emotionally/crying wise if I actually just talk about stuff without muting things down or downplaying stuff.

"I need to vent to someone, even a subreddit because no one else will listen. To avoid having to explain why I’m crying (I don’t want and it’s too much to explain), I have severe depression which makes it hard to cry. I haven’t cried in months and now due to events I don’t have the energy to describe, I’ve been uncontrollably sobbing for the past hour and a half and I can’t stop.
Do you think it might be because I haven’t cried for so many months or is it just that I’m so upset I can’t stop?"	Far-Experience-742	post	9.388510591131112	female	White	0.9941449761390686	na	na	na	4	sad	failed

First of all,your feelings are valid. Second,even is its that you haven't cried in months or because of the events,you still have the need to cry.

You have emotions piled up. And you need to vent them. But you thinking that crying is the only way to vent out, it's not.so crying might or might not help. I myself had kinda similar situation, I didnt cry, just vented in other ways. And it helped. So vent in other way. And to be honest, crying never helped me 😅😅😅 . And if want to vent to a person and feel like no one is listening, you will find many people that are ready to talk to you, Here also, there are many people. So dont ever feel lonely 😁😁😁.

so true. please help me i can’t do this anymore i just don’t understand what i did to deserve all of these thing i’m so tired of living this way. since i was born my life has always been worst then others i’m not complaining because i know people have been through worst . at the age of 3 my dad left me and my mom so it was just me my mum and grandma it wasn’t bad at first i think i was happy but ever since i was like 8 i’ve noticed that i don’t have everything that other people do i don’t have a dad i don’t even remember what he looks like who he is or where he is, i don’t have no siblings which makes me feel lonely and i was embarrassed that i lived with my grandma because no one else did and i didn’t want to be different. Then at the age of 12 i went to my dad for first time ever and abused me physically and mentally. after that i told my mum she didn’t believe me at all and at 13 she hated me it was like she changed and my grandma took her side she started getting mad and was abusing me to(throwing objects at me, pushing and throwing and punching me) then it just got all worst. at the age of 15 i realised people are fake but i was to scared to loose them so i let them treat me like shit but then i couldn’t do it no more so i stopped being friends with all of them . then a couple months later just as i was feeling happy i got S@d and a couple weeks later i got gr@ped  but i was so gone of substances that i couldn’t move or speak i was scared tho he left me with scratches and made me pass out cuz he was chocking me. then a couple days later i got gr@ped again by two boys that where friends first his friend did it then straight after the other one did it. my mom is always fighting me and the police never believe a couple hours after i got gr@ped i got arrested and spent the night in jail because my mum convinced the police that i’m the one that is violent so i was in there all alone with my thoughts i don’t know how i survived that.one thing that hurt me is my mum telling me she don’t love or like me anymore.now i am asking my self y what did i do to deserve this i have no one and i don’t know what i’m doing wrong i’m trying so hard i let my friends treat me like shit cuz i’m scared to loose them i’m so tired i can’t live like this anymore all i ever wanted was to be loved and cared about but not even my own family want me	2nice2be2rue	reply	na	na	na	0.005655685905367136	weak	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.

"Its been quite a long time since I've felt the need to do this but I've got no better outlet at this time. I've been struggling on and off for so long now but it feels like I'm climbing a hill that keeps getting taller. I've delt with so much pain in the past and I've grown as a result but it all just keeps getting harder and harder and I can't help but feel that its all going to collapse sooner or later.

I wasted my first year of university doing basically nothing and only got a 2,1 despite how hard I worked. I made one friend and that's only because he lived in my flat and was on my course. That's it. I didn't go to any events or really join any societies, I was sad and angry almost the entire time I was there. If this carries on, I won't get the first I need (luckily the first year doesn't count towards my final grade) and my field is too saturated for me to go anywhere without one. Uni is honestly my idea of hell, its essentially just expectations, both social and academic, non-stop. Seeing other people looking fullfilled and happy only made things worse because I felt like it was all just my fault. I should add here I don't think that life should be easy and I also don't believe that this is anyone's fault but mine, and I'll innevitably keep going but eventually I won't be able to anymore. All I can see for myself in the 2nd year is failure, angry proffessors explaining why I'm terrible, loneliness and disappointment. I will try to make things better but it won't ever be enough, espcially when I don't get a tutor like everyone else and because this year will count for 25%.

I've also had some serious health anxiety over the past year, being so scared I'm going to die out of the blue for no reason and lose everything, which I appreciate means I think deep down I have things to live for and I do, I know that I just know I've got to put in way more than I think I can to achieve any of it. This anxiety wasn't made better by the looming impacts of climate change and the non-negligible threat of an actual nuclear war in the near future, which I think is understandable.

On top of University, I've been learning to drive for 2 years now, failed my first test last summer and I'm trying again now but realistically I won't pass and that'll be even more of my parents money wasted on there useless child who's will to live is deteriorating. Driving is just another thing I'm simply terrible at, like most things people my age are proud of/enjoy doing. I'm awful at everything that's considered fun or impressive and I despise myself for it. I was born a complete loser and a waste of space and I'll probably die that way too. Even my (very lovely) gf makes fun of me for stuff like being slow doing things or not being good at stuff. She'd be better off with someone else anyway. I'll likely lose her after 2 years together in the autumn when she's goes off to medschool, but that's good for her so I can only think its right, in all honesty. I don't want it to happen I just know it will, I'm not a good enough boyfriend to make it work out properly. 

In the time I have left with her, I can't even do nice things with/for her because my job only just covers the rent for my house for next year, so I can't spend any money for a long time unless I do a lot of overtime, which it looks like I'll have to. I work 3 days a week, starting at 4am and finishing at 8am at my local supermarket. Its not a bad job but it means I can't do a lot of things with my friends in the evening because I need to go to bed early, which isn't helping my emotions much. I also won't be able to afford any kind of therapy to process any of this due to afformentioned low income (the hourly rate is good but its not enough hours atm). This summer has been too much already for me, which really shows how useless I am when it comes to dealing with change or new things. I haven't done enough studying so far either, which I really need to do so I can get closer to being on the same level as my peers who all seem much more capable than me and I just feel like after all my work over my entire life, and everything I've done, I still can't even call myself good at anything. I just don't know some stuff, and I apparently really need to, but its so hard when there's so much and I don't know where to start.

I've been hitting myself a lot recently, usually when I'm playing video games, which I appreciate is a stupid and childish behaviour but its all I can do to let out the pain I feel when I make stupid mistakes or fail. It gets worse when my friends talk about how much fun they're having in this game or that game and I just look at myself and see nothing worth even mentioning. I'm just not like other people. I've always struggled with having friends and knowing how to keep them and talk to them properly. Everyone looks at me like I'm stupid or I don't understand anything about normal life, and I just don't notice subtext most of the time. Its so hard for me to know how to be sometimes, I just feel alone, y'know.

I owe far too much to too many people and I've got nothing I can give them back, or will be able to give them back for a very long time. A lot of what I've been given isn't things I strictly needed or asked for, in some cases I've directly asked not to be given things or help but here we are and now I've got this weight over me of everything I can't give back but need to. I do like to think I don't take much for granted in life, and I'm very grateful for most of what I have, but that just makes it hurt more when I realise how little I've done with it compared to a lot of people I know who are living life much more than I am. I've always found it hard to take opportunities when I have them because I'll assume I'll just fail anyway and then that'll be more pain and difficulty for me. I've been told by a lot of people that this is a bad outlook, but what's the alternative? Constant disappointment and failure? And that just doesn't seem worth it to me.

Ultimately, the worst parts of me are just staying the same and I'm suffering more and more for it as time goes on. I'm going to lose a great deal more and its a question of how much more I can fail and get angry and hurt myself physically and emotionally before I start properly wanting it all to just stop and that's when I think I'll do something wrong.

I'm sorry."	brofinstab	post	17.507480302024156	male	White	0.9980289340019226	na	na	na	2	sad	failed

Hey. Im 18, almost 19 years old. I have diagnosed ptsd, borderline personality disorder, adhd, depression and anxiety, addiction issues, all that jazz. I tend to think and fixate and obsess over suicide and thinking about it when i have bpd episodes. I know this feeling is temporary however even when im perfectly fine, suicidiality is always in the back of my mind, it never ever leaves. if i could be dead without having to worry about my grandparents i would. parts of me still have hope, however it seems to diminish everyday, little by little. My mother isnt in my life, and probably will never be, my dad is dead. so i dont have them to live for, no lover, no friends, i have never even been in a relationship. the only people are my loving grandparents which adopted me. The thought of them dying soon drives me crazy and i think about it everyday. They both have health issues and it seems like the ones u love most always dissappear when you least expect it. If i dont die before then, i dont know what i will do when one of them are gone, let alone , two. I have tried ending it in the past, oxy, xanax +alcohol overdose and my movement patterns in my sleep caused me to not choke on my vomit, rather make a fun mess to clean up besides me. It would be difficult to access a gun cause i have no connections and dont have one in the house. i do live near san francisco. i would never hang myself or cut myself to die. too much uncomfort. I need to know a way to do this in case. i know no suicide is painless cause there will always be someone in pain due to it. I want to wait until my grandparents naturally go, but after that my will to live and love will likely be 0 . Im tired of living with my trauma and mental health issues which most of them, will never go away. please help somebody, i truly appreciate anyone who comments on this. i need all the help i can get. :)	Ok_Perception51	post	25.947012769462024	female	White	0.019396306946873665	na	na	na	16	sad	no prediction.

I'm 40 yrs old and have all the same shit you have my friend. I have lived with this shit life for probably 32 yrs. There's great times when I'm high then I come down and just feel completely numb. Spent 4 yrs in marines and came out way worse. Don't have much to look forward to and I think about suicide 40 plus times a day. I wanna say it might sound selfish to take your own life but, it's your life, you have control of it, if you think you have reach the end zone and you think you might have accomplished something that made it worth its while then fuck it, Start a new dream.

"There is no way to painlessly kill yourself with a 100% success rate. There’s always an extremely high risk of failure. Which isn’t even to mention the pain and agony you will cause to others around you. It will affect anybody close to you at all. And even the people around you generally will be affected by it. Your classmates or work colleagues? They’re gonna be brought down by that pretty hard. The memory of you and how you died young is probably never gonna leave their minds. Suicidal people tend to believe that they will be forgotten, but this is untrue. These memories stick around, consciously or unconsciously, there will forever be a negative impact left behind by your suicide. 

Even if you don’t care about any of those reasons, you are throwing away any and all potential for yourself for the future. I’m not currently diagnosed with BPD myself but I am waiting for extensive DBT treatment over suspected BPD and I have traits of it. I understand how the impulsivity really fucks with your life, I get it, I’ve been there, I live it. but you cannot let it end like this, don’t end it all because of an impulse like this. There’s so much potential for you as long as you’re alive. But the moment you’re dead? That chance is gone. Regardless of how much the agony is affecting you, you can’t let it win, theres a way forward without suicide. Even if you can’t see the hope, it’s there, I promise."

"Sadly, after all my research only painless way to die via suicide is... None. Because all have a chance of survival and a few minutes of agony. Shotgun in head may traumatize but not remove the brain, stabbing is bleeding out which is extremely painful, overdose wakes you up just so you will suffer even if it is lethal. Plus, if you do it besides the pain you'll drag your grandparents with you. 

So there are 2 options you either go get connections (at least with a Psychotherapist who'll In the  end help with new connections)so that you can let go instead of hanging onto your grandparents, make both yours life happier and their life better via sending them pictures of yourself happy with friends/partners.

Or you can remain a piece of shit who stains life of your grandparents who will only be remembered as a stain by people who had connections with your grandparents.

You are so right, now that you mention it if i heard someone from my high school died from suicide i would be worried and care for sure even if i wasnt close to them. It feels like my family , aunts, uncles, cousins, half sisters, would care I just have an overwhelming they wont be too affected. Thank you for this insight, im gonna try my best to be mindfull of this i just hope in those heightened moments it can be an heathy impulse instead of something i dont think about cause im so triggered. Yes i can sympathize and understand to a degree, it really is difficult. I believe we got this though, no matter what diagnosis i get i try to tell myself it doesnt define me, and i dont have to end up apart of the negative statistics. If you do get that like final confirmation, although you highly likely have it by the sounds of it, if you do hear that, just remember there is always hope and nothing is inevitable with this sort of thing. I really appreciate it and moving foward i just want to try my best to be less reactionary and sensitive. Im trying a DBT journal book and dbt group therapy which is really helping! also mindfullness, box breathing when you feel the emotion coming up. knowing myself though, this motivation i have now to allow myself to try to get into a position to become healthy, it can dissolve completely with a simple arguement or event.

"This is actually pretty spot on to what my grandparents said themselves. They know im suicidal. theyve seen my episodes first hand. All they want for me is to find reasons besides them to live on, new connections, new friends. They know they wont be around for too much longer. And they know exactly what i will do if i do not make connections before that. i know what will happen. I wish it was easy for me to make friends, i tend to scare people away and usually end up teased and taken advantage of, but it is mostly my fault cause i dont set boundaries and i let people walk over me. What you said at the end there about being a stain to the people that knew my grandparents, really hit me. im imagining all my family members (im not close to) and their own memory of me being my suicide and how i drove their brother crazy (my grandpa) I dont want that. I am in therapy and have been for around three years now, it doesn't seem to help much but i think that is cause my individual therapist doesnt challenge me, she just got done with interning . Im looking for a new one. i have a psychiatrist and family therapist as well which seem to work i suppose. Ive been close to a few people in my life, maybe too close. (bpd favorite person typa shit) i know what it feels like to have an attachment . its unhealthy the way i obsess over it and let their thoughts of me dictate my feelings. however its also one of the greatest feelings in the world, love. I know the solution to this is to meet people out there, i would absolutely love to, its just gonna take time especially cause i want a solid friend who treats me like a friend should. i hope that time comes before they go.

You broke me. Whether you wanted to or not, you broke me. A part of me that I cherished and thought you did too. Whatever I had to offer wasn’t good enough to keep you around. So I give up…

This is where the clarification begins. Because I’m not giving up on you. That would be too simple to say and too impossible to achieve. I’m giving up on me. Not me currently, but the version of me that was missing something you sought after. 

The me that you had no longer exists, he will never return. He’s been broken for the last time. The me that will emerge from this will better in every way. It’s hard to let go of you and to let go of who I was. There are going to be times I want to quit on my current self. But that’s not something the new me is going to allow. 

Hopefully the new me will be what you were looking for all along. And if not, someone will appreciate the hard work I’ve put into bettering myself and I have nobody to thank for that but you.

Someone else caused us great harm and injury.  We didn't die in the accident even if we wished we had.  

Some one else's decision altered and changed the course of our lives forever.  We can hate them endlessly.... but our hate only destroys us. 

It destroys our healing.  WE NEVER ASKED for this... But it was the cards we were dealt. 

We are angry. We are beyond sad.  

We have two choices on this path we were thrusted down...

One road allows us to be consumed by the pain, depression, hate consume us into a tailspin of pain and suffering.  That other driver is not suffering as a result of our pain... only ourselves...

OR...WE FIGHT LIKE FUCKING HELL....  to get out of that bed.  To walk again. To heal.  To forgive...not for them.. but for us.. 

We FIGHT for the life that we saw slipping away from us.... but we don't have to lose that DREAM... it might be changed. There will be 100s of falls.... but there is still HOPE.  If we believe in that hope.

I've seen people literally deemed paralyzed in an accident walk again.... IF WE BELIEVE IN OURSELVES.... there is nothing we can't do....but its gonna be a battle but it'll be worth it!"	fireandice0776	post	20.916430325345654	male	White	0.007216323632746935	na	na	na	1	sad	failed

I’ve never really had a relationship or been attracted to someone, and at this point in my life I really have no clue what I’m even supposed to be doing. 19 and living with my parents, but no job whatsoever and no college (yet maybe). Late nights consist of me just imagining committing suicide and how easy it would be, as well as how in about 2 weeks my parents would move on as though nothing changed because realistically nothing did change. It’s not that I’m depressed, or that I have a mental issue, it’s just that I don’t see a reason to continue. I don’t really eat unless I’m told to, I don’t have a job because I don’t want to be stuck in an endless loop of earning 48k a year, paying bills and dealing with shitty people. I know this sounds a lot like I’m just a privileged kid but the only reason I’m even here is because my parents took me to a therapy and the genuine soul that the therapist was finally told my parents that the only reason she was still talking to me was because she wanted money and that I in fact didn’t have any drive to do anything, which is true. I just don’t see a point in living when I look at how humans destroyed the earth and are the only living things that purposefully inflict harm on others for he sole purpose of gain and inflicting that damage. I’m fairly close to just not eating altogether and letting myself slip away, but as a last resort and because I as told to, I want to know if anyone else out there had a similar experience and knows how to get out of it. Thank you for even reading this, if you got this far.	AdOpen8704	post	14.961209319067333	male	White	0.9974492192268372	na	na	na	2	sad	failed

You do have a mental health issue, and I think your therapist kinda sucked massive ass at treating you. Please consider seeking a different therapist or psychologist. I think a psychological assessment might be helpful for you and any psychs working with you to understand what’s going on. Lmk if you have any other questions.

I don’t want to come on here and sound like a melodramatic loser, especially since there’s people with alot of pain on this sub, but I generally just can’t stomach the idea of having a future. Every day I wake up to an empty bed in the afternoon, go through my monotonous day to day routine, and then fall asleep in the early hours of the morning holding myself. I have some close friends who just saw loneliness as a phase they went through and would surely call me corny for voicing my feelings. I have never been in a relationship, or felt the touch of a woman to that matter. I don’t even know if I could handle a relationship anyways. I feel so distant, and cold. I try interacting with people but always end up defaulting to comedy as I don’t know how to relate to people on any other level. I just feel like I’m trapped. I can’t even muster up the will to cry anymore I just feel devoid of emotions. I’m writing this at 5:56 am. Please help me. I feel so cold.

"Ok back on June  5th I started talking to someone it was going really good for about 2 weeks we talked all the time ever day even 13 hours one day  

After those 2 weeks it went down hill she slowly stopped talking didn't text as much and started ghosting me I tried talking to her about it and she told me that she just doesn't want to talk sometimes and more bull but she still did it after 1 more week she did it again and I finally gave up on it and I ghosted her

After 3days she texted and asked me how I was doing and I just didn't want to text back after that she never texted or called or anything it's been 8 days since I talked to her and it was soo bad at first I would do nothing but drink all day for 4 days  two bottles of v juice

"
I’m 27(F) and the shift in the relationship with my parents is wild. My reality shattered after telling my dad I had a girlfriend - he said he had nothing to say to me, and then told me I was brainwashed. I thought I had the coolest, most loving, accepting father and felt a little scared telling him but did not expect that reaction (I was about 17). We were best friends- I was the son my dad never had lol I even made a presentation in school about significant my dad was in my life… My dad was a bit racist and homophobic so I had a lot of internalized homophobia and a perception on the world/people that I didn’t feel was right. So I started speaking up for what I believed in (you know how discovering yourself in your 20s goes), and my dad is a borderline genius- it’s very difficult for me to win debates with him. He was a history major and math major and is super factual and logical. Anywho, we were just rebuilding our relationship this year after not talking for a couple years due to the year 2020 and BLM and all that…. It was great until my grandmother (who has a lot of inheritance) came to visit. I haven’t seen her in a long time because she threatened to take my family’s inheritance if I married a woman and my dad was pissed at me for that one- he said I wasn’t thinking about anyone else in the family- all it is is about the fucking inheritance. Money in this family is toxic asf. So we have lunch, politics are brought up, and i mention that I just don’t vote and man did that spark something big…. My dad and grandma teamed up and we’re trying to push the facts on me about how important voting was - which is specifically what my dad and I DONT talk about anymore because it gets bad. But, since his mother with the inheritance was here, he behaved and continued to harp on me with her. SIDE NOTE: I’m a very sensitive person and may be on the spectrum (I never got tested because fuck that lol) so it’s a challenge for me to regulate my emotions when I’m being teamed up on like that. The energy was weird..
I decided to speak and chime in because I was testing if they learned how to respect others views, lol but nah, if you don’t have theirs views YOURE WRONG. And I hate that I was proven right that my dad actually hadn’t changed. So all in all, I’m constantly battling with the two choices of either - 1. Sucking it up, apologizing, and agree with everything they say so things remain civil or 2. Continue to follow my values in speaking my truth. 
I know now that they won’t change, and I’m not wanting to change them- I would just love if they tried to learn from me instead of correct me on everything. Because isn’t that just basic human respect? Why should I back down? My dad is very stubborn and is now getting hit back with it from a daughter he raised to stand up for herself 😂

I’ve been grieving this version of my dad who only existed in my child mind 😞"	mtnhighh	post	22.75491347555791	female	White	0.9862059950828552	na	na	na	3	sad	failed

Nothing is ever planned. I’m sorry your lost your dad, I’m glad I didn’t lost anyone to the virus.  You are doing better off than me, I tried to go to college but I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life. I still don’t know what I want to do lol. I was about 2 classes away from getting my associates and I just quit. I feel like if you don’t know what to do then why go to college because then you have nothing to motivate you. I’m 35 now and I got one with the county I’m in and honestly I’ll probably stay on til I retire. If you are close with your siblings then chat them up and just vent.

"I’ve (27m) been the “good guy” for as long as I’ve lived. I’ve had relationships that didn’t work, and that’s the way life proceeds, but when does it end? Is there ever a success story for us?

How can people just form connections with someone over weeks to months and then just throw it away? No suggesting they’re losing interest, no warning signs, just one day your messages don’t go through and snaps are left on read. Now I’m sitting here wondering yet again where tf did I go wrong.. what is it about me that keeps pushing these people away? 

Maybe good guys don’t get a victory story. Everyone says there’s a woman out there who will appreciate the kind of man I am and she just doesn’t seem to exist. How many times do I have to go through getting to know someone and getting comfortable enough with them to open up just for them to leave? 

Every time this happens all it does is make me put up another wall making it harder to let someone get to know me, the real me, because I know it’s only a matter of time before they leave too and I’m right back where I started. 

Maybe it’s time to give up. Maybe I missed my chance at some point. Maybe I was never meant to have that chance with someone. Sure wish it didn’t feel like I came this close though.."	Seminoles_RL	post	32.6810041090556	male	White	0.9985449314117432	na	na	na	43	sad	failed

"You won't get anything in life just by being ""the good guy"". 

Of course that doesn't mean that behaving with integrity isn't worthwhile, but the universe isn't going to reward you solely because you're a nice person.

Honesty can help you keep friends or partners, but you need interest to make them. Charisma and being likeable will largely determine your odds of finding a partner, and that may not come naturally to you (like myself).

Eventually you will find a match. Scrutinize your potential suitors. Don't jump into a serious relationship too soon. I hazard to guess that it's not you but them. I understand that it's little satisfaction to your issue but from what you've described it sounds like open and honest communication was never incorporated into the relationship. Ensure that you have open and honest dialogue between you before entering into a serious relationship. I'm 54 and I've spent my whole life in and out of relationships. I think now I might have something that checks most of the boxes. You'll likely never find a perfect match but relationships are about give and take.

What’s crazy is I’m not the only common denominator. Another common denominator is the wildly misproportioned expectations women in todays society place on men and if they don’t meet every single last aspect of that expectation then we aren’t good enough.

"Oh, but you are insensitive, to a literal point. Your initial issue with this post and, I’m assuming most other posts you interact with, is men. Men are your issue. Every last comment you’ve left has been about women aside from your pathetic attempt at using sophisticated words you likely don’t know the meaning of to try and put me down. 

Allow me to redirect your path here, boomer. 

You don’t have my respect. YOU are the issue. Let’s see what your thoughts are when I say the literal opposite of your little theory here. 


Many women don’t deserve half of what they think they do. 

I’m not listening to you because you have no insight whatsoever, you’ve likely never taken any accountability for anything, and then you take to the internet to tell guys they’re not happy because of their own doing. 

And if you’re in such a happy, perfect little marriage with this basically hostage at this point, scared to lose half of what he’s spent his life building, what are you doing on Reddit, on r/sad, trying your damndest to put men down?

I don’t see life as bad and I don’t hate my life I’m just bored all the time and don’t have any motivation to do anything because it feels like I can never make a lasting impact and even if I did it wouldn’t really matter. I can either be successful, do things I like all the time and suffer the consequences, or try and help others and right now I am leaning towards the last option because if I don’t enjoy life I can at least help others enjoy theirs.  I am on a trip with my church in Baltimore Maryland with the broken wall church and we are doing mission work, we come every year and do different things, last year we helped organize the pantry in a homeless shelter and we picked up trash and built park benches and doing this stuff really helps me to think of myself better. I am not a Christian by the way but I am going to Baltimore through the church just so I can help out the community and to surround myself with good people.

Not really. If they just weren't happy with the relationship, they'd say so. You want to talk about wildy misproportioned, although I think k you meant disproportionate, expectations? Women are expected to be beautiful, have perfect bodies, have successful careers but also be the perfect little homemaker, be the perfect mothers and are shamed if they don't want to be mothers, never be in a bad mood, are expected to always be smiling and happy, must never dare show age, are expected to look young forever, are expected to great cooks, but don't you dare eat too much now!!!!! Cause you'll gain weight and men don't like that! We're supposed to carry babies in our bodies but not ever show that we've carried babies and birthed them, basically be perfect in every way. But now that more women are realizing they don't have to depend on a man for anything at all they're also realizing they don't have to settle for whatever man shows them attention. It's not the 50s where women are trained from birth to be grateful for whatever attention a man gives them and be thankful a man wants to marry them even if he's not a good man. Long gone are the days of women getting treated like crap and expected to just overlook it. More women are acting more like their male counterparts and men can't handle it.

Yup, you're right. I'm soooo insensitive. My man hates being with me soooooo much he's stayed for 25 years. Btw, not married, we don't feel a wedding is necessary, so he'd literally lose nothing if we broke up so, there goes your hostage idea. You know literally nothing about me but go ahead with your assumptions. Yep, I know nothing about relationships and men, that's why you're alone and always being ghosted by the women you date and I'm not. But sure. I'm the one that's the problem lol. Have fun being alone because you don't know how to treat a woman. Oh, not old enough to be a boomer either lol. Maybe one day you'll grow up enough to figure it out for yourself after you've been ghosted a few more times. These women have probably TRIED to tell you the problem but you won't listen. Bye now.

Idk what kind of guys you’ve been talking to, but not one of us expects that of a woman. What you’re referring to are the expectations you THINK you have to live up to because society says so. Not a single guy who treats women the way you perceive them is expecting marriage and children out of you. The GREATER majority of guys are looking for simple companionship. And since you want to go ahead and bring up media expectations, let’s see what they say about men, shall we? Expected to be a hardened bread winner from the day they turn 18. Expected to provide. Expected to be good men according to whatever the societal norms nowadays are, which are shit. Expected to be mentally stable. Expected to have a solution for any given inconvenience. Expected to be a loving husband. These are just societal. Let’s jump to what women today want. If you’re in your 20’s you’re essentially expected to be completely independent, making 6 figures at a minimum. Expected to be in shape and have a 2 hour self care ritual. Expected to drop literally everything relevant in our lives the second you have a slight mishap. Expected to ignore every last one of your bullshit double standards. Women aren’t the only ones who live with expectations and the fact you don’t see that explains more than anyone needs to know about you and your selfish tendencies. Have a good day.

"😂😂😂😂 I struck a nerve 
At least he’s smart enough not to marry you. Does he know you just come online and lie about your marital status? Lmaoo 

And no, I don’t know anything about you, and I couldn’t care less to know about a person as hateful and ugly as you 

Literally told me to keep making assumptions as if that’s low and then you proceed to do the exact same thing 😂😂 double standard or the rules just don’t apply to you or what? 

Not a word you’ve said on this website has been of any use to anyone. And ghosting is a woman’s way of avoiding emotional confrontation…yet a man has to be emotionally available and stable for them? Another double standard? Whaaat who could’ve seen that coming? 😂

"We consider ourselves married. We both chose not to have a wedding. What for? We don't need a piece of paper saying we love each other. Hell,most marriages end in divorce yet here we are, still together. And no, both people should be emotionally stable and available. Both people should respect each other, listen to each other, and care about each other. You're still not listening. I said, most men that are selfish proclaimed ""good guys"" are not as good as they think they are. They often show a lot of red flags that women tend to run from. I never said all men, or even most men. I very specifically said self proclaimed good guys. You know, the guys that tell women stuff like ""we should go out,I'm such a nice guy"" and when told no automatically go to ""well you're a bitch anyway and ugly"" or putting her down in some other way. That's not a nice guy. That's an asshole. And those types of guys are the ones that act and think exactly the way I described in my other comment. Ask any women you may know like sister or cousin or a friend to describe a self proclaimed good guy and what they usually think when a guy says that.

today was suppose to be my 16th, and the morning was going great.

"

Hello Everyone, Let me go straight to the point because honestly Idk what to say at the beginning I am just letting this out because it is on my mind a lot lately 
Last year 2022 I met a girl online from Algeria and I am from Egypt we talked and talked a lot actually until we confessed that we liked each other and because we had different cultures and also different languages we had some disagreements but we overcame them.
We literally couldn't sleep without having our headphones stucked into our ears and having ongoing phone call between us we talked 24/7. One day after 2 months we had a big disagreement and I snapped said a lot of things that wasn't supposed to be said and she left.
I can't find her she changed her number she totally disappeared I tried to move on but I couldn't I still love her after more than a year of her leaving I still in love with her I still have hope that one day she will call again. I tried to stick myself in another relationships but I end up leaving because I can't I just can't think of any other girl. I got diagnosed by severe depression and on tons of medications and antidepressants but they seem that they aren't working anymore.
Hope she comes back again..."

"I was walking home and I saw something bounce off the main road and onto the pavement. I didn’t take notice of it until I got closer and saw that it was a very small bird. 

It was lying on its side and maybe looked like it had broken it’s neck I’m not sure. I didn’t want to leave it on the road so I picked it up and was supporting it’s head with my finger. I wasn’t exactly sure on what to do with it. The RPSCA in my area was shut, I’ve just looked online and there was some numbers I could’ve called at the time but I didn’t look hard enough.  

While I was walking the bird jumped from my hands and into a bush, I thought maybe it was okay since it did that, i watched it for a bit , but then it rolled over onto its side and it’s body and head ended up in the same position as how I found it. I didn’t want to leave it there so I picked it up again and started walking with it. Then all of a sudden it’s body started twitch, it’s eyes closed and it’s body went completely limp and I realised what happened. 

I felt horrible, I had tried to help but maybe I had made it worse by picking it up. I’m not an expert on birds but I maybe it was injured more than what I thought. I felt like crying, I placed it under a tree and walked home but I can’t stop thinking about the bird. How it ended up the roadside to how it passed it must of been in a lot of pain and I hope it’s okay now. Never experienced an animal death before, I had no emotional attachment to the bird so I’m unsure why I feel so crappy but I just needed to get this off my chest."

You showed great compassion to a defenseless animal and because of you, it didn't die alone. There was nothing you could have done to save it, but there's comfort in passing in the arms of a caring person versus the middle of the pavement.

How can I get rid of feelings of being numb? I dont really think I am 'depressed' as I still want to do things I enjoy on occasion but not nearly as much as I used to. I cry almost every day lately. I feel like I am a disappointment in life. I used to self injure, and I had a long streak that I was clean for, but not recently. I'm just so disappointed in myself, I dont know why others wouldnt be either. ☹️😔 Hope i'm not alone in this. I cant ever seem to find a friend to talk to either. I always seem to be the one who wants to vent and talk about my issues, but I'd like to hear what others are going through sometimes too that way I dont feel like its just me all the time, and maybe like i'm crazy or something.

i'm suicidal and yesterday i talked to my therapist about it. i accidentally said too much and she made me tell my parents. the three of them all were talking and said that i have to be under 24/7 supervision. i have to sleep in the same room as my parents and can't be alone for longer than to use the bathroom. they are baby proofing my fucking house. if i don't put up with this, they are gonna admit me to a hospital and i will have to be in inpatient care for a week or so. this fucking sucks, my independence is gone	SunnySideUp2711	post	32.846948637242	female	White	0.9994731545448303	na	na	na	8	sad	failed

Your independence is not gone, just put on hold. Your safety and wellbeing is the utmost priority of your parents and doctors. They are just doing what they can to make sure you don't hurt yourself. My daughter went through something very similar. I told her to look at the experience as an opportunity for a new beginning. I truly hope you can do the same.

what would be the quickest (preferably painless, but I know that is most likely not possible) way for me to kill myself. I'm looking at doing this on Monday night, so I got a fair amount of time to think of shit. Like I know stabbing yourself could work, but it's kinda freaky thinking bout that (I also get kinda queasy around blood), but I could do it if I have no other options.

"Hi, everyone!

You know, i thought this feeling of sadness can be attributed to combination of things like unhealthy lifestyle, self-pity and maybe not getting enough sunlight and etc. And that you can get out of this state of mind by just sucking it up, making myself think that other people are going through tougher situations, hitting the gym and shit.    

However I know now that it is more complex than that. I think I fell in love with a girl. I am feeling something new that I never felt before or maybe felt it but not as intense. I think about her all the time, replaying the 30 minute conversation I had with her. I can imagine her mannerisms, body language, and can hear her voice as it is happening in real life at this moment. I can’t get her out of my head.     

This is not the sad part though. The sad part is that she is 5 hours away. I did not ask her social media, because I was in the moment and lost myself in that feeling of Love and admiration. I found her Instagram, but I can’t request to be her friend, because I am afraid she will think that I sought her out. We don’t have mutual friends, so it will not fill natural.   

I lost all the joy in my life, like it just evaporated. I used to enjoy watching movies and making music and etc. But nothing feels important anymore, like everything I am doing is meaningless without that person in my life. Incredibly sad feeling."

"What's the point in waking up every day to an empty house and an empty inbox? Aging into middle age as a completely invisible nobody, infinitesimally insignificant and forgotten about by everyone?

Tasks fulfilled each day, but for what? For who? Where is any of this going, when every day is another day alone?

I haven't heard from anyone I used to know in years. I stopped exerting the effort; no one exerted the effort to remain connected in return.

How does one reconcile *being* an unessential? Someone who no one checks in on and no one contacts, for any reason? Pointlessly existent, alive because the body hasn't died yet?

How do you open up to strangers about *years* of being alone? How in any way do you make light conversation about that to new people?"	Dry-Calligrapher5271	post	38.300661592152125	female	White	0.9985185265541077	na	na	na	4	sad	failed

"I'm a 30 year old male living in a very good country (great social systems, generally speaking helpful people), so it isn't an issue of direct circumstance, I want to start with that to be completely transparent with this post.

The problem is I have absolutely no will or desire to get my life together.

I dropped out of high school about halfway through a long time ago, since then several attempts have been made to try and get the education again, but they have pretty much all been massive wastes of my mother's money.

So I don't have an education, I don't have a job, and have had pretty much just the one in my entire life so far like 10 years ago.

My parents have been divorced for slightly longer than that, my father has since then become completely estranged, the only things I know him are things my mother tells him about how he still manages to be a negative influence in her life with certain things he does.

Of course, I still live and leech off my mother, who is an extremely intelligent person, has a good job, but has been forced to take care of her useless son for far too long, there was a long period where she used to get upset, and we would argue, yelling at each other, over me getting a job and getting educated, but since then my mother gotten older, more tired, she doesn't even really have it in her anymore to do that, all our interactions now are calm, but it's not like I don't see the tragedy in that.

She loves me greatly, let there be no confusion about that, and I know she does, she has said many times everything she does is for her children (I also have a sister, who is progressing just fine in life, significantly above average even I would say), but she is getting older, and I've gotten nowhere closer to a position where I would be the one taking care after her, if it wasn't for the way I've lived my life so far, she would have saved up a lot of money by now, and could've retired long ago and done whatever she wanted.

Instead I robbed my mother of a LOT of money, not as in I literally took it from her, but because she had to maintain a house in a different country and spend on a lot of other stuff, she is literally left with barely anything to show for the great work she has done.

I don't drink or do drugs, and have never drank or done any drugs, as far as saving graces go, that's my only one, but it really is the only one, unless you count having a handful of good friends who I have a good relationship with as another saving grace, but all of them are leading family lives now, so it's not like I can really spend a lot of time with them.

Apart from that, there's nothing, I can't imagine getting a job, I have no qualifications for it whatsoever, the only jobs I am theoretically qualified for are the absolute bluest of blue collar jobs, and while I realize that that's the job I should be doing then, I don't want to.

I don't want to be a garbageman, I don't want to work at a supermarket, I don't want to lay brick.

I'm not unintelligent, I'm not particularly intelligent either, at best somewhat above, I've had some good moments in my life, where I've been moderately proud of myself, but even more time I have spent looking at other people and all the amazing things they do, not even just the top of the top, I just mean other above average people, and how much amazing things they create, and realized I will never come anywhere near to them, despite desperate wishing that I would.

I wish I had something I was good at, something I willed myself in getting skilled at, but I lack that will, there's no force pushing me to do something, no inner voice that wants to get things done, I love video games (speak of a big twist surprise that everyone saw coming), and I wanted to do something in that scene, but, I am 30 now, I have no education, no job, my mother is beginning to become more tired by the day, and I don't have any willpower to pick my life up despite being aware of all this.

The fact of the matter is, if I was meant to be working in something ""not blue collar"", I would've been working toward it by now, that's the progress of every single person's life who is passionate about something, they do SOMETHING towards it, maybe they have some channel reviewing games, or they have worked on making their own small games, maybe they've done small voice acting here and there, maybe this, maybe that, mingled in the community one way or another.

I really have nothing of that, I've played videogames, there were some communities I was part of because I was into the esport, but nothing that you could put on a resume or have someone notice one way or another and go 'oh shit this guy's legit let's work with him.

No, I have literally absolutely nothing, I have contributed nothing relevant to society.

There's no ins for me into the life I supposedly want.

I don't see myself picking up my education, I've already tried literally like several times, and the one thing I have a pretty decent speedrun timing in, is speedrunning to quitting attempts at getting an education, and of course, I've done plenty of lying about it towards my mother, who was really hoping I'd finish it, only to be disappointed over, and over, and over and over again, every time through a big midseason revelation that no, I have not in fact been doing literally ANYTHING at all towards it.

At some point I completely gave up, and stopped lying about any of it, and just straight up said I have no intention of getting an education, I am not capable of getting one, and have no real will of doing a shitty job.

I am not going to go into my childhood, I'll just summarize it with being utterly traumatic and leaving me with a significant amount of core memories, and almost all of them depressing.

The circumstances of my life have succeeded in completely overboiling this potato of a human, there's no consistency to me anymore, just a bunch of mashed human with no discernible structure.

I am left with no will to do anything, no inspiration, no real joys, I have completely and utterly forgotten what it is to love or be loved, despite the fact that my mother has nothing but genuine love for me, I used to have a girlfriend very long ago, but they relationship fell apart for all the right reasons, my ex had made the right choice, it was a painful breakup and one that despite feeling like I got over it, I unfortunately do not believe I truly did, which is just sad because it's a young adolescent relationship I'm still lamenting as a 30 year old 'man'.

I am of course overweight because I don't get out of the house basically at all, apart from sometimes visiting my friends, seeing the movies, stuff like that, but rarely.

My room is an utter sty, several times I have cleaned it up, till it was completely nice and free of any garbage, and every time, despite setting rules and checkpoints for making sure it wouldn't turn into garbage again, it inevitably always deteriorated right back, I remember the last time I completely cleaned it up, I would vocalize to myself every time I'd leave some wrapper, or packing box out or anything at all, telling myself that no no no I absolutely cannot allow myself to let stuff lie around or it'll just go back to what it was, and I kept that up for some period of time, but yeah, still failed.

As far as personal pleasures I partake in, you can pretty much expect what I do sometimes once, sometimes several times a day if I get bored, as to be expected, still thought I'd casually mention it to make sure I don't miss any details.

I bite my nails, I've been biting my nails ever since I was a little kid, my dad made many efforts to stop me from doing it, I have attempted and partially succeeded several times to stop doing it, I've had this whole idea of that even if I fail, I shouldn't see it as failure, but as succeeding to reach a new record for keeping my nails intact, didn't matter, a change in perspective didn't end up meaning much, and I went back to biting my nails, even after a decently long period of success.

I really want to have (at least a little bit more) good friends, but on this aspect I am afraid I am a little bit elitist, I cannot be friends with anyone who isn't at least a little bit more intelligent than I am, it's always been an important aspect in how I choose my friends, if there isn't at least something I consider the other person to be better than me in (that I also enjoy), I become naturally disinterested in maintaining a friendship, it's not like I disrespect the person or think I'm better than them or have some high ground over them, it's just how I end up naturally reacting.

I really would love to meet a person who has a similar kind of mindstate as me with a similar personality, someone who on the one hand isn't completely passionateless about life, who has interests and certain goals they'd wish they could achieve, but on the other hand simply lacks willpower to do it, for whatever reason, and they also have to be a generally loving person, I harbor no ill thought towards anyone ever, being jobless gives a person a lot of time to think and come up with life philosophies, my time spent thinking made me realize a way of looking at the world that completely abolishes any kind of deep rooted dislike I could have for anyone, I simply cannot hate anybody anymore, because the way I look at things it simply doesn't make any logical sense to do so.

If you're catching on you'll realize I am best defined by the label 'determinist' as a result, and instead of having any kind of vices towards people, it is always replaced with the curiosity of understanding what makes any given person one way or the other, and any frustration I could have with someone is usually due to not being able to understand entirely how someone didn't end up as a better kind of person, and a frustration with how much of a disservice someone is doing to themselves by not realizing they could be better.

Anyway, the problem is, there probably are people like that, it's just that they are usually part of more intelligent, more educated circles, and because I don't have an education and don't have a job, I have no chance of meeting a person like that, all my friendships are with people who I met when I was still in school, except like, one friendship that I made online a while ago, although that one gets a little dubious at times but that's another story.

So as a result I cannot make new friends, and it's not like I am upset with the world or depressed because of it, cause it makes sense, I am not explicitly lamenting not being able to make friends - of course I can't, I haven't put myself in a position where that is possible, and I am completely aware of what I'd have to do to get there.

Theoretically yes, I would have to bite the bullet and get a blue collar job, in a year I could probably rent some small apartment and pay for my own education (like I mentioned at the start, the country has great social systems, and my expenditures are pretty low, since I don't smoke, do drugs or drink alcohol, I buy a videogame for what is usually like a couple bucks then play that for like a month, sometimes longer), which would free up my mother to enjoy her life, then after 4 years I could complete the education and do something more interesting than the blue collar job, and start meeting the kind of people I'd like to be my friends.

The reality is that to get there, I cannot be taking shortcuts, I want an understanding kind and intelligent friend now, someone I can share my life with, someone to grow alongside with, but those kind of people aren't naturally attracted to people who haven't gotten their shit in order, it happens in cartoons, in anime and movies, but in real life an intelligent kind person will be surrounded by other intelligent kind people, and won't have any reason to have a no education, jobless hack to even enter their field of vision, and I wanna mention, I've never had any confusion about this, I've always had a very firm grip on the reality of how things work, it's one of the few 'saving graces' I have, a somewhat sober grip on reality, which a lot of people that are close to my kind of situation often appear to not have.

Blaming my childhood won't change anything, blaming the things that inevitably made me the way I am now won't change anything, being a sad sack about it isn't gonna change anything, but unfortunately what also doesn't change, is that I objectively, strictly speaking, despite having ALL this """"""awareness"""""", do not feel even the tiniest inkling of will or desire to do anything about it.

And I mean ANYTHING, the furthest limit I have gone to make any change in the recent years is googling a site with jobs on it, scroll on it a little bit, fantasize about how it'd be to apply to some of them, and then soon forget about it, and go back to old habits.

And to finally mention the poor screaming elephant in the room, on the topic of suicide, it's a whole other beast, on one hand I do glamourize the idea in my mind of just not being around anymore, but it will never ever be suicide, as I've mentioned before, I have some amount of awareness, including emotional awareness, of what kind of incredible damage that kind of action would do, and I simply do not have the right to inflict that kind of damage, as much as I wish I lived in a world where it was okay to just be allowed to quit, that's not the world I live in, the world I live in would be left with a traumatized mother and sister, who would forever have to bear the memory of a close family member lost in the most unfortunate of ways, and I have to mention, our family is exceptionally small, I have no uncles, no aunts, no grandparents (anymore), there is nobody in this family except me, my sister, my mother and estranged father.

So yeah, suicide and any other form of it is permanently out of the question, I have of course had the thought circulating in my head that perhaps the damage that would be done by doing it would be smaller than the accumulated damage of me being alive and causing so much discomfort and trouble by being an utter leech, but, and this is one aspect where my ""awareness"" is not doing me any favors, cause I had to *assume* that that isn't the case, rather than knowing it for certain, but the result is the same and I won't ever consider that 'out' as an option.

The fantasy of someone handing me a button that just permanently erases me from ever having existed that I instantly press without a second thought has been a comforting one to spin around on some sad nights though.

Another thing is that I don't even necessarily feel what would be considered clinically depressed, there's lots of things I enjoy, there's series that I love watching and talking about, especially well written ones, I genuinely love video games as I've mentioned before, I do feel the urge to get out of bed eventually, and can easily control my sleeping schedule when I feel like it, it's not that hard for me to decide to wake up at 7 and go to sleep at 12 or 11, the only reason I sometimes don't feel like playing or watching anything, is because I feel the incredible weight of just being completely and utterly behind in life.

And to once again tie the bow on this, having said all that about still having certain passions and interests, having at least some will to live, despite all that, I have absolutely no will whatsoever to make any kind of change, I am not announcing it as something I'm proud of or anything like that, I simply am stating a fact of exactly how I feel.

If I was going to change, I would've already started, but at this rate, it feels like the only change will occur when something will completely alter the status quo of my life, I mean, my mother won't be able to keep working forever, someday that will end, and it's really sad that I'm mentioning that as the only real scenario I expect I will force myself, or to be entirely specific, be forced to change.

I remember very long ago I posted a sort of similar thread to this on another website, 4chan, one that I've stopped going to a long time ago as well because the vibe didn't work for me anymore, and I remember one of the responses was this classic hardass response that would lay out the reality to me, like a in a very tough love sort of way, which was of course right on all points, but even then it still felt hopeless, I knew that nothing was going to change.

In the end, there's a bell curve of people and the degree to what kind of interesting lives they lead, but just like there is some amount of people who will be at one end, leading great lives, and enjoying themselves immensely, a large amount of people in the middle who are leading just fine lives, and generally having an okay time, someone is bound to be at the beginning of that curve, and lead a miserable life, it is inevitable.

So I can't really be upset with that fate either, it just has to be this way.

Of course I'm writing this out of the comfort of a home I don't pay for, with lots of food every day, not lifting a finger to change my life while there are people out there who work throughout the entire day starting from a very young age to be able to afford a fraction of the comforts I have, often having to support an entire family, but despite having that perspective, and knowing that I am way better off than a lot of people who dream of being in my position, it just isn't doing anything in regards to actually pushing me to do anything, it isn't igniting any sparks, isn't triggering any kind of active response.

Which can only really lead to one conclusion, I simply am an evil, manipulative human being, who is trying their hardest to not admit to themselves they are evil, since when you are aware of every single thing that is happening to you and what needs to be done to make it better, but you actively don't do it, that can only be explained with maliciousness.

Despite everything that I just wrote though, I did actually in many ways come to terms with my situation, which is probably not how a doctored therapist or, you know, any average sane person would describe this, but, I used to have some anxiety about failing slightly more than a decade ago, but then once I actually failed big time, I had to come to terms with it, and then I became really good at coming to terms with failing, and eventually had accepted my fate, I used to envy people who were really good at something, ""if only I was that good at literally anything"" I'd think to myself, but that's not what my life was meant to be, it only feels unlucky because I'm the one experiencing my life, but I'm just one small entity in a massive sea of other entities, the universe doesn't pick favourites, the universe doesn't care, things just happen, things just are, and I just am this, and they just are that.

Still very sad for my mom though, with everything she has done, everything she's gone through, the changes she made to herself, the circumstances she has escaped, the pureness, kindness and selflessness she has shown all her life, I think she has probably experienced some of the most undeserving consequences ever.

Although I could argue that having a kid in your very early twenties while still studying at a university while being in a relationship that definitely isn't faultless is a very bad move, and I should never have even existed, so in a way I could rationalize the consequences as being something that should be a pretty expected result.

My mother maintains though that I am the most important thing about her life, together with my sister, and nothing else matters, but, I remain adamant that I am truly a mistake, I know she genuinely doesn't feel that way, and I know she never will, but I would never even consider having a kid with a person before having a settled life and confident that I can fully rely on the trust and love from my partner, and trust my own sanity as well while raising my child, while we're at it.

But hey, I said I wasn't going to go into my childhood traumas, there's a LOT to unpack there, but I've already unpacked and repacked it so often myself, I have no will to do that again either, at least not here, and not now."

"Same boat. I really want a job though. I had a pretty good education, great high school grades and a degree, but never had a job. 

99% of people have to start working at the bottom even with the best education. Something like a customer service jobs shows you can work with people, hold down a job, work hard, etc. Unless you study to become a doctor or something, you usually have to start with a minimum wage job and then try to climb the ladder. You will earn more money and get better jobs as you work, if your lucky/ proactive then it happens every year but otherwise after years of work you’ll still progress.

You clearly want your life to be better, but you say you have no desire to try make it happen. Why? If your life is so uncomfortable then why don’t you want to change it? I want to change it just crippled by a fear of confrontation and the bullshit way people behave. 

This reminds me of a [short film](https://youtu.be/RUaOpH31IRU) which I really relate to, especially when it’s like “you wish your life could change, but you do nothing to make that actually happen.” 

Still there will be a reason behind why you’re ‘comfortable’ with being uncomfortable, maybe it’s fear or just too beaten down by life to have the energy. But you can still work on it. It’s definitely not too late to go to university either."	PleaseFixCamera	reply	na	na	na	0.9975590705871582	no	strong	no	na	sad	no prediction.

"It's funny, from where I am sitting, the feeling I can best describe feeling when reading your situation is 'second-hand relief'.

You have everything you need to start building up your life, all you need to do is realize that you have nothing to fear from people who would behave in a 'bullshit' way, they deserve not your fear or anticipation of confrontation, but contempt, if they act in a weird way that would put a person like you who is just looking for a job in a bad mood, that's literally THEIR problem, not yours, the average person fully understands and respects the hustle of having to get a job, even if you get rejected because perhaps you didn't fit their needs, any normal person would still be wishing you to succeed, because a person in a good state of mind gets great joy from seeing others succeed.

So respect yourself and never pay half a mind to people who would try and take you down a peg, again, it's their problem, and says absolutely zip about you, just a fella tryin to get a job.

I really hope you will understand that soon and get it done, I am happy you shared it with me, I am certain you'll come out on top, you've got what you need for it, and I think any therapist worth their salt would be able to articulate this even better to you.

As for me, I'm 'comfortable' because my direct current circumstances are strictly speaking, well, *comfortable* now, I live in a warm house and eat good food each day, but of course, it is on borrowed time and I'm exploiting a person undeserving of such treatment.

These things are usually enough to cause discomfort to people, like if they depend on their parents, there's many success stories where people tell how they just wanted to go out of the house, make their own life, and not leech off their parents anymore.

I don't feel that, I am aware of what I'm doing to my mom, I love my mom, I know she loves me, I know it is unfair, but there is nothing in me that is agitating me to change it, there just isn't, I should feel something, some force that anxiously pushes me towards changing up my circumstances, to set things right for my mom, but it simply isn't there.

I just don't feel anything, except a constant sense of passive disappointment in myself and lots of wishful thinking.

And despite that, again, I don't actually feel what would usually be considered clinical depression, because there are actually aspects of life I enjoy, I don't feel like lying in bed all day, I don't hate the idea of living, I just wish certain circumstances of my life had been different, so that I was in a different place at this point in my life, and the idea that I'd have to invest like 5 years minimum while being 30 before actually being able to start building my life is abhorrently dreadful."

Lots of people get degrees at 30, there are loads of options. The difficult part is paying to go but if you can get funding or afford it then you should. Your life won’t change much whether you’re studying or not. It’s just hard work but you seem interested in education and tbh some degrees are much easier than others. I know it’s not the same as going straight after school, but at the very least you could just enjoy it and learn something interesting whether you build a life or not.

Is he using divorce as a threat? Or just talking about it? Depending on your situation you should have an honest chat and say it upsets you when he brings it up and you don’t want him to do it anymore. Sadly if things aren’t working  in marriage then the best thing to do is end things on good terms and try to arrange life in a way that benefits everyone, or it will just get worse and have the same outcome.

"I just lost someone that I feel in love with and that person didn't want me as much as I wanted her if someone walks away from u let them it's going to hurt but you can't focus someone to stay if they love you they will come back 
Sorry your going though this if you need to talk just text I don't really sleep"	Patpie42O	reply	na	na	na	0.9994481205940247	strong	strong	no	na	sad	failed
My thought is that your children are learning the wrong way of how marriage should be. I would think about them. If he's not treating you right and doesn't want to change his ways, then I would seek counseling for yourself and determine what you should do. I did that many years ago and don't regret it. Let me know if you need for someone to listen. You can always DM me.	Patpie42O	reply	na	na	na	0.9994481205940247	no	strong	no	na	sad	failed
That's exactly the way I'd like I don't want any of this I'm completely confused. But I have good hope I will just try to talk to him.	Patpie42O	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9994481205940247	no	no	no	na	sad	failed

"Don’t have much family other then my wife and 2 kids. I have 1 childhood friend who I rarely talk to. 

My thoughts are bringing me down today. Always feel like I’m a big screw up and can’t seem to do anything right or please anyone. 
 
I have no motivation and I just want to sleep."	Datmuny19	post	30.416285379760897	male	White	0.9994661211967468	na	na	na	6	sad	failed
