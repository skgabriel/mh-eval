"folks, your feedback made me cry. I wish we did not need a tool like vortle, but i am so glad its helping

A few reminders:

* relax your shoulders from time to time
* unclench your jaw
* stretch / move if you can

also, to play games you need to tap on T or diamond, play button loads relax/meditate/sleep mode

"Hello Bulky, 

first of all, I really love Vortle and think you did a freaktastic job there. I've come to enjoy especially the breathing exercise and I've always loved to play Tetris. 

Question: Is there a possibility you could make the blue shadow tool of the dropping stone in Tetris optional? 

I'm asking because my brain specifically is very good at imagining and working with structures (which is why I love Tetris xD) , so figuring out where the actual yellow dropping stone is supposed to go is enjoyable but having the blue shadow as a help tool is very distracting for me and gives me stress that contradicts the good feeling of ""oh yes, let me figure it out - I got it!!!"" 

I can see the shadow being super helpful for others, but for me it's a hinderance, so is it maybe possible to add a cancel function?

I know it's a very me-specific request, I would totally understand if it's too much to ask. Thank you a lot for developing Vortle in the first place. :)"	Bulky_Highlight_3352	reply	na	na	na	0.9354169964790344	weak	no	strong	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"A few things that make Vortle different from other games:

* several spatial problem games, and a breathing exercise game
* no music, just soothing ambient sounds
* very little motion, slight animation to make the world lively
* as sensory-friendly as possible. I am autistic and it was a must for me. 
* games do not keep score, it is about relaxation and grounding
* no need to sign-in, login, register or answer any crappy surveys - install and play instantly
* The games are based on research published on the effects of games on PTSD survivors, so the choice of games is not random. 
* Vortle doesn't collect any data but uses artificial intelligence (AI) right on the device ( I am an AI scientist by day) to adjust gameplay with a focus on feeling safe and calm. 
* The app is language agnostic, no need to read a wall of text to enjoy it."	Bulky_Highlight_3352	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9354169964790344	no	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"Update:

I have now used Vortle to distract me in my dentists office.

I have generally good teeth and little reason to worry but I still end up feeling a little tense every time I go, due to an unpleasant experience as a kid (loss of control and pain, you get the idea). 

Sitting and waiting for my appointment was formerly spent scrolling social media. This time I tried to distract myself with Vortle. What can I say- it's great to have the breathing exercise to relax to before I even feel tension and focussing on Tetris afterwards made me feel pretty coolheaded when my name was called (opposed to social media scrolling which never really helped, but what else can you do there?)

I went for a general check and everything was fine, so no time to try Vortle as a distraction during any work being done, but just having the potential option was soothing.

"This is a bit of a vent done in the hopes of organizing my frustrations with my healing process.This October, it'll be three years since I began to realize objectively and unpack the fact that I was groomed and preyed upon as a minor by several people that I considered friends, and that these people used me to sexual ends, and that these things have had a pretty major impact upon my life. 

This October will also, in turn, mark two years since I began to slowly work through this in a therapeutic framework.

There has been growth. There had been a time where I had not been able to see this, but there has been growth. I have had my trauma validated as trauma - that this was traumatic and destabilizing, both what happened and my realization; I've been diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, with much of it concerning questions of ethics and morality - in large part based around the fears I've received from the abuse that has happened; and I've been making progress in establishing boundaries, realizing what I am and am not comfortable with, and how much I had left unevaluated.

This year, I've made progress not only in seeing my abusers in a different light, but also me, too. I've recognized - not only rationally, but have started to realize internally - that I was used, and that what happened to me wasn't my fault. What's more, I've become more comfortable with the fact that I don't want to be sexualized or intimate. I'm not somebody's plaything, and I'm not a piece of meat, and I don't have to be for people to like me. I don't have to bend to every whim out of fear anymore.

At the same time, I'm scared - very scared - that I've become a significantly worse person in my healing process.

In trying to establish boundaries‚Äî particularly as regards intimacy, only to find them crossed or disregarded, I feel I've become resentful. In trying to work hard on myself and seeing how other people in my life are complacent in apparently letting the cycles continue, I've become very bitter. I broke up with my partner in December because I felt like these boundaries were being ignored, and I regret it daily - not because I don't feel as if my boundaries were being ignored, I feel like they were, but I could've tolerated that instead of hurting them.

I've found myself withdrawing a lot - quite by accident, in many cases, whether by losing a password to a social media account I can't reset, or something similar; but I'm terrified of reaching out to the friends I've lost contact with.

I'm scared I've not only become a significantly worse person, but I feel like I've exposed myself for the fraud I've always have been. I feel like a genuine fake and mistake. In trying to claw my way back from all this, and learning how to say no, I'm scared I've become a very harmful presence, and that people are recognizing me for the burden I always have been. I have so many friends I want to reach out to‚Äî but I'm afraid they'd reject me, and even more that they'd be right in doing so. I can't see myself as anything else but a burden‚Äî someone who has consistently brought others down. People have told me I've been a good friend to them, but that seems like it could only be a passing fiction, and one that's certainly passed now in light of the fact that I've grown so cold and withdrawn. If I could even make the attempt of being a good friend again, I'm scared that I'd wind up being an absolute fraud like the rest of me‚Äî a bitter, arrogant hypocrite who can't live up to my values, with a chip on my shoulder because people hurt me by not living up to theirs. I want to reach out to the friends I've drifted away from so, so badly, but I feel like they'd be more burdened by my presence than anything else.

I thought I was doing better. I thought I was doing the right thing by learning to say no. I just feel as if I've become a rampantly selfish blowhard. I'll have friends tell me that I'm doing so good, that I'm doing well at healing, at growing, at making progress‚Äî but I'm not sure I could possibly make up for having been such a waste of space for so long, only to immediately lose the plot as I've begun to heal. Even the friends that have been patient with me and I have the privilege of remaining in contact with, I'm so scared that I'll lose them‚Äî that I'm pushing them away.

I feel as if everyone would be immeasurably better without me in their lives, and not only this, but if I had never been in their lives to begin with. There'd be no heartbreak from me, no confusion, no hurt, no silences‚Äî and that seems as if it'd be preferable to the burden I've become.

I cannot stop now; I have to keep going, and keep growing. But I cannot help but wonder what I've gained. To be sure, I've healed some; but these mornings, afraid and cowering and mad and sick of myself, still come, too‚Äî and the reality that I've never been profitable or of any edification to anyone seems crystal clear to me. I've been nothing but a burden, and that of which I am most afraid: toxic, mean, bitter, arrogant, narcissistic, hypocritical, self-centered. I must grow, and I must heal; but I feel so tempted to stay away for good. I don't want to be a burdensome presence to anyone ever again."	throwawayimprove	post	23.363133246344674	female	White	0.988038957118988	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

Last year on winter break I used to smoke a lot of weed I was 13 at the time and I believed it caused me to either have severe withdrawal or a traumatic brain injury, since then it has left me traumatized, I‚Äôll try to keep this a short story but the first 3 days of winter break going without weed I started throwing up and had a severe headache and cold. It was like this until the second week where my hearing started going away and fluid started leaking out of my ears the headache at this point was the worst pain imaginable, it was so bad that I started blacking out 3-4 times a day, the third week I was placed on an IV and couldn‚Äôt even walk so they wheeled me in on a wheelchair, they placed an IV in my hand and I blacked out after a few minutes, after I woke up I could sort of walk because they had nutrients in the IV that‚Äôs when I noticed I haven‚Äôt eaten anything these whole 3 weeks, I got home and went to bed, after I woke up the pain was way much worse and I could still walk but barely and had to take breaks literally every ten second to get my strength back, it was the middle of the night that I woke up and I went to bed around 1-2am  the night before, I don‚Äôt remember what time it was when I woke up, I still couldn‚Äôt hear and at this point couldn‚Äôt feel or smell, the only thing I can feel is the intense pain in my head, at this point I remembered I haven‚Äôt eaten again and got the worst feeling of hunger ever, I got up and stumbled to the kitchen, then my vision started fading away but not normally like going blind, i had tunnel vision and saw purple and blue shards of glass that almost covered my entire vision, it looked like I was on pshycadelics. I finally made it to the kitchen and grabbed a can of tuna, then I saw something in the doorway, it was a complete black figure with smoke around its knees and lower legs, I was so hungry and in too much pain to feel fear or to even react, at this point everything was In stop motion I knew I was dying, at one point I open the can of tuna and next it was in the bowl that was the last thing I remember from that night, after that I wasn‚Äôt dying of starvation and was just left with a fever. What I think happened is my body was so used to being high that my Brian couldn‚Äôt handle it and I suffered from a traumatic brain injury, does anyone know what actually happened?	oakly_420-_	post	23.74438167094762	male	White	0.992422878742218	na	na	na	5	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

You got an iv so you saw some doctor. What did they say was going on? You can indeed be traumatized by a medical experience however weed nor withdrawal can cause fluid to leak from the ears etc. purely coincidental that you became ill after cessation.

It sounds like you had a virus. Or you had not eaten or drank anything and contracted a virus or bacterial infection. Nothing to do with weed. You can reach back out to the doctor that provided care to ask what they believe the problem was. If you think you had a brain injury from something other than weed such as a fall or car accident the doctor that cared for you can provide clarity. If you have psychological trauma from this experience I suggest you see a therapist. Again smoking weed and stopping smoking weed cannot cause traumatic brain injury.

"Hello everyone,
I hope this is the right place for me to ask about some things that recently have left me absolutely shook to my core and giving me such a horrible feeling in my stomach. Where do I begin? I guess I will explain my childhood life a bit and then explain the situation that has left me in a traumatic state.

Growing up I had a wonderful childhood, very loving and caring parents and family members, and grew up to respect and treat others how you would want to be treated. I have a big heart and I am very caring. Always have been. 

I am 25 years old now (m) and have a best friend that I've known since I was a child . We were really tight and close, but the last few years as you get older you drift apart and go on to new things. We still try to get together every now and then when we both have time off work or if their is a concert or music event going on. 

In January we both thought it would be a good idea to go see a concert going on in our town and  I planned to stay over since i live in a different city and he had no problems with me staying over. We  head to the concert have a good time and have some drinks , until he said something that really really freaked me out and shook me to the core, he was much more intoxicated than I was mind you but he had to go to the bathroom in the event center and I was waiting for him, when he came out of the bathroom he kind of said to me and pointed ""this guy's getting raped tonight!"" And another person passed by when he said that and looked at me strange and I had a pit in my stomach once he said that as well. I could not tell if he was joking or not. 


He has always said he is straight not gay but he has not had a girlfriend in easily 12 years or has had any motivation to get a girlfriend which is why I felt very uneasy when he said that to me. 

We go back to his apt at the end of the music event and then get some food and after that I fell asleep on his spare bed he keeps in his living room , while I passed out there I remember him still sitting in the chair watching TV as I passed out. Not a big deal or anything at the time but when I woke up that next day he said to me "" you looked like you were having a great sleep and talking in your sleep too"" I woke up that morning feeling kind of creeped out and like something happend but I have no proof. 

I go over to his apt to hangout another time and have drinks and we are playing video games, and I was the first one to go to sleep again, but once I woke up that morning I had the biggest panic attack of my life. And it literally felt like someone punched my chest in. I NEVER get panic attacks and I just felt really scared and off.. my butt was sweaty as well and the morning after the music event it was kind of wet/sweaty as well too.

After all this a bunch of friends decided it would be a good to go to a 3 day camping music festival out in the woods which was this previous weekend. He was with us all as well. And the first night at this festival we all had a great time. I did not go to bed until 330-4am, but after going to bed I woke up later and felt really weird. The entire weekend all my friends were making butt jokes and ass raping jokes. Jokes about farting out cum and all this other stuff that was REALLY REALLY making me want to get sick to my stomach and freak out. So the other 2 nights of this festival i actually slept in my car with the doors locked to avoid anybody potentially doing anything to me. And the 3rd day of being there I broke out and started crying and freaking out like I never have ever in my life. I felt VIOLATED. And abused without my consent or knowledge.  They kept saying things while I went to my truck that morning like "" he knows dude"" and I told them that I am going to leave the festival because I don't feel right. They tried to convince me to stay and I did. But the last 2 nights I didn't get drunk and kept an eye on my drinks because I'm not sure if I was potentially roofed or not. But the last 2 nights the one friend I stayed at his apt with looked extremely angry and unhappy, like he was mad it wasn't working out the way he wanted. They also said some fucked up shit like be sure to wipe your phone, not talking to me but the buddy who I stayed at his apt with those 2 times. 

I don't believe I'm going crazy and I don't believe the jokes they have made are bringing up any past childhood truama, and when we were children I never felt like this before around him,

But now he's giving Me the creeps.


Are my thoughts valid? I'd appreciate some responses. I am sorry for the essay."

"I did not have a terrible childhood, far from the worst, but I do think it left me somewhat traumatized and with some maladaptive bonding systems. I come from a family that was distant, avoidant, angry, and where there was a lot of emotional neglect; emotional abuse was common, as well as infrequent, but highly unpredictable physical aggression occurred (I still struggle to admit or qualify it as physical abuse). Yet despite these things I was given everything I physically need  as a child and then some. I had secure living, food, clothing, supplies, there were times my parents could be quite loving,

As an adult I have become acutely aware that I am highly affected, stimulated, and even desire a very cat-mouse like relationship. I really enjoy and become intrigued with people who where I am  unable to guess what's next, unsure of where they stand, where I stand; where I have to work at getting their affection, show that I have value by their currency . I enjoy a degree of volatility within a relationship. When things are going as I want , I become so incredibly infatuated and attached to people who give me the adrenaline, dopamine surges, but of course crashes are intense and bring up so many old feelings of rejection, anxiety, fear, unworthiness, that their leaving, or hurtfulness was my own doing , that I'm at fault.

In my life I have had 3 boyfriends who are the exact opposite; the were kind, caring, understanding, they wanted a relationship with me , the offered security (I mean they were human, they had faults), but they were healthy. I gave them an opportunity not because I was highly attracted to them, but because they were offering something healthy, the kind of relationship that at my core I want- I want to be deeply loved. Unfortunately every time I feel unstimulated, bored, the constant availability of affection makes it seem less valuable, and my sexual desire is very low in these relationships.... the safety makes it feel so friendly once the initial excitement wears off.

How does one retrain, rewire a nervous system, adapt a biochemical system to long for and enjoy healthy relational bonds? How do I get my brain/body to want what is actually loving and not the rollercoaster that I have learned to find enjoyment in ?"	icometoredditforhelp	post	26.40901960336456	female	White	0.0048730927519500256	na	na	na	7	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"I highly relate with parts of what you shared. Thanks for having the courage to do that.

Having to rewire the cns would seem like a hard thing, but you own a supercomputer and are at least part, if not all ‚Äúlight magic energy‚Äù. If you don‚Äôt believe that just believe that others believe this, and they‚Äôre truly on to something.

My best way to articulate the method, I began by getting quiet (and baked), then I imagined my home life growing up, me being a wee one who couldn‚Äôt stop the violence. Couldn‚Äôt even entertain it to stop. I was a cute baby but not that cute, apparently. While visiting with me I felt the terror and disappointment, and I walked in like a real super hero and grabbed myself up and scolded them both. That didn‚Äôt seem like a big deal, but if you think of your mind as a touching machine - you can literally tell it to go to the places that hurt. My tummy hurts - okay bring my awareness to my stomach. By doing that, it brings the touch of your magic mind to bear. It will release the energy of you try this. 

So within the relationship and social aspects - the best way I know how to rewire is to be as kind as possible. No I mean like how I treat the world is as if I love each and every one. The ones who cause frustration, I avoid or find out why thru meditating. I‚Äôve also made conscious efforts to not scold myself, to not use bad names. For myself. Or others. I have a profane tongue so it only goes so far. Traffic and whatnot.

What I‚Äôd say to you as if you were my niece or something, I‚Äôd say you can go back and reassure your system. That nature and love and light can bring magic that we must believe in to receive.

"To preface, there might not be anything ""wrong"" with you and your trauma history could actually be what's convincing you that there is something. A hard pill to swallow is that ALL relationships end. One or both of you die, or you break up. And for most people, there are a lot of people that they'll click with and have a spark with, and who they genuinely love, but things fade out over time. A possibility you need to realize is that there may not be anything you could have done differently. You may just not have been compatible with 3 sweet dudes and that's ok.

First, I'd join r/CPTSD if you aren't already in it. Idk if you fit the bill exactly because I don't know you, but you might find stuff discussed there beneficial. I'm sure there are threads discussing wanting to work towards more stable and steady relationship dynamics.

Second, not to get NSFW ITT... But have you tried any reputable BDSM scenes or relationships? Because you could potentially have the best of both worlds. A sweet, loving relationship with phases of unpredictability and excitement through BDSM play. Some people even play with the dynamics of their relationship and not just sex.

Third, have you ever considered non-monogamy? As a way to play with new partners but still have an anchor partner you go home to and build your life with. It's by no means for everyone and you would need to put work in to get to a place where it would be manageable (communication and honesty about how you feel in the relationship is KEY), but it is a possibility.

Last, look up polyvagal theory. It's rooted in the idea that our nervous system is altered as a result of trauma. You may find some helpful tips. I would also recommend meditation and mindfulness, as a pathway to accept that things come and go. That includes the spark in a lot of relationships."	icometoredditforhelp	reply	na	na	na	0.0048730927519500256	no	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"There is a lot to unpack here, and much of it is actually stuff that I have thought about , considered , and begun to toy with . With my background , polyamory or non monogamy is difficult for me . I have a lot of stress surrounding rejection , not being wanted, and being compared or pitted up against people . 

Over the last month or two I tried this radical self acceptance thing . I went for the type of people who excite me , and invigorate my internal fire . It is amazing when it‚Äôs good , but the minute I voice unhappiness or frustration I get bowled over , ghosted , toyed with . Part of what worries me is that I think I‚Äôm ‚Äúwired‚Äù to like individuals who have the propensity to manipulate , be very reductive , or gaslight (I use that term sparingly because I think it‚Äôs highly overused). Me sharing my boundaries or feelings has been met with statements of being sensitive , difficult , argumentative, if I‚Äôm not immediately cut off or ghosted . 

Bdsm is something that I have started looking into . I had the exact thought of ‚Äúbest of both worlds ‚Äú. I think I have to look into it more , I bet there are some very respectful individuals who participate , but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if on that journey I run into some of what I‚Äôve found in normal life . That some manipulation and overstepping of personal boundaries may be done under the guise of ‚Äúbeing dominant‚Äù. 

I will check out the cPTSD community , even if just to look , as well as the polyvagal theory . I appreciate your input . I hope my response didn‚Äôt sound like I brushed off your suggestions . I do appreciate them . I have spent a lot of years trying to figure out how to remedy my predicament‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs led to a lot of ideas and thoughts , and experiences , but I still haven‚Äôt found a solution which can be really frustrating and sometimes really sad or hurtful .

Sometimes I think all that‚Äôs wrong with society is that people don‚Äôt make an effort to see each other‚Ä¶while also screaming inside to be seen. A poem by Rilke says why not be the love or whatever it is people are wanting. But if you‚Äôre easily manipulated and then you‚Äôre probably both empathetic as well as empathic. They both attract narcissists like flies. Best thing is to look for the value reciprocity. If ya aren‚Äôt getting what you‚Äôre giving, at some noticeable level - then that relationship friendship job whatever isn‚Äôt serving you.

So I was sexually assaulted back last year and I haven‚Äôt had any intimacy since meeting my now boyfriend of 3 months. We had sex about a month in. It was fine. Had sex again awhile later and he made a comment about me being dry and it triggered me so badly. I‚Äôm almost certain it‚Äôs because of my SA and the comments the guy that assaulted me did. We stopped having sex right there- I felt very uncomfortable and unsafe around my boyfriend for weeks. I still feel uncomfortable around him sometimes and I absolutely can‚Äôt do intimacy with him. Kissing, cuddling, sex, any of it just throws me into fight or flight with him now. It‚Äôs all I can associate him with when I think about trying to be intimate with him. How do i come back from this? I felt like I was making progress on my SA and recovering from it but I feel unsafe with my partner and I‚Äôm not sure what to do.

I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through this. the trauma can make intimacy feel very uncomfortable. I‚Äôm not sure how supportive ur bf is, but if you feel comfortable, talk to him about it. But you also don‚Äôt have to. No matter what he should respect you. Therapy would be best to help process your bodies trauma. Because trauma is mostly stored in the body. I am in the same boat except I can‚Äôt get past the first date with guys because if we kiss I get very uncomfortable and panic. I get thrown back into my trauma and now I have no interest in dating. Which sucks because I love falling in love. But the perpetrator stole that from me. But I am joining a support group in my town to help me process and meet others who are feeling the same. Just know you‚Äôre not alone and your feelings are valid. You have the right to not have sex until or if you‚Äôre ready. I hope you‚Äôre boyfriend is supportive.

Never said it was his problem or that he needed to be my therapist. I told him so he was aware of my experiences and past, not so that he could ‚Äúfix me‚Äù or have any answers.

"Projecting how so‚Ä¶? He made a comment that triggered trauma and we had a conversation about it. I never once pinned any of my issues onto him- I never told him it was HIS fault that I felt this way. I told him he made a comment that triggered feelings from my past, but that they aren‚Äôt directly about him. He understands my response and has given me the space to work through it in therapy appropriately. It‚Äôs because of my previous experiences, not anything directly from him. The core of the issue is my SA, not his comments. He‚Äôs been as understanding as he could be- this isn‚Äôt at all a post about him, this is about me getting past my own intimacy struggles, which I realized I would face eventually- whether it be him or another partner in the future. Can you explain where I‚Äôm projecting? Or making my issues his own? Because as far as I‚Äôve made this clear this is ME battling MY own issues and learning how to separate trauma responses from reality. 

I came here to ask for advice and see if others have struggled with this. Not to be berated with ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs not his problem‚Äù.

"Hi, I'm really sorry for my bad english, I'm not bilingual, but I'll do my best.

I'm 19 and I'm syrian (but I live in France since 2016), my childhood wasn't the most peacefull, but I remember **everything** about the worst and violent moments of my life, so I thought I never had any ""repressed"" trauma.

But since some months, I feel really sad and bad, and I know it's linked to my past : I have weird flashbacks of scenes that never happened and nightmares where I'm alone in places of my childhood (for exemple my old house in Aleppo or my elementary school), and I dont associate it to any bad memories. I feel very bad about it because I don't understand why I'm ""obsessed"" with this part of my life ? I wouldn't say I've healed from the traumas I know, but I'm managing them quite well, I'm pretty sure they don't the cause of my strange emotions. I feel bad about something else that happened in this moment of my life, but I don't know what.

So, I'm questionning why I feel like I'm blocked in the past when I'm **sure** I accepted it since years ? Why do I feel like I forgot something important, but I don't know what ? I'm pretty sure I remember everything, but my brain is saying ""No, you forgot something !!!"". I really forgot, or I am making memories ?

I can't see a therapist because it's expensive and I don't have enough money, I have to deal alone with everything, but I'm really exhausted because this feeling is there since month. 

 I'm sorry if what I'm saying isn't very clear, but I hope someone can help me"	ayafool	post	12.851305487042453	female	White	0.9924531579017639	na	na	na	2	traumatoolbox	ethnicity: syrian, age: 19, gender: unknown, explanation: the author self-identifies as syrian and notes their age as 19. however, they do not provide any information about their gender.

"Has there been any new stress in your life? Has there been any big change in your life? Since a few weeks or months before this started happening.

Post-traumatic flashbacks can be complicated. They are not always exactly a perfect replay of a memory. Your body gets confused, your mind gets confused, but they are still registering what is going on around you to some degree. This can be different in each scenario and for each person. It is possible you cannot remember something that did happen. It is also possible that there is nothing you cannot remember, but have a general sense of unease and confusion with these symptoms. Thinking that there must be something you cannot remember could be the explanation of this your mind is looking for.

"NSFW. This might end up being quite a long post. TW for mentions of sexual violence, illnesses and  self harm.

When I was 18 I was in a 3 month long relationship with this guy who was extremely mentally ill (depressed, self harming, very controlling and manipulative although I don't know to what extent he realised he was doing that stuff). It was a situation where we were in constant contact throughout the day (literally from the moment I woke up) and then often up talking so late that I would pass out in bed (which would sometimes make him upset/freak out if we were in the middle of an ""important conversation"" even though sometimes it would be like 4am). He hated my mum, who is also emotionally abusive and has been physical with me in the past, and she hated him even more so at home I was constantly hiding the relationship and lying about it to her. We never had sex but we did other things, and since he said that he had been raped by a girl at a party I felt like I could trust him to not do anything bad to me, and I guess he didn't but I often felt uneasy. I remember one time I was pretending to be asleep in bed with him because I was so emotionally exhausted that I just wanted some quiet, and he kissed me while I was ""asleep"" and just held his mouth there until I started kissing back which I didn't want to do. This felt off at the time obviously but I never brought it up because anything I brought up with him became a huge ordeal where he would get unbelievably upset, either at the moment or later on, and so it just felt like it wasn't worth it. There was also another time after we had split where we were sitting on a shipping container kind of thing and I felt like he was leaning over me, trying to press me backward into lying down. I can't remember if I actually did lie down or not though. This was my first ""proper"" relationship and it is the one I can remember the most from, I can barely rememeber any other past this point in my life.

This guy gave me mononucleosis which started developing I think right before we broke up, and because I was already so run down it caused my liver to start failing. I was off school for like 2 months and my overall grades suffered and my immune system tanked itself for the next two+ years. Him constantly contacting me and with input from my mum to just get rid of him made me text him to break up (because I literally could barely talk because my tonsils were turning black and rotting) and he called me and begged to speak with me so I just sat on the phone going ""mmhmm"" and he basically just scream-cried at me saying stuff like ""you didn't even bring this up with me though so how was I supposed to know."" Even after that we still stayed in contact on and off until early the next year, so the whole ordeal between meeting him, dating him, breaking up, getting sick and then cutting contract was about a year. I don't know why I couldn't stay away from him, it was so painful for my 18 year old self to be separated from him that I couldn't handle it I guess.

We didn't speak for like a year and then when I was 20 I reached out to him to apologise for my part in making the relationship bad and difficult. I specifically said that I didn't want to be friends or talk after that conversation but I guess we ended up talking more, like I probably should have just refused to speak to him or whatever but he kept trying to talk to me. And I have always felt weirdly tied to him and stuff so I just felt like maybe I should talk to him more I guess which I know was really bad. And so we ended up being in contact again for like a year and we spoke like every day which started to get really annoying. He told me he was self haring again with a pocket knife and I was like I'll take it from you if you want because I felt like that was what I was supposed to say, so he gave me this pocket knife the next time I saw him and I just threw it in a drawer somewhere. I eventually got super overwhelmed and didn't reply to him for a few days, where he did try to message me a couple of times throughout them. Then we started speaking again and I got kind of tipsy at a family thing, and was trying to tell him about this guy I like and how I am really struggling with this situation, and he sent me some long message about how he needed me and I just disappeared and that the friendship is one sided because all I do is ask him for help and never help him, or something, and then blocked me.

Recently his family were selling their house and I saw it online (I look at houses when I am bored sometimes) and it sent such a jolt of fear through me I can't even really explain it. I was in a call with my friends and I had to leave to go calm down. Seeing the house and the rooms and remembering being there with him just felt horrible like I felt like I was gong to be sick. Recently the house sold, which I only knew because I checked to see if it had, and then I found out that my cousin bought it. Which honestly was fine but I said to my mum that I could never go back there. And then I got really stressed out because I just had this feeling of ""well now I don't know where he is, he could be literally anywhere"" and that really freaked me out. And I looked at his mum and his' facebook to see if I could find out why they moved or where they went and seeing his face made me feel so sick like I could feel bile in my throat almost, and my anxiety had this huge spike. I have this trauma response thing (from a separate incident where I was sexually assaulted a couple of years ago) where my body physically cringes and I kind of uncontrollably clench my fists and eyes closed, and that happened to when I saw him.

But I still feel this weird link to him. It is almost like missing him but also hating him, and when I was younger I mistook this feeling often for wanting to reach out to him. I am 22 now and it  has been like this for the last 4.5 years. I have been in therapy for anxiety and sexual trauma for years now, and I have always thought that so many of my issues with sex and relationships were coming from the assault. And a lot of them probably were, but that incident is very healed in my brain now, maybe not completely, but I have made amazing improvement on it and I am so happy about that. It hardly ever bothers me any more. But even just seeing a photo of this guy's house can send me into some kind of stress spiral. I guess I just never thought it was that bad, like I knew it was a toxic relationship but I never thought of it as abusive or truly traumatising, and I always felt like I had at least some of the blame for it as well. I don't really know how to feel any more; I hate that he is still somehow a part of my life and I hate that I let him back in back in 2021. Part of me feels like it doesn't even matter though because it doesn't seem to make a difference how long I go without contact to him I always have this urge to speak with him or run into him even though I don't want to feel that way. I don't understand. I am frustrated and confused.

"I am really sorry to hear you are going through this. Intrusive thoughts are a real intense and difficult struggle. If you haven't already looked into it, they are part of the 'reexperiencing' category of trauma related symptoms. There are a few different options - most involved exposure to the memories until the hyper-arousal fades. Essentially you are going to train your brain and your body to not feel as if you are in the situation but rather understand the situation is a memory and cannot hurt the same way it did when it happened. Often intrusive memories indicate that fully processing the emotions (grief, sadness, anger, what applies to your unique situation) has not happened. This can be because we are actually inclined to avoid things that hurt, because it seems logical not to go towards pain. In the sense of emotions though, we have to actively process them, and walk through the pain for it to not come up out of no where. 

Again I'm very sorry you're going through this. In terms of things you can look into, you can look at mindfulness (thought surfing), or thought stopping. You can look into prolonged exposure therapy (which is very intense but also effective and shows results quickly), or cognitive processing therapy. Also you can read up on anything about grief related to trauma. I hope this helps, and I hope you can find peace."

"This is actually really educational for me to learn about remembering them actually being a therapeutic exercise. It makes me feel less concerned about this happening. I take a long time to grieve and I had some pet deaths stacked up in a rather short period, because I was rehabbing rescues, and I think I‚Äôm playing ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù on my emotional processing. 

If I think about it, this also happened when another very beloved pet died. And the memories did start to feel less acutely upsetting."	TikiBananiki	follow-up	na	na	na	0.992551326751709	no	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

Hello! I am Emily Hurst, a doctoral candidate completing dissertation research (IRB approved) on how exposure to trauma and/or stress may be related to ways of thinking about ourselves/others/the world. The survey does not ask for identifying information or details of experiences. The data would help expand our understanding of the different ways people respond to trauma, and assist with crafting support options that are based on our understanding of people‚Äôs responses. If you do not want to take the survey, but have questions for me, advice, or discussion points that's lovely as well -The survey takes about 15 minutes to complete, and requirements are only that you be 25 or older. 

Thank you so much for your time!

"Also looking for support
TW: SH, S‚Ä¢xual H‚Ä¢rrassment

My trauma is mostly work centered coming from my first job I had where I was s‚Ä¢xually h‚Ä¢rrassed by my boss. During that time it was also happening from different strangers, mostly older men. I'm 21F, but I look extremely young and usually get confused for 15 or 16 which apparently to gross people out there is just another way of saying ""legal."" 

I had one single emdr session where the therapist had helped me with a phobia of older men I was having at the time that was really affecting my ability to function in public. It worked, and at the time I felt everything was overcome and everything would be okay.

I'm unable to work jobs anymore. Since my first job I've been constantly job hopping because every job I have I immediately panic and have a mental breakdown where I quit very early in the job. It's not like I'm afraid the event is gonna happen again, but I just constantly have a fear and anxiety in any work environment that I can't shake. My therapist explained that it's called residual trauma, and that it's my body being ready for the next ""attack"" without me mentally being ready.

My family constantly tries to reassure me that I'll be okay and that should an event like that happen again, I have the power to quit and move on. But I find that more of a problem because I feel like all I'm constantly doing is running. I have a new job once again, and I've done 2 weeks of training where I work for 3 days a week, 4 hour shifts. I had a mental breakdown FOR A FOUR HOUR SHIFT. Alongside that my boss doesn't seem to like me because I'm quiet and the job requires talking to customers.

I just want to be normal again but I feel so helpless and stupid and weak and useless. If I can't last 4 hours how am I going to function at all in life? My therapist I'm currently seeing is not a trauma therapist, and recommended me see a trauma therapist while seeing her. However because of other mental illnesses she also suggested I see a psychiatrist to help moderate my medication I'm taking. I want to see a trauma therapist, but even that feels overwhelming. I just wish I could disappear, and I would never actually do anything to end anything, but I can't help but just not want to exist and make life harder for everyone by my lack of ability to do anything. I constantly think about contacting a crisis line, but I have it in my head that if I don't actually plan on physically harming myself what would they even do to help (i.e it being a type of emergency hotline and theres no dire emergency on my end)?

I'm sorry this is so long, I just feel I have no real outlet for anything and was hoping for any kind of hope that things can get better. I feel helpless and like there's no possible way I will ever be able to function like anyone else and i hate it. 

Thank you for anything."

How do I tell the difference? Can you give me some ideas of what would be ""usual stress reaction thinking,"" versus ""trauma reaction thinking for which you should seek more help."" I want to compare notes, but do so ""blind"" so as not to color answers and so I can more honestly assess wtf is the matter with me.

"I grew up being criticized by my mother. I always felt like I did everything wrong. Even now as an adult, I don‚Äôt know how to move past that belief. I try so hard to do everything right because I hate messing up. Even if I don‚Äôt, I can‚Äôt get past the belief that I messed up and it feels horrible.

Everything from picking the wrong restaurant, the wrong movie, suggesting an idea that might be wrong, asking a question that I should know the answer to. 

I grew up being told not to cry, and when I tried standing up for myself, I was immediately shut down. It happens now as an adult too, but now I feel like I can voice when I‚Äôm feeling invalidated. But, even after I do, I feel responsible for making everyone around me uncomfortable, or it feels like I‚Äôm the one who started a fight by voicing my feelings. 

I have so much self doubt. I try to just grin and bear it, but it‚Äôs hard. I feel like I have to pretend to be ok so I don‚Äôt inconvenience anyone.

I‚Äôm in therapy but it takes a long time to overcome past trauma. Granted I only recently made some progress. Like, understanding that it‚Äôs ok to cry. It feels like I‚Äôm barely starting the healing process.

"here's some real advice for your unhealed self. trust your therapy process and stop trying to cheat or game the therapeutic work by searching for answers online through others or through social media. bring all these doubts, fears, worries, negative thoughts into therapy and explore them and have your therapist help you navigate the origins and as you continue to create a relationship with your therapist through transference you will be able to separate these patterns and thoughts from who and how you learned them or created these beliefs and patterns and you will start to realize that you are an adult with your own beliefs and you do not need to take on your mothers criticism which you have internalized as a part of you. and overtime you will learn new healthy ways to look at yourself and the world and hopefully you will find ways to better yourself and live your life for you and not with this mentality of what your mother will think of you, which currently carries over to all your other relationships (work, school, friends, randoms) because they are all just objects that represent your mother in some way as of now. 

crying is fine. feel your feelings. no feelings are good or bad, they just are feelings and you should sit and feel them even if they are uncomfortable. then try to understand the deeper meaning of the feelings, the pain, the hurt, the anger, what is the real feeling, anger is not always anger or rage it is hurt and sadness masked, maybe you want people to understand you better, or you want someone to support you differently than you have had, or be kinder. from there you can learn what type of people you have in your life currently and what you want in your life and find the right people that are actually more positive and less critical and add value to your life not bring you down. you will learn boundaries to not associate or limit interactions with people that cause you harm, and you will learn to not take other people's feedback personal, which you are not able to now because your mother was the one that provided your needs to you: food, shelter, love, and she would take it away if you were not perfect, so you have lived a life for your mother as you have grown up hoping to be loved how you deserve to be but haven't.

you are correct, you are just starting your healing journey. you have a long way to go. .its going to take time. you cant rush it. someone telling you what to do, even me writing this out of anger because of how you keep pushing this idea that Jillian is your savior with her words...no one can tell you what to do. you will not do what anyone tells you what to do. the changes will not be permanent unless you discover all these things on your own and become aware of them on your own like ah ha moments so you actually realize and connect things. that's what therapy is for. stop going on social media and scrolling through all the love posts and mental health BS, you should know better if you do enough therapy to see that no one can help anyone without knowing their unique story, and attachment styles are just a theory and a spectrum so you cant be on type to everyone, and healing like all things...takes time. its not easy and you are going to have to face some hard truths. the question is are you willing to really do the work and be honest in therapy and to yourself or are you going to shy away and just post on reddit and not bring these things up and go into the deep dark sht you should in therapy to really get a hold of all these thoughts and views of yourself and the way you interpret the world. 

the simple answer to overcoming self doubt is to do things and gain confidence and push back on your thoughts and feelings but that's not easy. you need to start questioning what you are feeling with these doubts and when in the past has it happen, find the patterns, find the link to the root of the problem, then go back there with your therapist and work through it when you were a child to figure out if it actually makes sense to see the world the way you currently do, or did you do that as a child cause you were a child and its all you have known. 

dont ever come at any one again and tell them to do the work if you dont know them just because they dont agree with you. you should know better than anyone to tell anyone that they are wrong or they are doing something wrong or not doing something you think they are doing...cause you have experienced it all your life and you know how shtty it makes you feel. you are doing exactly what your mother has done to you by telling people to go to therapy or to do the work or trying to lecture them to believe you. forcing your thoughts and views on them like your mother. shame on you but its part of the learning process and im just pissed that you would try to insult my intelligence but that's me taking your sht personal when you really dont matter to me at all. I hope you do the work and I hope you trust the therapy process and you bring this shit into therapy rather than trying to seek the answers on reddit or online. you are paying for the help, from a professional, that knows a lot more than anyone here would know and Jillian isn't some PHD, she's just some girl that also got broken up with and makes money telling people what they want to hear, just like toxic therapyjeff who will never tell the viewer they are the problem, it's always someone else. 

trust therapy. thats your answer to overcoming all this sht you are experiencing."	zenlikerafiki	reply	na	na	na	0.985116720199585	no	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"tell people what you suggest. ask them what they think. thats how you can go about it and alleviate some of your own anxiety around making people uncomfortable. how you communicate is important.

I like x y z or I heard x y z is good, I read these reviews. What do you think about going here? Oh you don't like this place, do you have any other suggestions or an idea of what you are in the mood for and I can find some other options? Or This is where I would like to go because of x y z, what do you think?

The problem right now is you are taking on other people's feelings. It makes sense since your mother was so critical and you cared about making her happy. It has carried over to all your relationships and choices in life. You are living with her critical voice in your unconscious. As you go through therapy you will learn that everyone is responsible for their own feelings and it is not your job to put other people before yourself or you will continue to live a life you are unhappy with. They are all adults that can choose where they want to eat or what they want to watch and you can show compassion or empathize with them if they are not happy but it doesnt mean you have to solve the problem of them not choosing something else or voicing their feelings about something. 

I think if you are starting fights by expressing your feelings, then you need to continue to work on communication which will naturally happen through therapy the more you discuss your thoughts and feelings because your therapist will become a role model of a healthier way of living (communicating, boundaries, interpretation of experiences and events). 

Do some reflection on how you go about making choices, what other people do, and how you interpret what they do or say and how it goes to a negative place and also how you are talking. Obviously, the people in your life are most likely unhealed people if they are fighting with you over feelings and shit like you are talking about, and at some point you will have to accept that they are how they are and either be okay with it or disassociate but you can try to navigate around it by communicating in a healthier way that they might not view it as a confrontation but I dont know you or how you speak but no one just fights over feelings unless its delivered in a way that someone else interprets as hostile.

therapy fixes all this shit. stop searching on reddit you wont find many good answers, even on the therapists subreddit, if you actually do therapy and have a good ass therapist, you'll see how fcked up therapists really are that are posting on reddit. its best to just find a really good therapist and get your sht solved there."	zenlikerafiki	reply	na	na	na	0.985116720199585	weak	no	strong	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"tw cocsa/grooming and possible (?) domestic violence mentions

hi, sorry if this is a weird post to make (i hope this is the appropriate sub) but i'm honestly really confused and i just don't know where to ask. i guess i am hoping for some kind of validation or acknowledgement that my feelings are real bc i recently realized i might have been traumatized and i feel really weird about it.

i assumed my childhood was pretty normal and fine, even though i've always been an extremely depressed/anxious child and i remember being suicidal as far back as my memories go. i also remember very little from my childhood and i have giant periods of time (months/years) just... completely missing from my memory. that's probably not normal for kids, but somehow it never clicked for me that i might have experienced some kind of trauma.

i just turned 18 and i just moved out this month, and becoming an adult has led me to reflect and reminisce about my childhood, look at old photos, etc. when i started doing this i ""remembered"" a bunch of things that happened to me as a child. (i put remembered in quotes because they weren't repressed memories or anything, i was always aware these events happened, but i never put too much thought into them as i assumed they were normal experiences everyone goes through that didn't impact me too deeply)

* my mom and dad fought all the time growing up, my dad was a disciplinarian who spanked/slapped/physically held down me and my brother if we annoyed him by acting like kids (idk if corporal punishment counts as abuse, i know there are mixed opinions on this) my mom told me she often tried to avoid spending much time with my father because she was scared he would smash things or get very angry or violent with her
* when i was 4/5 i had a friend 1 or 2 years older than me who made me take off my clothes and kiss her and touch each other naked while ""playing prince and princess"". it was definitely coercive/forced as i repeatedly said no and remember feeling very uncomfortable. due to our ages at the time i don't know if this was just normal childhood curiosity but i feel disturbed by it anyway 
* i was homeschooled by my mom but she didn't teach me anything or pay attention to me so i was just online all day. i was given unmonitored internet access since age 7, got addicted to porn and saw a bunch of gore and stuff at that age. i saw a bunch of stuff that normalized grooming in my brain and spent a lot of time talking online to much older people who didn't have my best interests at heart
* when i was 12 i went on omegle and found 30 year old men to have e-sex with while pretending to be an older teenager. (no clue why i did this, i knew lying about my age was wrong, in hindsight i don't think i *didn't* sound 12 though.) when i was 13/14 i was groomed online by a 21 year old man who also groomed multiple other minors, and then the guy ended up getting arrested bc someone else reported him. i talked to this guy every day for hours a day for almost an entire year and it's the year of my life i remember the most vividly. if this happened to anyone else i would definitely say this is traumatic and messed up!! but because it was all online, and i basically primed myself to be groomed due to all the stuff i sought out online before meeting this guy, i feel like it was either some kind of ""fake"" trauma or something i signed myself up for.

when these things happened i remember i felt a lot of fear and anxiety at the time, but after i kind of put them behind me and rarely thought about them again? because my memory was so poor and i thought they just didn't matter/weren't that weird. but for some reason i have been i guess ""processing"" the things that barely phased me at the time they happened but now i am having some kind of delayed response to them. i've been thinking about everything a LOT over the past few weeks, i can't sleep properly, i've been having these crazy and vivid nightmares, etc. i feel like i've somehow retroactively become traumatized when i wasn't previously, and it is very bizarre...

i guess my questions are like. is it unusual or strange to suddenly have great difficulty processing things you thought you were not too impacted by? do these things even count as trauma? i feel like i was abused in some way but i don't know if i can say i was because nothing is clear-cut and everything is so ambiguous. it's not like everyone would agree that corporal punishment is clear-cut physical abuse; online grooming is maybe not that unambiguous especially since i kind of accidentally brought it upon myself. i think/was told what happened with my friend when i was 4 was cocsa but because we were both soooo young and so close in age i don't know if it was even abnormal behavior for kids. i almost ""wish"" that if i had to be so distressed that something more clear-cut and easier to define had been the cause, because i feel like i have no right to be upset about things that were not a big deal.

"- corporal punishment- aka hitting your kid- is 100% abuse and studies show that it is harmful (bc it‚Äôs abuse even people try to pass it off). There‚Äôs no other situation where hitting another human would be normalized. Imagine if a coworker hit another one, or a partner hit or held down another partner, or a kid hit another kid- all instances where it would be frowned upon and seen as bad. What you describe just sounds like physical abuse if I‚Äôm being honest and I‚Äôm sorry you were made to believe it was okay.

-  that sounds like COCSA. COCSA is still CSA and is still abuse, and it‚Äôs still valid. There‚Äôs r/COCSA that you may find helpful.

- yikes, yeah that sounds neglectful of your education and also of your safety. 

- I am also someone who went on that same website and did the same thing (as a result of other childhood stuff. I think they get people who just want affection tbh). As someone who was eventually an ‚Äúolder teenager,‚Äù I have to say, either way, even if they didn‚Äôt know, you would‚Äôve still been a victim. Nonetheless, you were literally 12-14, or even older and that doesn‚Äôt make it less of abuse, and I personally don‚Äôt know how many adults you could‚Äôve fooled. This is called online CSA/ technology assisted CSA/noncontact child sexual abuse. There‚Äôs a lot of names for it, and a bit of research starting to come out about how equally harmful it is.  I would recommend r/adultsurvivors if you ever want a group of many different types of CSA survivors (including online and COCSA). I‚Äôve found it really helpful. I‚Äôm also a part of a online CSA discord and no pressure but I can send you an invite.
- A delayed reaction to trauma is totally common. There‚Äôs actually a ptsd specification in the DSM criteria where clinicians can note it. Im not a professional, but it seems like now that you‚Äôre out of that unsafe home environment it‚Äôs possible you are in a safe enough position that your brain and  body went ‚Äúhey, I need to process this.‚Äù I‚Äôve heard of it happening before to others. A lot of what you‚Äôre saying sounds like ptsd symptoms (I say this as someone who has ptsd lol). Though I‚Äôm not a clinician or anything so I can‚Äôt diagnose you, r/ptsd has been helpful to me if you‚Äôd like somewhere to go. 
- I understand the feeling of wanting it to be worse so it was clear cut, but I promise you like so many abuse and trauma survivors, even those we may believe have ‚Äúclear cut‚Äù experiences in our eyes, struggle with invalidation. Your experiences to me DO sounds clear cut. You were a kid who were abused and groomed and you could not consent to any of this, and anyone who thinks hitting your kid is appropriate has been fooled.

I wish you the best. I promise you and your experiences are valid, and I promise you aren‚Äôt alone ‚ù§Ô∏è"	vaszszszi	reply	na	na	na	0.9980827569961548	no	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"Not even sure if this constitutes as abuse but when I was with my ex-boyfriend and I would accidentally knock something over he'd start freaking out going on about how I always break, drop, or spill something. I'd apologize profusely over and over but he'd get so mad at me every time and make me feel so embarrassed and clumsy(I'm a klutz by nature but still). He even kept a tally of my daily ""Break,Drop or Spill"".

 Other behaviors he had that I question were that if I accidentally woke him up he'd gripe how he never got to sleep because I was always loud in the morning even though I tried my absolute best to be quiet, I'd go in the room farthest away from the bedroom if I was doing anything that made noise. There were occasions where I'd be mashing up avocado in a bowl for breakfast with the bedroom door closed and I'd hear him knocking on the wall synchronized with the spoon hitting the side of the bowl, almost in a nonverbal way telling me to STFU.

If he said something and I didn't hear him when I would say ""what?"" He'd go ""haaaahhhh?"" like an obnoxious 'huh' and look at me with this facial expression that made me feel like an idiot. He also told me that I talked too much and he would only speak or say something if it was worth saying, that he hated to talk ""just to talk"". I was just always made to feel like I was some big clumsy loud stumbling fool and it bleeds into my life and current marriage today; if I do any of the things above I immediately go into fawning mode and apologize repeatedly while scrambling to clean up whatever mess I've accidentally made or I'll just pretend I've heard what my husband said so I don't have to ask him to repeat himself. 

If these are just bad behaviors then that's one thing but I've been questioning if it was abusive even over 3 years after I haven't been with my ex. Appreciate y'all, thank ya much."	cantstopabus	post	27.57214965411298	female	White	0.9962043166160583	na	na	na	7	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

Honestly, sounds abusive to me.

"I posted this to r/selfimprovement and got one great comment, but I still need advice. A bit over year ago I moved away from my hometown and out of state. Shortly before that, I had cut off a few toxic friends for mental health/personal growth reasons. I ended up blocking them on everything, or so I thought. This particular friend had never given me an explicit reason to cut her off besides the fact that she was involved with (and related to) people I didn't want to be involved with. She's been absolutely unhinged in the past (physical fights, verbal fights, revenge plots etc.) and nothing was ever directed towards me, until today.
  

  
Basically I get an angry text message today calling me a bunch of names, saying I'm selfish, miserable, and making fun of where I work (even though she was wrong about where I'm working). So random and unprovoked. Totally ruined my day, even though I know it shouldn't. I'm in a good place right now and I've worked through a lot of things on my own, I'm really proud of that, but this is one of those things I'm having a hard time with. I didn't say anything and blocked her, but I'm still upset. 
  

  
How do you not let people like this bother you? Is there something I can tell myself to soften the blow? I know she's just miserable and angry deep down, but it still gets a rise out of me. It makes me mad, and it makes me anxious through the roof cause I don't know what else she or any of them are going to do now. That group of people have a lot of ugly photos of me and videos of me being drunk and stupid (another reason I cut them off - they shut me down when I stated I was thinking about sobriety). What if they put me on blast on social media or something? Idk. I just really need help so I don't let people like this keep disrupting my (finally peaceful) life."	merm4idgirl111	post	19.411525871390854	male	White	0.9994157552719116	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

there is probably a word for this. but i feel like in order to cope with not having a normal life, i almost have to role play being a normal 20 year old girl. in my natural state i‚Äôm not very positive and don‚Äôt indulge in traditionally feminine things and i have plenty to worry about. sometimes when times are bad i feel the need to almost pretend my entire life is normal and has always been normal. i have playlists full of popular and happy music, i have basic and popular feminine clothes i put on, and i become obsessed with feeling like this. i want to feel like a girl who has never gone through hard times and is privileged so i almost pretend that i am. i can‚Äôt tell if this is healthy or not but i have a feeling it‚Äôs a pretty neutral coping mechanism? hopefully this makes sense or maybe this resonates with someone who can put it into better words than i can.

"I had something very traumatic happen to me for the first time in my life and I was freaking out so bad, found out I was having serve panic attacks I have anxiety so I know what it is like to be anxious but never did I realize panic attacks could get so bad. 

So I went to the hospital I sat in Jefferson hills hospital for 4 hours and they were so busy I couldn‚Äôt bring me back to a room so I panicked in their waiting room for hours and my brother who brought me to the hospital told front desk ‚Äúhey she is getting worse can someone come see her?‚Äù The tall skinny guy at the front desk said ‚Äúwhat do you expect me to do? She is just her for mental health‚Äù 

Finally I get called back and see a dr and he said ‚Äúyour blood work looks good you‚Äôre good to go and try to think happy thoughts‚Äù he said that as I was crying and trying to focus on breathing. He told me to follow up with pcp. 

I see a pcp that was available the next day and I told her what happened and she said it was weird that I was having back to back panic attacks and she said why didn‚Äôt the hospital treat me? I told her they said my blood work was good there was nothing to treat. She said they had better medicine they could offer me and there wasn‚Äôt much she could do for me. 

So she prescribed me vistaril to go with the other anxiety medications I am taking doxapin and respiradone and said if I still have panic attacks go back to the er. Needless to say I went that night I went back to Jefferson and this time I actually put in a room and the dr. Halfman was good. the older nurse that was there was complete garbage she did not know how to handle Someone that was freaking out having a panic attack plus I am autistic. The younger nurse came in to take over and she was more compassionate the dr prescribed Ativan with the vistaril that the pcp prescribed plus with the other meds I take regularly and it was the first time I felt the anxiety ease off my shoulders and I felt like I could breathe.

They watched me for a few hours and the dr told me to see someone specializes in trauma and follow with my pcp and see if she would be ok with writing a script for Ativan for me to take with the vistaril, doxapin and respiradone since that gave me some relief but I would still have to work thru the trauma. 

I went to my pcp next day and she said that Ativan is not something she can prescribe I would have to see mental health services. I told her that could take a really long time and what was I suppose to do in the mean time because I‚Äôm hardly functioning. She said all i could do was try BuSpar and I told her I tried that in the past and it didn‚Äôt do anything for my anxiety just made me tired. 

She said that was my only option so I should try it. I just can‚Äôt believe that is my only option to take a medication that does not help me. I also can‚Äôt believe she is ok with me taking buspar on top of doxapin, respiradone, and vistaril that all is just for anxiety and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm currently taking That doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me. 

Does anyone have advice on what my options are to see mental services faster that would help me with my trauma and medication? I don‚Äôt want to keep getting bounced from pcp to er I feel like they don‚Äôt know what to do to help me. I have austism so I have a hard time communicating properly and advocating for myself and my needs."

"I really like the book The Language of Emotions and what it says to do with these. In particular, the ""internal questions"" for guilt/shame are: ""Who has been hurt? What must be made right?""

In this case, I think those questions can be revealing for how this kind of guilt can kind of get its wires crossed. You should definitely consider the questions yourself, but for me they'd be something like: ""Both of us got hurt. To make things right, I need to do my best to own my own shit while keeping solid boundaries and letting them own their shit. And in the end, not being together is definitely right for maintaining my own boundaries and self-respect""

I find that answering these questions as truthfully as I can to my whole knowledge/experience of the situation helps me feel more solid in my position and feel more confident that I'm acting on my guilt the best way I know how, and that usually lets the guilt know that its job is done and it can relax some.

I listen to podcasts. In my case, it's a combination of Betrayal Trauma, porn addiction, a shade of narcissism, and then my OWN stuff, childhood emotional neglect.

"I also try to change the thoughts (as mentioned above). Rather than think about how guilty I should feel for not being in contact, I think about the lack of guilt they felt, and the inability to even talk about that with me. When I see that we are not a good fit, and that they are emotionally damaging, the guilt doesn't feel so heavy.

"I am a 20M who had a bad friend in high school. At first we were great friends, but over the years, they began to get controlling and manipulative. They would compete with me, berate me, belittle me, diminish my accomplishments, and towards the end, outright sabotage me. The feeling of realizing someone you hold close is working against you is a feeling I cannot describe unless you've felt it yourself.

When it ended, I didn't have the words to express myself. My friends remained friends with this person, partially for this reason, and partially because they just wanted everyone to get along. But it always felt awkward to talk about because of this, so we never did. While I understand that my friends were still close with this person, I never felt supported. I was close with this friend group since childhood and I can't help but feel disappointed by this.

This brings me to the problem: it's been 5-6 years since this happened and I still find myself relaying the same events over and over. I don't feel like I am healing. At this point, I don't know if it's the bad friend that is bothering me, or the lack of support from my friend group when I really needed it. Or maybe I just want to be understood. I just don't feel valued by either party, even though my friends are genuinely good people (despite not being the best friends to me). 

Honestly, I don't see this friend group working for me in the long term. Even if this were to be resolved, there would still be a shared history. While I would like to talk about this with my friends, I worry that they will see that the friendship it isn't working as well, changing the dynamic irreversibly. I worry that I cannot talk about this (for understanding purposes) without critiquing my friends, their lack of support, and their choice to remain friends with this person. I would like to find another friend group, but I worry that not talking about this with my friends will hinder my ability to find closure going forward.

TLDR; I had a bad friend in high school, my friends remained close with them, I don't know how to find closure.

I would speak your truth. Your friends will either accept it, or the dynamic may change but that's okay. It's okay because the dynamic you have right now isn't helping you. You keep reliving these events and with no support at that. It might feel like less of a critique of your friends if you perhaps did it individually.

"I honestly don't  know what to call what happened to me while I blacked out. I(F23) blacked out last night and my friend's house. I drank definially more than I needed to while celebrating my friend's birthday. This morning I woke up to people walking on eggshells around me. Apparently during the night a guy claimes that I was really into him and making out with him in someones bedroom. After that he says that i wanted to sleep with him so he locked us in a bathroom downstairs. My friend's boyfrined did see that I looked too drunk and he went to ask his girlfriend if he should stop it.   I cant get an answer on what happened in the bathroom but my friends bf did get me out of the bathroom  after much much banging on the door. My friend said that i was apparently sobbing and shaking for a good time after that and that I was so drunk that I couldn't make sense of what happened. They kept asking me about him and what happened but I was just so drunk and confused. I hadn't even known his name and I don't even remember seeing him at the party.  I don't think it was rape or assult because I don't even know if anything happened. I also don't know how long I had blacked out or was with this guy alone. He did leave very quickly while my friends bf was yelling at him. I wish i knew what happened so i could feel better about myself but I don't and I don't know that I will ever get an answer. What should I do? I have no clue how to process this

I'm so disapointed in myself for getting that drunk. I'm embarissed and confused on what happened. It's scary how little I remembered after taking my last shot. It is safe to say that terrified of drinking.

I (20F) have never told anyone this because I am too afraid of what would follow. When I was 17, I was masturbating one night and my dad walked it. Instead of giving me privacy he pulled down the sheets and revealed me with my hands still in my pants and touched where my hand was and had a weird and scary smile on his face. He held his hand before leaving and this memory has terrified me ever since. I don't know what to do. Am I over exaggerating to say that this is trauma? 

I became scared of him but then a year later at my highschool graduation my cousin talked about how my dad slapped her ass as a ""joke"" and was confused when she got upset. Ever since I was 12 my dad has also done that to me as a joke. After I talked with my cousin I became disgusted with him. I never once understood that he shouldn't be doing that. He also bites my neck and does other weird stuff that makes me feel sick when I think about. I am scared to talk to anyone, including my boyfriend or mom about it because I'm scared of the consequences. I was raped by a close childhood friend when I was younger and my mom did nothing to protect me so I am also scared that she'll get mad at me or do nothing again. It's eating at me and it has made me scared to masturbate in my own house even as an adult. 

Would this still be considered trauma? Am I over exaggerating? I don't know what to do and I don't know who to talk to."	Apprehensive-Soil639	post	5.081641963861209	female	White	0.9966115355491638	na	na	na	8	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"You‚Äôre not over exaggerating and this is absolutely
 trauma.

There‚Äôs nothing that can‚Äôt be traumatic. Trauma isn‚Äôt solely about the event itself ‚Äî it‚Äôs also about how you respond to it and what support and coping mechanisms (or lack of) you have in the aftermath. So whilst people commonly talk about trauma in terms of rape, combat, car crashes etc. it can be caused by literally anything. You can break your toe and become traumatised from that. Its how the incident affects you, not what the incident itself is. 

(This isn‚Äôt me comparing what happened to you to something as ‚Äòminor‚Äô as breaking your toe, btw ‚Äî I‚Äôm just using that as an example of how anything can be traumatic.)

What your dad did to you is awful and inappropriate. It‚Äôs understandable that you feel terrified and disgusted, not just because of what he did to you, but because of what‚Äôs clearly a pattern of vile behaviour towards young women that he should be caring for. Slapping a 12 year olds ass as a ‚Äújoke‚Äù is CSA. Putting his hand over yours whilst you‚Äôre masturbating is CSA. Biting your neck is incredibly weird, and I can guarantee that anything else weird he does that makes you feel ill is most likely CSA too. It may not seem that way, because when we hear CSA we tend to think of rape, molestation, etc. But CSA comes in many forms and what your dad is doing is particularly insidious because a lot of it is stuff that could be seen as ‚Äúclose family joking about‚Äù ‚Äî both to an outside perspective and to you yourself. But it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs sick and it‚Äôs wrong and he knows this. 

Do you have any familiar support besides your mom? Do you think your boyfriend would be understanding? If you feel able to, it might help to open up to him about it. Of course, I don‚Äôt know the dynamics of your relationship, but if you think he would be supportive it might be a good idea. Ditto any close friends you feel
comfortable talking to. I would obviously also recommend therapy if that‚Äôs an option for you ‚Äî particularly because it gives you a safe outlet to talk without any consequences of your family finding out.

"I think all of us with trauma have moments (or months or years) of thinking we're exaggerating. IMO, It's the brain trying to fit this awful experience into the rest of our lives as if it wasn't traumatic. 

What your father did and does is definitely sexual abuse and sexual harassment. It is trauma.

I hope you can and do get therapy. Even if that's not affordable or otherwise doable for you rn, there are anonymous hotlines you can call when the feelings are too intense or when you can't feel anything. Look up national, regional, state, and county hotlines.

"I think that it's easy to think of ""trauma"" as an event or situation, but trauma is actually the injury. Let's think about it like a paramedic.

Different people's bodies can respond differently to similar events, like in a car accident. Different people will have different injuries based on a number of factors in ""similar"" accidents. This includes the weather conditions of the crash, what vehicle they were driving, were they intoxicated, how did they respond to the situation in the moment they did, what safety features did the car have, physical health conditions like osteoporosis, etc. etc. Some people will walk away from the crash, others will narrowly avoid one entirely, some will have minor injuries....and some people will have trauma, or grievous injuries. And people can have similar trauma from different situations-- be it a car crash, a workplace injury, a hiking accident, what have you-- that once inflicted, the *trauma* is what's treated, not what caused it.

We understand this, right? It's easier with physical health.

You aren't ""over exaggerating"" anything, regardless of how ""bad"" the situation was. Trauma is an injury. Do you have an injury? One that has not been properly treated or managed? Has it been affecting your life? Has it been causing you pain?

That's trauma. It sounds like you're saying yes to all of that, but only you know for sure, so ask yourself these questions. And strangers on the Internet can help, but I strongly encourage a therapist to regularly process this. No one has to be told what the therapist is really for, just like no one is obligated to discuss how they received a life-altering physical trauma and why they have to, for example, go to physical therapy regularly. It may be expensive and something you have to hunt for resources, but if you look at it like someone prioritizing pain and symptom management in the aftermath of a car accident to get a physical therapist, it's a little easier to grasp how important this may be to address for you however you can.

That all being said and to get the opinion you asked for about how bad it seems because who am I to say it doesn't matter/wouldn't help: What your dad did to you makes me wish I could break your dad's kneecaps."

"Hi everyone, so as the title of this post states, my anxiety lately has been causing me to get in some minor car accidents, which is a problem on its own of course but I am also worried that this has the potential to cause a worse accident one day and maybe harm others or myself  
For a little backstory, about 12 years ago I was in a head-on collison which was caused by a drunk driver driving into me on a parkway.  I suffered a severe brain injury and was in a coma for 32 days before waking up, I and spent another month or so in rehab.  Year after year I realize that my brain is still healing, which is crazy to think it still is after all this time.  But if I think back to a year earlier I can see how much better my brain is now than it was a year ago, and this consistently happens year over year.  Issues I have had with the injury which keep improving is short-term memory loss (I used to not even be able what I had for breakfast each day no matter how much time I was given to remember), coupled with anxiety, stubbornness, and a short temper (all three of which I believe are interrelated).  I used to be very outgoing, and I am still an extrovert, but even with that said I prefer to be alone or just with my wife rather than going out to functions, etc, even though I have fun at them.  
So, anyways, today I ""parked"" in front of my mom's house to drop something off.  I got out of the car, dropped off what I needed to drop off, and decided to go get the mail for my mom.  I wanted to get back home as I was not planning on leaving the house that day.  As I was walking down the driveway I saw my car rolling into the close garage door... I forgot to put it in park.  Whole garage door came off the wall.  
Another accident a little while ago was when I had to stay 15 min later at work.  I had nowhere else to be, was in no rush to get anywhere, but felt this feeling of having to get home.  In a rush, I crashed the side of my car into the column next to me.  Thankfully, it wasn't someone else's car.  
The advice I normally get is to just ""chill out"".  I try meditating daily, excericse daily, eat right, practice mobility, etc.  People even tell me they're impressed sometimes at how well I can keep my cool, but really I'm just anxious of overreacting.  Point is, I don't think just ""taking it easy"" or ""chilling out"" is working.  
I am signing up to go see a neurologist and a psychiatrist, but I am not really sure what the difference is.  Does anybody have any advice on what I can try to do to stop these impulses and/or memory lapses from happening?  How can I make sure that I don't do something really stupid or dangerous one day out of pure just lack of being able to realize that I am not thinking?"

"A psychiatrist diagnoses mental health disorders and, most frequently, prescribes medication for them. 

Because your primary mental health symptom seems to be intermittent anxiety, you might see better long-term results if you see a counselor. There is research available that shows that people who only receive counseling for their mental health symptoms have the best long-term outcomes. 

Sometimes medication is absolutely necessary, and only you can make that decision. If you feel that medication is necessary, feel free to take it. Otherwise, consider holding off for now. 

A neurologist diagnoses and treats disorders of the brain and nervous system. This can include medication, but doesn't have to. If your problem is largely due to inattention because of the head injury, this could be really helpful. 

I personally feel like you should probably not drive by yourself until you can get this sorted out. This is really, really dangerous. So far you've been really lucky to have only had minor accidents, but you'd probably never forgive yourself if you seriously injured someone else. Because the root cause of this is a brain injury, the solution might be complex and several months away."

"Journaling has been very difficult for me as well. I understand the concept and what the benefits could be, but for some reason it's difficult for me.

Instead I sent texts. Or just write out text and don't send them. I find distilling what I'm dealing with down into a reasonable length text to be very focus inducing and really helps me process whatever thoughts are racing through my mind.

If you have somebody that you can trust to send these to, I definitely suggest giving it a try. And even if you don't, try distilling your thoughts down into a concise couple of sentences that describe what you're struggling with.

It's been really helpful for me in the effort to get in front of the negative ideation that we can all spiral into. And helpful in developing the ability to have some degree of positive ideation, which we are all trying to learn how to do.


Journaling and grounding exercises are examples, maybe working with the ideas of what the goals are can help you come up with a method that works for you.

You're going through a hard time, but like the last hard time this one will not last. You're making the right moves in reaching out for support when your main support isn't available.

I think I have not had these on my mind so I forgot how that can feel until some things reminded me recently.

"How does anyone tell what love actually is?

I have abandonment and neglect traumas. It's so easy to fall for someone who shows care and consideration towards me because I just need it so badly. This clouds my vision to everything else. I get left with wondering if it's really a match but that need is so strong I just want more and more and everything else takes a back seat.

I feel this is also opening me up to abuse and traumas I haven't experienced yet and don't have that sense for.

"Hi! So I was a trauma-kid. Child of an alcoholic and a hoarder, victim of emotional, mental, and religious abuse. I was in counseling on and off from kindergarten.

I would‚Äôve been around 6-8 yrs old (and of course, fitting with the trauma, very ‚Äúmature‚Äù for my age). 

It was definitely a board game used for counseling and play therapy. It was old looking (like the clue deluxe game if you‚Äôve ever seen that!) with pawns that looked like the ones from Sorry! or Parcheesi. You could pull cards that had horrific life events, like death and divorce. I think you were supposed to talk about what you would do in each situation?

"A warning before I begin: the topics of possible sexual assault, child abuse, suicides and insults will come up.

It happened between when i was 9 or 11 years old. I had a dream. In this dream I saw a man threatening my mother with a kitchen knife. When I woke up, I later asked my mother who this man was. It turned out that it was my stepfather, now ex-stepfather. I also found out that he was in prison. Since then I wanted to know what happened during the time I was 2 to 4 because i can't remeber anything. From the age of 5 I lived with my father.

I can still faintly remember that my mother left me and my older half-sister on a street. My half-sister has difficulties with her psyche because of several factors and has tried several times to kill herself, but since she has a daughter she has become more stable. I asked my half sister after our ex stepfather and she told me everything that happened. It was just horrible. He was an alcoholic and very easily irritable because of it.

Our mother and my half siblings were beaten. Since I am the youngest and had to go to the hospital regularly because of a heart defect, I am the only one who was not beaten. Unfortunately, our mother is not so innocent either, because she also beat her children and insulted them daily. But now comes something where I could just puke. Our stepfather has not only raped his biological daughter, but also my half sister. According to my half-sister, he tried to rape me too, but she was able to stop it. 

Just a reminder, i was in this time 2 to 4 years old. I think that explains why I have an aversion to alcohol and don't feel so comfortable around older men. I plan to go to therapy.  Because even though I can't remember everything, it affects me a little bit. It doesn't help that I have an anxiety disorder. My father was in a coma when I was 16 and his chances of survival were very slim. He had pneumonia and an infection that developed behind it.  On the way to the hospital he had to be resuscitated. Since then I have a fear of not knowing where he is or how he is doing. The same goes for people who mean something to me like friends."

I lost a dear family member in a very tragic way and am certainly traumatized by the experience but it‚Äôs been over ten years since then. This past week my good friend lost a family member in a different but sudden and tragic way. I was the closest person available to her as she processed the event in the moments shortly after she found out. In a way I felt honored to be able to be there for her and have some sense of understanding what she was experiencing and needing from another person in those moments. But now I am wondering if I need to do anything to make sure this experience didn‚Äôt further traumatize me. As I‚Äôm writing this I‚Äôm tearing up a bit and I wouldn‚Äôt have thought it based on how I‚Äôve felt the last week (generally ok I guess). Am I going to be ok or should I talk to someone?	interactive-biscuit	post	46.824444969123604	male	White	0.9818821549415588	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"11 years ago I left an abusive relationship. After being together for a few months and then married for 8 months I endured so much. What started off as just controlling behavior rapidly turned into almost daily physical abuse. Any little thing could spark his anger and quickly get out of control. I went from someone who had no fear of confrontation to hiding and lying about anything and everything to ‚Äúkeep the peace‚Äù. 
Now here I am in a healthy marriage with someone who loves me and spoils me and genuinely cares about me and I still can‚Äôt be honest. Buffering lies. Lies to avoid any sort of confrontation. 
I have never been good with money management and I refuse to ask for help from my husband. I received a summons and complaint regarding a Target credit card that I initially owed $240 and completely forgot about. C/C statements went to my email and were ignored/avoided. They are now suing for $599.10. When I was served I told my husband it was nothing, it was an old c/c, it was past the statue of limitations, blah blah blah. Anything to avoid talking about it and admitting that maybe I have a small issue. I‚Äôm taking care of it, but he snooped and knows I lied. 
He knows I have trauma but it‚Äôs not up for discussion and I doubt he knows exactly how bad I am with coping. Or that I avoid confrontation. Or that I have avoidance issues. Or that I have panic attacks that I‚Äôve learned to hide well.  

How do I stop? How do I open up to a man that I do trust, that has proven he‚Äôs got me, that I shouldn‚Äôt have these responses to? I know I shouldn‚Äôt hide stuff or lie to him and that he will always help me figure it out. But I can‚Äôt seem to be honest with him."

Hey I need some general answers in reference to my childhood trauma, from sexual abuse, physical abuse and of course verbal abuse. I‚Äôve been married to my 2nd husband for 24 years and I am finally getting the help I need. I suppressed my traumas for 50 years and now everything wants to come out at once. My husband finds me attractive but I don‚Äôt see myself pretty or attractive, sexy and anything in between. I have a lot of triggers and I told him when we were dating that he couldn‚Äôt fix me. I don‚Äôt know if I became his project to try and fix or not. He knows everything that has happened to me, I completely understand that it‚Äôs not my fault in my head, but my heart tells me something different. What I know is that I can‚Äôt stop hearing my past in my head, so it‚Äôs difficult to move forward until I resolved my past. I‚Äôve tried to get through to my husband but it‚Äôs not working. I need to focus on my journey of healing and myself before I can focus on anyone else. I don‚Äôt know what else to do because all I want is love and patience to get through this shit and be his wife again. I‚Äôm not interested in intimacy just a caring person who will be here when I come through the other side of this trauma.

"I recently remembered something odd. 

Growing up, I had a neighbor across the street who was around my age. She lived with her grandparents and dad. 

Recently, I remembered a (probably) summers day, when I was an elementary schooler playing outside, when her dad pulled up in one of his loud cool looking cars and asked if I wanted to go see Kung Fu Panda with him in theater. His daughter wasn't there that day. I remember one of my parents, I think my mom, being outside with me. The grownups talked a bit and agreed I could go. I remember just a tiny snippet of the drive, how small I was in his fancy car with big wheels, then a tiny bit of the movie too I think. 

When I remembered this, I thought it was odd. It wasn't that I hadn't remembered it before, but this was the first time I thought of it when I was an adult and able to recognize how strange the situation was. 

I texted my parents about it and they insist they wouldn't have agreed for him to take me to a movie alone. I swear they did, though.

This doesn't feel like it was a dream. It doesn't feel scary or upsetting, either. I just remember feeling awkward, as I didn't know the man too well and his daughter was a bit of a bully to me when we'd hang out.

I suppose it may be relevant to state that his daughter, my childhood friend/bully, had some hypersexual tendencies and expressed enough red flag behavior that, looking back on it, I believe she had a pretty messed up childhood. Not sure who that stemmed from, though, since her grandpa isn't the best with kids and her dad only lived with her sometimes.

So yeah... what do I do now? I don't think he did anything to me.

I can't stop thinking about how weird it is that my parents claim it didn't happen, though. I swear they'd admitted it happened at some other point in my childhood when I'd mentioned it. But maybe I never did mention it. My memories of any of this are too groggy, just shadows of feelings and snippets of images. 

My instinct, though I doubt I'll act on it, is to find a way to reach out to his daughter and ask if she remembers him ever mentioning anything about taking me out to a movie. Ask her if this sounds terribly outlandish or genuinely plausible.

But yeah, I dunno.

"hi everyone! this is my first post on here and im a bit worried that my problem is more of a problem and not really trauma so could you please give me input on your thoughts! Last year I had a really bad breakup with my best friend of over 6 years called A and it ended horribly, we were in a 3 person group Me, O and A - plus A had another best friend R that I wasn't really friends with. A always was more of the leader of the group and she got really mad at every little thing i used to do, eg. when playing minecraft if i didn't help with buildings and went to do my own builds (silly stuff like that). A also reguarly got in fights with R and would complain about R to us, calling her annoying and stuff (although they were very very close best friends). The same happened vise versa, A would then complain to R about Me and O. At the beginning of last year, A and I had a big fight about something silly and we were both in the wrong. I apologised to her but when she 'apologised' she sent a full paragraph of a 'joke' apology she found on discord, saying stuff like ""I'm sorry you were sad, I didn't know I could control emotions"" (just a whole paragraph of that). She also sent this 'apology' to R AND O for her to read and but R and O both disapproved because it was just very violent and attacking for no reason but she sent it anyways. Once again, I apologised and all I ever wanted was just a simple, 'I'm sorry' but it never really came. 

The big breakup was during later last year when R, O and A were going to a cosplay event thing together (I wasn't into that) and basically A had gotten these Volleyball friends and cancelled on R and O to go with them instead and told her vball friends alot about our business. When we said we didn't apperciate it, she really blew up and got mad at R for some reason even though she was sick in bed at the time and was not involved. R then sent a message to A saying like 'Hey are you mad at me? Lets fix this"" and A responded very violently and i was so confused because the message was super passive and nice?? It was all very confusing because there was so much unecessary rage from A directed at O and R (not really significantly me because I was trying to mediate the whole situation). So I got stuck in the middle and hearing A complain about R and O for the SMALLEST things such as like playing genshin wrong (very weird and niche) or like even just making eye contact would piss her off so bad. She went and confronted R and even though R had some stuff to say to A, A took over the whole conversation and said that she really wanted to smash her and O's head into the pavement because she was so angry at them. R just ended apologising profusely for literally no reason at all and she eventually had to go to therapy to deal with the whole friendship being controlled and emotionally manipulated by A. 

So after all this, R, Me and O really bonded over the whole extremely stressful situation and A ended up moving schools. Whenever me, R or O get in very small disagreements like so miniscule eg. I end pushing someone to tell me a secret that another person told them. Like I fully get panic attacks because i geuninely feel so bad for pushing them to talk or say something when they are completely fine and don't think much about it. Since A used to get very mad and ignore me, when R or O don't respond to my texts, I always get extreme anxiety that they are mad at me and our whole friendship will crumble apart (even though I know it won't because R and O are extremely empathtic and understanding/geuninely apologises and works stuff out with each other.) But I just get such an overwhelming sense of anxiety and guilt when i disagree with them on stuff im so scared our friendshipp will all be over because they are my closest friends. I guess what im trying to say is, am I overreacting like i need to work on my emotions in general or do i have some form of like extremely extremely light trauma from the situation with A and due to her isolating behaviour??"

"it was a whole year of bliss but after the breakup I reflected and remembered the numerous times he full on r*ped me and would use sex in a very controlling, coercive,  and threatening way. It‚Äôs caused a lot of trauma for me and for my family.  and I‚Äôm still processing my anger. 

But some night, I‚Äôll dream of us together again. Having sex, in love, but very very anxious. I‚Äôll wake up and ruminate on all the good times. And think about how handsome he is and how much I miss kissing him.

 I hate saying that. Because he has hurt me so much. Irreversible damage. 

How could I crave someone who has fooled me already? It‚Äôs been months since the breakup. And weeks since accepting the monster he is and that he was not the man I thought. 

 I‚Äôm still drowning in anger and pain. And sometimes the feeling of loneliness turns to feeling like I miss his touch. Even though im disgusted.

"It‚Äôs the trauma bonding. ‚ÄúYou broke me but you‚Äôre also the only one who can fix me‚Äù They break you down then comfort you. That way you think only they can make you feel that way.

The urges pass and those moments become less and less over time and healing. I‚Äôm getting to the point now where it makes me ill to think of him in that capacity (we coparent unfortunately). I also think (for me personally) me ‚Äúfantasizing‚Äù about the ‚Äúgood‚Äù times took away the pain of the SA.

"Warning: there is some not good stuff in this post(mentions of rape, grooming?, child pornography)
Let me know if I missed anything.

Just wanted to get this off my chest.

I sometimes don‚Äôt know what to think. How exactly it got to where it did is beyond me but my very first experience was when I opened the tabs on their phone. It was a picture of a woman bent over on a bed with only panties and a shirt. There was a white wall in the background and I can remember the picture being a little grainy. I think her underwear was a shade darker than baby blue but I‚Äôm not so sure anymore. I had simply asked what this was and I got the response of she is bent over to be alluring. I didn‚Äôt quite understand then but I do now. It was a porn picture. My infantile 9 year old self hadn‚Äôt know about porn. I knew about sex but my image was vague at best and skewed at worst. I don‚Äôt remember a lot and I don‚Äôt know if I have forgot or blocked off the more painful stuff but I still remember a lot. To this day I wonder if I had asked for it or dished it out because it feels like I was the one chasing after it. I was in grade 4 and any 9 year old wants toys. That‚Äôs what I got in return for any time I made them finish. Once we were on the couch with my mother upstairs and we were about to start. Anytime we did it I just wanted it to be over with. They were insistent to know what I wanted in return ahead of time. I was so unsure because I didn‚Äôt want to cross a line. With them being annoyed, we ended up agreeing $30 at toys r us. I don‚Äôt even remember what happened after we agreed. I don‚Äôt remember ever going all the way but again I don‚Äôt remember a lot. The very first time it went as far as I remember they were lying on my old childhood bed. A queen size bed with plain pink sheets. I used my hand. It was the very first time I saw cum. I was absolutely disgusted. It looked so gross and the smell made me gag. Eventually, not on the same night, we ended up looking at a porn site. It‚Äôs not a lighter porn site that if you were to look up rape it tells you off for looking for that, I was one that embraced it. Probably one of the most disturbing things I saw on that site was animated women being hung. It didn‚Äôt even seem overly sexual, they were fully dressed just being hung. Or another on was a real girl was was being assaulted? But had a zip tie around her neck that looked much to tight and looked like she was pretty much passed out. I stumbled on a thing where people used their feet to get someone off. I thought it was genius. I wouldn‚Äôt have to touch it and could stay as far away as possible. It didn‚Äôt get them off so it ended with my hand still being used.

I always came downstairs when the house was asleep. The only one awake was them and me in the basement where their computer was. It didn‚Äôt happen every night. Only when I woke up from my 8o‚Äôclock bed time and went downstairs. Another time based on my memory when we went camping. We were going to a provincial park and we both went to take a shower. They ended up in my shower space and they used my thighs to get off. In between my thighs I remember feeling it but I preferred doing this in the shower because I didn‚Äôt have to deal with the cum. The sticky and warm and gross and smelly cum that I would avoid at all cost coming in contact with me. But in the shower I couldn‚Äôt feel it because the water was warm and just went right down my legs to the ground and down the drain. Away from me. In a way the water purged me of this disgusting act because when it was finally over I could no longer feel something over then them behind me thrusting between my thighs. This happened in the shower 1 other time that I‚Äôm able to recall. To be honest it probably happened more than that.Another time that really stood out to me was when we went to drop our trailer off to storage. We dropped it off and we ended up on my parents bed. Halfway through, I ask what would happen if my mom found out. It wasn‚Äôt quite a threat but divorce was in the table. Then they got angry when I started to cry because I didn‚Äôt want my parents to divorce and I was scared that my mom would leave me. I ended up finishing him with the final reminder that it‚Äôs only if she finds out. I don‚Äôt remember any of the sexual act or what exactly happened after I stopped crying. I think deep down at this point I knew what we were doing was wrong but I just kept coming back. Or I was lured back because I trusted him. 

There were times were they wanted me to do oral on them. It was always kiss the tip. I always gave dry kisses and was grossed out after it. They tried to do oral to me. Compared to my kids, witch was all I agreed to do theirs was wet with a peek of tongue. It always made me shiver in disgust and being repulsed by this it luckily never went further than that. It‚Äôs still make we shiver with disgust that goes right down my spine. I think this was what really grossed me out the most from all my experiences with them. I guess they had kind of gotten what they wanted in the end because they pulled a vibrator out and told me it was a massager. I don‚Äôt know how the topic got brought up but it was later revealed that it was also a sexual toy. Out of curiosity i tried it and I hate that I finished. All I remember that they said it looked like it felt good and I remember pretty much dismissing the remark. I think this happened 2 other times. Other than that I think some times they tried to convince themselves that I was getting wet. Maybe I was but it would never have been because I was turned on. We need nice almost got caught. We were not doing anything sexual but  I went downstairs one night and my mom came down and I got yelled at for being out of bed. They were only playing video games but I guess we were still caught. I almost wish she caught us in the act. Maybe I could‚Äôve gotten help or she would have blamed me. I don‚Äôt know and I‚Äôm scared to find out. I can vividly remember them looking at child pornography. It was a red head that was my age who was surrounded my fake nature that was a glorified photo shoot. And another time when we were looking at a music video that was all bout butts they called me over to grope my butt and told me my butt was comparable to one of the girls in the video. 

For a year or two I‚Äôm not sure anymore but at lease durning the ages of 9 and 10 this continued until it stopped. I don‚Äôt know how or why it stopped but I think about it a lot to this day. I‚Äôm sure there is more that my brain has locked away to keep me sane. And some days I absolutely loathe him for all he has done to me but he is my father and it puts me it such a hard spot because I would destroy my family with this out in the open.

I don‚Äôt know what I want to do but I know that sometime I fantasize about going to his funeral and exposing him for all he has done to me and other days I hope to every possible higher being that he regrets what he has done. Other days I feel like it was my fault that he did it and I also wonder if he did it to anyone else. I hope he hasn‚Äôt. I would never wish this on any human being no matter how despicable they are. No living organism deserves this but still care for him and I don‚Äôt know why. Maybe i. The end I just want to be heard because this has sat with me for 7 years now and I have never truly been able to tell anybody so thank you for reading to the end."	gdidivrb	post	25.151327954245033	female	White	0.9888339638710022	na	na	na	3	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"So.. i dunno if this counts as trauma so.. feel free to delete if not. I‚Äôm unsure..

so in every school i‚Äôve been too i‚Äôve been bullie‚Ä¶ last two were the most screwed up though..

the first one had me almost pushed down the stairs, singled out, losing my ONLY friend at the time.. (i made a new one, he‚Äôs still with me today) and just hurt alot..

&#x200B;

second one was worse towards the end. it was a joint wchool so the other students from the main area didn‚Äôt really interact with us but there was one, ONE person who tried coming after a student in the other class we had.

they bust in during lunch one time, hurt the student before leaving. Left me crying due ti pure fear despite not being the one urt.

last one was worse,, something.. happened and teachers were shouting at me ‚ÄúHURRY UP!‚Äù AND I DON‚ÄôT REMEMBER MUCH AT ALL IT WAS WORST I‚ÄôVE FELT IN YEARS I ONLY REMEMBER BEING AGAINST THW CUPBOARD/DRAWER IN THE CLASSROOM WAILINGBEVAUSE I WAS SO FUCKING SCARED OF HER AND I WANTED TO GO HOME I COULDN‚ÄôT GO HOME I COULDN‚ÄôT SEE MY MUM I COULDN‚ÄôT I JUST WANTED MY MUM OR COMFORT! I WASN‚ÄôT GIVEN COMFORT THATS THE LOWEST I‚ÄôVE FELT IN MY LIFE!

&#x200B;

i can‚Äôt stop remembering it now.. feels like i‚Äôm back on the classroom floor crying emotionally.. though i‚Äôm aware of being at home.. i‚Äôm scared to go to college,, please i just want it to go right this time..

"In a world where strength should shield and guide,
A question lingers, hard to confide.
Where do these men find audacity's hold,
Assaulting women, hearts left cold?

With trembling hands, I gather words to say,
To shed light on darkness, to stand and portray,
The pain woven deep, scars etched within,
A shared truth of countless minds that's been.

In every corner, a story unfolds,
Of shattered innocence and dreams untold.
How can one possess such cruel temerity,
To inflict wounds upon another's purity?

Women, resilient, brave, and strong,
Endure the unthinkable, battles lasting long.
Their voices stronger than echoes of disgrace,
Resounding through time, demanding a just space.

We ponder, perplexed, in this mystifying maze,
Where empathy should flourish, in compassion's rays.
Yet some hearts turn blind, deaf to their pleas,
Leaving scars unseen, wounding with ease.

Every time I leave my house I put on a show for an audience that doesn't exist and the only time I don't wear a mask is when the credits roll as i lay down each night. The mask isn't one of trauma, or denial. It's much worse. It is a mask of acceptance. I pretend to be the person I used to be to continue long standing friendships without turbulence. I wonder if this is what drove me to delusional disorder, and if it continues; will it drive me to schizophrenia? In the end we all die anyway, so does my mask staying secure really hurt anyone? Especially since I can hardly feel myself to begin with?	Inevitable-Newt4713	post	17.06288975457416	male	White	0.9983662962913513	na	na	na	3	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

If it is being honest about struggeling, be prepeared for ppl having a unhelpfull reaction or even a triggering on. Most ppl arr realy bad at handeling ppl not doing well. Thats why we invented payed proffessionals to turn to when we need help. As a society thats peretty sad.

I was just present and the things and people around me weren‚Äôt real. 

I sought help when someone close to me told me the way I was feeling wasn‚Äôt normal. I had underlining medical conditions that played a big role in how I was feeling and I actually was deeply depressed. I started getting treatment for my medical condition, started antidepressants, and cut alcohol out completely.

"I have been estranged from my father for several years now. I broke with him as soon as I reached full independence, because he was abusive throughout my childhood to me and my mother in many ways. But there is one thing I don't know and  I need to talk to him about it. My mother fought with him over it when it first happened, but she didn't press charges and he and I have never discussed it in my entire life. He does not know that it's one of the reasons why I left. He may have assaulted me in my sleep as a child. I want to ask him whether he did. This may seem completely foolish, because if it's true then he will just lie, but I want to hear his side of the story regardless. Maybe there will be some hint of proof in it or maybe he will admit everything. My memories around the event are extremely confused. My mother is a severely mentally ill person in her own right (possibly schizophrenia or OCD) and not a reliable narrator. And she was not there. He is the only person alive who might possibly know for sure what happened. It eats away at me every day that I have never just asked him about that night, never told him how this uncertainty has affected me, and never heard any kind of answer from him. The possibility that he will admit to it and apologize is miniscule, but it would change my life forever if he did. I truly want to forgive him, and I truly, truly need to ask him why he would do this to me in the first place if he did.

I've told my mother that I'm going to reach out and ask him. She is very very angry with me because she believes he will find us and kill us. He is a somewhat violent person, but to my knowledge he has never killed anyone. I'm taking precautions to meet him in a far away location, in a public park (within sight of many people but out of hearing range so we can talk freely), and I'm not going alone, but that's the best I can do. I can't NOT do this. My mind is wrecked. I've been to so much therapy, I've been away from him for years. It didn't fix the problem. I'm still obsessed with figuring out what happened. I still feel guilty that I never gave him a chance to speak. I'm still acting out in every aspect of my life - emotionally, socially, financially, sexually, and I don't even fully understand the events that messed me up. I can't go on this way.

Please tell me if I'm killing my mother. She really thinks I'm going to get her killed, and she is treating it as if I'm killing her personally. ""Why would you do this?"" that's what she asked me, in a very hurt way. I want to say, ""How could I NOT do this? Why did you keep me from speaking about this for so long? Why did you keep living with him after you believed that he had assaulted me? How am I in the wrong for wanting some clarity?"" But I know it's risky. Maybe I really am killing her by angering him. I am fucking confused. Please, if you can, help me think clearly."	littlegoldrose	post	24.235789815510774	female	White	0.006825748365372419	na	na	na	5	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"I guess what I'd say is that it's important not to get attached to the possibility that he'll see the light and give you the closure you want with an apology. It's very likely not the case. Prepare for what you'll do if you get absolutely none of the kind of response that you want from talking to him (or even worse, if talking to him is only frustrating and invalidating and gaslighting) ‚Äî can you accept that outcome?

I think sitting with this question will help free you up some more to choose whether to really go through with this, rather than feeling like you MUST do it.

If you do go through with it, I would go to some lengths to make sure he hasn't followed you, had you followed, or placed a tracker on you/your car/your friend as you leave.

And I do think this does sound like a risky situation; I personally wouldn't do it, but I'm not you. I think the risk is unlikely to come with you getting what you want.

I would also consider whether you can get some kind of closure through talking to other people about it, instead. There might be a way."	littlegoldrose	reply	na	na	na	0.006825748365372419	weak	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"Thank you very much for your reply. I do think that what you describe is the most likely outcome. If I'm honest with myself, I think that response would still be freeing, because at least I've tried everything. But it would be freeing in the sense that, ""I've tried everything - now I can give up."" I feel very close to giving up on the idea of living a happy or worthwhile life. This doesn't necessarily mean suicide, because I have other people to think about, but I'm very tired. I'm tired of trying new treatments, pursuing goals, saying, ""This will be the thing that fixes me! This time it will all work out!"" And I can't really think of much else that I would try after this point. My mother won't talk to me about it except to say that she thinks he did it but it was years ago and I should get over it. Therapy has helped some symptoms, but hasn't fixed the problem. Maybe I could try medication, but that doesn't seem like a genuine fix either - it's no better than getting high, and that didn't work out well. Numbing out my mood doesn't change what happened or what I think about it.

Reading that back, it does sound like I'm doing this out of desperation. And I will probably need a lot of support afterwards. But I truly still feel like I must do it. It feels like I don't even have a choice - although I know consciously that I do. I don't know. I'll continue to think about it for another day before messaging him. I appreciate your advice.

"Yeah, fair. Honestly the next best options that come to mind are things like ""do ketamine therapy or psychedelics about it"" or something, which are their own big thing that aren't for everyone/every kind of problem. I'm sorry your mom has been so unsupportive about it; ""get over it"" is just about the worst help she could offer.

Something else that came to mind: I would really want to be prepared for him to possibly try to get closer relationship-wise (eg get more contact info, try to visit later, something like that), and I'd want to be prepared for how I would maintain my boundaries in the face of that and ensure that this interaction is the last one.

And I'd plan for how I end the interaction ‚Äî¬†how to leave, how to insist that he leave, what the friend will do if you get overwhelmed, etc"	littlegoldrose	reply	na	na	na	0.006825748365372419	strong	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

My mom and I actually talked more today, and she apologized. She isn't so angry with me now, she just got scared yesterday and lashed out.

I‚Äôve recently started taking contrast showers and whenever I‚Äôm using the cold water, I get very emotional. Sometimes it feels like I might start hysterically crying and laughing at the same times and others like I may have a full emotional breakdown.

"Ok, please no judgement. My relationship is ending. It is a long term relationship of 10+ years (not married, US based) and we share a toddler. We both love each dearly however, after identifying as bi for years I am coming out as lesbian. This has been a process that still involves therapy. 

I am looking for all the skills and resources I can find. I struggle big time with emotional regulation as I have ADHD. I also struggle badly with anxiety attacks and I am working through codependency.

"Long time anxiety sufferer here. I have 3 pronged approach to anxiety. 

Short term: exercise if you can - cardio is my first line, pranic breathing with a normal breath in between cycles. L-theanine and finally medication if it‚Äôs a crisis but should be last line of defence because you‚Äôll become dependant. 

Medium: meditation. This works best if you do it daily. Lowers your baseline stress level and I like to think of anxiety as what you get when stress gets past 100%. I used to do guided meditation but now use pranic here too. Focusing on feeling first then letting go of any feelings I‚Äôm trying to stuff down. I used to think this was all BS but yeah really helps. 10min a day. also eating healthy helps a lot. Drop refined / processed anything (especially sugars) and obviously drop caffeine as low as you can. Anything that upsets your stomach (stomach - brain connection is significant) 

Long term: work on changing your thinking. Meditation helps with this. Trying to get to a point where you care less about things. The Tao Te Ching helped with this, specifically the parts about non-resistance and also stoicism (start with Ryan holiday‚Äôs books) 

Emotional regulation im less of an expert in. But I find that in pranic release stuff seems to have been helping here too. I try and really feel whatever emotion I‚Äôm battling with, let it take over then let it out.

"Hello. I'm a 36 year old man.

I have two sisters, both much older than me, and a mother. My father was killed in a car accident that we were all in when I was 14 months old. 

I was sitting on my mothers lap when two drunk drivers crashed into us. The steering wheel crushed my father's chest, one sister was conscious for it all (she developed severe mental health issues, unsurprisingly), one passed out, my mum had many bones broken and I was technically dead on her lap. A passing doctor saved me. My mum heard her husband takes his last breath and hasn't re-married and even dated again.

Growing up, my eldest sister was very vocally abusive. Never physical. I would constantly be on the edge and mum would always be crying every night. 

I became the person who would do anything to make her smile and laugh and so that has become part of my personality. The caretaker. I have a great relationship with my sister now. But much of that I think is the reason I can never stand up for myself in relationships or work.

I don't know why but my sister once told me that after the crash, my mum used to cry and take me with her into the garage and sit in the car with me on her lap and turn on the exhaust with all the windows closed. My sisters would have to bang at the door until she stopped.

I never registered it properly at the time but I think that has become my deepest trauma. Knowing that my mum went through that and was so desperate she was willing to take me with her because she couldn't stand the thought of no one caring for me. She's the sweetest person in the world. I never tell anyone because I can't even stand the thought of someone thinking she was a bad mum. It was the drunk drivers fault. Nothing more.

\---

I've had my heart broken badly by a friend start of this year. We were really getting along last year and talked almost everyday for 8 months. Things started to feel good and I felt safe, I felt like even if nothing here happens romantically I have a really good friend I can feel safe around that really understands me. We were on the same page about most things. An uncanny amount in common.

Then she just stopped replying. Muted me on IG (not blocked) and when she did reply it was really cold. I haven't messaged her in months, but I type out something every night just 'hey want to catch up?"". I'm so scared to send it because I'm scared of how bad the cold shoulder makes me feel. My therapist thinks I should message her (there was nothing that ended badly or anything, I literally don't know what went wrong) but I'm so scared. I need closure.

I got so upset that my depression came back. I was scared because I knew that if I sank further then what would come up is the suicide thing. And it has. So I started using weed every night to distract myself and I've gotten high every night for the past 3 months. I can't stop.

&#x200B;

I live with 3 others. 1 of them is friends with the girl mentioned above. She doesn't know that I'm mostly upset over her. 

&#x200B;

I love my housemates. I don't want them to feel like I've gone all weird and get scared or anything. Do you think it's a good idea to explain the above to them? Without the girl part because my HM who is her friend is a massive gossip.

Edit:  you should also consider that you were potentially using this friend as some sort of idk coping mechanism for your past trauma.  Perhaps she wanted something romantic and you never made a move?? 8 months is a long time.

"IMO If you mention anything just keep it low fidelity. ‚ÄúSorry guys just been getting smashed by a bit of depression lately‚Äù would be how I personally would go about it. They don‚Äôt need to know the details nor do they have the skill set / awareness to even be able to know how to take it let alone do anything positive with the info. 

Re the girl. There could be almost literally infinite number of reasons why that happened, happens to the best of us. I‚Äôve had some f**king weird and out there ones (verified as true) the solution is to not be hung up on one girl. Download some apps and start talking to 3 or 4 at once and then you‚Äôll never have this problem. 

If you‚Äôre not the most attractive bloke for dating apps, head on over to some of the subreddits here but the main gist of it is: hit the gym, eat healthy, dress better and get a haircut. Name of the game here is self improvement. Being guys at this age we actually have the upper hand for the first time as we‚Äôre in our prime which is nice. I‚Äôve heard that nearly any guy can get to at least a 7/10 by doing the above things and I‚Äôd believe that

(you can even use this aforementioned girl as fuel to try and become someone that she thinks ‚Äúdamn I was such an idiot for blowing him off‚Äù)

"I'm not sure if this is the sort of thing you're asking about, but I have a physical object that gives me strength: A necklace with a pendant of a tiger carved out of tiger's eye. It's very personally meaningful to me and it's helped to provide me with strength in some of my most difficult times. Being jewelry, it's discreet and portable, so I can touch it for reassurance in almost any situation. I keep it next to me as I sleep too, so it can help ground me after nightmares. 

I'm very grateful for the pendant as it's certainly improved my life to feel I can draw upon an outside source of strength like this. I know that ultimately it's my own strength, just symbolically represented, but that distancing helps it be immensely more effective for me.

Again, I don't know if it's exactly what you're looking for, but a close friend of mine feels something similar about her houseplants. They provide her with reminders that her life has meaning and sometimes their mere existence can give her the strength to go on with her own. I agree that it's extremely individual what a person might view as a source of strength, and I wish you the best in finding one that resonates with you."

I can‚Äôt make a decision and it‚Äôs killing me. Normally I‚Äôd go to my parents house and discuss it with my sister since she‚Äôs the one helping me. But I can‚Äôt because my dad is in a foul mood and I‚Äôm taking my kids around that. On the one hand we have a garage that‚Äôs near by. But I‚Äôm not familiar with it and last time I got my car worked on in that town the work was shoddy. We also don‚Äôt have any prices for that place. I have a very tight budget. But my dad says that it‚Äôs probably more than just my tires needing to be replaced. He won‚Äôt look at it himself though. On the other hand we have a garage in the next town over. I‚Äôve already booked an appointment there before my dad mentioned the other place. They can do everything I know I need (tires alignment oil) for 1/3 of my budget leaving wiggle room for anything else that might be wrong. But my dad doesn‚Äôt think my car will make it to that garage. I don‚Äôt know what to do and it‚Äôs killing me. This decision is paralyzing me. I can‚Äôt do anything else until I r made up my mind.	breezeboo	post	16.87147872914058	male	White	0.9987799525260925	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"I am a gay man. The first time I remember catfishing was when I was prepubescent (probably age 10-12). I‚Äôd call into those sex chat lines of the ‚Äò90s and because my voice sounded feminine, I could trick men into having sexual conversations with me. 

Trauma Warning: 
As an 8-year old child, I was groomed and long-term molested by an older male relative (not my father). At the same time, I was being physically and emotionally abused almost daily by my dad. It got so bad once that I was temporarily removed from my home and placed into foster care as a teen. The last time I remember him hitting me was when I was 24. My mom was not in the daily picture, but was, and still is to this day, a drug addict. Stints in jail, disappearing for months, bailing on plans, engaging in sex work, these were all normal for her. When I was college-aged, I drunkenly went to the home of a guy that I shouldn‚Äôt have. I was trying to get over a breakup, and as soon as I got there I regretted it. When I changed my mind, he did not. And the more I said stop or tried to push him off the angrier he got. The rape sent me to the hospital. A year later, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I give you this background, not to seek sympathy, but for context. 

Today, I‚Äôm an adult, have a steady job, a boyfriend, a great friend group. Even though I‚Äôve been working on it in therapy for over three years, I still can‚Äôt stop catfishing. It consumes so much of my time and thoughts. I‚Äôve tried going cold turkey and I‚Äôve tried reducing the amount in increments. I haven‚Äôt found any long term success. 

I feel like most of the instances of catfishes that I‚Äôve seen have been people who might not have romantic, social, or sexual partners. That‚Äôs not my case. Finding friends, boyfriends or sexual partners has never been difficult for me. But still, catfishing consumes me. I use dating apps and social media apps to find guys to solicit nudes from, and then masturbate to them. If I meet an attractive guy, in almost any setting, gay or straight, my first thought will likely be to catfish him. And get this, I‚Äôve even catfished people that I was currently or formerly sleeping with, or already exchanging nudes with as myself. 

I am not proud of this. I‚Äôm desperate to stop. I know it‚Äôs wrong and I‚Äôm ashamed of the behavior, and even makes me feel suicidal at times.  It feels like all of my past trauma is showing up in the worst possible way. A way that I have not figured out how to untangle or overcome.  

If folks have ideas on what might be at the root of this, or how I can stop, I would be forever grateful. Behavioral therapies, treatments, behavioral addiction tips, mental health centers, etc. You can comment below or share them with me via DM."

"Hi everyone, I‚Äôve kinda gotten a little stuck in my self work. I am a trauma survivor who‚Äôs only just begun to understand the complexities of my condition and how much it has impacted my life in every facet imaginable. 

I have only just become more aware of my triggers and how often I get triggered. I am also just learning of the nuances of my triggered state. It‚Äôs exhausting. When I am triggered, I am in that state for ages. Sometimes days even. 

I‚Äôve tried everything to calm myself down, from breathing exercises, vagus nerve stuff, pretty much everything I can think of. But nothing works. Does anyone here have any advice for me to bring myself out from a triggered state quickly and efficiently?

"My story might not be as bad as a lot of peoples here but i really need help on how to face my mother.

I recently got in a really big argument with my mom and its as if im back to being my child self again when i was really scared of her. I never saw her as a mother figure growing up and home was never a safe place for me since i was raised by my grandmother from birth to when i was 4 years old and every time i was sent back home to see my parents during those years i would be yelled at for literally just missing my grandmother. And when i was sent back home to be taken care of by my parents they were rarely there too, i would be staying at an after school care until 6pm everyday because both of my parents have work and they dont have time to take care of me. The only times i would see her is the few hours i get when i get home before i go to bed. And of course the yelling never stopped either, we would get in crazy fights even as a child and she would call me all sorts of things including ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù (which i think is ironic) ‚Äúugly‚Äù and ‚Äústupid‚Äù. And this aint even all of it.

It only started getting better as i entered teenagehood, i was able to reconcile with her. i stopped fearing her, and for the first time in my life i actually felt at home in my own house. But that stopped last week when i got in an argument with her. Granted i was crying and screaming the night before making it so she couldnt sleep but she blew up on me for i wasnt happy putting my laundry back in my closet. The reason i havent done it was because were moving and weve started boxing everything up and all of them was put in my room, i wasnt able to access my closet unless i move them out of the way. so i got irritated, spun my small plastic drawer that was facing away from me on top of the boxes so i could access it and it made a loud noise hitting the wall. And thats when she came and blew up on me. 

Im not saying shes wrong, i get where shes coming from especially with the way ive been dealing with my emotions recently. Ive stopped smoking, self harming and being destructive in general and i really dont know what else i can turn to if i stop crying. Its been hard trying to refrain from everything. But now whats worse is all the things ive felt for her as a child is back, im anxious in my own home, and i genuinely, genuinely never want to see or talk to my mother again. Call  me petty.

"My BF (26)  had a very traumatizing childhood. I don't want to get into too much detail because it's not mine to tell. But he grew up with a very emotionally, and verbally abusive, and neglectful mom. Straight up gaslighting narcissist. And I just experienced it second hand tonight. His sibling still lives with her and they got into it while we were on the phone with him and it made me feel sick. For my BF it was a really big trigger and I felt awful, this is a man that doesn't cry. He did. Anyways the question I'm getting at here is, what are some fun exercises/activities I can plan for us to do on a makeshift date night to help him heal/connect with his inner child? Any suggestions are thoroughly appreciated!!

And before anyone says anything he's already done extensive therapy"	Illustrious-Fig4172	post	24.415192051213204	female	White	0.01024264469742775	na	na	na	5	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

So, I intentionally trust everyone and then get used and disrespected and wonder why. I will let people do things to me that I feel are fucked up just to feel humiliated. Because I think they will like me more... I have allowed my friend to use me and just realized how weak and fucked up I am for that. I hate knowing I don't matter to people, not even after allowing them to hurt me. I am doing cbt but I can't change my self image and lack of boundaries with these exercises.

"I used to feel like I let people walk all over me. You need to sit with yourself and figure out your boundaries, write them down. things you absolutely will not put up with for sake of your well-being. You need to establish those for yourself before you can establish them with other people. when you are confident people will respect you more. This isn‚Äôt an overnight fix-all, but it is a starting point if you need some guidance! 

For me, I will not put up with disrespect of any kind. If someone says something rude to me I‚Äôll simply ask, ‚Äúare you ok?‚Äù It establishes dominance, or in the very least, I‚Äôm not one to be messed with. If they continue being snarky plain and simple I‚Äôll tell them ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt allow people to speak to me this way‚Äù and just walk away. (If your unable to walk away from a situation at school / work, or they won‚Äôt leave you alone then that is harassment. ‚ÄúYou are now harassing me, leave me alone‚Äù) It shows not only dominance but 1) I‚Äôm not going to participate in petty arguments I have better things to do 2) I have confidence in myself 3) I am not worried about anyone else‚Äôs feelings by my own.

"If you look at my profile, you'll see the full story of my trauma.

TDLR: My mother forced me to play with my (stillborn at 9mo) dead baby sister for a full day, telling me it was my fault she died. 

There's so many aspects to this in terms of how she made me suffer. She put photos around the house of my dead sister so I wouldn't forget what I did. 

Her funeral song ""somewhere over the rainbow"" was played every morning on my way to school and she mocked me for crying before school every day.

She refused to get me clothes as I grew, I went to school with holes in my shoes where you could see my toes. 

No coat in the freezing cold UK winter.

Made me stand in the garden facing away from her as punishment for trying to dance with her when I saw her dancing in the kitchen (she continued as I faced away.)

Would make me go without meat because it's ""expensive"" but eat it in front of me.

She'd buy gifts for other kids birthdays that she knew I wanted and make me wrap them while sad they weren't for me - I always got the opposite of what I wanted, intentionally.

She even intentionally bought me trainers in colours she knew I hated but they were nikes and I never had branded shoes before, they were so comfy! But we were the same size at that point and she told me since I don't like the colours, she will keep them since they're her favourite (obviously)

It was cruel, this is just a smidgeon of what happened.

I'm now struggling every day with cPTSD from her abuse. I don't have any connection with my family, I'm completely alone.

I'm a good writer - I'm aware this post is a bit all over the place, but remembering the trauma makes me feel like I'm writing drunk. My brain gets overwhelmed with emotion - just getting the basic outline is enough to start with.

My question is - I'm sorry it took so long to get to this point - what format would you reccomend my book to be in? Is it worth even writing about? 

I have so many memories and thoughts about what happened, I just don't know how to make it a cohesive story with a start beginning and end. 

I'd appreciate if you read my original post on my profile about my trauma so you can understand exactly what I mean by the experience. 

Many thanks!"	oolong_lady	post	24.93756247568003	male	White	0.008450595661997795	na	na	na	9	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

In a similar situation myself, a decent writer and wanting to do it for catharsis and to potentially help others. My abuse was CSA trafficking and it‚Äôs pretty graphic. I‚Äôm taking this approach: write it as if no one would read it, tell your story, get everything out that you need to.

"I‚Äôm 30, and I have a strong level of resentment towards my parents that I would like to put behind me. Need advice. 

I was very badly bullied in my last high school, it was an all boys school, and I told my parents about it a lot in the first year, but my Dad would say it was my fault, and my Mum would say I was an easy target and I had been bullied at every school I went to. 

I went to a lot of different schools growing up but stayed at the all boys school for GCSE and A-level. I was effeminate, gay, shy and very skinny. I was also ill and undiagnosed at the time (my parents thought it was teenage laziness) 

The bullying at the all boys school was 100x worse than anything I‚Äôd experienced anywhere else, and I had enough experience of different schools to know that I could be quite popular in a mixed comp because I got on with girls and was funny and kind. 

Some of the bullying was really violent, a lot of it was incredibly degrading, some of it was sexual. Three of the lads who bullied me in school later beat me up a few months after I came out as gay, and then sodomised me with a stick, it was so bad I needed to be hospitalised. 

Strangely, I don‚Äôt resent the guys who bullied me at school much anymore. It was a toxic environment where homophobia was almost encouraged, conservative values were promoted and a ‚Äúboys will be boys‚Äù attitude meant that bullying and SA against girls at the other schools thrived. 

But I really resent my parents. They were adults and I tried to make them realise the gravity of the situation so many times. Each time they shamed me and made me feel like they thought I was asking for it. 

I struggle to look past this, even though apart from when I think about my parents, I never think of this part of my life at all. When I left home I closed the chapter on all of that and I‚Äôve never looked back. 

But I can‚Äôt separate this trauma from my resentment to my parents. The older I get the worse the betrayal feels. Like they could have allowed me to move schools. They could have said they‚Äôd support me with it. 

They still stand by their decision to send me there. It makes me resent them so much, it makes me feel like I don‚Äôt love or like them anymore."	MoorExplorer	post	10.953375632194419	male	White	0.993311882019043	na	na	na	3	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

This. Tbh the concept of letting go of a feeling, one that we judge as bad, is kind of... Irrelevant? I think it makes more sense to dive in deep on the feeling, explore, poke around, investigate, grieve, scream, cry, whatever you feel you need regarding that emotion. Resentment isn't bad, it just is, and it might help to give it space rather than try to push it away.	MoorExplorer	reply	na	na	na	0.993311882019043	no	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"So last year I had an accident. I fell and suffered an extreme knee injury that has left me partially paralysed and unable to fully use my right leg. It was a lot... It was what you would call a dashboard injury, with very low chance of recovering feeling. I was *very* lucky to get some back, but it's hard. I was diagnosed with PTSD from my accident, and the feeling of falling, the sight of blood, ambulance sirens, and a few other less relevant things give me flashbacks and I'm still struggling.

My family and friends have had mixed responses to my issues. My siblings became jealous of the attention I got, and my parents keep telling me how ""lucky I am"" to have recovered at all. It just makes me upset that people keep talking about how good the accident was for me. On the other hand, while I was in a wheelchair, people would be incredibly ableist towards me, and it added to my problems. I want to move on, but it's hard when people keep talking about it.

"From the point I became seriously traumatized first, I‚Äôve been stuck living in the past. At 12, I‚Äôd repeat the things that were said to me at 10 and 11 while SH‚Äôing. At 13, I was stuck reliving and remembering the abuse that I received from an incredibly possessive and obsessive ‚Äòfriend‚Äô who threatened my life and threatened to take his own because of me. At 14, I was stuck with the eating disorder I got at 13. At 15, I‚Äôm stuck reliving all of these and no matter how hard I try I just cannot focus on the present. It‚Äôs so pathetic. I‚Äôve tried to hard to just get over all of this, get over the people, get over the words, get over the trauma, but something is so wrong with me that I just can‚Äôt. 

I feel so trapped and I can‚Äôt leave my house and I don‚Äôt trust my parents knowing how much I hurt, especially considering that I‚Äôm not the child with issues.

"First time posting in this group however feeling called to share more in new places to support more people 

After a couple decades of being on my own healing journey from experiencing sexual abuse, a narcissistic parent, emotionally unavailable parents and more in childhood I began to find modalities and practices that truly helped me 

I was so tired of repeating patterns especially in relationships- i kept finding myself with abusive partners and scary life situations so when I finally
Landed on things that really changed my
Life i felt this call to begin training and learning so i could help others 

And as a result I felt convicted to shift from being a full time artist to becoming a somatic coach and practitioner and really dive into helping others heal and transform their lives from the inside out 

One of the first things I go over with new clients is them establishing a daily practice that supports them holistically - mind, body and soul 

This is sooo important because when you are working with someone a practitioner, coach or therapist you may only see them once a week that leaves sooo many other days and time on the clock 

One session a week can only do so much 

However you can speed up your results through incorporating a daily practice that supports you daily in being more grounded so when curve balls do come or triggers get activated you have more resource within you so you may not be as reactive as you used to be 

I like to break up a daily practice into a morning and bedtime routine 

A morning routine to set your day off on the right tone grounded, centered and connected with an intention of who you will be (beingness) 

A bedtime routine to clear away anything that happened during the day so you aren‚Äôt going to bed and marinating in that and bringing that into the next day with you - this is also a great time to reflect on any small wins for the day and celebrate them or focus on things you are grateful for 

I actually created a training on this as well as a worksheet if you‚Äôre wanting to get the exact routines I share with clients 

Just send me a DM on my IG and I‚Äôll send it to you ! @c_love_lambert

Or if you have any questions shoot me a message -

Everyone including my family and friends think that me flinching and having intimacy issues is quite overboard in comparison to the single traumatic event I experienced three years ago and they think I should have moved on till now and saying that I get flashbacks and nightmares of that night make them feel that I am overreacting and doing it for attention I know it is important to move on from the past and have a sense of future but the past resides in me and when I told this to my bestfriend she said this is my excuse to everything nowadays I know she wasn't trying to be harsh and just wanted me to cope up but it hit me that maybe I am an attention seeker and my trauma is the only thing that can get it for me that's why it's impossible for me to let go it of but I do not flinch because I like to I do not do any of it because I like it it's just how it has been since forever now how do I change it ?	arcane2305	post	28.107049925852834	male	White	0.994544506072998	na	na	na	5	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"Every now and then I feel myself become attached to the idea of contacting my abusive Ex partner and befriending them. 

Although I know that they fucked me up  on the surface, when I‚Äôm lonely my brain wishes to look back with rose coloured glasses and convince me that there‚Äôs a chance that contact could be good even though I know that that would be the worst thing for me (especially considering we haven‚Äôt spoken in a year and a half and I‚Äôve been trying to heal). 

It‚Äôs especially difficult as unfortunately we live in the same town and if I accidentally see him in public it always seems like he‚Äôs doing better than me and it hit me hard when I was replaced immediately with someone else.

"My abuser was my brother, and occasionally I find myself reminiscing about times that didn't suck, and wanting to talk to him. 
I have to remind myself that the things I'm remembering are 1/1000 moments. Golden memories on a pedestal that don't accurately represent our relationship or his behavior. 

It helps me to have my partner remind me how angry and sad I would get after spending time with him.

"CW: childhood trauma; sexual abuse???

I‚Äôm sorry, I created this account because I just need to find a place to just let some stuff out, I don‚Äôt know where else to go right now.  I found this subreddit and thought maybe I could post here.

I don‚Äôt know what flair to use. I‚Äôm sorry. 

I‚Äôll delete all of this if I need to.

I‚Äôll start this off by saying I never had that many memories of my childhood, and if I did it was only good memories, so I never thought I had any trauma. That is, until the time when I was in college (18-21 years old, I am currently in my thirties), I had my first boyfriend. 

Some context.. I was bad at initiating affection and when he would offer to do anything that my friends said was romantic, I burst into tears and begged him to stop. 

Example: he wanted to treat me to a bubble bath and play guitar for me. I got weirded out, felt sick at the idea, and sobbed hysterically and begged him not to. My friends said I was weird. I felt weird. 

We had been together for a year and we hadn‚Äôt slept together/been physically intimate. I had never slept with anyone prior. When we finally did, I barely remember it. And then one day he offered to perform oral on me.. I didn‚Äôt know want to but he reassured me it would be good.

It‚Äôs still hard for me to gather these memories, but I remember suddenly feeling sick to my stomach, I felt shaky, I started crying, and then I felt like I sunk into a dream where I was in a big bed and there was a man on top of me. He was bigger than me and I couldn‚Äôt see his face. His beard scratched my legs. It was too dark. 

And then I was back with my boyfriend, curled into a ball half naked and shakily crying. 

This happened almost every time I was intimate with someone for years, especially if they were performing orally.. 

I had two boyfriends after my first and they both said I had childhood trauma, that my ‚Äúdreams‚Äù were memories, that no one just has ‚Äúdreams‚Äù of being a child and being hurt. 

I finally told my parents about these vague memories and dreams that I have that just appeared in my twenties and won‚Äôt go away. They were in shock, but my mother said she told my siblings.. and they all agreed upon who they think it was. 

I didn‚Äôt want to know. I just wanted to stop having these ‚Äúmemories.‚Äù

My current boyfriend is the first and only person that didn‚Äôt get angry with me for needing to stop being intimate because I felt a ‚Äúmemory‚Äù coming back, that sick feeling that made me shake and cry. He‚Äôs patient and kind and supportive. And through his support over the years, I haven‚Äôt felt that memory come back in a while. 

I feel like it never actually happened, and my family pretends I never said anything. The only person that recognizes it‚Äôs a thing is my boyfriend, and supports me in many ways. 

Is it common to feel almost disconnected after years of remembering this memory as if I were experiencing it in the moment? Does this mean I‚Äôm ‚Äúover‚Äù it?

Sometimes I‚Äôll still feel icky, I still can‚Äôt watch sex scenes in movies, but i can be intimate with my boyfriend without crying and I can enjoy it.. 

I don‚Äôt know if I should just let myself move on or if I need to be processing through anything more. 

I saw a therapist a while ago and he didn‚Äôt talk about that with me other than when I told my parents in a session.

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm expecting from posting here.. maybe I‚Äôm just nuts and should shut my mouth and delete this. 

Any kind words or advice is appreciated.."	lostpurpletiger	post	21.021815031913597	female	White	0.9956079125404358	na	na	na	6	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"That‚Äôs very validating.. to know someone has a similar story to mine. I just feel insane sometimes.. that this memory appeared suddenly in my twenties and only at ‚Äúconvenient‚Äù times.. which doesn‚Äôt seem convenient, at all, but my ex would tell me that I was using my trauma to get out of sex, and said it was so ‚Äúconvenient‚Äù that I triggered when he wanted sex.. but I know I never controlled it.. but now with my current bf I rarely ‚Äútrigger‚Äù so it feels like maybe I was lying or something.. but I try so hard to tell myself that my boyfriend is so supportive that the reason I don‚Äôt trigger as much is because he doesn‚Äôt force me to do anything, he listens to me when I consent and when I don‚Äôt.. 

I remember I triggered into these.. I guess ‚Äúflashbacks‚Äù‚Ä¶ whenever my ex would initiate with me and wouldn‚Äôt listen to me if I felt uncomfortable or whatever.. and then as soon as I came out of my memory, he would yell at me and practically destroy my bedroom because he never got what he wanted because of my ‚Äútriggers‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm replying now and I realize what that guy did to me during my most vulnerable period still effects me because I can feel myself shaking.. 

I don‚Äôt know who hurt me when I was a kid. I don‚Äôt have a face in the memory and the memory is more like vivid feelings that hurt. Sometimes I feel like my ex-boyfriend made my trigger worse because he was selfish and abusive.. which I feel like is selfish of ME to say.. 

Like.. it‚Äôs not fair of me to put any blame on the guy because he didn‚Äôt sign up for a broken case.. but at the same time, I know that it‚Äôs not my fault that he reacted to my pain that way. 

Anyway you don‚Äôt have to reply to me.. that was a long ramble and I just wanted to say thank you for the validation. Sorry for going on and on.. I let myself go because I figured it would help me process..

"The flashbacks that I get, which I also can‚Äôt tie back to specific early experiences, got a lot worse for me when I started having sexual experiences I didn‚Äôt want to have as an adult. It sounds like you‚Äôre going through that too, and for whatever it‚Äôs worth, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs uncommon. 

More importantly, in case nobody has told you this lately: It‚Äôs not selfish to want to feel safe. It‚Äôs not selfish to expect your partner to care whether you‚Äôre getting triggered more than he cares about his own immediate pleasure. (It‚Äôs understandable that your ex would have been unhappy about it, but he have should cared enough about you and been a decent enough human to put that aside.) I‚Äôm glad that you‚Äôre with someone now who seems to get that (?), and if that‚Äôs a hard concept to process or accept, it might be a good idea to find a counselor who specializes in trauma work. 

You‚Äôre not a broken case. Everybody has issues. Expecting people to care enough about you to give you grace and love when your problems rear their ugly heads is more than reasonable, especially in a romantic relationship. And your ex failing to do that may be part of the trauma you‚Äôll unpack one day. 

That‚Äôs not to say he‚Äôs a trash person all around. I don‚Äôt know the guy. He might just be a wildly selfish and immature soul who needs to grow the hell up. Maybe he‚Äôll be a decent person in ten years. What I do know is that you don‚Äôt have to be a monster for your choices to hurt someone deeply. And I think his choice to disparage you for your flashbacks and trauma responses was objectively heartless and re-traumatizing.

"One that helped me a lot was Hellblade but it is a rough game and I would do some research before playing it. The games protagonist is a young Pict Barbarian whose entirely clan was taken out by the Norsemen. She suffers from schizophrenia but believes it‚Äôs a curse from the gods.

For me, and some others, they feel a huge emotional release at the end. It made me cry but I felt so good doing it and felt so much lighter for having played. But for another group of people, it‚Äôs difficult to play and can exacerbate symptoms.

"I have a psych background, around 20+ years of informal and formal study mixed. I've been encountering individuals from various professions who claim that there are now ways to heal mental illness and trauma by using VR. This is a technology that already exists. 

The theory is that since the mind cannot tell the difference between reality and VR (because the senses are completely immersed) that can lead to all sorts of healing.

While I'm all for new healing modalities, I'm also skeptical. AFAIK trauma is stored in the parasympathetic nervous system, sense perceptions don't reach there (which is why we have EMDR and brainspotting) Depression and anxiety can have complex pathologies, and I'm unsure at to how effective immersion in an simulated environment could be. 

Of course, I don't know everything, and though I try to keep abreast of recent developments (like video games to treat ADHD, which have FDA approval) I might have missed something. The VR tech might be used as an adjunct and not as a primary healing modality?

"This is going to be a massive oversimplification, but our brains are essentially physical manifestations of our lives experiences. Every new experience links to the old ones through related ideas and concepts. So, using the example of sexual assault two very different areas of the brain connect. Intimacy, pleasure, trust, and vulnerability get connected to pain, fear, betrayal, and disgust. The brain detects a threat that it doesn't know how to react to due to intensity, complexity, or an inability to physically handle the stress of the situation kind of like a computer with way too many tabs open, it kicks on the stress hormones to prepare for a fight and any potential injuries and the nervous system goes crazy intaking as much information as it can about the threat and overloads the brain further when the new information still doesn't provide any safety or security. Once the event is over the brain goes back to searching for the two things it craves most. Safety and certainty. The new event disrupted the security the brain had and until it can figure out why the trauma happened and how to avoid it in the future the brain stays stressed and the nervous system stays in fight or flight. Returning to the example of a sexual assault, everything was fine one moment and then seemingly out of the blue, danger enters your life. Then, just as quickly as it came into your life it's suddenly over, but if it happened once it can always happen again. The situation isn't over until the brain can be sure it won't happen again. A much more manageable example would be falling over and hitting your head as a child learning to walk. The brain figures out how to balance the body and to brace itself with hands so you don't risk getting bonked on the head again. Then, as you develop the skill to keep from injuring yourself by falling over repetition of that acquired skill builds your confidence in your safety. Certainty and safety have been accomplished and the brain no longer registers falling as a major threat. It's unpleasant and you want to avoid it, but your chances of falling and getting significantly hurt are massively diminished. No more need for you to be on edge. Pair that with research into marketing and business and we can start to get an idea of how healing might occur via the use of VR systems. Research shows that for every one negative experience it takes anywhere from 3 to 7 positive experiences to cancel it out. So, if you went to Wendy's and they messed up your order and overcharged you you'd need to receive good service at least 3 times to associate Wendy's with positive thoughts and feelings. If someone insults you once it'll likely take 3-7 compliments to restore or improve your self esteem. Of course, it's safe to assume this would also be affected vastly by the severity of the experience. A stranger insulting your appearance who you think looks like a slob is less likely to have as significant an effect on your self esteem as your own mother insulting your very existence saying she wishes you were never born. Therefore the number of positive experiences to outweigh the insult from your mother is likely to be greater than the number needed for the sloppy stranger. The important key word being ""positive"". If it's neutral or another negative experience you'll have no change or even a negative impact on your view of yourself or the brand. Interactions in reality are messy, unsafe, unpredictable, and potentially even retraumatizing for an already traumatized brain. Speaking to a close talker for instance may not be legitimately dangerous to your health, but to someone who's been assaulted it may feel like a precursor to the same situation playing out again leading to a panic attack or strong trauma responses that could lead to further traumatizing experiences reinforcing the links in the brain between other people and danger. Perfectly normal and safe interaction. Wildly traumatic experience. A VR simulation on the other hand could sound and look real, even respond very realistically to a patient asking questions or talking about their day, and even trick the brain into fully believing the interaction really was real until they remember it's all simulated, but it could be programmed to respond in trauma informed ways building a repertoire of positive experiences with ""human"" interaction to help the brain decide subconsciously that the threat to the patient's safety was really over. Of course, this is purely theoretical and partially based on an unrelated field where the negative experiences are much less consequential, but it does at least make sense in theory that VR could be a valuable tool for reinforcing positive pathways in the brain between everyday tasks and positive outcomes rather than further trauma."

I‚Äôm (26F) not sure if this is the right place to post this. I‚Äôm having an internal dilema and it‚Äôs just occurred to me now that this may have something to do with the childhood trauma I experienced. I was physically and mentally abused by my mother. My father is so kind and caring but he was always at work and didn‚Äôt know how to deal with my narcissistic mother and is not able to deal with confrontation at all. If he took my side it would be worse for him (she‚Äôd throw tantrums/scream at him/give us all the silent treatment for weeks etc) so 99% of the time he was passive in the abuse or wasn‚Äôt around for it. 

I‚Äôm not sure how to write this without sounding weird. Every since I can remember I have been obsessed about the thought of being rescued by a male, in the literal sense. Like from an accident, anything from a faint to a car crash. 

I remember I would go to sleep around age 10 while thinking about ‚Äòif my school burned down would a boy pick me up and save me from the fire‚Äô and I‚Äôd purposely dream about it as I felt satisfaction from that dream. 

Nowadays I watch videos on YouTube where I can find them of paramedics/military/police/mountain rescue/lifeguards etc saving females and get the same metal satisfaction (I say mental so no one gets the wrong idea). I search endlessly and often can‚Äôt find any new videos to watch but the urge of watching it is still there. It‚Äôs like I want to see a male care for a female and lift her up like she is small/weak and helpless just so he can save and protect her with his strength.  I of course would never ever pretend to be in an accident and waste anybody‚Äôs time just for this satisfaction. 

On the flip side I am obsessed with the thought of rescuing others. I have trained in first aid and am always on the look out for others and want to be useful if anything happened to anyone I come in contact with. My sister laughs at me and says I have a ‚Äòsaviour complex‚Äô which is hurtful and says the reason I want to help is so I can get attention in the media if I save someone‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not that at all. I just want to save people. If I wasn‚Äôt doing what I do for work just now I would be a paramedic. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm hyper aware of this kind of thing. I want to be ready to save someone from downing/heart attack/chocking you name it. I remember when I was a child I would fall asleep thinking ‚Äòwhat order would I swim into each room in the house and save my family if our whole city was flooded by the sea‚Äô (this would never happen where I live). I also am quite prepared for accidents. As a child I would imagine my escape route if there was a house fire etc. and as an adult I‚Äôve bought my dad a motorway first aid pack for his car etc. 

I am concerned about these thoughts and can‚Äôt make sense of them. I wondered if anybody here has experienced this or if anyone had any thoughts. I‚Äôm very nervous posting this as I‚Äôve never told anyone and I know it‚Äôs weird."

Hi dear one, you're obsessed and constantly seeking what you should have had. Your biology and physiology is designed to grow up in a safe, nurtured, loving, and peaceful environment. With you experiencing such severe trauma from your mother and then even more trauma from your father doing nothing to protect you, this need never was satisfied and met. You're stuck way back to being a very young child where you should have been held, rescued, told everything would be okay, and then to be removed from that situation to never experience it again. I suggest creating a safe place for yourself to see that little person again so you can be the one to tell her it's okay, because you are okay now. Tell her the end, where you are now, how you survived and how she deserved better. Cry with her, hold her, ask her what she needs (it needs to be a body experience, not a logical thought you run - it needs to be lived out in your body and mind). If this seems unsafe or too far out of your reach, I would suggest finding a counselor who is well trained in trauma therapy including internal family systems. Your body is doing exactly what it needs to survive after such horrible wounds you incurred. Thank yourself tonight, and I hope you feel so proud of how far you've come from all those moments. So much love to you wonderful one. ü©∑	Neverneverland1888	reply	na	na	na	0.007229258771985769	weak	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
I have never had anyone express this before in as many words so I thought I was the only one.

Hello, thank you so much for your this. It made me emotional. This has really helped me understand it. I will try and do some inner child work. I‚Äôm not sure if I can change my obsession but I‚Äôll try as it‚Äôs concerning I think this way. I have a CBT therapists just now but we‚Äôre not looking at trauma and I think this needs addressed first before CBT.

I came to a realization. My mom and I, we left that home for a reason. Everyone was abusive to me and her. Just because my mom is also abusive doesn't mean go back to pure hell. I thought I'd be able to. I can't. I won't. I refuse. So, I might have to go to a shelter instead. I'd rather be there than ever go back to that home. My repressed memories are coming back and I am seeing things in a new perspective. So yeah.

"I want to tell this story because I have the feeling that talking helps, but I'm scared of talking too much  about it to the people in my real life. I'm actively seeking for ways to cope with this, so please share your suggestions.

It's been four days since someone committed arson on my student residence. I am an RA there and when the fire alarm went off, I went checking where it came from and walked in on a whole room on fire. I called the fire department and luckily everyone evacuated safely, nobody is harmed and it's only material damage, but it is a lot to process. I've been called a ""hero"" multiple times, but I kinda cringe everytime someone says that to me, because it makes it feel so real. Was I 10 minutes later, the whole wing would be on fire and then people would have been injured/building would have been unliveable. 

The last couple days were a lot. I kept on doing things, because I can't just sit with my thoughts. Every night I have at least one crying session with no real reason. It's quite sudden. Everything I do, the whole situation keeps on playing in my head, and little snippets of things I did and saw and smelled and felt on my skin appear unannounced in my mind. It's still bearable, because it's only day four and I know this is quite normal, but I'm getting tired. I don't sleep very well. No nightmares, just short nights. 

How can I handle this best? What steps should I take? I've been offered psychological help, but I feel it's still too early for that. I have the feeling that I can process this on my own, but for the moment I just don't know how?

"If psychological help is being offered, take it!! I had a similar situation happen - I was also an RA but my school calls them CA for sophomores and up; my situation played out a bit more differently.

Anyway, if you‚Äôve never experienced this type of scenario and you‚Äôre noticing your body reacting and responding differently to your ‚Äúnormal‚Äù/daily routines, listen to it! Our bodies and minds have tremendous and not so tremendous ways of trying to protect and/or communicate with us.

The fact that you‚Äôre scared of talking too much about it with people in your life is a good indicator that you may benefit from speaking about it with a trained professional - ideally someone who is trained in PTSD.  You won‚Äôt have to worry about making any sense of the things you say or rambling on and on; it‚Äôs literally their job to help you make sense and understand what‚Äôs happening and hopefully provide you with some tools to navigate through this trauma.

What you experienced was trauma - a deeply distressing or disturbing experience. Everyone has their own threshold and your bodily reactions/responses may be a signal that your body/mind recognizes the weight of what happened four days ago. 

I recently started seeing a trauma therapist that specializes in EMDR. While i initially sought her out to help me navigate through other traumas that happened a couple years ago, I found myself having  emergency surgery due to my ex primary doctor‚Äôs negligence. I literally had a preexisting appointment with her 3 days after my surgery and it was the best thing that could‚Äôve happened.

The sooner you start processing what happened to when the trauma happened, the better as your body tends to store trauma. 

Am I 100% healed? Heck no, but did it help me process my emotions, thoughts, etc without fear of judgement? Absolutely. 

Not sure how much therapy experience you‚Äôve had but finding a good therapist is also a little like dating - not every therapist will be a good fit. Give it a couple tries and if you don‚Äôt find yourself gaining new tools or perspectives, look for a different therapist. I just want to have that disclaimer because many people, myself included (in the past), turn away from therapy the first go around because it wasn‚Äôt a quick fix. 

I hope you find rest and peace soon."	_Katris	reply	na	na	na	0.013676472008228302	weak	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
I am experiencing a combination of physiological and psychological symptoms resembling those associated with dorsal vagal shutdown. Specifically, I am encountering symptoms such as a dull sensation in my head, reduced alertness, weakness, exercise intolerance, diminished ability to perceive pain and temperature changes, a pervasive feeling of detachment from my body, lack of hunger and thirst, insomnia, and an unresponsiveness to caffeine or other stimulants. I am curious if anyone else has encountered a similar situation and if they have found any specific treatments or therapies that have helped them recover from these symptoms.

"Hello everyone. Sorry if this isn‚Äôt formatted correctly for this sub, it‚Äôs my first time here. 

I had an incident where a close friend of mine was in a very dark place and did some things I wish they didn‚Äôt to their self.  I tried to be there for them every hour of every day because I felt it was my duty. I sometimes was up until 3-4 AM when I had to get up at 6AM just so I could think of ways to help or actively talk to them so nothing happened. I was stressed everyday of the 6months because I was worried I was failing them or causing something to happen or that if i didn‚Äôt stay up I would wake up in the morning with no friend and his mom would have no son. I actually ended up in a pretty not great place myself. 

Now, my friend is in a much better place, with a better mindset and better coping skills which I‚Äôm happy for, but I‚Äôm still stuck there. I get severe anxiety whenever I hear certain words or see certain objects that relate. The anxiety so bad I don‚Äôt function, i sweat, and sometimes even cry. Is this normal? Is there any way to combat it or is it a wait and see what happens? It feels like I‚Äôm teleported right back to where I was in the moment.

I think it‚Äôs a normal response in that it‚Äôs common and understandable, but it isn‚Äôt normal in the sense that you should accept that as your quality of life now.

Im 17 rn. Never been a good kid. Not in my opinion, atleast. Always made huge messes, got in trouble all the time, stayed out too late. Spent like 9 months in foster care when I was 13-14. since I got out, my moms tried to convince me to join a suicide pact with her twice. She insists it didn‚Äôt happen cuz she doesn‚Äôt remember but I remember one instance very vividly. Had a panic attack during dinner and laid down on the ground. Mom was drunk. Instead of comforting me she just sat next to me and said, ‚Äúhey, why don‚Äôt we take a bunch of pills together?‚Äù It hurts to remember. She hates when I try to kill myself but apparently it‚Äôs fine when she tries to kill me. Is it my fault? Do I deserve this for being a bad kid?

In her position and maybe with a little projection as this is relatable to me to some extent.

"Ohhhh, no! No, OP. No it‚Äôs not. You could not have ever done anything, ever, in a million years that would make you deserve this! That your mom is wrapped up in her own hell has nothing to do with you, or how you have acted or what you have said or not said, done or not done.

Many times it‚Äôs not so much that WE are horrible children, but that we have parents who are incapable of being the parents that we actually need them to be!

I don't think I hate the guy that Raped me at all .... at least I don't think I do in anyway....

I tell myself that I don't think I need to Forgive my Rapists at all...(because in my mind... ( I don't Resent them/or am angry at them.)

I believe that I don't need to forgive them because (I don't think I Need to)----Since I think I just instantly Forgive them in my mind...(At least I think so...)

I'm just upset what happened to me!!

Not about the person!!

LIKE I Completely Hate what they did to me!!

But I completely think that I'm Not Mad at my Rapists at all...(like the people I don't feel Anger towards  Not really at All ...... I only Hate the Actions!!)----- Not the Person.

I Know we are Humans and maybe they made a mistake/ or Just Saw me as a Sex Object, instead of a person....( But I'm not anger at them).....


Hope I make sense

I‚Äôm from a town of 12,000 inhabitants in southern Europe. During the ‚Äò90s, I suffered bullying from the age of 7 to 17.
Today, I ran into the person who bullied me the most during my adolescence while I was at a caf√© with my parents (my father is 75, and my mother is 67). He was with friends, his partner, and a newborn baby, and I didn‚Äôt want to do anything, but seeing so much normalcy and happiness for someone who caused so much pain wasn‚Äôt fair. It lasted for over 10 years.

After changing schools, the nightmare continued, but he was the one who started it all and relentlessly focused on me. He also became obsessed with my brother and my parents, and we felt powerless to do anything about it. The reason for his obsession was my overweight.

My parents feel that they didn‚Äôt do enough to protect me from that person. The bullying I endured because of them (him in particular) is impossible to put into words: all sorts of humiliations, threats, insults, and persecutions. I always felt defenseless against them, and they always seemed to win. My parents went to the school and the police, but no one paid attention; they dismissed it as kids‚Äô stuff. My father had been saying for a while that he didn‚Äôt want to die without confronting them. They even insulted my parents in public, calling us mentally unstable. For over 20 years, that person and their group of friends have been keeping tabs on me.

Today at the caf√©, I did something ridiculous. I wrote a note, and my father gave it to this bully. In the note, I expressed that I hope he takes good care of their child because he has already caused too much harm and left too many victims, and no matter how he tries to be a good person now, they have caused pain. 

He confronted my father, and I stood up to him, telling him what I felt inside: that he will always be the terrible person who tried to harm us for over a decade, that he‚Äôs now a teacher, and I will do everything possible to get him fired because people like him shouldn‚Äôt be educating teenagers. He said hurtful things about my family, and his partner even sent me to therapy, which I, of course, did, and he was a significant cause of many problems I faced.

I didn‚Äôt want to bring up the past, but I know my parents felt hurt because he caused us harm, even threatening them when they were heads of the family, and they couldn‚Äôt do anything. It saddened me as a child that a classmate would do that to my parents just because they hated me for being overweight. Another thing that hurt me deeply is knowing that, all these years, I have been a topic of conversation among his friends, and they‚Äôve been keeping tabs on me. One of his friends who works at a supermarket laughed at me, and I got fed up and called her a derogatory term. I know it‚Äôs not the right way to handle it, but I‚Äôm exhausted. 

After all this, I also feel quite sad for still living in the same town where there are people who take an interest in my life despite hating me so much, and I haven‚Äôt done anything to them.

All of this connects with my deepest wounds and the little girl who couldn‚Äôt defend herself, but now I can, and that‚Äôs why I spoke up today. In fact, to prevent further harm, I‚Äôm considering leaving a record with the police and explaining what happened. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a good idea; what do you think? I would leave things as they are, but I‚Äôm afraid for my parents. What goes against me is that we acted foolishly with the note, but he escalated the situation, even though he was the one with a history of bullying."	ellenn89	post	15.908628419759932	female	White	0.9911962747573853	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	ethnicity: southern european, age: 40s, gender: female, explanation: the author mentions being from a small town in southern europe and has experienced bullying for over a decade from the '90s through her adolescence, which would likely put her in her 40s. the post also mentions the author was targeted for being overweight, and her connection and empathy towards her parents suggest she is a female. this, combined with poignant details about their personal life and feelings, suggests that the author is likely a woman.

You're not invalid. We don't get to pick our fear response, and it's not something we can really change either. Your body did what it felt was the best way to protect you. Your lack of fighting served a purpose - to protect you from getting hurt even worse.

"Trigger warnings - context contains details of upsetting experiences, avoid if you'd like to or need to 

&#x200B;

So a bit of long context. I was assaulted as a teenager by someone I trusted and was close to, and the 'friend' who helped put me back together became my husband of 10 years. Throughout those years we had a child, he cheated a lot and I forgave a lot, we tried everything to make it work but ultimately I left when it was revealed he'd been having an 8 year affair. My partner afterwards was verbally and emotionally abusive, but also flipped to the most lovely person too. Eventually it was too much and I left him. 

&#x200B;

Now I've been on my own for 2+ years, and I don't think I'll ever be in a significant or serious relationship again, I've made my peace with the fact that I just cannot trust another person enough to be in that level of openness, vulnerability or lack of control again. This doesn't upset me anymore or cause any problems, I'm quite happy - I have a fulfilling career, a beautiful child, wonderful family and friends, I don't need to open myself up to abuse and torment again.   


But lately I've been finding that my mind won't stop going over the details of what happened through all those years with a different perspective or hindsight and it's killing me. I realised that my ex-husband, who I thought was my friend, helping me after the assault, was 22 when I was 16 the first time we slept together. That I was blackout drunk and crying my eyes out while he was stone cold sober telling me it was fine. I'm replaying all the time I caught him cheating and he would remind me about how he 'fixed' me after the assault so we had to stay together because no one else would understand why I am the way I am, and that the miscarriages we had were the reason he cheated over and over and over. I'm thinking about the way he bought his AP into our lives and tried to convince me to let her live with us and watch our child so they could be closer. 

&#x200B;

I'm thinking about the things my ex used to scream at me at night time, and the way he looked like he hated me whenever I would say I wasn't going to argue with him. I've been having dreams about the time that I wouldn't say a word to him when he came up to bed screaming about Netflix and I just went to bed instead and how angry he got, how scared I was, waking up with my heart pounding out my chest.   


I've been having dreams about the assault and waking up thinking someone is in my house, waiting to get me.   


I'm exhausted and I have no idea why this is happening now? Granted, none of it has ever been properly dealt with, but I have no clue what is triggering all of this now. When my child is away with their dad, I literally cry the whole day uncontrollably, and I don't know if it's a sign that I'm working through the trauma of it all because of the quiet time by myself, or if it's become too much and in those moments I realise how depressed and worthless I feel?   


Please can someone give me some advice here as I don't think I can carry on feeling like this. "	orangeflowers2468	post	24.34875788064945	female	White	0.9740570783615112	na	na	na	3	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"Everything in my life needs to improve dramatically, for sure. I won't lie to myself. Everything could be better. I got prescribed a new medication. It might work, it probably won't, I don't think it will. Even if it does work and it makes me less depressed, taking it won't change any of the things that are actually wrong. It won't change anything that happened to me. I haven't started taking it, I don't know if I will.

I have a hard time explaining this to my therapist/nutritionist/psychiatrist. I know everything could be better. I know there are things I could do that would probably help me. Like if I tried to work on my eating disorder I would probably have better focus and my memory might be better. But I don't think it's worth it. I don't think I have anything worth improving. 

I don't want to make some small improvement that stops me from killing myself long enough for something else traumatic to happen. This happens over and over. I don't have anything that's worth making better. I don't think I'm worth it, full stop. Nothing will ever happen that can justify putting myself through living after what has happened to me, and there's nothing I can do, no broader action I can take, to justify it either. I can't imagine a life where I don't feel like this all the time, I don't think that exists.

I don't know what to do. My nutritionist is really trying to make me do something, she's trying to find some way to motivate me. My therapist is too. I don't know what to tell them if there just isn't one. I don't want to get worse. I don't know what I'm supposed to do now.

"TW: CSA, suicidal toughts, unhealthy coping. Disclaimer that i'm kinda drunk, cause appearantly that's my way to cope.

TLDR on the bottom, but i'm too exhausted to check if it means anything without the massive block of shit i wrote lol. Also, i'm sorry for any spelling mistakes. I just can't...

I'm lost. I tought i was going in circles, being depressed as fuck in spring and summer, and getting just a little better in fall and winter. But this year i realised i'm actually just spiraling down more into depression. Not getting better at all. Every year i get worse a little.

Some backstory: I don't think i can get into the sexual stuff again, i wrote a post before on SAsurvivors subreddit, should be the last post in my post history. I don't even remember how much i wrote, and i really don't want to check it. But basically, I was sexually abused by both of my parents i think. They divorced when i was 2. I visited my father every 2nd week for the weekend, and for 2x 2 weeks in the summer. I actually don't know if i should also count my mother's sexual abuse, because it wasn't as horrible as my father's, and i honestly doubt that that was her intention. I just happen to feel sick and disgusted about the stuff she also did to me. Even if i don't count her actions as sexual abuse, she is still a horrible person, and i still live with her. So that sucks.

I want to get this off my chest: I don't have a lot of memories of my childhood. I only have few small glimpses of memories. And stories that i know from other people. I thought that was normal. That a person can't really recall stuff from pre 15 years old. But i'm just 23, so that wasn't even that long ago. I think everyone i know can tell lot's of stories of their childhood. Except me? I know that my father made me watch porn when i was a child. A therapist figured it out from my drawings and stuff. Later the guy admitted this in front of me and an other person. I don't remember a single thing. I know that i almost dorwned under his care when i was 9. A drain of a pool sucked my hair in and i couldn't get up for air. I can't remember this one either. My mother was suspecting it because of a local news article about a 9 year old in that situation.  And that i wisited a hospital and got to take some meds for a few days. I remember i used to get an uneasy feeling around drains and manhole covers. And the sexual abuse multiple times I REMEMBER from age 13-14, i'm not sure when and how much, i dissociated. And appearantly at some very young age, maybe 5, i told my grandparents (from my fathers side) that my mother is beating me with a rope??? I can't remember. Can't remember at all. I know she sometimes get very angry and get phisical, but i just can't imagine... Did i just make that up? At such a young age? I can't imagine coming up with someting like that. Why would i? And why would she do that? She always told me that i was a very good kid. What the fuck.

And that makes me wonder, why can't i remember so very much from my childhood? Was it that traumatising, was i beaten a lot? Did i just make that all up? Cause i don't think anybody adult did something about ""my confession"", i'm pretty sure i would have taken away, right? Didn't i have some marks on my body? And thank god i guess for not getting taken into my fathers care, right? Because he later definietly sexually abused me. No matter how much i tried to convince myself that it was just some stupid fantasy, I ACTUALLY REMEMBER THAT. It could have been so much worse to live with him. Why can't i remember so damn much? Is it just my memory being extremely bad? It's certainly a possibility. Was i abused more than i remember, and my mind just tries to protect me? Which one of them abused me more? What the hell happened to me? I don't even think i want to know, but i'm also so fucking frustrated. What i know of and what i remember is already so bad... I just want to forget even more? All of it. I don't know what i want. There is a very strong feeling i remember i always had. That i won't live long. That feeling kinda never left.

&#x200B;

A couple of weeks ago i got into a very bad mind space, from some victim blaming that wasn't even directly targeted towards me. My mother and uncle discussing that people who dress a certain way deserves abusive relationships and rape. All that shit because a couple weeks ago my sister got a piercing, colored hair and likes crop tops. But i also have piercing and colored hair. If one person that looks like me deserves any of this, surely we all do. But i was a very varage little girl back then. Did i still deserve it. Surely i did. I did something. It's existence, that's what i did wrong. I never even wanted to be born. I'm still trying to get out of those toughts. I sometimes spiral down this way. But i got into it really bad this time. I couldn't stop thinking about all this shit that i went through, and the stuff that i might can't remember. Now, i just gave up and started drinking. I don't consider myself actually alcoholic, as in addicted to it. I can stop. I don't drink all the time when i feel like shit, i don't have that much money anyway. I can go sober for months. But fuck, if it isn't helping a little. I'm not thinking constantly about that stuff after at least 2 shot, and i can get back to reading, drawing, youtube and social media. It just gives me a little peace. And it's supposed to be bad. But if i don't drink when i'm spiraling down these thoughts, i can do worse. Like thinking about self harm and suicide, having ptsd and flashbacks. Hell, maybe my thoughts might be some fucked up way of mental self harm? I don't know at this point. I want help, but i don't want teraphy again. I had one session at age 19. I was forced to go when i finally told my mum about my SA by my father. And the teraphist was so bad, i hated her. I hate the tought of ever doing any of that again. I honestly think i would rather die. I also feel worse when i talk about it with people i know and care about. I prefer anonimity. And sure, it would be awsome to get the hell out of my mothers care i guess. I have financial problems. But i can't get a job if i can't study. And most of the time it's hard enough to just get out of the damn bed. So i need to get mentally better before i can get mentally better? How does one achieve that?

&#x200B;

In conclusion: There is more, but i'm probably forgetting a lot of the stuff i wanted to share in one go,but oh well, story of my life i guess. I'm tired. I'm sad. Depressed. Suicidal. Angry. I'm fucking mad at myself for not getting better by the time like how i supposed to do. Everyone says it will get better, but it's been a decade already since the physical abuse stopped. I feel guilty. I would literally kill myself if i ever knew if my little stepbrother was sexually abused AFTER ME, because I DIDN'T say anything to anybody FOR FUCKING YEARS. Of course i never went ot the police with any of this shit. Because i'm a fucking selfish coward like that. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Life is shit, got SA, physical and emotional abuse, but i wanna be better. I don't know how to do this by myself without outside support? I'm regretting sharing anything with my friends. It makes me feel uncomfortable, and i also don't want to drop more of this heavy shit on them. What else can i do instead of slowly becoming an actual alcoholic? Am i beyond repair? Anybody got an inspirational story to share? Anyway, i don't really care if i don't get replies or help here. I'm just hoping writing out some of this stuff in a public but anonim enough place will help? IDK. Thanks for reading.

"Your brain is trying to protect you from the trauma you suffered. In childhood the brain learns to be forgetful if you suffer a lot of stress‚Ä¶simultaneously, very negative events are the easiest for us to remember. So it kind of backfires, where you forget a lot of neutral or good memories and are left with the very bad ones.

I have this paranoia that when my health is not great if I go to the doctors they won‚Äôt believe me and either not do anything or prescribe a placebo. It probably comes from women‚Äôs health not being taken seriously as well as my dads very anti doctor attitude. I couldn‚Äôt even tell you the number of times he‚Äôs accidentally cut his finger down to the bone and used super glue to fix it instead of getting stitches. The entire time I‚Äôve been alive I can only remember him going to the doctor once and I don‚Äôt even know what it was for. Kidney stone maybe and my mom had to really work on convincing him to go. I know I need to do better about taking care of myself I just don‚Äôt know how. What if there isn‚Äôt anything actually wrong? What if im seeing a few unrelated things and making them to be something bigger? The problem right now is that type two diabetes runs in my family and my hands/feet are frequently tingly and I‚Äôm fatigued and thirsty. All im going to get told to do is to change my diet anyways. But that damn near impossible living paycheck to paycheck. The cheapest meals are breads and pastas. I barely eat anyways. There‚Äôs a chance that it could just be that my blood circulation has gotten worse (always had a problem there) and my iron is low and I‚Äôm dehydrated more than I thought. Not to mention I have a toddler and an infant at home keeping me up at night. I barely eat anything as is because I‚Äôm making sure the kids can eat. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do but my wife wants me to make myself a doctors appointment. *sigh* I suppose I‚Äôve been meaning to get the circulation thing checked out anyways‚Ä¶	breezeboo	post	25.316114130967016	female	White	0.9982728958129883	na	na	na	2	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

It was very difficult to not vent, and to explain what happened concisely.  


I decided to tell what happened chronologically, to help shine light on the how and to some extent .  It is informed by research on social psychology.

"From ages 3-10, an adult male family member with IDD was sexually inappropriate with me. I didn‚Äôt know how to handle the realization that this was abnormal and abuse in my early adolescence (around 12) when I started learning about the social aspects of sex.
I began acting out, having trouble sleeping, and would have crying spells and SI. I struggled with shame and guilt, but also confusion and compassion regarding the family member, considering he was intellectually disabled, I felt I wasn‚Äôt allowed to be angry with him or blame him, and the one time I tried to tell my mom about it at around 13, she claimed I was just making it up and to stop lying and go to bed.
I began to convince myself it was all in my head and that the images I and sensations I remembered so vividly were some sort of hallucinations due to my apparent insanity. I became much worse and at 14 attempted to take my life. I was hospitalized in an adolescent psychiatric unit, when a psychiatrist (who met with me for about five minutes) immediately diagnosed me bipolar and prescribed three separate medications. The meds make me incredibly unstable, and after discharge when seeing an outpatient provider I tried to explain that they were making me feel worse, manic and depressed and angry and anxious. Instead of taking me off them and actually discussing the root of the issue (the trauma) they upped my dosage and prescribed more. By 16 I was on 8 different psychiatric medications, and by 20 I had been hospitalized 16 times for 16 separate attempts.
I was 25 when I had a complete psychotic break, was committed involuntarily, and was taken off all medication. Amazingly, after a few weeks, I stabilized completely. Like honestly, I felt clear and able to regulate my emotions and mentally WELL for the first time in over a decade. When I was discharged I sought trauma based therapy, did 6 months of EMDR, and learned to cope with the trauma.
I am now 28 years old, have a stable full time job taking care of adults with IDD in a group home, am about to graduate with a BS in psychology and move directly into a masters program, live with my partner in a happy, healthy relationship, own a car, pay my bills, and have many stable, sustained friendships. I have not taken any medication (aside from an occasional asthma inhaler) in about 3 years and it has honestly been the best three years of my life. I am able to process negative situations in a clear and mature way, and I can handle conflict and regulate my emotions in a way I could while on the meds.
I fully believe that biochemically there are people with imbalances who require medication to level themselves, however I am not one of them. I experienced trauma, and that coupled with the general mode irregularities of puberty, caused me to act out.
I try not to hold resentment towards the doctors that refuse to listen to me for a decade, but it‚Äôs a challenge. I think about where I would be today if someone had just asked me WHY I was feeling like ending it all, rather than trying to solve the problem with medications that they wouldn‚Äôt allow me to get off of. It felt like a prison, and I‚Äôm grateful to be out of it, but I feel for all those like me who may still be stuck, desperately pleading with doctors to hear them out, to believe that the meds are making them feel worse, and being told in return that ‚Äúit‚Äôs just their disease talking and they need the medication to function‚Äù.
This is why I‚Äôm dedicating my life to helping adolescences in crisis, with an emphasis on behavioral and cognitive therapy PRIOR to medicating. I lost out on having a childhood, and I hope to prevent that from happening to as many others as I can."

Behavioral and cognitive therapy for childhood trauma are often also retraumatizing and invalidating. Trauma specialized therapy is what people who have experienced child abuse need, not behavioral or cognitive therapy.

"I am going fast down a dark tunnel, I have no way to afford therapy, am jobless, carless. I posted on Reddit a couple of times and both made me feel worse. My latest post was read 125 times and not one person commented. I desperately needed just.... a less bleak perspective, just ONE person, someone to give me a fresh take. I just deleted it because it affirmed that i am nothing. All those people read it and must have thought, ""yeah, she IS nothing, I have nothing to add"". this is a throwaway, but this is for all the traumatized people needing help here- or anywhere online- nobody cares man. It sucks, but its true. There isn't a light in the darkness. 

I remember in Toronto once i saw a young Asian girl sitting on the sidewalk holding a sign that only said, ""HELP"". It was winter, she had no shoes. NOT one person, in the minutes I saw her, stopped and offered her anything, or talked to her at all. I could only give her a dollar. And I too walked away. 

It doesn't get more bleak. This is the world. This is what happens to all us nothing people, the people on the street or who are headed that way for untreated mental illness.....its the truth and running from it won't change it. We got here from trauma, and the world will traumatize us further. So don't bother reaching out. It will only make you feel worse.

"You're important and you matter. Right now it sounds like you need a lot of support that you're lacking. Sadly, while free, Reddit is not the safe place you wish it were. You're relying on complete strangers to be exactly what you need when you need it. Sometimes, that happens. Sometimes it doesn't, because feeds are sort of unreliable, or people accidentally scroll past, or it doesn't get seen before other stuff takes its place. And you're just as likely to meet someone harmful as helpful. 

You need a support network. Something in real life. It's so hard to establish that and takes a lot of energy, but it's so worth it. Having a trusted friend there to physically hold you when you cry will always be better for you than written word or even voice and video ever could be. That's basic human psychology. 

You also need professionals. I know it seems like everyone says that and it's expensive. Believe me, I'm paying out of pocket for my twice weekly therapy for three more weeks. It sucks.

Here is where you apply for OHP: [https://www.oregon.gov/oha/hsd/ohp/pages/apply.aspx](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/hsd/ohp/pages/apply.aspx)

You sound seriously suicidal. Of course people care, you're just not able to see it right now due to your illness. I suggest you go to your local emergency department and get help or better yet, get an evaluation at an inpatient psychiatric hospital. 

The problem with mental health is, you will not get better until you put the work in. Medications don't fix mental health problems, they just temporarily patch the issue, but the issue is still there, underneath the patch.

I'm sorry you feel this way. It's hard to live like this. You are not alone, even though it feels that way.

"It's a harsh thing to realize that people can turn a blind eye to anothers suffering. I have done it. The homeless are prevalent on the street where I live, and I don't help each one that I see. It is a hard thing to grapple with, of how do I help every one of them? It's impossible, without sacrificing so much of yourself. It takes all of us giving what we can, when we can, to make the world a better place. There will always be suffering in the world, it is an imperfect place. There are people out there that don't care to take the time or give when they have such excess. But like the yin yang, there are also many compassionate people out there that care about the suffering of complete strangers. I'm sorry you were left without a response on your last post, and hope you can find a true resource for therapy. I speak from experience, having an empathetic and present ear to talk to in dark times can do wonders for your mind and heart. Just takes finding a therapist (or friend) that you can connect to and feels like the right match. If you can't afford it, post a venmo or cashapp, and I would gladly donate to help pay for your first session.

"I have felt exactly this. Those people didn‚Äôt look at you and say ‚Äúshe is nothing‚Äù, they said nothing at all, they didn‚Äôt pay attention to you, or anyone. They are in their own mind, trying to find posts the resonate with THEM, humans are egotistical in that way. But that ego is also what saves us. You are the only person in your life that will consistently be there for you. No one else will dedicate their whole life for you to feel good, you need to do that yourself. It will make you feel wonderful to love YOU in that way, to know that, I love myself and I have that support, always- no matter what happens. 

Every time I have tried to find support online I have always been disappointed because approval from others can never fill the hole of self hate inside, you need to be the change in your life. You need to care and love yourself you care and love for others. Put that energy into your own life, you deserve that attention. If you‚Äôre not getting it from others, why should you not give it yourself? Because you are worthy. Even from this short post I can see that you give to others and expect the same in return.

That's the messed up truth of society; just because you need help, ask for help, put yourself out into the void, doesn't guarantee a response or your needs getting met.

i dont know if this is a completely universal thing but i unfortunately get incredibly aroused when im being forced or spoken to as though im beinng forced. the question i have today is: 

How do i stop it? can i somehow make my body stop reacting to it? is it possible or do i have to somehow deal with it?

"I'm 19, NB. Lately I've been trying to work through some childhood trauma by myself (can't afford therapy atm, but trying to use tools I've found online and through the free therapy I used to get before I turned 18). In essence, I was consistently bullied and isolated throughout the entirety of primary school (from age 4-11), and there's much more apart from that but this is what I'm mainly focusing on right now.

I can't help feeling that if any of the adults in my life had looked closely enough, they would've been able to see it and stop it from happening, but nobody did. My memory might be skewed but I don't remember ever having any support from my parents or teachers, not even the assistant teacher who stayed with my class for 7 years who I grew rather attached to. The only thing I have to go off of is one story my dad told me (I personally have no recollection of this) about how he attended a school event and watched one of my bullies continuously attacking me until I cried, and he had a real severe word with one of the teachers when he watched as no one did anything to stop it. Apart from that, I don't know if my parents truly knew about the torment I was going through every day. Among other examples, in the early years of school I was in the nurse's office pretty much all the time, for various grazes and bruises that I think everyone chalked up to me running around and falling over when in fact, I was being tripped and shoved by other kids.

I want to ask my parents about it, because I think my memory of that time is majorly affected by the trauma I went through, so I may not be seeing it from all sides. In the version of events that I have in my traumatised brain, I don't think I had any adults who were trying their best to protect me, and I felt completely alone, and to this day that's affecting how I connect with others and go about my daily life. So I want to ask my parents if they knew everything about what was going on and if they were ever doing anything to stop it, but I don't want them to think I'm blaming them, because honestly I think that even as a child I was rather good at hiding things. I don't want to place blame; my main focus is just figuring out how to process this trauma and minimise any affect that it's having on me as an adult. I also don't know what emotions it could bring up for them if I were to talk about it, because my family doesn't seem to like talking about this kind of thing. In the past my parents have occasionally said some things about bullying that sounded like dismissing the situation, like ""if you ignore the bullies they'll go away"", and stuff like that, and so I'm also a little worried that they'll say something dismissing and if that happens I'm afraid I'll come out of it feeling worse about the situation than I am now.

What is the best way I could go about setting up this conversation to avoid things like blame and dismissal? I really don't know what my parents even think my perception of the bullying is, because we're not the best at communicating (if you couldn't tell), so I don't even know if they're aware that I have Childhood Trauma, if that makes sense, but in terms of the adults around me during my childhood, their perspective on it would be really valuable. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and I'm hoping that all the rambling I've done here makes sense."	waterwillowxavv	post	15.155550029667381	female	White	0.005872087087482214	na	na	na	2	traumatoolbox	age: 19, gender: non-binary, explanation: the author self-identifies as 19 and non-binary (expressed as 'nb'). there is no clear information available to predict the author's ethnicity.

"Is this my Fault??? Be honest!!ü§îü§îü§î


So wait a minute!!!


My ex-bf brother did this shit again!!!


Same Scenario!!!


Me watching¬† a movie, he talks /ask me about the movie, Then He shows himself off to me !!!


I told my Ex-bf about the First incident and Today I also told him about This incident that had happened last Night!!!


My ex-bf call his other Brother Camion (not his real Name!---( and My Ex-bf then tells Camion about what I had told him!!


Camion thinks I had something to do with it‚Äîand basically told my Ex-bf not to Believe me!!!


And my ex-bf,(Does exactly that!!)


Camion told my ex-bf that if the same Scenario went down then it's Now my fault basically!!!


And Everyone believe that!!


My ex-bf and his other brother Camion!!!


Short version: This is what Mario did to me:üëáüëáüëá

Note: Mario is the brother that's being creepy to me!!)


Here what happened:üëáüëáüëá


Basically last night I am Extreme Anxiety!!


And my Anxiety made me scared!!


My Ex-bf was sleeping, So I ( just Wanted to be around people that Awake instead of sleep!)

Because I just wanted to feel safe/ because I was really Scared!!!


So basically ( I'm already know what Mario did to me in the past!!!)---But He told me that he was Sorry about it!!--(So I thought it would be ‚ÄîSomewhat ok to go watch the movies with B and Mario again!!--(I basically try giving Mario a pass, basically turning a blind eye to what he did to me in the past!!)


So I went in and watched the Movie ‚Äî(B)--Mario's girl


B feel asleep (just like last time!!)


And I'm still up watching the Movie ‚Äî(just Luke last time!!)


But I was hoping that Mario would not do the same thing like he did last time!!!


( So I just continued to watch the movie)


FAST-FORWARD


1:Mario started asking me about the movie and I responded!!!¬† (Just like last time!!)


2: Mario then showed Him D part and asked me to look at it ( he took his D part out just like last time)--except he didn't ask me to look at it like last time!!)


3: I got very Nervous/Scared ‚Äî(I basically was so scared/Nervous ‚Äî(it was really hard to talk or think straight!!--(just like last time!!)


4: I asked him ‚Äì Do he want me to leave!!--(Not like last time!!---Not like last time!!)----Not!!


5:He asked me to touch his D part ‚Äî(Just like last time!!----And I said No!!!--(just like last time!!!


6: Mario also was Saying things to me like: ""your Sexy"", like really you are!!, Or say things like: --- Asked if Me and (my ex-bf is still together!!!""--(Which is Mario's Brother!!)

¬†Or say things like: ""You Like D word!""


Or say: That he couldn't Resist, because I'm Sexy""---



7: After everything I then told my Ex-Bf about it (just like last time)



My Ex-Bf tells me that it's basically my fault ‚ÄîBecause he tells me that any Other female would have left the room or something!!!


( I tried to explain to my ex-bf that I was really scared/Nervous ‚Äî(That it was really Hard to think!!----HE basically Not caring about this anymore!!!


Now I Feel like it was completely my fault because I didn't leave the room or something!!!


But I was just really scared and uncomfortable/Nervous to Even think Straight!!!


FAST-FORWARD Camion and my Ex-Bf believe that I must have wanted to do that with Mario, Because the incident happened Twice!!!--(Once at B's house and One at My Ex-bf house!!)


My question is!!!


1:Did I do something wrong???


2:If I watched a movie with B and Mario again Even after Mario had did this to me in the past‚ÄîBut Yet I forgave him because he said he was Sorry!!---(is this my fault for watching the Movie with Mario again???


3: Am I the victim in this situation or am I the person that Start this???


Because my Ex-Bf tells me that I basically Allowed this to happen to me ‚ÄîSince it had happened already and yet I still chose to watch the Movie with Mario again after that !!!"	FunAd7699	post	14.785812603022888	male	White	0.9989111423492432	na	na	na	5	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"This is a real big question and the answer is just as big, so there will be more to this, but I'll try to simplify the answer as much as I can for the sake of brevity. 

Essentially the brain detects a threat in your environment via the sound of someone shouting, pain to the body, tonal indicators that conflict is coming, etc and the response every time is for the amygdala to ""sound the alarms"" and flood the body with stress hormones. These can make the senses more sensitive to intake more information and make more informed decisions about your safety, pull the blood back from the extremities to keep superficial injuries that you might get from defending yourself from causing major issues, constrict the muscles to brace for impacts and get ready to run or fight, or physically cause the body to just drop to conserve energy waiting for a good moment to get away from the threat and to keep from offending an attacker, etc. The problem is, trauma confuses the brain. In many instances the attack doesn't make sense and therefore the brain can't tell for sure whether the threat is over or not and it just keeps sounding the alarm like the button is stuck. Sending signals all through the sympathetic nervous system. But, the body isn't meant to stay in this survival mode. It's supposed to be used for a quick escape to safety or a last ditch effort at surviving an attack. 15 minutes or less. Running these signals constantly causes stress to build in the mind and store in the muscles. The muscles forget how to naturally relax. The nerves begin to feel like they could catch fire at any moment, like you've got to keep moving or like there's a subtle itch deep within your bones. You can't get comfortable. Thoughts continue racing trying to figure out what went wrong, why you weren't safe, and how to get to safety long after you're already out of the dangerous situation. This pulls energy usage away from other areas of the brain and body and much like running a computer constantly it starts to overwork and overheat just about everything until parts start to burn out or shut down throwing themselves into low power mode. Meanwhile the muscles are still so used to being tense that when they're forced to relax it can be painful and it starts the whole process over again.

"I have been trying to mentally prepared myself to read my old messages with my rapist.  I‚Äôm trying to decide whether or not to report my rape from years ago and I want to see if there‚Äôs any evidence in the messages that could help with my case, which is why I‚Äôll be reading them in the first place. 

I‚Äôve been having panic attacks along with a tight chest, nightmares and dreams, flashbacks constantly (including during sex which has been awful), etc.  Please share some tools I can use to cope with PTSD and the things I described in general, and some ways to cope while reading the messages and then after.

Is there anyone you trust that you could have read the messages and screen for evidence? I'm sorry you have experienced this, and are reliving it now.. I know that therapy is often recommended on this sub, but it could help you find the tools you're looking for to process this and move forward if you decide to. This is a very difficult thing to go through alone, and a professional could help you unpack some of these feelings in a safe environment.

Thank you for your response. ‚ù§Ô∏è I have only a couple of people I would trust with that, but 2 would be triggered by it, and my boyfriend would not do well with reading all of the messages between my ex and I. I am in therapy but I don‚Äôt get to see her very often because of her schedule and my availability. I‚Äôve talked with her about the possibility of reporting, but we didn‚Äôt go through any skills that I could use to get through the panic attacks. The panic attacks started again after I saw her last, so I haven‚Äôt seen her since it‚Äôs gotten worse.

"so i was thinking about this one person and finally decided to forget about them, i cried earlier yesterday but not related to this person. i don‚Äôt cry over ppl that aren‚Äôt my family btw. but yeah i was already emotional then i was like forget this kid.

but yeah i was like forget em, then i was like i need to take my mind off things so i was like lemme go to the movies high, that‚Äôs always fun. So i went late around 9:50 and to see spider-man. it had already been running so i didn‚Äôt think it would be packed.

Tell me why as soon as i get there i think i see this kid. but i was high so i just told myself i‚Äôm literally obsessed and crazy. so i‚Äôm like lemme enjoy this movie. and i see someone that looked like him for behind but i legit thought i was reaching. BOOM it‚Äôs him he turns around.

Its him What are the fucking odds, he didn‚Äôt see me. my mind is racing my heart is pumping. i was like wtf. Just so you know, i live in one of the most populated cities in AMERICA. one the biggest cities. same movie, same time, same place, HE SAT RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

i was just like no way this is the worst coincidence EVER. so basically i met him and some girl at a party i made out with both of them. (i had a gf at the time‚Ä¶ ik im a shitty person, i was drunk but stil no excuse) but yeah so the next day i was like my gf doesn‚Äôt deserve

 doesn‚Äôt deserve this and i don‚Äôt deserve her, so i decide we have to end it. okay going back to the present i seen him at the movies the day we broke up. i was dealing with shit all day, i got my bill for school. i was in a frenzy

, but yeah i felt like the universe was punishing me like throwing in my face what i had did. i just wanted to be alone for one night no one i knew jsur me and my high lol. but no the universe didn‚Äôt want that for me. i sat there fighting to text him that i‚Äôm right behind him

 i did end up telling him. i played around first like, ‚Äúturn ur phone off‚Äù 
‚Äúhot date ‚Äú. ‚Äúgreen really not ur color‚Äù. then he was looking around then seen me. we exchanged a laugh and a awkward smile then went about our night. but yeah i no longer believe im 100% straight

maybes it‚Äôs just a man crush or something like that but yeah. idk that just messed with my mental all night. LIKE WHAT ARE THE ODDS. and he lives 25 mins away from me. so why are we at the same movie theater. ughhhh

yeah idk what‚Äôs should i do, tell him how i feel and hopefully he secretly feels the same way or what. he said he‚Äôs not gay or bi or wtvr. but at the same time. nvm another story for another day, i know i‚Äôm still into girls bc of this one girl i can‚Äôt forget.

yeah i‚Äôm just so confused cuz this one girl is on my mind 24/7 and when she‚Äôs not on my mind i think of him. ugh it‚Äôs all shut so UGHH like fuck can i just live and life be easier. we could only dream lol. i love the idea of him, but i think i love her.IDK k bye"	SpiritualRaccoon902	post	13.244479473601283	male	White	0.9946839213371277	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

Recently I had a very bad experience which left me feeling a little traumatized. At this particular time, there was a person which consoled me and whom I sort of felt safer when close to. Now when I feel of this moment on the one hand I feel like they remind me of it, but on the other I think an emotional pull to them because they are linked to this experience. What is this I am experiencing, is it wrong (I am assuming it is) and how can I fix it or stop it from happening?	ninabrave	post	19.692485419700567	female	White	0.010686470195651054	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

i made a throwaway account for this and dont know exactly where to post so remove if its not ok!

i dont know what to really say like is sorta describing it considered inappropriate or something? idk how else to word it‚Ä¶ so if this is not okay feel free to let me know or remove it! sorry in advance?

okay so basically, me and this guy, (we‚Äôll call him H) me (22f)  and H (25m) had just began talking the same day on tinder and our conversation was so so good and the vibe was immaculate and he wanted to hangout that night (he said in our texts that we would drive around listen to music and eat while we hung out), i had already told him that im very awkward and anxious when meeting new people so i didnt know about meeting up with him, but he had assured me that he would make sure i was okay and that i wouldn‚Äôt regret it. honestly, i never meet people i havent spoke to for a while but that changed that night.

that night H picked me up from my house, he had opened the door for me (from the inside like reachingn over) and we shook hands. We began driving away from my house and he asked me, ‚Äúdid you want to go eat at a restaurant or did you just want to come to my hotel room and order in?‚Äù and i gave a tight smile, looking out the window to my right kind of shrugging, ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter to me..‚Äù i said but honestly i was hoping for the dining out, but i am a timid person like extremely bad at saying no and some other stuff. so he chose his hotel room and i just let it happen because i couldn‚Äôt really say anything right then.

We made it to his hotel, he walked inside with me and we walked the hallway to his room. it wasn‚Äôt super tidy but it wasnt messy, it just looked like he was doing work stuff previously. i had sat on the edge of the bed, and just was quiet, he joined me shortly after, scooting closer and leaning close i met his eyes briefly, he definitely wanted to kiss me, but eventually we just chose what to eat, and ordered pizza on uber eats or skip or something. he had chosen to watch something and we took our shoes off and sat on the bed more.

after we chose what to watch, he put it on the laptop and we just watched it fir a while but he held my hand and i let him, but as the show continued on his other hand started rubbing up and down on my arm, and i could literally feel his gaze upon me, it was so very clear he wanted to kiss, but i literally couldnt keep eye contact, and wasn‚Äôt really ready to kiss him, i remember my heart racing. i don‚Äôt remember how long after but he stopped holding my hand and brought his hand(s) to my face and turned my head to face him, he leaned forward and out foreheads touched for a few seconds before he kissed me. i was a bit shocked and unsure but i kissed him back, and he just kept doing it, not leaving my lips. he moved the computer off his lap as he continued kissing me, he grabbed my wrists and pinned them beside my head against the headboard and kissed me almost harder? it was different. my eyes were open and i pushed against his hold a bit like enough where if he wasnt holding with much effort i wouldve broke free, but i was stuck, i felt so restrained, my heart was racing. in that moment i knew he was much stronger than me.

i don‚Äôt remember how long the kiss lasted but he eventually pulled away, and i risked a look at him as he backed off of me, his eyes stared into mine almost with an indescribable look. i looked away almost immediately but he continued and he began undressing me and kissing me again. i wish i could‚Äôve said no, but i just couldnt.

moving past some stuff, he groped me, went down on me, and fingered me‚Ä¶ i stayed quiet for the most part, just staring at the ceiling mostly, and when i looked at him, he was always staring at me, it was unnerving. we both had not said anything as he did it, it was just my‚Ä¶ whimpers? moans? idk im very quiet so it wasn‚Äôt really loud‚Ä¶ but he added a third finger and i physically and louder than i was winced and said(?) ‚Äúow.‚Äù and he took it out, two fingers honestly was pushing it to be honest‚Ä¶

not too long later he had his pants down and his shirt off, he had lined himself up with my entrance‚Ä¶. and pushed but i again let out a whimper or something? i know i said ‚Äúow‚Äù or ‚Äúah‚Äù i dont recall. he stopped and crawled up to get me to give him oral, and i did..

i don‚Äôt remember how long but he eventually went back down and pushed himself in despite it hurting me, but honestly i dont think he knew or noticed though.

he was having sex with me, and pullingn out and telling me how to lay, or moving me himself, into certain positions and then entering me again. it hurt most of the time, the only time it didn‚Äôt really hurt was when i had to give him oral, i hated it but i continued. i literally dont know why i did‚Ä¶

i dont even remember much more besides him cumming on my chest‚Ä¶ and him grabbing tissues and the pizza from outside. and i was just naked and cover with‚Ä¶ him.

i excused myself to the bathroom with most of my clothes, and i peed, and then stood in front of the mirror, and i remember holding back my tears and looking at my reflection with such disgust, i honestly hated it, my reflection‚Ä¶ me.

when i got out and came back, there was pizza on the bed and he placed a cup of ginger ale in my hand and a piece of pizza. i was extra paranoid so i didnt drink it.

the rest of the night only lasted like 30 minutes since i wanted to go home, and he ordered an uber, and i took off and had small talk with the driver.

i honestly do blame myself, and don‚Äôt really think it was rape because i didnt say no and its not like i pushed him away or anything to let him know i didnt want to‚Ä¶ i literally gave him oral multiple times that night. but i opened up with a friend and he says it was rape‚Ä¶ i didnt know what to believe so im just asking you‚Ä¶ anyone.

i know it was stupid to meet someone off tinder and meet someone the same day, im well aware how stupid i was. this happened almost two months ago and im getting a bit less emotional about it well not really but im trying my best.

just as more info that im not even sure is relative but i have a sorta long history of sexual abuse. so i dont know if im being dramatic and making a big deal out of nothing.. but any input will be much appreciated. thank you"	Pristine_Heart_6402	post	19.12881217530599	male	White	0.009484316222369671	na	na	na	6	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"Yes. I‚Äôm sorry. It is quite common to freeze, especially when you have a history of abuse that teaches you to be demure/fawn to stay safe. While you didn‚Äôt verbally say no, a lot of cues we give to people are through body language- you did physically push against him in the beginning, you did not take an active role in it. Just reading this made me feel sick because it‚Äôs so clear to me that it was not sex, it was him forcing sex onto you. 

And for wondering why you ‚Äúdid‚Äù oral- again, given a history of abuse that you‚Äôve been through, it makes sense that you just did what he wanted. Even people that haven‚Äôt been through abuse may freeze and/or fawn for various reasons: out of instinct to hope that once it‚Äôs over you can get away, in hopes that they‚Äôll be bored. If you said no, then what? He may have become violent. I think You were doing what you did, even on a base level if you weren‚Äôt necessarily thinking it at the time, to stay safe. And you shouldn‚Äôt blame yourself. The only person responsible is him. I‚Äôm sending so much love. Please take care of yourself.

Also, I recommend the sub r/adultsurvivors . I‚Äôve used it and people are for the most part very kind there. (Close your dms first.)"	Pristine_Heart_6402	reply	na	na	na	0.009484316222369671	strong	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"Unfortunately I agree with your friend, this was rape. It seems that there were some obvious non-verbal and body language cues here that he blatantly ignored. The reason you didn‚Äôt fight back or say ‚Äúno‚Äù was likely because you were scared of his reaction and/or you went into freeze mode as the above commenter described. 

I have been in situations like this with guys from Tinder and it‚Äôs awful. It‚Äôs clear that we‚Äôre uncomfortable but they don‚Äôt care, and it feels like too risky of a situation to fight back."	Pristine_Heart_6402	reply	na	na	na	0.009484316222369671	weak	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"While this situation may not meet the legal definition of the crime of rape, in my opinion it doesn‚Äôt matter that you didn‚Äôt tell him no. You are not to blame. The guy should have read your discomfort and asked if you were okay with proceeding. Many women freeze and fear that saying no will make a bad situation worse, because if the guy gets angry, you‚Äôre alone in a hotel room with a stranger. So we as women do what they want because we are hoping it will be less terrible if we just do what they want. Shutting down like you did is often a trauma response and/or coping mechanism. 

You did nothing wrong.
Please don‚Äôt blame yourself.  Just because you meet someone on Tinder and talk to them doesn‚Äôt mean they are entitled to have sex with you. You can change your mind. That is okay. 
Please get checked for STDs/STIs right away, and again 6 months from now.
You deserve to be safe, comfortable, and consenting. I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you."	Pristine_Heart_6402	reply	na	na	na	0.009484316222369671	weak	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
Yes it was. I know it‚Äôs not always easy to say no and when you‚Äôre shy it makes it that much harder. As soon as I read that you said you wanted to say no but felt like you couldn‚Äôt my mind was made up. But also the fact that nobody ever got consent and you were uncomfortable the whole time proves that he definitely raped you. He just kept doing things and you kept going with it because you froze up DONT BLAME YOURSELF‚Ä¶ if he was actually any type of interested in you he wouldn‚Äôt have hurt you and would‚Äôve initially asked for permission.

I actually have been choked by my father a few times.... Like really choked.... But of course each time he eventually let go‚Ä¶

It was one time when he choked me‚Ä¶My father said to me while he was choking me‚Ä¶. (And I qoute: "" Now imma kill you!!)

I really thought I was gonna die‚Ä¶..

Fast-forward‚Ä¶Since my dad choked me and my sister and we called the police so many time about our dad choking up‚Ä¶.( I guess the state made me and my dad go to court‚Ä¶.(one of my other sister was supposed to go‚Ä¶. But she never came‚Ä¶ fast forward ‚Äî I had an option to tell the people that helping me with this case‚Ä¶( To either let them send my dad to jail for choking me or either let him come back home‚Ä¶. But he's not allowed to choked me or etc‚Ä¶( hit me any way‚Ä¶) ‚Äî For a whole year‚Ä¶.
I chose to let my dad get one more chance‚Ä¶ and come back home and not hit me/touch me for a whole year‚Ä¶.

(And if he did hit me‚Ä¶. He going to jail‚Ä¶For Sure!!!


But far as me being traumatized by what my father did‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.(My dad choking me part‚Ä¶..) doesn't really bothers me at all‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

(donest bother far as trauma or anything like that‚Ä¶..But his actions when he did choke me was definitely‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

dont want to get into it much but I'm only recently really nervous and scared about driving in cars even if im not the one driving. my mom is somewhat of a road rager and im so scared something bad is going to happen because of it. my older sister drives kinda crazy for my taste (very fast) and im worried we'll get into a crash. im at the age where you begin to learn to drive and maybe even go to driving dchool, how do I kick my fear of the road and vehicles before then? should I try exposure therapy and just tuff it out? anyone else relate and know what to do?

"I have a tendency to overthink or just deny parts of me, so I guess this isn't a new feeling. Sorry if this is convoluted, but I feel like background is needed.

I've never liked or felt entirely safe around my stepfather. He is the complete opposite of my biological father; he's from the deep south (US), comes from a military background, and is kind of the spitting image of southern hypermasculinity. That's not to say he doesn't have some redeeming traits, it's just not a lot. My mom has become much of a traditional housewife to him and although she tells me she's fine with it, it frustrates me the way he expects her to do every chore for him without question. All he does when he gets home from work is watch TV for a bit and fall asleep, all while smoking inside like a chimney. He's burned holes in my mom's couch, her old bedspreads, everything. All of this and more makes me very uncomfortable around him.

He's very quick to anger, though. I jokingly told him to stop messing with our dog, a puppy at the time, who was napping. He told me that I was ""a fucking teenager and should learn some fucking respect"" because it's ""his house."" He threw a shoe at me one time. A couple incidents like that happened over the years, but as of this past year, he got set off and I had a full blown panic attack. He and his adult son who was visiting had a quiet, mild falling out, and his son left early. So he began to cry downstairs while I hid in the attic (I just felt something was off). A few minutes later, the crying escalated to insane, off the walls screaming. He broke things and threw things at the wall, broke the Christmas tree, shattered glass, etc. He has guns in the house so I was really fearing for my life. I had a panic attack. I was screaming probably louder than he was, trying to beg my mom to take me back to my biological dad's. She did. My stepdad never came upstairs.

Where I start to question if this is trauma is the fact that he never did anything to me. When I was panicking my mom just sat there and stared at me as if she was used to his behavior and treated me as if I was overreacting. But every time I'm reminded of the memory or if my stepdad gives me even the slightest hint that he's angry, I shut down. I just go in my room and sit there and listen. I fully expect something horrible to happen every day I'm here. My biological dad is also an alcoholic, but he's been sober for years and we get along great now. I do have some fear and bad memories around him yelling when I was very little, though, and I wonder if that affected my reaction.

Sorry about the length of this. I couldn't find a shorter way to put it."	Quarantine_Rat	post	27.38222850479434	female	White	0.9977140426635742	na	na	na	3	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

Idk if this is the sub to put this in but I‚Äôm keeping it short. I loved baking, I‚Äôve done it ever since I was a kid. The event I have in mind involved baking to a degree and now I cannot bake. I‚Äôve gotten into cooking a bit here and there but I want to buy a fancy mixer with all these attachments to start baking again but the thought of doing it makes me feel sick.

"Is this something that have traumatized me? I lack emotions and can‚Äôt really tell‚Ä¶

(Long story, i hope someone wants to talk about this with me in DM)

!All of this happened over a chat, so there wasn‚Äôt anything physical!

I was 14yo old boy, i was just reading a site where people used to hook up, i wasn‚Äôt trying to find company i was just curious. There was this one post where a man wanted to find ‚Äùdomestic slave‚Äù (i am not sure is that the right term, but basically he wanted to find a maid who cooks, cleans the house, and he wanted to train a ‚Äùslave‚Äù). I was shoked when i read that and thought that it was gross. I was still interested to know who might want to be someone like that and opened the comments of the post (i was 14 and never even heard of kinks and all those things, i am not shaming anyone but i was so young i didn‚Äôt even understand). Someone had commented that they would be interested but only problem was that he was a ‚Äùsissy‚Äù, (male who is sexully female and dresses up as a woman, often submissive). I had no idea what sissy was and thought it was just some kink. As a joke, i commented that i would be perfect but i am a man, and ‚Äùhairy 50yo with a beer belly‚Äù. Then we talked for a while and i was just trolling him. I told him that i was really a ‚Äù16yo boy‚Äù (legal age in my country). I can‚Äôt remember how, but i got intrrested about that idea of being  maid. He told that he would train me and pay me all kinds of things.

And what did i do‚Ä¶ I SAID YES‚Ä¶ (i am pretty sure the guy manipulated me somehow).  I sent him some photos and he complimented me. There was some rules that i had to agree, 1. Watch 30mins of sissy porn 2. Wear girly underwear 3. Train myself.

For couple days, i made up excuses to avoid the tasks, but he got angry. 

(Now comes the part i have to warn people with similar experiences)

He sent me a schedule for the sexual tasks, and told me to dress up like ‚Äùwhore‚Äù and do my makeup. 

I started doing the sexual tasks as he wanted. I did them and felt humiliated and shameful but still continued. After a while, even though he said that i should never ejaculate, i did so anyways‚Ä¶

It was horrible, i was SO ashamed and embarrased of myself, i felt that there is no way i could recover over this humiliating experience. It really destroyed my self worth. I immidately blocked him, went to shower and destroyed anything that reminded me  of that incident. 

I was quite and shamed for a long time but never show it to anyone. I wanted to forget the whole thing and just made myself busy with other things.

For this day on no one else knows this. Recovering from that changed my personality, i have need for dominance and i lack emotions. I can‚Äôt feel anything over that event anymore, no sadness, shame, nothing‚Ä¶. I only remeber what i felt then.


I am not sure was that traumatizing or not, was that ‚Äùenough‚Äù to cause a trauma‚Ä¶"	spacedoutamyhead	post	26.28396760286701	female	White	0.9977052807807922	na	na	na	5	traumatoolbox	ethnicity: unknown, age: 16-18, gender: male, explanation: the author shares a past traumatic event that occurred when he was 14 and refers to himself as a boy/man, thereby identifying his gender as male. the time elapsed from the event isn't specifically identified but seems to be a few years, placing him in the age range of 16 to 18 years old. the author does not provide sufficient information to identify his ethnicity.

Thank you so much! I really appreciate your comment!

"What you experienced was absolutely traumatic. When it comes to traumatic events, it's not really about *what* happened, but *how* it affected you. And it's clear from your description that it affected you a lot. 

It's great that you're in therapy, but try not to focus too much on those labels. Trauma can change you in so many ways, and often things that you think are ""you"" are in fact the trauma still affecting you. So while you might show signs of the things you listed, it doesn't necessarily mean that's who you are. It might be the unresolved trauma, and it might change when you go through recovery. 

I understand the shame, many people feel it from their trauma. But I can assure you that none of that was your fault. The blame isn't on you, it's on that man who manipulated and hurt you. I know it's easy to say, but whatever you did is nothing to be ashamed of. Even if you did that on your own will, which you didn't (you were manipulated), it still wouldn't be shameful. 

There's a podcast that I love, it's called the Trauma Tapes. The whole second season is about shame. It's a great source and I highly recommend it!"	spacedoutamyhead	reply	na	na	na	0.9977052807807922	weak	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
Thanks! Actually i don‚Äôt go to therapy on regular, i have gone there actully from another reason (which of course was a cause of these traumas), i find ot hard to talk about it to anyone since i can‚Äôt feel shame or sadness about it anymore, but more because i don‚Äôt want others to see my weaknesses or anything ‚Äùhumiliting‚Äù, because i hate when people on real life start to feel pity for me :(	spacedoutamyhead	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9977052807807922	no	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"Hey, so for context I grew up in an incredibly abusive, controlling and restrictive household where my mother, would fight with everyone in the house. When I say restricting I mean RESTRICTING. I got my first phone when I was 12 or so and from that age up until I was 17, I was not allowed to have safari, download apps, all my social media accounts were on my moms phone, and she also had an iPad connected to my phone to read all my texts. She did the same for my sister. I wasn‚Äôt even allowed to go outside without being harassed. As a result, I have CPTSD, OCD, anxiety, depression, etc. I think I may have experienced some covert sexual abuse by my sister, who is four years older than me. Maybe not, but definitely something. Some of the memories are hazy but some are very clear. 

So now that I‚Äôve given a small bit of context, now to the part that tears me apart to this day. From ages 11-13 or so I had some very shameful sexual fantasies, mostly about friends I had in my class, but the worst being when I‚Äôd masturbate to fantasies about my sister and what she‚Äôd do to me and use whatever photos I had in my camera roll as an aid for that. Keep in mind my photos were the only thing I had to use as my outlet. At this time, I didn‚Äôt even know what sex was, I would just fantasize about getting lap dances, and twerked on LOL I would NEVER actually be interested in having sexual relations with my family, to me it was just a nice body that I forgot about as soon as I was done. Part of me feels like I kinda had no other outlet I guess? I also had ZERO sexual education, as well as a slew of undiagnosed mental illnesses. I have this internal conflict of thinking ‚Äúwell of course you did this, bodies respond to stimulation no matter who it‚Äôs from‚Äù but then I have the OCD part telling me I‚Äôm worthless, and a disgusting freak. I know my family dynamic was absolutely not normal, but the shame over this nearly brought me to suicide earlier this year. I am in desperate need of advice.

It's normal to start developing your sexuality at that age. And sexual experimentation among siblings is actually quite common. I understand it can feel confusing and overwhelming, but you don't need to despise yourself or feel bad about it.

Thanks for sharing this. As I said in my post, my sister is about 4 years older than me which puts us in a pretty different developmental stage at nearly any age.

Shame around sexuality is common. I don't think this case counts as sexual abuse, because you did not actually take any actions that hurt anyone else.	OCDshameposting	reply	na	na	na	0.9899090528488159	no	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"It's true that she is older than you, but your fantasies were only in your own head right? I think it's fairly common to fantasize about girls / women of many different ages, regardless of your own age.

Males tend to be more visual in their sexuality, so given your lack of an outlet and education, it's not surprising that you would turn to fantasizing about people you knew around you. This is how many men approach porn as well - as purely visual imagery and not an emotional connection or something they would actually want to perform in real life.

You may want to check out a book called My Secret Garden. It's about women's sexual fantasies, but it can be helpful for men as well to normalize sexual fantasies."	OCDshameposting	reply	na	na	na	0.9899090528488159	no	no	strong	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

Fantasies were all private yup. I was far too scared to talk to my parents in general, much less about that! Fantasizing about my older sister is probably the most taboo one I‚Äôve had, and to me that fantasy was always a last resort if I had no other imagery.

Anyone who uses shame as a way to motivate someone (regardless of intention) is not someone to be friends with. And yet they always make excuses for him. ‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs just the way he is‚Äù ‚Äúhe meant well‚Äù ‚Äúhe‚Äôs coming from a place of caring and support‚Äù no no no no. If he actually cared he wouldn‚Äôt be shaming her. He‚Äôd be lending a hand. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know him like I do‚Äù ‚Äúhe has a sensitive side he just hides it really well‚Äù they always use classic victim language and classic abuse excuses when talking about him. How do I convince my wife that her best friend of 20 years isn‚Äôt this great guy she thinks he is?? He is the ring leader in the friend group. When there is conflict they all look to him. He usually dismisses it or pacifies the conflict temporarily. He could say stop and they‚Äôd stop. But he doesn‚Äôt. He waits for it to hit a head and then does something about. He waits until both parties have said something they can‚Äôt take back and then he doesn‚Äôt have to pick a side and can play hero. Things like that is why my wife thinks he is so supportive. He enable one of the friends alcoholism because he thinks it‚Äôs funny when he gets drunk and can barely talk. Alcoholism and depression run in that friend‚Äôs family. Knowing that, I‚Äôm not comfortable being around the enabling. But I don‚Äôt understand how they can all stick up for him when he‚Äôs doing shit like that! My wife told me that one ‚Äúfriend‚Äù keeps calling her the T slur. And she says that she doesn‚Äôt want to pull him into it because he‚Äôd take the transphobes side. And she still stands by him!! What do I do??? She‚Äôs talking about potentially leaving the group but she doesn‚Äôt want to. And she‚Äôs still using the victim talk and I hate seeing her hurt. But she gets so defensive when I talk about how I don‚Äôt like her friend. Uhg this is so complicated.	breezeboo	post	27.81467370671809	male	White	0.9991675615310669	na	na	na	2	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

I was browsing Stan (streaming service), and I started watching a few shows. 
I started watching Year Of, which I've heard good reviews about. It's an Australian coming of age type show, but I could only watch a few minutes as it was too triggering. 

Then I start watching a Stacey Dooley documentary about sex offenders. Which was interested, but again, only got so far in before I was flooded with memories of being abused.

Of course PTSD. stressors will trigger you and memories as you relate to them until those problems are resolved. A time where you went through tremendous stress is going to be followed by resistance because your body went through a lot :) our nervous system remembers every experience and prevent us from being hurt again, which would explain triggers. (So you see the trigger and get as far away from it as possible to protect yourself) But it‚Äôs okay, it just means you are learning and a mind that is learning is going to resist sometimes. But you will one day have to face your triggers because if you don‚Äôt you will continue to find them in your everyday life. A life where you‚Äôre triggered by everything is not a great life to experience.	donttouchmybreadgov	reply	na	na	na	0.998336911201477	no	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"A variety of therapy techniques, google or YouTube 'overcoming PTSD' or variations of that, do some research on it. Patrick teahhan has some good YouTube videos to start understanding the roots of trauma from childhood.

CBT techniques (cognitive brain therapy) are really one of the most effective treatments for PTSD.

I don‚Äôt have a good answer, but what you‚Äôre describing sounds almost like an OCD coping mechanism that I have. It‚Äôs like self induced desensitization so that we can feel ok with traumatic events, maybe as a way to heal from our own trauma? That‚Äôs just a theory though.

"TW: Abuse mentions, suicidal ideation

I‚Äôm not attractive. Those who say I am feel an inherent obligation to. I‚Äôll never be like either of my best friends, it‚Äôs just not going to happen. Ignoring that, I‚Äôm not smart either. I‚Äôve destroyed my brain through starvation and general trauma over the years, particularly in peak developmental years where my brain was at its most vulnerable. Verbal abuse from my mother, degrading me whenever I make the slightest mistake or she happens to be in a generally bad mood. Calling me stupid, lazy, telling me that I won‚Äôt go anywhere in life, and that she‚Äôd be embarrassed if she looked and carried herself how I did. My personality shifts so rapidly that I can‚Äôt even tell what‚Äôs me anymore. I‚Äôm not funny. I‚Äôm just too loud and too headstrong and easy to get carried away. 

My friends are too good for me. They‚Äôre sweet, caring individuals who don‚Äôt deserve to have someone like me dragging them down. Nothing about me is inherently negative in the way I behave. I do not abuse my friends. In fact, I‚Äôm at my happiest with them. However, they deserve far better than me and I‚Äôve been kept around solely for the fact that Ive been here the longest.

My ex is an interesting one. He found my past Reddit account, which had depression and eating disorder content. He didn‚Äôt tell me about this knowledge until 3 weeks later. That might, he revealed a secret to me that nobody else knows because of how shameful it is to him. We were not in a relationship until 2 months after that, but we were best friends quickly. In retrospect, I believe that he was only my friend because I was the first girl to ever give him attention in general. He is a redditor gamer band kid. Yeah. I told him about my fear of abandonment, and how I would stay up crying sometimes out of fear that those I love the most would lose interest in me and see myself the way that I see me. He assured me that this was not true, as I was ‚Äòbetter than obligation‚Äô and ‚Äònot a burden.‚Äô He later ghosted me. He did not intend to hurt me. On the 3rd time I confronted him about this, he finally admitted that he no longer wanted the burden of talking to me. 

I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve been his first choice had he had those. Either way, he never abused me, which I greatly appreciate.

I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be good enough for anyone. Parents, friends, myself. My suicidal thoughts are back once again. Just wanted to get this all out there."	PerfectBussy98	post	26.44129422705398	female	White	0.9932847023010254	na	na	na	4	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

due to trauma which started very early (2 months) and went on from there, I have many issues for example depression, anxiety, autoimmune disorder, frequent inflammatio, IBS, it goes on. One of my issues is with tachykardia which can be very annoying. The physical  structure of my heart is ok yet.

I constantly get told to ‚Äúget rid of stress‚Äù. But how can I get rid of the fact my body is seemingly in constant fight or flight? I even get tachycardia attacks at night, out of deep sleep.

Yes it is COCSA. I'm sorry your parents **should NEVER have left the boy alone with you** ( Unless they knew he wouldn't hurt you in any way) they were all negligent of your safety . ( & you have the right one day to tell them off for it ) if you ever wish to .

**He needed to be watched with another child to Make sure he wouldn't do such horrible things** to you bc of his intellectual disability  ( as no he prob wouldn't have been able to understand he was even hurting you & doing the wrong thing to you )  . ( as I'm sorry it would be very diff to press a case against him bc of it )  though ( bc of his disability ) they would just dismiss it ( saying he didn't understand  ( especially when he was 11) what he was doing ) NOT right at all ( you were deeply hurt & abused by this boy ) it should NOT have happened to you . YOur parents & his **are to blame for letting him be near you** without supervision .

>Yesterday I thought i got over it and I might finally be in peace until i remembered something, that guy continued to sexually abuse till I was like 13-14 yrs old.. (He was around 15-16) he was a teenage and I was a pre-teen at that moment.

His parents should have tried to teach him about appropriate touch & all . But it mighten have been possible also ( due to his mental  disability if severe ?)  ( & if they knew that they should of made damn sure he was NEVER allowed near children . As he was a danger to anyone ( including other children from SA or worse as well ) . **His parents are to blame for the s\*it he put you through . And YOUR own parents should of protect you better** ( by making sure he was being ok with you ) & not just leaving him alone with you . They should of checked up on you & made sure he wasn't hurting you  in any way physically or yes by doing what he did to you ( so YOU can be really mad at your parents for **neglecting YOUR safety with him** ( they should of checked up on you ) .

>but after some thinking I realized that it indeed happened and I can't help but feel concerned, upset and disgusted by it

I'm sorry yes it is very much still COCSA ( even though he didn't understand what he was doing was hurting you )  alot mentally ( from his sex attacks on you ) & physically how upsetting it was for you to have him doing such things to you . But yes he is to blame NOT  you . As He still did things he shouldn't have . **This is NOT your fault YOU were a child when this started .**  And YOU had NO way to stop it , nor knew how to . You wouldn't have been able to stop him in any way ( even if you had of tried ) . He would have been way bigger & stronger than you . Hense why his f\*cked up dumb parents **should NEVER of left you alone with him** ( without checking he wasn't hurting you ) on a reg basis . At 11 he would NOT have had the capacity to NO it was wrong sorry , but when he was older this is unknown . It depends if he could be trained at all in simple skills or not . Eg- could he understand NOT to do some things ( without being constantly reminded NOT to do it ) . Then yes he then could have been trained to some extent . If not then NO he would NOT have been mental competent at all to know it was even wrong to do to you .

Report this to his parents as well ( so they know ) **he is  a danger to any child near him still** .  **HE IS A SEX OFFENDER & NEEDS TO BE TREATED AS ONE** !   ( which means he needs supervision if ANY children are near him . He is a danger to them ( & will SA or r\*pe them now  he is older . And so yes He could easily do it again to a child .  If the pretend it wasn't a big deal . Report them to Child protection services . So they intervene in this  for other children's sake . To make sure he is nOT left alone with ANY kids now ever. As otherwise the  f\*ck would get away with it again . As he can claim he didn't know .

YOu have every right also to report it to the police ( making it known & official ) but they most likely will not go ahead with a case ( but it will make the parents take notice ) if they dismiss your efforts to stop him . The intrusion into their lives ( it still has to be investigated ) will be enough to make sure hopefully also that it doesn't occur again to others . YOu have EVERY right to be very p\*issed this occurred to you bc of him . It is ok to be mad , hurt & angry that NO one protected you from him & his actions against you . So don't let anyone tell YOU otherwise ( as YOU were wronged by him & his parents ) .

Seek out therapy to help you with this when you are ready . As NO **don't blame yourself** (put the blame on him & the parents ) .Tell yourself on repeat YOU didn't do anything wrong , you were a victim of him sex attacking you that was all . YOu wouldn't have been able to stop him ( as he was older & bigger than you ) & most also likely aggressive with you with it . YOu didn't have a choice but to do what he wanted back then , as they left yOU with him . A innocent child with a boy ( who back then didn't know any better ) . But they definitely should of checked up on him later on when he aged to make sure he wasn't hurting anyone near him .

* Also be aware **this boy will always remain a danger to you now** ok . He will just try ( especially if alone to SA ) you  again or r\*pe you  . Even when YOU are an adult he would try to sex attack you . As what occurred by him **will leave a trauma bond** in you both ( which draws him to you ) to want to have you .  So he **will always now be a sex threat to you** ok . So **don't be alone with him again EVER He will sex attack you easily**  . Avoid it at all costs ."

"I built a hate for my family: because of the rape stuff. when I was first assaulted I then told my sisters about it. and then my own twin sister made a joke about it.

she basically told me that: I took it like a pro and ever since then I hated her for it 

on top of that, just recently, my she just got assaulted in the store.---some guy that works there touched her butt.

and (since she didn't supported me about my rapes,and assaults.)

my first response was (in my mind thinking) I hope that she not looking for support about what happened to her in the store. I really hope that she would not be looking for support from me.---after all she did to me about minesüò†üò†üò†.

I was so angry in my mind, I told myself that she gonna deal with that herself and that I can careless about how she feels about the situation. since she wasn't/never there to support me about my rape... but instead decided to make a joke about it. Fuck her and her feelings üò†üò†üò†

Now:--(since she Doesn't Gives a Shit about mine Rapes)---

I Deep down just wish she could Feel how I feel ---if not worse!!!

---I completely know this is Fuck up to say but----(I just wish that She Got Raped----(in the WROSE way)---Of course her still alive and etc ----(Just so She can Feel My pain---(But In return I won't Support her,I won't care about her Truama, I won't Care how Depressed she Feels about it, I wanna Blame her for the Rape, or Make Jokes about it ....(I wanna At like it Not A Big Deal!!!)

I just need to let it all out. I let it all out on a group chat with some friends but I still feel like I didn‚Äôt heal from that moment, I still remember it happening. It was only a few months ago and I started doing better in school. I ended up getting an A-B honor roll which was the best thing that happened to me throughout the school year because I always had bad grades and I was glad I was improving my education. My parents were always mad at me for my grades so this was a first. The thing is that the school would let you choose a name you‚Äôd like to be called, like a nickname of some sort. I‚Äôm a trans masculine and I decided to have my new name be what the teachers wanted to call me. Now what happened is that my new name was on the honor roll and my mom ended up finding it in my folder. I was yelled at, insulted, got called the r slur multiple times by my mom, and hit. Writing this makes me wanna cry because this actually caused me trauma. In the moment I was pleading my mom to listen to me and told her I wanted my name changed but she kept hitting me and yelling at me. This made me have panic attacks and now I get uncomfortable and scared when people touch my legs/thighs because my mom hit me there.

Healthy and unhealthy are just ways for us to figure out what is a positive addition to your life and what is a negative addition to your life.

"Some background, I was in a very abusive relationship both physically and mentally from 2017-2020. I finally got out of it once he cheated on me and then broke up with me. I was devastated at that time but am doing so great mentally now and am thriving. 

However, after we broke up, he started somewhat stalking and harassing me and my friends. He would create multiple social media accounts to try to reach me. When he couldn‚Äôt, he would reach my friend. When he couldn‚Äôt reach my friends, he would have his friends reach me. When he couldn‚Äôt do that, he would have his friends reach my friends to have me unblock him. So overtime I‚Äôve accumulated multiple social media accounts I blocked of his and his friends. He even tried emailing me.

Anyway today when I was scrolling through Instagram, his page popped up on my suggested users list. I was pretty fucking sure i blocked that page but maybe I missed it. I even checked my blocked list and his main account was not there anymore. However he did make multiple accounts over time. I did still have 1 account blocked of his though. Instagram has the option where you can block and account and any other profiles they may have created but of course it failed. I also had to block a 2nd account of his today that I only found because he linked it in his account bio. 

I know he‚Äôs not making new accounts to reach me anymore, but having his page pop up, even though I‚Äôve done everything I could to prevent it was so triggering. 

I‚Äôve done my fair share of therapy and healing from the relationship but seeing that felt like my powers was completely stopped away from me again. I just feel so anxious and on edge now. It‚Äôs been almost 3 years and I thought I healed. 

Not sure what to do anymore. Just wanted to vent I guess."	creme_pop	post	35.1884003363209	male	White	0.9986512064933777	na	na	na	2	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"I can completely understand how triggering that is and I had a similar issue a while ago. I think Instagram now has an option to block an account and all the future accounts this person will create with the same email address. So maybe that's a calming thought ? Maybe start over with a new account yourself ? But that way you would have to actively search for his accounts to block them :/

"Trigger warning for traffic accident details !

I recently completed trauma therapy for dealing with SA and I'm happy to say that I'm healing. I'm managing the intrusions pretty well since doing trauma therapy and really profited.

Two days ago I witnessed a tragic traffic accident where a speeding car crashed into a tram (?) stop and injured three teenagers badly. I ran up there and helped of the teenagers by holding his hand and talking to him until the paramedics arrived then assisting them. I won't go into detail but the boy was in a critical state and had serious injuries. I'm a nurse so I usually don't have any issues with seeing large amounts of blood or people in pain but this was different. I keep seeing his terrified eyes, the blood and hear his screams but it's different from the actual intrusions I'm used to. However I have a hard time using the tools I learned in therapy for some reason and my therapist is only available next week. 

Do you have any tips or recommendations on how to act fast so I can process this healthily ? Idk if I'm overreacting but I'm actually terrified of dealing with ptsd again.

"TW: accident, hospital etc.



I was in a traumatic accident 3 years ago. In the first 2 years I processed a lot and it was for the first year and half or so a bit part of my personality. (Also because the medical recovering process took 2 years) For a year now I have become fine with it and it isn't a thing I tell people anymore. 
The 'anniversary' was 16th June and since then it's kinda back. I think it's also cause I realised there is maybe trauma left in my body, especially in my hips and I started doing research for it. That would explain my back pain etc. And when I was hospitalized one of the traumtic things for me was a catheter. This could have a big influence on my pelvic and hips regio.

I also have sudden cry sessions when a little setback happens. Like I can't cope with setbacks. I tell myself crying isnt bad and a part of it and its going to be okay.

My guess there is just trauma stored in my body and especially my hips. Do you guys experience this? And how have you dealt with it?

This was most definitely sexual assault. You did not consent to it and that was clear when you were  not sitting down. He KICKED you to get you to sit down.

I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you. It absolutely sounds like sexual assault to me. His later actions show that he wasn‚Äôt looking for or cared about your consent. Given this I don‚Äôt know how helpful fixating on whether the first event was or wasn‚Äôt assault is helpful. It absolutely sounds like sexual assault but even if it wasn‚Äôt because of some legal loophole this individual would have sexual assaulted you if you had said no.

"So basically this is the whole situation

Short Version


It was a guy, and I met up with him. And when I met with him and we started talking for alittle while. He asked me if Im ok with watching him jerk off. ( I didn't mind that) so I agreed. But After that he asked me to give him head.



¬†I told him no.


And he was upset. And told me that I'm gave him (blue balls). And I told him that I was sorry about that.



¬†Then he started leaning to basically trying to touching my chest. I told him that I wasn't interested and I got up and Then, while I was about to walk away, he grabbed my arm‚Ä¶



THEN he told me¬† to sit down, and (I didn‚Äôt want to,) so i didn‚Äôt and then he asked me again, but this time ( in a more demanding tone). (I still didn't want to sit down. So i didn‚Äôt. Then he kick my leg causing me to fall onto his lap And he would held me tight in a holding position causing it to be hard for me to move away from him.




He started to touch my ( virgina) rubbing it. And I tried to move his hand away, but he put pressure.... Making it hard for me to move his hand.



When I manage to move his hand, he started pulling my pants down, but I tried to pull my pants back up. But he kept pulling it down.¬†


¬†Then, I said no. ( But in a really low-toned voice. ) Then after I said it. I heard him say that he was gonna put it in.)


Then I told him I wanted to go home more than once. But he didn't listen to me and he didn't let me go.



He ended up putting himself inside of me from behind.üòï ( Not all the way but alittle bit)¬†



I started yelling him that he was hurting me. - (said it twice.)




After he did that to me. We heard someone from the park and he let me go and grabbed my personal belongings that had my SSN and birth certificate in my bag.


And he went somewhere in a darker area. And I only followed him to get my stuff back.



And when I got to him he had my stuff right by him. And I was really concerned at this time and I didn't want him to do anything else crazy. Soo... I thought if I play ( show him that I'm not scared of him) that he wouldn't hurt me worse.



Soo... I sat next to him.¬†



But then he started touching my chest and I was trying to get him off of me. But he held me so tight we ended up falling to the ground.



And I asked him not to hurt me-( twice.)


(He told me that he wouldn't hurt me, but he didn't let go of me.



And then I tried using the bench to get up.

But then he started to kiss me and pull my pants off on the bench. And then I tried to move my body back away from him but he moved on me and started to do it to me.



And question??? Does this experience I had matters or should I just forget about how

¬†I feel because it's basically not ""real rape‚Äî-Says my ex bf)


¬†My ex told me that this situation is basically not real rape‚Ä¶.. and basically saying I'm crying/ acting so upset about it and always wanting to talk about it for support ‚Äîlike it was the worst rape in the world‚Ä¶( then he goes and say.. I wasn't beated, threatened, and I didn't yell or fight back‚Ä¶)--- and basically saying he don't understand why I'm keep wanting to talk about it‚Ä¶. And basically saying that I need to accept the Truth ‚Äî- that it wasn't all that bad.

"I‚Äôm (26f) not sure what to think of this. I went through childhood abuse from my mum and all through my life my dad has been the most loving, stable, kind, generous person to me. He himself was and still is controlled by my mum. After posting on here with a question about things that happened with my mother I am now almost certain that she sexual abused me to. I still have dreams or intrusive memories about things that definitely happened between her and me. 

What is stressing me is reoccurring dreams of oral sex with my dad. In the dreams I am young and innocent without any understanding of what is going on. I am obviously disturbed/disgusted by them and wake up confused and stressed. I maybe have a dream like this 3 times a month. I won‚Äôt lie, I am concerned that these dreams are actually memories that happened or are dreams but based on reality. I love my dad and can‚Äôt imagine he would ever but it‚Äôs hard to ignore. 

What I do know is from a young age around 6/7 I showed signs of age regression (a term I learnt on here from anther post - the age regression would have been there anyway with what my mum was doing to me). I know that I feel extremely uncomfortable /totally avoid talking to my dad about the following topics periods/tampons/bras/staying over at bfs/having children/women‚Äôs appearance/sex/female genitalia/breasts etc. and my sister doesn‚Äôt have any issues with talking about this with him. I have also always felt uncomfortable in bikinis around him where my sister doesn‚Äôt. I know this is likely common with most girls and their dads but I just wondered if there was more to this. 

I have also recently started taking Citalopram so this could be making dreams more vivid maybe although I‚Äôve had these dreams for 2/3 years. 

I do have a CBT therapist , who isn‚Äôt really equipped for trauma work so I don‚Äôt have a professional I can ask so I wondered if anyone had gone through something similar and if reoccurring dreams ever meant something? Or if a therapist thought they meant something else? Or if they didn‚Äôt mean anything and stopped after you did something?"

"As a child, the ‚Äúenergy‚Äù of your parents is sort of perceived as one thing. They both are influencing your well being. It‚Äôs really possible that the abuse from your mom in tandem with genuine love from your dad has produced a sort of unconscious convergence of the two experiences. This happens all the time in dreams. Being in one place from one time in your life‚Ä¶with elements from another time of your life.

If you were sexually abused in general, it makes sense why you‚Äôd feel unsafe wearing a bikini around your dad. 

After all, you wanted to keep your relationship with him intact/safe. By experience, you learned early on that one of your parents could take advantage of you sexually. So by creating protective barriers/boundaries, you kept yourself safe, as well as the good relationship you had with your dad.

Before stating this, I should say I am no expert. As someone who is a survivor of sexual abuse, I‚Äôve had dreams similar to these involving different family members that weren‚Äôt involved with the abuse in any way. Unless you are able to accurately recount that this happened to you consciously, I would not try to say it‚Äôs. A memory. It could be, but unless you are able to recount precise details, it could just be your subconscious using it to process your trauma. You saw your dad as safe, and were sexualized at a young age. You‚Äôre brain is going to always see through that lens. I suggest finding a trauma informed therapist, that what has helped me.

"So I'm seeing my uncle today (don't see him very often) at a family party. 

So when I was 16 I was walking up my street back to my house and my dad and uncle were in a car also driving back to my house. Apparently my uncle started telling my dad to check out the hot girl walking up our street (me) and making gross comments. My dad told him he was checking out his niece and my uncle acted surprised. 

Well, my uncle told me about what happened and would bring up this incident every time he saw me for at least a year after. It would always make me feel uncomfortable. Then at 16 or 17 I remember saying to my parents that I thought older boys were cute (meaning like 18 year olds) and my uncle jumped in and said he was an older man (he was 40 something). 

I'm 37 now and a mom and I brushed it off as a kid as no big deal and I'm not scarred by it or anything but as an adult with kids I can't fathom saying something like that to my teen nephew. It's fucked up. 

Not sure what im looking for here other to get it out. I know this is no big deal compared to other stuff  and other traumas ive been through but I'm an adult now and this is weird right?"

"TLDR: my uncle added a suggestive comment to a joke and I feel weird about it 

I have this memory from a few years ago that‚Äôs been popping up a lot recently. I think it‚Äôs tied to some repressed trauma that I‚Äôm starting to work on, but I‚Äôm just wondering how normal (or not) this interaction seems. 

So I was visiting my aunt and uncle a few years back and I showed them a picture of a guy I had just started seeing at the time. In the picture, the guy was with his dad and my aunt wondered which man was I was trying to show her. I (and the guy) was 22 at the time so it then turned into a joke about me dating someone in their 60s. 

Then my uncle comes up behind me and hums my name suggestively. Everyone continues to laugh and I am throughly uncomfortable. I‚Äôm sensitive to innuendos in general, but it just seems weird to me that a family member would make this kind of comment. 

The repressed trauma i mentioned earlier is also related family and I‚Äôve been trying to figure out who all was involved. Part of me wonders if this has any connection, especially since it‚Äôs getting stuck in my head so much. But it would just be helpful to know that other people think this whole interaction was weird too :/"	Primary-Audience-205	post	22.52901513659601	male	White	0.9985141158103943	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"Eight months ago I have had some friendship drama. We were a group of 3 friends for 1 year. They were not great at communicating and quite insecure (which is fine, depending on how it expresses itself). Sometimes they would speak to each other about something that I had said and that they misinterpreted, and draw conclusions on my character. They would talk to other people about it, our mutual colleagues, friends, I would usually be the last one to hear about it and get the chance to discuss what was said and what it meant. To my face they wouldn't say anything and be real nice. I got to know all that after we parted ways. I thought we were very close friends. As a sidenote they would always come to me for advice, and they told me they appreciated my mostly nuanced and differentiated opinion, as well as the diplomatic way I usually express myself. Sometimes one of these friends would come and tell me ""I was so upset with you last week when you said this and that, but now I'm better"", which felt unfair especially since I see myself as very open to criticism and feedback. It felt like I was given no grace and immediate conclusions were drawn without the chance of being heard. We ended up having a huge fallout that was the epitome of this. I felt like my entire vision of what we had was completely wrong and the whole thing was a lie. I separated myself from them after that. Since that happened, I have had trust issues with people, especially the people I am fully myself with and vulnerable with. Any time I leave an interaction with someone, even with my best friends, my family, I get this sinking feeling like I'm being misunderstood, something I say might be picked, analyzed and misinterpreted, and the person might run with it and ultimately gossip about me, reject or betray me. I tend to feel like I won't be given any benefit of the doubt. I've heard it's very common for people who have been the subject of false rumours or cheating for example to have these fears? I have been working on it since it happened, but I feel like it takes time and is making me question relationships that I fully trusted before. I am also not trusting the way I view things as much. I now tend to overthink interactions, overexplain what I meant, doubt my closed ones, and it gets tiring. I had healed this anxious part of me and it has been reactivated. I feel like, at any point I could realize that even the closest persons to me can paint me as a bad person and betray me after one sentence. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells, even in situations where I shouldn't feel like this. I am aware how irrational that is, so if you have been through something similar I'm curious to get some perspectives, and maybe get some mantras, concepts, ideas, notions that helped you in your work towards healing this part of yourself? (apart from therapy, which is not an option at this moment but is in the pipeline. Looking for different perspectives right now:)) "	Cynthincident	post	19.848789798317245	female	White	0.9980012774467468	na	na	na	3	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"Here is an incident from when I(23f) was 10yo. I used to go to my next door neighbours to play with a little girl. She was 1yo then. When I was playing with her, usually her mother or grandmother or father was there with us. Other times they would be in the other room doing chores and sometimes come to check up on us. It's normal, all good. 

One day I was with her alone in the room playing with her toys. Her dad was in the other room. Sometimes he would stand near the door to check up on us. But when I felt his presence and looked up towards the door, he would hide back. I felt maybe he didn't want to make me feel like he was spying on us so he hide himself. It happened a few times so I just assumed that it must be the case.

But after a few days I was in the same situation. I was with the girl playing with her and her toys. I was sitting on the edge of the bed with my legs crossed. I had some issue with one of her toys so her dad came in to help me out with it. He stood next to me and was looking at the toy and I was then handling the girl. All of a sudden, I felt something on my foot with was little bit hanging off the bed. I remember the feeling it felt weird, warm and soft. I was afraid and tried to look with the corner of my eye. I do not remember what happened to me but I cannot remember what I saw.

That incident, I still remember but I am not sure about it. Now that I have grown up and know a lot about things, I still get terrified thinking about it. I don't know if it was nothing or if it was SOMETHING. If it was nothing, why can't I forget it? I want to live peacefully knowing that there was nothing to be worried about. But then I am also afraid to know the truth, what ifs....

I want to talk about this with my bf. But I am not sure what to say. What if I am just overthinking things and making it all up. Well at least I know one thing now, that if someone walking by would stand at my door even for 1 second, my heart would start running fast. 

I don't know what to do about it. It's been so many years and it still kind of haunts me."	thelittlemisscat	post	24.65146854233158	female	White	0.9859041571617126	na	na	na	4	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

I don't know how long ago this happened but if it was in the last few days you should go to an urgent care NOW and get on prophylactics because they can prevent it from taking hold.

If it was longer ago than that, and you do have HIV, the future is not so grim. You'd have to take meds for it from now on, but other than that, it's very low risk of developing into AIDS, and even low risk of transmission to other people once managed.

"I'm so sorry, that's a shitty situation and waiting is really scary. I've been there before, it can feel endless to wait for the results. 
Maybe you can try to do something relaxing, something nice to calm down and breathe in the meantime? 

First: no matter what others did to you, no matter which experiences you had, voluntarily or not, this does not define your sexuality. Asexuality means not being interested in sex to some degree and this sexuality doesn't suddenly change because of a persons violent sexual act. 

You are still asexual as long as you feel that this defines you. You choose your sexuality and only you choose any changes to that - because it's what you feel, not how you act and most certainly not what others do to you.
Also, asexuality is a spectrum, it's not yes or no, so you could for example have sex a couple of times, realize that it's not for you and be indifferent to that. 

But sex is only the voluntary act. Rape is not sex, rape is rape. You haven't had sex, a person has acted out violence towards you. This is a huge difference. 

Also, if you decide to one day have sex, it is still possible. As far as I know there is medication for an HIV diagnosis which makes it possible to have sex without further spreading the virus (although using further protection is still necessary and always sensible). 
Luckily, as other people already said, the prognosis is good! HIV is not the same as AIDS - it's the virus residing in the body, and can often be controlled with medication. 
Many people live a life relatively unaffected apart from medication and regular doctors appointments."	FunAd7699	reply	na	na	na	0.9763160347938538	strong	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏ètrigger warning SA and ED‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
For context my sister is (23f) and I‚Äôm (17f). I guess I‚Äôll start from the beginning growing up my sister has always made negative comments about my appearance. Going into kindergarten she would comment on how ‚Äúflat‚Äù my face was and how unsymmetrical my face looked. This took a toll on me. I started comparing myself to others. I thought I was the ugliest girl to ever exist. I had a friend named Emma she was pretty and had many friends and she also had bangs. I thought maybe if I got bangs I would look pretty like her and everyone would like me and my sister would be nicer to me. That didn‚Äôt work out because I ended up looking like a rat. After kindergarten my sister moved to commenting about my body. She would torment me by saying I was flat, had broad shoulders, was fat, and looked like a man that‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt been asked out yet. I was 7. I would cry myself to bed and had lost all my confidence. I hated myself. This continued and in 4th grade she encouraged me to work out 1-2 hours a day and restrict my eating. Which I did. All of this led me to depression and suicidal thoughts. I started self harming and tried to commit. In 6th grade I was SA by a group of boys. I told my sister what happened, as I need adult guidance but was afraid to tell my parents. She said she was surprised that someone found me attractive and told me to get it her room. After that I beg to be homeschooled because I couldn‚Äôt stand seeing them everyday especially after they threatened to tell everyone I was lying if I came out with the truth. During homeschooling I gained weight. I felt like I didn‚Äôt have to impress anyone. I wanted to enjoy this new profound sense of freedom. After 8th grade my sister moved in with her poopy boyfriend (now husband). I felt free from her. But her comments followed me. I decided to go back to school in person at a private school. There I felt like everyone was watching me and the weight I gained. My sister‚Äôs lies played  none stop in my head. This would be the beginning of my ED. I had lost so much weight in a short period of time. I completely ruined my body. My ribs were visible, my period is still messed up even after being in recovery, I know still feel vomit when I look at myself on the mirror in the bathroom, would pass out for a couple of seconds, I had forgotten the feeling of hungry, I was losing hair and so much more. After a few years of my sister moving out she calls me everyday pretending everything was just right between us. She claimed she has no one to talk to and has been feeling depressed and lonely since becoming a stay at home wife. I talked with her because I felt bad because I knew what it was like to be in that circumstance and thought if I built this relationship with her I can heal from my past and move on. But mostly because my mom forced me.Talking to her is a pain she always reverts anything back to herself. I could tell her how crap my day was and she‚Äôd say ‚Äúok anyways‚Ä¶‚Äù. I‚Äôve stopped talking to her completely. She keeps trying to call me. My mom says I should forgive and more on since we are all family and family should never turn their back on one another. Plus I‚Äôm Catholic and I need to forgive in order to be forgiven but I don‚Äôt know if I can or where to start. I hate her. I couldn‚Äôt like her even if my life depended on it. I don‚Äôt know why I should listen to her problems everyday when she created mine. But at the same time I want to move on and not carry this weight with me. I want closure on why she did what she did but I‚Äôm scared to ask her. I don‚Äôt know what to do HELP."

"If you're conflicted between your religious beliefs and your emotional needs I recommend taking this to r/OpenChristian, they're very good at understanding the  path that is being Christian while traumatised.

Personally I think you should take care of your own mental health and stop talking to her. Tell your mother that your sister turned her back on you and hasn't repented, you're just protecting yourself from her hurtful words. Nowhere in the Bible does it say to sacrifice yourself for other people's feelings - forgiveness is what you do in your own time between you and God. Feel no rush to do so. Remember God loves and prioritises you too and He doesn't intend for your sister to dominate you, which is what she's always done. Your mum needs to take your side, not try to pretend everything is OK, as the scales are not fairly balanced right now. It doesn't sound like your sister is going to change on her own initiative.

You dont have to forgive her if you don‚Äôt want to. If you find that forgiving her would help you heal, do what you must, but you are not obligated.	SantaWings	reply	na	na	na	0.9862684011459351	weak	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"Wait, doesn't even god require people to sincerely repent before forgiving them? Your sister has absolutely not sincerely repented, so it would be ridiculous to say you should be more forgiving than god.

Personally I think the pressure to forgive is bullshit. It's not true forgiveness if it's forced and it cheapens the entire concept of forgiveness. I think true forgiveness, the thing that can only happen when the person who did wrong takes responsibility for what they did, sincerely apologizes, shares their plan to make sure they never do it again, and makes amends to the extent that's possible, is a beautiful thing, but that's only possible when the wrongdoer does their part. 

I firmly believe that handing out ""forgiveness"" to any random asshole who has never even admitted they did anything wrong, let alone made amends for it, is morally wrong the same way handing out a university degree to somebody who failed half of their courses because they were out partying is wrong - it's just insulting to everyone who actually did the work.

>I want closure on why she did what she did but I‚Äôm scared to ask her.

"so, i'll get right into it, i got a leukemia/blood cancer with a heckton of severe complications when i was 12yo (21 now).
and i absolutely never, ever think about it or feel any type of way about it. i've had other traumatizing events happening in my life that left me with PTSD, yet getting a cancer isn't one of them... i just feel very desensitized about all of it. whenever i tell people about it, i just feel like i'm recaping my patient file on ""autopilot"" mode.
that's something that didn't even feel weird to me up until recently when my best friend (who was the only person to be here for me throughout all of that) told me she still had nightmares about it to this day.
have i not been traumatized by that experience then? or am i just mentally shielding myself from this trauma?
my therapist also thinks that's weird, but he never pushed me to talk about it.

If you don‚Äôt feel traumatised by the situation, I would take it just as that. If it‚Äôs not causing you any harm, I don‚Äôt see the issue in just letting it be. But if it ever one day resurfaces, you can always revisit it with your therapist and work through it. 

I also found that when I was the most deep in my trauma, the ‚Äúbigger‚Äù things weren‚Äôt really an issue, and it was like my brain was trying to deal with the smaller stuff so it had more capacity to deal with the bigger things.

"The hallmarks of trauma vs not-trauma to me are whether there are painful ""sense memories"" that can come up when reminded by similar sensory situations and which bring with it some emotional tone but aren't connected into a coherent whole, vs if you have more of a ""narrative memory"" of what happened where the memories are strung together into a coherent story that can be told. Narrative memory is what's formed under normal processing, whereas sense memories are the kinds of memories that form when processing wasn't able to transform them into narratives properly because of trauma blocking that process.

Lingering sense memories that aren't part of a coherent narrative are a sign to me that there is some lingering trauma-stuff to process.

Hey.

A close friend and coworker of mine tried to rape me.

"To me it sounds like it could be 2 things. 

1) Denial. This is very common and it‚Äôs one of the stages of grief. I lost a few family members and a best friend when I was younger and I never reacted to their deaths or felt any emotions like you said. Then years later, I would break down crying thinking about them. There is no time frame when it comes to mourning so some people can get stuck in one of the stages for a long time. Especially younger people / children because they may not know how to process those things quite yet. The feelings come back up when you are ready and able to process the emotions.

2) Dissociation. This usually happens in more severe trauma cases as the brain‚Äôs natural response to try to protect you. During a traumatic experience (or an ongoing experience) a person can become so overloaded with emotion that their brain will shut down as a coping mechanism. Some symptoms include memory issues (not being able to remember what happened or black out during traumatic experience) or feeling disconnected from reality like you are living in a fake world. 

I think it depends on the type/ severity level of your trauma. (I don‚Äôt believe in comparing one persons trauma to another because we are complex beings with different understandings of emotion and tenacity. So different people can respond differently to the same kinds of traumas, one persons trauma isn‚Äôt more severe than the other, etc.) if you feel the situation was very traumatic for you, then you could have disassociated until your brain knew for sure you were in a safe environment to start processing emotions again.

But do your own research, this should give you a good starting point. Sending love to you! Processing trauma is a bumpy road."	JelloHorror7148	reply	na	na	na	0.9960073828697205	weak	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"There could be a clinical explanation, but it can also be that you learned new things or living your life differently led to you realizing just how fucked up it was.

One of my favorite songs is about getting out of a traumatic relationship, saying (paraphrasing) ""I swear things were better and *I* was better before I learned what I experienced was actually [insert traumatic negative experience]."" 


If you think about kids, they don't have any conceptions of things to really be in denial like adults can, and this sort of thing can happen to kids as they age and reexamine what they've been thru. It can also be why people look back on their upbringing and are like (as an example) ""ah ok so I understand now my family is super racist and that makes me uncomfortable now."" They weren't really in denial because they had no other conception of the way things could be."	JelloHorror7148	reply	na	na	na	0.9960073828697205	no	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
Thank you, this definitely gives me a jumping off point to look into some things!

You will be okay some day. Maybe you aren't ready to let go yet, that's okay. You can weather this storm. This will not last forever. Just get through tonight. What you are experiencing is a human reaction, you are a part of humanity. It feels awful and its unpleasant, but it's okay to feel this way. You are okay. I know it's hard. I know its awful. I'm sorry you are going through this. You will get through this. You are strong. Its also okay to be weak. Do what you can to comfort yourself. Pretend you are a little kid and console yourself.

Trauma is a human reaction, there is nothing wrong with you. Your body is reacting in its own very natural way, trying to protect you and trying to process.

"For some additional information: I‚Äôm a 14 year old female, and I live in a small town. I have been sexually assaulted three times, and haven‚Äôt gotten over the trauma yet. No one knows what happened and I plan to keep it that way for a long time.
 
I am constantly harassed, grabbed, and catcalled in public. I wear unflattering baggy clothes every day in hopes that it will stop, but no matter what I do these men will not leave me alone. My friends can wear shorts and a tank top and not have these problems, and I‚Äôm starting to wonder what I‚Äôm doing wrong. I feel like I might have a panic attack every time I get grabbed and that I can‚Äôt even go out anymore. It‚Äôs normal for kids to go out on their own around here because it‚Äôs a small town. I know it‚Äôs not anything I say because I‚Äôm incredibly shy. I‚Äôm so shy that a group of kids thought I was mute for a couple of weeks, and the only reason they found out I wasn‚Äôt mute was because when someone asked me if I was, I shook my head no. Nothing that I do 
 makes it go away, even if I wear baggy clothes and never talk. I don‚Äôt know what is wrong with me but I would do anything to make it stop. These men need to leave me alone (it‚Äôs adults and minors that are doing it). 
I‚Äôm so disgusted and disappointed with all these people. I just want to be normal like everyone else my age. My friends have never had this problem and I wish I could be like them. I‚Äôm absolutely terrified of most men and boys that are bigger than me because of my trauma, so every time I go outside it feels like I‚Äôm about to start panicking. I have made some steps in the right direction with my fear of kids that are bigger than me, but only kids close to my age. If they are over 15 then I will still be afraid, but it‚Äôs an improvement form how I was. I wish that these people would just mind their own business and leave me alone, but that isn‚Äôt working out for me right now."

"Here is something i learned that may answer your question of WHY? Predatory ppl have a very good sense and ability to be able to pick out their victims... like a shark can smell a drop of blood, they can sense that you have been victimized before, and that makes you a target. 

It's not about the clothes you wear, how you look, or any outward appearance. I have been in your position, and you can overcome it.

My best advice is GET MAD! Find your voice and use it! YELL, SCREAM, AND SHOUT anytime anyone touches you, cat calls you, speaks to you inappropriately, or does anything that makes you uncomfortable. Scream it from the rooftops...   your meekness is your weakest point."	Express_Presence_723	reply	na	na	na	0.9988225102424622	no	no	strong	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

I know small towns are tough and sometimes there‚Äôs a culture of misogyny, etc, where bad behavior is normalized. Is there an adult in your life who you know doesn‚Äôt condone that behavior?

"I (15 AFAB) noticed that my romantic attraction had faded around March 2022, wasn‚Äôt sure why at the time but eventually came to the realization that it was because of my relationship earlier that year. The relationship lasted less than two months, and I had been SA‚Äôd multiple times during the relationship and physically assaulted daily after we had broken up, which of course led me into a downward spiral of depression, self harm, and anxiety. The harassment eventually stopped around late April or early March. I got into another relationship late August, it was perfect at the start but issues started emerging around two months in, didn‚Äôt realize until long after we had broken up but he had SA‚Äôd me as well. Both of my abusers later decided to ‚Äúteam up‚Äù and exposed compromising photos of me, threatened violence, etc. 

I‚Äôve been trying to find ways to possibly heal from these experiences as I do desire a romantic relationship, just simply can‚Äôt feel any of the attraction. I haven‚Äôt been very successful in my research, so does anyone have any ideas or advice on how I might be able to regain it over time? Not used to posting on here so apologies if there are any issues. Thank you to anyone who may take the time to read this, I honestly really needed to get this off my chest. 

TL;DR: Lost all romantic attraction due to bad relationships and incidents after they had ended, looking for any advice or ideas on how to heal and eventually regain it

EDIT: recently agreed to join a threesome with my best friends so nvm I think I‚Äôm doing pretty good on my own after all

I‚Äôd likely be coming back multiple times because let‚Äôs me honest I‚Äôm a mess. And I don‚Äôt have anyone I can truly tell my story to. Or actually get advice on how to stop constantly reliving my trauma. So let me start at the beginning. As far back as I can remember I‚Äôve been abused. I know cliche.  I‚Äôve been physically, emotionally and sexually abused as far back as I can remember. I don‚Äôt really remember anything good. I was never protected by the ones that should have. My days consisted of reading, cleaning, school or beatings. I‚Äôd get beat for laughing, or living for that matter. My dad was a Drill Sergeant and that‚Äôs how he ran his home.  I have a brother and Sister, they to were horribly abused. My brother left as soon as he can to the military. My sister had to go live with my aunt because she turned our dad into DYFS ‚ÄúCPS‚Äù. So I was all alone.  I wasn‚Äôt safe anywhere.  I‚Äôd go to my aunts and my cousins would molest me. I‚Äôd come home and be beat constantly the only place I felt safe at school I would make any excuse to stay later anything just to stay with my teacher. My school caught on about the abuse and contacted CPS again. I was in and out of foster houses for a while, but they always put me back in the with my monster. I would constantly dream of ways to kill myself and I couldn‚Äôt even get that right. I was super hyper-sexual. I craved love or what I thought was love. Looking back god I was so lost. I was taken advantage my older men all the time. I swear I had a beacon on my head for abusive assholes. I fell pregnant very young. I was in absolute heaven why I don‚Äôt know o was like 14/15 my timelines are screwy so bare with me. The feeling of the butterflies and the immediate love I felt was absolutely insane. O rubbed her constantly- my soul told me she was a girl. I even had a name. Lotus. I made the most na√Øve mistake and told my mom. She of course couldn‚Äôt keep it a secret like I begged her to. She told my dad and he beat the ever living shit out of me. He kept trying to kick my stomach it I kept protecting her. They ultimately took me in for an abortion. I‚Äôll never forget that loss. Seeing her and feeling them cut her up to suction her out. I mourn her constantly. She plays a big piece of my future, I‚Äôll get there later. From that moment on I felt absolutely dead inside. My dad would constantly tell me since I was a little girl how much he hated me, wished me dead and he would spit on me and call me the most degrading names. I never even knew what those words were until I grew up. He told me he tried to beat me out my mothers womb but it didn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôd wish it had. I always prayed my mother would have the strength to save us all and take us away from him. She was deathly scared herself. He was smart he got her when she was like 17 she didn‚Äôt know English or the US so he knew what he was doing. I used to blame her for not saving us. But what would she have done. She had no money, no education, no friends. I‚Äôll come back and keep going but I need some sleep. This is so therapeutic. Thanks for listening.

"My (25m) birthday is today, July 1st, and I've spiraled into the worst depression spell I've ever had since I was 16. I have a lot of trauma ever since I was 6 and I've struggled with depression, stress, and anxiety since then. I'm not sure how to go about this, and I apologize for ranting, but I really want some advice that may work for me. Anything would be nice even a ""Hang in there!"" would be nice.

In truth I'm a swirl of emotions, which leaves me feeling floaty and tired, and don't really know what to do. I bought myself a chocolate lava cake, gave a small notice to friends who didn't know it was my birthday, and lay in bed in pain with a severe migraine from stress.

I have a lot of traumas and it's from family, ex-friends, ex-loves, and strangers. Bullying, Emotional/physical abuse, manipulation, stealing possessions, abuse of kindness, belittling what little progress I make, homelessness, starvation, being replaced, and the list goes on and on. I don't really know how to talk about it as I'm trying to talk with a therapist again, but it's frustrating and leaves me feeling stressed. 

Yesterday I was upset about my birthday coming up and a coworker tried prying into what was going on ans kept insisting. I declined and told her to stop prying, but eventually she decided she didn't want to work with me since I wouldn't share. I now have to see my boss Monday as she contacted to help line and left during that job. Leaving me to finish the job and nearly go into a full blown panic attack I've been holding off all week. I bottled it and finished the job.

I'm not well, but I'm not suicidal if that's any silver lining. I'm just... Lost. It also hurts trying to think as my head keeps thinking and how I'm 25 today. I'm sorry again for rambling, but thank you to anyone who was willing to read."

"Happy birthday man! I hope next one will be much happier though.

Do you remember what you wanted to have or to try as a child? Do you still want it now? Like if you really wanted to play drums, or bike somewhere on the weekend, or binge watch something, or get a cat? So treat yourself like you would treat this child.

About your coworker: you did nothing wrong and she is acting weird. Write down what happened, all the details. And write down what you want to say to your boss. You don't owe her to talk about your private life, and you don't have to do her job when she feels like it. Is it possible to switch to another team? Rehearse in front of the mirror a couple times what you want to say. Bring these notes with you, so you will not get stuck if you get too anxious when talking with the boss. I hope it will go well and there will be one less reason for stress in your life.

This sub is not very active, posts usually get just a few comments here. There are more popular and more helpful ones: 

r/cptsdnextsteps

r/cptsd_nscommunity

r/CPTSD

People there might have more ideas.

So you have therapist already, or are you thinking about it? If you have - explain them that you are frustrated by talk therapy, and what else can they recommend: IFS, EMDR, somatic therapy, grounding techniques, TMS, medication?

If you don't - look at these types of therapy. Look at the related subs, read books about them. (Z-library has them all for free)

TMS is not a therapy, it is a medical device, and it helped me a lot. Really a lot. Medication could be a good option, nothing wrong with it, and if your doctor will get them right they will stabilize you fast.

It looks like you have strong somatic response to stress, so I assume (I am not a therapist at all) that somatic therapy will help you the best. And not just therapy but anything that will make your body feel good, like massage (you can learn self neck and shoulders massage, or you can find a massage school nearby, they need people to train their skills on, so their prices is very low), hot/cold showers, sauna, grounding techniques, butterfly hug, swimming, walking on the grass/sand/rocks.... Idk, anything you enjoy.

The sub about it is r/somaticexperiencing

If you want I can send you links to grounding techniques, support groups, AI therapist bots... I just don't want to write too much if you already tried it.

"I have a weird trigger. The smell of blood makes me ""remember"" something I attribute to a nightmare. When I was in highschool, it was before Halloween, there was a person dressed as a leprechaun walking around being sassy. I remember seeing him, and having the urge to call someone to tell on him. I got a phone from a classmate, diled a number and said ""there's a leprechaun at school using magic"". I then waited in the quad about 10 mins and saw a tall man with a grey mustache in a black suit approach me. He asked, ""where?!"", I pointed in the direction I saw him and he left me. Not a minute goes by and I see a group of classmates in front of me look in his direction with absolute horror on their faces. I don't move, but keep looking at them as I hear screaming. The man comes back with a bloody knife in his hand and says to me ""good god, thank you for telling me""(I think he thought I was God). When he left I walk over to where he was and saw a body on the ground and a head on a bench with blood everywhere.
I remember an ambulance rolling up to the school. I tried to tell the front office what I saw, but everyone looked down at their desk. So I said out loud ""you won't talk because snitches die, right?! That's fucking right snitches die."" And left.
I randomly cry about it, and it was over 15 years ago. I'm not sure if it was a nightmare or reality, but don't know what to do to cope with it."	ConclusionPrevious79	post	29.28089519945498	male	White	0.992653489112854	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	failed

"I‚Äôm currently 18 turning 19 in a few weeks, but about a little over a year ago I was driving down a highway following a motorcycle. We were going about 110 kmh (68 mph) there was two people in the bike. After about 10 minutes ish the bike started to steer off to the side and it flipped over, both people were ejected from the bike. The driver was thrown into the woods and the passenger slid down the side of the road at least 50 meters. I immediately pulled over and so did the car behind me; the driver behind me was panicking and said she just got her license and didn‚Äôt know what to do, so I told her just to call 911. 

I first went to the driver and you know when you see pictures and videos, movies and stuff and people are badly injured and it makes you cringe. It‚Äôs not the same in person especially in the state he was in. He had hit his head on a tree, the helmet was in thousands of shards some imbedded in the tree. His blood and brains were everywhere. I went up to him and just incase I checked for a pulse and nothing.

I proceeded to attend the passenger who was just a 10 year old girl. She stud up on her own before I got there and she was just screaming, I don‚Äôt blame her. I told her to look at the trees on the other side of the road so she wouldn‚Äôt look at her father‚Äôs body. We walked back to my car and she had a seat on the hood; it was on that walk back I realized how severe her injuries were. The back of her jacket was shredded and the same with her skin. At that time the police started showing up and took over. 

She was immediately sent in the first ambulance and they thought he might survive the head trauma so he was air lifted to the hospital. The little girl survived but the father died. And in all honesty I don‚Äôt know why they thought he might have a chance but it‚Äôs hard to be hopeful when there‚Äôs half a head in a busted helmet.

After I had given my statements to the police I drove to McDonald‚Äôs and cleaned my arms hands and face from the blood. I sat down for a bite to eat. I was literally in tears the whole time and shaking violently. When I was done I finished driving home and I took my sweater off and put it in the trunk of the car. I had to take the garden hose to clean the blood of the hood. 

Other then this post I have told one person. I didn‚Äôt sleep for 6 days after. And I threw up so many times that day that I was just puking blood. When I finished my grade 12 year I took a break from driving for 3 months. When I went back to it I threw up just by being in the car. 

I used to convince myself that it was my cousin that whitenesed the accident and what I was picturing was just what I thought it looked like.
There are no words to properly describe the pain I felt and still feel. There are no words to describe what the little girl felt. I don‚Äôt know why I chose now to tell this but I think it‚Äôs that before I didn‚Äôt want to share the pain it was better with myself.

I'm really sorry you're feeling this pressure and experiencing this anxiety. It's really important to prioritize your feelings and needs in this situation. When dealing with your family, perhaps you could approach the situation from a financial perspective. Try to explain your reservations about making such a big purchase, perhaps citing financial readiness and stability. If you're not ready, it's important to communicate that clearly. If you are still scared that they'll be mad, understand why they want you to buy a car and try to come up with a compromise	MabyeMatt	reply	na	na	na	0.9946416616439819	strong	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"I need help. My psych is on vacation, he‚Äôs just like a one person office so there‚Äôs no one else I can reach out to. 

This morning while driving to work, I heard a weird noise coming from my car. My brakes have been doing weird squealing noises for a while and I also have a wee bit of the bumper coming in a little bit of contact with a tire so I thought it was that at first. But it sounded almost like very faint meowing, not exactly right but kinda, so I pulled into a parking lot and tried my best to check under my car and make sure there wasn‚Äôt a cat stuck in there. I didn‚Äôt have much time to thoroughly check because I needed to be at work, but I jostled the car around a little and banged on the car and psst pssted and didn‚Äôt hear anything further so I continued driving to work. 

I heard the noise again faintly one more time getting onto the highway, then kinda like a clunk, looked in my rear view mirror and a fucking‚Ä¶ kitten came tumbling out of im assuming my wheel well onto the highway. I didn‚Äôt see what happened after that because I had to focus so much in safely getting to a shoulder while screaming and crying and hyperventilating. I‚Äôm surprised I didn‚Äôt get in an accident. 

My husband came and did his best to calm me down, walked down the shoulder, he didn‚Äôt see anything. He went back out after I calmed down enough to drive home. Said he walked up the shoulder 3 times and didn‚Äôt see a body. He left food and water out for it incase it made it off the highway in one piece. 

I‚Äôm not a kid person. My cats are my babies. I fucking love cats, animals are sweet angels that we don‚Äôt deserve. It had to be my car. It had to be a day where I was running not early to get to work. 

When I was a teenager, my family had a kitten that they were very lax on keeping it inside if it managed to get out the front door. We live in the suburbs so there‚Äôs not a ton of traffic so basically e everyone has cats they let outside without fear of something bad happening to it. 

I would walk to school and one day I noticed the kitten had followed me. Next second, a car is speeding down the street I was walking down, a dog came charging up to its fence to bark at the kitten, the kitten got scared, ran in the street, got run over in front of me. 

I feel the exact same way I did then now. The first instance left me with lifelong insomnia. I could not close my eyes to sleep without seeing it happen over and over. I finally grew out of it but it took a year and I still have insomnia issues. 

I went to take a nap bc I was so tired from crying as hard as I was capable of, and I‚Äôm seeing the kitten tumbling into the highway, same way as before. 

What do I do? My life as a teenager was more suitable to be totally mentally broken but I have a job and a mortgage and bills now. I can‚Äôt continue crumpling and not sleeping for very long, I have too many responsibilities. 

Is there a solid way to trick my brain into not repeatedly reliving that awful moment?"	PM_ME_heartwarmth	post	27.27113494613834	female	White	0.9940892457962036	na	na	na	5	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

That would horrify me too, but I know cats are very attracted to warm places such as under the hoods of cars.

It took me a few months to go from the word 'abuse' to the word 'rape'. No one wants to think of themselves as a victim. Maybe it's because we're victim blaming.

"i think it helps to be specific. a lot of my partner's deflective behaviors and overall avoidant attachment style stems from betrayal trauma. if you talk to him about it, he'll say ""a lot of people get cheated on."" he minimizes. then he'll maximize the definition of trauma to be tangible, like ""people have their arms blown off. that's trauma."" so then it's like, everyone has trauma and also no one has trauma. the value shifts. lately our counselor has been identifying specifically that betrayal is traumatic, therefore it is trauma. it takes away the ability for self-negotiation."	begoniakat	reply	na	na	na	0.9945584535598755	no	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"I have and it did work for me. I picked a trauma specialised therapist who practice EMDR therapy alongside CBT, reality therapy, guided imagery therapy - he is also very understanding and empathetic, but knew how to push me when I needed a nudge to move forward (eg: dealing with loads of anger).

EMDR therapy specifically was very helpful because it reduced my flashbacks and emotions that came with it. It allowed me to desensitise myself to the trauma in a safe way and reprocess it into something better. In turn, it helped with the emotions and intensity I used to feel. 

It also looks at belief systems - ‚Äúi am not good enough, not worthy enough ‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚Äúi am unsafe‚Äù, challenge them and replace them with better beliefs that suit our current reality. 

I dealt with CSA from three to twelve years old - always had flashbacks, dissociation and complex emotional issues among other symptoms. I‚Äôm a few years post-therapy now and when I think of those traumatic memories, I don‚Äôt feel scared, alone or as badly as I used to. In a way, my brain has been desensitized towards it, and I can see it differently.

I have a long and extensive trauma history. But one of the events that still effects me if in 2016 my mom was hospitalized for a long time on ventilator dying of cancer. Now whenever a loved one is sick I tend to catastrophize. I went to work yesterday and my domestic partner felt sick and called out. He has been feeling under the weather and honestly just needed a day to sleep. But by 5 when I was driving home from work (an hour drive mostly in the highway) I started imaging I would find him dead in our bed when I got home. I couldn‚Äôt get the image out of my head and I almost started crying, so suddenly I began to almost fantasize about my ex-husband (who was physically abusive and landed me in the hospital a few times). I imagined him seeing my partner and me and our friends at the mall and beating the shit out of me, then my partner calling 911 and our friends holding him down until the cops came. I then fantasized he would go back to jail and I felt safe. Like I know this is all a trauma response but it helped me relax enough while driving and not worry about my partner until I got home and found he was ok.  Idk, it sounds like a maladaptive coping skill but it honestly helped me stay calm while I drove home‚Ä¶can anyone else relate?

Yes! This is touching the subject of Ideal Parental Figure Protocoll which is supposed to heal attachment styles. It works very similar: You imagine a situation in which you felt lost as a child and then you imagine a parentral figure that gives child-you exactly what it needed at that time. That's a very rough description really and it's a bit more complex, but you get the idea. So I can totally see why your daydreaming worked so well and I'm happy you found something that helped. Also, you can be proud of finding a way to protect yourself from these thoughts and it just shows your resilience.

TW: mention of sui, trauma, cancer, surgery, death

Me: late 30sF, in UK, diagnosed with BPD, MDD and GAD due to surgical menopause, and maybe PTSD (it‚Äôs been suggested but never formerly diagnosed)

TL;DR: I have unresolved trauma that is impacting my work life now, and my MH is spiralling downward for the first time in nearly 4 years (also tried posting this in [r/mentalhhealth](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhhealth/) but is pending, plus I don't know how to do the xpost thing)

I am really struggling with work at the moment. It isn‚Äôt work‚Äôs fault; I have a lot of unresolved workplace trauma from being treated terribly when my mental health has taken a bad turn, and it all seems to be flaring up right now.

7 years ago, my MH was so bad that I was a very messy person and it bled into my work life a lot; I was chaotic and challenging to be around. I was told that I was blunt and rude in how I was communicating with people when all I was talking to colleagues and managers. My brain works very straightforwardly so I am very straight to the point but I‚Äôm never trying to be difficult (neurodivergence, you know?). I was honest with my manager at the time, including when things came to a head, and I made a half-hearted suicide attempt which meant I spent a day in A&E rather than at work. My honesty resulted in being put on leave pending a psych assessment which took 6 months to actually happen, and when the results said I was fit to work with support, my employer at the time didn‚Äôt like that and I ended up having to get a 3rd party to resolve the situation. I was basically paid to leave.

5 years ago, I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had to have a total hysterectomy in my early 30s, and I am only dealing with the trauma of that now. After my hysterectomy, I woke up in recovery and the morphine was not working so I could feel where they‚Äôd cut out 3 of my organs and handled them all to check for more cancer. It took 4 hours of me lying on a bed, screaming in agony before they got the right combination of meds to stop it hurting. That trauma has had a lasting impact on my brain that has disconnected my body from feeling a lot of sensations.

I could only have 4 months off due to the laws around sick pay, so I returned to work way earlier than I was able, and I failed. I tried to get back to working properly because I loved it there, but I couldn‚Äôt handle anything. I once again was told someone had complained about me being too blunt in an email, mostly because I‚Äôd used red to highlight what I was adding. I was frustrated and severely depressed and acting poorly; I tried to get my manager to understand that I needed his support in moving that forward, but he just shrugged and told me not to do it again. My workplace failed to offer me any support for my MH, so I had to leave a job that I loved because I could not see how I could continue there.

The new job that I got was supposed to be the exciting start of my new career as it was an on-the-job training role. As the 1st anniversary of my hysterectomy approached, my trauma came back with a vengeance. My new manager dragged me hard for how my anxiety was infecting my personality; I was sharp, abrupt, and always on edge. I admit that I was problematic because I was so traumatised and had no support at the time, so I was drowning. After 6 months I was failed on my probation due to acting in a way they didn‚Äôt find appropriate.

After that incident I finally got my GP to let me start taking mood stabilisers and for the last 3.5 years, I have been able to manage my MH fairly well. Yes, I struggle with having motivation to do things and desire to move forward, and do get depressed and anxious, but I rarely breakdown or become overwhelmed by my emotions anymore (which for someone with BPD is HUGE).

However, I started my new job in March, and I the last 2 months, my mental health has started to take a serious backslide. I can feel the ‚Äúlife is pointless, why do I bother,‚Äù thoughts trying to invade my brain and my confidence is at an all time low. It‚Äôs a new role with new responsibilities and I want to smash it out of the park but right now I look like I‚Äôm not capable (IMO).

Two of my new team colleagues have told my manager that they feel like I was telling them off in a meeting last week, and one 2 weeks before told her I was too abrupt in an email. Both instances are times when I‚Äôve gone out of my way to not be seen like that and purposefully tried to modulate my language and tone to show I‚Äôm not trying to be a dick; I‚Äôm just trying to be firm. I met with my manager this morning as she wanted to know how I wanted to move forward with the situation but ever since she told me about it yesterday afternoon, I have been a wreck. I told her I needed the day to sort my shit out and come back tomorrow, ready to go. I don‚Äôt want to address the issue, especially not in front of the whole team (it was her suggestion that I bring it up in a meeting that all I want is for our team to be successful and this gets misinterpreted for being aggressive (such a sexist term)). I just want to carry on and for them to be told that it wasn‚Äôt intentional, and they should talk to me in future.

My manager got her back up about me wanting the day off because ‚Äúit‚Äôs becoming a habit and she might have to refer me to HR,‚Äù of which I reminded her that 1: the previous day and a half I had off for my MH was because MY FRIEND DIED 3 weeks ago so it was compassionate leave not sick leave, and we‚Äôre still waiting for the funeral, and 2: telling me you might have to refer me to HR to dissuade me from having a day off sick comes across as a threat when you‚Äôre saying it to someone who is already in floods of tears, and 3: sickness monitoring is at a manager‚Äôs discretion and should have more leeway when a person is struggling with their disabilities so it‚Äôs not appropriate to bring it up at this time.

She tried to push further because I should be able to take criticism (and it‚Äôll only get worse as my career progresses) and I had a full-on meltdown; I sobbed and told her all of the above stuff, and that it was making me question my future within the large countrywide organisation I work within. I explained that my prefrontal cortex logically knows that this situation isn‚Äôt a big deal and that it‚Äôs going to happen, but my amygdala is firmly convinced that something bad is now going to happen in my career (i.e., I‚Äôm going to fuck it up because I‚Äôm mentally unwell and prove to the world that I am not capable of being a leader). I just need some space to let it wallow for a day and then I‚Äôll bounce back.

Upon seeing how distraught I‚Äôd become; she told me to take the day off and she‚Äôd contact occupational health for me and suggested maybe I contact my GP. I‚Äôm so scared I‚Äôm fucking everything up and that I‚Äôm not fit to work (even though I am more than capable on an intellectual level).

I‚Äôm scared of failing another probation

I‚Äôm scared of never finding a job that I actually feel capable of

I‚Äôm scared of being shamed for having a meltdown today

I‚Äôm scared of the drop in my MH recently

Most of all, I am so ashamed of being like this

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with me and I‚Äôm really concerned that I‚Äôm never doing to get better or be able to cope with working."

" I went to target with some pocket money in hopes that I could find something that I could afford. I had to the bathroom and mindlessly walked into a bathroom, knowing that that was always where the girl‚Äôs bathroom was. When I was done doing my business I walked out and saw a 6‚Äô5 man standing right in front of me. If I hadn‚Äôt just gone to the bathroom I probably would have pissed myself. I was super triggered because I have been sexually assaulted three times over the past three years and one happened very recently and I am not over the trauma at all yet. I‚Äôm scared of all men and boys that are bigger than me and it doesn‚Äôt feel like I will be getting over that any time soon.(I‚Äôm a 14F). I screamed on the top of my lungs and closed the stall door and locked myself in. A bunch of people came running in and asked me what was wrong and I told them that there is a man in the bathroom. There was a moment of silence and then everyone started screaming at me because apparently they had turned it into a unisex bathroom and I was being an asshole. I had no idea they had done this but I was still panicking and didn‚Äôt come out of the stall because I was shaking and sobbing. Once I came out everyone was saying that I‚Äôm a horrible person. I feel like it was a fair reaction because of my past, and I didn‚Äôt know it was unisex yet. It used to be a girls bathroom so I didn‚Äôt know what was going on. I live in a small town and there are a lot of people that are mad at me.
I tried to post this somewhere else but it got taken down because it violated the rules.
(Also it is not a typo, I am 14)

Edit: to the person who told me to go f*** myself: let me remind you that I‚Äôm a literal 13 year old twig who has to face a 6‚Äô5 man in the one place that I thought I would be safe in public, and my very little experience in life has been full of fear and distrust, but somehow you might need therapy more than I do."

I'm so sorry you had to go through this. You are not a horrible person - don't let them tell you that. It was probably a weird situation for the man who just wanted to use the bathroom, but if he and all the other people there were at least a little bit empathetic they would understand that you probably had a good reason for this reaction. I've been in a similar position many years ago and I just wanted to let you know that I understand your pain. These feelings, the anxiety, the need to protect yourself are all very valid reactions. And it might sound stupid, but I'm proud of you for not freezing, but screaming and raising hell. This is exactly what I teach my daughter to do when she feels threatened. Your reaction might've seemed unreasonable for the people around, but if they knew your story they might've understood it. Don't beat yourself up on it, this is not your fault.

No, you did absolutely nothing wrong... and im so sorry about your trauma and the violations you were subjected to. I would have been absolutely terrified if i was in your shoes and anyone who says otherwise is completely apathetic to your trauma. I know it's a very touchy subject in todays world, and you found yourself caught in the middle of an ideological battle that has little to do with you personally.

"The healthy level headed thing to do here would have been to calmly talk to you until you caught your breath and got over the worst startle, then gently explain it has become a unisex bathroom. An adult woman could've literally just... been gentle, told you you're safe, and offered to walk outside with you? Instead of yelling at you like that.

You're a child. It's not your job to tiptoe around adults who aren't grownup enough to regulate their own emotions, let alone judge those of a child. The only one in this situation other than you who has remotely any right to be hurt or upset, is the 6'5 man, who might (depending on what kind of person he is) be sad that he scared you so badly. Even then, not your responsibility! Sometimes people or places are just scary, and there's often not a lot to do about that.

Getting scared happens, and trauma responses are uncontrollable. It's okay. I'm sorry the adults in your community aren't better. You deserve to feel safe and understood."	Express_Presence_723	reply	na	na	na	0.9977825284004211	weak	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

As someone who is old enough to be your mother and who has had ptsd ongoing for many years... there is little you can do to control your response in the moment. You dont have full control of your rational mind. Your fear takes over and throws you into fight or flight mode. Dont ever feel ashamed for how you respond in those moments. Even if you had known it was unisex, you still shouldn't have been faulted for your trauma response.  Alerting the bystanders that it was a trauma response should have been enough details for them to asses the information and give you a little grace.

"I hope so, too. Small towns are awful like that! Yeah, just ignore them. Better not engage it, they'll just find more things to be mad about.

I think that if you wanted to let the guy know that you were genuinely just started, didn't know the bathroom had changed, get scared easily by such (you do not need to disclose truama at all), and that it wasn't at all *him* in particular, then that's perfectly okay - might even be a welcome gesture.

"I'm not sure if this is the right place for this but I'm really confused right now.

So I hooked up with an old fwb the other day and I feel I'm now in a spiral and questioning a lot of things.

First, it was just how I diverted any conversation where he was being nice to me (saying something positive about me, not even in a complimentary way, like he was stating his fact). I couldn't just sit with it, I had to change the topic or mention something else. Then he also said I was an expert at ""ruining the mood"" because anytime it got serious or too sexual, I would say something weird or say something that would make one or both of us laugh but in a way that did ruin the mood. He even said at one point how sad he felt when I told him I wasn't used to people saying nice things about/to me. Especially not in this context (friends, maybe. Not someone I have sex with) and especially because everything he said was actually about me as a person. Like I'm not used to people/guys seeing me as a person.

Then after doing the do, he was saying how he wants me to be more assertive because he felt like he was ""just doing it TO"" me. His exact words were: ""I feel like I'm doing it TO you."" 

Now, I'm in a spiral because I 100% saw what he meant throughout the night and it was true - I did divert and I did kind of just let him do it TO me rather than being more proactive or involved. Not, lie there and do nothing, but always only reacting to what he did. Just going along with things.

I don't think I was always like this but so many times I have been, or been in situations where I just didn't want it to happen, but for some reason couldn't say no. And my most recent ex always pestered for it that it felt like a chore. He would even keep on about trying an act I was clear I was uncomfortable with so it got to the point that I didn't want to do it because I didn't want to have to deal with him keeping on about that one act or trying to do it midway through.

This guy, the fwb, was honestly lovely and was very clear he wanted me to tell him what I wanted. But I just felt like I couldn't. Not exactly mute, but mostly. I went from feeling comfortable with him and equal, to feeling small and weak and powerless and it wasn't anything he did because he was always asking if it was okay. 

So now I'm just confused on where this behaviour came from, if I'm overreacting to it and if I'm just making a big deal out of a random comment. But he said it because I think he was worried or uncomfortable himself. I've always had a negative idea about my past relations with others and not feeling comfortable with stuff but this situation has made me realise just how often I did things I didn't want to and how much I hold everything in my past over me during dating anyone. I blame myself for not saying no when I wanted to and I feel like a bad person (for that and other things). But I can't let it all go and now I feel like I'm just this bad person who is unloveable. 

I don't know what I want from this so if you've read this far, thank you. I don't want to dump this all on my friends/family; they get enough from me already. But if I'm overreacting then I don't want to waste money looking for a therapist. Even then, what therapy would even work? I've tried CBT for other stuff and it doesn't work.

"Hi,

I need some help or advice. I grew up in an alcoholic home. 

That included me staying up all night long listening to my mom and step dad listening to loud music and eventually getting into an argument. 

I remember the feeling in my room. Panic. Fear. Hopelessness. Nothing I could do rather than listen and hope it goes away. Multiple nights a month. For years. 

I remember storming to the living room when step dad attacked my mom. I was armed with a baseball bat. A young kid defending my mom against a grown up drunk man. My mom shouting and crying. Anyways horrible memories.

Today I am a 40 year old man. All is good. Still however anytime my neighbour throws a party I get super anxious. I just feel awful. Even though the noise is not that bad. But I get all the symptoms back close to a point of panic. 

I am so embarrassed of my reaction. I‚Äôm a big muscular guy as well. Nothing to be afraid of. But still I can‚Äôt escape the feeling.

Any help please. Any words of wisdom. What is wrong with me.."	mrmojorisin17	post	14.220727563246813	male	White	0.9900858402252197	na	na	na	4	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"This is going to be a little long, so bear with me. This is a picture of me when I was around two or three years old. When I moved into my house, this picture dropped behind a cabinet and into the space between it and the wall. I I didn‚Äôt know this at the time, so was a bit of a shock when I went into this closet, and saw my face poking out from a hole that was in the wall! I digress.

I‚Äôve started doing some inner child work where you write a question as the adult with your dominant hand and then wait for a response and write that with your non-dominant hand. I haven‚Äôt been getting a response from my inner child so I thought maybe having a picture would help so I went to get this. 

Unfortunately, this picture was very wedged, and so I had to rip it into pieces to get it out. As I begin assembling the pieces and taping them back together, I looked at the rips and thought ‚Äú‚Äúwow this is a great representation of what that little boy and the adult in me went through.‚Äù 

These rips, symbolize, my soul, fractures, tears in my heart and in my mind. And each rip required its own specific and specialize piece of tape, since it ripped at odd angles. 

Looking at the completed picture, it‚Äôs clear that as many rips in my soul (trauma) that there has been, there has been many healing parts (pieces of tape). And some of these tears in the picture don‚Äôt line up perfectly which to me indicates that there is more mending (work) to be done.

It‚Äôs also very interesting as well that the age I am in this picture is around the age of my earliest traumatic memory. 

This precious boy had no idea how hard his life would become an eye mourn for him. For me. I‚Äôm so angry at my parents for their selfishness. I know that this resentment is like a poison and that they were doing all they could to survive as well, but I‚Äôm still hung up. 

I am 31 now and have struggled with multiple panic attacks a day for about six years now. I haven‚Äôt seen much progress, but given how powerful this experience was for me, I really think that trauma work is the path I need to be on right now. Thank you all for listening.

TLDR: I found a picture of me that reminded me of the trauma I‚Äôve been through."	xxblindsight	post	32.086496787855694	female	White	0.001739657367579639	na	na	na	6	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

Me (24f) and my mom's friends (40s f) and a (f13) child were out to vacation all weekend.  And we were at a candy store. The 13f ran off once we got to the register. Scared everyone absolutely shitless. Turns out she was just behind a tree. (We are in the north myrtle beach area) I was an absolute mess for about an hour trying to regulate myself but it was useless. Her mom gave her a money limit, she has a kinda bad home life. My mom and I think she's borderline. She has scars. I am still trying to process it all. How would you guys go about punishment for the 13f? She filled up almost an entire bag with candy and I barely got anything because all that sugar might upset my stomach with my gastro issues.

I wouldn't punish her, personally. She needs help. You guys writing off what she's going through at age 13 as a personality disorder is...kinda mean and also terrible for her recovery. But then again, wanting to punish a kid with a bad home life because your own stress response system went into overdrive, and being upset at age 24 that a literal child got sugary snacks you couldn't have also fits that MO so ü§∑ Kids aren't usually diagnosed with BPD btw, a lot of doctors won't even diagnose it in 18-25 year olds because so many people are just flat out more unstable while their brain develops and they adjust into adulthood.

"I wanted her to open up. I wasn't really writing her off like AT ALL. I love her like she's my own child.  I was scared out of my mind and like just panicked and shut down.  But her own mother let her loose in a sugary store. And then didn't keep an eye on her at all. I just really want what's best for her and she feels like she can't put herself first or talk to literally anyone or get the literal help she needs. She only sees the school counselor because her parents are so mean.
 EDIT: I really want to be a good part of her support system but if she doesn't think she needs help then I don't think I can do it. And this is supposed to be a yearly thing now. If she can't talk to her parents about what's going on in her life and ask them to get her therapy like I don't mean to be nasty she's just a kid but the parents should've really thought any things before hand and things.  Like communication is an issue for them as a whole.

"Sexual expectations make me freak out because of my trauma history. Like I can't do birthday sex or plan out sex. So I need enough time to trust someone to have sex and also enough hangouts to be able to feel like I'm really choosing to do it. I don't really know how to go to events to meet people so I've mostly met my sexual partners through apps.

I'm looking for advice from anyone who has dealt with this? Either how you worked on it or how you discuss it with possible sexual partners. My libido is high, I would genuinely be interested in having sex with whoever I meet up with, but I'd want them to like actually be ok if we end up just chilling. I'd mostly be worried about how to approach this with men (my initial traumatic relationship was with a man and it was the most severe of them) because there are unfortunately just more men who are interested in guaranteed hook ups and ones who will have expectations anyway even after promising it's fine.

Ik we're all different but any idea could be a good starting point. It may not be possible to make it work but I'd like to try. Really, really, really would like to try... üòÖ"	Cool-Egg-1089	post	23.03447965178348	female	White	0.003986448049545288	na	na	na	2	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

Yet shes in too deep into the darknesslike her true soul is 2hat she portrays which is the feirce deity  link but im terrified because i see the religious divinity its theoretically based off of because people are the worst monsters alive.. like imagine someone being nice to you and acting like feirce deity link with yet all youre seeing no matter how hard you try to see reality a form so scary and horrifying that its like being chased by an indestructible freddy kreuger with a ghost rider voice saying please dont run i want to help the world is scary people are scary but im not.

"I have been in serval relationships before and every relationship I have ever been in ended very roughly and seemingly out of nowhere. I have even asked outside perspectives on many relationships before and everyone I have ever spoken to has agreed they all ended abruptly (with some exemptions of abuse). 

My relationship prior to my current ended on excellent terms and he wanted to stay friends after: that was one of the things he asked before we even broke up. Even that ended up blowing up out of nowhere when I felt we were both fine (we had both moved on and didn't give each other any details about our new romantic lives besides that). Out of nowhere, he decided he couldn't handle being in my life anymore even though he admitted to me that I was very caring and we never actually saw each other in person after the initial breakup. I know that I can be emotionally intense, so I encourage those close to me regularly to let me know if it is too much so that I can self-soothe, regulate, and function in a way that doesn't break boundaries. 

The issue is that because almost no one has left my life on good terms, I am convinced my current, loving, patient, and wonderful boyfriend is going to end up hating me one day and leaving and I will once again be alone and confused. I have tried over and over again to prevent this issue from cycling through my brain. I journal my feelings so I don't blow up, I encourage those around me to set boundaries with me and do my best to not react negatively to them so that they don't feel guilty, and so many other emotional regulation tactics I have developed over the years. I can't get it out of my head he's going to leave. I genuinely would be fine if he left me with a reason. I worked hard to develop self-love outside of relationships so that my value didn't depend on the people I am with, but so many people leave without reason that it makes me incredibly anxious at the thought and I can't let it go. Any advice to get out of this mindset would be greatly appreciated.

&#x200B;

TLDR; I'm scared my boyfriend is going to leave me because of a pattern of people leaving me without any reason and emotionally tanking me in the process by using my vulnerabilities against me."	a-long-name	post	23.037189494756866	female	White	0.9973105192184448	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"Hello, I don‚Äôt really know where to start.. but I‚Äôm just looking for support, kindness, words of reassurance or advice on how to get through this. I recently went through something traumatic and I am currently not handling it well..

My best friend was out of town with her family, while her husband stayed home to watch the house and animals. They recently went to a rave and had some ecstasy left over. One night, he texted her and said he was going to take one. The next day she hadn‚Äôt heard back from him and got worried. She called me while I was at work and asked me to do a wellness check on him. 

I get to the house and ring the doorbell and the dogs are going nuts inside. My friend calls me and says she has a camera in the house and hadn‚Äôt seen any movement. She asked if she can give me the code so I can go inside and check. I typed in the code and the moment I open the door I see him. He is completely naked, lying face first in the floor. It looked like he had vomited blood. I ran up and started tapping him roughly and yelling his name. His body was cold to the touch. I started freaking out and called 911. I couldn‚Äôt really speak much at this point because I was in shock but I describe the situation and she asked if I can move him onto his back. I try with all my night and he‚Äôs too heavy. She asked if I can get help and I was alone so I went next door. A neighbor came in and I was frantic at this point trying to move him, but he told me to stop while he went outside and talked to the dispatcher. I knew he was dead.. but I just didn‚Äôt want to accept it. He was there for atleast 12 hours.. full rigor mortis. And body decomposition, or lividity I think they said it was called, was in full effect. I cried yelling his name and I gave him a rub on the back of his head, gentle and soft, so I can say goodbye and give him some affection on his way out from this world.

I had to stay over 4 hours to wait for fire truck team to come pronounce him dead, had to muster up the strength to call my best friend and tell her she lost her husband, while asking information to give to them for the coroner. Had to walk over his body to put the dogs up so they weren‚Äôt in the way. Coroners took hours. And they don‚Äôt tell you this, but there is no clean up crew. I‚Äôm blessed my bf came to provide moral support and offered to clean the blood for me. We picked up the house so my best friend didn‚Äôt have to come home to imagine his final moments.

How do I cope? I‚Äôm going through so much emotions. I‚Äôm disassociating. My heart breaks for my best friend. But I‚Äôm glad it was me and not her who found him. I feel weak. Powerless. Confused. Angry. Please help. Even if it‚Äôs just kind words.."	IndependenceMinute	post	22.27842321774273	female	White	0.9948910474777222	na	na	na	8	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"Rest in Paradise to your friend's husband! </3

I want you to know that you did everything 100% right and while facing an extremely tragic situation you were able to call for help. you are a very resilient individual and selflessly decided to shield your friend from any additonal pain.

afters years of experience as a first responder at festivals, demonstrations and night clubs I understand how devastating drug related emergencies and deaths are. the stigma around recreational use of any substances is still prominent and most people have no idea how traumatic being the ""first at the site"" can be.

your feelings right now are all valid. your brain and body are working overtime to process the memories. finding a person you knew well in such a condition is more than heartbreaking!

you might need someone trustworthy to express all the thoughts and feelings. your friend will be most likely very busy with their own grief and official processies. 

I highly recommend seeking professional help for yourself (online therapy, support groups, local therapist). 

if you feel absolutely overwhelmed by racing thoughts, memories or nightmares you can always write them down. it doesn't have to be a personal journal, in pretty handwriting or grammatically correct! sometimes blank printer paper and a pen is all you need. write down all the things that you did or wish you did and all the things you can't share with anybody at this moment. you can also write a letter to loved one, the husband, your friend or even yourself - these letters don't have to handed over or can be later in life.

in case of self-harming or suicidal thoughts, please call your national suicide hotline or seek out your nearest emergency room.

If you have any other friends who aren't the wife to talk to, I really really recommend calling them up and seeing them in person if you can.

Sometimes writing thoughts down can feel daunting but I found that taking part in my hobbies helps me feel like myself again while also allowing me to process things. 

If you're feeling avoidant, maybe try setting an alarm for 5 minutes and then allowing yourself to feel all of the feelings until the timer goes off. Start small and add more time if you need to.

"I have GAD, OCD, and was diagnosed with PTSD about 13 years ago (recently told it is likely CPTSD due to the extended length of the trauma). I've been through SA, physical and emotional abuse, and a ton of abandonment. One of the only boundaries I have in relationships is that I cannot tolerate porn. Outside of my trauma, the way it makes me feel when my partner looks at it is detrimental to my self image and it just isn't something I can live with. I understand this is a ""taboo"" thing to not be okay with, but it is a compassionate act to myself to lay this boundary out.

The issue is, I am clear with this boundary. I am crystal clear. I say that I will not stay if it becomes a part of our relationship. And then I stay. I get lied to, I find out, and I stay. My current SO told me in the beginning that he never looked at porn anymore, because he himself had major trauma surrounding it from an abusive relationship in the past. I found out in December that he was lying to me and had been looking at it regularly since we had started seeing each other, often daily and for hours at a time, even if we were intimate the same day. He saw the worst of it and watched how it broke me down. I hardly ate or slept for weeks. He swore he'd never do it again, he'd never make me feel that way again, and that he ""knew it would hurt me, but didn't know it'd hurt me that bad"". We created our own videos to fulfill the need for visual stimulus. He recently started on Wellbutrin, so he said his sex drive has been pretty much gone.

Today, I found out that he found a ""loophole"" and has been watching provocative videos of women on social media apps to utilize them as porn. I am feeling gutted, again. The day he chose to save these videos for the purpose of self gratification was \*my birthday\*. He says it was a one time thing, and he wasn't able to use the videos to completion due to guilt. I know I should hold my boundary, but I can't. I struggle with it. My therapist says that the more I tolerate, the more I'll be pushed - but I don't want to lose him. At the same time, he doesn't respect me or my feelings enough to respect my \*one\* boundary. I'm at the point where I feel like I want to be alone forever to avoid ever even trying to trust someone again. I've been gracious and understanding and compassionate and willing to work with him through everything (he's been verbally/emotionally abusive on a number of occasions due to emotional dysregulation), and I feel like I'm just getting screwed over continuously. I've told him that I just need him to be honest with me - and he can't even do that. He hides behind the excuse of guilt or shame - but why were the guilt or shame not enough to stop him in the first place?

I'm tired. I want to matter enough to be respected."	Public_Intention_955	post	26.483650815940074	female	White	0.9979829788208008	na	na	na	10	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

I think that if he wants to watch pornography that's fine and if you don't want him to watch it that's fine. The issue is that this means you are incompatible. It's not OK to try to force him to be someone he isn't or make him feel guilty about enjoying porn and it's not okay for him to lie about what he likes and wants. I know you don't want to hear this but I don't think it's about right or wrong, I think it's about being incompatible and I think both of you would be happier if you let each other go and found someone more in line with your wants and needs.

If he is addicted to porn, he shouldn‚Äôt have entered a relationship with you knowing this wasn‚Äôt acceptable. Using his guilt to escape accountability is bullshit. The excuse he used was bullshit.

Certainly I agree - which is why I was 100% entirely upfront and transparent before we even got involved that it was not something I would be okay with having in my relationship.

I do wish that he would have 1. not gotten involved with me if he knew he was going to continue partaking in it and/or 2. communicated with me that it was a problem if he realized he couldn't stop. I am gracious, I am supportive, and I would be happy to be there for him if it was a problem he wanted to let go of. But it doesn't seem like he does. This is the first thing I have found in the 6 months since the huge discovery, but it undermines any of the trust I have been working my ass off to have. It makes me wonder how much I don't know.

"I understand you. It‚Äôs so strong and so so so painful. You are allowed to have these boundaries. I don‚Äôt see this as you making him feel guilty for watching porn, you‚Äôre just trying to make him acknowledge that he has betrayed your trust more than once over a boundary he knew was set from the beginning, and actually do something to fix it instead of lying again. *I have actually made people feel guilty for these things, whether intentionally or not and it brings a lot of shame because I know it isn‚Äôt okay, so I‚Äôm not trying defend those behaviors.* I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre feeling this awful pain again. 


It looks really selfish. I wish he would just be honest with you that he does not wish to stop so you could move on. Please choose yourself. You do not deserve to keep feeling this pain over and over again. It is soul crushing. You matter. You deserve respect. 

Unless this is all due to trauma of his, no, it doesn‚Äôt seem he is actually remorseful and instead uses his own guilt to make you feel guilty. If he can‚Äôt respect it, he shouldn‚Äôt be in a relationship with you, although I know that‚Äôs easier said than done. If it‚Äôs due to trauma, he could be open with you since you are clearly more than willing to work with him. He isn‚Äôt the one feeling that pain whenever he breaks your trust. If you do stay- now that you have have major trust issues due to his actions, will he do any work to help you repair that trust or just leave you alone to deal with it? 


I‚Äôm also concerned about your own trauma. Can you heal while being in a relationship with someone that is actively hurting you? It doesn‚Äôt seem likely for this to improve at all while he is doing things that have traumatized you in the past.  You must be in safety. I know you don‚Äôt want to lose him, it feels devastating but after the initial anxiety you would feel relieved to no longer deal with this issue + the verbal/emotional abuse. This could be the wrong approach to take, I am sorry if it‚Äôs offensive or pushy in any way, I‚Äôm just concerned and I would need to hear this if it were me."

"Cheating talk: I‚Äôll keep what happened simple;

My partner wants to travel potentially and asked how I felt about him going to a different country alone for a month or so. I said it would be really awesome for him to do that, see things, etc. The first thought in my mind though was ‚ÄúI feel so nervous about that because I jump to the idea that I will be cheated on‚Äù. I waited a little before I told him that I also felt this way, and I did say my genuine feeling. I did express that I would feel that way about any partner I may have, that it‚Äôs not just a him thing. He expressed how he wouldn‚Äôt do those things and listed several logical reasons why. None of the reasons were because of our relationship, they were just situational or unsafe reasons idk. I started thinking more and asked him ‚Äúwould you also just not do that stuff because you‚Äôre in a relationship?‚Äù ‚Ä¶ and he kinda sighed and asked if we could not talk about this anymore, because he felt sad, and that he felt bad about the traveling thing now. I got the sense that he was triggered maybe? And then I felt weird because now the convo was over immediately, and I feel like I‚Äôm not sure what I did. Not talking now. Sigh. I do have a lot of cheating and sexual trauma in general, so this idea and fear that he‚Äôs thinking of sex outside of me is present most days. Especially when travel is involved.

"I worked with this girl for about 5 months ( I wasn't there for long). Shortly after I left I found out that she and her baby girl had been taken out by the baby daddy. Coward took himself out too. 

My job was at a very small office, everyone worked in very close proximity so it didn't take much time for you to get close to others. I wouldn't say I was particularly close to her, but we did text here and there and from the beginning I felt myself very drawn to her. She reminded me of one of my own friends, whom I love very much, so this created in me a soft spot for her. 

Before the tragedy and before I left, there had been small incidents that should have been red flags to me and to others that something was very wrong at home. She had severe mood swings, sometimes she'd come in with puffy eyes and not say a thing to anyone. People that had known her for a while (there at work)  would say that she was like that, that she was insecure and would get offended easily, to watch what I said around her. I never experienced anything like that with her, and as a matter of fact the reason we started texting was because I'd check in on her. I had a hunch she was probably just going through life, like so many of us. The day I left I gave her a hug and I told her to keep in touch, she said she would. 

Three weeks later I found out, their bodies where found two days later after being deceased from üî´ wounds. Despite my acquaintanceship with her being mainly work related, I've still had such a difficult time not thinking about her. Replaying the red flags, my mind cynically creating what she went through in my head. Prior to this happening I was already dealing with my own issues with anxiety and mild depression. I can't afford therapy so I had been coping with my issues on my own, but when that happened it just unleashed an insufferable amount of invasive thoughts. It's getting to the point where I'm starting to feel angry at myself for not letting it go, after all we weren't close, I was literally no one to her. 

I guess I seek any coping strategies or ways to rid yourself of thinking of something that as truly horrible as it is, it is in the past, I cannot change it."	alvaraboom	post	28.370333720899538	male	White	0.9928699135780334	na	na	na	4	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"It‚Äôs normal for the brain to remain unsettled with shocking events.

When things happen so fast, the brain doesn‚Äôt know what to do with the information.. 

‚ÄúWhat happened? Why? Why is the world this way? Am I vulnerable or in danger?‚Äù

Then this happened‚Ä¶
Then this happened‚Ä¶
Then I went to the _ and did _‚Ä¶

"Whether you knew her well or not you obviously cared for her - she reminded you of someone else you cared for, and it sounds like you bonded reasonably well despite low contact. 5 months can be substantial. 

Plus, the shocking type of event would be painful for anyone to reconcile. You can see signs in hindsight, but no one could have actually predicted what was going to happen, even her. You still did more than normal in giving her support through a tough time for her. 

Even if she didn't reach out to you after you left, you know she was going through a lot and I'm sure she was grateful for you checking in with her and being maybe one of very few kind faces for her. 

Take time for yourself, allow yourself to accept that you did feel somewhat close to her and it was most likely reciprocal. And accept that this was a horrible tragedy, it's not okay that these kinds of things happen so it's the *rational* thing to be viscerally disgusted that it could happen, that baby daddy could *do* that, and to try to think of how it could have been avoided. It'll take time to move past this. 

Best advice for moving on faster is to lean on friends (if you have them) for support, distract yourself with hobbies and other things so it's not in your mind all the time, and also take some time to deliberately reflect on your memories with her (on your own and maybe with your old coworkers or other people who knew her), or post more here or something.

Looking for advice and tips:

As the title suggests, my partner is under abuse from their father.

They are currently trying to move out ASAP, but it might take a month or two before that can happen any time soon.

They are moving with their sister, who wanted to get a job prior to moving (has an interview tmr). And their mother is also being annoying regarding them moving, she doesn't want them to move without all the proper furniture. I conviced both my partner and their sister to try to push mother to let them move asap.

They don't know what's happening. I've talked to my partner about it, but we don't see eye to eye regarding telling them.

I'm doing my best to be there for them, keep them company and take care of them. Other than that, I don't know what to do. I, myself have been a victim, but everyone experiences it differently.

"I mean, it seems like OP specified it because it's the kind of harassment that a parent would do to someone who registers to them/sees them as female and whose gender the parent is ignoring because they're a shitty parent.

I guess my feedback for you is: sure, this is non-zero-usefulness information, but it feels like a distraction and does come off as unnecessarily nitpicky

I personally try to take this kind of information and just assume the OP was trying to communicate something useful with it, even if I don't clearly understand why they would specify, unless they're obviously doing it in a way that's bad for some reason I understand. 

In this case, knowing that someone is AFAB, and young, communicates that they likely have not had much time outside of the typical societal pressures that are placed on people perceived as women, like punishing/shaming their ability to say ""no"" and so on. These are assumptions I'm making, but they're ones that are at least made somewhat more likely than not by seeing that this was specified."

"So recently I discovered I may have schizophrenia. I have nightmares of horrible things, and felt like getting some facts from my brother would help. It would give me an opportunity to apologize for my behavior if in fact I did do something worth apologizing for.
I don't talk to my family, due to systemic rape from my childhood that all but him were involved in. I ask him if I ever flipped to a darker side and threatened him or his wife, he said no, but proceeded to infer that I needed to apologize to the family for things I've done. He ""doesn't want to get into detail"", but pushes the fact that I need to apologize for something. I ask, ""are you talking about the rape accusation I publicly outed them for? Because I attempted to do that in private, and they basically told me to shut up. So I publicly outed them.""
He switches the subject focusing on a time I insulted his wife's intelligence. He requires me to apologize for offending her and also in turn him due to it occuring before the public rape accusation. 
This asshat is pissed because I offended his wife before the fact, and I refuse to apologize to people now siding with rapists. AITA for telling him he's dead to me until he can acknowledge the seriousness of the rape accusations? That his feelings on offending his wife's intelligence means nothing when he's siding with rapists?

"I always had a fear of losing reputation. Fear of losing everything I have, every dear person I love. 
In the past, there were few situations that made me feel extremely ashamed of. Whenever it happened, I isolate myself from everyone literally and let it pass. But sometimes, those situations come to my mind suddenly.

Few days ago, I had a prom night. I got extremely drunk that I don't remember all the things that happened. Only a few details. I know I was so irritating, desoriented and inappropriate then to all of the people I met there being drunk. I feel so ashamed of behaving that way, especially because one of them was a person that was really dear to me (and I secretly love her).


The next day, my ex roommate, during a conversation in our dm, was reminding me literally everything I did that night. I told him to stop because I suddenly felt sick, but he didn't stop. After reading all of that, I got to the toilet and threw up. I was aching for 2 hours, I couldn't relax a little bit. 


Whenever I look at my prom suit, a bottle of glass, an alcoholic drink, or any small thing related... it instantly reminds me of that event. I feel very frightened for my future because I can't cope with my life with knowing I behaved so idiotic.

"(Trigger warning)

I was sexually assaulted at a summer camp; it was the year leading up to fourth grade and he told me to come to the bathroom with him. I followed because I thought I could trust him, but obviously I couldn't. He was carrying a knife in his pocket and the moment he locked us in a stall he pulled it out.

Ever since that happened, I have been terrified of older kids or kids that are bigger than me. I'm getting bullied by kids that are in the grade above me because I'm not as good as masking fear as I thought I was. I'm also scared of my male teachers, but I don't think they picked up on it this year. I'm terrified to tell anyone about this because there are so many kids doing it, that they would not all get in trouble at once, so if I did tell anyone I would be the target for a beating. Usually fights take place in the bathroom, but I don't go in there because I'm scared a trans girl might be in there. (Our school supports that so a lot of trans girls and boys go in) There is basically no point in having girl or boy bathrooms at our school because if someone calls out a boy that is not trans for walking into the girls' bathroom they will get sent to the principal's office. I don't want to make anyone mad but that is just how it is. I support LGBTQ but I don't support boys walking into a non-unisex bathroom. (For some clarification when I say ""boys"" I mean straight boys) Obviously, I have to go in there sometimes because *lady problems.*

I have never told anyone about this, and I'm scared that my therapist might tell my mom, which is the last think I want. The person who assaulted me died recently and I feel like a little bit was lifted off my shoulders, and I'm honestly happy about it.  Sometimes I wish it had been more slow and painful, just like what he did to me. I used to be able to hear his voice behind me everywhere I went, he was telling me that he was going to murder me/ kidnap me. I knew it was just in my head, but now when I hear him, I just smile knowing that it's not really him. The only thing that truly scares me is when I see his watching me through a window/in the distance. I know that he isn't really there, but it feels like it. How can I see him if he isn't there?

I don't know how to tell her, or how to make sure she doesn't tell my mom. I can't pay for therapy because I'm in middle school (Yes, middle school, sue me) and I don't really have much control over what happens with these kinds of things. My last resort is going to an all-girls self-defense class and lifting weights over them summer. If these kids can't leave me alone, I'll make them. All I want is an education and they are making have to hide during the school day and I'm getting tired of it. I'll probably chicken out at the last second because like I said, I'm scared of them but it's worth trying if it's the only way they will get the message. These kids are a lot bigger than me so it's going to be hard work, but I'll get there.

I really need some advice on this because I don't have very good communicating skills and every time I try to tell someone something I say it in a way that makes it sound like I'm talking about something else. (And I'm so shy that group a kids thought I was mute for a while)"	Express_Presence_723	post	21.381755124605387	female	White	0.011330295354127884	na	na	na	2	traumatoolbox	'no prediction.'

First of all, I‚Äôd like to commend you on being so strong and courageous for putting this out there and explaining what happened. No one deserves to suffer in the way that you have, and you have every right to feel the fear and the sadness and the pain. I‚Äôm an adult, 27, but I was once a child who went through some awful and traumatic events. It‚Äôs instincts for kids to be afraid to tell their parents something like this, or anything for that matter. Being scared of being ashamed or your parents disappointed in you, atleast that‚Äôs what I feared for a long time. But my mother ended up being my greatest ally when I suffered. She never judged me for what happened, just gave me the love and support I desperately needed to move on from what happened. I think you posting this and putting things into words is a great first step. Maybe write a letter to your Mom about what happened. Wrote out whatever you feel comfortable of her knowing. Maybe reading it can help give you the courage needed to speak and express yourself. Maybe you can write a letter to your abuser. Calling them out for their actions, the negative repercussions from their actions, and how much you resent them for it. Just keep working on finding ways to let it out and speak about this. You cannot and should not have to deal with these complex emotions alone. You are a brave person, and I‚Äôm proud of you. You got this. Don‚Äôt be afraid to take a risk and trust someone.

"I moved away from my abusive parent when I was 13, due to her being placed in a psych ward. Unfortunately, my nan who I moved in with was an aggressive alcoholic, enabled by my uncle (who she considers an angel) who ran her life, gaslighted me into believing I was lucky to live there and kicked me out of that house multiple times a year when the drinking got too bad (this continued for 5 years), sending me to my grandad with narcissistic tendencies who was the reason why my nan was ‚Äúfucked up‚Äù in the first place. 

He always got bored of me and sent me back to my nan until after quarantine where I ended up with my parent again (she had been out of the ward for a few years). 

Although I have sometimes enjoyed living with her again and she claims she‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter now‚Äù, between her getting very drunk and asking me to unalive her as well as general infantilisation I can‚Äôt convince myself that I‚Äôm safe here anymore, especially considering we‚Äôre living in her friend‚Äôs house due to financial reasons which is not sustainable. 

She‚Äôs tried to convince me that I can‚Äôt function on my own and that I need to forget her past abuse but I‚Äôve tried to remain strong and at age 20 have booked myself into student accommodation for the year and so far intend to do so again until I leave university.

However, my biggest fear is what I‚Äôll do after that‚Äôs over. I aim to get a job but I am unsure what to do if the money is not enough to rent somewhere to live. 

While I know to an extent that her claims that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to function alone aren‚Äôt completely true, due to being told that I‚Äôm garbage my entire life, I struggle to make decisions and trust myself (and other people). I‚Äôm afraid that there‚Äôs a lot of things that are supposed to be automatic as an adult that I just don‚Äôt know.

Any advice on functioning in a new home/dorm, functioning as an adult and what to do after you leave student accommodation will be extremely appreciated."	Dreamstrider456	post	21.747637028019383	female	White	0.9958090782165527	na	na	na	3	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

People of this community, I need some advice. I, now a 17yr old male have been living by myself for the past couple of weeks since social services moved me out. The reasons I moved out were due to me and my dad having a fight over what he let me eat. He would only let me eat pasta, so for the last 2 months of me living with him that‚Äôs all I would eat and eventually I got pissed off and fed up, especially since he claims to care about my health. The fight culminated in him strangling me and bending several fingers in my hand back too far, and since I play piano that is a major problem for me as they still haven‚Äôt fully healed (fyi I wish to study music at uni). I ran to a friends house and they called social services who have since moved me out. I have been struggling with depression and suicide and I am unsure how to continue, because part of me wishes to report my dad the other part of me still loves him in some way. What should I do?

"Trigger warning SA of a child by multiple people.

If you want to read the particulars look in my post history and there are some posts on this topic of various memories, traumas and flashbacks I have been enduring all throughout this year. But long story short my mum and I were having a conversation in December and she said something, I don't remember exactly what now, it may be in my posts I will have to look back to see if I can pin point it. But she unlocked a Pandora's box of trauma and memories that I wish had been locked away forever. 

I suddenly zoned out as my mind flooded with flashbacks and memories as they all fought for attention after having been locked away for so long and I came to the realisation that I had been sexually abused consistently by a local girl and her parents from approximately the age of 3-11 years old. And today is the police interview. 

I had a phone call appointment with RASA who are a survivor charity, and she told me what to expect, but I still feel totally unprepared for this. How do you even prepare for this? I have been warned that the police officer may act cold towards me as they don't want it to seem like I'm being coached and it's just protocol but I'm scared that will make me clam up. What if I forget things? What if I'm rambling so much I somehow contradict myself because of all the information trying to flood out at once. What if I have a panic attack? I don't tend to cry, what if they take my lack of tears as me being unaffected? What if there are other victims? What if there aren't and I'm not protecting anyone and just hurting my own psyche? I know of one boy who was abused along with me, but it's whether he remembers and if he does whether he's willing to come forward, or if his memories are locked away like mine were. So many whats and how's and why's that noone can answer.

I'm terrified I'm opening up a can of worms by reporting this and we will never get the lid back on. I'm worried about my family's safety as the people who did this still live next to my mum and sister. They aren't exactly known for their kind nature. My family don't support me in going through with this so I feel like I'm just causing them trouble.

I feel like I need to do this because the girl tried to teach me how to abuse her younger siblings when we were playing games with them. I refused to touch them but it didn't stop her. 

It's 20+ years ago, will there be witnesses? Will there be anything that makes this stick? I don't know I'm just sat on my bedroom floor trying not to have a panic attack. Trying to prepare myself to let the flood gates open. I need to go to the shop and get a note book so I can make a list of specific instances I remember clearly so I don't forget to mention them. My freind has offered to take me for a drive later on to try and settle my mind afterwards so I don't do something stupid because of all the trauma I've been trying to bury coming to the forefront.

If anyone has advice my interview is in just under 2 hours. Please help if you can."	xxasynixxx	post	26.094392065017836	female	White	0.988129198551178	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

This can help. But if she has fingernails‚Ä¶ what about a key to her house or car? So if she has nails she‚Äôd have to get rid of them because it‚Äôs possible that if you take away *everything* sharp ( not possible unless you cut off her fingernails permanently) she will just go to the next thing she has availabile- her own hands. And I mention the house/car key because that is another item you can‚Äôt just hide or get rid of it. And I say *all of this* because of experience. When I got rid of all the sharp things I preferred- scissors, thumbtacks- or simply didn‚Äôt have access, I went to what I did have. And I almost always had a key and I always have fingernails. I typically bite them so they‚Äôre usually fine. But when I‚Äôm not? They‚Äôre as good as razor blades.

"Recently started seeing an amazing girl but every time we do the deed we cant seem to go for more than a few minutes without her throwing up or needing to stop because she is a about to throw up. This also happens with me just giving her oral. Typically this seems to happen when she starts getting close to cumming. 

Looking online there seems to be different medical issues that could cause this but the mostly likely thing to me seems to be anxiety/trauma.

"I think one thing to do is to make sure she is willing and feels empowered enough to tell you no to sex or to stop sex (before she feels like she is going to throw up) if she starts to feel anxious or anything other than feeling positively towards sex. Idk if she‚Äôs choosing to have sex out of feeling obligated or pressured (you don‚Äôt have to obligate or pressure her for her to feel that way if she has trauma), but she needs to stop and you need to make sure she feels a safe space to stop. 

Next thing is to make sure you never make her feel like this has to do with you. Of course it affects the relationship and your sex life, but focusing on those things right now or with her ever will come off super selfish and insensitive and hurtful. If she has trauma, she‚Äôs the real one suffering.

"I am unsure where to post this.
My best friend lives with my family. She has cerebral palsy so she can‚Äôt transport herself and is in ongoing discomfort due to her condition. She has a history of neglect in her family, which is one reason my family has opened up to let her stay with them. She has a therapist, but I am the majority of her peer support. Long story short, I‚Äôm really beginning to hit burnout. Her ups and downs are exhausting, and so are mine. When I am doing well, she suddenly isn‚Äôt. When she is doing well, I am not. After a good day, she will usually have something happen with sleep or mood that gives her a bad day. I‚Äôm constantly trying to support her, prompt her to eat at times, and for the most part, help take care of her basic needs due to her cerebral palsy. I do not want her to check in to a hospital on her worst days, and I don‚Äôt want to send her anywhere. I am just really fucking burnt out and am now needing community support, but don‚Äôt know where to go yet. Maybe I should call mental health centers and see if they have support programs for people who provide support? My friend is getting more and more support, waiting on SSI status updates, etc so we are checking off those boxes, right? This isn‚Äôt a situation where I am just trying to help her alone.

"My trauma history is extensive. I won‚Äôt go into details about any of the events but I experienced sexual abuse from an adult family member from a very young age until puberty, was cornered and verbally sexually harassed often by boys in middle school, had many explicit online relationships with adults in chatrooms when I was 11, was assaulted on several occasions while intoxicated (sometimes without my consent) while partying through my early 20, and was hospitalized twice due to abuse inflicted by a domestic partner, who‚Äôs intention was to murder me.
I have been though treatment (EMDR as well as CBT/DBT) and do consider myself to be a moderately stable, functioning, recovered adult.  I work full time and have sustained healthy relationships with friends and my life partner, as well as being currently in the process of receiving my degree in clinical psychology, so I can help other survivors.  I‚Äôm usually social, but about once a week, I isolate myself from everyone and watch dramatized crime shows for the majority of the day (usually criminal minds but I‚Äôve also recently watched Dahmer). I must be clear: I in NO WAY fetishize or romanticize these crimes, yet watching this for hours on end gives me a sense of peace, rather than triggering me, and I‚Äôm wondering if this is common among other survivors of similar trauma? Only one of my perpetrators every faced legal consequences, and I‚Äôve noticed myself sort of obsessing over these shows since his release a few months ago. My suspicion is that seeing these ‚Äúunsubs‚Äù brought to justice is what calms me down, but again I‚Äôd like to hear from other survivors think?"

"I feel stuck, about 6 years ago I found out my (now ex-wife) was physically abusing my son and cheating on me. We split up and now it's just me and my son.

"Last year I left a religious community where I‚Äôd lived for seven years. Sustained a lot of bullying, gaslighting and manipulation during that time and ended up developing anorexia.

Since then I‚Äôve had minimal contact with the people I lived with and have tried to move on with life as best I can. Would say I‚Äôve done fairly well. I still go to church, which has been hard, as in the back of my mind I‚Äôve often been anxious about seeing one of these people at my church - something I thought was almost completely unlikely.

Well, yesterday I was at church with my parents and my partner, and as we left who should walk in but someone from the community. Not someone who had been directly a cause of bullying, but a person who has a very challenging personality - a massive ‚Äúholier than thou‚Äù mentality. 

They saw me and we started chatting, and then I introduced my partner. What happened horrified me - my partner is a wheelchair user, and this person started saying things like ‚ÄúBless you! Ohhh blesss‚Äù. No questions about him or interest in him as a person. Hugged him without asking. I honestly could have fainted right then and there, I was so uncomfortable. 

All I could do when we got out of the church was apologise to him. Because while I felt incredibly uncomfortable about seeing someone from my past, the worse issue was how they treated him. 

When I chatted to my parents about it they were quite insensitive and my dad made a comment like ‚Äúlet‚Äôs talk about something more important‚Äù. That really hurt.

My partner was so so good about it but honestly, this was much much MUCH worse than I could ever have anticipated."	Importer-Exporter1	post	14.08981410291771	male	White	0.9980046153068542	na	na	na	2	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

I don‚Äôt know if this helps but a little about me I really don‚Äôt like many people and making friends is really hard for me. So I‚Äôm not a huge party type especially since I have a boyfriend I don‚Äôt feel comfortable being around other guys. My roommate does and asked if I wanted to hang out with a bunch of guys and her I declined and said I was sick and walked back to my dorm at 9 by myself. Which was fine with me, I get there and wake up at 2 AM and she is still not there. I text to ask if she‚Äôs okay and she‚Äôs like yeah with a few friends. She comes back in at around three (she didn‚Äôt know I was awake) stayed for a bit then left again. She came back at 5 and this time with a guy. I just thought maybe he‚Äôs going to stay over because I highly doubt she‚Äôd have sex with a guy in the same room as me, so I just acted asleep still. Then the noises hit and you know how that goes. I feel disrespected especially since she just met me that same day. I‚Äôm not against sex but I just felt as if she could have waited till I left that morning so I wasn‚Äôt in the same room. Every time I think about it I start crying and get to the point it‚Äôs hard to breathe. I told my mom and a student working member and asked if I should just explain my situation to the housing board to see if I should get a different roommate or talk to her about it. I don‚Äôt really know what to do and I‚Äôm about to go to my boyfriends and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll end up crying about it when I get there. My mom called as I was driving to ask about it and I couldn‚Äôt speak without wanting to cry. I could barely look at her that morning. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

"You should request another roommate. It is not just disrespect, there are several issues there.

1) Disrespect to your boundaries. This is how all the future issues will be handled. She will not take your need into consideration, she will do whatever she wants. 

2) You don't want to be involved in someone's else sex kinks. Having sex in the same room with you (a total strai) seems like it. It is extremely uncomfortable to you.

3) Safety issue. The biggest one. You didn't sign up to sleep in the room with unknown drunk guy(s). You have no idea who he is and what he is capable of. It looks like she doesn't really know it as well and she just brought in a random ONS (because if she would plan to bring her boyfriend in advance, she would tell you, or introduce you before). And there could be a lot of such guys. It is plain unsafe for you to live there. You deserve to feel safe in your own place. Emphasize this issue when talking about another roommate."

"To start I‚Äôm nonbinary transmasc and severally asexual. Relevant I promise 

I‚Äôm a very traumatized person and I‚Äôm trying to heal and work through what I can. And I have this friend who‚Äôs been in my life a little over a year now, and the friendship we have has been the most stable and healing thing I‚Äôve ever experienced. I‚Äôm having my needs met, I don‚Äôt feel bad for being too honest or needy, I don‚Äôt feel like I have to hold back at all, it‚Äôs okay for me to have trauma responses, they‚Äôre the only person I can touch without having being overloaded sensory wise, they show me I‚Äôm loveable and have helped me accept and embrace pieces of myself that I‚Äôve buried. 

I‚Äôve been able to undo some layers of unhealthy attachment styles and trauma because of this friendship. And though my friend isn‚Äôt as emotionally vulnerable as I try to be, I‚Äôve seen them change for the better since knowing them, and hope that I‚Äôve been able to give them the same love. 

In addition to all of this I‚Äôve for sure had romantic feelings for this person. I am asexual so it‚Äôs really just an emotional thing, like extra hard friendship feelings. But we mesh really well together and have similar plans for the future, so if we were to ever date I think it would go super well and we‚Äôd be able to grow more together. And honestly they‚Äôre the only person I‚Äôve met and could legitimately see as being a lifelong partner. 


However, here is where my issue starts. They‚Äôve started the process of medically feminizing themselves, and I‚Äôm so happy for them, I‚Äôm so damn excited for them to have all the gender euphoria! 
But because of my trauma, I‚Äôm terrified of women. 90% of my trauma was given to me by women. I can‚Äôt make or sustain friendships with women, I genuinely do not trust them unless I feel like I‚Äôm in a situation where I have to. I‚Äôve never been able to figure out how to work on that, and I‚Äôve always related more to guys anyways so it‚Äôs not something Ive really tried to work on either. 

I don‚Äôt know how feminine my friend is wanting to be. And I‚Äôm deeply terrified that I might accidentally hurt them because of what so many others have done to me. 

Yet at the same time, since knowing this, I‚Äôve had this odd need to protect them? Like similar to how a dad protects his daughters or a man protects his wife kinda feeling. Which is weird for me. And despite my deep fear of women, my romantic feelings for this person are still very strong, if not stronger? I guess it might be that I feel like I could be the strong one, and provide and protect in some way, and they can be my safe space emotionally? And this makes me feel more masculine and is therefore gender affirming for me? But at the same time I very much am not romantically attracted to women, despite asking myself if I was most of today.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do with all of these feelings. And they all feel like they‚Äôre pulling in opposite directions. I really want to bring these things to my friend, but it just seems like so much, and I don‚Äôt want to overload them or accidentally hurt them. Any advice would be appreciated"	Competitive_Monk2954	post	23.789658121827657	female	White	0.003849402070045471	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

I am a medical student in my final year, i had a pretty insufferable childhood because of my father's addiction of alcohol and other drugs. In 2022 , it almost costed me my med school when i had to forcefully intervene to get my father treated for what seemed to be a mandibular necrosis but later on was diagnosed as oral cancer after  mandible was removed for an implant gladly it got treated but still he's at risk.. Even after so much happening to him, he still believes that he is invincible and emotionally abuses me whenever i stop him from consuming alcohol. So ,my question to you all is , will it be selfish if i move out to pursue my higher education overseas?? I want to do it for the peace of my mind and for a better development in my career as a doctor. The reason why i stayed was to keep him away from torturing my mother. She has endured a lot and i am feeling like i am being selfish of thinking to move out for my post graduates.

OP, in all honesty you are in much more danger of being forced into some type of compromised situation the longer you  remain in this situation! Think about it. You are a mandated reporter, living with a person who unhesitatingly goes against his doctors orders and by doing so he is repeatedly putting his life in jeopardy. What is your responsibility, given that you are a medical professional, in this situation? You are also living in a family that is highly dysfunctional, where you are aware that there is domestic abuse being committed. The person being victimized is unwilling to report her abuse, as are you, and you hold no power in this family dynamic, which is actually WHY domestic violence is able to continue. Domestic abuse is about an imbalance of power, the abuser holding all of the power, thus the ability to flex whenever they feel the need. Anyway‚Ä¶ as a mandated reported you are required by law to report each event, correct? How can you do that, given your current situation? As long as your mother is unwilling to leave, you are in an impossible situation, my friend. Get the hell out before you face legal action! Your mother will leave only when she is ready to face the reality of her marriage, not before. As a person who escaped an abusive marriage I understand this. You cannot save her, you can only save yourself. Do so. Now. Good luck to you, OP!	Much-Yesterday5871	reply	na	na	na	0.18354423344135284	weak	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
Moving out will help you, I feel.    Alcoholics need someone to help them function so they can drink.   So oddly, it might help him to have nobody to fill that need for him and he might seek help, go to AA or get treatment.   Just a thought.

"TW ab*se and attempted m*rder.
So, my mother abused me for 15 years. She's hates me even before I was born, and especially after my dad left when I was three. She's told me multiple times that I was the worst thing to happen to her, and she has tried to 'remove' me once when I was nine. For as long as I can remember, I never expected to survive past 18, and if I did, I always planned to run away and never look back. When I was 15, she divorced my step-father, and I stayed with him whilst she left, and I went no contact. That was my choice, and I'm better for it, despite the issues with my step-father (a story for another time). So why do I still feel like she abandoned me?"

"Hi, it is my first time writing here, so I apologize in advance.
I (23F) never had a good childhood. Not in terms of what my family was not financially stable they couldn‚Äôt afford to give me a better life. They were and they still are (thank god) pretty wealthy. For that I consider myself to be extremely lucky. The problem lays in the constant physical and emotional abuse I had to face every day. 
My dad was never home and my mom would get mad at the smallest things and, sometimes, I couldn‚Äôt understand why. 
The eeriest thing she would get furious about is sleeping schedule or napping. If she catches me napping, I will get beaten and screamed at with all sorts of names. Even if I am super tired during the day, nap is NEVER an option. Better go clean the dishes or read a book or play with your little sisters (they would never get as much abuse as I did, they just saw our mom doing it and kinda thought it was normal). 
The other thing that would trigger her is that if I slept until 11AM on the weekends. Very specific, I know. I still don‚Äôt know why exactly 11AM. If i woke up later than that, she would physically drag me out of bed and the cycle would continue. 
If you woke up, for example, at 10AM or even earlier, just laying in bed WAS NOT an option. You MUST do something like go to the kitchen and prepare breakfast for the whole family. If the kitchen wasn‚Äôt cleaned up properly or breakfast wasn‚Äôt made by the time mom and dad got up, you would get beaten and bullied by the whole family the rest of the day. 
Thankfully, I was sent to the boarding school by 16. Only there I discovered that my family isn‚Äôt normal. 
Due to all these sleeping habits my mother put me through, I have been having severe night terrors and often waking up with anxiety attacks. I never went to therapy because‚Ä¶well, it‚Äôs a whole different story. 
Currently I am living with my boyfriend (24), who has obviously noticed my‚Ä¶issues though I never told him and never planning on telling him. He is used to sometimes waking up in the middle of the night to my screams. 
Sometimes when I am alone in the middle of the day, I am finally able to take 30 mins naps, but after that I start feeling extremely guilty and anxious. 
I have many similar stories from my childhood that affected my life today.
I know therapy is always an option, but like I said, I have a whole different trauma regarding therapy and speaking to the strangers."	sadbabanan	post	21.06095762071964	female	White	0.9806780219078064	na	na	na	4	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

Hey, I‚Äôm so sorry you were treated so abominably that you developed trauma around the most normal human functions. I wish I could help you to be more gentle toward yourself. Why do you feel like you won‚Äôt ever tell your boyfriend? If you have absolutely no one to confided in, friend or partner or therapist, you will bear this burden alone and it will be heavier. You don‚Äôt seem to be processing it on your own. If your boyfriend doesn‚Äôt have abusive tendencies and won‚Äôt use this against you, maybe consider telling him.

"I was born with a physical disability and while it doesn‚Äôt really impact my daily life a great deal, the way it/I have been treated has caused a fair bit of emotional hurt. I have often felt my parents carry guilt, which makes them unable to accept that I might be struggling with certain things (especially bullying). I‚Äôve never really felt loveable and have often tried to cling to those people who have shown me even a scrap of affection.

Last year I left a traumatic religious environment in which I often received non-constructive criticism, personal attacks and blame. Things got so bad I developed anorexia. I had lived with these people for a number of years and in hindsight had joined them because I felt a desire, but also because I didn‚Äôt feel I‚Äôd be loved elsewhere.

I moved back home with my parents and while they are supportive and caring people, my father‚Äôs behaviour and way of speaking to me has continued these feelings of blame. I occasionally feel like I‚Äôm imposing on their lives. The anorexia has improved and I‚Äôm doing a lot better.

I have a partner who is incredibly supportive and who is literally the first person I‚Äôve ever come across to not make me feel like I‚Äôm doing the wrong thing or that I shouldn‚Äôt be myself. 

I‚Äôve suppressed a lot of this but am going to explore it in therapy. I‚Äôm glad for the insight."	Importer-Exporter1	post	17.50228068461362	male	White	0.0021736326161772013	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

My child was hit by a car a few weeks ago. It was all very scary. We went to the pediatric trauma center in an ambulance, but luckily there was only a broken bone. It could‚Äôve been so much worse. However, I‚Äôve been crying over any little thing since. Things that are not at all related to the incident.  I cry and feel pain in my chest like Im heart broken. What is wrong with me? Is this normal? How do I make it stop??	thinkingthoughts23	post	20.004300225571214	female	White	0.9934539794921875	na	na	na	6	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

When my son was 16 he swerved to avoid hitting another car head on. He went into a deep ditch, and his car rolled 4 times before stopping. I arrived just as emergency services did, and was with him as he was taken to the hospital. He spent 5 days in pediatric ICU. I was solid all thru the ambulance drive, the hours in the ER, all the way until he was situated into his room in Peds, then when he fell asleep I began to cry, and cry, and cry. I could pull it together while I was at the hospital, but the second I left I would fall apart. This went on for a very long time, I think for well over a month. I believe that this is probably a normal response to trauma and stress, at least it was for me anyway. I honestly dont know how it stopped, it just did. It would probably be a good idea if you could talk to your doctor about it? This was over 16 years ago for me, what I remember about that time is feeling so stressed and exhausted by so much crying. In hindsight it probably would have been healthier to seek help instead of trying to ride out my strain.	thinkingthoughts23	reply	na	na	na	0.9934539794921875	no	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"I did not go through the same experience as you but I had the same feeling of cry at literally everything when my daughter was in the NICU (born at 26 weeks). I couldn‚Äôt visit her as often as I wanted to because I almost died after childbirth and was very very ill for two months. 
I felt like I could lose her any day, that they would call me with more problems or a bad prognosis. 

It was very dark times‚Ä¶ Having such a heavy hole deep in your chest is a feeling I know all too well. Just the mere thought of the possibility of losing your child brings up all sorts of terrible emotions. 

But it‚Äôs okay to be sad. Don‚Äôt push that shit down. Cry when you need to. If you hold it all in it‚Äôll only get worse (hard to do that, especially as a mother we are used to putting on a fake smile no matter what).

If these feelings continue please talk to a doctor  because you don‚Äôt want it to spiral into something worse. I promise you‚Äôre not alone.

I'm so sorry this happened! How is your child doing? I'm not a therapist, so take everything I write with a grain of salt. But I think you feel heartbroken, because you are. You were suddenly confronted with the idea of your child being taken away from you. This can be very traumatic for parents. Please, give yourself some time! This can shake up so many fears in us and that's totally normal. Another commentor already suggested seing a therapist and I secong this. But also you can do a lot yourself at home. Any mindful techniques like yoga, breathing consciously and stuff like that can help so much. I remember after one traumatic event I experineced it took me 6 months to get back to feeling at least a little normal. So, be patient and be good to yourself. How is your child dealing with all of this? I hope you can all heal from this!

Hello fellow humans, ive been looking for a safe place to post this as we all know the internet can be a very harsh place. Any way here goes, ive been dating my s/o for around 7 months. We seem to have it together as a couple, for the most part. My s/o is a survivor of SA from the age of around 3 to 15. I am extremely supportive of her journey. I dont push her, (her words)outside her comfort zones when it comes to being physically intimate. So that being said we have yet to sleep together. Cuz of the society we're in I feel sometimes emasculated by this even though i do not believe having more sex makes you more of a man. I want to be intimate with  but sometimes I feel bad for even having these carnal desires. We have gotten close a couple times but nothing's ever come from it. I'm trying to be patient because I don't want in any way to be associated with her trauma I love her, however sometimes I feel like my head is going to explode. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Ttfn	Melodic-Firefighter4	post	16.650754277058326	female	White	0.003684546332806349	na	na	na	7	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"Overcoming childhood trauma is something your partner is in control of. You are not. You have no control. And if you did, the change that would result from it would be entirely unsustainable because that is something she must do on her own, albeit with support. You can support her along her journey and have open conversations about her desires and your desires, but ultimately if you're wanting her to heal so you can be physically intimate, I'd suggest recognizing where she's at in her journey, where you're at in what you want, and consider if this relationship can adequately meet your needs as it is now. If the answer is no, or not yet, then you might need to accept what it is, learn to compromise, move on, or some other solution other than pressuring your partner to heal so you can share intimacy. Having an open conversation with your partner about both of your perspectives is the only way to know for sure. 

Additionally, I would sit with the discomfort of feeling emasculated by society's expectations and reevaluate whether or not that is a value you consciously have or that has been given to you and that you've internalized. You feeling emasculated by not having sex with your partner who is a survivor of SA is a loaded sentiment. Owning your feelings so they don't unintentionally get projected is important. 

As someone who is healing my own SA trauma, I can feel when someone wants something but doesn't say it and when they're hoping for something I can't provide. Open communication is key. Someone who understands a trauma-informed approach to relationships is also important. Perhaps it would be helpful to learn about SA, the effects, the symptoms, the healing, and do your own work to unpack your own stuff/do your own healing."

"I appreciate your response, and it seems perhaps i wasnt thourough enough in my explanation and what i was looking for in response. I know a lot about childhood trauma and the effects, symptoms, and triggers that are associated with survivors of SA. Notice i say survivors and not victims. I want my s/o regardless of what she can give me in return because i love her. We do conversate regularly about her healing, wants/needs, desires, as well as my healing, wants/needs, and desires. We have journals we write to each other in daily because life gets to busy sometimes to sit and talk everything out and the adhd is strong in both of us. She wants to experience healthy sexuality (her words) because she never has. We both believe that can happen for her on her time. I dont pressure her or pass judgement or project my i securities because we have open lines of communication. Believe me I'm right where I want to be and so is she otherwise we wouldn't be here. Does our relationship need work? of course what relationship doesn't? We are both doing individual therapy and couples counseling as well as family counseling. 

I guess what I was hoping for by writing here was things other people in similar situations have done to help their partner heal or ways others have helped their parner see their sexuality as the healthy positive thing it can be between to consenting adults that love each other."

"Okay that clarification helps somewhat. 

In the last year, I've had my view of my own sexuality drastically shifted by my experiences with sexual partners. Lots of healing, lots of crying/communicating during or after the act, lots of triggers. It's a practice and needs to be continuously nurtured by the person carrying the trauma and supported by their partners/friends. It's going to be something that will require a lot of patience on both of your parts. Compassion. Boundaries. Accountability. And keep that open communication wide open and active. 

I was able to have those experiences because my partner and I developed a deep level of trust and sense of safety in the relationship which made me feel much more open to exploring the parts that used to scare me. 

A major reason why people who've experienced SA choose not to partake in sexual experiences is in part because the triggers they experience are absolutely overwhelming to their nervous system. The person they love can become accociated with ""threat"" if this isn't approached carefully. From personal experience, it's incredibly difficult to heal trauma without facing these triggers but what can really derail an experience is when our sexual partners internalize what they perceive of our traumatized behavior (especially when it's erratic or in t-brain mindset) and communication breaks down. This is why your comment about feeling emasculated really stood out because doing the very hard work of understanding the why, the root, the cause of that feeling is very important to your healing process. 

Sounds like maybe you understand, we all have wounds (from our culture, society, families) and whether or not we're actively healing our own wounds (and choosing behavioral patterns consciously) determines whether or not we will be able to show up for our partners in a healthy way when it comes time to support them. The best thing you can do for your partner is to heal your own wounds, baggage, and accept your limitations, etc.

When a person with a history of SA becomes intimate with their partners and their partner hasn't been doing their own work, high chances are their partners will react from their own wounds to the survivors' triggered behavior, instead of pausing and responding in a healthy way. Reacting this way could be retraumatizing and could cause a lot of harm for both people. 

The best things you can do are to embody consent, learn about sex positive practices/language, heal your own wounds (which can be hard bc you may not even be aware of them), research and implement a trauma-informed lens around your relationships (not just romantic), communicate often. 

Check out Saprea or some other online resources that could teach you some skills for navigating this dynamic and, if this type of abuse healing is applicable, could also be shared with your partner. 

(Note: even some ""survivors"" of SA don't like that term because it's still from the perspective of being abused or in the victim/abuser binary. I personally don't like victim or survivor and instead choose alchemist or ""history of SA"" because it reframes it into my perspective of what *I* am doing to overcome something that has happened to me, it's not a label painting me with a single story of who I *am*. People with these experiences are not a monolith and every person has preferences to the language that shapes their experience.)

Tl;dr please stop focusing so heavily on your partner's healing and think about your own. You are one half of that relationship and your personal sense of health/safety contributes to the overall level of safety in the relationship. Same for your partner. Communicate, be open, practice healthy boundaries, nurture safety."	Melodic-Firefighter4	reply	na	na	na	0.003684546332806349	no	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
Thanks. I like your 2nd response better. Maybe because i elaborated to give a better picture. Honestly it's not even so much that I feel  personally. it's more so when she talks about it with friends and family when I'm around and says we havent had sex yet and the men in the room seem to look at me funny. Maybe that's a me thing I don't know but I definitely don't project that on to her or I try not to anyway and if she feels I have I encourage her to tell me. I know my healing is important. Believe me I've had years and years and years of therapy. And only through therapy was i able to learn to compartmentalize my trauma to gain any sense of self acceptance. Through the rooms of Narcotics Anonymous I learned that I too can be accepted by other people. So I'm not saying my healing is done I'm just saying I've come a long way in my healing and an understanding who I am where my s/o hasnt had nesrly the same opportunities i have had. Plus she has mentioned she wants to try to learn to accept her sexuality in a healthy way and that's why I posted this whole thing. Thanks again.

Hi, so i still have a deep scar from my young adulthood. I thought i Was going to die and that every day for a year (hypochondria) and developed a high functioning depression from it. Went from clinic to clinic but never anything helped. No meds nor treatments. This scar is like something that never will go away and im gonna have to live with it but now i just cant. I distract myself from it All the time so my worst thoughts dont come up. I think i might not be able to live with it. Is it possible to get assisted suicide? I really dont want to die but i cant live with it.	SuddenEmergency1592	post	30.965427248858028	female	White	0.9970376491546631	na	na	na	4	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"For me suicide springs to mind every time I feel really stressed out. It's an escape hatch of sorts that presents itself. It might be possible to work on how you process stress rather than seeking to end your life.

However to answer your question: assisted suicide is a long process that starts with talking to your GP. It depends on which country you are in what the rules are and if it is even an option.

I do want to point out something: the last 5 posts you made are all very intense and show that you are in crisis. Very strong feelings and anxiety making you write a block of text with a lot of urgency. But 20 days ago you were doing a lot better. Your writing is more casual and the topics you talk about are much more relaxed and silly. Do you think it is possible you could feel that way again? Did something specific happen to get you into crisis mode? 20 days is a small enough time that you could possible be back in that mode of being in ... say 20 more days? Is it worth holding out for that long to see if you will be doing better? I think it would be worth looking into. 

Hypochondria (or medical anxiety, for me that last one covers better how it affects myself) is a real nasty mental condition because we are supposed to monitor our bodies to check if we need to see a doctor. So it's normal to wonder and check on weird feelings. But there is no easy way to establish if something is harmless or not. And if you look online the articles will always be about the worst cases. It sounds like you are having intrusive thoughts about this. 

For me it helps to take a fatalistic view on my health. Not pessimistic mind you though it may sound pessimistic. But [Fatalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism) in a sense is a giving up of control. If something is going to happen to my health, so be it. Nothing I could do to stop a cell from dividing weirdly or from an allergy to suddenly develop. All I can do is to make good decisions about my health but I can't control the outcome.

If you have a time machine tv that lets you see into the future and you could watch how I die, likely the thing that decides what will put me on the path of my death is something I couldn't change anyways. perhaps it is some drunk driver deciding to take a left instead of a right on the road. Or me standing next to a smoker one too many times. I could spend my entire life avoiding smokers (and I do because it stinks and I try to be healthy) but that's not going to avoid the drunk driver to get me in the end. In the same way I can avoid all road crossings but then getting an aneurysm. 

It's a bit morbid I admit but I'm trying to convey, that for me it helps to realize I cannot control my health and safety. I accept that I will get hurt in the future and that all I can do is to make the right choices when I have the options to do so.

But ultimately, stuff is still going to happen and that's ok. I don't have to control all the outcomes. In a way hypochondria is the same feeling that makes helicopter parents want to control everything about their children. but sometimes you just need to let the child (or yourself) find their own path.

The benefit of letting go of control is that you get so much more mental space back for yourself. So much less stress which means that the time you do have is spent in more pleasant ways and when something stressful shows up it is easier to react to. In the end it's how you live, not how you die, that is important. Anyways... I realize I have to explain way too much about my view on fatalism to make any amount of sense. It has worked out for me in the past, but nothing I say will change directly how you feel right now of course. I hope you find some mental space so that your anxiety levels go down and you will have more room to feel like yourself again.

""Just don't worry about it"" seems like an impossible suggestion. But at least try to tell yourself out loud that you can't control every aspect of your life and that's ok? that's genuinely the best advice I can provide in this."

With these funny posts i made i just distracted myself from whats always there. As soon as i start to feel my scar i become sad again and the thoughts come up.

"I‚Äôve known this guy about 3 months. We started officially dating a little over a week ago. I had a situation with a sibling years ago who made a school shooting threat and getting arrested (yes it has been handled and he was jailed), it was a whole thing and it caused lots of trauma for me that I can proudly say I‚Äôve been working through. I talked to BF about it and the different ways it‚Äôs affected me, just because I thought it would be important for him to know. We went out with his best friend and his best friends fianc√©e and it came out that he told them about my trauma. They all laughed about my brother ‚Äúalmost bombing the school‚Äù. I was embarrassed and shocked to say the least. I talked to him about why it wasn‚Äôt appropriate for him to tell other people about that and his apology seemed not genuine, maybe like he didn‚Äôt understand how severe the situation was.

As others with traumas and significant others, wtf do i even think? Should I have trusted him with something that big this early? Is he just not trauma informed?

I would call it off, TBH.

"this would be a valid reason for a breakup, at least for me. your trauma, personal history and mental health can't be shared without your consent. the fact that your BF did not recognize his mistake by exposing you like that and everybody just laughed is even worse in my opinion. if you share intimate details with a partner and they (by mistake) tell someone else about it, they should be able to admit their wrongdoings. otherwise it almost sounds like your trauma was a ""funny story"" or ""quirky fact"" to bring up with people for their entertainment.

If you still think it's worth salvaging because other things have been good, I'd have one very direct conversation where you both tell him it's a huge deal to you, but also ask a lot of questions to see if he truly gets it. Why does he think this is funny? Why isn't it a big deal? etc. Direct conversations are really really hard, but they've prevented me from sucking up my feelings and freezing. They've also helped me leave because I don't allow the other person to flatly say they agree without showing that they understand what's going on.

I believe you can call it trauma because it affected you so much in a negative way.	Popular-Formal-526	reply	na	na	na	0.9957607388496399	no	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
Idk if this is a trauma thing, and adhd thing, or an introvert thing. But I find myself being okay that the only people I have in my life are my family, my wife/kids, and my in laws (who I‚Äôm close to). That‚Äôs probably why I‚Äôm so reluctant to ditch my toxic family. But I feel I‚Äôm keeping them at arm‚Äôs length enough to not have a big impact on my life anymore. But then at times I‚Äôm envious of my wife going out with friends while I‚Äôm stuck at home with the kids. I know the social life isn‚Äôt really my scene but sometimes I really wish it was. I joined a couple dating apps that have ‚Äúlooking for friends‚Äù as an option. But find myself reluctant to actually talk to anyone. It‚Äôs just so draining. I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm doing. *sigh*	breezeboo	post	24.808881109468718	male	White	0.9979350566864014	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

I struggled/still struggle with substance abuse issues. My mom is a drug addict, my dad was there but not emotionally, I only ever had myself. I was maybe 14 and I went to my friends house. We‚Äôd been drinking and smoking. It was like a second home to me. I was always there so I felt comfortable coming and going as I pleased (while she was there). so she was sleeping and I left during the early hours of the morning. I wanted to go for walk, I loved walking. I didn‚Äôt wanna go anywhere specific just go for a walk around the neighborhood. I was wearing a really revealing outfit. Something a 14 year old probably shouldn‚Äôt wear. Fishnets, shorts, and a tank top and my hair was crimped. I looked like a hooker. And I was alone still buzzing. This Indian guy maybe about 25 stopped in a cab. He called over to me asking if I wanted a ride. I said yeah. I should‚Äôve said no. He took me to his place. He carried me on his shoulders. He put me on his bed and told me to be quiet through broken English. He proceeded to have sex with me with a condom, while he was on top of me I wasn‚Äôt making any noise, I was just wondering how I got myself there. I said I gotta go, he gave me 5$ and picked me up on his shoulders and carried me out. I saw an older woman at the top of the stairs. She saw me. I walked back to my friends place. I walked in, laid in bed with her. I started crying. I woke her up but in her half asleep state she told me not to be so dramatic. I never spoke about it. Now that I‚Äôm 21 the consequences of my reckless teen years are catching up. I have a boyfriend and an apartment and I cut ties with my mom, I still feel dirty, I compare myself to some pretty girls I see and I think ‚Äúthey probably never been through something like that in their life. They‚Äôre lucky. Why not me‚Äù I constantly feel guilty and gross and I feel like it‚Äôs my fault. I don‚Äôt wanna tell my boyfriend this he‚Äôll probably think differently of me. It‚Äôs embarrassing. It always comes back to haunt me when I‚Äôm alone at night. I‚Äôve made so many bad choices when I was younger. I need to be reminded that it wasn‚Äôt me who failed myself, it was the lack of authority and the lack of a role model.

"Ohhh, OP. At 14, you were such a child yet, with a child‚Äôs mind and expectations of life, of expectations and of how other people would treat you. You had absolutely no idea that when you walked out that door there would be a predator cruising the streets just hoping he would find someone defenseless he could overpower and abuse! That guy was completely aware that you were not a sex worker the minute he laid eyes on you. Did you immediately negotiate a price? Talk about what you were willing or not willing to do? People who consent to exchange sex for money treat this as a business interaction, so there is absolutely no ambiguity regarding what is going to happen, where and the length of time it will take. That person will walk into and out of the place where they have agreed to have sex, they certainly aren‚Äôt going to allow anyone to pick them up and hoist them like a sack of potato‚Äôs and carry them to a random, unsafe destination. That would not happen. Period. 

Taking a late night walk, fishnet stockings, being naive? These things do not make you a morally bad person. They do not require that you live the rest of your life with the ‚ÄòS‚Äô for Shame branded on your head, dear! That‚Äôs because you didn‚Äôt do anything to be ashamed of. You were just a kid taking a walk, enjoying the night, when some evil assed predator decided that you were vulnerable, and that he had the right to assault you. That was NOT your fault, OP! Nobody EVER has the right to force you to have nonconsensual sex. That is called rape. Or Sexual Assault. OP, you are feeling so much pain and self hatred because you feel like you were responsible for this adult monster SAing you,  but really? The only thing that you consented to was a ride home. How the hell does one go from  ‚ÄòYes, I‚Äôd like a ride‚Äô to him carrying you up a staircase? Easy. It doesn‚Äôt, unless his intent was always evil. 

It‚Äôs time for you to forgive that 14 year old self that you were. She really didn‚Äôt have a true understanding of how dangerous the world was, and she didn‚Äôt have anyone to guide her. She experienced a horrific trauma and had nobody to comfort her and hold her, telling her she would be ok, and that it wasn‚Äôt her fault. That nothing that happened was her fault, and that she wasn‚Äôt to blame. That she deserves to be treated with love and care and kindness‚Ä¶ because all of these things were true then, OP, just as they are so very true now. Be gentle with yourself, OK?? This was a hard thing you just did to tell your story. It‚Äôs hard to lay out your pain and shame, worrying that someone may think bad of you. Im here to tell you that you have never been bad. Honey, you simply could not have been. You were just being a child. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèº‚ù§Ô∏è"	Gorebay	reply	na	na	na	0.9921647310256958	no	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
The only person who should be ashamed of themself in your story is the fucking creep who raped a child. It doesn't matter in the slightest how you were dressed or what you were doing, a 14 year old is a child and only pedophiles are attracted to children.

Oh my poor friend, you are not the one who should feel guilty about anything.  That is what your abuser would have you feel, so that you are less likely to have him prosecuted for the crime that he committed against you.  The creepy ass predator who raped you as a child should feel guilty as hell.  You were a kid who was doing your best to make it through the world with the tools that you had to work with.  There is nothing wrong with you, and there never was.  And unfortunately, stories like yours are all too common.  Especially from kids who were neglected by their parents.  Those pretty girls you see are quite likely to have encountered their own monsters.  Be kind to yourself.  You didn‚Äôt know what you didn‚Äôt know.  It is not on you to know how to avoid predators that you could hardly conceive existed at the time.	Gorebay	reply	na	na	na	0.9921647310256958	weak	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"im getting sent to my dads tomorrow. i (23f) have been depressed at a new scale lately and was previously sharing a room with my niece (14f) and like a week and a half ago she was told to move to a different room and wasnt told why. i had been informed why a week later, my sisters bf accused me of grooming her. which i didnt. i would never. i have been groomed and worse in the past and was heavily effected by it. he claims hes saw signs for a while, and the signs were; me randomly hugging and braiding her hair, and spending a lot of time alone with her. i explained it all to my sister how its a sign of affection, and me and her literally shared a room and ive been recovering because i was raped a few weeks ago. but that didnt matter. and now she is sending me to my dads and im afraid ill do something terrible. i have relapsed into self harm and have really bad suicidal thoughts. im afraid of asking for help because they'll probably think im doing it for attention or something, i really don't want to feel this way anymore.

I think my emotions are a bit fucked and I hate how there the master of them right now.

"You were certainly violated, and I'm so sorry that happened. I'm so glad you made it out alive, and I'm impressed you did so without losing anything other than a rented bike. That shows more smarts than you might realize.

I'd completely understand if your emotions are all over the place. It's important to try to notice when you're ruminating, and then take some next steps. 

If you're feeling overwhelmed, and want to center, you can try breathing exercises. They help get control over your body. 

Distract yourself with a game of Tetris. 

Talk to a friend. Bonus points if you can tell them what happened and that you might need some support. 

Try to eat healthy and stay hydrated. Take care of the body the best you can.

You are in no way a coward. A bike isn't worth getting assaulted or getting stabbed over.

I would find a support circle whether that's through friends or family. Someone you trust really.

I would also find an avenue to vent your frustration. The anger can last a while, finding a healthy avenue whether through a hobby, music, whatever can definitely help as the emotions have somewhere to go.

"Warning (long post) 

My mom has always been a little off. When I was young I never really noticed it but once I got a bit older probably around 10 years old, I started seeing how she acted. 

To cut her some slack she had a rough childhood, her parents got divorced at a young age. Stepfather was neglectful and never treated her anything other than a ghost. Had to protect her younger sibling from the neglect. That whole thing. 

But anyway, my mom has certain things she does that are really stressful for the rest of my family. She isn‚Äôt quite a narcissist  but I‚Äôd say close. Whenever she has any kind of inconvenience she acts so dramatic. Constantly sighing and making everyone feel negative around her and when asked whats wrong she goes ‚Äúoh nothing.‚Äù And continues to act like that. 

Shes basically a Karen. 

She can legit have mini tantrums by stamping her feet like a toddler if my dog for example comes in the house with muddy paws or if my sister or I don‚Äôt let her help us with schoolwork and stuff. 

My mom and dad‚Äôs relationship has become the definition of ‚Äúhappy wife, happy life.‚Äù And I can see my dad is really struggling to keep dealing with her. He loves her, but he isn‚Äôt happy. I can tell he hates his life‚Ä¶ She never cares about him or what he likes doing. Its all about her, for example my dad loves mountain biking. She sits around the house all day doing nothing then when my dad says he‚Äôs gonna go for a ride she gets all bothered and starts being all passive aggressive. 

She almost always claims no one does anything around the house. She aggressively cleans (currently doing it right  now) by banging everything around, walking loudly. Just making any and all noise possible to be sure we all KNOW, she is the one cleaning. She‚Äôll empty the dishwasher like a mad man. Just BANG! CLANK! SMASH! Scrub the floors with so much force. Even go as far as to the power washer to try clean the shower. And if we ask her whats wrong or how we can help she gets all like ‚Äúwell no one else is gonna do it!‚Äù 
And its not like we don‚Äôt help out around the house. We just don‚Äôt do it when SHE wants us to. Like I am planning to do the dishes a little later and she gets all irritated that they are not down NOW. 

She just constantly makes things about her. 

I mention something to her that I need a little help with and then she gets all bothered and says stuff like ‚ÄúI just have a lot on my mind, its been a hard day.‚Äù Stuff like that, and we try to be there for her but its never enough. She just constantly makes us all feel like we are not enough for her. 

She makes passive aggressive comments about not having a cottage, needing a bigger kitchen, wanting a bugger house. Just constantly making my dad feel like he isn‚Äôt enough. My dad has worked his butt off for the whole time I‚Äôve known him. He‚Äôs given us everything he can, his love, his passion, sacrificed many of his own dreams and passions so my sister and I can be set up at good schools and one day be well rounded adults, a good roof over our heads, food on the table, extra spending money on games and nice things. Its not like we are a poor family. I‚Äôd say middle/upper muddle class. 

She even makes my dog cower away when she cleans, cleaning is the worst part for me. Its the constant banging and loud noises that get my anxiety really going. My stress level immediately increases whenever I hear even a cupboard door shut a little too loudly. 

I am most worried about my dad though. He is getting older, and dementia runs in his bloodline. I don‚Äôt know how much more time he has and I want him to be happy more than anything. My sister and I are both in Uni now, frequently come home to visit, and I can see how much being alone to deal with her has taken a tole on him. I can‚Äôt make him do anything as he is his own person but, I honestly wish they would just divorce.

Its just walking on egg shells with her, the whole day revolves around how my mom is acting. Cause we can‚Äôt do anything to stop it. If shes grumpy, then shes grumpy, if shes happy, only a matter of time before she becomes agitated. Its her way of expressing her stress that is making this so hard, my sister and I frankly don‚Äôt care about her much anymore. We‚Äôve given up on having a nice relationship with her years ago, but that doesn‚Äôt make it any easier to cope. 

I know its not my job to make her happy. Frankly I don‚Äôt even care, but the way she acts is causing my family so much stress and unhappiness and I‚Äôm just so sick of it. 

I honestly wouldn‚Äôt be too surprised if one day I find out that shes hit my dad before or even tries to hit my sister and I one day‚Ä¶ 

I am terrified of becoming a wife like her someday‚Ä¶ 

I don‚Äôt want to bring a guy home to this someday. I am always checking myself to make sure I am not acting like her. I don‚Äôt even want to get married because of the risk of someone becoming ‚Äústuck‚Äù with me if I end up like her.
I am just so lost, and so tired of her acting this way‚Ä¶ I feel like this is abusive behaviour but I don‚Äôt know"	EmieDigital	post	16.454786820428875	female	White	0.9991594552993774	na	na	na	2	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"Trigger warning: sexual abuse.

I have struggled with major depression for the last 10 years of life and most of this stems from the abandonment of my dad when I was 3, he then passed away when I was 15. However, about year afterwards, my mum told me that she caught my half brother from my dads side over top of me with his pants down when I was 2. I‚Äôm honestly not even sure how the conversation came up. She went on to tell me that it was the reason why we moved to New Zealand (I was born in the states). I honestly don‚Äôt know the details because I quite frankly didn‚Äôt want to know because I was really embarrassed. Since then, I have felt extreme guilt, that I was the one who broke up my family. But how do I process this if it‚Äôs impossible to remember? Before I was told, my mum openly expressed how much she hated my brother but I never knew why but I always had the feeling that he did something to me. Looking back throughout the years, during my childhood and teenage years, I can pick out points that possibly correlate to the abuse but how can I be sure? I am feeling really confused and I get really embarrassed when people question the feelings it has caused when I was only 2. Any help would be appreciated."

"I've been told that I have unresolved trauma, but I don't believe it; trauma is something entirely different to me.
However, I'm aware that I have some issues, and have been through a few stressful situations in the past, so I'll try to summarize what I remember.


For the first few years of my life, I was raised by my mother and grandparents because my biological father abandoned me before I was born; I never met him or knew who he was.
My mother hated him and was depressed, so I never asked her any questions.

When I was small, I overheard my mother and grandmother arguing about me, and for a long time, I was scared of being placed with another family.
The memory is hazy, but it really stuck with me (as an adult, I discovered what it was about).
Around the same time, my mom introduced me to her partner (calling him uncle), but even though they eventually married, I've never been able to get along with him and when he tried to play the ""tough"" dad, I completely lost it.
He's good, but shamefully dumb.

When I was about 11, I started to feel unwanted, wondering if I'd been adopted, why my father had fled, if I was loved, and secretly going through my mother's stuff looking for old letters, pictures, and so on, but I never said anything.
I know, I was a fucking idiot.

I was prone to rage, and I recall using sexual fantasies as a coping mechanism since I was 8, and acting out sexually a few times when I was 9 (nothing serious, but I clearly had some boundary issues).
However, for unknown reasons, in my adulthood, sexual arousal merged with violence. That is, I have a sexual deviation.
I was probably 13 when I noticed it, but I didn't realize what it was until recently (and I still don't fully get it). Nobody in my life knows about this, and it must stay that way.

In school I was doing ok, but being an introvert made me an easy target for bullying (especially in middle school).
From 2 to 5th grade, there was also a teacher who used to yell an inch from my ear and slap my head whenever I made a mistake, calling me lazy and stupid. I was just dyslexic.
In high school, things quickly improved.

Following a diagnosis of problem behavior in my teens, I was prescribed Paxil, an SSRI (for 5 years),  which fucked me up even more, causing serotonin syndrome, and leaving me restless, empty and angry all the fucking time.
The fact that I was also drinking didn't help.

As an adult, I was diagnosed with ASPD and bipolar II, that causes rapid mood swings. I don't need meds and I'm not psychotic.
However, I had to undergo CBT, which was a huge waste of time. I still have anger issues and am a control freak (which used to drive my ex insane). 
So far, the only thing that has helped me vent, aside from porn, is staying physically and mentally active. 
But nothing feels satisfying enough, so I'm constantly switching to something else.

I think I also have an alcohol addiction, but I don't consider myself an alcoholic, I can function normally. I used to be addicted to benzos and codeine, and would go to work high, but I was able to quit.
I occasionally smoke dope, although I've found that it makes me very aggressive.

My mother has opened up more about my father over the years, which pisses me off every time and I still haven't figured out why. 
I love her, but our relationship has always been complicated.
Anyway, I did my own research and found how he died (though the circumstances surrounding his death are still unclear).
But despite everything I know, I still have a lot of doubts.
And given the circumstances, I'm sure I have half siblings somewhere, but I honestly don't give a damn.
I never missed my father.

My question is, could that be considered trauma? 
And where did the sexual aspect come from? Has anyone else had a similar experience?"	Back_in_the_Woods	post	15.618157633511188	female	White	0.013858480378985405	na	na	na	12	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

Hey friend. I‚Äôm really sorry about everything that you have gone/are going through. If you would like to talk further feel free to dm me. I think you absolutely have trauma. Trauma isn‚Äôt always what people assume like war veterans or being shot or shit like that. A lot of different things can cause trauma. Your teacher screaming at you and hitting you probably caused trauma, among other things you mentioned. Even if you don‚Äôt feel ‚Äútraumatized‚Äù‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt. Now for the sexual stuff, I don‚Äôt know but I relate. I think there‚Äôs a strong chance you could have been assaulted or sexually abused or something as a child and might not remember it. Unfortunately thats fairly common and I think that‚Äôs what my deal is. But I also became very sexual at too young of an age and acted out sexually in really weird ways and had/have very concerning sexual issues/fantasies/kinks. Also another thing to keep in mind is that some mental health issues are genetic. I don‚Äôt know which ones or if they all are, I‚Äôm pretty sure bipolar is. So since you didn‚Äôt know your Father, he could have suffered from some mental health issues/disorders and could have passed them down to you? Sorry I am not a mental health care professional at all just another person with problems. I hope I didn‚Äôt upset you by anything I said but I‚Äôm here if you need to vent about anything. I do not judge at all. Take careüñ§	Back_in_the_Woods	reply	na	na	na	0.013858480378985405	strong	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"That's a valid question. Especially bc the term gets tossed around so much.


Trauma is different for every person, bc it is not about the event itself, but our capacity to process it (or not).


For example, it is estimated that 8-20 percent of the ppl who witnessed 9/11 developed PTSD. Why some ppl and not others? Bc each person has different capacities, different levels of sense of personal safety, different backgrounds, different levels of support.


Knowing that you were raised without a parent who abandoned you, not being able to talk about it, knowing your mother was depressed (and therefore unable to properly meet your developmental needs for safety, security, support), and hearing your caretakers argue about you, leading to a fear of further abandonment, means your basic needs for connection and security weren't met.


To learn more about this, check out Attachment Theory.  Also check out IFS Internal Family Systems therapy - it's good for addressing childhood trauma. 


The addition of the ""uncle"" in your life probably exacerbated those issues.


I recommend, if available, seeking a trauma-informed therapist (not all therapists are trained to handle a trauma history).


Also, CBT is not recommended for ppl with a trauma history bc it invalidates our thoughts and feelings and experiences. Lack of validation is one of the root causes of childhood trauma in the first place, so the experience can be retraumatizating."

"No worries, you haven't upset me in any way, thank you for your response.

You're right, I've never felt ""traumatized"", and my childhood wasn't all that bad, that's why I'm skeptical.
I'm not aware of any mental illnesses in my family other than depression, and from what I've heard, my father was a very intelligent and normal man. I don't know about my other relatives.

Goddamn! I'm sorry to hear you've been sexually abused; no one should ever have to go through that shit, especially a child.
Without going into too much detail and potentially triggering someone, my fantasies are quite twisted. I get sexually aroused by watching brutal violence such as torture, gore, and so on.
To me, it's just like watching porn. I know it sounds bad like I'm a fucking creep, but trust me I'm not. I'm a normal person.
Anyway as far as I know, I've never been abused, and I'm sure I'd remember it by now.

Thank you for your words. It definitely fucked me up but I‚Äôm mostly ok now. I completely relate though with the fantasies and stuff. I‚Äôm the same with violence and gore and some other taboo stuff. I‚Äôm pretty embarrassed and ashamed of it I feel like I‚Äôm a bad person but I‚Äôm also a pretty normal person and have a normal sex life but man the shit in my head or the things that turn me on can be pretty fucked up.

"I think I get what you mean, it's like having two personalities, one of which is fucked up.
But you shouldn't feel bad or ashamed about yourself, you did nothing wrong.
Everyone has secret fantasies, and some can develop philias; when and how this happens varies by person.
It could be the result of abuse, genetics, or both. 
That doesn't mean you can't have a normal sex life.
Of course, if these fantasies cause you too much distress, then it's a different story.
Personally, the urge to watch that stuff can be fucking intense at times, I mean, Jesus! I can barely concentrate,  but once I'm satisfied, I almost completely forget about it, as if it never happened.
So, as long as nobody finds out, I'm cool with it.

"Hi. I recently started therapy for a very traumatic upbringing. My therapist suggested I find an outlet to post my journal entries and I figured Reddit would be a good site.

***No Voice to Scream***

Mom doesn't know about the terrors, but I can't blame her. None of them know. They happen and I'll kick and punch, but I never scream. I wake up, still feeling his hands over my mouth. I try to scream, but my voice is gone. He stole it from me I think. I get visions of it...of him during the day, and I freeze. reliving what happened over and over. Body parts touching me that shouldn't. Hands that hold me in ways I shouldn't know. But no one can ever know. As when I try to tell them, when I try to scream out my horror, his hand covers my mouth again, and I scream no more."

"I‚Äôm writing this immediately after my first session with a new therapist. I‚Äôd prepared for the session by writing a short list of things I‚Äôd learnt from my previous therapist as well as what I wanted to work on now and as I was reading my list out, I got choked up talking about my childhood and my relationship with my parents. 

I‚Äôve been on my healing journey for 12 years now, and I understood pretty early that my parents had a hand in my poor mental health and I really thought that in the last few years I had come to terms with it but literally the second it came up I started crying - does this mean I‚Äôm still processing it? Although I have issues still, I feel more healed than I even have in a holistic sense, but surely a healed person can endure talking about their childhood without immediately tearing up. Is it just that processing/healing looks different for everyone and this involuntary bodily response is something that will go away with time, or am I still in the trenches?"	fuqaaaaallthis	post	27.167182209866	male	White	0.990760326385498	na	na	na	6	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"Listen, I don't know if you've fully processed your trauma or not, but I know for me being able to cry about it signifies that I have at least begun that process.

We have not quite reached our participant numbers, so If anyone is willing and interested in participating, please see the information and link below. 

I am currently recruiting for my Masters of Clinical Psychology research project at Federation University Australia. We are looking in to the impact of childhood experiences on memory for literacy and numeracy.

The survey does not contain any noxious content, but does ask some brief yes/no questions about certain childhood experiences which may be triggering. Helplines (if in Australia) and online support resources (if international) are listed throughout the study.

While there may not be any direct benefit to participants who complete the survey, the research will go towards furthering our understanding of the neurological impacts of childhood experiences.

"I'm an old guy and have a small novel I could write about my life, and the role trauma shaped who I am today.  I was in a toxic work situation in my late 30s and 40s that was out of control.  I was making more money than I had ever made in my life, but management was using my mental health treatment to leverage against me in performance reviews.  It got to a point where other employees felt comfortable enough to humiliate me at dinners or meetings.  One time a coworker, who was jelous of my national performance stood up in a restaurant screaming obscenities at me (she was probably drunk 8am meeting) - this was in front of diners including 5 professionals I had know from childhood.  We all worked for a giant multinational pharma company, and I probably had a good defamation case, and later a strong ADA case.  

Net net I let it slide, the top producer nationally in my company had such low self esteem I let crap like that slide.  I knew if I pushed for the rep (who was a drinking buddy of the Area Manager) would eventually end my career.  

20 plus years later I have days where I dig up these traumas and they make me burn inside.  If only I had a tape recorder on that day or at that meeting - I would have recovered hundreds of thousands in punitive damages if not millions.  Bad luck, just before iPhones.

I had a bad day today, went down memory lane and feel horrible this evening.  I have done thousands of hours of CBT, book reading, group - all have helped but I still feel broken.

I am not a violent person, however I have fantasies of retribution towards a handful of people who prospered while I, national rep of the year - bla bla bla had a career that was torpedoed over the time at that company.  Tonight's fantasy is dark alley with a Sig-sauer 40 with a nice can on the end of the barrel.

Obvious not healthy thinking.  Anyone who has ways to break that kind of thinking?  I thought I had moved on, do good for a year or two and then rage comes back.

"I hear you.  I had a hellish miserable career, also fairly lucrative - I walked away *twice* and came back, bc somebody's got to put food on the table and a roof over our heads (my partners...weren't the greatest)


There's no question that CPTSD contributed to the stressy mess at work by making all the bad parts that much worse, although it was also a terrible career for women.


A lot of therapy, and a lot more work reading psych research (texts meant for therapists), and a lot of journaling  has helped me get the ship turned around. The biggest breakthrough was discovering IFS Internal Family Systems therapy - that's been a game changer (therapist not required, decent resources on yt).


Righteous anger is actually a healthy emotion (something I didn't realize) - it causes us to take action to protect ourselves when our boundaries have been trampled. It's a survival mechanism. 


The issue, for those of us with a trauma history, is what to do with all the anger that's been stored up inside of us that we couldn't express when we needed it. A child has no resources to fight against abuse - it could backfire and make things worse. And anger is most often a career killer if expressed, so professionals learn to not display it. 


When the old anger comes bubbling up (like any other old traumatic wound that hasn't been fully processed yet), first of all acknowledge it and validate your experience and validate how you felt in the moment and validate your righteous anger. I journal bc it helps me to get it all out of my head and tangibly down on paper. I then either do something physical (like exercise) or I draw (which can get...interesting), which still has a physical component.  Lastly, I spend cuddle time with my two big fluffy soft sweet dogs (husky and Newfoundland). Cuddling up with them makes them happy, too, so everybody wins. I'm a big believer in the therapeutic value of pets.


That last step, I believe, is critical. Something for comforts. If my dogs aren't available, I listen to soothing music, eat comfort foods, watch yt videos of kittens and puppies and soft baby lambs and bouncing baby goats, and wrap up in a soft blanket. I also carry something soft in my backpack. Give yourself the gentleness and warmth and care and understanding that you needed back then. You deserved it then and you deserve it now."

I‚Äôve recently started CBT therapy. I wasn‚Äôt 100% what it was going into it. I went through physical abuse in childhood and am struggling with processing memories that are coming back to me that I think I suppressed. In my therapy however we mainly focus on my negative thinking and how it leads to negative behaviours. Although I‚Äôm finding it useful to identify and challenge I‚Äôm not 100% sure it‚Äôs right for me. I don‚Äôt but also do want to talk about my past. I‚Äôve never told anyone verbally about things that happened and I think it would help for someone to help me just get it out. I think if I did I would be able to process and move on. Maybe I want to hear what someone thinks of it as I‚Äôm very confused by some of it (if some of what I experienced was sexual abuse etc). I was thinking about telling my CBT therapist but I also don‚Äôt want to ruin his plan or take things somewhere where he doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable going or him thinking ‚Äòwhy are we talking about this , this is cbt and we want to tackle now problems‚Äô and I don‚Äôt want him to feel awkward about not being able to hold the conversation I‚Äôm after. 

(Separate side note, I fill out weekly mood diaries for him and I‚Äôve occasionally put something quite person down like if I‚Äôve made myself sick and he doesn‚Äôt bring it up at all but brings other stuff up like feelings/thoughts‚Ä¶I‚Äôm trying to not take it personally but it feels a bit humiliating like I‚Äôve over shared or something.)

So just wondered if anyone has experience in therapy for trauma and what that therapy was? Did it look at the underlying cause?"	Neverneverland1888	post	29.945102993506406	female	White	0.9978426694869995	na	na	na	22	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"I've seen numerous articles, posts and comments stating that CBT can do more harm to trauma survivors because it essentially feels like a form of gaslighting.

"IME no, not at all.

I've been listening to a great podcast about EMDR called Notice That that had an interesting part about the contrast between EMDR and CBT that I think captures it fairly well, funny enough in the context of integrating them (back when EMDR was new and CBT was the only respected modality)
https://pca.st/5nohhu1a

The gist of it is that EMDR (and I think other trauma therapies) are ""bottom-up"", that is, treating the bodily experience as the first and most important part to connect with, where as CBT is ""top-down"", treating the thoughts themselves as the thing to work with. But trauma is not stored in thoughts, it's stored in the body. Treating the thoughts can leave the bodily stored trauma entirely untouched, making it sometimes seem useful on the surface but never really addressing the underlying problem and at best getting slight improvements. (Apparently, what's considered ""effective"" for CBT is 20-25% symptom reduction, whereas they claim well-done EMDR aims for and can achieve 100%)

After listening to this and some other episodes I'm really hoping I can find a skilled EMDR therapist at some point. I've had a shitty one before who wasn't very good at doing it, but that's all. And I've had many many CBT therapists who did diddly squat."	Neverneverland1888	reply	na	na	na	0.9978426694869995	no	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"Just my two cents. CBT is absolutely useless if you have unhealed trauma. Trauma is not fixed by gaslighting yourself into feeling better. That‚Äôs how I look at it. 
Therapists who know your background should actually be recommending you seek trauma therapy from a therapist well versed in trauma really. 
One therapist I had actually blamed me for not getting better after the 6th session. Which left me very suicidal. 
Yea bitch. Sorry that walking isn‚Äôt fixing the constant fear response living inside my body which now I can‚Äôt understand why ‚Äúit‚Äôs not going away‚Äù and for ‚Äúholding myself back‚Äù. 
I do think CBT can be beneficial once you have healed and have the safety in your body to move forward onto this next part of your journey. 
CBT seems to often be the therapy most insurances cover (this is my understanding). 

I did trauma focused therapy (inner child, polyvagel, EMDR) which helped immensely. I am now onto DBT , which I feel is far more superior in healing than CBT.

Yes, and it depends on the nature of your trauma.

"You‚Äôre totally correct. To heal trauma it starts from the bottom up. As it‚Äôs stored internally inside your body until you learn to somstically release the memories that are stored with it. 
Which is often why many trauma survivors will constantly have unhealed illness that don‚Äôt seem to get better despite 26 trips to the dr for the constant migraines I am having multiple times a month. Yet when healing their trauma finally and releasing it from their body the migraines disappear ?  Coincidence. Nope. 

I had constant stiff joints daily. I actually thought I had rheumatoid arthritis. I was overweight so I thought it was that too. I also had constant stiffness in my feet. In the morning when I woke up I could barely move and it hurt to get out of bed and walk. To be clear. I was 43 lol. I moved like I was 78. 

When I healed and stopped living in a constant fear and immobilized state those pains , stiff joints and backache disappeared. I sometimes get aches and pains but nowhere near where I had. 

The body keeps the Score by Bessel Van der Kolk is honestly one of the best books to read or listen to to understand all of this. It‚Äôs a dry read but it really helped me understand things from a very different perspective on healing and how trauma manifests inside of you."

"6 years ago I broke my right foot at work. I just stepped wrong while I was running around getting things done. I just broke my left foot, fell on wet pavement. This is long sorry.


This brought back memories of last time. I managed to get to the break room on the broken foot, put my foot up, took off my shoe and sock to see, it was massively swollen. I was a vet tech. The veterinarians came to see what was going on and said oh yeah that looks broken. I remember my foot being up there looking like hell, and the office manager brought me water and Advil. But that was the end of their giving a crap. I told the office manager I'd be going to urgent care and she got mad at me. She didn't want me to go. No one offered me a ride. No one offered to help me get to the cab. 


I was so afraid of losing my job at that toxic place that I didn't want to make it a workers comp case. They would've killed and fired me. On my broken foot I walked to my locker, took my clothes to the bathroom, changed out of my scrubs, walked up to the front of the office to get the cab, walked out and into the cab. No one offered me any help. I was just ignored. 


I absolutely should have made it workers comp. I was frequently threatened with losing my job while I was on crutches for a month. They demanded a doctor's note, then said the one I got wasn't detailed enough. Doctors notes are not supposed to be detailed. I had to call the office and have them write a note that explicitly said I'm on crutches for at least 4 weeks and cannot work. This was ridiculous also because everyone saw my crutches on Instagram and some of the staff saw them in person when we dropped off the first note. 


I went back earlier than the doctor wanted me to. I went back in a boot and with a note that said I needed frequent rest breaks. The office manager barely said anything to me. The practice owner said nothing. We had a staff meeting and there was no hey she's back after a month! Other people noticed that but no one said anything. I decided to be bold. I told the office manager I was hurt that she didn't seem to care I was back. She looked me in the eye and went, ""We were F**KED without you."" I was like jesus I didn't break my foot on purpose. She went on about how the only other full time tech had to work almost every day. I was like I feel terrible about that but what could I do. I was crying. She yelled at me to stop freaking out. 


Every time she saw me resting my foot she gave me a death stare. I felt like I couldn't rest. I was doing a lot of physical stuff. Climbing stepstools in the boot. Carrying things. Nobody gave me a break. I made a lot of mistakes. I'd been gone and depressed for a month and I wasn't getting back into the swing of things. After like two weeks they gave me a performance review. I was told they were gonna give it to me the day I broke my foot. They waited. It was 100% negative. If this employee existed there's no reason they wouldn't have fired her already, there was not a single good thing in it. I want the best but I was never *that* terrible an employee. They made me sign it. I'm convinced they were pushing me out, a new girl had just started. I found a new job and quit. I should have filed for temporary disability and took time off because I was not in a mental state to work anywhere and I was physically exhausted. But I was still afraid of making them mad. The practice owner was known to call other vets in the area and tell them not to hire people she didn't like. 


Fast forward, I couldn't keep a job anymore. I'm on SSDI now. My symptoms weren't new after this but they were 20x worse. I had always had trouble keeping jobs but now it seemed impossible. This story is insane right? Like, I'm not just too sensitive? I'm having flashbacks. Thank you for reading.

"I didn't read your entire post - it sort of triggers memories, but I got the gist of what was going on.  First thank you for posting and putting your psyche out there on social media (often high risk and low reward).  You helped me though.  I'm an old guy and have a small novel I could write about my life, and the role trauma shaped who I am today.  I was in a toxic work situation in my late 30s and 40s that was out of control.  I was making more money than I had ever made in my life, but management was using my mental health treatment to leverage against me in performance reviews.  It got to a point where other employees felt comfortable enough to humiliate me at dinners or meetings.  One time a coworker, who was jelous of my national performance stood up in a restaurant screaming obscenities at me (she was probably drunk 8am meeting) - this was in front of diners including 5 professionals I had know from childhood.  We all worked for a giant multinational pharma company, and I probably had a good defamation case, and later a strong ADA case.  

Net net I let it slide, the top producer nationally in my company had such low self esteem I let crap like that slide.  I knew if I pushed for the rep (who was a drinking buddy of the Area Manager) would eventually end my career.  

20 plus years later I have days where I dig up these traumas and they make me burn inside.  If only I had a tape recorder on that day or at that meeting - I would have recovered hundreds of thousands in punitive damages if not millions.  Bad luck, just before iPhones.

I had a bad day today, went down memory lane and feel horrible this evening.  I have done thousands of hours of CBT, book reading, group - all have helped but I still feel broken.

I am not a violent person, however I have fantasies of retribution towards a handful of people who prospered while I, national rep of the year - bla bla bla had a career that was torpedoed over the time at that company.  Tonight's fantasy is dark alley with a Sig-sauer 40 with a nice can on the end of the barrel.

Obvious not healthy thinking.  Anyone who has ways to break that kind of thinking?  I thought I had moved on, do good for a year or two and then rage comes back.

i've never told anyone the details of this story and thinking about it now this seems like the best place to let it out. i feel like i need to for some reason. i (17f) was sexually abused for about 3-4 years by my mothers ex boyfriend. i don't want to hear anything bad about my mom she's the light of my life and i love her and don't blame her at all. when i was in about 5th grade, my mom started seeing this guy- a friend of a friend. he always seemed a little off but never in this kind of way. he was quiet, isolated himself a lot, and just from the surface seemed like he had some sort of mental illness. it was so much worse than that, me and my 2 younger siblings lived in a hell house for years. they were absolutely terrified of him, my sister especially. he used to call my brother fat (he was 9, it was baby fat and he's a healthy weight now) and tell him he needed to eat less junk and go out more, but wouldn't let us outside. we had to ask to do everything, we weren't even allowed to have snacks between meals unless we practically begged and even then he seemed pissed off about it. since he liked me (more than he should've) i would ask him anything we wanted to do- go outside, play video games, eat- because he scared them and if i asked he was more likely to say yes. i'm so grateful to this day he never did anything he did to me to them. okay i feel like i need to put a severe tw here, sa of a child. i was probably about 11 when he started abusing me. he was in his early to mid 40's for reference. he would touch me anywhere he wanted, would hold me down to make sure i knew he was stronger than me, had me sit on his lap, tried to get me to kiss him, and touch him too. he would make sure i knew he could easily kill my whole family, take me, fully rape me, then kill me and himself. another tw- self harm/suicide. when i started self harming he would give me guns and knives and tell me if i really wanted to kill myself to just do it. he'd also put guns in my hand and put it up to his head and tell me if i wanted to kill him that i could i just had to pull the trigger. he would gaslight me- i never felt bad for him but he tried. if i tried getting away from him when he was trying to rape me he would call me a bitch and say one day i was gonna find him dead with his brains splattered on the walls. again i've never been this in detail and idk if this post will even stay up but i wanted to share my story. he never went to jail, never got any real consequences, and i live with this trauma every day. it's absolutely unfair and for awhile it made me wanna die. i have ptsd and depression diagnosed, and it's heartbreaking that the american system lets people like him get away with this every day. it's been 5 years now since it's been over and i still think about it all the time. i still have dreams about him, and he gets to live his life in peace. anyways yeah.	anonymousagainlol	post	29.74276847726827	female	White	0.007044220343232155	na	na	na	2	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"This is really just a trauma dump. 

(please correct me if I've made a mistake regarding the rules and excuse my writing)

My parents provided me with a good childhood, it was a little rocky and mistakes were made, but I had everything a child could need, and I am grateful for that. I did however have some bad experiences between the ages of 4 and 7 and it left me a little messed up. 

My grandma worked at our communities' daycare and watched over me and my sister. I suffer from short-term memory loss, so I have forgotten most of my time there. I do however remember the punishments I would receive for misbehavior. I am not talking about the spankings or time spent facing the wall, but the weird punishments my grandma would inflict upon me whenever we were alone.

She would force me into a high chair and slam the tray cover on my fingers if I tried to stop it. She would leave me there until I stopped crying but if I didn't she would usually return with a bottle of mustard and a spoon. I hated the stuff, so she would force my jaw open or plug my nose so she could forcefully spoon-feed me. I remember her yelling and spitting in my face, the clanging of the mental spoon against my teeth. If I spat it out she would slap me across the face, never enough to leave a mark. The worst part for me was when she'd drag the highchair into a small janitor's closet and leave me in there with the lights turned off and the door locked until I stopped crying

I still remember how much the straps hurt my shoulders and the pitch-black darkness. I would soothe myself by imagining elaborate scenarios in my head where my dad would bravely swoop in to save me. 

During grades 1 and 2, my parents would drop me off at the daycare after school while they finished work. No matter how hard I cried and protested, they wouldn't listen. I still don't know why I didn't give them the real reason why I didn't want to go but it didn't matter since my parents just assumed I was simply being a child.

This all finally came to an end once my mom's mom caught my grandma in the act. I don't remember how it went down but years later I was told she found me in the closet. My parents were informed and I was removed from the daycare. After that, my parents began fighting and I blamed myself for the divorce my mother was considering due to my dad shrugging off the situation. It broke my heart to find out that my dad, the hero I imagined kicking down that closet door and taking me away from that miserable closet, didn't see any issue. I didn't learn the context until I got older but my parents worked it out since then and I do not blame my dad for his actions since he was just another victim in this whole situation. After all that, life just kinda went on like nothing happened. I'd visit my grandma for dinners and holidays, we'd hug and say we love each other. she would still dish out punishments but nothing like what she did before. I would casually bring up the experience and make a joke of it. I assumed I had gotten over it since I no longer hated the taste of mustard.

I am now a hypersensitive 22-year-old and my grandma is dead. Over the last few years, I've been diagnosed with GAD, ADHD, and a Binge-eating disorder. I am also currently being screened for BPD. Every day is a rollercoaster of emotions, I can go from feeling empty and disconnected from the world to feeling every negative emotion at once. I smoke weed and drink to drown out the shame and disgust I feel for missing the attention and hurt I felt. I also believe those events somehow lead to me finding comfort in dark enclosed spaces and developing an interest in Feederism later in my pre-teens.

I hate that that happened and I hate the person I've become, but I guess things could have been worse."	Entire_Government346	post	15.926687158769827	female	White	0.9938591122627258	na	na	na	3	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

I don‚Äôt remember much but she would grab me by the head and throw me into the basement locking me in there for hours at a time. if I ever turned on the light she would come in and turn it off forcing me to stay in the dark all alone and terrified as a 4 - 5 year old. I would beg and scream for someone, anyone to let me out. She wouldn‚Äôt let me eat until I calmed down asking if I was ready to behave as if it was my fault. She forced me to sleep in a babies crib. Isolated me from the other kids. Would do all this in front of my sister too, probably screwed her up too. It didn‚Äôt stop until my sister told my parents that I get locked in the basement. Not as bad as your experience by any means, but screwed me up non the less. So I can‚Äôt even imagine what you are going through‚Ä¶ I suffer from severe separation anxiety, extreme fear of being alone. Trust issues‚Ä¶ from this situation But, I hope you know you are not alone. This stuff should NEVER happen to a child. It was never your fault. You were a kid, from someone who has mostly healed from these traumas, I want you to know it is possible, its hard and takes a lot of time but it is doable. Take time to sit with these feelings. Even if they suck. Talk to your dad about it. I‚Äôm sure he faces similar feelings if he suffered similar punishment as a child. Maybe you can heal together.

I'm so sorry that happened to you, you never deserved that. No kid deserves that, and it was wrong of her and wrong of your dad to brush it off and continue allowing her to have access to you after she was caught.

"I grew up never being enough and constantly criticized. I have just come to accept that I am not enough for anyone nor can I even function properly for myself. I feel defective and really fucked up. 

I have been cheated on in every relationship I have ever been in multiple times, told that I'm just not attractive anymore after having my daughter, and been turned down for porn. Just so many times for all of this that I am INCREDIBLY insecure, like psycho level, whenever the person I'm with so much as acknowledges another woman's existence. 

I've really been trying to not be insecure in this relationship. So much shit has happened though (not cheating) that today when it turned out he watched porn I just sort of..... I don't know. I got angry, I cried, I detached, I cried again, we aren't talking now because he's angry at me too, etc. I already didn't feel like I was enough because of what has happened in our relationship, but I have held onto his words to help ease my insecurities. He's always said he's a demisexual, that he's like me in the sense that once we're with someone we don't view other people like that anymore, and that he wouldn't ever have a need to look at another woman when he could look at me. For some background he wanted to be with me for ten years before I finally trusted that maybe somebody loves me and accepts me after all and I could embrace happiness.

"My fianc√© has suffered from epilepsy since the age of 13 but only experienced her first seizure after her dad's passing when she was 17. Since then she's had 4/5 seizures, the last time being in 2017. Throughout the day she has absence seizures (staring away or through you while you're chatting) they only last a second or two. But over the weekend, she had a huge seizure and I was there to witness it. 

&#x200B;

I was playing a computer game when I heard a loud, male-like scream coming from the bathroom, I knew she was in there having a shower, so I got up and started to call her name with no response. I ran to the bathroom to see her lying on the bathroom tiles seizing. I witnessed her face go from colour to grey, to blue in a matter of seconds. I immediately went into shock, lifted her head onto my lap and due to my panicking, I tried to open her mouth to give her mouth-to-mouth. 

&#x200B;

I managed to call for an ambulance, but while I was on the phone her eyes rolled from the back of her head to their normal position and she started to come too. It obviously took a while for her to realise where she was and where we were going when I had her in the car. 

&#x200B;

She's better now, it's been 5 days since her seizure but thought the day I will randomly see her pale/ blue face like it was that night. Every time I shut my eyes I see it. I can't let her do anything without me being present due to me being so traumatised. Luckily she's ok with this. But I'm forever scared and I don't know how I'll get over this! I've booked a session with a psychologist this weekend, and I've enquired about seizer training courses, which I feel will help. But I'm mentally hurting so badly! 

Will this ever get easier? Does anyone live with someone who suffers from epilepsy and has some advice? 

Thanks so much."	MynamesnotJake	post	22.07253289636122	female	White	0.9903222918510437	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"I feel unusually devastated and hurt when friends or peers doubt my capabilities to achieve a goal, or highlight a failure.

Example 1: when I was 24, I really wanted to move to this city (let‚Äôs call it ‚ÄúOrlando‚Äù) across the country. This was a few years before Covid, so WFH was not as common. I was unable to move to this specified city because I could not secure job prospects there. I spent the next year working really hard to improve my skillset and networking, and was able to finally land a job in that city. Which then allowed me to move there and sustain myself. My friend told me that they were ‚Äúhappy‚Äù that I finally made it out here because they started to think I was ‚Äúall talk‚Äù about moving and they couldn‚Äôt have been more proud. It was such a back-handed compliment, and I don‚Äôt even realized their poor choice in words. But I felt really hurt by this. I kept thinking about how hard I kept trying to accomplish my goal while adapting to roadblocks.

Example 2: in new city, I worked 75-80 hour weeks to get overtime. I was trying to save up money to buy a house. Home prices were soaring and I felt like I was racing against time to get in. I went from negative $8,000 net worth to positive $95,000+ over two years while living on my own. Not as a brag but to demonstrate the amount of energy I put into aiming for my goal. Ultimately, I had to return back to my original city and bought a home here because my significant other could not secure a job in ‚ÄúOrlando‚Äù. It made no financial sense to split us up when I now also secured a WFH job. I felt like my friends lowkey judged me for wanting to buy in ‚ÄúOrlando‚Äù but then bought a house in my original home. 

Example 3: I‚Äôm currently undergoing extensive studying to prep for a career change. On top of still working my normal 9-5 job. I‚Äôm constantly worried if people are judging me or waiting for me to fail and give up. These fears don‚Äôt matter, but I‚Äôm upset at the fact that I feel them. 


I feel like I have unresolved trauma. And I need some pointers as to what could he causing this so I know how to reflect inwards and confront it. 

I have fears of being misjudged, told I can‚Äôt do something, and being made fun of for things I put a lot of effort in.

Any ideas?"	JCTA618	post	21.29807962923669	female	White	0.990253210067749	na	na	na	3	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"When we need a certain level of validation or to be seen in certain ways in our relationships and we feel devastated and hurt when we don't receive it, there is a very big chance that we had an emotionally deprived childhood. 

I would begin with reviewing if my caregivers were invalidating, or overly critical and harsh.  If you did not receive proper mirroring, validation and reinforcement for your sense of self, unconsciously we will still be looking for this in our adult relationships.

"Hi

I have to state this even though it‚Äôs probably obvious, but any diagnosis from any post, would be a poor diagnosis. Not that I am any sort of professional that could diagnose you anyway. And I recognise you are looking for insight or guidance.

Here‚Äôs what I am picking up from OP:

It sounds like there‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äòpersecution‚Äô worries in what you say. Without needing to write out any memories here; 

Can you recall feeling misjudged often as a child?

Did you regularly experience false accusation, or unfair criticism from your parents/teachers/peers?

Did you ever feel guilty or ashamed of ‚Äòjust being you‚Äô? Who made you feel like that?


The last part of what you wrote was particularly interesting; ‚ÄúThese fears don‚Äôt matter, but I‚Äôm upset that I am feeling them.‚Äù

I think that single remark holds insight for you.

Is it other peoples judgement that actually gets you down? Or your own? If it‚Äôs your own, that fits with having critical parent figures in our lives.

"Short context: growing up, my dad was a drug addict, had a really bad temper, and was abusive. So he would yell at us and hit us, etc.

Now that I'm older, almost 23 y/o, when I am being screamed at by other people (yelling at the top of their lungs with tears streaming down their face and fists clenched), why don't I cry? I am oddly so calm and it frustrates me because I want to cry. I want them to see that screaming at me hurts me, but instead I just get completely numb and don't react.

This sounds a lot like dissociation. Others can probably give better info/suggestions than me, but your experience sounds a lot like ones I'm familiar with. Its a coping mechanism your brain uses trying to protect you, keeping you mentally/emotionally distant from the situation even if you can't get away physically. When you're safe, it's good to practice grounding, it can help 'bring you back'. I'd definitely recommend looking into it, it feels scary but it's a normal reaction, especially after repeated trauma	cl0udwine	reply	na	na	na	0.9936988353729248	no	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"When we feel threatened, there are a set of possible responses: fight, flight, freeze, or fawn are the major categories.


Freeze is a common one, especially if it was first developed in childhood. A child cannot fight adults, they can't leave their home/incompetent caretakers, and have few other resources to remove the source of the threat. So freeze/dissociation is a common learned response to intolerable inescapable repeating toxic stress.


I also consider it a pretty clever solution, given that it was developed by the mind of a child which didn't have access to a full adult toolkit, it was developed in the middle of a war zone, and developed by a child who wasn't getting their developmental needs met, either.


So, I love that young part of me for trying their best with almost nothing to work with. But it's also frustrating when those coping mechanisms become maladaptive in adulthood. The CPTSD freeze response can be difficult to interrupt bc it's been baked into our hardware while our brains and nervous systems were growing.


For example, I learned to not cry, no matter what, as a toddler. It wasn't until my 50s that I had finally progressed to the point that I could cry when I was upset or sad, sometimes. It's still a work in progress."	cl0udwine	reply	na	na	na	0.9936988353729248	no	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

I get very anxious when I'm touched unexpectedly, even if it's not my skin. This started after somebody kissed me unconsensually. Anyways whenever I'm touched without warning I get very scared and feel powerless. The feeling tends to be minor at the time and get stronger later in the day. However I really like being touched lovingly(hugs, cuddling) by people I know well and don't mind handshaking etc with those I don't know as well. I feel like telling everyone I meet about not wanting to be touched is impractical and would make a bad first impression. Any ideas on what to do?

"I have a lot of problems and so do everybody however, the ones I¬¥m talking about are things that my friends do not have, or anyone near me. I cannot interact with the opposite gender. I get so self concious no matter who this person is then. Sometimes it seems like I¬¥m just built that way and other times I feel it is because I haven¬¥t really had a male figure in my life, let alone father figure.

Another thing that annoys me is not finding people fun to be with. I feel like most of the people I meet are just my cup of tea. There is nothing wrong with however, I just do not seem to ""click"" with them. And if I do, because I do actually have friends, I have to change myself in a way I limit myself from being ""me"". Because of this, I cannot open to people. I have never once expressed what I truly feel to my friends because I feel they would never understand. THIS, I think is because it was always hard for me to tell my mom what I felt because of our circumstances. I rather cried myself to sleep or cried in the bathroom everyday for 4 years and suddenly then suddenly I stopped and started to bottle up my feelings instead.

It can absolutely change your personality. Your brains method for coping could be to just shut down emotional connections. Another thing it can do is mask. To everyone else you appear fine.

I posted on here as well as other subreddits a while back because I was, and still am, really struggling. After some reflection I now understand that stress and an unhealthy or unstable family dynamic that DOESN'T stem from abuse can still cause some of these trauma responses, but that seems to only be what's amplified my issues. Probable mental illness (I suspect OCD, ADHD, and anxiety) that has followed me around since my earliest memories contributed too, but there's still something else. I had so many triggers as a small child (some common ones, like violence, and then some that didn't make any sense, like a certain cartoon) that would fill me with anxiety and make me go quiet until someone asked what was wrong. Although I grew out of a lot of these senseless triggers, and have a few more personal ones that still don't make any sense to me, I experience the same symptoms when something scares me, and return to feeling like that completely helpless child, unable to do anything but be frozen in fear. Had nightmares as a kid, too, which is probably normal, but I had semi-recurring ones that plagued me with fear years after I had them. I feel like I may have experienced some traits of sexuality that are not normal in a child, but I don't remember them manifesting in behavior- just thoughts, which I carried a lot of shame over. I'm pretty childish now, with emotional regulation. I've had a barrier up as far back as I can remember that prevents me from being able to talk with people about these things, so I don't want to ask for therapy and don't know if it would work for me. (My mom tried to get me and my siblings into counseling when I was about 8 or 9 and I refused to speak with them about 'feelings,' it just never happened with me.)

Here's the thing about happiness - joy - it is an emotional state generated by our thoughts. We experience joy and happiness in a variety of ways. In short bursts like when we are with friends or at an event. And there is the sustained sense, and I think this is to what you speak.

How do I calm myself down when I‚Äôm in a difficult situation and can‚Äôt leave to calm but still need to in order to solve it?? For example my son is extremely clingy. When he is fighting bedtime he will scream and shriek and flail around. It sets off my fight or flight and I can‚Äôt leave that situation until he is asleep. If I try he will follow me or climb on me so I can‚Äôt get up. I don‚Äôt know how to be calm in that situation and I end up yelling at him. Sometime I‚Äôm just barely holding myself back from slipping into the generational trauma cycle.

Hi there, you can check out [Emotionaid](https://emotionaid.tabs.design/). It's a set of somatic techniques that can help you regulate your nervous system. :) Another technique that can help you with dysregulation as well as releasing your anger is a technique called the [Daily Practice by Crappy Childhood Fairy](https://courses.crappychildhoodfairy.com/daily-practice).  It's something that you can do everyday to help your emotions and nervous system get settled before you start your day. I know in the course that she recommends you do it twice a day and you could, but if you're too busy, being a mom and all, you can start with doing it once a day and see what works for you. :)	breezeboo	reply	na	na	na	0.9950196743011475	weak	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"Hey everyone,

Well as the title says - it was a long time ago and I can't just drop it, accept it and move on. I'm aware of what happened, it hurts. Something that bothers me much is like my ego is hurt here by - how the hell did THEY bullied me when it was supposed to be vice versa? I can't accept the fact that I was the one who was rejected and isolated, that other kids did that to me. I'm stuck now in the past and don't live my life. For the past couple of years I'm aware of some sort of dissociation that has devoured me. I would like to let go and move. So far haven't find much resources on this exact problem. Most trauma related tools are about PTSD, rape, abuse etc. not exactly this.

"Rather than a weighted blanket, I use multiple heavy blankets and comforters - same result. (My ex called it The Big Flat Hug).  The dogs would spill the innards of a weighted blanket in 2 seconds flat, unfortunately, bc they like to dig ""nests"" in the blankets.


I also like to wrap up in a soft blanket. 


I also get a lot of comfort from hugging a stuffie against my heart - the pressure against my heart has a powerful effect. If I need to do something stressful in public, like drs appts, I tuck a small stuffie in my backpack. Nobody needs to know it's there, but I can reach in and touch its softness and know it's there.

So, When I was younger, my mom would always talk trash about my father, saying he was a deadbeat and a horrible parent, but no matter what happened, my dad always made an effort to be in my life when my mother didn't. When I was 11, my mom moved to Texas, and since she had custody of me, I had to go with her. 2 of the worst years of my life ensued because my mother was abusing prescription drugs like Xanax and other painkillers. She doesn't even remember (or acts like she doesn't) all the abuse she put me through in texas. One example is her telling me she wishes she had aborted me. We moved to Washington after those 2 years, and I didn't want to move every few years so when I visited California for summer to see my dad, I asked him to get custody of me. Since my mom didn't bother to show up to 3 of the 4 court dates, my dad got sole custody of me (even if she did show up she would've lost because I told the judge about all the crap she did to me when I lived with her) my dad had gotten much better than he was before I moved (he drank a lot and had an addiction to painkillers.) He passed after about 5 months of me living with him on October 1st 2018 from heart disease and an overdose on the meds he was taking to get rid of his painkiller addiction because my step mother (who he was planning on divorcing) gave him more pills than he was supposed to take. I lived with my grandmother on my mom's side for about a year before moving back in with my mom because my grandmother was somehow even worse than my mom. My mom has gotten much better since then, but once I turned 18, I moved back down to California to live with my grandmother on my dad's side since all of my family members live here I've been living here since July of 2022, and I'm planning on moving to Wyoming with my girlfriend of 4 years next years and my mom is super happy that I'm making decisions for myself. I'm glad she's gotten better and she says she's going to move to Germany in a few years. I have a good relationship with my mom now as well as 2 of my 3 siblings (my dad's kids but not my moms) and I'm glad I at least have them to talk to about these things but I've been thinking about this a lot recently and just wanted to hear some other people's similar stories.

"I‚Äôm currently a 13 y/o male, I don‚Äôt usually do stuff like this, but i‚Äôm on my last straw. Recently I started speaking with someone which many adults may not be fond of that idea, however she helped me realize I may seriously have a problem on my hands. Most of these stories you will be hearing will be from me from around age 6-8. 

My sister around the age of 11 had proposed the idea of playing dress up. Looking up to her as a ‚Äúcooler‚Äù authority figure I adored the idea. Expecting her to pull out some flashy Ninja Turtle clothes or a Cool double sided cape I sat patiently. She pulled out an Elsa Tutu and a towel (which was supposed to resemble a wig) and she tied my shirt up to reveal my stomach. This had gone on for a few weeks, we would dance and sing but nothing ever felt right about it. My father; bless his heart had caught me and spoke to me about it. I would genuinely question my gender and assume myself gay and effeminate years later, although showing no hate to the LGBTQ+ community. This was not true, as it stands I am straight.

Trigger Warning: Sexual Content

As I would consider my sister a close friend we would hang out often and she would propose ideas that were taboo yet creative. They gave me an awkward feeling in my stomach. On one day my father had been napping downstairs while my mother was working. She had definitely seen porn as she had tried to look it up on my Samsung Tablet. She had asked me to shower with her. She would feel on my body and I decided my gut feeling was too strong and I stepped out and put my pajamas back on. 
 
On another day after school being the ‚Äúfunny‚Äù eight year old I began talking about buttholes thinking it was funny She had asked me to pull my pants down and she had looked at my anus. I laughed for a while but then she had left. I had the same gut feeling.

One day I had been in my bedroom
watching OnyxKids when she had asked me if i wanted to see what a lap dance was  she made me sit on top of her as she shuffled awkwardly in a blue chair. That same gut feeling came back

After showering another day after school my sister had pulled me into her bedroom and dropped a Disney blanket to reveal her naked body she climbed on top of me while my brother stood to the side half dressed awkwardly. He was a year older than me.

If it is too hard for you to talk about it, maybe you can show this post to your therapist? I think you really need their help here.

Is your sister 16-17 now, still a minor? I think she needs help also, and because she is a minor it is up to your parents to get one for her. But don't tell them this by yourself.  Your therapist is a professional, they have training about this, so they will know what to do for sure.

"Oh, friend. You too. I hope you get out of this safely. I wish I could promise you a solution, or to get you out of there. This world can be a brutal and unfair place, but it sounds like you have a lot of kindness within you. 

If you can get a little slip of paper to your therapist, try that if you think you'll be safe after. 



When I was a kid living with my dad, I clung on to a few things to get me to the other side. The biggest by far was books. I spent weeks every summer where I was the first patron in the library and the last out. I know reading isn't everyone's cup of tea, but there's so much beauty to be found that no other media can offer. Poetry and fantasy and stories of triumph. People have always been the same, and words of comfort transcend time. The best part, though? It has made my adult life SO much easier. 

Beauty is what got me through, and it's always what I cling to. 

Take care of yourself, even if no one else will. Remind yourself that this too shall pass, as all things must. Study diligently, or look for a career center opportunity so you can leave your home as soon as possible. Feel no guilt when that time comes: those whose purpose was to protect you failed. From experience, trust and believe that the escape of drugs and alcohol will only weigh you down when it's time to fly because that shit costs money and self-reliance is goddamn priceless.

Hi. 11 month ago, me, my family and my friends went through a very traumatic experience. I can't share any details because of the ongoing investigation but I need help. I can't get over it. We lost people during this experience, now I can't bear the thought of losing someone, it makes me sick to my core. And being so close to death makes me literally throw up when I think too long about it. My friend recommended the fire by fire method, and I've been watching a show that is about what we experienced, tho it hits too close to home. I've been on seresta and lots of other meds since, I became addicted to them and a month ago was able to stop taking them. I don't know how to deal with life anymore. I'm scared I guess and physically numb. I have a psychiatrist and psychologist but I physically can't talk about my feelings without an anger burst or changing subject suddenly. It's pretty fueled up what happened, it fucks with my head, even when I'm sleeping I have nightmares about it.  I need advice and help.	starsnddiamonds	post	24.616071813095573	female	White	0.9686786532402039	na	na	na	4	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

This is just the first suggestion and might not be the strongest. Firstly, am so sorry to hear that you went through this. It sounds incredibly hard. If you can‚Äôt talk about feelings, have you tried expressing through non verbal channels like art, music, movement? Also, know that your body might not be ready to let you experience talking yet. The brain and vagus do a brilliant job on protection. You might be frozen until your body feels safe enough to unfreeze and that is about the primary nervous system, the lizard brain that is all about survival. Things like talking evolved much later and are on the nervous system that sits closer to the surface. Still helpful to talk if you can, but please give yourself grace and kindness if you can‚Äôt. The survival brain is a product of a lot of previous ancestral survivals and has a point. You also said that you don‚Äôt know how to deal with life. Maybe pick up some literature on this, like the book The Body knows the Score. Has good ideas and stories. Also set simple achievable goals and tick them off. Like drinking water or maybe going for a walk. Think that you are now in charge of the scared part of you and it‚Äôs your responsibility to care for that part, to listen to it and support it. You might also reach out to local or national services aimed at survivors. Hope some of this helped. What ever it was should not have happened and should not have been allowed. It‚Äôs okay to be beyond yourself when it did.	starsnddiamonds	reply	na	na	na	0.9686786532402039	strong	no	strong	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

Thank you for all of your advice it helps honestly. I'll take my time I think but this issue gotta be fixed for the summer, if I explain why, I'd be giving too much information but try and guess what people usually do in the summer and you'd understand maybe. So yeah I hope I will be a bit better by August, anyway thank you so much	starsnddiamonds	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9686786532402039	weak	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

I am now focusing, finally, on healing ptsd, and now I see it has affected everything over time. It's now time to change habits, and slowly replace old energy and memories with new positivity. I'm not too sure what to call this post, I just wanted to share.	snowy108	post	55.461799378537904	female	White	0.0023073633201420307	na	na	na	2	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"**TW: violent sex, dubious consent, panic attacks, dissociation, intrusive thoughts, self harm**

&#x200B;

I struggle with intimacy. Not the mechanics of it, not anymore, but with feeling it. I'm 21 now and coming to terms with the fact that I am unsure, traumatized, and often dissociated in intimate situations.

As a preteen I began to experience intrusive sexual and romantic thoughts. I had sex dreams about any and everyone I interacted with. I became paranoid and somewhat touch repulsed. 

In high school I got on various medications for social anxiety, landing on Zoloft, of which I've been taking 200mg (the highest legal dose in my area) for the better half of a decade now. 

This helped. Immensely. I was able to leave the house without hyperventilating.

The dreams toned down a bit, and didn't leave me feeling as disturbed throughout the day. My severe social anxiety eased and I managed to attend a small alternative school and make a lot of friends, most of which were autistic like me. 

Some of these friends trained me to enjoy touch. One particular friend I made around this time taught me to be comfortable changing clothes and even showering with her, and at some point I considered myself pretty thoroughly desensitized to my own body, and to platonic affection with those around me. 

But alas, we were all horny teens, and so non platonic touching was rather inevitable.

The first issues were kissing and holding hands.

My first teen kisses were with friends. Nobody I was especially attracted to, just people I was comfortable hugging and eventually tried kissing. I would also hold their hands. And in the moment I'd be fine, I think. Or I'd think I was fine. Something like that. The Zoloft fogs my mind and dims my alertness most of the time, even now.

The trouble wouldn't start until it was over. I'd scratch my palms raw, pull the skin off my lips, festering repulsion at the contact I'd had with someone else. I felt disgusting. 

But then I found sex.

Sex didn't start out for me like it did for most teens. My first sexual relationship was unspoken and undefined. A friend of a friend who was sensitive and liked me to pull their hair until they came in their pants. It wasn't proper bdsm etiquette, I know that now, but we'd communicated just enough to know it was consensual and enjoyable all around. That was my first taste of sex.

Then I got a crush. A big crush. My first big crush since the age of 10.

He was also a friend of a friend. He was two years older, experienced, and kinky. Smart and pretty and terrifying. I wanted him. And I was scared of him. I was unfamiliar with the feeling of real attraction. It was intense.

And it turns out he was interested in me, too. 

It took two years of panic attacks and semi nonverbal cuddling for me to sleep with him. He was patient. Sweet. A brand new experience. The sex was violent from the beginning. I was happy with that. We both were. He'd leave me bruised and cut and worn out and I'd take pictures in the shower at home of my beautiful marks. I don't remember him asking to hurt me, but maybe he did. Maybe we talked about it at some point in the year leading up to it. I'm sure hints were dropped that we both wanted it.

We started dating shortly after we started fucking, and had our first kiss shortly after that. He asked me for kissing. I hadn't even thought of it. I still didn't especially enjoy it, but I didn't really love any of it in the moment I don't think. I never felt totally present during sex or cuddling, not unless my hair was being nearly torn out and my cervix bruised. Then I was at least present in the pain, which forced pleasure through me as it rampaged me.

He was polyamorous and I wasn't, so we settled on a grey zone in the middle, with open communication about attraction to others but a need for discussion if we were to act on it.

I told him I was scared of him, and it was true, but I didn't mean it like a bad thing. My body was scared of him. Hyperventilating on my way to his parents house, vomiting on the side of the road before our first time (I popped a breath mint and we didn't kiss). But I loved him.

I stopped hanging out with some of my friends. Stopped playing Halo and tabletop roleplay with my closest friends after school each week. Didn't even notice when one of my friends was kicked out of the school. I changed. It was like he was the only thing that mattered. Him and our mutual friends.

When covid hit I was in my senior year. He'd graduated a while back, and was living in a moldy hoarders house with a young couple, several pets, and a back bedroom with frequent new roommates. 

My emotionally abusive mother kicked me out in June of 2020, just after I turned 18. I moved in with him.

The first month or two were great. It was a high after being trapped with my mother for months. The roommates were wonderful friends, food stamps covered enough food for me to gain a bit of weight finally, and my partner was nice to be around for the most part. And then it went to shit.

Of course, there had been red flags before then. He bit partway through my friends finger one time in a moment of rage after saying he didn't want to be touched. He would talk about how he felt urges to kill when he's angered. I watched him kick a small puppy across a kitchen because it was begging at his feet. One time he put me in a chokehold and knocked me out within five seconds, only to apologize, cuddle me for a bit, then take me to a restaurant he liked (made me try food I didn't like or want) and had me bus home alone and dissociated. And when we started living together I'd have to call his mom for advice on how to help him when he became nonverbal and suicidal. I'd listen to him tell me how he liked knowing he could do anything to me when we were having sex and I wouldn't be able to stop him. I stopped enjoying sex altogether. It was just a need of his that I provided help with. I'd lay there staring at the ceiling, pretending to moan, thinking about what he would say if I told him to stop. He would stop, but then what? Get distressed and confused? Go to someone else as he told me often he wanted to?

I didn't know what normal was. I didn't know he and I weren't healthy.

He eventually fell in love with one of our roommates (call them A). The couple we lived with were in an open relationship, and even though we weren't really at the time, they started having erotic wrestling matches in the living room and holing away together in a bedroom to talk for hours. 

Our other roommate (B) and I were worried. We saw them bonding over similar violent fantasies and struggles, things that A had confronted and gotten through long ago, only to be brought back up now into my partners waiting grasp.

When my partner told me he wanted more with A it wasn't surprising. I knew the situation. I knew they were only going to get closer, no matter what I said, so I told them they could fuck.

I hurt myself that night. Scratched open my hand and nearly blacked out with panic. A couldn't look me in the eye after that.

We separated and I moved out shortly after. Stayed with my close friend from high school, the one who taught me confidence. And I felt like a whole new person. My now-ex had encouraged me to fool around with others during our relationship, but I hadn't much wanted to. I had held on obsessively to the comfort I got from him once the fear faded with time. Now I was free. I wasn't mothering a partner. I was just living for me.

A year or so later I went to see a professional dominatrix. It didn't do much for me. My ex hadn't either, not unless he was breaking me apart with his teeth or a knife, but it was different realizing not even a professional would be able to satisfy me. I dissociated during our session and she stopped, pet my hair, and told me stories instead. She told me she's autistic too, and I had a good time with her. But it wasn't because of the pleasure. The pleasure was there, sure, but I didn't cum. I've only ever made myself orgasm. I just start feeling disgusting after a while when others try. Like a teenager peeling skin off to get rid of the feeling of a kiss.

This year I've dipped my toes back into sex. There's a lovely person in my city who I meet with a few times a month. We hang out, cuddle, watch horror movies, and I dominate her. It's enjoyable. It makes me feel good. But I'm still in this constant fog. I want to do more to her, with her, with plenty of people probably, but as soon as I hold someone, or vice versa, the world goes fuzzy and I don't Feel the moment until hours or days later. 

I just started spending time with a friend who's interested in me sexually and somewhat romantically. I have been open about some of my struggles but am also potentially interested in a friends with benefits situation. We spent last night together. We kissed, which I've come to not mind, even slightly enjoy, if only for the reactions it warrants in the other person. We left hickeys on each other. Were rather gentle and caring. It felt odd. Like I was somebody else. Brain too fuzzy to even vocalize at my usual rate. Today the hickeys are staring me down. They remind me of my ex. Make me feel like gagging if I think about them too hard. Feel like I'm 16, showing off my bruises on a bus full of people all over again. 

So I sit here typing all this out, not for any particular reason, but because I just don't understand. Don't understand why I can't enjoy these things like a normal person. Why I can't feel happy when being held. Why my body feels alien under others fingertips. 

I loved rough sex. I needed it. But now I don't know if I should look for it. If I'll like it the same way when I'm pinned under some other body. 

And why can't I have a coherent fucking thought?

I want to experience myself and my sexual partners to their full potentials, but I start shutting down too quickly. 

I have an emergency therapy appointment in an hour. I'll vent to her too. Maybe read her this if I can muster up the energy. My throat feels like it does when I vomit, turning out on itself. My head foggy. It was probably hard to write this. I wouldn't know, I've barely been present."

"read it because of the title. how do you think autism ties into the traumatic events? is it only that particular ex that had autism? i am sorry how badly that affected you. 

i have autism and im familiar with some of the struggles. hyper- and hypo-sensitivity are common problems. for me it is the opposite, im too sensitive, so i wouldnt be interested in rough sex or put myself in that situation. however, the autism runs in our family and often manifests as addiction to alcohol or whatever numbs out the sensitivity. i guess its lucky none of us turned to sex to deal with the sensory issues as it hurts others and compounds problems. 

sorry to go off on a tangent and not be able to relate much. the physicality of things is tricky, as much as we want to be fully present, it also hurts to do so because theres so much trauma attached. maybe theres a hint there about the sensory aspect. if you can find sensory things you enjoy that arent sexual or triggering, that might help."

"Thank you for the comment. 

I am autistic and it causes sensory issues and misunderstandings of social situations that manifest in intrusive thoughts and paranoia when left to fester. I am also hypersensitive to some sensory input but hyposensitive to pain and sexual pleasure, which causes me to go for very specific and sometimes painful things. 

My ex isn‚Äôt diagnosed with autism but has some other diagnoses that make him neurodivergent. 

I‚Äôd love to find more enjoyable sensory experiences that might help me become more present in sex again.

"how you said in your post that you ""need"" rough sex sounds like its a kind of addiction as well as a trauma and neurodiversity issue. very curious about how a professional would work around that. and since the social aspect is also difficult because of autism, i suspect some had been taking advantage too. you might have felt safe with people who later on proved to be unsafe.

"So this is a weird crazy story/summary of life this far. I (28M) feel like I have been living my life with an absurd amount of masking. I set out on a spiritual awakening journey when I was 18 and started college, the first time I had ever been truly alone and truly started feeling that deep sense of loneliness. Which is what kicked in my spiritual awakening, by asking questions about who I was, why was I here and why did I have such a deep unexplainable yearning for ""home"" which was not ""physically"" attainable. Not a yearning for home in the sense of being with my family, but a deep, deep cry out from what I felt was my soul essence. 

Fast forward through some heavy years of partying, clubbing/going to shows, drugs and alcohol. At 23, I met who is now my wife and the mother of my/our amazing daughter and through the 5 years we've been going through this human experience together, we both got a lot deeper and a lot more ""serious"" about expanding and opening up our spiritual bodies. We were kind of forced into delving DEEP into it because our first true ""interactions/dates"" were so deeply rooted in spirit that we (very fortunately) discovered/realized that we are cut off the same soul cloth and are infact soulmates/twin flames or whatever floats your boat for descriptions regarding life partners. 

We have learned and discovered a lot about ourselves as well as a newly found perception of the outter world (largely influenced emotionally, spiritually, mentally by Ram Dass, Jack Kornfield, Dale RamDev. . . Spiritual Adepts/teachers, guides etc.) 
This absolutely transformed a lot of our inner and outer world (through disciplined routines and practices) for the better in a very beautiful way. Then in 2021 we moved to Idaho on an instinctual as well as an impulse decsion to be closer to my wife's side of the family out there, and our intuitive feeling of needing to go to the northwest part of the country. 
When we got there we were almost instantly met with extreme adversity and complications with my wife's health, our marriage, and life as a whole. So needless to say it was not the ""change"" we had in mind. Though we now see it all as the change/step that was necessary for self discovery and growth personally,  together and as a while family unit. 
In late 2021 I was waiting for an orientation class for a new job and had to wait until the next class (2 weeks out) so while waiting two weeks, we needed money to eat and keep life running so I decided since I had a drill and basic tools I'd to do some side work/odd jobs (honey do list kind of things)  to bring in whatever cash I could. This ended up blowing up in a beautiful way and I ended up quitting that new job on orientation day to set off and fully jump into the possible opportunity of working for myself. Now almost 2 years later and I'm still doing my own thing (bathroom remodels, tile, carpentry and flooring) and it's been amazing. 

We also recently moved back home to Colorado and since we've been back it's been a struggle for a miriad of reasons, but the one struggle that I've found myself dealing with the most and is the heaviest emotion, is my own personal sense of validation. 
I actually just (today) realized that I have been chasing external validation for as long as I can remember (about 3-4 years old) 
While thinking about the current slump that I'm in I started thinking about what makes me ""feel okay/feel like me"" and most of those things are (now) related to my work. Building things for people, fixing things, repairs, custom furniture, etc. And then being validated by a ""good job, we are so happy!"" Kind of thing from my clients. 
Thinking further back before this and it's all been an ongoing search for validation through my external world. 
My party phase, the validation came from my knowledge of drugs, artists, previous party stories and a whole bunch of unhealthy methods and vices. 
Before that, through the beginnings of highschool getting into heavy drug use (psychedelics, weed and cocaine/stimulants) and partying I was a hardcore WoW gamer (big time raider in a progressive guild that sought to be the best in the game) and always sought out to be the best in my guild (for whatever role character I was playing). Seeking validation through being the best gamer. 
Before that I was obsessed with skateboarding, from age 9-16 or 17 I would strive to be the best skater in my school, at the skate park (within reason) and from my parents. I was small town sponsored (nothing really fancy, just discounted apparel/gear and occasionally a free board) 
And before that, but also mixed in through the years until about 20, I was huge on drawing mythical/fantasy creatures and characters and was pretty damn good. 
But looking back at all the ""phase of interest transitions"" I see one common goal. External validation through an attempt to prove myself in an outward expression/skill. 

I was also looking back at the overall ""emotional neglect"" that I got from my parents (mom and step dad, bio dad left the picture when I was about 1, 1/2 ) 
And not to say that they were absolute assholes or anything like that, but they were very young (I was 2 and my mom was 18 when she met my step dad) and learning life for themselves. So I know that they didn't ""intentionally"" emotionally neglect me or invalidate me. But I wasn't good at the things they wanted me to do (playing tee ball/baseball as a toddler/young kid) because my step dad was a huge baseball guy. And because I wasn't into or good at the things they wanted to see me do, I found my own interests, independently and amongst my friend group. However this caused parental tension because I was (in their eyes) becoming a hoodlum. 
Never got the acknowledgement or 'parental praise and proudness' from skating, drawing, playing WoW (step dad played too), obviously not for partying and doing drugs, but not even now. Not even as a 28 year old married man running my own business and father to a beautiful 3 year old daughter. 
Most of my side of the family disagrees with ""entrepreneurship/self employment"" because it isn't as ""stable"" as a corporate box job. - According to them, even though they've all been laid off at some point or another from corporations that are ""never going anywhere, we have job security for life"". 

Sorry, tangent rants aside! I am now facing an immense amount of emotional pain/flashbacks for the lack of validation I have within myself. 
I am able to see and recognize the immense amount of growth I've undergone and the fact that I didn't die from drugs and partying and pushed through all of that to get where I am now. And I see that I have a shit ton to validate my own worth, I understand the growth that I've undergone and will continue to go through, but I absolutely struggle with giving myself credit, feeling okay with where I am. I can't help but feel like I'm not doing enough and always feel like there is something to do. 

This morning I recognized that as an issue of control, and when I don't have the ability to control my volume/standard of output with ""things to show"" whether it be through work, hobby projects or anything else where I can do/build/repair something for someone. I get extremely depressed. And only really feel 'okay' when I'm doing things. 
I see this as a  trauma wound that has deepend through my years and has gone essentially completely unacknowledged within myself. Until our TRUE spiritual journey began 5 years ago. 
I do not want to be mentally controlled or enslaved to the inner ego narrative that I'm not doing enough, but I have no idea how to truly accept myself. Accept who I was, who I am and who I'm becoming. I feel like I've just gotten so good at distracting myself by staying busy and constantly seeking validation through helping others that I have no idea who I actually am. I feel like I've been living the biggest lie ever and I've deceived everyone in my life but mostly myself. 
When I truly sit and think about what I truly enjoy for myself, I can't think of anything. Aside from the cliche of 'being with my family' (wife and daughter) which does truly bring me happiness. But I can't live in or hold on to ""those moments"" forever. 
And outside of them, or doing something for someone to give me that pat on the back, I do not have a damn clue who I am. 

And I know that who I am is a culmination of everything I've done and am becoming. But that's still only validated through the external. And I know ram Dass would tell me to just let go and release the inner narrative to what is and just be in/of loving awareness. But, he too struggled with identity. Struggled with feeling like a phony and seeking external validation through experiences or services. 

So if you made it this far, and have either evolved passed this state/level of emotional consciousness and awareness or you too are feeling the same. I'd love some tips, tricks suggestions or anything for how to help get through this obstacle of the human experience. 


And because it was pretty long, and I jump around in here, if there's anything anyone wants further detail or clarification on, I'd be more than happy to attempt to fumble a rambling story again."

"I don't know how to help. I am in the situation that although i seek exteral validation and praise, when it comes I do not believe it, and feel like i need to do better.

I realized that I have been a people pleaser my whole life and apparently that may stem from parents being mentally absent from my life, either because they were drunk, overworked and didn't want to spend time with kids, or both. One of them constantly promising to change and another telling me to leave her alone. Or when i did something, like chores, they were not good enough. Both taking care of family financially, never had been poor... 

So I thought this is normal growing up. Only to find out late in my twenties that it has been traumatic experience that has been shaping my life.

I had been very good at school and always reaching higher. I didn't even had many friends, i was studying all the time. As if i thought that if i get better results i would be a better child and they would spend more time with me. When i was about ten they asked me what i want for birthday or Christmas...my answer was, i want you to stop drinking. And that continued until i left home to go study to different country.

Only now i started to seek help and read about other people's experiences, and this is because i realized that I do not have only high expectations from myself, i expect that from people around me too. The more I read, the more shit is coming up from my childhood. It's scary to face it and dig deep to find all the causes and triggers, but i think it is the only way (for me) to start improving my life. 

My aim is to write all those things that could have been traumatic and see if i can find some online resources to help me first to find connections and then get through it. Only then if it doesn't work, i would seek specialized therapist.

I talked to a psychologist who not only confirmed adhd but also identified childhood trauma and was very suggestive of therapy with someone who specialises in trauma. I didn't want to get into therapy, as last time in therapy for depression for a year, it made no effect, no change and the therapist wasn't even able to detect my trauma or adhd symptoms. Hence, i would go with self help first. You are the only one who understands yourself the best."	Zykor27	reply	na	na	na	0.002451883861795068	no	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

And i am like, well this is quite normal in place where i grew up, so i didn't consider it that bad. Only now when I started to dig into it i realised that so much of my fears, trust issues and any other behaviour is actually based on that trauma. I guess that's the first step to realise. 

Would be interesting to hear your and ur wife's stories. 
I have read ur other post or comment and i am so sorry that ur life is affected so much. 

One thing at the moment which is helping me is identifying the issues - and for that i have been watching videos by Crappy Childhood Fairy. I was able to make some connections between the current behaviour and past issues/trauma."	Zykor27	reply	na	na	na	0.002451883861795068	weak	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"When i was younger i was showed a rather inappropriate amount of attention and love from my dad, my mother left so he was all i had and i knew no different. He sort of dumped his problems on me, things that a child shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about. My dad wasn‚Äôt over protective, He seemed more jealous than caring/protective, 

EG. i‚Äôm a female and had some run ins with boys my age bullying etc but he‚Äôd never get involved even when i‚Äôd get hit. he made me deal with it myself, but if i have a boy in my life a partner as such he tries to talk down and say it‚Äôll never work out, and gets more involved than ever, he even told me straight up to my face that he‚Äôs jealous when my partners over, which made me feel so uncomfortable..

I love being intimate and affectionate with my partner but sometimes i feel overwhelmed, but when my dad hugs and kisses me (im 18) i feel like i can‚Äôt breathe, He doesn‚Äôt live for himself, his life revolves around me, im in the midst of moving out and getting my own place but he‚Äôs talking about renovating his house to MY liking, Not to his, he doesn‚Äôt want a partner and he‚Äôs just alone and brings me down with him. ofcourse i feel bad that he can‚Äôt get a partner but it‚Äôs his own fault he‚Äôs very narcissistic and once again overwhelming. 
it‚Äôs constant cuddling and kissing on cheeks i just cannot deal and it‚Äôs always been this way.. he also baby talks me and acts as if i‚Äôm incompetent, im very smart and capable but i get treated like a baby. i‚Äôve talked about it but he shuts says you‚Äôll always be a baby too me. 

Any advice? it causes me problems with my partner since he‚Äôs very loving and affectionate and i just sometimes cannot deal."	niobeeeeeeeee	post	22.53550305086231	male	White	0.9983890056610107	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	ethnicity: no prediction, age: 18, gender: female, explanation: the author self-identifies as a female and mentions that she is 18 years old. there is no specific cultural or ethnic context given in the provided text.

"I've recently learned that one largely misunderstood trauma response is a sense of foreshortened future. I have always felt that I wasn't meant for long on this earth and learning this is something that comes with C-PTSD and childhood trauma is absolutely eye opening. For a long time, I thought it was linked to SI, but I am once again overwhelmed with a sudden window to understanding to the intricate parts of me. 

Can we discuss this?

"Hypervigilance, that feeling of holding your breath waiting for the Next Bad Thing to happen, also happens to soldiers on the front line. They have to stay in a state of readiness to protect their lives.


From a child's limited perspective, they also feel as if they are trying protect their own lives, in a sense.


And when you stay in that state for too long, particularly if it is when your brain and nervous system are still developing, it gets ""baked in to the system"".


I hate it. It interferes with so many things: my ability to relax, to perceive safety, to picture a future, to make plans for the future to execute now, etc.

"You‚Äôre going to want to develop the ability to acknowledge the impulse. At first it‚Äôs like the drive is just irresistible, magnetic, even. Which makes it seem impossible to have control over. See if you‚Äôre able to sit and acknowledge that intense drive, even for 10seconds.

Other thing (IMO) is being able to acknowledge and show compassion for the part of you that is driven to do these things. This is a part that feels a strong need to take actions to keep you safe. Hating and resisting fuels it.

I only just found out this isn't normal and I'm not sure what it's called so I can find out more about it. I was making out with my bf yesterday and I wasn't comfortable with something he wanted to try. We didn't do it, obviously, but we were talking about why I wasn't comfortable with it and I referenced how I saw it from the outside. It's like I have a camera view from the other side of the room looking on and my perspective bounces between where I actually am and that other camera view. I always have this unless I'm completely alone or sometimes when my chronic pain kicks in badly enough that I lose the ability to feel self-conscious or see myself from the outside. Even in my memories, I'm usually seeing the scene from the outside more than from my own perspective. I could even point to where in the room my other perspective was standing. Does anyone else experience this? I didn't realize that wasn't normal, but it explains so much of why I'm often overwhelmed and struggle to process everything. What is it called, and where can I find out more about it?	Minute-Dimension-629	post	26.764083886508562	female	White	0.008341333828866482	na	na	na	4	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"This sounds kind of related to ""depersonalization"", which you might do low grade chronically in some way? It's not obviously the same though.

For me, depersonalization was one time when I got shit sleep for a week straight, by the end of it I felt like I was watching my body go through the motions from a camera in my head.

I also had an ex who would experience himself in third person quite often, especially any time in his imagination, and I think it was a kind of dissociation for him too.

Is your therapist experienced with dissociation?? That‚Äôs definitely a requirement if you have lost memories.

"Not someone lying to you, but you lying to them? Growing up I noticed that pretty much anything I said went unnoticed and soon learned that if I just lied a little, spiced up the story they would pay a lot more attention. Now the habit is stuck with me..

I‚Äôve realized I don‚Äôt lie to strangers but the more closer the person is to me, the more I lie = I lie to my fianc√© daily. 

It‚Äôs not big things, for example just something someone said at work or something that happened in the traffic or at grocery store. Basically that basic everyday life. 

My fianc√© is amazing, I‚Äôve told him about this issue and he is so supportive and said that he won‚Äôt mind at all if after few minutes I confess that part of it was a lie. That all that matters is that I‚Äôm honest to myself and try to unlearn this habit. He knows I‚Äôll be honest when it comes to serious things, I know it too.

So how do I unlearn this? I can‚Äôt bring myself to confess to my fianc√© that I‚Äôve lied about stuff I just told. I guess that trauma in me fears he‚Äôll react like my parents, get furious, not care anymore cause then the story is boring without the spice/extra drama."		post	12.682259075812215	male	White	0.014568278566002846	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

" I am 23 years old and have moved around a lot. I currently would say I have two ""real life"" friends and maybe 1 or 2 internet friends and my boyfriend. Those real life friends I have known since 4th grade and probably only catch up once every three to six months (they are both hundreds of miles away now). Other than that I really have no outside communication except my bf who i see almost every day. The problem is that I literally don't know how to be alone and the days I'm not with my boyfriend, I don't know what to do with myself, especially since I've been going through some really unforeseen changes and feel like my stability has been thrown off. I will literally dissociate into tiktok for 4 hours and feel like shit or stare at the wall or just go to sleep. ""Just do something you enjoy"" I don't feel like I enjoy anything when I'm alone. Food tastes bland and art is boring and tv and movies dont capture me at all. Even the things I enjoy doing with my boyfriend are so insanely boring when Im alone. I grew up with an identical twin and since we moved apart at 15 I have been in 3 different long term relationships, aka I have never been alone. I dont enjoy that I am this way and yes I have been in therapy for a combined 6 years, but I have a lot of others things Ive worked on with my therapists. I literally dont know where to begin to fix this and cannot currently afford a therapist. It feels like my happy chemicals just dont engage without another person present. It makes me feel like a leach that when my bf is busy I'm essentially waiting for him to be free or waiting until I go into work again. I work two jobs because I literally dont know what to do with myself when I am alone. Even when I want to do things (i.e. I wanted to get a foot massage this week bc I just started waitressing again and my feet are hurting every day) I will not go do it without my bf and will go so far as to pay for his portion just so i dont have to go alone (so that i can actually enjoy it.) I know this is probably some weird trauma that I dont understand but I feel like its a pretty serious issue that I need to fix. One, I just wanted to ""say"" this to another person because I don't think I have and two, I would love advice or even just knowing that another person suffers w this. 

TLDR: Idk how to enjoy anything when I'm alone and it seriously is affecting my adult life. Any advice or relating to this?"	peytxngrxce	post	23.667545253300712	female	White	0.9963634610176086	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"I (21, nb) started dating someone very recently, a week ago. But we've already been on three dates and we text every day, which is nice. But I find myself asking ""why does he like me?"" Or waiting for things to go wrong. I take hours to respond to his text messages, even though I'm thinking about him and want to reply. And I just found myself dissociating while I was trying to text him back. It's strange, because he's very nice and very easy to get along with. Were able to have good conversations and we agree on a lot of things that are important to me.  But I have this problem with dating where I find myself doing things like this.. getting almost unreasonably anxious, dissociating, waiting for things to go wrong, trying to ""ick"" myself out so I can end it and escape. I don't know why I'm doing this. I'm getting frustrated that he likes me, I'm like he doesn't know enough about me. He has no business liking me this much. Which seems silly, but I don't know how to sort through these feelings

For more context, I've had some trauma related to relationships in the past.

do you feel worthy of being seen for who you are? do you feel worthy of being loved unconditionally? do you feel worthy of having people who see all aspects of yourself and still CHOOSE to stay with you (friendships, romantic relationships..).

She wasn't around as well as the ex and my bag sitting outside the door with a feeling between my legs. With me having no memory I thought she had work to go to. The guy drops me off and the next day I go to work and see her there with her friend (I work in bar). 
Anne explains to me she was scared to talk to me cause she cried feeling guilty for leaving me there and what happened. I, of course asked, her cause I needed to fill the blanks and let her know I couldn't remember anything after the game. 
She tells me I went to his bed wanting to take nap when I did they would check up on me. I would ask her to sleep next to me cause I didn't want to sleep next to the guy. She offered that we sleep on the couch so we don't kick him out of his own bed. He says we can sleep in the bed if he sleep there with us too. Of course that wasn't going to happen she wouldn't leave me alone or without her so she also says we can just leave to whick he tells her to take me and f off out of his house. She collects my bag and goes to get me and if anyone knows me knows that nothing will stop me from sleeping. I wanted to sleep more so she practically dragged me to leave explaining I was pretty much dead weight in my state (I think her ex was gone by this point for work). Once we got to the door which has stairs I struggled to get out of her grip and she lost her grip on me and I fall on the stairs. Luckily it was just a bump on the head but she cried saying she didn't mean it and me telling her to f off and went back to pass out. 
The guy closed the door and wouldn't let her back in even when she tried to get my bag back to me. She asked security of the complex if they could help with the bag and was afraid something would happen to me cause he wasn't answering her anymore. He wouldn't even open for security so Anne left my bag outside and she had to go home eventually.
She told me she called our friend, Kevin crying worried about me and felt extremely guilty. I made sure to let her know it wasn't her fault and that she shouldnt feel guilty that it was mine for being so stubborn. Anne asked if something did happen or if I felt anything physically. I told her no. I don't want her to feel any more guilty than she already does. 
I know I got spiked and I know something happened. I have a tiny little flash and I know what I felt between my legs. Its not great knowing I was taken advantage of while incapacitated. 
Its been four days and I don't know how to feel emotionally. I can't cry even though I'm an emotional person. I'm not happy. I can't focus. I don't know if it's even sunk in yet. Is it normal to feel like this? What do I do? I haven't told anyone except Kevin and one other friend"	PlaceNameHere08	post	20.124414369768832	female	White	0.9969769716262817	na	na	na	5	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"It‚Äôs completely normal do feel well, anyway after a traumatic event. What you‚Äôre describing feeling makes complete sense. Talking about it and getting support from people you trust  right  now is incredibly important; it is a big factor in reducing the likelihood of long term ptsd and it‚Äôs just good for you. The same as if you like physically got hurt; people would come over and you‚Äôd get help from them. So now that you‚Äôve gone through a trauma, even if you‚Äôre not physically hurt, you are emotionally hurt, and it‚Äôs better not to go through it alone. 

So please- be kind to yourself. Give yourself space to de-stress and space to feel. I know you may want to but when feelings come up it may be better not to push them down and handle them in a safe way.

I also suggest a therapist who specializes in sexual violence or trauma if you feel like you are having a tough time. Another possible help could be a support group. Your local domestic violence shelter or rape center or something like that may have groups or may know where some groups are held. there are also other subreddits you may find helpful, like r/rape and r/sexualassault

"I am sorry, he drugged you and raped you. 

Go to hospital ASAP, they will test you for the spiking drugs and check if you were sexually assaulted. And do a rape kit if it is not too late.

You have enough to press charges against this guy. It is not just to get justice, it is also to protect yourself from blackmailing etc. You don't know what happened there.

If you are in US, call RAINN, it is the organization that helps SA victims, they will help you navigate it. I think they also help with legal and therapy stuff for victims. Or look for the same hotline in your country.

The trigger is when a date is going well, and I think the date may be headed towards sex, panic. End the date, abort.

"***apologies, this is my secret account. I don't want my friends to see this. I'm not a bot nor spammer mods, I simply do not wish my friends to see this. to know it's me.*** 

To give context, I'm still in college(23f, stopped when the pandemic hit), in SEA country, and still in the household, I deemed to be unsafe. 

My father is the classic dad who can't provide, has cheated and has a terrible temper which then results in my mom getting hurt or me. I didn't know it was wrong because it was under the guise of ""punishment"" when I was a kid. Till now when he loses his shit he still excuses it as your the daughter in the dad, I have to give discipline or whatever your typical Asians say to establish hierarchy/authority. 

I'm doing my best, as the eldest, to take care of everybody. Mom was hospitalized last year so were still financially recovering it and emotionally. Mom is currently at the hospital looking out for Grandma. So extra chores and errands are up to me, especially since i know how to cook. Its definitely tiring to be aware of abuse or how my needs have not been met WHIlLE experiencing this household. I desperately want to leave, but I can't leave my sister. At least she doesn't get hurt because I'm here. 

My stress of our situation clearly manifests in my eczema, it's driving me nuts and it takes a good chunk of the money I make from commissions(i make art) which is not a lot. I'm carefully deliberating If i can still finish college or just work 

i find my situation quite hopeless, I feel tired. Is there anyone out there who got out of their household? I'd love to hear your stories, I'm hoping it can uplift me to know someone out there has already done it and is now creating a safer environment for themselves."	pursuing-despite12	post	32.75568084936287	female	White	0.9954150915145874	na	na	na	4	traumatoolbox	ethnicity: southeast asian, age: 23, gender: female, explanation: the author self-identifies as a 23 year-old female from a southeast asian country. she talks about typical asian hierarchies and experiences within her family.

As a child my sister would do weird things to me examples of the weird stuff she would do was: forced me to get naked and go on our balcony which looks out onto our street for two seconds because it was a ‚Äúdare‚Äù but then she closed the doors behind me and locked me on the balcony for 5 minutes, she got me to get naked and waited till someone on the street was walking past, she shoved me onto the balcony because our neighbours (a man and his three kids) were walking past they saw me. She was obsessed with my body always draw my ass, make me play these weird games with her that required us to be naked, the one that was fucked up is she was obsessed with my vagina she would look at it a lot and then we made a dance routine for this ad and she got me to show it to my mum, the routine required me to be naked and spread my legs out so you can see it all. I thought it was funny and normal at the time but now that I‚Äôm older it feels weird. She would always get me to do weird things like manipulate me into thinking something was all my fault when I had nothing to do with it an example of this is; she pissed herself when we were playing and made me believe it was my fault so she made me wear her undies which were drenched in urine and skirt home whilst she got to wear my undies and skirt which wasn‚Äôt drenched in urine (for once) on the way home. And there‚Äôs more she‚Äôs done to me but I think I‚Äôve given more than enough examples. It‚Äôs weird we were both young but it just doesn‚Äôt feel right and idk what to think about it. I need help I need advice pls. I am really confused. My parents would never question the things she would do too.

I 34F recently explained my S/A experience that happened to me in my early 20‚Äôs, to a 57M, and his first response was essentially, ‚Äúlogistically that seems hard, how is that even possible‚Äù. I am close to this man and he was telling me about how his 20 some year old daughter was assaulted, and me being empathetic and understanding, I followed up on how she is doing and if there were any charges pending. Somehow the convo turned to my experience and I was baffled when he told me basically, that he didn‚Äôt buy my story. And then has the balls to ask me if we should try that. Are you serious!?? Somebody tells you a trauma and you treat it like a joke? Should have known better because he treats his daughter like a burden, because she moved back in with him and his wife after the assault. I see the way this man is with his sons, and he acts like they are perfect angels(even tho the one some sent his father a picture of his(the sons) wife‚Äôs breasts. I don‚Äôt call what happened to me, more than an assault, because I knew the person and had been in a relationship with him at one point. I feel it takes away from people who were assaulted by strangers. But I know it‚Äôs actually considered more than that. And I still continue to try to get this man to be more empathetic to assault victims, especially when it‚Äôs his OWN daughter. I don‚Äôt dwell on my assault, but the fact that I told someone and they were dismissive about it, really hurt me deeply. I was expecting compassion and kindness, but I knew I should have expected the actual reaction, deep down. Anyways, I just needed to vent this to someone.

"Hi there, I'm sorry for all that you're going through right now. As someone who also had a toxic relationship with my mother I can relate. One thing that helped me was making peace with how she treated me. I can't change people that don't want to change (or don't even realize they need to change), and so I just accepted my mother as she is. It doesn't mean that I was condoning the way she treated me, or thought that I deserved to be treated the way that she's treating me. It's more about realizing that if I keep wishing her to be a different way than she is, then I'll basically be attaching myself to something, an ideal that would just be a source of my own suffering. And doing this can feel like grieving, especially when I realized that I never got the childhood I wanted. But that helps in realizing that what I was looking for, is something I won't find in the present moment and our present relationship. Maybe in the future, when we both heal, but not in that moment. And that can be incredibly freeing. Most of the time, that's where the pain comes from. Every time we interact with our abuser our wounds of abandonment and betrayal get retriggered if we're still looking for the person we wish they could be and it's just a vicious cycle. I decided to accept my mother as she is, and acted accordingly. I would set boundaries and I started to heal and reparent myself (For reparenting, you can check out a book called Self-Parenting by John K. Pollard) and build myself back up. But most importantly I understood that her treatmeant of me wasn't a reflection of me, but a reflection of her own relationship with herself.

I'd like to share a technique with you that helped me process my emotions. It's called the [Daily Practice by Crappy Childhood Fairy.](https://courses.crappychildhoodfairy.com/daily-practice) It helps you express, understand and release your emotions, fears and resentments and also helps your nervous system calm down. If you're spiritual, or even curious and open-minded, you can also try researching about Buddhism, or any spiritual practice or path that speaks to you. In my personal experience, finding something that helps me feel grounded, connected and centered within myself (like a spiritual practice or even a personal practice that means a lot to you if you're not spiritual) creates a foundation for that in my day to day life, and it helps remind me of who I am and what's important to me. That's always a good place to start from when you're healing.

I also found a few videos on narcissistic relationships that you might find helpful. :)

"I keep having dreams from people I was with in elementary school (mind you that was like 18 yrs ago) , it sounds so silly but it mostly has to do with a manipulative female friend. Let me start off by telling you a bit of our backstory: She and I had a very weird on/off friendship in elementary school. She was one of the first people who wanted to meet up with me after school and made it obvious she wanted to be my friend - but her and her best friends idea of friendship was trying to boss me and her sister around and get us to be their little slaves and obey them no matter what. (Later on another former best friend of hers became my best friend and also bullied me lol) I wasn't stupid so I never willingly played into her game but she became even more of a manipulative lying frenemy with time and did things to make me trust her and tell her my secrets, do things with her that turned out to be illegal and then  break my trust by embarassing me in front of my longterm crush Back then and trying to FORCE me to confess to him in a totally inappropriate situation. And then they even ended up being a couple even though he was very obviously crushing on me for years before. She even tried to gaslight me into thinking my family hates me..And so on and so forth. It was pretty much impossible to avoid her and her sociopathic-like behavior. Now fast forward to the last few days of elementary: I was sick for a few days and on the last few days of my sick leave from school I annoyed my mum to let me go out in the park - somehow that girl ended up being there aswell and proceded to turn all my friends, my former crush and even my best friend back then against me when i attended the last day of school. Everyone ignored me and refused to talk to me bc i was ""a liar""?!?!  hahaha idek. Even I think it's ridiculous but apparantly these events have given me some sort of betrayal wound
and I can often see similar patterns in my relationships with other people.

"Your hurt from back then was valid then and still is now. It sounds like a long and disturbing and inescapable campaign of sick behaviour. And that's the definition of Complex PTSD: intolerable inescapable repeating toxic stress.


It's no surprise it left a mark - it sounds awful. I shudder to think what more that girl is capable of now (and what might have been going on in her home).


It doesn't matter how long ago a wound happened, or a series of wounds - what matters is that there weren't sufficient tools and support to process it at the time, so it sits inside, waiting to be processed and addressed.


That's best done in the company of a compassionate caring trauma-informed therapist who can help you work through it and the ripple effects in your current life.

i will try to add info i feel may be relevant

as the title states, i 24f havent really felt ive been getting the right treatment. ive been on and off of many different anti-depressants, antipsychotics and mood stabilizers. 

currently i also suffer from anxiety and cptsd related to going through cancer two years ago. i am in therapy for that and my other issues to work through. i also see my psychiatrist regularly. 

as of lately, ive had daily thoughts or ‚Äúimages‚Äù of hurting people or seeing situations in my head. when these images pop into my head, its like watching a few second movie from the outside. these thoughts are gut wrenching and horrible to me and have begun to interrupt daily function. they induce panic attacks as well. 

currently, i am taking 200mg zoloft and .5mg of lorazepam as needed although it does not provide relief and i find myself taking more. 

these thoughts are very repetitive and terrify me. im having a tough time with disproportionate anger, repetitive thoughts, dissociation, depression to the point where i am not taking care of myself, controlling emotions, paranoia, worthlessness, severe insomnia and just irritated. ive had a lot of those feelings for a while but they seem to be interfering more and more with daily functioning. 

im obviously not asking for a new diagnosis, but a major part of me feels that i was not diagnosed properly and therefore am not on a good regimen for me. i was curious i guess what i could do about this, or if anyone has similar experiences to help me understand this more? 

i have been seriously debating inpatient care as these thoughts dont seem like passing intrusive but iknow i dont want to act on them. my therapist is aware of some of this and has made a safety plan with me.

im not asking to be diagnosed (thats what professionals are for), but i want to open a dialogue with my psychiatrist about this but im anxious."	lil_gh0stf4ce	post	31.957117240755267	female	White	0.9949203133583069	na	na	na	9	traumatoolbox	the post doesn't provide enough information to infer the author's ethnicity. however, the author is likely in their twenties and female, as suggested by the specification '24f' in the post, which typically stands for '24 years old, female'.

additional info that may of may not be relevant: i have a long list of childhood trauma (hence therapy), i constantly feel like i question who ‚Äúme‚Äù really is. i feel i also struggle with lashing out even if there is no apparent danger or reason to. i fond myself hating and loving my partner and friends at the same time. i have a fear of abandonment (childhood trauma). i also notice i am very impulsive.	lil_gh0stf4ce	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9949203133583069	no	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
I think you should ask your therapist to refer you for psychological testing, it can better pin down an accurate diagnosis. Then your psychiatrist could taler medications more appropriately. Diagnosing is more of an art form by mental health professionals, psych and neuropsychological testing is more science based. Best to you, the symptoms you‚Äôre having now are very stressful and maybe you could talk to your pharmacist as well	lil_gh0stf4ce	reply	na	na	na	0.9949203133583069	weak	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"I hear you. If you have CPTSD , the bipolar could just be an inability to regulate emotions due to childhood trauma. 

I also have CPTSD and have been seeing a therapist for it for over 3 years, working darn near full time on it when I'm not working to support myself financially that is. I went through intrusive thoughts for almost two of these years and it was horrifying. 

For me, It ended up being emotional flashbacks that seemed like I was thinking about doing those things to a person, but it was really parts of myself trying to get me to understand that I lived through this with perpetrators doing the same to me. 

Weirdly I went through this postpartum too and had intrusive thoughts about harming my child. It never came to be, and he's a full grown man now. I just pushed through back then, but it was absolutely horrifying to have to work with this emotionally, so I feel every piece of what you're saying. That was obviously years before I even understood my own trauma history fully. I literally just white knuckled it, terrified to tell anybody and so I want to say it is so brave to post here and ask for feedback. 

Not sure if this helps, but I want to give you encouragement to keep trying and seeking what works for you. I ended up going the route of attachment therapy. This has been the right path for me.

"I don‚Äôt know if I have been raped or not. Last night I was high and I was laying in bed and I opened my phone to go on instagram as I was looking at this post all of the sudden I just have this flash back of being penetrated it‚Äôs weird it felt so familiar I all of the sudden just travelled to this moment. I‚Äôve never kissed anyone or had sex before, every time I‚Äôm close to doing something sexual I just become disgusted, I have to stop myself from breaking down and crying and I just want to hide and never be seen again, and I‚Äôve never known why I am like this. Anyways for some reason I just travelled back in time and I was reliving this moment that I had forgotten about and just left my mind, it felt so familiar my body remembered what it felt like I couldn‚Äôt see the persons face but I was in a dark room and my legs were open, and I was positioned at the end of a bed, I remember not really being able to see, the persons hands pushed down on my legs with one hand to stop me from moving and the other on my mouth, I couldn‚Äôt breathe properly they did this initially and then just placed both of their hands on my legs once I stopped trying to fight them off. I literally just re lived this thing that happened to me I completely forgot about what had happened to me it‚Äôs like my brain just pushed it so far back and for some reason this got triggered and I just re lived it all. I snapped out of this realisation, I was so confused and just emotional I was just at a loss and still am as to what to think about this all. I started to realise that the stuff I found weird that my body and myself would do was probably clues and signs of the consequences that this has made on me. As a child I would always wet the bed ever single night I would wet the bed up until I was 14 years old, my parents never seemed medical advice even though my family friends would suggest us too but they never did. My parents would make me not eat sugar or water in the evening as they thought that was the reason but it wasn‚Äôt and of course I would continue to piss myself. I remember when I was young it would burn a lot when I had to pee and I remember telling my parents cause one time it hurt so bad when I went to the toilet that I would cry due to the pain of it. My parents didn‚Äôt do anything about it. I‚Äôve been molested by my dad quite abit he‚Äôs trapped my ass and boobs and when I was in primary school he would always tell me that im a lesbian and that I‚Äôm butch and that it‚Äôs ok to be one. He would always go on about this and it made me feel weird cause I was just a child, and it made me question myself and still has. I still find it weird how he would always try and push this sexuality onto me. I‚Äôve always had bad anxiety too my parents didn‚Äôt and still haven‚Äôt done anything to help me and my mental health. I was also molested by one of my male childhood best friends one time we were hanging outside of my house and we were play fighting he bent me over and held me by the neck and was hitting me from behind as if he was having sex with me and this all happened outside my house I tried to stop him but he was to strong but eventually I escaped. My vagina would sometimes be sore and numb as a child too which was weird and my body reminded me of that last night. I‚Äôve gotten these flashbacks before both when I‚Äôve been high and sober. One time I was with my friends on the bus and my vagina felt like it was being cut into and ripped apart I had to close my eyes to try and stop my mind and body from feeling this but it didn‚Äôt help at all and didn‚Äôt go away. 

I know what I shared was intense but I just really need some help I can‚Äôt stop thinking about this and I feel like it‚Äôs going to eat me. I am just so so so so lost! Have I been raped? Am I making this up? Did my dad rape me? I just need help please this is all I‚Äôve got."		post	14.403640003507775	female	White	0.009911473840475082	na	na	na	5	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"Oh honey I am so so sorry that you're going through this.

There's nothing wrong with you. You're not crazy. You have trauma and you are processing things that your childhood brain wasn't set up to process.

I will share with you what my therapist said to me when my memories were jumbled around childhood abuse:

The specifics do not matter in the long run. Of course you want to know exactly what happened to you but in terms of recovery what matters is that it's real enough to you and because it is trauma it doesn't matter if it happened last week or decades ago. When you flash back, it's as real as it happening now.

So what matters is dealing with how it affects you now.

I know it's not viable for everyone but if you can, I would share this information with someone you trust. You don't need to be specific, you can just say ""I'm struggling with things that happened to me as a child that are coming to the surface.""

What helped me was EMDR therapy. Medication worked a little but EMDR helped my mind and body process this stuff. When memories aren't stored correctly during trauma, they sort of linger in the body and come back in physical sensations like what you experienced.

A good therapist can help you process this if you have access to one.

The best thing you can do at this point is reach out to a trusted person, even just a helpline. Someone who has dealt with this stuff before will take a whole lot of this uncertainty weight off your shoulders.

You're going to be okay. This stuff is coming up because your body believes you're mature and strong enough to start processing it."		reply	na	na	na	0.009911473840475082	strong	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"First, take a deep breath, and let your shoulders drop. You‚Äôre going to be okay, and you can get through this. I‚Äôm going to list a number of phone numbers you can call or text 24/7 for some guidance and help. You did a really big thing, and that‚Äôs writing all of this out‚Äî- that‚Äôs really hard to do! If you have any coping mechanisms that could help, use them now. When I‚Äôm emotionally overwhelmed, I would start painting my fingernails ASAP.

"Its been like that for years, im 26 now and dont even remeber how long but more then a decade i wake up and all day long i only think about everything i did wrong and embarrasing, when i failed when i made a mistake. when i lost etc.and the whole day long it just goes i loterally avoid stuff because i dont want to get triggered even more because my mind state is already like that. And ofcourse when your in that frame of mind what else can you do but attract bad, because that way of thinking weakens you, makes ne insecure, nervous, needy, and truly ashamed of myself being unable to accept myself and respect myself so how could others. 

Im so tired of always living in the past, esp everything bad. Its caused me so much harm its its own prison and cycle of destruction. Because now you cant make the right decisions, your doing everything based upon the pain in your head and everything is falling apart. Wich adds to them shame and hurt. 

Sad part is, ive had moments where i was truly content with myself, whether its was on xtc, or when i traveled. And it was night and day diffrence i was at peace with myself wich lead to me just being a healthy adult others gravitated towards. I immediately attract beautiful women who enjoy my presence and life all of a sudden seems bearable. So this way of thinking is keeping somebody who can easily fly, crawling on the ground begging for mercy.


Its such an unbearable thing and it makes sense why i immediately go towards watching porn wich to me is also harmful and thats  keeps getting progressively worse. Just so i can feel some relief and i geuss comfort. And since i was a child its been the only place i can run to keep myself from imploding and going insane.  There are litteraly moment where i scream out of pain because its so unbearable and unacceptable. Its so draining and exhaustive to hate myself and my past. It really is.

Childhood ofcourse was first non stop domestic violence, wich was already terrifying and life threatning at times it felt like i was responsible for what happened as a child. Then running awya and living in foster care then ending back up with a mom whod daily cirtcize me embarras me reject me. Then bullies at school. Plus friends who always kicked my back in.

"I'm so sorry you're going through all of this suffering. I used to ruminate and overthink a lot too, and one thing that helped me was having a ""brain dump"" every morning, just to dump all of my thoughts on the page and not have it rattling around in my brain all day. One thing I've learned when I overthink like that is, my brain isn't trying to torture me, it's just ""looking for closure"" for all the things that it felt went wrong in my life. Our brains can't help it sometimes, it likes to solve things. So one way of looking at that is there's a ""story thread"" that our brain gives us, ""this and this happened and this is the effect"" and we can tell ourselves ""yeah it's horrible and I'm a bad person/ I'm stupid/ etc"" or we can look at it as ""yeah that happened, but that's in the past. And I can make a different choice right now. Every moment presents me with a choice.""   
If you have a spiritual practice, it would be good to try doing something small that helps you feel connected to something that helps you find meaning in your life. If you don't have one, you can adopt a curious disposition and see which paths resonate with you and read about spiritual paths that you've always been curious about. You can even try a practice where you literally just ask the universe (if you're open to it) to give you signs and synchronicities for what you are meant to study. Then look for stories that relate to your specific situation. It could be in the specific spiritual texts you'll find through signs, or you can even just ask or look for book recommendations from google, or r/booksuggestions r/suggestmeabook   
helps you see that you're not alone in your struggles and that there's someone who feels what you feel too. A book that personally helped me when I was depressed years ago is a book entitled She's Come Undone by Wally Lamb. Here's an excerpt from one of the reviewers from Goodreads: 

*""She‚Äôs Come Undone is the story of a troubled teenage girl growing into a woman, her struggles and the ways in which she decides to cope with them. She puts on a tough exterior but inside is as soft as the marshmallows she finds comfort in.*  
*Dolores is plagued with heartache, hurt and uncertainty. As a teenager it seems that every person she allows close to her hurts her. She withdraws herself inward and finds comfort in the television and food, losing all interest in the outside world. By doing so she creates more problems for herself, mentally and physically.""*  


One other thing that you can try is a daily practice. That can be a prayer, a meditation, or any ritual that makes you feel grounded and connected to yourself.   


This is something that I found recently, and just doing it once created a tremendous impact in my day.   
[https://courses.crappychildhoodfairy.com/daily-practice](https://courses.crappychildhoodfairy.com/daily-practice)  


It's a free course made by someone who strugged with trauma for years and is now helping people heal their own traumas. 

In this daily practice you're asked to write about your fears and resentments twice a day, in the morning and at night, and also to meditate for a few minutes afterward. It really helps in regulating your emotions and your nervous system since you're able to process your thoughts and emotions this way, and have a way to calm down afterwards. 

I hope this helps. :) May the Compassionate Buddha smile upon you."	Sobrietyking	reply	na	na	na	0.9971112012863159	strong	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"I'm just going to jump right into the facts and try to keep this simple, any questions or advice/help are much much much appreciated.

I found out awhile ago that my grandfather was sexually involved with my cousin(she was and still is a minor). My grandmother knew about it and did nothing(as far as I know) until grandfather was caught and then they went to the nearest police station and turned themselves in. I haven't spoken to my grandparents since and my parents have been my main source of information for anything related to them as my parents have kept limited contact.

I love my grandparents very much and they are very special to me but I'm not sure how to move forward with the situation and I'm afraid of talking to them and acknowledging what has happened because I don't think I can forgive them and continue to have a relationship with them as their grandson. I'm a 30 year old gay man and I remember it taking me years to finally come out to my grandparents until I found my husband and gained the courage to tell them the truth. Now I'm finding out what they've been hiding in the closet so to speak and I feel guilty for the fact that the tables have turned but me being gay is completely different than incest child molestation.

My grandparents first court date is very close, I've been told my grandfather is very remorseful and will be pleading guilty to all charges and that my grandmother misses me and my sister very much and she blames my mother for keeping me and my sister from communication but my sister has just had her second child and she's struggling with the fact that it could have been one of her children(both girls) and I'm just overwhelmed with emotions as it's not been easy being in contact with many of my family since coming out and now there's this new development.

Should I reach out to my grandparents and gently/clearly explain how I feel after the first court visit has gone by and also notify my grandmother that my mother isn't to blame for me and my sisters lack of contact? or is it normal and perfectly healthy for me to cut contact completely with my grandparents, remember them for the good times I had growing up and do my best to love and respect the rest of my family regardless of their choice to continue a relationship with my grandparents? 

Thank you for taking the time to read this, I hope I've provided enough info that someone can lead me in the right direction, I don't have much money or time in my life to set aside right now and seek help nearby. Much love to you beautiful souls on the internet <3

"The trouble with trying to have a conversation is: your grandmother has been living in a fantasy for a long time, where she did whatever mental gymnastics are required to pretend it wasn't happening.  


Nothing you say is going to penetrate that. She's blaming others for things that simply aren't true, bc making things up is how she decided to cope. There's no knowing how many years she's been passively enabling, but her coping mechanisms aren't going to go away any time soon - they're ingrained.


So I suspect it would not only fail to give you any satisfaction, but could also lead to retraumatization.


There's no knowing how long this has been going on, or whether there are other victims, as is often the case in these circumstances. This is simply the time he got caught. 


And, to be clear, claims of remorse may be just that - merely mouthing the words the family and the court want to hear. Unfortunately, it's a type of crime with a v high recidivism rate. It's a problem we genuinely do not yet know how to cure, short of chemical castration. Unless he's willing to do that, he needs to be kept separate from minors in the future. Claiming remorse simply isn't enough - there's no way to verify if it simply performative.


A question to ask yourself: do you love the grandparents of today, someone who commits incest and his enabler? Or do you love the grandparents that you knew in the past?  It's fine to hold on to the good memories, but it's also important that current actions reflect current facts. 


I have many fond memories of my grandfather from when I was little, for example, but as an adult I found out a number of disturbing things about him, and eventually had to cut contact. That doesn't mean my happy memories are erased, but I couldn't let them cloud my adult judgment.


I hope, in the future when it is more practical, you are able to seek the help of a trauma-informed therapist to help process what's happened.  In the mean time, please be careful to prioritize protecting yourself."	Thhrowowayayyayy	reply	na	na	na	0.011924788355827332	no	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
Hey there. Courageous to ask for support. Good instinct to seek it when you need it. Ofc internet support being what it is, you‚Äôll undoubtedly have a range of amazing feedback. ;) Since it is quite personal ofc you should do your best to get clear on how you feel so your decision is the one you‚Äôll feel best with over the long term. Facts being what they are you may decide you have the capacity for compassion for all involved and handle things by being connected as you feel you‚Äôre able to. If you don‚Äôt have capacity for that, it‚Äôs understandably why. The good thing is you‚Äôre an adult and are largely removed from the danger and can perhaps be a support figure in the ways you feel called. You‚Äôll have to acknowledge the most vulnerable persons in the circumstances here and realize their impression of you may change w your actions or inactions. Sorry I can‚Äôt add much more than that but I would say a therapist that‚Äôs handling family abuse issues like this prob has the best feedback (and ways to process the traumatic side of it.)

"Recently learned about ""Jack Stauber's OPAL"", which is an intense, terrifying look at the dissociative response to severe neglect. I highly recommend that anybody with a background of neglect trauma consider watching it, with a heavy disclaimer that it is ***triggering as fuck*** and not just because of the extremely surreal music.

Spent the last week making some healthy (sic unhealthy) comparisons between the effects of incidental parental neglect and intentional parental neglect. For clarity, because I don't know if those terms are real or even make sense, here's what I mean by them:

**Incidental parental neglect:** When a parent/guardian is so self-involved, or otherwise preoccupied, that they fail to properly prioritize their child/ward.

**Intentional parental neglect:** When a parent/guardian is openly hostile toward a child/ward and intentionally deprioritizes their wellbeing and safety. 

I'd love to hear perspectives on this from people with similar backgrounds. Or anybody with more understanding of these issues, ofc!"	AlternativeSwimming9	post	36.8487701648326	female	White	0.0013496102765202522	na	na	na	4	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

I use the word abuse to label what you are describing for intentional neglect, and I use the word neglect to label what you're calling incidental neglect. I think the difference between abuse and neglect is whether or not it's conscious behavior. I'm not sure if this is the clinical distinction or not though.

"I made the same distinction for a long time, because it's a very rational deduction. My therapist helped me realize that neglect is one of two kinds of abuse, the other being intentional action. They both either cause harm or create the potential for harm, but I think that's a very difficult distinction to illustrate.

"I was asleep. His wife waking me up and kicking me out at 5am was all to familiar. Stealing a backpack from his kids so it looks like I'm on my way to school was normal. 
The worst of it was seeing other kids doing the same thing, we all dodged the cops going home. All of us knew we were prostitutes, and all of us knew any sound we made meant cops. So no one had to talk to each other.
Seeing them at school years later, both of you recognize each other from the walks home, but can't bear the pain of acknowledging it being real. So you forget.

Hi all, both my (F24) parents put me through the ringer. Even though the both equally seem just as bad, my mom seemed to have negatively impacted me the most. This has caused me to be partial towards my dad. I feel like I will always forgive him or reach out to him. With my mom, most of the time I want nothing to do with her. I don't know if I can forgive her, nor do I think I will ever have a normal relationship with her. They both kicked me out of the house and they both are addicts. I just dont know why I also seem to want a relationship with my dad over my mom. Is anyone else like this? I can provide more context if needed.	kspar90	post	20.429430078995495	male	White	0.9960786700248718	na	na	na	4	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"Hey guys, 
Story time

In third grade, I told a friend of mine to tell a girl that I love her and stuff. She went off crying (idk why she cried, kids maybe). The day after, our home teacher (which is a teacher that takes care of the class, count the absentees, helps us decorate the class, etc, while also teaching a subject) was there in the morning. The girl I told I love, gave the home teacher a channel book (which is a notebook for teachers and parents to discuss matters), she then had a look on her face and looked at me and didn‚Äôt say anything; mind you this was before our first class. 
Her class was the sixth I guess ( we had a total of 8 classes per day). So imagine the anxiety I had till the sixth class which was around 4 hours later which felt like hell. She then came in class and kept talking for a solid 5 minutes about how she thought about this class as such and such and her thoughts about us changed and stuff like that which I mostly didn‚Äôt hear because I was purposefully ignoring it, mind you, she kept looking towards me while talking. The day after, the same friend, that told the girl I love her, came and told me that the home teacher will tell everybody and got me scared to hell. This traumatized in more ways than I imagined; to the point that I‚Äôm making this discovery 13 years later. I‚Äôm always afraid of this happening even remotely again, which made me cacoon myself up and rarely ever show my emotions to people (not to the point that I‚Äôm cold, but I don‚Äôt tell people I appreciate them). 
I just realized that this may have cost me a relationship 4 years ago, which still to this day I regret, that I couldn‚Äôt pull my guts and tell her what she already knew. She‚Äôs engaged now :)
I have dated maybe once after that and she ghosted in the end. 
I don‚Äôt know what I have but I know that it has something to do with ghosting, rejection and god knows what else."	New-Caramel633	post	14.420822972017246	male	White	0.988822340965271	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"\*CW: covert sexual abuse, maladaptive daydreaming, C-PTSD, sensitive topic

&#x200B;

I (33 F) with autism, ADHD, Tourette's, C-PTSD and generalized anxiety also maladaptive daydream. It began as a coping mechanism due to childhood trauma. It's been making my work and personal life more challenging. I am also in the process of being diagnosed with Irlen syndrome, which should help with a lot of my sensory challenges.

&#x200B;

Anyway, when my body gets triggered by a sensory thing, since I've had so much trauma in my life, I feel like my mind views that as a violation even though it's literally just my body being my body. I've also been uncovering really intense trauma memories recently which are making everything worse.

&#x200B;

I have a twin sister who was born with a learning disability. Whenever my mom told the story of our birth, she always started with ""you (as in me) kicked a hole in the membrane"" which triggered early labor. She essentially told me that me doing this is what triggered my twin to develop a learning disability, yet she never outwardly said ""I blame you."" It was more that she used the power she held over me as a parent to insidiously imply she \*could\* blame me \*if\* she wanted to, but chose not to out of love. That was how fucked up her perception of love was, and I was forced to hear over and over and over again how much she loved me, and how she'd do anything for me. Actions of course proved otherwise.

&#x200B;

Growing up, my mother would come to me for affection she should have been getting from my dad, her husband. She'd force affection out of me--cuddling, kissing, spooning, etc. There were times where when I was really little, I'd wake up to her spooning me in the middle of the night with no consent. If I ever said no when she wanted affection, she'd shame me so that she could trigger a need for it in me. It took me years to recognize this as covert sexual abuse.

&#x200B;

This woman also told me that--because of the few times I made fun of my sister at school between the ages of 7-10--that I could never talk to her about being bullied. In fact, she berated me in front of the entire school cafeteria in elementary school, and the bullies viewed this as their chance to do whatever they wanted to me since they knew they'd get away with it. She also told me whenever I had success and was simply proud of myself, that I was the reason my sister would never experience the same success. She pitted me and my twin against each other from day one, and never allowed me to ever criticize my sister in any way because of something that occurred when I was a literal fetus. I've had actions I made as a literal child held over my head for decades. Now that my mom has Parkinson's, it's harder for her to get around and do things, and if I want my dad at my wedding, my fear is that I must endure seeing her. I don't feel safe around her, and feel like the daydreams I'm having at work are trauma flashbacks or my brain trying to distract me from feeling the trauma.

&#x200B;

I'm now years removed from the trauma, working my dream job for my dream company, and yet I find myself constantly pulled out of the moment by memories of her violating me, shaming me, and using me for her needs and never acknowledging my own needs. I work as a key account manager for a great company, and I have amazing coworkers and friends who support me. Yet my brain is constantly at battle with itself, and I need a way to get through the day without struggling to get to the end of it. I am great at my job when the daydreams and C-PTSD leave me alone.

&#x200B;

My dad and I will have a therapy session together later in June, and if it goes well, my dad will be present for my wedding without my mom. I've decided I'm cutting my mom out of my life for obvious reasons. I've blocked her on Facebook, and after the therapy session in June, I plan on going on my own phone plan (which is the last thing my parents are paying for). They did help us buy a house as well, but that was before I uncovered the memories of borderline sexual abuse and to be quite frank 80K (which they gave us to help buy said house) is a small price to pay for years and years of emotional abuse and covert sexual abuse from my mom.

&#x200B;

Any advice is appreciated. How do you all deal with trauma in the moment? Or dissociation? I feel like it's so much more intense because of my autism and ADHD."

"Hi everyone I need a full slap in the face, punch to the nose reality check stat as I went on a first date and I don't know what is real, what is a trauma response and I really fucking like this guy so I don't want to scare him away. Thankfully he finds my strong feelings endearing so far but I don't want to freak him out.

Background is very important. I have had a lot of abuse in my life, starting from a very very young age. And unfortunately most of my relationships have ended up abusive. I've been hurt mentally, physically and sexually. That isn't to say I haven't had good relationships there have been a few and they all started with a first date like this. 

The guy I went on the date with is someone I met when I was 16, back then we had a fling, but it was fully about sex, not emotion because stupid horny teens do horny teen stuff. But we reconnected on a dating site last week and I have had a smile plastered on my face since then. Originally we were going for coffee and dinner as a first date, but as we talked more and more and reminisced about the fun we used to have together the conversation became a lot more sexual (as well as sweet and endearing) and the date quickly turned from coffee and dinner to getting breakfast and a hotel room so we could have a full day to screw like teenagers.

That's not what ended up happening though.

We went for breakfast, and we were both so nervous we couldn't eat much, so I got a pastry and he just got Coffee. Then we started to talk, at first we were slowly catching up on what life has been like the past 15 years. Compliments, sweet comments and some dirty talk in anticipation for our hotel room. 

We got to the hotel and started having fun almost straight away. But then he started massaging me and relaxing me and kissing me. And suddenly we were laying in bed, naked, cuddling and talking. We talked like this for hours. We laid out all of our baggage, all of our traumas, basically put everything on the table so we knew what we had to deal with from eachother. 

There was some more naughty fun but he ended up hurting himself, so we stopped and kissed instead, ordered dinner, ate in bed and talked more. 

It was the most intimate, sweet, lovely first date I could ask for. He had to go back home afterwards because he has a kid (I have one too but he was at his dad's) and of course kids come first, always. We both knew going into the date that he would have to go. What we didn't expect was how much we wouldn't want him to. It was supposed to be a day of sexual exploration and getting to know eachothers body's and just having some fun together. But instead it was so so freaking romantic. 

If I find someone like this I tend to fall hard and fast. And he is not the same, he takes his time, he doesn't love easily. And I can handle that, I can reign it in and just enjoy the ride. But could he have at least done one dickish thing so I could say ""well I can't deal with this particular ick"" instead I am sat here wishing that we had done this a long time ago. Wishing I didn't have to wait weeks until I see him again. But also trying my damnedest not to fall for a guy off a first impression. 

I was supposed to have another date today, I was talking to several people who I was planning to go on dates with. But I don't want to. I want to see where this goes, I know putting your eggs in one basket isn't a good idea, but tinder is always gonna be there to fall back on. 

Please someone tell me what to do because I am gushing about this guy, I'm smiling every time I think of his face, shivering when I think of the forehead kisses. I like him, a lot. A lot more than I thought I would. Gah I feel like an idiot. 

But I don't want to scare him away, I'm scared that he is right that I'm only reacting this way because I'm not used to being treated well. But it's a good scared. Because in my heart it feels like I know he's wrong, it's not just trauma, it's because he is a kind, sweet, sexy, horny teddy bear of a man. He's a gent but he will also dominate me. It feels like I've found the right puzzle piece. But I know I come on strong and I know I'm walking the line between endearing and crazy. 

It just feels right. And theres only one other person in my life that has ever made me feel that way. 

I have to wait and I have to give him time, I need to give myself time. I need to let things run their course and hope I am right. But god I cannot get him out of my mind. I am singing, I was dancing and mouthing along to my music on the bus like a crazy person (bare in mind I'm in a wheelchair do I was facing all the other passengers but did not care at all) 

But I am also fleeing domestic abuse, I separated from my abusive ex husband in December. I need to give myself time. I just didn't expect this at all, not from a first date, not from a day that was supposed to be all about kinky sexual fun. Not from a date where booking a hotel room was involved.

"Ahh, OP? Mae here. Uhhh, y‚Äôknow, Queen of Fae? Part of that ‚Äòol Unseely Court and all. It‚Äôs ok if you haven‚Äôt heard, we‚Äôve been underground for a minute. I wanna let you know that this infatuation that you are feeling? The magical, sprinkled with fairy dust, floating on air, just-met-my-soulmate so my brain feels like it‚Äôs on fire? This is not real. It‚Äôs very close to when us Fae-folk shoot off a spell to bamboozle. 

The biggest obstacle to obtaining your hearts desire is this, you absolutely have to muddle thru and process the traumas from your past before you will be able to actually be healthy enough and be part of a healthy relationship. It has been 5 months since you were able to escape a marriage that was highly toxic, and emotionally, psychologically and physically abusive. Having to live with this kind of abuse for any length of time is incredibly difficult, and requires that you change and adapt in ways you aren‚Äôt even conscious of simply to be able to survive. Having lived in such a marriage I have a very good idea of how it feels to walk on eggshells, to need to be invisible,  to be hypervigilant and continually anticipating irrational moods and demands in order to make sure my child is safe. It takes a very long time to even recognize just how much of yourself you have lost, because the process of adapting to that abusers life is so weird, yet weirdly familiar, because it was kind of how I grew up. Dysfunctional af, but different enough so I didn‚Äôt see the red flags. Any of this sound like it might apply to you? If so, it‚Äôs guaranteed that you will not be able to resolve any of this, and heal emotionally by allowing yourself to fall into another relationship. To begin with, ANY TIME that you meet someone who is ‚Äòperfect‚Äô, checks all of the boxes, etc when you have a history of abuse? Full Stop. That could so easily be a red flag‚Ä¶and the prob is you are not taking any time to check and see.  Anyways, for what it‚Äôs worth that‚Äôs my experience. Before you even think about letting anyone near your heart, take the time to honor yourself and heal. You are so very worth it. ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèº"	sugarspice7642	reply	na	na	na	0.0012092882534489036	weak	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"I genuinely have no idea where to post this, so if its in the wrong place then just remove it.

So, I (22f) was raped last week and its been completely awful ever since (obviously). it wasn‚Äôt really forceful but it was really rough on me down there. 

My vagina hurts when i‚Äôm sitting in certain positions, and sometimes it just im intense pain when i‚Äôm not even doing anything really. 

Like for example, earlier today i was in bed and suddenly an pain down there occured and i was sobbing instantly, i can describe exactly the sensation but it hurt like in there. 

My question is, could the random pain in my vag just be coming from a flashback or is it real medical pain?

"There is a a lot to unpack here but I will try to keep it short and concise.

1)  Physically:  Significant trauma to the body,  warrants examination by an appropriate health professional. With rape,  we are talking about a biologically complex region of a woman's body.  Serious internal trauma may have occurred to one or more biological system associated with reproduction that can only be established by a gynecological exam.   Please contact a health professional as soon as possible.

2)  Psychologically:  A human being forced against their, either by brute physical force, threat of force or emotional intimidation has profound cognitive/emotional effects.  Disassociation, PTSD, anxiety, depression, suicidality are common emotional responses to rape.   It is appropriate to engage in short or long term therapy to help process cognitively the trauma, and rebuild/reconnect they psyche.

3)  Sociologically:   Sexual activity that is forced against a persons will is a crime.  The authorities should be contacted and informed.  Even if there is insufficient evidence because of the late reporting,  the authorities can be put on notice of this persons behavior and they can be on the look out for future illegal activities."

"OP, it would be a good idea if you were to go to the emergency room and ask to be seen. Tell them when you arrive that you want to talk to a rape crisis advocate first. Rape crisis advocates are specially trained to be there for you, to act as your advocate at all times, to make sure that you are not overwhelmed. They will explain what is going to happen and why, and above all they ensure that you will be in control. The exam is called a SANE exam , however I‚Äôm not sure what that actually stands for. It is done by female staff who have also been trained to be sensitive to the trauma you have gone thru, and aware that you are really scared. Nobody will force you to report what happened. This is extremely important for you to know. 
One of the other things that your advocate can do is connect you with counseling, therapy and any other services in your area that you might need. They are an amazing foundation of support. I know that this is so very hard, and I am sorry that you have had to endure this. After I was assaulted I experienced a great deal of pain and problems which were associated with the attack, and I waited 3 weeks before I went to the ER to be seen.

Your pain is pain, it doesn‚Äôt matter the origin, so whether or not it‚Äôs mental or physical wouldn‚Äôt concern me as a nurse. (I work with this population when surgery is needed.) The entire vaginal area is very sensitive and can spasm easily. The pain associated with that is called vaginismus, and GYN doctors usually treat that. It‚Äôs real and should be treated as real. Some of my patients find relief with valium for intense pain‚Äîit helps spasm. not diagnosing anything, just giving you suggestions to look into based on experience. Gentle heat to the pelvis/vaginal area and repositioning also help like you‚Äôre doing, good job.	Maximum-Internet-420	reply	na	na	na	0.9989802241325378	no	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
Rough is forceful, you were traumatized, and your body remembers. (I lost my virginity to rape and still have pain now and then).

"TL;DR: Going low contact with nmom. Need help forming message if and when she reaches out. Message is last paragraph of post. Advice of self-care and not relapsing/holding strong welcome too. Thanks! <3


I‚Äôm (32F) both bio parents are narcissistic. Parents split when I was 14 due to domestic violence. Dad was going to murder all of us and kill himself but I called the cops. They let me be the scapegoat and let the culture (we‚Äôre Southeast Asian, I‚Äôm American born) blame me for the end of their marriage. 

I‚Äôm the oldest of 4. I was treated as a spouse, mom/parent, therapist, teacher to my mom and my siblings. I parented myself and moved out when I was 18. Received more backlash from the culture.

Nmom currently remarried for about 1.5 years to someone from our culture. Hasn‚Äôt told him about her marriage to my ndad. He believes she did her best as a single mom and that she is a great mother. She values my brothers more. Has always treated me like I was an adult. Doesn‚Äôt give me any credit for helping her and raising my siblings. When my siblings misbehave, she tells me I failed parenting them. 

She blames me for everything that doesn‚Äôt go well in her life. I was physically, emotionally, and mentally abused. She takes credit for my accomplishments because I thought if I was perfect I would be loved and enough. But of course, not the reality. 

Went from being an obedient perfectionist child, to codependent, a people pleaser, emotionally regulating myself, emotionally regulating joy for my family, to over a decade of therapy and healing to acceptance. And I am now chronically ill. My partner, a phenomenal person and friend, has helped significantly with finances and has been supportive of my health and healing.

My partner, therapist, good friends, and acupuncturist say that I am a certified badass who moves with intention, compassion, and authenticity and I am not to be blamed for my parents‚Äô and my siblings‚Äô dysfunctions. 

Had another blow out from my nmom on Mother‚Äôs Day where she blamed me for all the things not going right in her life. She demanded cake and gifts for being ‚Äúa damn good mother‚Äù and curiously, I asked what has she done that was motherly recently and she said ‚Äúnothing‚Äù but that she does so much for everyone (her husband, in-laws and adult step-kids, and extended family) she deserves it. 

My sister, my partner and I took her and her husband to dinner on Mother‚Äôs Day despite her saying she was too busy. Went back to their house and the conversation turned sour. My therapist calls it cognitive distortion, where my nmom heard something that was never said. She berated and blamed me and then sent a non-apology apology a few days later in a group text with my siblings pretty much self-pitying. No direct apology to me. Didn‚Äôt expect there would be one.

Nmom‚Äôs husband was shocked at how calm I was throughout this but I believe I have reached my threshold. My heart doesn‚Äôt hurt like it used to anymore. My partner and I joke ‚Äúoh, it was just another Sunday with my mom.‚Äù

It‚Äôs been over a week and talked to my therapist about working on a message to send my mom if and when she reaches out about boundaries and limited contact with her. Therapist said to be assertive but also hold space for myself. I‚Äôm pretty straightforward so this is what I have so far. What do y‚Äôall think? Thanks in advance! :-)

Mom, I do not feel safe and comfortable around you. You need to get help. Until you get better, our relationship will not continue.

"Nice note. 

My experience is that unfortunately they may never learn. My health was better far away from nfather. Suffered his domestic violence. He‚Äôs dead now. Truth. It was a relief when he died the drama stopped. I admitted to myself that I don‚Äôt love him. Constant abuse and gaslighting. I liked somethings about him and try to hold good memories and attempts that he made in my heart. He was very sick. I hope we meet again when he‚Äôs well in another life maybe. I forgive him. I have to forgive him everyday because I hate him too. Sad but true. 

If you can, stay away from her. N runs in families and it‚Äôs a trauma response or at least according to Google. She‚Äôs doing the best she can and developed this to escape a difficult situation I think. However, they have no insight‚Ä¶. No insight.  ( My nfather screaming at me when I‚Äôm 7 months pregnant ) 

According to them, You‚Äôre wrong all the time. Run fast. I heard EMDR is good. I do 12 step and gratitude lists everyday. 

My dad‚Äôs last words to me. You‚Äôve suffered enough. Some insight there but on his deathbed. Do not suffer enough. You gave and gave. Take care

"Highly recommend looking into Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). It is an actual therapy modality like CBT is, but it's different in that it's focused on helping a person to become more aware of their body and mind in real time, so that they can be more proactive and less reactive to stressors.  It's a course that costs money and has multiple modules, but there are also tons of online resources you can use, if you can't do the classes for whatever reason. it was recommended to me through my existing trauma therapist.

The overarching goal of DBT is to help you break the patterns (over time) that you don't want to repeat. It's basically an intensive course in examining your own thoughts and reflexive reactions, and helping to reduce the intensity of the physical/emotional response you have to external stimuli, to be replaced by ones that are more appropriate in intensity and duration. It explains all the neurological and body sensations that lead to these  emotional/verbal outbursts, and how you can calm them to regulate your behavior and experience, especially as it relates to interacting with other people. 

I've been in it for about 3 months and I love it-- i honestly think it should be taught to children in schools starting in kindergarten. I have severe childhood trauma and struggle with that same issue.. I find myself doing/saying things that I don't even agree with, but are put forth by whatever emotion inside me that's being triggered by what usually amounts to normal kid behavior. I wasn't allowed to be a ""normal"" kid, so it took me awhile to realize that my parents weren't just strict, they were cruel. And that's what drives me to make change every time I feel like flipping out. 

I believe in you, I know you can do it. You wouldn't have posted here if you didn't love your kids enough to break the cycle of abuse. That right there is so much better than your parents ever did. I don't think it will ever stop being a struggle, because kids will fray one's nerves even on the best of days. But when they're really trying your patience, look into their faces, remember the baby they once were and that that precious baby still needs you to be kind and sweet, just the way you were when they were tiny.

"On a parental note, what has helped me with the 'i told you so' piece is to try and completely shift my perspective in that moment into whatever the kid might be feeling physically and emotionally. Try to remember the last time you hurt yourself in a similar way, or were in a frustrating social situation, and use that memory to relate to your kid in a genuine way. 

""Oh man, you skinned your knee? owwie, that hurts so much, doesn't it? i'm sorry kiddo. Come here, have a hug, and when you feel better, we'll go get a band-aid."" 

* offer sympathy 
* inquire about the problem
* display empathy/relate to the problem
* co-regulation
* problem solving 

This is like, boilerplate for me at this point so i don't have to think about it as much if i feel REALLY activated and can't be nice spontaneously. But it took me a long time to be able to compartmentalize it, and I still can't when i'm like, actually angry. In those moments I tell myself ""now is a good time to take a break"" and excuse myself to the bathroom until i can at least parse my thoughts.

If a kid is hurt, crying, or otherwise activated, it's important for parents to realize that THEY ARE SIMPLY NOT CAPABLE OF LISTENING in those moments. They are locked into the present, into their pain, fear, whatever, and nothing you say will even permeate that nervous system state. 

So what they need from you in that moment is physical/emotional comfort, soothing, and co-regulation, even if they have done the craziest, most terrifying thing that made you fear for their life. That fear that you have about the overall situation can be dealt with later, and on your own time. Your emotions come from inside of you, not from your child's behavior, so it's important not to place responsibility where it doesn't belong. (This is a huge concept I struggle with and is basically the reason i'm in DBT)

Co-regulation: humans are highly social creatures whose behaviors are neurologically regulated by the energy of those around them. I'm not talking about chakras or whatever, i'm talking about like.. you walk into a room of angry people, you're going to be able to feel that tension, and it might even make you anxious. When that happens, that is an example of co-regulation, because your nervous system state changes to match that of the people in the room. 

You can't even help it that your body picks up the signals.  
A crucially impactful concept called Neuroception. All humans have it, including and especially your children. So regulating yourself becomes more important than ever in those especially hectic moments.

So when a kid is hurt, activated, whatever, the first thing they need is soothing so they can get back to the state where they are able to listen. In that time, you don't even need to say anything... but if you choose to, it should be oriented toward helping the child return to a state of CALM.  Then, and ONLY then, will they even be able to internalize anything you're saying about ""why they got hurt"" or whatever. 

My preference is to calm/soothe first, then ask questions that sort of help the kid to understand the process of how they got hurt. If there was a singular reason (e.g. shoes untied), you can coach them on remembering to check on their shoes every once in awhile. The main issue is that all of that ""i told you so"" lecture stuff is a throwback from a time when people had literally no idea how to communicate with kids, and didn't care to study it. Children were to be seen and not heard, and admonished if they failed in either of those efforts. Since we're cycle breakers, that's not going to fly anymore. 

So you have to remember that between you and your kid, you're the only one who actually has mature emotional regulation skills. So you have to employ them strategically and even forcefully against your own impulses. 

LOL I make it sound so easy, and it is not. But it feels so good to notice when and where you have changed. I wish you the absolute best of luck. 

PS - you may find [this podcast](https://www.justinlmft.com/podcast) illuminating, as I did. Much of the info I gave here came from the overall concept of the Polyvagal Theory. This guy explains it in lay terms, in incredible detail, to help people understand the degree to which their own nervous system can get out of whack when we get upset. It's like an evolutionary thing that stems from animals needing to detect danger in our environments (neuroception).

I experienced some really unpleasant things with an ex that was at least 6 or 7 years ago now and it took me a while to move past but I went quite a while without feeling like it was really affecting me anymore (at least 3 or 4 years). Sure I would still be cautious with people and get upset every now and then but it was basically a thing of the past that I never thought about unless it was directly brought up. Recently I've been feeling upset over it again with no obvious triggers. Just hearing the name makes me feel ill sometimes and I feel like I'm back to that low point some nights. I've had panic attacks out of nowhere and I don't understand why it's suddenly resurfaced and I feel really ridiculous for getting upset over it sometimes. I've been in a happy relationship for over 3 years now so it especially makes me feel bad for having these feelings when I know my current partner is different. I'm not sure how to cope with this and any advice would be appreciated.	popcornscavengerrr	post	26.401842484849112	female	White	0.9979214072227478	na	na	na	2	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"I‚Äôm sorry you have had these experiences‚Ä¶ It truly sucks. 
(Not a phycologist  just lived with trauma my whole life)
Your body remembers past trauma even if you don‚Äôt. It stores it deep in your mind and body and sometimes your body has a kind of relapse when it begins begins trying to truly heal from it. I have had this several times. 

When your body experiences a traumatic trigger like a certain tone of voice or a sudden loud noise. Your brain kind  of transports you back to that moment in time where it occurred. I suffer from anxiety disorder and have had a pretty brutal experience with a partner myself which caused me some bad trauma. 

Have trouble dating still cause it brings back all the feelings from before. Even if I know its not happening.

What helps me is I take a deep breath and just hug myself. Gently scratch my head, rub my arms hold my cheeks. And say to myself. ‚ÄúI am safe.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI am alive.‚Äù ‚ÄúI am breathing‚Äù ‚ÄúI am loved.‚Äù ‚ÄúI am not there.‚Äù ‚ÄúI am here.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt here.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt hurt me.‚Äù 

Holding yourself in a calming manner, similar to how a mother strokes her kids hair and rubs their back. Helps to bring your body back to the present it will also help your body stop associating certain triggers with those feelings as you are recorrecting them. ‚ô•Ô∏è"	popcornscavengerrr	reply	na	na	na	0.9979214072227478	strong	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"I tend to have trauma response reactions when my fianc√© and I have difficult emotions. For example he might say something that makes me feel dismissed or unheard, unintentionally, and I go straight into fight/flee/freeze mode. Then I get quiet because I don‚Äôt want to explode on him, and am unsure what exactly I‚Äôm feeling or how to communicate it, but we end up just continuing to talk about it and I end up doing the trauma response anyway. Which usually sounds like ‚Äúare you mad? Are you wanting to break up with me now? How do I fix it? I promise I‚Äôll fix it and won‚Äôt react like this anymore. I‚Äôm sorry for being this way.‚Äù

And I just switch into over-apologizing and wanting to ‚Äúrun away‚Äù from the situation, which leaves him confused. 

I just know I‚Äôm working on this trauma response. I want to stay calm and deal with triggers, but sometimes I just feel overloaded and i have an episode. It‚Äôs unfair to both of us and I realize I need to and want to change, desperately. We are in marriage counseling and I‚Äôm in my own personal counseling. 

This isn‚Äôt a make or break it issue, but it‚Äôs our main source of relationship stress. 

How do I get better at pausing or taking a breath when I feel the trauma response coming on?"	ikari_shinji_001	post	26.456578046527678	female	White	0.9832300543785095	na	na	na	8	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

The ‚Äúare you mad, do you want to break up with me?‚Äù Response is fawn which is also part of fight/ flight/freeze.

"Both my darling husband and I come from abusive homes, so we both have trauma responses to stressful situations. As you can imagine, that can get pretty miserable for all concerned.


We have developed a system that helps enormously. When things get to the point of fight/flight/freeze/fawn, and we are not at our best, we physically separate until we have had time to calm down and think through things under less stressful conditions.


Knowing that it is nearly impossible to be articulate under these circumstances, we have a sign we give each other, which is to hold up our hand (as if to say ""stop"") and then one or both of us leaves to find a quiet private space, even if it is just the bathroom, anywhere we can shut the door and be alone.


Having a physical signal is great bc we don't have to *say* anything, and bc it instantaneously communicates the need to deescalate and separate.


Later on, when we feel truly ready to discuss it calmly, we can choose to do that free of a trauma response."	ikari_shinji_001	reply	na	na	na	0.9832300543785095	no	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"Look into therapies like CBT & DBT. I have found grounding myself back into the environment can help; but everyone is different. 

Grounding, if you didn‚Äôt know, is bringing your senses to the now.

Also, communication is important. ‚ÄúI feel ______ when ______‚Äù is a great example. Also look into setting up a word or signal that would indicate a need for a short break to regroup.

"To be fair, the force of my crying had caused a nosebleed and I was covered in blood. 

It's not all bad. I know I made a mistake today. Intentions of kindness and love don't matter. I lost two very dear friends over a postcard and more besides. 

I've come a long way, though. I called my family and accepted help. I didn't hurt myself more than a slap. I am trying not to internalize the fact that my greatest fear in the whole world - the one my friends promised they loved me too much to allow - happened. I don't know that I'm lovable to anybody without a genetic predisposition toward me. Not for longer than a few years, anyway. But what was said to me today was cruel, and no self-respecting adult has their fucking boyfriend text a mutual friend to say they aren't wanted by either anymore. I couldn't have admitted that a year ago. I would have bowed under the weight of blame and accepted it as my due. 

That's fucking progress. Even if I now lay here in the dark grieving, and I don't know that I'll ever trust anyone like that again. I can content myself with my family. I am so lucky to have them, and if they were going to stop loving me, they would have already."	mustnttelllies	post	31.795499449625325	female	White	0.014671366661787033	na	na	na	2	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"A few nights ago was my mom's birthday. We went out for drinks (i was designated driver and only had one beer) and we all ended up at one of our close friends homes. They are moving soon and giving things away and the wife gave me a beautiful green dress renaissance style. I was so excited i changed into it right away. When the husband saw me wearing it he said ""oh that's the kind of dress you'll only get to wear once because once your husband sees it..."" And then he mimed my dress being ripped off. It made me incredibly uncomfortable and i sort of nervous laughed it off. It's still bothering me. This happens often, whenever i wear nice clothing and I'm not accompanied by my husband. It makes me extremely uncomfortable and i have spend a huge chunk of my life trying to dress homely and look like a bitch so that nobody walks up to me or makes rude comments like that. I've even practiced breast binding and wearing strictly male clothing and cutting all of my hair off at one point to avoid the inappropriate attention i get. I want to be invisible, i wish i was strong enough to stand up for myself without feeling like it would inconvenience everyone around me. I'm tired of hating my own gender and yet i never want to wear another dress as long as I live."

"From my own experience, I‚Äôd say that in your position, I would probably have reacted the same way, but underneath the nervous laughter and the self-aggression (breast binding and cutting off your hair) there is a deep wound of never being allowed to express aggression to others, especially to men. Whether it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs unsafe, feels unsafe, or is just impolite and I‚Äôm supposed to be polite and good and kind and understanding no matter what jackasses other people are, it‚Äôs been imposed on me that it is forbidden to defend myself in those moments, and that brings confusion and shame. 

I find it‚Äôs a million times easier to feel that rightful anger for someone else, a friend or a random internet poster, than for myself. I‚Äôm feeling it for you! Fuck their convenience, this is about you feeling safe and okay in the world. 

Try visualizing responding differently to that situation. The dude isn‚Äôt directly threatening you, he‚Äôs describing a threatening situation (at least in the sense of your possessions being destroyed without your consent, hopefully not that sex with your husband is threatening) as if it were normal. It‚Äôs not. How could you respond in a more self protective manner?

I like something like ‚ÄúOh no, my husband knows better than to try something like that with me. He rips something off of me, I rip something off of him‚Äù with a slightly suggestive eye raise.

I wanted to say something right away about how inappropriate it was but i was afraid of speaking up and ruining my mom's birthday by causing a scene. So i kept quiet and sat nervously in my chair with my legs closed and kept pulling my dress down to cover as much as possible of my legs. I always formulate a response but too late, the freeze mechanism always gets to me first and i freeze up like a deer in headlights.

"On progress: Progress is a messy tangle more than a straight line, or even than like plateaus and cliffs. It's a good sign that you're feeling stuff, sometimes; that's better than never! And it's OK that you're dissociating some of the time too. I relate to both of those a lot. But when I look at where I'm at now vs a year ago, I'm a lot more able to engage with my baggage and process it *on average* than I was then.

Sometimes the ups and downs take weeks, sometimes hours. For me it's kinda all over the place.

This graph is always what comes to mind, especially for trauma. Sometimes it even goes down below the starting point for a while.

And honestly being able to move between these two points is healthier for me than always being stuck in either one of those two. Being crippled with overwhelming emotion isn't sustainable, and being stuck in dissociation for months on end will get me nowhere. From that movement I can shift the path around while still moving forward. ""Titration"" is a relevant term here; even dissociation is a method of titration, if a blunt one."

"**TLDR**: Basically, yes ‚Äî this is a super common experience and a very normal part of trauma recovery & healing. *This doesn‚Äôt mean that you‚Äôre not progressing* ‚Äî it just means that healing isn‚Äôt linear and it doesn‚Äôt happen in a vacuum. There are so many variables that go into how we feel or react on a given day that reacting inconsistently is fairly normal ‚Äî *especially* with trauma recovery. 

*(I wrote the above after I wrote the below and it‚Äôs honestly less of a tldr and more of the stuff I most want you to know as you‚Äôre dealing with this. Below is some thoughts on the why this happens/feels this way.)*

- - -

Honestly I think people often underestimate both the impacts of stress (on our minds *and* bodies) and the stress of trauma and healing from trauma. 

There‚Äôs a phenomenon called general stress adaptation syndrome that helps our bodies to manage stress when we need to. I often simplify it as borrowing stress-coping energy from the future. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this is contributing to your experience. (i.e.: The stresses/distresses come up and your body borrows from the future to cope, but then suddenly there‚Äôs too much stress in the holding zone and it has to overflow.)

But also (from personal experience), days/moments like the one you had two days ago are *exhaaaaausting* and two days might not be enough time to recover from that ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôre dealing with the stresses of trauma and life at the same time. 

And finally, there‚Äôs a set of analogies that I like using to demonstrate why we might react very differently to the same things on different days (they essentially boil down to ‚Äòit‚Äôs the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back). My favourite of them is the backpack of rocks. Each rock in the backpack represents stress that we‚Äôre carrying with us. A lot of us wake up with rocks already in our backpacks. A lot of us have backpacks that have been warn down my trauma, chronic stress, or burnout that we haven‚Äôt had time/energy/resources to repair ‚Äî as a result, it might carry fewer rocks than it used to. Every little bit of stress we continue to carry gets added to the backpack ‚Äî sometimes just pebbles, other times giant stones that threaten to tip us over. But we‚Äôre used to carrying rocks ‚Äî especially the ones we carry with us every day ‚Äî so we might not take them into consideration when we wonder why that small rock made us collapse or why the same rock only makes us collapse sometimes."

"Hey, everyone. My name is Taali and I‚Äôm a singer, producer and songwriter. Among other things, I suffered 51 days of fever and serious illness during the first wave of COVID in 2020 NYC. I was fortunate to eventually move to Amsterdam as an artist in residence. There I finished an album about this newest iteration of trauma in my life, thinking, always, about the mosaic we keep reassembling of ourselves. 

I recently put out a video for a song about this (and wrote a piece in BUST Magazine about my experience with trauma - the video requires no real trigger warning but the piece *absolutely* does).

Hey I was 31 when I came to the realisation of the horrors of my childhood. I remember asking myself the same question. Now what? Now I want to live and not be defined by these monsters. I lost my patience with therapy. I lost my patience with recounting the years and the past. I became emotionally intoxicated and depressed all in the span of one year. I understood also as months went by and I saw no  appeasement in site despite my efforts that healing is such a silent striker. It happens slowly and takes you by surprise. somehow once you take your life and yourself as someone worthy of life and vivacity - which they are ofc, but trauma makes you feel otherwise, thats its true power - then small steps determine other steps and you end up with an edifice that is truely yours.

"I (f24) lost my daughter two Decembers ago. She was stillborn at 25 weeks. It hit me and my husband (m25) really hard. Three months after her death, I got pregnant with my second son. Fast forward, my two sons(m3)(m4months)  are here safe. I‚Äôm so incredibly grateful for them. 
Some days the grief is extremely strong and it feels like a giant void without her here. I was so excited to have a daughter.  
How I was coping was thinking about planning another pregnancy. 
Well we recently found out my second son has a lung disease. The same lung disease my older son has. Luckily, it is not super serious and it is something both of them will grow out of. My first has pretty much grown out of a lot of the symptoms. My second son has a mild case. They have very normal lives and are expected to live normal lives as adults. I do feel like the recent diagnosis changes things. 
To be completely honest, I thought if I had another daughter it would at least partially fill the void. 
Now that may not be an option, I‚Äôm unsure how to cope. There are a lot of triggers for me. Anyone that‚Äôs pregnant with a girl. Seeing mothers and their daughters, especially if they‚Äôre around the same age my daughter should have been. I guess I‚Äôm just having hard time accepting and moving forward. 
Any advice, solidarity or reassurance is welcome.

Did you have a proper burial or any other kind of farewell ceremony? Many people find that very helpful. Or maybe a therapist could help guide you through your grief and let go of the pain.

"Its that you are reflecting your emotions and found out, that you need help - and thats important. Its normal, as dumb it sounds. What people help who are griefing is what they already really like to do e.g. what makes you happy (maybe cooking, do sports, spiritual stuff like going to church). Everything what makes you feel good in a healthy way is allowed. 

What could help is to find a way to integrate your daughters existence in your life. Its a way to deal with grief. Giving her a name (if she hadnt already one and giving her a place.  You will always be her mama, no matter what and your son will always be her big brother. He knows, believe me. You can DM me if you have any questions.

first time posting here, just want to vent a bit about my situation. i have cptsd and borderline personality disorder, and it doesnt define me, but in reality it weighs on me. I feel like i always sound like the victim, even though i was abused my whole childhood, but i hate it. I'm all alone, have always been and always will be. i built walls that i cant hide, i dont understand why everything had to happen to me. It seems as if im stuck in a revolving door and reminding myself how much i really hurt inside. I think i started therapy too late, and i feel like everyone has moved on but me. i don't like the feeling that i have to live the rest of my life traumatized, it goes away and somehow finds a way to creep back in. Am I alone in this?	AudienceIll7272	post	20.288917666737973	female	White	0.9828827977180481	na	na	na	2	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

Please remember that you did not deserve anything that happened to you. However, you do have to deal with it. It sounds like you are making the effort and that is all you can ask of yourself.

"i had sex for the first time since i was raped tonight. i dont know why i did it, i guess i felt impulsive or i had high hopes that he would actually want to just hangout and go on a lil date. but i was wrong, i dont know why but i cant seem to say no or stop to anyone thats doing this to me. its so frustrating..

but anywho‚Ä¶ me and this guy, Liam, we dont know each other well, we just started messaging today. on tinder and its okay and we‚Äôre having good conversation and hes from out of town and so we make plans for tonight. before we even scheduled a time, i had told Liam that i have bad anxiety and everything is scary, and he agrees to make sure i am comfortable and whatnot. then the clock struck 7:30 pm. he was outside waiting and i was a ball of anxiety as i got in, he was veru nice and asked if i wanted to dine in or juar order food st his hotel and nervous me said it didnt matter to me. he chose his hotel room, and so we drove there. we made small talk before entering the room and i sat on the edge of the bed staring at my shoes before he came and sat down, and we were close and i kept staring at my shoes or my nails because i knew if i looked at him that he would kiss me. we ended up on the bed, watching a tv show and Liam had grabbed my hand, holding it and stroking it tenderly. it was nice but nerve racking. as time went on he turned to look at me a few times, i ignored it because i wasnt ready to kiss him. he rubbed my bicep as he held my hand, but then suddenly he went to tuck hair behind my ear and i still tried jot to look at him for too long. but not even 2 minutes go by and he grips my chin lightly and turns it to him and he leans in. there was no avoiding it, i was about to be kissed. he kissed me yea and it was turning heavy, i didnt know when to pull away but he kept going and eventually he went for my neck. he was on me after kissing my neck and stuff, and he did something that kinda scared me‚Ä¶ he pinned my wrists against the headboard behind me, and i couldnt move and he kept kissinng me. it was him being dominant i think? but it scared me lol. and well he ended up undressing me and stuff, not saying a word to me as he was doing everything. and eventually i was naked and he was doing stuff down there which ill leave to the imagination‚Ä¶ and it hurt but it was tolerable, but then he wanted to add another finger i was in pain and said that, ‚Äúow that hurts‚Äù or something. and he took it out. speeding up he tried to enter me but it didnt fit so he came up and was hovering over my chest as he put his cock in my face to suck and i did it‚Ä¶ and he tried to go in and it fucking hurt. i could feel all of it, it was too big for me and i know i had a pained expression because it hurt a lot but i never told him to stop when i really wish i did. and it went on for a while. him telling me to go into a certain position, him shoving himself in me, me in pain, and him bringing his cock to my face, him choking me occasionally. but eventually he was gonna cum and he did, on my chest‚Ä¶ and he gave me toilet paper for it and he went to grah the pizza and i went to the bathroom. i had to not think and just suppress my tears and emotion.

idk i just felt so disgusting. 

ok so i should probably clarify that i know this is not rape nor am i saying it was. it was consensual and he didnt know so its kinda my fault for not saying no or anything to him lol 

but yea i just needed to get this off my chest, and honestly i kinda wanted to ask a question or two? maybe three?

1. why is it that i am constantly thinking, hoping, and praying the sex end as soon as it starts?
2. will i actually like sex or will i just hate it forever?
3. why cant i say no or stop? (my past was never violent so idk??)"	No_Description7684	post	18.652909426621235	female	White	0.9951203465461731	na	na	na	4	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"Hey there. Good idea to reach out for support (although Reddit isn‚Äôt the place for qualified mental health stuff obviously.)

This isn‚Äôt medical advice but you experienced trauma with the first incident, and revisited it with the second, that‚Äôs for sure. This is enough to need qualified trauma therapy and good news, it is possible to heal from this. 

That said it‚Äôs really a good idea to get support sooner than later, because as you can tell, it‚Äôs getting a bit more complex with time and additional experiences. 

Your trust, vulnerability, safety and deepest levels of emotional stability can get messed up when things like this happen. So, its normal for you to experience what you are after what happened.  

1. Because your deepest levels of emotional safety aren‚Äôt ready to enjoy. They are still compromised and fearing the worst. There is an emotional and a physical pain side to this.  

2. You can heal and with time, the right support and trustworthy partners you can enjoy sex very much again.  

3. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up over what you didn‚Äôt have capacity to do. It‚Äôs normal to shut down when the body is overloaded with emotions and possible danger. 

It may have been confusing for the partner if he didn‚Äôt get feedback and thought you were enjoying but this isn‚Äôt an excuse. We all need to learn consent is very important and to always be sure it‚Äôs safe to move forward. 

But it‚Äôs your responsibility to keep yourself out of situations that further compromise you. Tinder is for people who are generally expecting to have sex so there may be an underlying momentum into situations that you‚Äôre not ready for. No shame that you tried and wanted to experience sex again and to do so on your own terms. This is promising that you felt ready enough to encounter, experience sex again but to heal fastest, take this all into consideration. 

The first and second time were both very intense. You should expect that your system can physically shut down when it isn‚Äôt ready to communicate, as it did here and in other situations like this.. so you have to take that part seriously. You don‚Äôt want to end up with someone who‚Äôs even more intense and your body can‚Äôt speak up to say no. Scary stuff. 

So‚Ä¶ DO get trauma therapy AND put yourself only in sexual situations where you have a really really really good reason to trust your partner (sorry, no Tinder or random hookups until your therapist says you‚Äôre central nervous system is ready for this.)

Is that helpful?"	No_Description7684	reply	na	na	na	0.9951203465461731	weak	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"I rarely comment here and will probably burn this account after posting, but... your experience sounds a lot like mine. Too much like mine. Rape culture tells us that if someone pressures us into it and we eventually say yes, then it isn't rape. But it doesn't sound like you wanted it. Just because you said you wanted it doesn't mean you wanted it *like that*, either.

The sex aversion you have can heal. The other commenter is right that when we go through awful stuff, we can sometimes push through similar situations again and again, maybe in the hopes things will be different. To some extent that's normal, but putting yourself through things in the hopes someone will break the cycle can lead to more abuse.

There isn't much I can do to take away the pain and shame you feel. Just like you, I went back, thinking it must have been my issue, not theirs. That I just needed to relax more and stop being so anxious.

It is weird for someone to initiate with someone who is obviously anxious and panicking. It's weird for them to push past your obvious dissociation, panic attacks, etc. I seriously doubt if the roles were reversed that you would have done the same thing.

There is good news though. Not everyone is like that. It turns out when it's really truly enjoyable and comfortable, you'll know. It's supposed to feel good."	No_Description7684	reply	na	na	na	0.9951203465461731	weak	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"Hi all. My boyfriend has been pretty awful to me for the last 6 months or so at least. We have been together for a year and a half. Initially, everything was great - but I learned he was mirroring me. I don't have many boundaries (I struggle with them) but one of them is that I do not want pornography in my relationships - I have no judgement to people that watch it, but I have a lot of trauma surrounding it and I know how it makes me feel. He said he also had a major issue with it due to trauma. I learned that was a lie in December and that he had been looking at it regularly, mostly daily, for up to hours at a time. He said he ""knew it would hurt me, but didn't think it would hurt me that bad"" and ""didn't think I'd ever find out"". As that lie unraveled, so too did lies about his past, his life, etc. I have standing trust issues anyway - but I love him, more than I've loved anyone else, so I've tried to work through them. 

He has not been kind with helping me through. He is frustrated that I am not ""over"" what happened. He is angry that I do not trust him. He still lies to me about things like buying fast food (which he does 3-4 times a week, despite a number of health issues that would dictate he should NOT be doing that) and says he lies to me because I will ""judge or scold him"" - to me, that sounds like he is blaming me for his choice to lie. 

He gets mad and he shuts me down. I have anxious attachment from major childhood trauma and he knows it. He is an avoidant. We have created tools and ways around this, like when he is overwhelmed he has agreed to say ""I love you, I'm not leaving you, but I am overwhelmed and need some space right now"". He holds to that \~25% of the time. The rest of the time, like today, he tells me how it's unfair that he has to do everything I want, he never gets what he wants, and if I have a panic attack he tells me I am manipulating him. Today he screamed at me on the phone for trying to talk to him about a fight that happened yesterday. Granted, he said he didn't want to talk on the phone - but I am hitting the point where I am exhausted with always being the one that has to give in (and give him whatever space he wants) and never being given the chance to work through problems. If he DOES stay on the phone, he stonewalls me, says he ""doesn't care"", ""doesn't give a shit"", ""has nothing to say"", etc. He will say cruel things to me that afterwards he says he doesn't mean, but has acknowledged he does it just to hurt me. 

For whatever stupid reason, I just can't leave. I know I should. I know this isn't healthy. I know that I am pulling a huge amount of weight, trying to work things out, trying to communicate and compromise, and he is deflecting at me and holding resentment for things that I am not even aware of, because he won't tell me about them. I ask him how I can help, what he needs, etc. and he says he doesn't know. I ask him to think about it, and he still doesn't know. I feel like I'm going insane and I don't know what's fact or fiction. I don't know how to not talk about when something is bothering me - it literally feels like it's eating me alive. Part of the issue, I think, is I am still living with my ex of 2 years as I haven't been able to afford to move out (I live in NY, cost of living is extremely high). My ex SA'd me several times throughout our relationship. I think the idea of being alone, living in this situation still, is scarier than staying in this relationship. But I often find myself telling myself that maybe I'm just not saying what I'm trying to convey right, because otherwise it would matter, right?....We both see our own therapists and a couple's counselor as well.

Anyway - TL:DR, in a relationship involving verbal abuse, stonewalling, and degradation when he is angry. When things are good, they're amazing. When he's mad, he's awful. I want to work out issues, he wants to sweep them under the rug. How do I protect myself when I'm just not ready to leave? And how do I get my brain to acknowledge the reality of the situation, that ""if he wanted to, he would"" and stop hoping for change - to just accept the situation as it is?"

TW for grooming and abuse, also of sexual nature (not detailed, only mentioned). I am 22 years old and trans masc, please use he/they pronouns for me and refrain from referring to me as a girl. Thank you in advance.

&#x200B;

I grew up in an abusive household with a mom who suffered from raging, untreated BPD and other issues and a dad with addiction problems who left early and whom I did not have much contact to. When I was 13, Mom and I moved and I got into contact with someone through a sports community at the new city. 

He was in his early 30's, I don't actually remember how old exactly, but he, his wife (early-mid 20's) and I grew close and I entered a ""relationship"" with him when I was 14, almost 15. This does include bedroom contact, and did from the beginning. 

Another woman joined us at some point and another one in 2021, and he had other loose relationships or affairs next to us, including two of my friends who were a tiny bit older than me. This was labeled as an open poly relationship, but none of us was allowed to date other men. I was not asked for consent when he got close to my friends.

I was constantly gaslit and manipulated, coerced, kept quiet and used. I know that now. I supported the last girl who joined us to leave in early fall of 2022, and I too finally left in October 2022 after a month long struggle against him and old structures. She and I remain close friends.

Now I am sitting here and wonder if one could call what I lived in for almost a decade was a cult or a cult like structure. My points for that assumption include his charismatic nature, the strict hierachy in the group, the rules he set and enforced that were backed with either pseudoscience or religion. I am not religious, but he and his wife were, he was new apostolic (if I translated and spelled that correctly) and she was catholic.

&#x200B;

I am confused. How am I supposed to interpret this? I'd appreciate some input or advice. Thank you so much, have a lovely day and remember to keep fighting because there is a lot to be fighting for."	moss-greene	post	37.51050042718064	female	White	0.005654251202940941	na	na	na	2	traumatoolbox	'ethnicity: no prediction, age: 22, gender: male/transmasculine, explanation: the author self-identifies as a 22-year-old transmasculine individual who prefers he/they pronouns. their ethnicity is not specified in the text.'

"I'm sorry you went through this. You were young, and the adults in the world around you failed to keep you safe.

Have you looked at the BITE model?

From just what you share here, it appears to tick several boxes. As all else, the reality of cults is a lot more fluid and nuanced than in media. A ""cult like structure"" with one particular leader just is a cult. Doesn't need to be corporate or organised religion or anything, and small situations like you describe are probably more common anyway.

This is really hard to process because of how difficult it is to tune the lenses you view the world through back to regular reality, but you can do it! I'm cheering you on from afar. 

Try to stay mindful of your thoughts, associations, and impulses, and be a bit critical of where they come from.

I just finished my first year of college and I've been home for about two weeks now and somehow my home life feels worse. I mean, it honestly should be better because my parents are going through divorce and my dad is effectively out of the picture. Between my parents, my dad is the mostly absent alcoholic who loved to yell, throw things, and punch holes in the wall, while my mom is just kinda... negligent and sometimes weirdly manipulative and just confusing. So, as it stands, I really should be doing a lot better, but I really, really cannot stand my mom. And being in a house with her makes me constantly anxious.

"What is this considered?



I‚Äôm going to tell my story, you tell me what you think. So I was a stupid 18 year old girl in highschool and I was on tinder for fun. And I was on my instagram then this 28 year old man, named T***ir L**** (32 now) slid in my DMs and said hi. At first I wanted to decline the message because I knew men are annoying. However, I accepted it and started talking At first I was just trolling himin the DMs and then sent the screenshots to my friend and was like haha look at me I trolled him. My friend told me to be nicer, so I took her advice and added him on snapchat. Like every guy he was flirting with me and all then he slowly started to leave me on opened and ignoring me. He would only hit me up to ask me if i'm free or not. And I was so attracted to this dude that one day I decided to meet up with him.
I got in his car and he was driving around my block till he found a spot to park. And he's like ""so what do you want to do?"" and im like i dont know. This was the only guy I ever met up with and I never had a boyfriend or anything before so it was awkward and I didn't really know where he was going. He asked for a hug so I gave him a hug and got out of his car and went back. Then I message him ""we can do more next time"" and he messages me back and he's like ""if you come back rn, would that count as a second time?
"" showing passive
aggressiveness. So i went back in his car And he started touching me. He kissed me and sucked my breasts. I was terrified but also excited at the same time. I just started obsessing over him more. But he also made me feel uncomfortable so I deleted him from all my social media accounts to try to avoid him. I felt like I was getting over him until he slid in my DMs again a few months later. And he was like
""I'm sorry for being disrespectful and dumb"" and I was being nice and said ""oh so he added me back with another act/game. He saved nudes and then I felt bad so he added me back with another act/ game. He saved my nudes and then I felt bad afterwards so i asked him to delete it and he's like fuck me first then l'll delete them. I was like whatever. I would block him and unblock him then he would add me back right away. And he would message me right away too. Then he eventually stopped talking to mme and his messages would be ""when"" or ""free?"" and thats it. Eventually I gave in and decided to hookup with him. I gave him head in his car and got out then he just drove away. He didn't message me for like two days then he's like ""your head was really good"" l asked him if he deleted my nudes again and he replied ""nah"" and I asked him to delete them and he tells me that he'll delete them after I give him in his car and got out then he just drove away. He didn't message me for like two days then he's like ""your head was really good"" I asked him if he deleted my nudes again and he replied ""nah"" and I asked him to delete them and he tells me that he'll delete them after I give him oral again. Then he started showing up near my place when I didn't even call him over. He would be like ""I'm outside"" to get me to come out and when I didn't, he's like
""you owe me"" I think he kept screenshots of my replies to send it to his friends. I met up with him a month later. This time he starts driving around and kept telling me to stay down. It felt like he was filming me without telling me he was.
He kept asking questions while I was down.
He would be like ""Is this the biggest dick you sucked?"" then he dropped me off and drove off I felt uneasy the whole time. I blocked him right away, then a month later he hits me up again and he's like ""I wanna fuck you"" trying to degrade me. He would act like he owns me and can control me. This time he tricked me by saying he‚Äôs outside and that he‚Äôll buy me lunch. He reclined my seat and said ""i have an idea"" he got on top of me and thrusted his penis so hard that it was hard for me to breathe and i choked. I felt violated. I had my hands on his hips he said ""grab my ass"" i did t feel comfortable and a dropped my hands from his hips to the side of the my seat. He ejaculated in my mouth and then said ""{**k"" with a malicious grin on his face and then he's like ""where do you f**k other guys?"" and then i try not to say anything and his like ""hmm?"" and i said ""at their place"" and then he leaves me in the middle of the street. I felt violated and humiliated. Not only he did that but he bought out the company my dad worked at and got my dad laid off so we can't afford rent and we can move out of our house so his rich girlfriend can rent my house.

"I've been on my healing journey for several years now and I'm wondering what folks have to say about the role of partners and friends in a healing journey? 

My history with CSA has made it very challenging for my romantic/intimate relationships and I'm thinking it's because the roles and expectations I have about support and partnership might've been unclear to my past partners. I think part of me doesn't know what I'm ""allowed"" to ask for in terms of support and partnership. Or what is reasonable to ask for. In part because I'm not entirely sure what a ""healthy"" relationship looks and feels like or how to describe it on paper.

Perhaps a better way to ask this question is how are some ways that your intimate partners and friends support you/what are some ways you have asked to be supported in these relationships?

 When I was in 1st grade, I was at my best friend's house. While riding his bike, my friend fell off and broke his foot. I ran into the house and got my friend's father to come out and help him. The next day at school, the teacher told us that my friend's father had passed away in his sleep the night before. I remember bits and pieces of that day, but I don't remember how I felt about it. 25 years later, I still see my friend's father in dreams, and think about him often. Why don't I remember how I felt, and is it normal to still think about this man I only knew when I was a child? What can I do to relieve the anxiety and grief I feel about all of this?

"Hi,

recently a close friend of mine has opened up about her trauma of being sexually molested by a former crush in her teens. She has told me that when we are just the two of us it triggers her trauma and she feels unease or even close to a panic attack. She made it clear that I didn't do anything and that she loves spending time with me but its super hard for her right now since she just figured out why (she didn't realized she was traumatized for a while). I do not have a problem with that and with her reassurance that I'm not actually scary to her I agreed on meeting with at least one more person more next time. However I still wanna talk about it with someone to really understand the situation but I don't want to go around exposing her trauma. I would love to talk to my dad because he is a licensed therapist and doesn't know her so it wouldn't be too awkward. Another option would be my other friends who live in my hometown (not the town me and that friend live, they also never met her).

"I think you can talk with your dad about it, no problem. As long as you don't bring up her name or he doesn't already know her in some way, I think that's totally fine. You're not sharing her personal info in any way that could affect her. 

Talking to your dad, your own therapist, or anyone else who is very close and trusted to you is your own business, and telling them ""please don't mention this to anyone else"" should be about as far as you need to go to ensure privacy. 

You're a good friend for considering what would be respectful to her, but you're allowed to ask for help and guidance for yourself as well, from the position of a supporter. Not just on the best way to be there for her, but also if any of it is upsetting or confusing to you. It's ALWAYS better to talk things out than trying to figure things out on your own.

"Good question.

I love that you are a friend to her and want to support her.

From my experience, as someone who is sexualy assaulted in the past, I would absolutely love someone as a friend as considerating as you are.

Maybe you can ask her first, and explain that you want to help her to include other people in 'the hangouts', but that you don't know how to answers questions if someone asks you why they are invited when you and your friend want to hang out.

Ask her that you want to answer such questions without spilling private information about her.

You could also say to your friend that you want to help her understand better, because you (luckly) don't have experienced such horrible aspects of life. You may tell her that you want to search some know-how's, to do's and not to do's as a friend. 

Say that you think someone else could offer you the insight, so she doesn't have to translate her needs in moments when she would be very triggered. 

Say that you want to upheld your friendship and trust. And that you want to know how much you can disclose within your search for answers, without giving any indication that it might me HER story etc.
Maybe she will come up with an idea where you botch feel comfortable with.

Another thing I want to ensure you, is that you are NOT responsible for her mental well being. You are only responsible for your actions within the relationship you have (in this friendship it's likely trust and upheld your end of the deal to not mention her name/identity in any way with others).

Take it slow. There will be an enormous mountain of healing for her to deal with. You can be like a road sign for her. Let her know you are there to help, *within* your capabilities. 

I hope I've answered some of your questions, feel free to elaborate if I didn't catch some of your initial post.

I think that because your dad is a therapist, he would be a perfect person to speak to.

Your english is fine as far as I can tell, it's not my first either :P. Thank you for your kind response! A lot of which you recommended we luckily already talked about. She told me of ways to help her and I told her if she needs anything or if she finds a new way of support she can let me know. Right now it's mostly creating a safe space and meeting either in a group of at least 3 or at her place (we want to try if a more familiar space is better). The good thing is that the other people we could include in our hangouts are either aware too or are used to hang with us so it wouldn't be weird for them if we asked. She also offered ME the opportunity to talk with her if this thing does affect me more than I initially thought which is very nice of her and I think that way we can always be on the same page. I think I will ask her if its ok if i talk about it with someone I trust without disclosing too much because even though I can talk to her about it, I think I also want to talk with someone else too since it's already hard for her and she needs to focus on herself first	BackfischBoys	follow-up	na	na	na	0.006395689211785793	weak	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"First of all: your communication with your friend is top notch, you are both exploring limits and finding ways to reflect on it.

I don't like to tell that some people need those skills, but hopefully just by you doing it, will inspire others as well.

Ok√©, here's something more on topic - I think you are doing fine. And yes, share your concerns with others with as less exposure of her identity.
Maybe you can share your thoughts and feelings/dealings with all of it in a way that is.. How do I say it? ..Less walking-around-eggshells-feelings? 

With someone else, you can fully express YOUR share without carefully choosing words. That may be just as liberating as well. 

I'm glad that she mentioned that you can always talk to her, and that you can tell her if/when it is taking a toll on you. In my experience, I also said those things to others. 

Most of my friends at the time honored my wiches and the communication stayed open. Some of them (sadly) had a big running mouth, but no honorable actions. This led me to shut doors and building up walls even more. Yeah.. It's a tough game learning to trust again when someone has been violated.

But hey, that's part of my story. Hers would probably be different, 'cause we are all different.

Please continue this friendship with all your values that underlined it, and I think you are both helping each other by accepting each other's process and limits. And maybe just sitting next to each other in silence is golden. Or just time spending not mentioning 'the elephant in the room', so she can escape her mind for a bit. Just ask her needs, and how that specifically looks like for her. 

Maybe another Redditor will have some other insights, recommendations, tips, etc for your original post. I bet she's proud and happy to have you as a friend.

Emotional healing is a lot of hard work, it's not this picture perfect aesthetic I was sold by many wellness influences. It's far from linear and honestly can be so turbulent.

Hi all,

I am currently recruiting for my Masters of Clinical Psychology research project at Federation University Australia. We are looking in to the impact of childhood experiences on memory for literacy and numeracy. 

The survey does not contain any noxious content, but does ask some brief yes/no questions about certain childhood experiences which may be triggering. Helpline (if in Australia) and online support resources (if international) are listed throughout the study.

I've had crippling depression/anxiety since an event in 2011. I've done a ton of therapy some better than others. I'm not grieving anymore. Don't dwell on things. But it broke my brain. I'm on 3 different meds and really the only thing they accomplish is to help me make it through the work day (barely). They don't really take anything away, just make it tolerable. To do anything, I have to psych myself up and plan everything down to the last detail at least a day ahead of time. If anything doesn't go according to plan, it throws everything out of whack and I can't do anything. I stumbled across a place locally that does micro dosing IV ketamine. The process has gotten good reviews and supposedly has a 88% effective rate for treating depression. But the thought of an addiction on top of everything else scares the shit out of me. I wouldn't be able to handle it. Does anyone have any personal experience with this therapy? You or someone you know?	taquitosensei	post	32.63290719000017	female	White	0.9986132383346558	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"30 minutes ago, I (12m) had my worst panic attack ever. I was with my friend playing on playstation through, and I was chatting with him through playstation party. He was busy doing something else when my panic attack started, but after a while, I messaged him, saying I was having a panic attack, to which he quickly got back.

After about 5 minutes of talking to him,  my emotions built up to a hundred. I began making loud crying noises every time I took a breath. Like yelling-crying. I had taken off my headphones and paced out of the room (luckily, I was home alone). 
My hands felt numb, and my body was shaking, and my breaths were short and quick.

I cooled off after about 10 minutes and had set my headphones back on to chat with him. He is supportive and knows of my trauma, and after like 20 minutes, we stopped chatting, and now I'm writing this because I feel so ashamed to have him have heard my panic and pent up emotions. It was really intense, and I'm generally not an emotional dude.

I know I shouldn't feel embarrassed, but I do. I can't help it but feel ashamed and embarrassed. It was bad."	Responsible_Link_635	post	19.658847909262867	male	White	0.9979897737503052	na	na	na	6	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"**Part 1:** [**EMDR and CPTSD: Some Basic Terms, Concepts, and Techniques**](https://www.reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/12jswna/emdr_and_cptsd_some_basic_terms_concepts_and/)

**Part 2:** [**EMDR: Introduction to Safety and Resourcing**](https://www.reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/12wu0u3/emdr_introduction_to_safety_and_resourcing/)

**Part 3: EMDR & Related Sources and Links**

**Introduction**

In this post, I want to start a list of sources (general theory, specific protocols, etc) in case anyone else finds them useful. I'll add to this list as I find/rediscover relevant material. It will be quite short to start with, as I want to skip ahead to a post on targeting/processing as soon as possible & also finish a side-project report on the BFF technique (Best Foot Forward, linked below).

I can't guarantee that the links will remain active, or that I will be able to replace the ones taken down. If something looks potentially useful, maybe best to save it just in case.

If anyone has something they want to nominate for this list (articles, blogs, books they've read and are willing to to do a short review for, etc), please let me know.

Some of this literature may be triggering in various ways (case studies can be quite graphic, and industry-standard attitudes and language may, at times, be invalidating, reductionist, or otherwise unpleasant), so please proceed with caution.

**Specific Protocols & Techniques**

**-Constant Installation of Present Orientation and Safety (CIPOS)** ([https://compassionworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/21.-the-method-of-cipos.pdf](https://compassionworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/21.-the-method-of-cipos.pdf)) Possibly one of my favorite techniques, especially early on, CIPOS is all about touching very briefly on a disturbance & then quickly reorienting to the present. It's great practice and can make things much easier and safer during actual processing. However, as alluded to by the author, activating dissociated parts during this exercise can make things significantly more tricky, so it's not risk-free.

**-LOUA and ‚ÄúWhat's good about...‚Äù** ([https://emdrtherapyvolusia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Jim-Knipes-LOUA-and-Whats-Good-About-Procedures.pdf](https://emdrtherapyvolusia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Jim-Knipes-LOUA-and-Whats-Good-About-Procedures.pdf)) Techniques for directly targeting defenses and avoidance. ‚ÄúWhat's good about...‚Äù in particular is something I use frequently. Resistance is always there for a reason, and targeting it directly is a great way to find out what those reasons are & get a sense of what sort of circumstances/resources might allow them to relent.

**-Ego State Protocol** ([https://emdrtherapyvolusia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ego\_State\_Protocol.pdf](https://emdrtherapyvolusia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ego_State_Protocol.pdf)) A parts-work approach to select resources and facilitate resource-sharing and improved cooperation between parts. I've never used this protocol precisely, but I have done variations of it.

**-Floatback and Float-forward** ([https://emdrtherapyvolusia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Floatback\_and\_Float.pdf](https://emdrtherapyvolusia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Floatback_and_Float.pdf)) Floatback is a way to target recent trauma-based disturbances (emotional flashbacks, nightmares, etc) and then bridge back to the relevant memories for processing. Invaluable for when a person doesn't initially know the source of their present difficulties. However, as ever, structural dissociation can add some layers of complication. For example, some memories or aspects of memories may be contained by parts who are not yet willing or able to cooperate, and they may become activated during this technique. Another potential complication is if the selected recent disturbance involves several different contributing clusters of difficulty, and targeting it activates too many different things at once. Separating out good, distinct targets for processing is an entire art-form in itself, so more on that later.

**-Two-Handed Interweave**  ([https://emdr-podcast.com/episode-10-two-handed-interweave/](https://emdr-podcast.com/episode-10-two-handed-interweave/)) Useful in all sorts of situations, especially when navigating internal conflict. By anchoring each perspective to either hand and switching attention back and forth between them (simply observing without attempting to argue or judge), a fuller picture of the difficulty emerges and can sometimes spontaneously resolve if the conditions are right.

**-Best Foot Forward** ([https://emdrtherapyvolusia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Put\_Your\_Best\_Foot\_Forward-Overview\_Paper.pdf](https://emdrtherapyvolusia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Put_Your_Best_Foot_Forward-Overview_Paper.pdf)) A resourcing intervention, this is a very fascinating way to use somatic (bodily) cues to prime the selection and integration of resources. It can also be a safer way to begin experimenting with bilateral stimulation, giving a person practice in using these methods to navigate various mental states, which is a resource in and of itself. I'm currently trying this for a particular anxiety state which has been especially tricky for me in the past. I'm keeping notes to make a post about it when I'm done, and will link to it in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSDFreeze/comments/13c8oo3/bff_possibly_useful_technique_for_freeze_states/) if anyone is interested.

**-Loving Eyes Protocol** ([https://emdrtherapyvolusia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Loving\_Eyes\_Protocol.pdf](https://emdrtherapyvolusia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Loving_Eyes_Protocol.pdf)) A parts-work approach for improving relations & decreasing avoidance between adult and younger parts (slightly longer explanation here: [https://connect.springerpub.com/highwire\_display/entity\_view/node/94458/content\_details](https://connect.springerpub.com/highwire_display/entity_view/node/94458/content_details)).

**-EMDR and RDI** ([https://www.emdrworks.org/Downloads/EMDR%20and%20RDI%20(Korn).pdf](https://www.emdrworks.org/Downloads/EMDR%20and%20RDI%20(Korn).pdf)) This article discusses Resource Development and Installation (RDI) in the context of CPTSD. It also includes the basic protocol for resource development and installation.

**-Affect Circuit Resetting** ([https://greenhousecenter.org/wpbb/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/EMDR-Handouts.pdf](https://greenhousecenter.org/wpbb/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/EMDR-Handouts.pdf)) Affect Circuit Resetting is, apart from anything else, a really interesting way to target things at a conceptual level. Although the focus of this protocol is usually on emotions/action systems (fight/flight/fawn/freeze/etc), you can technically use it on just about anything. It does require pretty good affect management (containment especially). Despite the emphasis on not triggering traumatic material, this is much easier said than done (I had to stop very frequently for grounding/containment while trying this). That said, when successful, I find it lets me look at just about any difficulty I'm having in a very distanced, metaphorical way without triggering personal defenses. For the original purpose (re:emotions), I did find it significantly easier to identify different emotional states after doing this exercise. Note: this handout is not the one I used. I liked the other version better, but can't currently find it.

**Misc**

**-Argument for Modifying the Standard Protocol** ([https://www.eomega.org/sites/default/files/resources/standard\_protocol\_time\_to\_move\_on.pdf](https://www.eomega.org/sites/default/files/resources/standard_protocol_time_to_move_on.pdf)) Most sources/protocols you find will use the language and metrics of the original standard protocol (SUDs, VOC, etc). This approach can arguably sometimes become rigid, distracting, and over-complicated depending on what a person is working on. On the other hand, without understanding what different elements mean and what is meant to be happening during processing, changing too much can lead to very disorganized/ineffective approaches. The author of this paper cites Laurel Parnell's modified approach to EMDR (which allows for a much more straightforward and flexible approach to processing without sacrificing anything which makes EMDR effective). I've been using a variation of this for years, with good results and lot fewer headaches than the standard protocol.

**Books:**

**-EMDR Toolbox: Theory and Treatment of Complex PTSD and Dissociation**   One of my most-recommended, this book is a great place to start because it directly discusses and addresses many of the unique challenges in using EMDR in the context of CPTSD. The author, Jim Knipe, is the creator of both the CIPOS and ‚ÄúWhat's good about...‚Äù techniques, as well as several others.

**-A Therapist's Guide to EMDR: Tools and Techniques for Successful Treatment** While I might quibble a bit about some of the author's stances (re:therapeutic relationship, stabilization phase, medication, etc), this book is a highly readable and very straightforward breakdown of the various aspects of EMDR, how/why to augment them depending on circumstances, and also contains a really solid section on targeting."

"So I could only put one flair, I think, so I'm also going to list TRIGGER WARNING, VENTING and SEEKING SUPPORT here as well. 


So recently, I've noticed that my mental state has changed recently and not for the better. I've always struggled with depression, and traits of PTSD after my trauma but I've always generally tried to be a positive person. I've been seeing a trauma specialist but recently my job laid me off, and I lost my insurance so I don't really have anyone else to talk to. On top of this, my partner of 10 years and I recently broke up and tried to stay friends. But just recently they told me, they'd rather we just be strangers. On top of that, they're taking their name off the lease and leaving me with a 1,300 dollar rent apartment and no job to pay for it completely by myself. 

I'm trying to so hard to stay positive, but I just can't. How can I, my life has been hell from that start and I can't take it anymore. 

Growing up, I grew up watching my mother with BPD drown herself in pills, cocaine and alcohol. Because we were poor, none of my friends wanted to come over because they were afraid that ""the rats would make them sick"" and in the third grade I was sexually assaulted by a 5th grade boy. It was through this fucked up event I discovered I'm bisexual. 

After my parents divorced, I lived with my dad and his parents. My grandparents who were crazy Catholic fiercely forced their religion on my brother and I. But their religion didn't stop them from physically, emotionally, and sexually abusing us. My grandfather would often watch us shower, and drag me out of the truck by my ankle if it took me too long to exit. By the time I was in middle school, I was struggling so hard with my sexuality and gender identity I was certain I was going to hell. Luckily though, most of my grandparents mistreatment was aimed at my brother who was going through his own mental health crisis. 

Unfortunately, for me though, that meant he took his frustrations and anger at them out on me instead often using their ""favoritism"" of me as an excuse. My brother often smashed my head into windows, choked me, beat me, and would torture me with knives or other sharp objects he found around the house, or would push me down at water fountains saying only he got to drink first. 

(To this day he says it was just a game to him, but it wasn't for me. He's also recently been diagnosed with psychopathy and has now spent some time in jail for assault)

But it didn't matter how much he abused me, he was the only person I could count on, when it came to us against my grandparents. 

After some time, my brother and I managed to excape my grandparents, and move in with my mom. She's still not great, but she's definitely getting better. I'm actually proud of her. 

So after all this, I ended up dropping out of highschool, and just becoming a hermit because of how little I trusted people. It wasn't until I met my now ex, that I started opening up and trying to change. Get therapy, depression meds, etc. 

But now after 10 years, all of that is in the toilet and honestly I'm not sad, I'm angry and that's what scares me. 

I'm so fucking angry at the world, and everyone around me, and people for just being people. I hate myself, so I've recently been h*rting myself again and I've recently started purposely getting into risky relationships with strangers with just the hope that maybe something will happen to me, and I can just disappear. 

I'm tired of all of this. I have nothing left. I'm sitting here in the dark all alone writing this because my ex took the fucking lights."	AcceptableAd9075	post	19.723347858795155	female	White	0.9970912933349609	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	failed

"I don't regularly have panic attacks. I'll have them at most 3 times a year, and they're never really triggered by anything specific. It's often a build of emotion and stressful circumstance, then maybe just being pushed over by something small, my last one being asked to write out a study timetable since exams are fast approaching.

I have constant disassociation and emotional dampening to the point that it's like I'm not real and I feel nothing. Not much bothers me and I care very little about most things. I'm utterly neutral and I could describe my emotional state as a shrug most of the time. I can feel emotion obviously and I have interests and hobbies, but regardless of if I'm feeling anything there's always that buzz of nothing playing in the back of my head, like seeing myself having fun through glass.

One thing I've found though, usually as I begin to come down from a panic attack, is how preferential that place is to the utter nothing I feel most days. I'll be noticing I'm coming down from it and instead of relief I just feel depressed.

I immediately miss the crying and screaming and the sick feeling in my stomach because in that moment I am alive, as painful as it is. Finally, I can hear myself. And then the silence creeps back in and there's nothing again.

I'd never really noticed this before as I'd never had a panic attack that wasn't public to some degree, so as I came down I was usually just left with the feeling of embarrassment or agitation at the usually poor or exasperated response by those I'm with at the time, so I never really would notice myself slipping back into the nothing.

But my last time I had a panic attack, I was alone. I was attempting to work and was too scared to stop working to seek help or comfort, but I kept writing down what I was feeling as a kind of compromise. This is the first time I noticed it. 

I'm wondering if anyone else feels this way about panic attacks?"	YourLocalCryptidNE	post	21.56446340948493	female	White	0.6940035820007324	na	na	na	2	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

I‚Äôve definitely felt this way about meltdowns and breakdowns before (my panic attacks tend to be very dramatic and scary). I used to repress pretty much all emotion but meltdowns, breakdowns, and post-panic attacks are expressive and can be cathartic in a way. I typically look at it as away form my body to overrule me and say ‚ÄúNo. We need to feel this emotion and you will do it now!‚Äù	YourLocalCryptidNE	reply	na	na	na	0.6940035820007324	no	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"My parents and me and my brother used to share a room till i was 12ish
We used to sleep on the sofa cum bed and they on the main bed
I think they forgot we were there when they were drunk and they used to have sex right there infront of us for hours
I couldn't sleep
I've watched them doing everything nasty and they didn't even cared to be quiet
In the morning my father would ask if i watched the movie like it was something i enjoyed
I am 18 now and have lots of fetishes and sex addiction and i can't remive the mental image of my parents having sex 
I don't kbow what to do
I am trying to stay celibate for a year
It's been 16 days

Hey there. Thanks so much for having the courage and compassion for yourself to seek support. Good first step. It‚Äôs trauma no doubt and those energies and early impressions contribute to your impressions of sex now. You can go back in time and work with these experiences with the support of a trauma or PTSD trained therapist. That‚Äôs an essential here for processing what a child wasn‚Äôt able to, and to realign the deeper authenticity of your more mature being without the trap of the trauma keeping a hold on you. I‚Äôve found IFS internal family systems to be a very direct and practical way of getting results from therapy without years of talking. But it‚Äôs different for everyone. If your first experiences with therapy aren‚Äôt helpful, keep searching bc there are amazing therapists out there and it takes time to find the right one. It also takes time to tell if it‚Äôs working so jumping therapist to therapist after one session prob won‚Äôt be ideal either. Best advice from someone who doesn‚Äôt know your entire story: find someone trained in IFS, sexual abuse, and PTSD. That could be the grand slam. If you have a history of severe trauma, depression, psych concerns (schizophrenia, psychosis, etc.) a psychiatrist is perhaps the first best step. (This isn‚Äôt medical advice.)		reply	na	na	na	0.9969684481620789	weak	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

That is extreme abuse. It‚Äôs not your fault and you can recover and heal. I‚Äôm not judging whether you have any sort of addiction from what you said but from personal experience the 12 step group Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous (SLAA) is very helpful for connecting with other people who also have lots to process and work through and heal from. You can do phone and online meetings for it if there aren‚Äôt in person ones in your town. It might be a good entry point for connecting with others about difficult topics and finding resources for safe housing and other kinds of support if and when you need it.		follow-up	na	na	na	0.9969684481620789	weak	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"I'm really sorry to hear about your experience. It sounds like a deeply distressing situation that you've been carrying with you for a long time. It's important to acknowledge that what you witnessed as a child was not appropriate or healthy. It's understandable that it has had an impact on your mental well-being and feelings about intimacy.

I would strongly encourage you to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor who specializes in trauma and sexual issues. They can provide you with the support and guidance you need to address the effects of your past experiences and work towards healing. Talking to a professional can also help you navigate your feelings, manage any addiction issues, and develop healthier coping mechanisms.

I would recommend reaching out to [RAINN](https://www.rainn.org) or other mental health hotlines local to you, you should be able to ask them for a list of free or low-cost resources in your area; even if you just call them to talk with one of their volunteers when you feel like you need support. Another thing you might find useful is going to a sex addicts anonymous meeting; I know that both of these options can be nerve-racking but from your other comments, I know that cost is a factor and these are the best free resources that I know of that could potentially benefit you as soon as you‚Äôre ready to take that step.

"Basically I was on YouTube during it's ""wild west"" time where there was hardly any regulations (early 2000s). I clicked on an 18+ only video, it said ""mature people only"" and I thought I was mature enough as an 8 or 9 year old to watch it.
So I watched it. And I couldn't stop myself from watching it. Once I clicked play it was over. 
I watched an extremely pornographic, rape video before the age of 10.

I don't have flashbacks from the situation, but I do remember it vividly and I remember crying in the shower for weeks until I told my parents while watching The Amazing Spider Man 2 (now I can't watch that movie without thinking about the situation).
I was too young to see such a thing.
I didn't even know what to properly call it, I told my parents I had watched a ""rap"" video. I couldn't even properly pronounce ""rape"" as I had never heard it before.


I hate how the rest of my life is now predicated by something I clicked on as a naive child."	YeeYee-203	post	17.63301101773894	female	White	0.9970034956932068	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"My mother pinched my butt, *hard*, ''playfully'' for all the years I lived with her. I begged her to stop from as young as I can remember. As an adult,  she eventually told be that by seven years old I asked her to never touch me again, so she stopped hugging me and being gentle and kind out of spite, but never stopped poking, prodding, pinching, and sometimes even slapping or dragging me. I forgot I asked this request, but i noticed the lack of love.


I remember her doing other things when I was young (under 7) that I don't want to get into here.


Would this alone constitute sexual and physical abuse? It has carried over into my day to day life and is definitely a trauma. I get anxious with anyone approaching me around the kitchen because she used to trap me there and pinch me on my butt. I like my partner touching my butt, but  often have to work against a trauma response. Its taken a long time. There's other stuff too but again it feels too vulnerable or inappropriate to share.


Guess I just want to make sure I am not crazy for thinks that this happened and that it is sexual and physical assult/abuse. I completely overlooked the fact any of it happened for so, so long so I think I am trying to come to terms with small things to I can look at the other stuff, too."	cnfsdgythrwy	post	31.22311639837256	male	White	0.9903566241264343	na	na	na	8	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

Whether or not it was meant to be sexual on her part, it seems that it felt like sexual violation to you and that's really important. And I do feel that denying a child love and comfort, and then constantly poking and prodding at them in painful ways to be abusive. The way you described it, it seems like she completely denied you agency over your own body, and constantly violated your consent. I can't imagine intentionally hurting a child like that.

"You don't need to talk about them with friends but it is important to release them. This can be accomplished a lot of ways. Sometimes we can just actively choose to relax when they come up and release them right away. Some things bounce around inside and want to be acknowledged by the brain.. the ones that cause a lot of thoughts in the brain are worth expressing for the sake of getting those thoughts out of you so you can stop focusing on them and the feeling associated there with.

But there are ways to do that that don't involve talking to friends. In fact I would ONLY talk to someone who understands how to validate emotions and won't try to talk you out of feeling the way you do or respond with their own story etc... Validation looks like ""I can understand why you would feel that way"" and similar responses. Even ""your emotional response seems valid to me"" anything like that is validation. It has to do with having compassion  for the person in distress. If you find the people you speak to are failing in this department it can invalidate your emotions and it can actually be counterproductive and cause you to dig in deeper to holding onto the emotion.

If you have no one to validate, don't talk to other people. This is where journaling is extremely useful. When you write down  your thoughts about what happened and how it makes you feel, you get it out of your head and give yourself validation that it's legitimate to feel the way you do. This will allow you to more easily let go of the feeling and let it pass through as it is meant to."	ByeByeBiGuy	reply	na	na	na	0.9993355870246887	no	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"I don't know how I'll ever be okay again. I was so scared that who I am would ruin the first true friend group I've had in 31 years. It did, in large part because I was so positive it was going to happen eventually. She said it isn't permanent, but I'll never forget this, and I can't imagine how I will ever feel okay again. 

My deepest wish is to be forgotten. It's also my deepest fear, but I want the world to forget I was ever here. To be removed from all memory and dissolve into a trillion atoms that spread so far from one another that no two pieces of myself will so much as meet before the heat death of the universe. I want to leave no trace. 

I'm not at risk of hurting myself, because I wouldn't just disappear from memory and I won't hurt my family like that. 

Perhaps one day, if I try hard every day, I can fold myself into the smallest possible version of myself. I won't hurt anyone or demand anything. I will simply exist in the background like a picture on the wall that is pleasing and suits the decor, but is so unobtrusive as to become invisible."	mustnttelllies	post	13.608298516725288	female	White	0.9940487146377563	na	na	na	3	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

Before I had kids I‚Äôd keep minimal food around and plan everything day by day. But now I have to constantly keep food on hand so my kids can eat whenever they are hungry. The snacks are so tempting when I feel the need to binge. I also worry about not being able to model a healthy relationship with food for them. At some point they are going to catch on that my lack of appetite or my uncontrollable appetite is not normal.	breezeboo	post	20.345704476403135	female	White	0.9904395341873169	na	na	na	2	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"I apologize for making suggestions w/o any resources to share but I would make researching how to raise children with healthy relationships to food my hobby. Look for journal or popular (whatever you're more comfortable w) articles by dieticians and child psychologists who seem to have trustworthy perspectives. Mentions of HAES is a positive indicator. If you have access & any trouble arises in their eating patterns my niece has had some help from occupational therapists. Maybe talking to a trustworthy dietitian could help if you haven't already. There are some good Instagram accounts out there that focus on this subject I wish I didn't delete the app so I could share the ones I was following. r/fuckeatingdisorders is a decent sub where there could be people w some resources & advice. I see that you follow some neurodivergent focused subs so also here's r/ARFID if you weren't aware/it could have any use. Having children involved in meal making is suggested a lot.

[I haven't listened to this but Christy has a good reputation from what I've seen.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/christyharrison.com/foodpsych/4/building-body-positive-families-hilary-kinavey%3fformat=amp)

When I was helping my niece I remember one thing I read was the caregiver provides the food & the child decides of what from that & how much they eat. Never or almost never use force or shaming, there are no bad or good foods (even to the point of dessert isn't more special or any different than rest of meal); talk about how all food gives us energy in different ways & have it's different uses, we should reflect on how food makes our body feel and our enjoyment of it.

 I think it's perfectly healthy to have age appropriate discussions about whatever conditions/illnesses family members have. Hopefully you are doing absolutely everything in your power to manage your symptoms & your children are a big motivator for that but since we can't have complete control when we are ill then talking out in the open leaves less room for it to have a big effect on their own behavior and feelings. You can even occasionally talk about your struggles & what you are doing to help yourself as long as it's limited & you're not giving them the responsibility of caring for you.

If you feel the need to binge/find yourself binging/have frequent thoughts of food that's an indication that you are restricting (either food in general or specific nutrients) & your body is trying to tell you it needs you to nourish it.

I'm sorry if anything I've said is triggering or unhelpful. This is all what I currently believe from my research and life experiences. That's awesome that you care and are being so proactive."	breezeboo	reply	na	na	na	0.9904395341873169	weak	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"Although I know I should be happy that it appears nice people are coming into my life, but when they contact me or try to hold a conversation with me I get really triggered and struggle (today I‚Äôve procrastinated, typed and retyped a message multiple times out of fear). 

I genuinely want to let people in as I get quite lonely at times but I don‚Äôt know how to navigate these situations and I just shut down (especially considering when I was at school I missed a lot of it due to my situation so the social cues that are automatic to some are not to me).

I know that what is good and comfortable can be triggering as it‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm used to due to suffering from a lot of abuse and recently having to cut some more unpleasant people out all over again. 

However, I wanted to know if anyone had any advice or experience with not shutting out good things but also progressing through them in a way that‚Äôs actually sustainable and less likely to leave you in an anxious heap."

I've found both medication to help my depression and anxiety has been very helpful and a therapist who is trained in trauma. It's not easy but it's worth it ‚ù§Ô∏è hope this helps you in taking your next steps in healing.	SweetCarolinebabadah	reply	na	na	na	0.9946138262748718	weak	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"I started with something so simple, yet so damn powerful it's changed everything. Writing about it.
I kept writing about everything that hurt me, every thing I went through. I let myself feel the anger, grief, pain, shame of it all. Trauma are emotions we've suppressed. This is not a comfortable process, but once you've let yourself feel it - you unlock a new level of lightness everytime. After a while, without realizing - you just start smiling again.
However, it takes work - you have to really want it and it's a constant process. It's not about being 'healed', but to heal enough to stop coping, healed enough to start discovering who you are before the trauma, to return back to your self.

I wish you well."	SweetCarolinebabadah	reply	na	na	na	0.9946138262748718	no	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"This is just for venting/journaling. 

May be stupid or not, but I've been having panic attacks three nights in a row because of my childhood trauma and of the anxiety I'm having to deal with when just going outside. So, today I decided to buy some beer because I already know I'll have an episode tonight so what better decision to get drunk! Two days ago, the episode was bad. Voices telling me to do things, lokking at myself in a very negative way, wanting to hurt my arm because it wouldn't stop shaking, my mind was at least happy when it made to drink 2 shots, which, sure, I regretted it, but my mind was pleased and the episode stopped shortly after.

I'm not an alcoholic at all, but sometimes I want to have a drink or two. Now, I want to get drunk and I am going to get drunk."	Responsible_Link_635	post	26.389040920231995	male	White	0.021435782313346863	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

6 years back i was on public transit with my family and a man restrained me and sexually assaulted me before running out the doors when they opened. My family reacted very poorly as did the rest of the passengers. I don‚Äôt blame my family but at times i wish we could address the situation at all. I‚Äôve only brought it up 4 times since then and it results in massive fighting. Or just shutting down and not talking to me at all, crying and overwhelmed etc. It was upsetting to me at the time and still very much is but it makes me feel very isolated and broken that this is how people are reacting to something that I can‚Äôt control. How can I fix this with my family, i want support that doesn‚Äôt make them feel like i‚Äôm accusing them. I know they likely feel guilty but I wish they wouldn‚Äôt so they could be there for me? I cant even mention it in passing without massive blow up reactions. I want people to act normally so I can feel healed from this because I feel okay about it now. Especially since they were there i‚Äôd appreciate their perspective and for them to confirm my reality etc since it was so confusing. Any advice at all or is it just like this?

"Most people can't deal with the trauma of others because then they have to experience their own limitations and powerlessness

No one likes doing that because then they also experience their own vulnerability

Instead as possible seek professional help because they are trained to help you understand your reactions and your family's 

A very common reaction is to go on as if nothing has happened rather than experiencing the pain of what did happen

You can always get comforting brain chemicals by hugging a pillow or hugging or playing with a stuffed toy or pet 

Also writing or talking softly to a pet or favourite toy can be helpful because they do witness but never judge or turn away"	HelenLovesYou	reply	na	na	na	0.9982499480247498	no	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"They sound emotionally unavailable. :( forcing your silence for the sake of their fragile comfort is not an expression of love, conscious choice or not.

I find that, if you really want to, explaining what they‚Äôre doing with the full intention of not accepting their false povs/giving space and time and then accepting changes of heart/growth without asking for blame or long term accountability can result in them being on the same page‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúwin,‚Äù and may not end up being worth it.

"This is also not a trollpost this is truly and honestly what happend in my life

&#x200B;

I will start by saying this will be a long story.  
It is my story that i later want to make into a video but i want to share it here and get the redditors reaction.

  
I also have to mention that a lot of my past and growing up i can not remember , probably i have removed many instances from my memory .

  
Hi i am Ama M29 now , this story starts at age 6-7 where my parents where downstairs in the living area and had prepared food , i was playing at the top of the stairs with lego, my mom called me down so i cleaned up the lego and went down for food , my grandmother was lying in bed and was on the way to come down.

  
What really happend :: My grandmother fell out of bed sounding in a loud noise (hearthattack) then an ambulence came and she passed awey in the hospital.

  
What my mother told me (dad never knew about this until i was 24) :: I a 6-7 year old boy did not clean up my lego correctly causing my grandmother to slip on some lego on the stairs and causing her to fall down getting rushed to the hospital and passing awey at the hospital.

  
i dont think i have to explain what that does to a child  ,i felt horrible ""killing my grandmother , nightmares for years , doing terrible at school and so on.  
my parents divorced when i was 8-9 years oldwhen this happend my mother manipulated me with gifts and lies that i would choose to stay with her , this did happen and i grew up with her.  
After i moved with her she started manipulating me more telling how horrible and evil my dad is and i never believed it until some years of constant manipulation .  
some other stories from my time with my mother i will tell now.  
I was left alone at nights 4 times a week from age 9 , make my own food , take care of myself while she was off getting drunk everytime.

  
my mother would tell me weekly multiple times to go hang myself , kill myself , i am not her son , i dont deserve her as family and so on.

  
i became a closed book , scared of the world , my mother and others , school was a mess beeing bullied everyday come home crying then dealing with my mother , my life was a mess but i held on and survived.

  
at my 16th birthday my uncle gave me 10.000euro that he had saved for me for my future , my mom put it on my bank account  which she also had acces to , she put the money on there and a week latershe took it all off stealing all my money including my work money 15.000 euro +...  
never saw that money again.

  
there are many more stories with my mom alone but i will go on to the next part.  
my mother also got a girlfriend  who became her wife later , i will call that person G.  
G was a evil person same as my mother , G would abuse my mother and myself , she once trew my mother down the stairs , would trow me against walls if i would get less then a 7/10 on my tests for school (by this time i am around the age of 11-13) there is a story where i was sitting in the sofa and i heard the ice cream truck coming , i asked my mom if i could get a icecream , she said yes , i wanted to run outside and G stopped me , she then took my money told me i could not get a icecream then she went outside bought herself an icecream and sat next to me eating it telling me to deal with it and stop crying.

  
also the parent of G told me that they would give me up for adoption cause everyone tought i was a waste of space , i only ruin the happyness of my mom and G and they told me that they also agreed with it and wanted to give me up for adoption.  
another story is that we went to a fair in a big city , i was about 12-13 at the time and ofcourse beeing young and happy to be there after some rides we got in the car to leave , i myself enjoying myself and beeing young was complaining and begging to stay a bit longer where when we drove for about 1.5km she slammed the breaks G stepped out of the car grabbed me by the arm and threw me out telling me if i wanted to stay be our guest and they drove off leaving me alone in a dark streets with no lights for about 15 minutes before returning , in those 15 minutes a old man appeared talking to me he asked me if i wanted to come with him, i said no and by this time he grabbed my arm and started pulling me into an alley and by luck at that time my mom and G drove up again honking their horn , the man ran awey . they told me to get in and i did not say a word to anyone for weeks, yet another trauma to add to the book..

  
my dad did not know about these things cause i told nobody , i couldnt , i was terrified.  
and the one story that stays with me also a heavy one is where G was downstairs telling me i had to go upstairs to my mom ( i was age 13 +-) so i went upstairs to the bathroom where G said my mom was so i walked in and what i saw was my mom with a plastic bag around her head holding her head under the full bath of water.

  
i pulled her out and she started yelling and screaming at me , "" this is all your foult , you did this to me , its cause of you i want to die , you never listen to me , i wish you would die ""and so on  
(my hands are trembling , i can feel my hearth beat out of my chest as i am typing this..)  
when i came out as gay , my dad was extremely understanding (age14) also reastablished the relationship a bit with my dad at that time ( i cant explain how horrible i felt about not having him in my life , more about that later)

  
my mom on the otherhand beeing a lesbian aswell , she was furious , same old  thing ""kill yourself , trash and so on and so on)  
many years pass of the same mental abuse till i was 17-18 still living at my mom  and relation with dad was better , i stayed over at his place and all that , he learned about some of the things i been through at that time , spended more time there , till this day even i knoz it was not my foult i feel extremely guilty and horrible about basically my dad not expierencing me grow up .

  
my dad told me many times ""its not your foult"" i know.. but it feels like it is , if i was stronger i could of stood up but i was weak from all the mental abuse and manipulation that went on from age 8-18 by my mother.

  
so at age 16-17 i met this older guy a gay guy he was maybe 24 , we went on a vacation also had intercourse multiple times , since i never received love from my mother i found it with gay men who where much older then me.. only way i felt loved i had intercourse with men from 20-45.. cause they made me feel loved , ofcourse they only wanted sex ( this started at age 15)  but after that vacation this guy said i dident have to pay anything so i did not , after a while he also became manipulating and together with my mom they instilled fear in me by meating at our house and him and my mom telling me they where both going to sew me for not paying my share for the vacation.

  
ofcourse they never did sew me this was just a way that they wanted to keep me as this guys boyfriend  , that i would become to scared to leave.. i was 16 at the time he was 24-26 at that time cause my mom said he was a good guy.. mhm..sure ...

  
years pass after that chapter was closed and i meet this kind guy who talked with me and helped me i was 18 he was 22 , i fell inlove...biggest mistake i ever made...

  
he was sweet kind at the beginning , he drank some alcohol sure no problem..

  
lets call this ex stan.

  
stan found out how my mother treated me and after a year he dragged me awey from there , out of that hellhole with that evil women that was and is my mom.

  
not realizing i was beeing dragged to a new hellhole..

  
when i left mom sold the house whish normally was going to be shared between my dad , her and myself , i was supposed to get 1/3rd of it but against she stole everything at the time beeing 460.000 euro and she spent it all in a year and a half on alcohol and buying strangers drinks in bar's...  
stan lived with hes parents and brother who had asperger syndrome.

  
So i moved with him there and this is were everything went to shit.. i got a job and everything , stan did drugs , weed mainly and hes alcohol problem got worse and worse at hes place he would also start manipulating me telling me how he saved me and now i owe him.

  
stan started drinking from some beers to a sixpack a day but he gained a lot of weight cause of it i myself weighed at that time 51 kg and i was 1.69cm , he was 1.75cm and weighed probably around 80-95kg he could easily overpower me if he wanted to.

  
(I am feeling physically sick at this point re-living these stories)  
but that cause hes beers to become vodka cause he wouldnt gain much weight from liquor.  
it started with 1/4th bottle a day ..to half a bottle.. to a full bottle of vodka a day , he was drunk everyday started mentally abusing me aswell same as my mom did , he did suicide attempts i always saved him ..i was a prisoner i couldnt escape ,  i was stuck.. i started smoking weed just to survive so i was out of this world .

  
stan also had a fantasy of raping people..when we had intercourse i would almost always cry from pure pain when he ..raped me everytime against my will , i would be crying while he had sex with me , holding down my body and wrists with hes full weight..

  
i could not do anything.. i felt lost and alone..

  
noone knew about this at the time .

  
he had this friend group who did xtc , coke and everything else , stan manipulated me into doing those drugs aswell where there is one instance i almost died from an overdose of XTC , 43 degrees celcius fever , hallucinating , overheating , shaking , the only reason i survived that is cause i stayed calm..

  
Stan or hes friends did not want to take me to the hospital , they rather saw me die then someone figuring out they had done drugs...

  
( i am trying my best to write it all down but it is extremely difficult , i will forget some parts in this story)

  
stan told me i had to steal money when i went to help out in my dads bar... and i did cause he left me no choice .

  
(years after everything passed i told my dad everything , he understood and forgave me for everything , he was broken to learn about it all and that i never told him , my dad is everything to me , he is and has always been my guardian angel )

  
years passed to where me and stan lived together , i would come home from work and if i say in a year i would find him looking dead on the ground 300 days a year , i am not lying , i was broken ,i was a shell , not a person , my mind and body was destroyed , i wished i would just fall dead on the spot...yet i still cared for stan i dont know why or how after everything he did and still do..

  
he almost was my downfall , years passed where he was going to marry me and 2 weeks before it happend at our home i was working in the bar , we lived above the bar cause me and stan where going to take it over from my dad.

  
stan was sick upstairs , i was sick downstairs doing 16 hours days for a month straight already, stan told me he quitted drinked and drugs.. i went to check on him many times cause he was sick..  
this is when i came upstairs i saw he was pissdrunk .. a bottle and half of vodka 150 grams of weedbutter (no clue we still had that) he was shitfaced , i finished work and came upstairs telling him this is not ok.. i was worried for him he also had gambled 2500 euro .. we had nothing left , he fell to the ground insulting me , crawling towards me and i saw in hes eyes he wanted to physically hurt me , i filmed him to show him how he was acting so i could show it the next days if he would sober up.  
he was able to stand up he walked towards me and for the first time in forever my gut reacting was to punch him full power into hes gut.

  
i was shocked i did it , it was a reaction , he looked at me with suprise and became enraged trowing chairs towards me at this point i ran into the bedroom and somehow with adrenaline i pushed a over 100-125KG closet (oaken closet) infront of the door , i called my dad in fear and panic , my dad dropped everything and rushed here to save me.

  
my dad arrived , stan calmed down , i told him what happend and since then i started realizing ...what am i doing with my life.. do i .. want to live like this and proboaly die because of this scumbag?  
the following week i myself cancelled the wedding , i told everyone about what had happend to me with stan and how he treated me , everyone took my side and protected me ,my dad and hes gf, my custumors  , my friends  , i finally was able to break the chains , i stood up to stan , and i stayed strong , i told him no i wont marry you , get out of my house , i want you out , i told the same to stans family told them the truth  but ofcourse they would not listen , i told them come pick him up get him out of here.   
i stood my ground after almost 6 years of abuse , rape , manipulation .

  
i was strong , i am strong and i could do it and i did do it , now its been 6 years since that happend  , i stopped smoking , drugs , i got an amazing boyfriend he is my world . 

  
my life is going great , i have no more contact with my mom for over 7 years now , my relation with my dad is amazingly strong , i love life i truly do.

  
i still have much to learn but i have learned a lot and will learn more.

"A very close friend of mine, also my roommate, was recently physically assaulted by a man with a pocket knife and was (shallowly) stabbed. They have lots of physical and emotional trauma in their history but seem to be dealing with the mental part pretty well given the circumstances. So my question is more about advice for the physical healing.

They cant go to their regular doctor because they dont want their family to find out about the assault (whole can of worms). 

They have neck and back pain as well as migraines, and have been dealing with very bad rib pain and shortness of breath for a few months. That was from being beaten as a child that deformed their ribs, as well as several concussions. Now on top of all of that they have a shallow stab wound on the abdomen and bruising all over their body buy especially on the ribs.

I cant do much in this situation, but being able to relieve their pain even a little I think could help them a lot to be able to focus on healing other areas.

For those curious: they have taken kickboxing and jui-jitsu and definitely severely broke his nose"	transoikawa	post	49.735010982329385	male	White	0.00475282222032547	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"A week ago to this day, I experienced what it feels like to be in fear of losing my life by someone else‚Äôs hand and I‚Äôm having a hard time coping.

Key Information:
- Assaulter is my partner‚Äôs aunt + landlord
- She had a habit of lovebombing me with food, clothing, and praise then the VERY next day would degrade me by calling me out of my name and screaming at me and shaming me for accepting anything she offered
- Created false situations or twisted what actually happened between one on one interactions to fit her narrative that I‚Äôm ungrateful and disrespectful 
- Would attempt to convince my partner that I have a malicious or manipulative intent
- It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I‚Äôve began recording our conversations to protect myself 
- At the time, lived with her, my partner, and two others
- Myself, assaulter, and one other person was present 
- Cops/legal action has not been taken yet
- I‚Äôm late 20‚Äôs F, USA
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

In the day of the assault, it was a seemingly normal day where I was doing my routine and keeping to myself. She came to my bedroom door and asked me to come sort through some clothes she‚Äôs going to donate and see if I wanted anything. We had planned to do this for a couple of weeks but life happened and we didn‚Äôt get to it. The night we were going to, she ended up taking a spontaneous trip out of state without telling me. Fast forward to last week, the second I sat down with her, she started to verbally berate me for not doing this with her sooner and claimed I was disrespectful to her time. I never talked back because I was genuinely in shock and knew it would fuel her further. It continued to escalate regardless and she began to say she would kill me and my dog. She went into detail how she would do it and that I would never be found. I was terrified and didn‚Äôt want to make eye contact as she got into my face and she claimed I was rolling my eyes. She then told me to sit on the couch as she walked to the kitchen and grabbed a butcher knife. She returned with it in my face, continuing to threaten me. I was in fear of my life as she was falsely accusing me of things while saying ‚Äúyou must want to die‚Äù. She had a physical therapy appointment happening 30m after the initial assault and that‚Äôs the only reason why it ended. 

There‚Äôs so much more to what happened but if he writing a novel. I‚Äôm genuinely just trying to cope with the intrusive feelings and memory of what happened and want to know if anyone has advice.

As far as legal action, that will be taken. I have a recording of the verbal threats she made and will be making a police report. 

I‚Äôm safe now and have moved out and have zero contact with her‚Ä¶ but I can barely sleep at night now. I was an insomniac before but this feels different. I think I‚Äôm still in shock, I feel numb while having bursts of sadness, anger, fear. I don‚Äôt want to harm myself or anyone else, but I want to viscerally destroy objects around me - but won‚Äôt ofc. I have this rage and deep sadness that I don‚Äôt know how to deal with and I need an outlet or something until I can go to a therapist. I know in my soul this has changed me as a person but I can‚Äôt yet tell how much. I have pre-existing PTSD from unrelated experiences throughout my life, so I fear my subconscious has swiftly taken this and buried it deep. I want to process it, but I can‚Äôt right now if that makes sense?

It‚Äôs messing me up because she has me feeling as if my lack of initiative on sorting through clothes with her was warranted to be treated this way. I know it‚Äôs not, but my brain has made that association. I already had anxiety towards how my actions affect others but this just throttled it ten fold.."	bathetic666	post	19.23952659872752	male	White	0.9981232285499573	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	ethnicity: no prediction, age: late 20s, gender: female, explanation: the author clearly states their gender and age as a female in their late 20s. there is no information given about their ethnicity, so a prediction cannot be made on that basis.

"Sorry in advance for the long post, I just feel like this has a lot of context that is needed. 

When I was younger, around 18, I had my first ‚Äúreal‚Äù relationship with this guy. We dated really briefly (only about 3 months) before we broke up, but we saw each other every day for hours on end so it felt like a much longer time. During our relationship, I felt that I was coerced and violated sexually, but didn‚Äôt totally come to that realization until later after we had split. I would have literal PTSD attacks during class, and went to therapy for EMDR to fully process what happened and try to put it behind me. 

For a really long time, I was so angry. I hated him, and would find myself in what was almost rage spirals. I couldn‚Äôt see anything about him online that wouldn‚Äôt set me off, and ruin my whole day, if not the week at just the mention of him. Even after EMDR, I would still sometimes have nightmares, but I found my memory had blocked out a lot. 

It‚Äôs been about 4 years since our relationship, and I‚Äôve been doing other therapy, and I find that this rage has subsided into curiosity? I just genuinely wonder where he is in life, and what he‚Äôs doing, and if his life is as shitty as it should be according to karma. But I also weirdly find myself feeling bad for him. I don‚Äôt think he meant to really hurt me that badly, he‚Äôs just kind of an idiot. Not that he shouldn‚Äôt be held responsible, but he self admittedly would make awful decisions because he couldn‚Äôt help it. Sometimes I feel like reaching out and telling him I forgive him, and letting him know he may not even know he hurt me deeply, but he did, and I forgive him now. I think part of me hopes that it will open the door to him apologizing for what he did, but I can‚Äôt be sure he will. I hope he would, if there is any decency in him. My only evidence that he could have some kind of redeeming quality or reason for me to reach out is when we were dating, his ex girlfriend reached out via letter to in a way, air her grievances about their relationship, and he did want to talk things out with her so she could have closure. 

Am I just looking for a healing fantasy to fulfill something in me, or could there be a possibility for genuine healing so I can finally put that part of my past behind me?"	Khoney1986	post	21.828872778525337	female	White	0.017455630004405975	na	na	na	3	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"I was abused by my older brother when I was a child into my early teen years. For years I separated the bad times from the good times in my head. 
It took years for me to realize that there were no good and bad times. It was all bad. All inappropriate and hurtful. 

Im 33 now, and only cut contact with him a couple of years ago. Sometimes I still have this push that I want to go talk to him. I want to spend time with him like I used too. 
I also understand the idea of wanting the relationship to heal and wanting him to apologize. 
The idea of having the relationship be what I wanted it to be instead of what it was. 

But I know he wont every understand what he did to me. And is incapable of apologizing in a meaningful way. 

It hurts sometimes. But I keep going to counseling and working on it.

The fact that your rage has been turning into curiosity and you‚Äôre considering telling him you‚Äôve forgiven him could be a very hopeful sign that therapy is going well for you and that you‚Äôre healing, which I‚Äôm really happy for you for.. but again giving him any sort of excuses or justification doesn‚Äôt change the fact that what he did was incredibly hurtful as you explained, you‚Äôve mentioned your relationship was briefly a few months but if you were close to him then it‚Äôs understandable that you‚Äôd feel bad for him even if his mistakes caused you a lot of pain, of course you do deserve an apology, and I understand if you want a closure, so you‚Äôre considering contacting him in hopes that he would apologize, but because of the uncertainty of what his response could be and how it would affect you, if you‚Äôre still seeing your therapist then consider asking them about this and discussing what will be better for your own mental health	Khoney1986	reply	na	na	na	0.017455630004405975	weak	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"I've recently started getting panic attacks from trying to heal from my childhood trauma (not going to go into that here). Never been suicidal, never done self harm, rarely get intrusive thoughts. That night, I went crazy.

The panic attack started at ~2 am and lasted till 4:20 am. At first, it was like any other panic attack I've had before (4 attacks in a week), a lot of trembling, fast heart rates, nausea, ill to my stomach, etc.

 About 30 to 40 minutes of waves of symptoms coming and going, I started getting intrusive thoughts. That is new. I was smiling at the idea of drinking energy drinks because my mind told me it would only make the symptoms worse. I got up, grabbed a drink, and started chugging it. It normally takes me about an hour to finish an energy drink. I finished it in under 60 seconds. Then, shortly after, I got another. My mind wanted me to get a third one, but I stopped myself from doing so.

 The shaking got so bad that my right arm wouldn't stop trembling even if I held it in place. I actually thought I was going insane. I guess I was going insane.

 I was scraping and pinching my wrist with my nails. I thought to myself if I still had the knife in my room, but I had put it away. NOW, I am not suicidal and I do not do self-harm.
In the moment, for about 5 - 10 minutes, I wanted to do self-harm because I was going crazy that my arm wouldn't stop shaking. I started to cry. Things have never gotten so bad.

My intrusive thoughts came back once again. I had liquor in my room. I was physically trying not to look at the liquor. It was like my mind was trying to turn my head to the left, but my body, the part I had control of, was trying to look right. My mind won, and I took 2 shots of the liquor. I wanted to vomit the second shot out of my system. I HAD NO CLUE WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME.

I sat on my bed doing nothing, then I grabbed my arm like I was choking it, and it was at that point where it stopped shaking, and the thoughts went away. I was so relieved but so scared it might start again. I told myself everything was alright and I went to sleep shortly after.

I just woke up after 6 hours of sleep. When I woke up, I got whole body twitches, and my mind was just uncomfortable, but after a while, it went away.
I'm in the works of starting therapy. Thank you for reading."	Responsible_Link_635	post	18.313618229690114	female	White	0.8773135542869568	na	na	na	5	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"First of all, I am so so sorry you are dealing with this. I face panic attacks and generalized Anxiety Disorder too so I know how awful these feel. 

I am not a phycologist but have lived my entire life facing these things and have made extreme progress so I hope my advice gives you at least some confidence. 

That being said, I have recently fallen into my own spiral of mental health issues again where I had started getting darker thoughts. I realized when I began to feel clarity again is that it wasn‚Äôt that I WANTED to hurt myself and cause myself more fear and pain. I just wanted the current feelings to stop. Your mind is so powerful and it can create it‚Äôs own defeat to easily. Even if in the long run it made the feeling worse. I liked the thought of myself being gone about the relief not because I wanted to die but because I was so desperate to escape. I think you had a very similar thing. Your body lost control, you said you went through an interval type of attack where you would have lesser symptoms then they would grow again, you became desperate for an escape from this cycle of feeling and your body went into a full on death vs survival mode where your mind truly believed it would either die or face the feelings for an eternity. 

The energy drinks I think was a way for your body to have an illusion of taking control. You know energy drink increase shaking and overstimulation. Therefore by drinking it you create a cause and effect (‚ÄúIf I drink an energy drink that will give the cause of a panic attack.) your mind as I am sure you know is unable to comprehend the amount of panic chemicals it is producing, so it creates a reason, an illusion.  

My family and I have system we call my Cake Recipe. When my recipe is missing something then my anxiety becomes worse and a panic attack can occur. So whenever I start to see anxious for no operant reason I think ‚Äúhow have I been eating latley? A lot of bad food? Fast food? Have I been too isolated, too much time on technology, how has my sleep been? Exercise, self care, recreational time?‚Äù 

The recipe is different for everyone but if you can start to identify what makes up your recipe I think it will help.  

I know how scary these thoughts are. They don‚Äôt feel real in fact, nothing feels real in those moments. But try to remember, if you are worried about these thoughts then, a part of you is still telling you the right things and wants to keep going. I went from being so crippled by my anxiety and panic attacks from separation and health anxiety that I could not physically leave my house for weeks and fear controlled my every breath to living alone in a big city perusing my dream career. Which at a time wasn‚Äôt considered possible for me. You got this, even if you don‚Äôt want to have to do it, you will find a way.‚ô•Ô∏è"	Responsible_Link_635	reply	na	na	na	0.8773135542869568	strong	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

Knowing why my mom is the way she is makes accepting my trauma harder. I‚Äôve seen make progress towards change and healing but she is still a long ways off from leaving her manipulative ways behind. She still gaslights me on occasion but she is the only who stood up for me when management was trying to make me quit while I was pregnant. She‚Äôs never stood up for me before that. It‚Äôs like as soon as I became an adult she started see me as an actual person. It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt excuse the past but again she is trying to heal from her own trauma. At what point is it a slip up versus intentional?? Now that I‚Äôm a mother myself I find I‚Äôm asking that question a lot. I promise myself I‚Äôm not going to yell again. I‚Äôll speak respectfully with my children and help them learn. But then I slip up. And I beat myself up over it.

"Not that I‚Äôm not happy for you, for your Mother sticking up for you. That‚Äôs great, but it also sounds like taking your side might be new behavior. I want to validate your caution and the way being a mother now yourself makes you question your Mother‚Äôs, and perhaps your own, narrative about the past.

I used to really focus on the handful of times my very abusive Mother supported me. Then a therapist I trusted told me that repeating those stories didn‚Äôt lessen the impact of the majority of the time when she repeatedly harmed me herself or put me in harm‚Äôs way. When I stopped clinging to the paltry good I began the work of truly seeing the enormity of the bad.

My Mother used to defensively insist she ‚Äúdid the best she could!‚Äù She‚Äôd then wallow in self-pity about how hard it was and I‚Äôd feel bad for making her cry.

One day I asked myself was it really her best? I‚Äôd time to sit with some of the worst, particularly how she caused us to be homeless twice due to either carelessness or outright criminal behavior.

"Yes I have this same post posted on a number of different subreddits. I just really REALLY need people to reach out to me. I really need to hear some words of comfort or advice.

I feel so incredibly sad and lonely. Growing up I had a twin brother who was my best friend and I loved him more than anything else in the world. He died, and my dad got really distant and physically/sexually abusive because of this, and he essentially abandoned me in the end. My mom put all her attention on I always struggled to make friends, but then I met my best friend. After almost 8-9 years of friendship he abandoned me on the spot. I had no one for a while and was completely alone and suicidal for about a year until college. As depressed and anxious as I felt, I made a lot of really greta friends in college and I feel so lucky. I returned home for summer break yesterday, and now I feel super empty again. I can't handle another three months of no one again. All of my friends live states away. Truth be told even with my friends I still felt unhappy at college, but I feel so much worse now.

I'm pissed at how my dad treated me. I just want my brother back, he was all I needed to keep me happy. And I miss my other friend so much too. I genuinely love my home so much believe it or not, but I just feel so lonely and empty all day. I don't think I said a single word today. I feel like I have nothing I am living for. I hate living."

I'll start by saying I'm new to this sub, so I'm sorry if I'm not the best with wording this. I've been hurt by a lot of people in my life, friends, family, ex partners, etc... and it got pretty severe at times, rarely physical, but still severe enough to leave lasting damage, which leads me to my problem. I don't think I know how to love people, even the good people in my life, and it really bothers me, I don't love friends, I don't love family, even myself. But I do love things, like stories, characters, games, etc... I think people have just tried to hurt me and/or leave so much that I'm scared to. I know it's a weird problem to have and I don't know if this is even the right place to ask, but I don't know where to start when it comes to loving people again, not in an obsessive way or anything like that, in a caring way. If anyone has tips for where I can start approaching this, I'm open to hearing it out.	dmg81102	post	15.13738287498544	female	White	0.980242908000946	na	na	na	4	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

I‚Äôm commenting because I‚Äôd also like to hear others input. I feel very disconnected and detached from everyone in my life. And would like to learn how to not be this way	dmg81102	reply	na	na	na	0.980242908000946	no	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
I would ask, before commenting specifically, if you have either engaged a psychotherapist, a professional spiritual leader (priest, rabbi, minister, etc.) or gone to a Codependency Anonymous (Coda) 12 step group meeting?  You sound like you are in trouble, the threat being potentially, isolation due to abandonment issues, so you would benefit from the actual human contact possibilities I just mentioned.  Dialing 211 info line might be a good place to begin, and use your ‚Äúchat‚Äù options to acquire suggestions and perhaps hear fragments of occasional wisdom.	dmg81102	reply	na	na	na	0.980242908000946	weak	no	strong	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
I have not engaged in any of those yet. I am aware I need therapy of some kind and it would help but every time I‚Äôve reached out or inquired I‚Äôm just put on a 6-12 month waiting list for any sort of mental health/trauma help. It‚Äôs extremely frustrating and has definitely discouraged me. You are probably close to spot on with the abandonment issues resulting in isolation. I just got out of a very physically, mentally and emotionally abusive relationship last year. So I definitely struggle and am still trying to overcome a lot of things related. I‚Äôve never heard of a codependency anonymous group that you mentioned, I‚Äôll have to look into.

I was just wondering if there are any other people besides me who would suddenly start freaking out about the amount of time left to live? Like my father died at 50. If I die at 50, that means I have like 24 years left. That freaks me out. What are the chances I die at 50. Perhaps even earlier.

"‚ÄúI‚Äôll probably just say that I‚Äôm having a panic and cry.‚Äù

This seems completely appropriate for the situation. Hotlines deal with this all the time, they will know what to do. Whatever response you have, they have probably had similar calls many times before. They will likely take the lead on the conversation and guide you. You don‚Äôt have to have everything figured out before you call.

Sometimes I take anxiety-inducing things in small doses. You could add the hotline number to your speed dial. You could call and hang up before it rings. You could pretend to call and practice what that might feel like. Any of these things are a step toward your goal.

So often with my anxiety, once I actually do the thing I feel so much relief. Wishing the best for you."	Responsible_Link_635	reply	na	na	na	0.9964560866355896	weak	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"I hear you. I also have a terrible time asking for help or support. I freeze up. To add to that, making phone calls can also trigger panic attacks for me, even for normal phone calls.


First and foremost, you deserve support and care. I suspect ppl who have never had a panic attack can't truly understand how awful and sickening and disruptive they are.


And while there's no guarantee a hotline can *fix* a panic attack, I know that being with someone who is compassionate and warm and caring and understanding definitely does help. What's more, a person staffing a hotline (particularly regarding SA) brings both training and genuine concern. 


All of which is to say, your desire to call a hotline under these circumstances is valid and can help.  (Note: some hotlines have a text option, if you find that less of a hurdle.)


Some phone strategies that have worked for me:

- write out a starting script. On paper, write who I am calling, the phone number, the date, the time, the reason I am calling. Write what I expect to say for the first few lines. Make a bullet list of things I need the person to know in order to help me, or at least understand my situation. (This method is a combo of my therapist's recommendation to write a script and best practices from work as a project manager)

- pretend I am supporting a dear friend who is struggling, and talk myself through it as if I were talking to them. ""It's okay, sweety, I know this is hard, but I am going to be with you every step of the way"" and the like.

- hug a stuffie. I carry a little one in my backpack that no one else can see, but I can reach in and squeeze their softness. At home/in privacy, I hold one against my heart - the pressure is calming. In general, engaging other senses in doing things you find soothing can be helpful.


Most of this requires a little preparation and thought, before the next panic attack, while you are not currently having one and can brainstorm strategies.


For that matter, it's okay to contact a support hotline when you *aren't* having a panic attack. They may even have some good ideas about strategies for the future. Research regarding triggers and panic attacks and strategies for managing them is always being updated, so they may have new information that's helpful. 


One last thing, about not knowing what to say: that's okay. It is sufficient to just say what happened to you, how you feel now, and that you have a history of SA (no need to go into any detail unless you want to).  In other words, this isn't a transaction, or a conversation with a specific goal. It's just about telling your truth in a supportive atmosphere. That, in and of itself, absolutely does help!"

Hey, I am part of mobile crisis in my neck of the woods, so I am one of those people that would answer the hotline call. Do you have any specific questions that I could help answer that may put you in a more comfortable place when deciding to call?

"I've been where you are and what I can say, that I hope helps, is they are trained to listen and help you. I've been so scared before, and similar to you, you didn't want to reach out to a friend due to burdening them. Once my friend actually made me call, I couldn't even breathe when talking to them, but I did it for my friend cause she was worried about me. 

They are there to help you navigate and provide a safe, non judgemental space. Even if you call and can't speak, they will recognize this and help you focus on breathing, which is sometimes a helpful reminder when you're in that state. 

I guess the short version of this is please don't be scared to pick up the phone when you need to! Picking up the phone while the scariest thing is the bravest and biggest act of self-love you can do for yourself in the moment.

"It was yesterday, and to give you some idea about where his house is, it's literally two houses away from my home. After 20 days of dealing with trauma about what he did 9 years ago when I was just 12, I got home from vacation and decided to drive by his house after a lot of thinking. Basically, I can't not drive by his house if I want to drive deeper into town. Which I do almost daily. 

When I drove by his house, I got a lot of flashbacks to good and some very bad memories. After 3 minutes, I had to stop. My legs were shaking, and I began feeling nauseated and ill to my stomach. I tried to cool off by getting out of the car for fresh air and doing deep breaths. That didn't seem to work, and I bagen to tear up. My legs wouldn't stop shaking, and soon after, my arms were shaking too.

I finally decided to call the only person who knows what happened, my best friend. I cried and was still trembling but after about 10 minutes of talking to him, trying to distract myself, I was able to feel better but the emotions and trying to get my breathing normal again took about 15-20 minutes.

After that, I drove home and forced myself not to look at his house. I didn't want my dad to see me crying when I got home. It's so awful that he is still there two houses away."	Responsible_Link_635	post	15.42410731897494	male	White	0.9960235357284546	na	na	na	4	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

">he said that we should just try it and if i don‚Äôt like it we can stop

This is concerning to me. Your partner shouldn‚Äôt be trying to convince you after you said no. He needs to respect your boundaries on this and the fact that he tried to convince you to ignore your boundaries tells me he's not someone safe to ‚Äòtry it‚Äô with. If he‚Äôs not respecting your boundaries out the bedroom he won‚Äôt respect them when you‚Äôre having sex.

>he‚Äôs also really into hitting/choking/being dominant.

You two aren‚Äôt sexually compatible. You‚Äôre a sexual violence survivor dating someone who has a kink of sexual violence. The possibility of him re-traumatizing you or worse contributing to additional trauma is extremely high.

Since you‚Äôre asking advice I would say leave this relationship and focus on healing and treatment (therapy). *You can‚Äôt heal trauma when you still feel unsafe.*

I‚Äôm a >!SA and multiple rape survivor!<. My current partner waited **years** to have sex with me and he didn‚Äôt pressure me at all. He also respected my boundaries. My ‚Äòno‚Äô was heard without me having to explain myself. There was never a discussion to push me when I said I wasn‚Äôt ready. He accepted where I was and waited without complaint or coercion.

I had dated a handful of people before him that stated they were OK waiting for me to be ready, but every single one of them would either make me feel bad about it or pressure me. One jerk even said I was unfairly punishing him for what someone else did to me. Like my body was something he was entitled to simply because we were dating.

A partner‚Äôs horniness isn‚Äôt your problem to resolve. Anyone that says ‚Äòhey let‚Äôs have sex even though you're traumatized‚Äô is putting their needs above yours and a shitty partner. Personally, I would run from the guy you‚Äôre dating. He‚Äôs showing you who he is, believe him."	lexaprolegend	reply	na	na	na	0.9960407018661499	no	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
">i was physically abused by a close friend for a couple years. it wasn‚Äôt super extreme but she used to hit, punch, grab, indian burn, etc.

I'm sorry, but that is pretty extreme, especially if it's done against your will. However, it can be just as traumatising even if you went along with it, but isn't something you actually enjoy but did to pleasure the other. The trouble with trauma is that it can be normalised and it doesn't feel extreme, for you, but in actual fact it is, you just don't know any better as it has been 'the norm' for you. 

>he‚Äôs also really into hitting/choking/being dominant

You have set a boundary with your boyfriend and have given a very good and reasonable explanation. Your boyfriend wants to trample those boundaries not just by having sex but doing exactly what your trauma entails. That's a red flag. He's not respecting your boundaries and he's not respecting your trauma and has therefore no respect for you and your mental and physical health.

>he said that we should just try it and if i don‚Äôt like it we can stop

Again he is prioritising his own needs above your mental and physical health. Can he be trusted with your safety?

> i think i‚Äôm on the asexual spectrum too because i don‚Äôt really have a sex drive?

This is something you should explore with a therapist at your own pace. Only you can answer this. It can be that you are asexual but it could also be that your trauma is lowering your sex drive, or the unsafe pressure your boyfriend is putting you under. Being asexual is fine, there are loads of people who are. Being pressured into something that you are not ready for and have a trauma from is not.

My advice would be to seek out a therapist who deals with sexual trauma. Your bf is giving me red flag vibes galore. So perhaps you should take a look at what other boundaries he doesn't respect.

Not being able to defend your own boundaries is not uncommon and especially in people who have been abused before. So a way to deal with this is therapy. But in the mean time 'no is a perfectly good answer.'"	lexaprolegend	reply	na	na	na	0.9960407018661499	strong	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"I used to be pretty courageous to sleep alone at my home. But around last year an incident that occurred caused me to suffer a trauma that led me to this condition. I face anxiety attacks in the form of heart palpitations and weird bowel movements when I get to sleep. What had happened last year was that my previous room mate‚Äôs ex boyfriend had kicked open the home door. The issue was of a love triangle. He got in and punched my room mate‚Äôs current boyfriend and it turned pretty violent with minor injuries. I remember I was in freeze mode and I couldn‚Äôt do anything at that moment. However, I was there to support my room mate but she never kept the same bond after I moved out of that house. It haunts me and now that I moved to a new apartment after staying at another dorm, the trauma came flashing back and I can‚Äôt get sleep. I go over to friend‚Äôs place to get good sleep and I started therapy for the same. 
But as and when I come home, I get anxiety as usual. I feel I‚Äôm not safe at home because of this trauma. I do have a room mate but she‚Äôs away for a couple of days. 

I feel sad that I have to suffer this it hurts bad."	Flashy-Detective7616	post	25.49494962218258	female	White	0.9989802241325378	na	na	na	3	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"I am a 22 year old male. I've been dealing with Emotional Numbness and Sexual Dysfunction for almost 3 years that began after intense stress, depression, and anxiety.

People ask me what was going on during that time that led to all of this?

I'm always reluctant to tell people because it's pretty embarrassing to admit, but I will finally tell you guys.

I've always been insecure about my penis size. I always thought it was small and because of it I felt like I would never have a satisfying sex or dating life.

I've always had this insecurity, but it didn't really hit me until a few years ago how bad it began to bother me. I was constantly worrying and stressing myself out about it. Thoughts began running through my mind like, ""No one is gonna want to be with me. I won't be able to satisfy my partners. I have to live with this for the rest of my life."" I convinced myself that because of the size of my genitalia, I was doomed to live a life of misery. This mindset drove me into that stressful, depressed, and anxious state.

Shortly thereafter is when I loss my emotions and my sexual function. I began to ask myself, ""What's the point in getting an erection or horny if I don't have an adequate penis size?""

This is the situation that drove me into this state.

However, I have since come to the realization that my penis size is normal. It's 6.5 inches with a girth of 5.2 inches. I realized I was measuring wrong growing up which made me believe that I was smaller than I actually was. Also from watching pornography, I would constantly compare myself to the guys in porn and it would always make me feel inadequate.

This realization did make me feel a little better, but unfortunately I am still stuck in this state of emotional numbness and sexual dysfunction from that episode.

I kind of hoped that me realizing that my penis size is normal would bring me back to normal, but unfortunately it hasn't.

I believe that episode of intense stress, depression, and anxiety caused significant inflammation to my brain and body that has been difficult to reverse.

I wish I would've realized before this all started that my penis size is normal and that I have nothing to worry about. Perhaps if I did, I wouldn't be in this position right now. That's how I honestly feel.

So yes, there it is. This is what caused my problems that I am still trying to resolve. Body Dysmorphia and insecurities that made me believe that my life was doomed."

I got attacked by a random man in a ski mask at 12:30am outside my house on Monday. I think about how he was standing there and I turned and saw him and screamed and ran inside but he chased me and grabbed me and pushed me onto my stairs. I fought him off but that fighting for my life wasn‚Äôt the scariest part, it was turning to see him standing there. I can‚Äôt get over that and everytime I think about it I go into a dissociative state and can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs real, sometimes I think I was hallucinating it but the police found dna, his footprints, and the dogs found a trail of him. I lived alone when that happened but now I moved into my moms house because I can‚Äôt even imagine being alone at night anymore. I also have borderline personality disorder and have been in a battle with my mental health, anxiety, depression, mania, and chronic suicide ideation; anyways I have come a long way and now a lot of my anxiety‚Äôs have become true. I feel lost like I am not real or anything around me is real, and everytime I look back on it I can‚Äôt believe he was standing there. Again I feel so lost I thought about going to the psych ward but so much of me changes during the hour that one minute I‚Äôm scream crying and the next I‚Äôm perfectly fine.

"Not medical advice but what‚Äôs typically next is to process the shock of what happened otherwise your brain won‚Äôt be able to rest. When things happen so fast, the brain doesn‚Äôt know what to do with the information. 

‚ÄúWtf just happened? Why? Why is the world this way? Am I still in danger?‚Äù

First I was‚Ä¶
Then I saw‚Ä¶
Then this happened‚Ä¶
Then I went to the _ and did _‚Ä¶

Write out or speak out what happened before during and after. Start with what felt normal before and what went back to normal after and you‚Äôll give your brain a chance to sequence things and rest. Otherwise it‚Äôll stay on high alert. Repeat this as many days as you need to until it sinks in.

"Hey all, during the last few appointments with my therapist the topic of childhood trauma kept getting suggested when talking about my symptoms and overal situation. For reference, i suffer from DPDR and anxiety (both normal and social), with (depending on the other two) episodes of depression. My family situation is not well, and the symptoms I've listed have remained pretty much constant for the last 5 years.

Anyways, the reason im asking for help here is because i dont know how to deal with knowing what might be going on with me. I have big red flags in my past suggesting something went wrong very early on, but which i kept deep in a dark corner of my mind until my therapist started suggesting things. If im being honest, it does not look good at all, and im feeling afraid of what might be there. Every time i think about it a deeply upsetting, morbid, nauseating feeling overtakes me. 

My therapist (this one not being specialized enough for my case) told me im being redirected to another, more specialized place for my issues. so at least help is on its way. But in the mean time, this feeling of being afraid, and the nauseating morbid feeling whenever my thoughts come anywhere near this topic still bother me daily. Are there any tools or strategies to help myself deal with this?"	Glock_Gobbler	post	30.215328310293344	male	White	0.9913619160652161	na	na	na	5	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

Repressed memories do not exist, and if the memory is simply forgotten or compartmentalized, then there's nothing anyone can (or should?) do to ""force"" the memories to resurface.

"I'll just suggest some things, you can decide if any of them work for you, I'm not a professional or anything I've just picked up things that have worked for me personally, during my years of treatment.

Try to be gentle and understanding with yourself when you are feeling something unpleasant or overwhelming. Take space for yourself whenever you need it, if anyone is bothering you or making you feel stressed for any reason, take some space and focus on yourself. Spend time doing things that make you feel relaxed and looked after.

Your mind is telling you it isn't feeling too good/safe, so you can respond by being kind and looking after your body. Which is, by extension, going to make your mind feel safer.

For instance, when you are physically not well, what makes you feel looked after, how do you get through it? Curling up in a blanket and reading a book? Making yourself a comforting meal and watching movies? Putting on some comfortable clothing, putting in headphones and going out for a walk? Getting out in the fresh air and natural light, doing gardening or just sitting in the sun listening to a podcast? Catching up with a good friend and doing something you both like? Getting out the art supplies or markers and doing some painting or colouring?

The best thing you can do while you wait for your new therapist is just find ways to pass the time that keep you entertained and help you de-stress. Keep your mind occupied until your therapy starts and then you can unpack the trauma properly with the guidance of your professional.

You can try some mindful breathing and self-soothing thoughts/phrases to bring you back to the present moment when the nausea and other sensations feel overwhelming. 

I used to experience DPDR also and a few things helped me. Having an item to hold in my hand and touch would keep me more grounded, I used to keep a large agate stone in my pocket for this. Looking around at your surroundings and picking a colour then finding 5 things of that colour to say aloud. Sipping on my favourite soothing drink while focusing on the flavour and temperature. I also used to stop and breathe slowly for a minute while saying these words to myself aloud ""I'm a person, I'm right here [at home/at the park] it's okay, I'm okay"".

Now I know none of these suggestions are a cure, but if you can pick out your own set of mindful habits and practice calming, enjoyable activities throughout your day, it can really do a lot to bring your distress down a few notches in times of overwhelm, you can definitely manage to get through until therapy picks up and your body can learn to soothe as an automatic response to distressing memories/emotions."

"- If you don't feel ready to explore that area of your mind/the subject, you don't have to. It's your decision. They shouldn't push you into anything that you cannot handle right now.

- You might benefit from using Pete Walkers ""13 steps for managing flashbacks"" (including emotional flashbacks). 

- Another good source for help is Patrick Teahan's youtube channel. Excellent videos, including ""When you can't remember childhood trauma"".

- It's also ok to distract yourself with healthy coping mechanisms while you're waiting for the next appointment. You don't have to be trying to figure anything out right now, there's time for that later. Rest is a crucial part of healing.

- Be kind to yourself. If this affects your ability to sleep, you can try telling yourself ""I can think about this later/ tomorrow, but right now I need the rest."" or try various breathing exercises to calm down.

I've been away from home for about two weeks, and in that time, trauma has really kicked in. I am going home in two days, and my home is two houses away from where I was molested 9 years ago when I was 12 years old. I drive by that house almost every day and now that my trauma has gotten way worse, I can already feel I'll get triggered when I drive by it. The man still lives there, but I haven't seen him in a long time. But I don't know what will happen when I do. My hatred towards him has only grown, and I sometimes think about seeing him out in public, and I just cry and get so angry. I don't want to physically hurt him but I don't think I'll be able to handle seeing him, and my town only has a pop of 600 people! And no one of them know what happened.

The house has a balcony on the front of it and it goes into the room where so much stuff happened. I don't know what to do. I can't really move away. House prices have skyrocketed on this goddamned island and I need my job there.

"First and foremost, I want to validate your feelings. It makes perfect sense that you would feel this way.  I'm glad you reached out here, since you say no one there knows. It's better to not carry this alone. 


Next, it sounds like it is reasonable to expect you might see him at some point in the future. Therefore I recommend creating a plan now, and writing out your Care Plan, and carrying that plan on you at all times, perhaps in a document on your phone.


Things you might include in your Care Plan: immediately removing yourself from the place where you are (go to your car, go into another building, go to a park or a beach, etc.). Write down numbers of hotlines to talk to a person trained in discussing SA. List of friends you might call. Make a list of soothing distractions (include as many of the five senses as practical). 


Things I use myself as soothing distractions, just to give you some possible ideas: watching yt videos of kittens and puppies and soft baby lambs and bouncing baby goats. Calming music playlist. Incense or essential oils to smell. Carrying something soft (I carry a small stuffie in my backpack) to rub or to hug, especially nice to hold against my heart.  Once I get home: comfort foods (I keep Mac n cheese and ice cream in the freezer).

"Yeah, there is another route, but that one goes outside of town and basically circles it, so it is kind of unreliable. The bad thing is I basically see the house whenever I go outside. 

I think the only way this could be fixed is by therapy. And time."	Responsible_Link_635	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9964084029197693	no	strong	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.
"If the other route helps you avoid it until you can seek therapy, that might be a helpful solution for now. Exposure therapy would likely help with this. That is basically where you‚Äôd be exposed to the trigger, in this case the house, and raise your anxiety until you get through it with a safe and trusted therapist. 

I hope you feel better once you‚Äôre home."	Responsible_Link_635	reply	na	na	na	0.9964084029197693	no	no	no	na	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

just wondering, if anyone feels like they are in a good place with their trauma how they got there, how it felt to do the trauma work, and how it feels now.	snaggeltooth	post	19.901547501174687	male	White	0.001789500704035163	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"Does anyone here have so much guilt built up in them that any criticism makes you collapse?

 Because I do.
 
I want to free myself from all these triggers and trauma, I want to be normal.
To not glance across the room see something on the TV and it take me to a horrible moment. I want to be confident, but how do i do that? How does people have confidence? I could never look at myself in the mirror and think you look good, no I think omg you did a shit job on your makeup. 

I could never think anything good about myself, and because of that I look for something attractive about every person I see. 

How do you feel worth? What is worth?  I just know I never feel worthy of anything that I get. 

I'm rational sometimes but so much takes me back and right now I'm fighting. I'm fighting them I'm standing tall but I feel fake. That's not me. 

I'm trembling inside hoping wishing for a hand to take hold of that will stand with me. But every day now it's more and more realizations that's washing over me. A whole 35 years of being taught this, how else can i feel? I'm in anguish over the little girl in me that just wants a family and I feel misery is the only thing in my future.

Why can't I have a dream? Because I tell myself it will never happen. 

The inner me is in so many pieces, just floating around looking for a shimmer that will never come. How can I explain how hard it is right now? I have lost my entire family and every memory that's coming up is fake, I notice all the red flags now. 

But is it too late? I am misreading everyone, I'm suspicious of everyone, and I don't feel safe ever. 

I want this to stop, I don't want to fight anymore or be strong. I want to lay down, or just end it. 

They won't leave me alone, I don't know why. I'm nothing special they made sure of that, I'm nothing, like they wanted me to be so why won't they leave me alone.

 I'm a recluse, a shell. I don't even know who I am. Right now the only thoughts going through my head are bad, it's all that exists. Why?

 Why is this so hard just to tell my mind not to do that?

 I have never wanted to hurt people physically or mentally, I've done both (not intentionally- mentally) and the guilt makes me dream of them almost every night.

 Who am I? What do I like? What can I do?..... I'm nothing everyone leaves because of my mental health. 

All I have ever wanted was a family, to get married (to change my last name) and to be loved. Those were my dreams, forever gone, or it feels like it. I don't like to tell people what's on  in my mind because they never understand, I say wrong things all the time because I think they fit but the other person is like what. Then I can't explain how it connected for me. My mind doesn't work right and I don't know how to fix it.

That's me in all my complexity. The real question, how do I be happy when everything in me is telling me that everything is bad?"	Guilty_Nectarine5940	post	22.762416059965187	female	White	0.9978038668632507	na	na	na	1	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"I would love a therapist that I could vibe with but I can‚Äôt even find one with open availability. I had a therapist recently that I sorta vibed with. She took me 4 months to find. Basically she was the only person that responded. I was desperate at that point and happy to have anyone willing to talk to me. She said somethings that in retrospect really didn‚Äôt make me feel great. I would have kept seeing her despite this but she just randomly gave my slot to someone else. I guess that person‚Äôs problems/schedule was more important than mine. She had me choose another time but missed it twice so I just took the hint. That was last august. I write to at least 4 therapists in my area a month and haven‚Äôt found anyone to take me on or even respond to me. I have mostly used psychology today because I can search by insurance. I have state insurance so I‚Äôm limited on places. 

How does a person find a therapist? I watch YouTube people that deal with childhood trauma and they will recommend types of therapy or say to find someone that specializes in this or that but I can‚Äôt even find someone that just takes my insurance let alone specializes in my mental issues. 

Am I doing it wrong? Am I just so intolerable therapist are ignoring me?"	BobbysueWho	post	34.04488339730425	female	White	0.9991501569747925	na	na	na	3	traumatoolbox	no prediction.

"You‚Äôre not doing anything wrong, it can be difficult to find a therapist who is the right fit. All that internet advice about what kind of therapy to try is written by the kind of person who wants to get paid for making content, whether articles or videos. It‚Äôs easy for them to say but hard to actually do. I‚Äôm in a similar boat. I had an adverse experience with my last individual therapist about 5 years ago. Since then I did several group therapy things. I actually love group therapy more than individual because part of my trauma is the result of being too obedient in an authoritarian system, and in individual therapy with my last therapist I still had a hard time listening to my own inner voice if it was saying something different from what she advised. But I do need to do individual therapy again, and I‚Äôve been trying since last August. I had a couple first appointments that didn‚Äôt go well. One did go well but it took me a few weeks to make up my mind and when I tried to book more sessions she said she was full. So I‚Äôm now on her wait list.

If you‚Äôre interested in trying group therapy while you wait, I found one group through meetup (group was in person), one through googling my specific trauma (group was on zoom), plus I joined a couple support groups (on zoom) for my particular issue. For me group therapy helped so much because my trauma is relational and it was so healing to realize I‚Äôm not alone and to work through some issues in a safe space with other people going through the same thing."

"life is different than what it was 30 years ago when our parents were our age, they want you to lead theife the same way as they did.

I'm a teenager and I recently im noticing so many things that my parents do which i feel are really weird.

Once my mom forcefully pulled me into the kitchen, screaming at me asking me to learn to cook, of course cooking is a basic life skill that everyone should know to survive but do you know what my mum said instead? she told me if I dont learn to cook the in laws will blame her for not teaching me to cook. This felt totally disgusting. 

She keeps saving gold jewellery so that she could give it as dowry for my marriage (im still a teenager), they don't understand the world isn't like what it was in the 90s, i have the right to choose my partner, if they demand for dowry i can simply reject the marriage proposal, i can find someone who is genuinely interested in cooking, work can be shared between couples, if he cooks then i can clean, as simple as that.

My mom never lets me wear Western dresses, even if she does she allows only very modest outfits like jeans tshirt etc. Looking at kids my age dress up like how i want to dress up i feel really inferior and ugly infront of them. wanting to wear modern dresses doesn't mean i want to show my boobs to people, wanting to wear trousers doesn't mean I'm trying to look sexy infront of guys. 

Also recently I've noticed this, usually in my home each person has a list of household work that they are responsible for and we do it till date, but now my mom wants me to do all the work all though I'm just a teenager and i have to concentrate on my board exams, the reason she says for this is that how can I be married off without knowing household work.

all these makes me want to live away from them, this isn't what teenagers should think, i know we will have our parents only for a short time with us but they shouldn't force us to live the life the want.

i hope indian parents realise how toxic they are and try to change. i am just a teenager this is the age where i start having my own dreams, i dream of living alone in a place i want to be in, wearing dresses i like, studying something i like in college, doing well in college, getting a good job and going to places to treat mysel f and live the life i want.

i don't want to get committed and married at 24 with a stranger, share a bed with that stranger, make f**king babies with the stranger, cook and clean for the stranger. why would I do this why should I do this?????"	ideservethingstoo	post	22.73829932074252	female	White	0.9982690811157227	na	na	na	4	traumatoolbox	ethnicity: south asian, age: teenager, gender: female, explanation: the author mentions dowry and in-laws, cultural elements traditionally associated with south asian societies, and identifies herself as a teenager. the narrative reflects on experiences related with female gender roles in india such as learning to cook, wearing modest outfits, getting married early and dowry culture which indicates she's female.
