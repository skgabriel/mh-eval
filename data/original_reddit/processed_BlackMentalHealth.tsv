"Figured I'd share a revelation after a few recent discussions with my therapist. I realized that I have some pretty deeply internalized self-hatred in the form of believing that I need to atone for being not only *Black* but a *Black Man.* And the the only way to transcend that is to become as wealthy and successful as possible. It's ironic because I know that it'll never change *what* I am. ""*Even if you in a Benz, you still a ni**---* *in a coupe**.*"" Doesn't help that I went to PWIs with mostly middle-class to rich White/Asian kids who made sure I never forgot that I'm poor and Black and made it a point to ostracize me for it. I was sexually groomed by anyone that tried, including one of my own teachers, by leaning into that insecurity and making me believe that I might actually be worthy of love and attention despite being black and poor. Obviously wasn't the case.

I realized it last week. I just signed a job offer that could net me 6-figures and give me a prestigious title at one of the largest firms in my industry, at 25 no less. Yet, I feel no change. Nothing. My parents basically didn't care and those people that made me feel that way won't know because they probably don't even remember that I exist. I still want to be successful but I need to tap into the healthier reasons. Success in spite of people that don't know I exist is only going to make me miserable if it already hasn't. The journey of healing properly from that part of my past just started.

Anyone else went through something similar?"	Obtainable20	post	12.031292344545545	female	White	0.006723842583596706	na	na	na	3	BlackMentalHealth

Yeah, that section within the black community that thinks success and status is the only thing that makes you worthy of love is something I don't subscribe to. It's a parasitic mentality within our community and I don't engage with individuals who think that way. My wife and I were dead broke when we got together and it took time and team work to get into a good place in our lives.

"I guess you can say I'm burnt out and...stressed? More depressed and apathetic.

I want to be in a different career field. I'm (25F) the only black person there and the youngest there. It's a retail job, but...I feel so alone. I've worked there for a couple years and it's a good job, I'm just lonely and want to be around people who are more relatable. I also want to do something more creative. Honestly, I don't want to work for someone else at all and would rather work for myself, but I need skills necessary to do that. Considering some side hustles at the moment.

I don't have any friends, and all I've been doing is working and taking my son to his appointments. My social battery is short (introverted and anxious), so after I handle my responsibilities, I'm kind of burnt out. Not sure if that would be the case if I had friends and spent more time doing enjoyable things. I don't know lol. I'm not sure what to do. In the process of overcoming my anxiety in terms of facing my fears and living my life truly for myself, but I feel down because of where I am and the unhappiness I feel due to years of not being an active or healthy participant in my life. I'm tired of ""suck it up, buttercup"". You can only suppress things and push on for so long before you have to sit down and really figure yourself out.

Idk. Just needed to let this out. No one to really talk to and my therapy session was yesterday (and I couldn't say everything I wanted to because it's only an hour).

"I feel for you, honestly.  That ""deal with it"" BS is exactly that. Everyone has their limit, especially when you aren't able to feed your soul, creatively. I deal with extreme anxiety and depression to the point where I have to take meds to stay even (even being in the grocery store can cause panic attacks sometimes). And I love my kids, but honestly it just all ends up being a lot to handle, especially with everything just getting more and more frustrating outside our personal spaces. What I'm trying to say is, you're not alone.

So I'm in a different but kind of the same type of situation. I used to play table top RPGs a lot with friends when I lived in another state, and we all came from similar childhood backgrounds, though different nationalities since most of them are Mexican and I'm multiracial (black/white). But there was just an unspoken commonality and comfortability there that I really miss. We didn't have to explain anything, and when something did come up, it was always a ""yeah man, I got you"". I haven't tried to hook up with any groups in my new spot because honestly it's vanilla as hell here, with the few POC at work I talk with don't share the same interests.

Sometimes it's really hard to find your people, especially when you have a limited amount of spoons to handle everything in your life.

Yes, this happens to me too. And it's a trait of narcissist parents, look up the reddit forum raisedbynarcissists and see if you can identify any of your families behavior when people post. There's really no stopping them, unfortunately it's annoying but you will have to try your best to stop caring what other people think anymore, it's difficult even for me but realize if they attack you because of what she's said and twisted about you, then they are not worth getting to know you, and if she does something directly and you can tell her to stop do that, or try not to give a reaction at all, this technique is called grey rocking. She is looking to trigger you and get a reaction so be boring in your response and give her nothing, one day you'll be able to leave and have your own place and peace of mind.	crazygurl3	reply	na	na	na	0.998497486114502	weak	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"My grandma did that regularly. Whether it was malicious intent or mental health issues is up for debate. It hurt knowing that I would do so much for someone who was hellbent on making me out to be a villain. Long story short, in late 2019 I went on a warpath after she lied to people about me not letting any family visit. I went no contact/sporadic very low contact and explained to her why. I also wasn‚Äôt interested in an apology or effort towards a healthy relationship bc I knew it wasn‚Äôt gonna happen at that time. This started a campaign of flying monkeys trying to manipulate, including my own sister. My grandma ended up having several strokes from covid which left her in a rehab facility until she passed last year. Thankfully I‚Äôm at a place where I can forgive her for all that. However, I still look at my fam crazy still bc they acted on all that and disrespected me worse than any bigot could‚Äôve.

I say all that to say, the best thing you can do is to work towards distancing yourself from them. Give yourself permission to be the villain in their eyes, and also to be happy for once. It may not be an easy road, but the payoff will be worth it. Also, if you‚Äôre able to do so, look into mental health resources to navigate through all that hurt.

"First of all, you shouldnt compare your suffering to others. We all suffer and suffer in different ways and thats ok. No matter how rich or poor you are there's always someone better or worse off and all we can do is try our best. Its ok to not feel ok and if you dont feel ok you should reach out for help.

Secondly, there's nothing wrong with being gay, bi, trans, queer, asexual, pansexual, etc. You shouldn't feel ashamed and there's nothing wrong with you. Even if you watch gay porn that doesn't make you gay and you should feel free to explore your sexuality. You could feel one way today and another the next. That's part of life and sexuality isnt set in stone. God loves all his children and if you go out into the world and do good things then i believe that God will repay you for that.

Third, there's nothing wrong with being a homebody. I probably go on a social outing once or twice a month. Then i need to come home and let my anxiety cool down. However, since you are feeling depressed you should talk to someone because a lot of mental illnesses can make you isolate without you noticing you're isolating.

I was adopted and was sent to live with birth parent later on and lets just say that due to their own trauma they made it clear that they were unable to care for me while prioritizing the ones they kept. It kind of felt like a double 'fu' but logically I get that they were traumatized as well.

"I have been grappling with my identity as a black man, constantly feeling like I am struggling to define myself. Throughout my life, I have often been perceived as soft and uncool, which has subjected me to bullying from friends, family, and others. These experiences, coupled with societal pressures, have left me with deep-rooted insecurities and a sense of cultural dissonance in relation to my identity as a black man. I have made significant progress in overcoming these insecurities as I have grown older, but I still feel a profound disconnect from any black community, including my own family.

Recently, I had the opportunity to watch ""The Blackening"" with a local black nerd group, and one of the characters resonated with me as an allegory for black men like myself. Despite the humor in the portrayal, it brought forth many of the insecurities I had previously experienced and shed light on how certain characters can reflect the perspectives of black people towards their own community, albeit exaggerated.

In an effort to gain more clarity and understanding, I have started purchasing books that delve into the topic of cultural dissonance. Some of the titles I have chosen include ""The Awkward Black Man"" by Walter Mosey and ""Invisible Man"" by Ralph Ellison. I hope that through reading these works, I can gain insights and find a sense of belonging within myself and within the broader context of my identity as a black man.

Has anyone experienced something similar? And if so how are you addressing it?

Yes. Then I found out so many people are insecure about their blackness, even my friends who I would‚Äôve never thought. It dawned on me that ‚Äúcultural dissonance‚Äù is actually a super common experience in our community and that strangely made me feel more connected to blackness.

"Thank You for reading this. Good Morning everyone, I hope you are all well. I am reaching out just to see if I can have any others advice through this situation (this will be somewhat long). I am a junior in college and my ex and I of a little under nine months had to call things quit. These nine months were very very interesting, it taught me quite a bit about myself and she said it did the same for her, now time to get into it.

Our time together, was rather interesting. Filled with good and bad, but one thing that was for certain is that I believed I may have been strung along in certain fashions allow me to elaborate. Throughout our time together, I would consistently find my ex talking to other guys on the through texts and I would confront her about it. Now no, I would never yell at her. That's not how my father taught me to behave with your girlfriends or women you are interested in. So we had our discussions she would state ""I would never do it again."" then turn around and do it again.

Things weren't always like this she would ebb and flow pretty consistently. It would almost seem like every two weeks she'd be interested and then there would be a spell for two weeks where she would be present but not ""be present"" if that makes sense. No we didn't live together but we would spend considerable time together considering we went to the same school. And I'll say when things we're good they were good. She was a phenomenal partner during these periods and I thing that's what I did I fell for her potential and quite honestly I believe in some ways she did the same.

During these periods in which I could evidently tell her interest she would do more (as I mentioned she'd never go as far as myself) but she would do more than just the bare minimum but I suppose I was expecting for her to love me in the same extravagant way I was her considering this is something we mentioned? I just never ever got to see the full side of that.

While I was always appreciative I always wanted more, and no as a man I should've been more upfront about it but I wasn't (yet again) I would say things like ""Hey babe, I really want to go to WWE or AEW when it come to town."", or things like ""Hey babe, I would really like to go to the Star Wars Orchestra in May."" Ya know things like that, I would've thought she would take the hint? But I suppose not.

But because of things like this and in addition to it the first time we ""tried"" to date she ended up fucking her ex not even three months in I realistically shouldn't have tried but I found myself continuing to try to make her love me fully I guess?

So after months of feeling as if I wasn't being heard, cared for, or at the very least the first option I began to do the same (no I was meeting with this women) but I was deceiving my girlfriend at the time. As the old proverb goes ""all things done in the dark must eventually come to light."" So of course she found out and was reasonable livid, and so an argument ensued I blamed her, she blamed me it was an entire debacle. Ah! Because I had almost neglected, she mentioned she was pregnant towards the genning of May, I at first didn't believe her as to this point she had been lying, sneaking, and changing passwords so realistically how could I? But then again I began doing some of those same things myself.

She went on to say ""You ain't shit nigga "", ""You're insecure"", ""You ain't never done nothing for me"", oh and the cherry on top of the cake ""Yep, I sure did go on a date with a guy the day after I told you I was pregnant."" I won't lie hearing those things really really really fucked me up. Because here I find myself in my third relationship and after doing all I literally can and financially can to the point where on the day of her abortion I still drove 13 hours and paid $650 for the surgery.

I won't lie the aftermath of all of this it really made me feel less than a man? Like obviously I can't blame her completely as I did my dirt also. But I just...how can you go on a date when you are pregnant with a man who proclaimed you ""loved"" baby? No matter, We did talk a few more times afterwards (because I at the very least wanted to make sure she was physically okay as I am the man who got her pregnant and also try to emotionally support here where I can). But I guess ultimately I just want to know what would you all do? I know at this point I'm rambling, but allow me to add also when she told me I was 8 hours away visiting family. But let's let it be known that when she was pregnant I was doing all I knew how, taking her to movies, running her baths, still attempting to be intimate. I genuinely tried I just felt like I could've done more? I just don't know if that's me or gaslighting (as overused as that word is now).

I find myself incredibly confused. As now I've done this dance twice with this woman and neither time has it worked. I am very unsure what to believe when it comes to her as in the beginning of our second tenure she was going ""hard in the paint"" so to speak. She also mentioned numerous times about how she believed we we're each other's ""twin flame"" now I am a spiritual man and even I fell into it. How intense our intimacy would be (not sex specifically) when we both would just relax and old one another and sit and talk for hours in some aspects she really was my best friend I suppose ultimately as conflicting as my emotions towards her and the situation. So any (reasonable) guidance would be nice."	Both_Pound4075	post	14.324717459459357	male	White	0.004411111585795879	na	na	na	3	BlackMentalHealth
"You are so young! 9 months is such a small amount of time. 

It seems that you guys brought out the worst in each other. Let it go. Stop wanting someone that doesn‚Äôt want you. If someone isn‚Äôt interested in you then there is nothing you can do to earn them. Nothing. Any attempts are a waste of time. Actually that‚Äôs not 100% true. I‚Äôm in a very long term relationship. There have been a few times where we both have had to stop and focus on the relationship. But we both put in effort and did the work. She was never interested in fixing the problem and honestly 9 months is such a short amount of time to lose interest. 

This is a toxic flame. Relationships are supposed to bring out the best in you. You‚Äôre both supposed to grow as a couple and as people. Getting back at each other and treating your partner like an enemy is never ok. Leave before that happens. In a relationship it‚Äôs never her vs you. It‚Äôs always both of you vs a problem. True partners work together for the life they want for their mutual goals and for both their needs. 

It didn‚Äôt work out. I‚Äôm sorry. The chances that anyone will find the person they will spend the rest of their life with at your age are so slim. You don‚Äôt know who you will be in 5 years. Cut ties and heal. Don‚Äôt ask why. It doesn‚Äôt matter. This isn‚Äôt some great love. Focus on being a better you. 

Life advice: Our partners are not mind readers. There are no hints. If you wanted to go see a show then go see a show with a friend or by yourself.

"It seems that relationships start out most times with people putting the best versions of themselves out, what is called their representative, and then they show who they are later on. So you two might have started off okay but ultimately she showed that she is not serious about you or being with you and did not respect the boundaries of your relationship, which led you to cheat also. Both behaviors are toxic, and not signs of a healthy relationship so it's best that you two are not together. Just know that a relationship should be equal effort and if they aren't bothered to try then they simply don't want to and you don't have to stay in a relationship with them. 

Also for the pregnancy, good that you two were able to get that done, because something tells me she was not mature enough for motherhood, also you need to absolutely take more precautions not to get a woman pregnant if you know you are not ready for a child yet, no matter what she says or how you feel in the moment that boundary needs to be respected by both of you, for you and your future childs sake, ask your doctor or school clinician  for information about how take preventative measures towards pregnancy when you are being intimate with someone. You are still in college this is not the time to bring a child into the world before you've created a financially and emotionally stable environment. 

Life is difficult, you don't want to make it more difficult for you or a baby by not being prepared and by not doing so with the right woman who has more sense and can reciprocate a healthy relationship. This sort of stuff takes time, so think about if you even want kids and plan wisely if you do. Unfortunately, you might come across people who aren't a good fit mentally or emotionally to partner up with, but if you do, you do not have to settle for an unhealthy relationship."

"The most disgusting part about being a dark skinned black woman navigating through a vicious world aimed at destroying any ounce of your mental health - Is the very real way that the collective of the aforementioned groups seek to **gaslight you, exploit you, manipulate you, abuse you and politically disenfranchise you**, while all at the same time **making it seem as if it's your fault, for simply being a black woman (As if you were born as the wrong gender (a black man) or the wrong race (a white women), or even the wrong color as we see with light skin ""black"" women)**

At the same time **they never like to talk about it either -** It's almost like bringing up the fact that these people get off on **dark skinned women's suffering** and  need us to be their punching bag to validate themselves - **it makes them feel uncomfortable.**

**But honestly they should feel uncomfortable** \- They contribute to the **ongoing traumatic stress**  (OTSD) that dark skin women have to face every day. They should get the honor of being reminded of how sick they really are since **they feel like it's okay to hurt dark skinned women, in that way simply, because they are dark skinned women.**

While they get to sit and feel comfortable/validated **in doing nothing and getting handouts**, they task dark skinned women specifically with building their **self-worth and self-confidence in a world where everyone denies them that** and most importantly in a world where **they never had to do that themselves.**

**So as a FYI to all the passport incels out there along with their ragtag crew of drag a'black girls barbies - dark black women are not your punching bags nor stepping stones**

**We get it!**  You think society would be **SO** much better if **REAL DARK SKIN** black women **didn't exist**, and **all that existed in the world was dark skin men and light skin girls with blue eyes and blonde hair** \- Well I'm sorry that my existence **bothers** you but you can kindly **go fluff yourself and learn self love instead of projecting onto girls like me.**"	IndependentWarm3917	post	25.538956396091315	female	White	0.9908047914505005	na	na	na	10	BlackMentalHealth
"I think black women in general r supposed to be the worlds punching bag because as a cis passing medium brown skinned trans woman I‚Äôve definitely felt attacked just for being a black woman in general. I won‚Äôt turn this into a trans thing, that‚Äôs another story all together!

People love to minimize‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt be a black woman and have a concern, some again, will stop at nothing to make sure ur concern gets brushed off.

I‚Äôm not cocky but I will not downplay myself or be downplayed for the amusement of comfortability of others around me.  

People love to silence‚Ä¶ U simply cannot complain or give constructive criticism as a black woman because how dare us not be happy with what we have gotten.

"I'm sorry that there's some weirdos here talking shit and literally proving your point.

You're allowed to vent that's the whole point of the sub. And, I agree with you. I hate how justified people feel in disparaging Black women, usually all for nothing. Best IRL example I have is how some of my non-black friends would proudly proclaim that they'd never give a black woman a chance. Like, ok? Is badge of honor to you or something? And why tell me, a black man, that you'd never give a black woman a chance? Are you seeking validation from me as you disparage my own people; women that I share community with? Fuck outta here with that shit. And I fully understand how that shit would hurt. I had an uncomfortable amount of women tell me the same thing, to my face, as if I'm some sort of punching bag for them to use. It's like they want you feel bad about being Black. They want to convince themselves that they're better than you by making you feel bad about yourself.

Not trying to give you advice but I personally just keep that shit out of my life now. I'm in my mid-20s so I have more autonomy to control whos around me now and I keep weird people like that the fuck away from me by all means. If you don't unequivocally fuck with black people or can't have black friends without constantly mentioning their race, I don't want you in my life. I've been staying off most social media because there's mad misogynists that be saying all kinds of weird shit about women in general and specifically BW whenever they get the chance. Passport bros like you already mentioned being one of them.

Social media made me believe that I was public enemy #1 as a BM. Worse when all I saw on my feeds were Black women and other races regurgitating the same shit about Black men. That Black women need to leave the Black community solely because of (insert racism) that Black men are. That shit made me feel like everything wrong with the black community was my fault and I need to personally atone for it. It destroyed my mental health for bit. What's wild is that I had a heart-to-heart with a Black woman in my life at the time about that exact thing, and she told me that she gets content that's the exact opposite of mine and that it was making her feel like BW are useless and just punching bags, similar to your point. She was getting content that was a bunch of Black dudes saying that we need to leave behind Black women and blaming them for it. We were able to comfort each other in that moment.

It's like social media hones in on your deepest insecurities and pushes you content that it knows will upset you. Not saying that it invalidates any of your experiences because it absolutely does not. But, I think taking a break from social media is key to keeping your mind healthy and free of bullshit.

"The fact that we're in 2023 and have made so much progress people still hang onto ignorant colorism. My oldest brother is married to a darkskinned woman, my daughter's Mom is somewhat dark no issues there. We respect and love them. In my family we're all shades, light skin, I'm buttermilk biscuit brown, and darkskin. I judge people by their actions and behavior. I don't understand why dudes like Kodak black and Gilbert Arenas had to announce they don't mess with darkskinned black women. If you don't fuck with them just let them be. We all have preferences but it's never an excuse to be ignorant and rude about it. 

You deserve better but I'm glad that you even in your disgust about the mistreatment you receive you have a strong love for yourself. That's one thing I've improved on starting last year. I'm a man not a darkskinned black woman but I had mental health issues and everyday I get my mind right by continuing to practice gratitude and forgiveness towards myself and others. Continue to love on you and keep shining. Darkskinned women have beautiful skin and bright shining white teeth.

The harsh truth is that some of you are and not just dark skinned women it‚Äôs black women in general.

"You can only ever know what someone else is thinking when they tell or do something to you.

As a Black person in the US, there's always going to be the chance that any person whose path you cross could harbor feelings towards you about your race. There's nothing you can do about that, nor can you avoid it. There's the *potential* for it in every meeting and interaction.

But if you go looking for it, you'll just drive yourself crazy, and there's nothing you can fix anyway.

I would try and find a way not to be too worried about what other people think of you. And it's **definitely** a losing game trying to guess how people feel about you - whether it's about racism or otherwise.

"Christianity is so fractured that an answer to this question requires a high degree of nuance.

Ultimately, it depends on who you ask. Some say yes, some say no, some say yes but with certain caveats.

As a lapsed Catholic I will tell you that Jesus Christ was a Jew, first of all. He started a movement yes, but would most certainly be appalled at the infinite divisions amongst those who call themselves His followers. 

If you wish to have an informed opinion on what constitutes a good Christian I would look to scripture, particularly the Gospels, and study the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. Your opinion is as valuable as some person who dresses in fancy robes or a sharp suit and preaches on Sundays.

"I know this feeling and I was talking to someone about it. But tbh I‚Äôve tried not to blame myself so much because I realize we live in a world where people don‚Äôt value friendships. Most importantly we don‚Äôt value the curiosity in getting to know someone and wanting to know them. I think there is an imbalance of people gravitating to people because of image and status, not for how they treat us or make us feel. Plus the societal relationship paradigms has us all fucked up. 
Just know that you are valuable and one day you‚Äôll find your people. I suggest going to places where you have common interests or interests groups.

"Yeah, its hard. Did you wind up starting therapy re: your last post?

I talk to my therapist about this a lot. I don't have a lot of friends and I'm at the point now where I'm ok with it. I've tried to maintain friendships I've had in the past but friendship is a two way street. I've done the work to realize that these people don't meet my definition of friends and let those connections go. I mean, I literally got a 'hey - what have you been up to!!!!' love-bomby message from somebody I haven't talked to in over 5 years. Tell me you're bored without telling me you're bored...

I suggest getting to know yourself, what you enjoy doing, and how you define a 'friend.' Now that I've deigned people who randomly reach out when they're bored at work, recently single, that I do activities with, who aren't actively anti-racist, (the list is long) as acquaintances and I will say that to them.  Those people don't have access to multiple aspects of my time, life, and energy. 

Friends are different, I share aspects of myself with them and prioritize them as other people do with their family. The most important thing is we consistently make time for one another despite being 'busy.' This is important since I'm estranged from my family. I have very limited social energy and choose to save it for the people I have a supportive and consistent connection with.

I hear of people on social media who ""have"" thousands of friends and will adamantly defend that they know and care for each of them or that the friendship is strong enough where they can subsist on talking once every 5 years and 'its like no time has passed.' I am happy for them, but my brain doesn't work like that and there's nothing wrong with saying, 'I need something different.'

Getting comfortable with my own company and enjoying solo time with a few meetups thrown in when I feel the need to be social has worked for me. I realize that finding friends is going to be a challenge because I'm pretty selective about who I spend my time with. I wasn't in the past and that lead to me feeling isolated and emotionally wrung out, often while being surrounded by a bunch of ""friends.""   

Good luck.

Sorry for the loaded answer. I can't really comment on the Trans issue. I've dated TransWomen but it's definitely a harder road then simply being Gay, Queer or Bi. I'm still attracted to women.

"As someone who came out Bi then gay lol last year I fell in love with another man. Sounds wild but we had an emotional connection beyond sex. I felt like his background and was so similar religions upbringing. He appeared to have ghosted me. Maybe he felt overwhelmed and wasn't ready for a full blown relationship. I was definitely somewhat hurt but I had mental health issues as well (he was diagnosed Bipolar and even though I don't see a therapist I've had issues for years). Towards the end of last year while learning about meditation, shadow work, forgiveness of myself and others, complete acceptance of who I am I had a breakthrough. I felt a weight lifted as I gradually let go of what was hurting me. In the process I let go of Religion as well. I've had supernatural experiences before so I definitely believe in the Spirit realm and God/Source Creator but not the idea of God, the insecure bearded man in the sky watching our every move. I'm gay and practice gratitude every morning. I no longer feel shame or guilt. I make mistakes, I still have dark days sometimes but it's making me stronger not causing me to lash out. Sex whether it's with the same or opposite sex between two consenting adults is ok. The ""Community"" I'm not typing all those letters is only different by orientation but whether they're gay, trans, queer, lesbian or non binary they are just as worthy of love, respect, food, clothing, shelter and understanding as everyone else. Just as shallow, narcissistic and engage in hookup culture just like heterosexuals. Orientation has nothing to do with character.   Don't beat yourself up.

Bro you can't sell your soul. But I definitely understand being in a dark place. Do you have anyone to talk to? I know it's rare because people who look like us don't like mental health conversations but If I had a therapist ten years ago it wouldn't have taken me so long to get to where I am now. The pain doesn't magically go away, it's a process. Everyday I have to say affirmations, try meditating, breathing exercises. It might sound corny but the breathing and positive self talk about what you're good at, who you want to be not necessarily who you are. It'll get better Fam.

 So I'm a mixed raced black dude, but I look fully black I'm not light skinned, but also not the darkest. I grew up, and currently live in Norway, and I have been raised by a white single mom(somebody gonna be on my ass for that one lmao.) My mom has always loved me, and supported me the best she could, and has give me a good set of morals, and values that I resonate with, and follow. There has been some moments here, and there where she has been ignorant, but she has gotten a lot better the last few years. Anyway in my 21 years on this planet living here I have had some issues, and I was wondering if any of you have dealt with the same thing, or maybe even someone dealing with them now, and how you cope/deal with it. So in norway if i remember correctly about 2% of the allready small population consists of people with african heritage. Naturally its not super common to see another black person for me, and I remember for the first 5 years in my school life I was the only black person in my school(I live in a tiny ass town btw, which i'm gonna move out of next year.) For the first like 7 years of school I was a loner, and got bullied, Id get called the usual nigger, people would say my skin looked like shit/poop, call me a monkey, say that I didn't belong her etc, but that stopped when I started growing(puberty obviously.) It became easier making friends, in secondary school, although most of my friends have always been white. Most of the black people here are african immigrants, and have not been raised here so they have a whole other culture, which makes it difficult for me to relate, and get along with them, language barrier is also a thing most times. Therefor I have had an Identity crisis for as long as I can remember, but it is better now. The experiences I have had, and the treatment I have gotten aligns with that of a black man, so I look at myself as such. I have also felt some guilt/internal struggle about is my attraction to white women. Its what I see the most of, and have been around so I have been told by therapists in the past that its only natural, although I find every race of women physically attractive. I dont know if this belongs here since I'm from a european country, feel free to remove the post if it isn't welcome, and I can post it somewhere else.

"Hi, I figure I can share this with others who may not have a biased opinion of me. I've been through a lot the past two years and things have really calmed down in my life to where I don't have to worry about a lot of things that caused me stress over a year ago. Despite that, I have a lot of feelings about some things that have happened to me. I have a spouse that I've tried talking to about these things but he just doesn't understand because they've never been in the situations I've faced in the past. I honestly feel like some kind of enigma. Due to some things I'd been through I had to be admitted to a mental hospital where I feel like they made things even worse, honestly. As a black female one of the things I've gone through time and time again is that I have ALWAYS been seen in a negative light. I have always been misunderstood and for whatever reason I have always been judged as a ""troublemaker"" or someone that just doesn't get along with people. Now I'm sure you're probably thinking ""Well people don't just form these assumptions for nothing.""

But they DO!! Just yesterday my mother made a comment about a friend of the family (I'm not super close with this person I do know her to a degree and we are on friendly terms) that this woman is slow ( as in stupid) and crazy. Now I had to take a step back when she made that comment and asked her why does she think this woman is crazy? Her answer was that ""She just acts weird"" So I pressed further and asked what about her is ""weird"" and she couldn't give me any other justifiable reason other than because SHE thought she was crazy and weird. So I had to correct her. The lady is anything BUT weird. She's not a super social person. She's quiet and stays to herself. She minds her own business! That interaction with my mother really made me realize people really be out here making BASELESS assumptions about people and really believing these crazy lies they tell themself!! So yes I strongly believe people make crazy assumptions about people coming out of the left field.

When people don't understand someone they automatically assume something is wrong with them instead of taking the time to get to know them first before forming a solid opinion about them. Yes, I'm completely aware of this fact, however, it still does not take away the pain and hurt that comes with the damage that has been dealt due to this.

I feel invisible because no one has taken the time to get to know the real me. I know my husband is the exception, but he's the ONLY exception. I've ALWAYS been the one who has been bullied, ostracized, and humiliated. I've experienced all of these things. Even the MANY times I tried to reach out to someone and ask for help only to be turned away. So these feelings are VERY strong. I absolutely HATE seeing others be ignored and disregarded because of their differences. I do make it a personal effort to make sure that whomever I cross paths with that they know I hear them and I'm willing to try and understand them. Because it's truly a very painful thing to feel completely unheard and invisible."	Redditerderrrr	post	26.07764567776179	female	White	0.013325435109436512	na	na	na	4	BlackMentalHealth
"I‚Äôve been on the receiving end of this many times through my life. For context I‚Äôm socially awkward at times, but I also have eclectic tastes compared to most black men. This is a recipe for unprovoked comments (behind my back) about being ‚Äúslow‚Äù/weird, as well as being laughed at by a group of other Black ppl whenever I walk past them, bc they‚Äôve convinced themselves that something is wrong with me despite evidence showing the contrary (maybe they‚Äôre projecting lol). All I do is keep to myself and mind my business, and I managed to attract these miserable assholes. I know it‚Äôs not all Black People (it has more to do with proximity than anything specific to Black ppl), but it is demotivating to expect at least basic respect only to be written off as a basket case bc of trivial stuff. Unfortunately these interactions have made me unconsciously weary of being in majority black spaces which I‚Äôm working past bc antiblackness ain‚Äôt cute (don‚Äôt worry, I know white folks ain‚Äôt shxt either and avoid those spaces whenever possible). At the same time I need to protect my mental health.

I used to rack my brain heavily about why this was a problem, and couldn‚Äôt think of anything. Then I heard a phrase a while ago that people retain the version of you they feel they can control. There‚Äôs no convincing these miserable demons. All that can be done is to tell them off if you‚Äôre able to (or even care to), and give them a wide berth.

I can relate to being understood. I'm going through a rough time. Back living with family. It's almost as if I can't make it on my own without them but it's completely true. I accept that I have issues. I don't see a therapist but I do self therapy but all I want is to get out of this situation. I don't look back into the past because I healed from it but even though I was once in the military and lived overseas that was then and this is now.

"I felt this same way too. I think if anything you should try to do things that you enjoy, even if you have to force yourself. This life is hard, it really is. Don't nobody tell you about the issues you'll face as an adult. This leads me to believe that people are so caught up in their own crap they're dealing with that they don't even have time to prepare their own children for the stressful life that is adulthood. It goes to show just how flawed society is. 

You don't have time to discover yourself and what it is you truly want because you're so busy just trying to survive and that goes double for us Black folk.

What piece of solid advice I can give you is to just be patient with yourself. If there is one thing I wish I did when I was younger it would have been this. Be kind to yourself and allow yourself the time to grow and do the things that will make you happy. Please ignore the pressures of society that tell you that you HAVE to be successful and that you have to achieve certain milestones within a specific time period. 

Most people don't know where they're going and those that do know are still figuring things out along the way. So there isn't a real right or wrong way to go about your life. So in everything you do make sure it's for the sake of your self and not because of what society may have imposed upon you.

I truly hope you find peace and you find a path in life that makes you happy."	Embarrassed_Web_8145	reply	na	na	na	0.9985892176628113	weak	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"I'm 21 year old black man and I've never had any close friends or relationships. What turns me off from getting close with others is a general hatred and distrust of everyone. Thankfully, I'm in therapy to address this very issue. CBT works really well for me but I don't have a clear strategy to expose myself to social situations. I've been working on eye contact and body language when ever I go out but I'm not any closer to interacting with other people. 

Now, I'm going to get raw so the people here can feel comfortable doing the same with me. I genuinely see most people as degenerate vermin. Being isolated is like choosing to keep away from the snakes in the grass. Being social, it feels to me, is like walking into a field full of snakes knowing full well you're going to be poisoned. I'm terrified of everyone because I know how ugly humankind can be. Nobody is worth getting to know because they can only hurt me. 



If I legitimately saw you, yes you, at my college library I would do my best to avoid you like the plague. And your attempts at expressing any social interest in me will be squashed. I will avoid and reject you like humanity has done to me the 21 years I've been alive. Every individual is simply apart of the machine that is against me. When I'm doing well and you're doing terrible, it's like watching ants being crushed beneath my boots. You isolate me, you hurt me and now I will keep away from you because you're just another snake like everyone else. 



This is how I feel whether I'm at the grocery store, gym, or library. Any public place where I have to be in the vicinity of strangers breeds this feeling. How do I disprove this shit to myself? Exposure therapy is supposed to be done together with CBT but like I said, I don't have clear strategy to go from hating humanity to talking to someone. I'm this close to getting my driver's license so that won't be a barrier to getting to know people but the general attitude I have towards people regardless of their race, culture, or age will still be there.  Avoidance feels like a superpower in the moment but I legitimately don't want to be alone for the rest of my life. Hope this wasn't too hard to read or too long.

"I think the problem stems less from yourself, and a mixture of your perception and reality. I completely empathize with your experience growing up, as I went through the same thing myself, but what I learned is that people have no reason to get me because most people aren't intentionally antagonizing.

In those middle school, high school, and even college environments, it's a brutal social hierarchy where children are quickly shuffled into their caste slot before they know what's happening.

But when you're out in the real world, just at the gym, or the library, or a group setting, most people are just doing the same thing you're doing. And the crazy part is? They don't think like you. They're just there. And if you're nice and polite and show genuine compassion you can talk to anyone you want.

The beautiful thing about life is that you have a fresh start with every new person you meet, you just act like a person that's welcoming, just have the presence of someone who seems caring, and people will just want to talk to you.

"When these thoughts come up you can do one of three things: 1. Distract the thought 2. Challenge the thought 3. Replace the thought

Try to think of exceptions to this feeling, is there a family member, teacher or anyone that was kind to you/made you feel good about yourself (if not then make up someone like this or use a movie or t.v. Character that has the energy of what you'd want in a friend)? Use this image and your desire for connection to help you challenge the thoughts.

Does your therapist do EMDR? This can help heal specific painful or traumatic memories. 

And remember that you can hurt others just as much as they can hurt you. Communication can be messy, use grace and forgiveness. Only share with people who have earned the right to hear [your deeper feelings/truth/goals]

I‚Äôm a current incoming PhD student (24F) and I‚Äôm about to finish up my thesis for my Masters program. However, I have no motivation and I feel so alone right now. This past year I ended up in a terrible emotionally abusive relationship. One where he tried to kick me out at 1am, kept being hot and cold to me, constantly projected his insecurities about infidelity, lacked consistency after we became bf/gf. He even punched a hole in a wall when he was upset over me asking a question about our partnership. While this happened I lost someone I consider a second mom. And I‚Äôve been suffering in silence. 

I find it so hard and I‚Äôm so disappointed in myself. I wish I didn‚Äôt end up here because I feel so trapped and emotional constantly. Before him I used to go out often and spend time with myself. But it‚Äôs so hard now because I want company but in don‚Äôt know how to leave. And I get it‚Äôs my trauma from growing up that‚Äôs making it hard for me to, but it‚Äôs fustrating when I want to have peace and leave but I also feel like I want to still be with him. Today I planned to leave and not see him again but I‚Äôm really struggling to even pass one day without him. Then on top of this I‚Äôm working 2 jobs and trying to finish my paper. 

I don‚Äôt have any motivation and I don‚Äôt have too many friends to talk about this wish or even hang out with. Most are really focused on their lives or partnerships. Which is so valid but I can‚Äôt help but really want a community. But it‚Äôs really hard.

"My kids' dad and I have separated this year after being together for 9 years and its been super difficult. We've been through therapy, we've been having great conversations but also we've been arguing alot too. And what I would hear in his communications in all 3 instances is all the childhood trauma and hurt under the surface. And boy it is a lot. And I'm also realising how that uprooted my own trauma and how it affected our relationship. Like trying to control me and put me down in a passive aggressive way so he can feel powerful.

As I explored the topic more with my friends and ny therapist I'm now seeing how these trauma appear in all my relationships. I can't say it enough CHILDHOOD TRAUMA is REAL and you need to heal from it! I think when people hear the word trauma their mind goes straight to sexual assault or physical abuse. It's so much deeper than that. It's all those moments the people around you made you feel disempowered or unheard.

It's good that school is your outlet and you can be who you really are there.

"So, for multiple reasons that seemed totally reasonable, my primary care provider and my previous psychiatric prescriber let me go on a low, low dose of Xanax for an extended period to deal with an issue. I'd done it before, and come off it before, with no problem whatsoever. 0.125mg, at bedtime, per day. A dose that my PCP was really skeptical would have any actual effect, let alone side effects, and was like, ""At that low a dose, you could quit cold turkey and not have a problem."" And I was like, ""Neat. I'm gonna taper off anyway, like I did the last two times,"" and I set up a plan with my psych prescriber, and started that. 

The withdrawal effects were IMMEDIATE, and HORRENDOUS. I had already been educated about what to be on the lookout for, and wham-bam-bam. There it was. So I went back on at the regular dose. And we tried swapping medications to something I could taper more easily. The next one made me so groggy, even at a quarter-pill, that I couldn't hardly function the next day. 

And the one I'm on now, I'm having terrible sleep (we're starting to suspect I may have a sleep disorder that's exacerbating all this, hooray), I'm unconscious but not actually *sleeping,* it seems like, and I'm groggy all day and fighting sleep by the afternoon, despite Adderall and caffeine, AND if I take less than my maintenance dose, I get the horrible withdrawal symptoms. I can't fucking win. 

So, I feel like at this point, I kinda need to get off this shit under medical care, because last night when I took half of my maintenance dose, I legit felt like I was about to have a seizure or something, which I know is a danger with benzo withdrawal. And I'm teetering on the edge of becoming non-functional just on a general basis. 

I'm not really sure what to look for, because I don't think I'm *addicted;* I don't feel driven to seek out more, or take more than the maintenance amount. Just as long as I take the same amount, like clockwork, I'll avoid the withdrawals. And I'll do anything it fucking takes to not take more. I just need to make sure I'm not going to have a seizure or something while I'm going off of it, and not have my family have to deal with the stuff that happens when I'm having symptoms, and not be expected to be at work. 

But I can ask my psychiatrist about that, I reckon.

"  I blocked my little brother about 6 months ago or so. His birthday is tomorrow. I was the last family member that talked to him.

   He isn‚Äôt a criminal. He isn‚Äôt violent. He‚Äôs just dramatic, selfish, and doesn‚Äôt take any accountability.

When I was the only person to talk with him, he lied about having cancer. He sold a car he bought from me to a junkyard.

In my personal experience, 6 months is not enough time to change ___ years of a person used to a lifetime of not holding themselves accountable. 

Accountability is a skill some people are required to develop and some aren't. Its unfortunate, but that doesn't make it untrue. Change is difficult, thankless, and extremely time-consuming. It also requires some form of accountability instead of a simple 'I'm sorry' which often equates to 'stop being mad at me, but I'm going to keep doing this.'  Its not something a person is typically able to do without actively maintaining things so they don't fall back into old habits. This is one of the main reasons, (again this is based on my experiences) people don't address mental health or addiction - it is a lot of work and it will change their lives. Many people seem to fear change even if they describe their situations as untenable. There are things we can't control (how we feel about something, systemic issues) and things we can (the actions we take and choices we make based on our feelings,) the longer we go without being held accountable, the harder it is to develop that skill.  

If it were me, I'd ask myself what the worst-case scenario is and if I have the time/energy for him in my life right now because opening the door will most-likely yield that result. Another suggestion I've seen in [estrangement](https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultKids/) and [narcissistic relationship groups](https://www.reddit.com/r/NRelationships/comments/13tw5q5/did_i_traumatise_him/) (I'm not saying he is or diagnosing him, just going off of the behavior) is to write a letter and not send it. 

If you decide to contact him, learn from the process and if you don't - learn from that as well. Society shames people for severing ties without knowing the history/backstory, at this point  I hope you remind yourself that prioritizing your peace and mental health is a perfectly valid reason to stay NC. 

Good luck."	LunarFrizz	reply	na	na	na	0.998468816280365	weak	no	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

I would rather be a slave of other's opinions than being a freedom fighter with many haters. What is wrong with me?	getyobre4dup	post	20.907275532606363	male	White	0.9939265847206116	na	na	na	2	BlackMentalHealth
"Nothing is *wrong*. You've just been conditioned into people-pleasing.

I think it happens when we grow up with traumatic experiences around interactions with people - we learn being ourselves is emotionally dangerous, so we learned to do what makes the people around us happy instead - and too often to our own detriment.

I'm guessing you had an emotionally immature or narcissistic adult/guardian(s) or likely some sort of consistent struggle around socializing as a child.

For me, it was due to having an emotionally immature mother (probably narc as well) *and* lots of struggles with socializing in early childhood (due to what I just recently learned is having ADHD).

What helped me was understanding that no matter what I did, I was never going to be able to make everyone happy all the time. So, I might as well at least prioritize my own mental peace and happiness.

The surprising thing was my relationships improved when I started having my own opinions, feelings, ideas, and boundaries and sticking to them despite my fear of the contrary.

===

Sorry, you're going through all this. I hope you can find a way to move past these challenges.  Therapy is always a good choice, but you could also look into CBT techniques to help shift your thinking - that's what helped me.

I‚Äôve been in this group therapy program for almost two years. And now my mother gotten involved. She on the phone telling them all these lies about me saying that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for her to talk and think for me‚Äù when I don‚Äôt. She told my therapist stuff over the phone and now got them thinking I‚Äôm the fucked up one. She constantly yells at me about ‚Äúhow she had to deal with me all these years‚Äù like I‚Äôm some kinda case to her. I feel like I‚Äôll never get to tell my side of anything because whenever I do I get shut out. I‚Äôm the bad one. My mother knows how to talk up something to people to get them to think I‚Äôm the problem. I grew up a very shy kid with no confidence and my mother used to beat on me because I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúflashy or outgoing‚Äù like she wanted me to be. My mom would say things like I was ‚Äústuck-up‚Äù as a kid and I still remember to this day. It hurt. Just now she started talking about how she wanted me ‚Äúgrown‚Äù as a teenager and I felt like I‚Äôve never enjoyed my teen years because of it. I had no social life. Never did. And I was forced to grow up to soon. And now my mental health is impacted by it and she‚Äôs mad. Like I said I‚Äôm on a waiting list to move out but it‚Äôs through the program I‚Äôm in.

"Is there any way you can be out of the house, like in a quiet park away from your mother, when you're on these therapy calls? Could you message/email the therapist and ask them to tell your mother that her input is not needed? 

If you no longer feel safe with this therapist, and you feel that your mother is actively turning them against you, you might be able to ask for a different one, and arrange your appointments at a time when you know your mother won't be around so she can't interfere.

The worst thing to do in this situation is to say nothing, and then quit the therapy. That will only leave you feeling isolated and frustrated. So get in touch with the therapist privately, and explain that you're upset and worried that your mother is turning them against you, and that you need them to tell your mother that she is no longer welcome in your therapy sessions.

If the therapist isn't willing to do that, ask them to refer you to someone else or to a different therapy group. If that's not possible, or if it is but you have to wait for that to happen, having your regular sessions in a different location away from your mother would be the next best thing."	crazygurl3	reply	na	na	na	0.999316930770874	no	no	strong	na	BlackMentalHealth

"I've been meaning to make a post about trying to find a nurse practitioner for med management, but for different reasons (move, etc.) so I hear you and wish you luck on finding someone who can see you consistently. Its a struggle to keep opening up to people only to realize that they can't meet your needs.

I have a few suggestions for venting and interim support but I don't know if they'll be helpful to you. The thing that saved me (when I didn't know I needed it) was journaling. I eventually fell into a habit where I could write down everything that I was dealing with, then go back and look at it as a way to notice patterns. Sometimes writing it down helped enough in the moment, and other times what I figured out became something to talk to with my therapist and since I'd written it down/condensed it, I could spend the session talking about it versus ranting the whole session and not come to any conclusions about what to do next. There are of course, some things that we can't solve. Journaling helped me figure out the difference between the various situations and then I could talk to my therapist about how to manage things that are 100% outside of my control that other members of society either don't care about (because it doesn't impact them) or chooses to pretend doesn't exist. 

The other suggestion was considering a warmline. I know its not the same/as effective as therapy but it may help when you're 'in the soup' as someone I talked to once said. I volunteer with a line and we don't 'report' people for having S/I but we're legally required to contact emergency services if there is a person who is actively planning self-harm or harm to others. In this setting, I talk to people who are experiencing S/I and--as I know from experience--there are times when just talking about where you are and the way you feel is enough.

"I am so glad you posted. It sounds crazy to say but I'm glad you can express the feeling that no one cares, and I don't even know what else to say other than I have been there

In another post I talked about my therapist helping me learn that my feelings are **valid**, but they may not necessarily be **true**. And both of those things can coexist. We went round and round and round before that finally began to make sense to me 

I think most therapy appointments are 50 minutes?

I think once you do connect with a therapist, having a plan for what to do after hours/between sessions would be good. You can ask for that. It's your therapy, and you can take ownership that way. And if the answer is unsatisfactory to you then you can make the choice to find another 

My experience is that you kind of have to be in a medium to large size city to have any hope of finding a good black therapist like 400,000 or more population

How do you feel about online? Because I believe therapists are regulated by state? and almost every state has a city that large, which might increase your chances of finding somebody? I'm assuming you're in the US?

"I felt this hard when I was younger, and occasionally still. Have always been proud of my blackness, but still feeling ostracized because I supposedly ""acted white"". Really I was just very shy and into nerdy hobbies, but obviously kids internalize what makes a ""real"" black person pretty hard. 

When I first started college (PWI too) I tried to fit in again, but I very quickly got tired of trying to be someone I wasn't. I would keep getting asked ""are you ok? Why are you so quiet?"" simply because I didn't have much to say to brand new ppl. I would hang out with my cousin's friend group a few times and all they really talked about were celebs, drama, and people *they* knew that I didn't know; I would try, but I truly didn't have much to offer for input.

Eventually they dropped me, likely due to this and the fact that I was just ""weird"" compared to them. But I did eventually find other black/POC friends like me, because like any other race we're not a monolith. One thing tiktok has been great for is showing all the alt, nerdy, neurodivergent etc. black cultures that have always existed.

The only music we listened to in the house was one Bob Marley CD on repeat, and only when we were in the car. All the other music I had to really work to find.

This meant I only had extremely niche hobbies and interests compared to my peers. I was very under socialized. I simply couldn't follow along with any normal conversation. Even now, people are frequently surprised how little actors or movies I know. I would try to catch up, but I'm dealing with issues regarding that, mainly rubbing in my face the life I never had and likely never will have. No matter how much interest and attention I show others, that remains a permanent wall.

"I was in that situation. Although I had black friends, most of my friends were white and of other ethnic groups.

"I deleted Tiktok, Instagram, FB, etc, a few years ago because it was putting a huge strain on my mental health. I was still struggling with a host of issues involving my relationship with my race and my identity. Seeing weird posts online only fueled it since I was actively working on it instead of ignoring it. I went cold turkey for a while.

A few months ago, I dipped my toes back into it feeling more healed and having the desire to see more of the obviously non-inflammatory and mostly comedic stuff that you'd find online. I slowly gravitated towards a lot of pro-black content which obviously led me into a lot of ""hot takes"" and other dumb shit that gets tossed around and ended up taking another hiatus.

Recently, I only redownloaded Instagram just that way some of my friends could send me the dumb memes they see online and I got sucked into it again but was being as cautious as possible about what kind of content I engaged with and strictly avoided any content that was racial in its nature. I even used the ""I don't want to see content like this"" function every single time I found something of that nature. STILL, I get a ""joke"" about (TW: racism)>!a black woman referring to herself as Curious George (a monkey) and her white boyfriend as her owner (the man in the yellow hat).!<Again, something that probably didn't bother whomever made it but is really disgusting to see posted publicly. It makes me feel ""soft"" but that shit bothers me, makes me feel weird and travel down paths that I've been through and revisit trauma and ways that I've been treated. I don't want to see that kind of content and it seems like I can't use platforms like that without being shown stuff like that. I'm getting better but I'm actively healing from this stuff. Seeing that kind of shit feels like salt on a wound right now.

The closest I can get to moderating the kind of content I see is reddit by mostly following niche subs with specific subjects and, even then, it'll slip through the cracks here and there. This is a big part of the reason I can't really follow subs like many ""black"" spaces on social media, even on reddit (e.g. blackpeopletwitter/blackmen/blackladies/etc.), because 95% of the popular content there is just divisive gender war ""BM need this"" ""BW need this"" kind of arguments.

What's wild is how different it is IRL. The internet would make you believe that BW and BM cannot get along while various statistics and such get tossed around but I'm still yet to see most of these actual discussions happen in-person and in community. Moving towards being more involved in my community has been helping me heal. Sharing community and having discussions with actual black folk have been a large turning point in my mental health journey.

"The internet algorithms will always push the content that gets the most clicks.  Upvoting/downvoting systems like reddit will always be driven by what gets the most attention as well.

Yes, it is a problem because it gives a highly distorted view of the world, esp. in the case of reddit-like upvote/downvote systems where the bias of the majority of users gets tossed in too (in reddit's case USA white men between ages 15-35ish).

Unfortunately, you can't fix the entirety of the internet.  All that can be done is trying to help those around you in real life.  Do what you can with what you can control, and simply accept that the sky is falling everywhere else.

"One of the main reasons I use this site is because its text-based vs. image-based and I am able to use plugins, etc. to keep the videos/images down. I do appreciate getting to talk to people that I wouldn't be able to talk to otherwise.

I don't like/use social media. I tried it and when the great migration from myspace to fb happened I didn't see a reason to change it. At first people were like 'its great, you can talk to people from high school/your past, etc.' and I was like, 'if I wanted to be talking to somebody I went to high school I'd be doing that already' which is true. 

Then it became, 'oh I hate it so much, its so negative.' When I'd say 'why don't you leave the site' it became 'oh well its how I stay in touch with distant relatives and whats going on with their lives' etc. Like, you can't call or write I guess. 

Over time, I've been able to spend less and less time on social media because it makes my brain hurt in a bad way. People I know don't talk, they just send memes.

A scientist covered the ways that social media dictates behavior and as many have said before us, its all about the money. If it gets eyes on it, it makes money and that's the end of anything like morality, etc.  Anyway, [their blog post](https://wokescientist.substack.com/p/surveillance-capitalism-i-how-digital) really resonated with me.

My first time seeing an OB, I was having excruciating pain in my side, and I assumed it was because of my IUD. When I went there, she instantly gave me a dissatisfied look, and I told her my problems and concerns and I was really nervous because this is my first time ever going to an OB/GYN. So after I told her my concerns, she just looked at me and said well, it‚Äôs common for black women to have issues with their uterus. I told her I‚Äôve never had problems before. She asked me my sexuality and I told her I was bisexual and she said oh well have you been with any girls lately and gave me a nasty look I told her no I‚Äôve been with my long-term boyfriend for the past three years and she sort of just scoffed under her breath. And I eventually got to the point where I just said, I was looking for any type of relief because I am not trying to have a baby and I just want the pain to stop. She eventually told me that maybe I should just lose some weight I didn‚Äôt have any problems. I basically had to beg her to check my IUD, and eventually she did and she looked at me after she inspect it and said well if it‚Äôs fall out or I‚Äôm gonna pull it out and she yanked it out of me without my consent. There was no discussion as to if I could have any Tylenol or anything before hand. I overall just felt very disgusted with myself.	elleni_	reply	na	na	na	0.0014032310573384166	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"""Wrong"" in quotes because even though I know mental health isn't anything to be ashamed of, it's sure hard to feel that way when society and family says otherwise. With my family they've never been outright abliest, just enough for them to not believe most of us, including me, could ever have mental illness... despite all the anxiety and weird behaviors I've had since being a child. 

One thing I remember that happened a lot (much less now but it still pops up) is that I'd have random times where it's like my brain would stutter and trip over itself, resulting in these weird moments where I couldn't say a word straight/had to be mute for a few seconds. My dad especially hated that shit, and it was years down the line where the only explaination I could give was ""that's just the way my brain is sometimes, it's not like I'm doing it on purpose."" 

He tries to understand but it doesn't really click with him, despite him likely having mental issues to that led to him being a high-functioning alcoholic for years. My mom has OCD (from what she's always told me anyway) and she too hardly believes any other mental illnesses are possible for black folk. My youngest sister is finally getting checked for ADHD now that it's gotten too bad to ignore, despite my mom ignoring all of my pushing to get my sister checked since she was in 3rd grade (she's gonna be a highschool freshman now).

I wish I could just have an exact answer as to why I'm the way I am. I'm 98% sure it's some kind of anxiety disorder, but sometimes I feel like there has to be more than that. I've even began to suspect autism to some degree, but being black + poor + afab + adult age is a sure bet that I'll likely never know, since even if I could get diagnosed they'd probably label me with anything else before that. I can't even afford the therapy I so desperately need, and probably won't for a long while. Till then all I have is weed, which has helped in some ways but ik it's a habit I should cut down on.

Even worse is that I found with research that women/afabs with autism especially are overlooked because a lot have mastered masking by adulthood. When learning about masking a lot resonated with me, espeically with how I learned to hide my anxiety and social awkwardness from people who would easily attack that. Most of the time I have a good handle on it, but on days where the anxiety gets really bad it's like I've reverted back to my middle school self: self-loathing and feeling pathetic about what little I've accomplished compared to what my family envisioned for me.

In high school I got good enough grades to get honors, by the end of college I would pray to at least get a C. I thankfully graduated, but I have regrets with not being able to achieve ""black excellence"" like many of my peers. I tried taking a leadership position for a club I really liked, ended badly. I did an internship but it doesn't relate that much to my field and even still I barely managed to complete that. I'm average in every way, which wouldn't be a problem if I wasn't black; we're taught we have to be amazing to get the edge on mediorcre white ppl, so now the anxiety is getting bad since I have to look for a full-time job and compete.

My partner has been getting on me about getting my portfolio and applications out, which I know was on me to do before college ended. It's just that I still feel braindead from all the energy college sucked from me, especially with a senior project, internship, and part-time job at once. It's still not an excuse, but it's extra pressure since atm my partner can't look for a job due to summer classes. So every time they tell me I should've done it months ago all I can do is agree and go quiet, since I'm getting this close to just screaming endlessly if they or another person asks me about it. 

I have started, but I'm still so slow. It's only been a month and already I have to do more work, 1 month break for the whole 4 years of work I've done. Ik that's life and I'm in a better spot compared to some, I just wish I knew how to better help myself with all the internal bs."	pussycatvent	post	25.68907752427601	female	White	0.99286288022995	na	na	na	1	BlackMentalHealth
"Hey friend, I feel you on so much of this. 

I have word recall issues and other features of ADHD + medication side effects that make me go, ""...uh...uhmm...uh,"" when everything grinds to a halt up there, or just pause for long stretches while I try to get my words together, or even remember what words are. It's not like an, ""Oh, it's on the tip of my tongue, I know the word, I just can't think of it..."" It's like the whole goddamn concept has disappeared, and my brain goes, ""Ooh. No. Wait. Something ain't right. I gotta restart and see if it comes back."" 

I also legit feel that, ""OMG, if one more person asks me for one more thing..."" and the fact that getting started is super hard, and the more stuff, and the longer it goes, it only gets harder to ""just"" get started. It's common with ADHD; it's also common with plain old burnout. And that's not an ""excuse;"" that's a *reason.* Being exhausted and burnt out from giving your all, in too many places, while people demand more and more from you, and you're stressed as hell, isn't laziness. It's debilitating. 

Even if you don't have ADHD, some of the ideas in the Job Accommodation Network's [suggestions for ADHD on the job](https://askjan.org/disabilities/Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity-Disorder-AD-HD.cfm#ideas) could be useful. They are geared toward the workplace, but there are links to information, products, services, and practices in there that are great for organization, focus, time management, etc. 

And when you're in a workplace, you can subtly ask for some of these things, if you think you need them, or outright go through the process for securing ADA accommodations. The JAN has [an A-Z index](https://askjan.org/a-to-z.cfm) of every situation covered by the ADA, so there might be something else in there that you can use, too, if you're in the U.S.

"I don't know what it is but I've noticed that even in so-called good neighborhoods, other men be dying to start confrontations.

Everywhere I go I be an outsider or the new nigga in the hood so I'm used to the staring and mean-mugging or even random attacks suffice it to say.

But nowadays it feels like it's OD. Men refusing to get out of your way on the sidewalk, even when you're on the right side and giving them plenty space. Then they ""accidentally"" shoulder check you.

Try crossing a road at a crosswalk. A car from a ways away will speed up and pass you within inches, trying to intimidate you into running or something. I maintain my pace and stare them down instead, although I know it's a matter of time and probabilities that it will offend someone enough to escalate further. Reminds me of a couple years ago when I was in a town, in front of my car, waiting to cross a road. The dickhead jerked the wheel all of a sudden like he was feinting to run me over, knowing I had nowhere to run.

A couple weeks ago I'm walking to a cafe tryna get a coffee. Two loud ass borough rats behind me, one of them yelling talking about ""man this *been* my block yadda yadda"". When they approached, I can't really explain it - it's like my mind was fully prepared and visualizing my death, like I could literally feel a blow to the back of my head, a bullet touching my hair and entering my skull. I didn't look back (the way this stupid game works is that if you look back you're a mark), but I monitored them through my peripheral using reflections on the building next to me. They passed me and didn't say another word, but the mental strain was just tiring...

Or even better, I could just be standing minding my business, and they be clutching and covering their women like white women do with purses. Like I'm finna just up and yoink their shorties on some weirdo movie shit.

It's like people refuse to see me as human, just a challenge to their masculinity. Or just a toy where the challenge is to do increasingly disrespectful violations to try and get me to react.

I'm very used to violence and general fuckery, but it's very frustrating that this keeps happening in better neighborhoods, despite being very careful not to offer any confrontational energy.

Like I gotta deal with these white men following me, road raging in trucks, petty political warfare, security guards and feds trying to intimidate me, etc. I'm not trying to have to deal with these bitch ass niggas too. *I pay too much in rent to have to deal with this shit.*

By the way, for those who think I'm some sort of tough guy keyboard warrior extraordinaire, realize *this is not fun.* It's not cute.

"I‚Äôm clear on the fact that I didn‚Äôt come into the world with these issues. They were given to me. I am a black male that was born very in tune with my authentic way of being and was naturally non-conforming. Being black and male comes with VERY RIGID social expectations, and I naturally had no hang ups with embracing aspects of self that fell outside of those norms such as being in tune with my emotions, having empathy, and not being so consciously rigid in my mannerisms (I mean, who doesn‚Äôt want to just be themself, right? ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). However, with that came constant invalidation from my parents. I eventually internalized this and started beLIEving there was something wrong with me, that I was less than, and that I wasn‚Äôt good enough as a male, especially since I didn‚Äôt feel validated and valued by the male figure in my life (this ultimately caused me to lack major confidence in my masculinity, blocking a healthy flow of that energy). Hell, around age five or six I was even being made fun of by my mother for not having a deep voice and being told ‚Äúput some bass in your voice‚Äù. I then went out into the world and had society add to these issues. I really grew to hate myself, and these issues followed me into my teen years and adulthood. It all starts at home, and my parents gave me a very weak foundation to build my life upon. However, I‚Äôve been doing the work on myself to heal and have made progress that I‚Äôd never thought I‚Äôd make, but I still realize that my life could‚Äôve been so much better, richer in so many good things.

Good luck with setting up therapy. You might want to go ahead and start looking now as a lot of places aren't taking new clients or have long waitlists for new clients. This is a good time to do some self-reflection around what you want your therapist to focus on and interview therapists. If they don't feel like a good fit, you can find another one.

"I‚Äôve been seeing my therapist for about 3 months. I thought she was pretty good. I started seeing her for EMDR for PTSD that I developed after experiencing after experiencing sexual harassment at work. I thought it was going well. However, I was on a solo vacation for a week and experienced quite a bit of sexual violence and some body shaming. I told her about it and it felt like she spent her time trying not to judge me. I described the events without calling it sexual violence or rape and she was like ‚ÄúAs long as you had a good time.‚Äù I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have a good time! That guy was trying to rape me.‚Äù
She‚Äôs like ‚ÄúOhhhhh.‚Äù
I asked her ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt that clear?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo that wasn‚Äôt clear.‚Äù

It felt like I was being retraumatized, because ppl didn‚Äôt believe me when I told them I was being harassed and that‚Äôs why I developed PTSD.

Then I told her about the body shaming and she told me to pick my battles and the guy who shamed me didn‚Äôt matter because I wasn‚Äôt going to see him anymore.

She asked me ‚ÄúDid you go there looking for love?‚Äù No. But I didn‚Äôt go there to experience SA or disrespect either.

And when I told her I wasn‚Äôt going to that spot for vacation anymore, she said ‚Äúwell I had a great time there! you went by yourself.‚Äù 

And I already felt bad that I had to go alone. I wanted to go with friends but they were either trying to save money, can‚Äôt leave the country because of their immigration status, or don‚Äôt like the beach. She was like ‚ÄúWho doesn‚Äôt like the beach?‚Äù

"Hey, everyone wants two things in life. 
That is to be ""witnessed"" and ""approved"".

That is to say, I see your lived experience, and I understand why you show up as you do. I may not fully agree with it, yet I see it, understand (or seek understanding).

When we don't get it as children, this creates wounds, and often times we seek sources outside of ourselves after that time has passed.

Why am I sharing this?

Those who work as mental health professionals are expected to 'witness' and 'approve' the lived experience of those they serve (also, teachers coaches, parents, caregivers and so on). That's why these jobs are burdensome.

The interaction you described with your therapist shows she didn't 'witness' you, and she didn't 'approve/understand or seek to understand' how you showed up in the your challenging moment. 

The decision you make is yours what you do with that. What has helped me in those situations is stating my piece, then moving on (and set boundaries from her). 

This experience with your therapist is a benefit to you so that you might learn what kind of people not to align with and who won't help you met your needs. 

I'm wishing you all the best on your journey bro.
For what it's worth, there's a person out there through the screen who sees you were in a precarious position trying to make sense of it (I'm not here to judge if you put yourself in the situation or didn't). For what it's worth, you were just trying to make sense of it and she wasn't helping.

"TLDR: How did you learn to self-soothe when you need physical affection?

Hello ladies! Im seeking some advice on self-soothing. My primary love language has always been physical touch and quality time. 

Several years ago there was an incident of SA. I did not speak or even think of it until very recently when I was able to take a LOA; I basically buried it my mind. I‚Äôve realized the impact it‚Äôs had on my life now. I need so much more affection from my partners. I thought it was just the way I am and to an extent it is but since then I‚Äôve needed wayyyyyy more than I used to and I see now that it‚Äôs not normal. 

I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I don‚Äôt really know how to self-soothe. Reading, working out, hanging out with friends, etc is great. But at the end of the day after I‚Äôve gotten in bed I always go back to the mental place I was after the incident when I laid there in the fetal position for hours until the Sun came up and all I wanted was for my girlfriend at the time to come and care for me. 

I feel like that‚Äôs why I crave skin-to-skin contact at those particular hours of the night every night. A few people have been able to make me feel safe but I can‚Äôt keep looking for other people to save me. And I‚Äôm single now. I have to save myself.

And being African didn't help either because they mocked my last name too. I used to talk about my experiences getting bullied. Sadly, a lot of my bullies were black. One person said he didn't want to hear about them because he didn't want to admit that there are black people who belittle other black people who don't fit the stereotype, but he was more willing to discuss why white supremacy is a problem. While it is an issue, it's sad that some black people will refuse to acknowledge that some black people feel like they don't fit in as if it's their personal problem and that the bullying wouldn't happen if they just acted like the majority. 

No black person deserves to be bullied for liking things like rock music, anime, anime based card games like yugioh and vanguard, and other things that aren't stereotypically black."	fanime34	post	17.491967460597813	female	White	0.9981787204742432	na	na	na	13	BlackMentalHealth

"Sigh bc it‚Äôs a generalization. There are no rules to blackness. There are no rules on speech, clothing, hair, or culture. Childhood bullies have neither the knowledge nor authority to deem someone anti black. What they did do is bully bc their victim did not fit in with them or the people around them. 

If a black kid that grew up in say Memphis suddenly was placed in a New Orleans‚Äô middle school then that kid would speak different dialects of AAVE. The clothes they wore or food they ate would be different. Imagine if the Memphis kid showed up on their first day with say homemade bbq for lunch blasting local Memphis artists. The New Orleans kids would bully them bc kids are stupid and bully anyone different. ‚ÄúWhy do you talk like that? What are you eating? That‚Äôs not bbq. That‚Äôs not black food. What are you listening to? That‚Äôs not our music.‚Äù The Memphis native is no less black than the New Orleans natives. 

Im sorry kids made fun of your last name. If you grew up in an area that had a large population of African immigrants or children of African immigrants then your last name wouldn‚Äôt have been an issue. You didn‚Äôt and kids are stupid but by saying your childhood bullies somehow represent every single facet of black culture is just as stupid. Those kids were ignorant of the totality of black culture. 

You didn‚Äôt find your tribe growing up. That sucks. That experience shaped your and other kids‚Äô ideas of blackness but as an adult the person should be able to realize that stereotypes are stereotypes. They‚Äôre always harmful. 

I found my tribe. The kids I grew up around loved Dragonball Z. We all loved Pok√©mon and other anime. Paramour was ok to listen to. Linkin Park was blasted. We did all think the kid that ran with his arms behind his back at full speed was weird. Herman had a growth spurt started wearing deodorant grew into his ears and stopped running in the halls. He found his tribe in high school. Hopefully kids that were bullied can find theirs and heal trauma.

I'm thankful to see other black people addressing this problem. I'm someone who's constantly having to tell others (at my HBCU might I add) that being black doesn't mean being ghetto, going to clubs/parties 24/7, and and skipping class. Part of the reason I came to an HBCU was to find other black students who had a drive for success who also struggled with being authentically themselves in our very stereotypical community.

I think you might be missing some context  for that comment. There were some conversations on Twitter over the past couple of months. There were some men that talked about being ignored, lonely and mocked over their interests when they were in high school. Some women pointed out the nerdy Black boys at their school just chased after white girls that weren't interested in them and ignored the nerdy Black girls. Then there was a man that said he found a nerdy Black girl and they enjoyed anime and other stuff together. I think that is what the comment referred to.	fanime34	reply	na	na	na	0.9981787204742432	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"Here's me: don't like basketball or other sports(besides martial arts), am a nerd and can tell you more about Star Wars lore than NBA playoff scores or NFL draft seasons. Also am neurodivergent(autism + ADHD), so these things meant I simultaneously I made little to no genuine friends in my childhood or teens, and the few I have now I don't talk with too often due to adulting. I don't drink or smoke, partly due to job reasons, but also because of ADHD meds and just not being my thing anyway. I know black culture can be fairly extroverted(parties, cookouts,etc) and while not saying I could never tolerate those settings I am not one of those who would ''live it up'' a whole lot. Also have never had a girlfriend or been kissed/still a virgin. Yeah I know people say find happiness with yourself and such, but we are social creatures and it sucks to feel like you are missing out on the physical/emotional initimacy and companionship other people are.

I guess I am fairly introverted but how much of that is inherent of just due to lack of formative socialization is up for debate. Considering the fact I still get asked if I played basketball(and also noted that despite being almost 23 I still pass for a high schooler looks wise) people would definitely expect me to moreso be the big man on campus type. Varsity basketball, no problems having friends or a girlfriend, socially competent and outgoing...basically the opposite of what I actually am. And even if I was neurotypical I that's not how I want to be, but I wish I wasn't so behind my overall life goals or feeling so empty/like a failure. 

Family was also pretty dysfunctional(arguments, fights, broken things, suicide, etc) which I know isn't unheard of for black families or even other ethnic groups honestly. But with my friends who had a better upbringing in that regard there is some envy and subconsciousness even.

"Some of the things you listed aren't specifically typical black stuff like drinking, smoking, and not being a virgin. Drinking alcohol and smoking is usually stereotyped for party people, but I can see what you mean. I don't think it's necessarily stereotypical that black people aren't virgins either. But maybe the stereotype that black men are always sexually active could be one. I'm actually asexual and aromantic, but possibly demiromantic and demisexual. 

I find myself to be an atypical black person because I prefer rock music over rap and hip-hop. I don't even like those genres. I don't say the n word because I got bullied sometimes for ""talking white"" and I somewhat internalized that and it does sounds weird when white people say it; so with the way my voice sounds, I would actually be disgusted if I said it. Eventually as I got older I would later be told that I sound intelligent by some of these same black people, but that came off as black people thinking that they sound dumb, which made me feel weird. Most of my closest friends weren't black, or at least they weren't the stereotypical black kids (I did have black friends, most were atypical black).

"As a fellow neurodivergent black person, I relate to your experience accurately. It's important to understand and remember that stereotypes such as the ones you mentioned while prevalent in the black community, should not be the only form of black culture. 

I'm not African American but I am African and even living back in my country, the way that African American people were viewed at is precisely the same way you said: basketball, cookouts, etc. It's not a bad thing just limited. 

Unfortunately, this same culture has issues like all others with people who don't fall in the norm. I imagine you feel alone even with people you care about; it's nothing against you because communicating is one thing and understanding is another. I can infer from your story that people barely do the latter. I speak from experience. Personally, it lead me to involuntary Isolation then into voluntary one. 

All in all, our communities need to do better and have awareness as well as understand that individual traits are not threats to our norms but rather new perspectives that cultivate us. At least, this is my view. Having communities is part of our culture and supporting one another is the main reason we have it. Hopefully, we'll become more compassionate than judgemental.

You're not undesirable or a loser simply because of those instances. You can still potentially get a better job in the future. Contacting HSV 1, however it happened, isn't your fault and it can heal with treatment. The fact that you haven't dated is okay. I never got my chance. There are chances.

"Wow, thank you for sharing how you really feel. To me, this seems like you want your life to change, you want to be alive to experience a different life. It‚Äôs really hard however to imagine that change being feasible. 

You want friends. You know it requires socializing. You have anxieties about socializing. You don‚Äôt socialize. You don‚Äôt find friends. This cycle is changeable. 

But changing that cycle won‚Äôt be comfortable. It‚Äôs not comfortable now for you though so I hope you continue on anyway. 

Here are some suggestions:
What are things, hobbies, etc do you want to get into? Or already into? Learning a bit on your own gives you something to talk about. You can even go to events specifically about that hobby so you know folks are interested. It also opens you up to online meeting spaces. 

Virtual healing groups‚Äî BEAM is focused on Black LGBTQ folks. Family Equality has some virtual groups as well. Inclusive Therapists might have some leads. 

So much of our oppression is because of capitalism and the ways that it extracts our livelihood for profit and condenses the human experience into ‚Äúwhat do you do for a living‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next for you?‚Äù I wonder if you would find solidarity connecting with folks who are also over those sorts of questions about productivity. I wonder what community organizing groups are in your city or are having events virtually. Joining social justice movement was a great boon for my socializing. But it can get messy there like it can anywhere.

You can also try writing scripts and having prepared answers for common questions so that you don‚Äôt get overwhelmed. This was especially helpful for me because I would get overwhelmed by the question ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù For me the answer would be everything and nothing at the same time.
It felt impossible to be both concise and vulnerable in order to maintain or establish friendship. But writing down the answers ahead of time helped me craft a better response.

In terms of herbal support, I recommend the tincture ashwaganda or holy basil. For me, I noticed a difference after about a month. It doesn‚Äôt make me endlessly happy. It does not cure depression or anxiety. It does help me stabilize enough to be more present. 

There is no quick fix solutions. But there are next steps. You might need to do multiple of these things."	MCKC1992	reply	na	na	na	0.9994706511497498	weak	no	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
"TW- mentions of self-harm and suicide.

Hi, i‚Äôm f17 in my last year of hs. Ever since the beginning of last school year (sept 2021) my mental health has been deteriorating and I just recently gained the courage to open up about how I‚Äôve been feeling with my dad. For the most part he has listened and helped me in whatever ways he can- however, a few days ago I told him about how I think I have something called bpd and as I was telling him WHY I thought so, he googled it and cut me off by reading the symptoms in a ‚Äúgirl wtf are u talking about‚Äù kinda way. He read all of the symptoms out loud (15 of which i struggle with daily) and he specifically stopped on two of them. (We talked about a lot more but I don‚Äôt want to be writing all day)

The first one he stopped on was self-harm and he looked at me and said ‚ÄúSelf-harm?! Those are the people who cut. That‚Äôs not you.‚Äù And his expression almost made it seem like he found it humorous. I was caught off guard by his reaction and being so quick to assume that ‚Äúthats not me.‚Äù I almost told him about my ‚Äútendencies‚Äù in that moment but i almost started to cry and chose to keep it together instead which I‚Äôm not sure if i regret now. 

The second symptom he stopped on was thoughts of suicide and then he asked me if I have had any and I started crying which indirectly answered his question. These past two weeks I have been struggling with terrible anxiety and isolation and he said he thinks that these thoughts have stemmed off of that, but in reality I have been struggling with suicidal ideations for years. Im just not sure if I should tell him.

I feel like I can no longer bring it up or talk to him about this topic anymore because he made up his mind so quickly that I don‚Äôt fit the criteria so in his mind its case closed. I‚Äôve tried talking to him about my social isolation as well a few years ago because I found creating and maintaining relationships to be an extreme sport. Even just talking to people felt incredibly unnatural but his response was that I ‚Äúhad never seen real anxiety.‚Äú 

I‚Äôm not sure if I should try bringing it up to him again or if I should just wait to talk to my doctor about it since I have an appointment coming up in a few days but I‚Äôm really not sure I wanna be bawling my eyes out to my doctor about this. 

How should I approach this?"	Long_Choice_9834	post	30.67800748426849	female	White	0.9989913105964661	na	na	na	2	BlackMentalHealth
"Miss Long Choice you make a great step today even posting this. Yes it's unfortunate how our parents write things off or downplay mental health issues. I admire this generation that seek healing or no longer repressing the dark feelings inside. Sis you should speak to your therapist. If you want to cry let it out. I'm a grown man and didn't have the awareness or wisdom on how to approach my social awkwardness as a teenager. 

I cry as a grown man sometimes but it's about the process of healing and shedding the part of you who needs love, understanding and compassion. Last year at 44 I began a new journey to heal. I have a daughter and she's not in an ideal situation with her mother and grandmother. My healing isn't just for me but for her as well. Speak to your therapist. I hope she gives you the space to express yourself with compassion and no judgement.  

You have my support. It's great that you're addressing this now while you're still young. You have my encouragement. Come back here after your session and let me know how things go.

Oh ok lol. Yes your doctor could help. I do self therapy but there's a site called Better Help and through this network you can choose your own therapist. If you feel more comfortable talking to someone who looks like you there's a possibility you'll find her. I'm bisexual and I found a queer black female therapist.  I'm old enough to be your Father but I can relate to his reaction to your condition. As a Man and  Father I can't relate to the female experience but observing from my point of view black women  are disrespected and unheard entirely too much. That has changed and I'm grateful for that as a bisexual man who didn't truly love himself until my 40's.   You had the awareness that something is wrong within and did something about it.

But one of them is a struggle with decision making - we need something extra to generate enough of a emotional response to something in other to desire it. Your friends saying it's good might be giving supplemental emotional weight (i.e. dopamine) to the decision making it easier for you.

"all my life, i‚Äôve been nothing but mediocre. i was never invested in any sports or hobbies, i‚Äôve just been aimlessly floating through life with no purpose or sense of direction. i did online school for the remainder of my middle school years and all of my high school years (worst mistake) so i never got the chance to grow or develop new interests, build relationships, etc. because i was too busy dealing with my deteriorating mental health and focusing on trying to catch up on school work that i was perpetually behind on. 

not only was i behind on school work but i feel like online school stunted my overall growth, i‚Äôm not good at being social, i‚Äôve only had one irl friend for the past 7 years, i recently turned 20 and have absolutely nothing to show for it, i can‚Äôt do shit for myself because i‚Äôm so dependent on my parents, like i never properly learned to drive. and because i was so behind on online school, i didn‚Äôt graduate on time so i never went to college, im only just now going (this fall) so that i can keep certain benefits, not because i have a desire to. feels like everybody my age is in college making something of themselves while all i do is sit around at home waiting for my next shift.

"We are all on a different life path. 

As far as school/college/uni, I had many interests, but no money to pursue them. Also, I moved before my senior year in high school away from all my friends and family, so any plans I had was immediately scrapped. Eventually, I went to community college and took as many classes as I could until could figure out a new plan and then transferred to a university. I recommend talking to your classmates and other people around you, see what there career goals and plans are. Are explore your interests this may help you make a decision for a career or steer your towards a job. 

Also, maybe you will find your tribe when continue on to college. I met one of my best friends in the whole world and gained another family. And it happened when I wasn‚Äôt looking. 

As far as hobbies, just start something small and not time or money consuming (drawing, listening to music, etc). If you like it and can do it with little stress or effort, start to challenge your self or look for special characteristics in it. If you don‚Äôt like it, move on. I recommend going to any local fairs in your city or college. 

As far as your deteriorating mental health, talk to your family too. Maybe they have something that they want to try. Or they may have the same struggles.

"You sound just like me when I was around your age. I didn‚Äôt know how to drive when I was in my early 20‚Äôs it wasn‚Äôt until I reached my mid 20‚Äôs, I had to be about 24 or 25 when I finally got my drivers license. I used to be ashamed of that fact. Looking back on that now, though I can proudly say that I worked HARD to obtain my license. It was through my hard work that I was able to do this. I too didn‚Äôt have any friend. The majority of my 20‚Äôs was wrought with so much pain and struggles. I was socially awkward, and I was VERY hard on myself. 

To cut a long story short I came to a realization eventually that life is here for us to EXPERIENCE. We weren‚Äôt meant to be production machines. If you really consider the fact that when you graduate from high school naturally you‚Äôre excited about the experiences that you‚Äôre going to have, albeit those thoughts may be bit naive when it comes to actual reality. Regardless of the fact though our innate desire is to experience things. 

So I say to you instead of worrying about the clock on the wall focus on the things you want to explore. Yeah you tried a few activities that didn‚Äôt captivate your attention. Okay, that just simply means you aren‚Äôt that interested in them. So keep trying out new things until you find something you‚Äôre passionate about. 

Also depression can play a big role in your motivation to do things. So I advise you to get help. Someone can help you traverse through the murky waters of depression. 

Above all I say be patient with your self. Give your self time to experience things and learn from those experiences. Be kind to your self there‚Äôs no need to rush.

I was in a similar boat at 20, 10 years ago. Here‚Äôs what I got for you. Reflect on your strengths and weaknesses, be intimately knowledgeable of these. Next, pick a few skills you would like to have in 10 years. Start today, and just take baby steps. Learn to love the effort you put in to challenging yourself ‚Äî and trusting yourself that with focus and reps, you can get better. Next, challenge yourself to lock in those lifelong friends. You‚Äôre at a point where you‚Äôre still probs close enough with some of your HS peers, but not far enough that they‚Äôve all settled down with families. Find your 1-4 people that want to experience life with you in it. These social connections are key. If that‚Äôs too hard, join some weekly gathering and be patient. Lastly, if you‚Äôre having trouble finding a career that truly motivates you, think about what you would like to accomplish in life, and find a job that gets you the SKILLS to achieve that goal. Don‚Äôt expect to start your career for another 7-10 years so use this time, while your brain is still growing, to lock in the education YOU need and want. In every job, make connections, have lunch with someone new each month. Finally, exercise, eat and sleep well. If you can wrap your head around the fact that you are a unique expression of the universe, you can take steps to have that expression shine as brightly as you can. Take care of your body, your friends, and your mind. Our world has rapidly accelerated, and everyone is still trying to figure it out.

"I unknowingly got a lot of social skills by volunteering. I started in HS and volunteered off and on when I had time. I didn't have a lot of time (or somewhere to live) during certain periods, but its been a constant. I like it because a. I get to meet people who care about stuff I care about b. I usually see/work with some of the same people, so I can choose to get to know them or just stick to shift-related convos c. I can try things I'm curious about without a huge commitment (ex. I was considering becoming an ASL interpreter and got to try it out to see what it felt like irl) d. I can learn skills e. I have 'a lane' or 'a role' as a volunteer, so it doesn't tend to become the same kind of grind as work where you're seeing those people day in day out and they're bored so they start asking a bunch of personal questions.

Just a thought. And for what its worth, I was told through my entire upbringing both literally by some and figuratively by circumstances that I didn't have a right to exist and would never 'amount' to anything. It wasn't the healthiest route, but in that I got frustrated and finally said 'fuck it if I'm going to be a stupid, ugly, waste of resources either way, I may as well be terrible at a lot of different things.' 

I don't really do anything expecting to do well, I don't know what that's like. What I will say is that I've gotten to do a lot of different stuff because I was the only person who said, 'I don't know how to do that, but I'm willing to give it a shot.' Now when I talk about shit I've experienced people will be like 'wow you're amazing' or 'you've accomplished so much' and I laugh and just clarify that the only reason I got to do the thing is because I literally just showed up and was ok with failing.

I second the sentiment that self-compassion is free. For me, a lot has changed since I prioritized treating myself the way I'd like to be treated. Constantly berating myself didn't help me reach my goals successfully and left me wrung out. Its not all sunshine and rainbows for sure, but it is nicer in my head. Also, social media is something that didn't help my mental health at all.

It may help to look up examples of famous good/smart black people and look up examples of very stupid white people.

I spent many years feeling guilt and shame - as if there were something fundamentally wrong with me - because I refuse to sweep my families abuse under the rug. My hope is that this sample from the overall piece will bring comfort to the folks who are working to prioritize their health, care for themselves, and break the cycle of intergenerational trauma.


>In a culture of domination where children have no civil rights, those who are powerful, adult males and females, can exert autocratic rule of children. All the medical facts show that children are violently abused daily in this society. Much of that abuse is life threatening. Many children die. Women perpetuate this violence as much as men if not more. A serious gap in feminist thinking and practice has been the refusal of the movement to confront head-on adult female violence against children. Emphasizing male domination makes it easy for women, including feminist thinkers, to ignore the ways women abuse children because we have all been socialized to embrace patriarchal thinking, to embrace an ethics of domination which says the powerful have the right to rule over the powerless and can use any means to subordinate them. In the hierarchies of white supremacist capitalist patriarchy, male domination of females is condoned, but so is adult domination of children. And no one really wants to call attention to mothers who abuse.



>Often I tell the story of being at a fancy dinner party where a woman is describing the way she disciplines her young son by pinching him hard, clamping down on his little flesh for as long as it takes to control him. And how everyone applauded her willingness to be a disciplinarian. I shared the awareness that her behavior was abusive, that she was potentially planting the seeds for this male child to grow up and be abusive to women. Significantly, I told the audience of listeners that if we had heard a man telling us how he just clamps down on a woman‚Äôs flesh, pinching her hard to control her behavior it would have been immediately acknowledged as abusive. Yet when a child is being hurt this form of negative domination is condoned. This is not an isolated incident ‚Äì much more severe violence against children is enacted daily by mothers and fathers.

>Indeed the crisis the children of this nation face is that patriarchal thinking clashing with feminist changes is making the family even more of a war zone than it was when male domination was the norm in every household. Feminist movement served as the catalyst, uncovering and revealing the grave extent to which male sexual abuse of children has been and is taking place in the patriarchal family. It started with grown women in feminist movement receiving therapeutic care acknowledging that they were abuse survivors and bringing this acknowledgment out of the private realm of therapy into public discourse. These revelations created the positive ethical and moral context for children to confront abuse taking place in the present. However, simply calling attention to male sexual abuse of children has not created the climate where masses of people understand that this abuse is linked to male domination, that it will end only when patriarchy is eliminated. Male sexual abuse of children happens more often and is reported more often than female abuse, but female sexual coercion of children must be seen as just as horrendous as male abuse. And feminist movement must critique women who abuse as harshly as we critique male abuse. Beyond the realm of sexual abuse, violence against children takes many forms; the most commonplace forms are acts of verbal and psychological abuse.

>Abusive shaming lays the foundation for other forms of abuse. Male children are often subjected to abuse when their behavior does not conform to sexist notions of masculinity. They are often shamed by sexist adults (particularly mothers) and other children. When male parental caregivers embody anti-sexist thought and behavior boys and girls have the opportunity to see feminism in action. When feminist thinkers and activists provide children with educational arenas where anti-sexist biases are not the standards used to judge behavior, boys and girls are able to develop healthy self-esteem.

"My mother did all sort of weird abusive things that I won't get into here. But, it turned into her abandoning me as a teenager. Literally leaving me to pay bills and feed myself. As an adult, she refuses to admit any wrongdoing and just buys me things with someone else's money to keep me in line. I still called her out and stopped talking to her. Easily one of the hardest things I've done in a while. The disgusting things she's said about me and my maternal family incessantly targets me for refusing to talk to her but it's better than living a life with my silence being bought and her refusal to acknowledge her own faults. I've even had some friends, that are no longer my friends, disagree with my decision telling me I'm not man because I abandoned my mother.

I'm also glad that people have healthy families. Everyone deserves one, but we're not broken because chose we moved on from our abusers instead of accommodating them. Thank you for this post."	Denholm_Chicken	reply	na	na	na	0.0020907041616737843	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
Recently me and my mom had a falling out, because I loaned her money and she never paid it back when she promised she would. I decided to sweep it under the rug and go see her. When I got on her front porch I could literally hear my mom saying some of the nastiest meanest things about me  to someone on the phone. Her nasty words pierced my heart so hard, I just turn around and walked back home crying. It‚Äôs been two weeks since that happened and I haven‚Äôt said a word to her. It‚Äôs been very hard for me to go no contact with my mom, because I have always been the bigger person and excused my mom‚Äôs behavior. I decided I can‚Äôt deal with my mom mental abuse  anymore. my dad told me she feels guilty but doesn‚Äôt know how to apologize. A simple ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù would be fine but I know she‚Äôs never going to apologize.

"It's always hard to know that someone you truly loved feels the exact opposite way about you, and it's 1000x worse when that person is your mom. You probably wonder how can she say those things about you as if you are not her daughter. I'm guessing that your relationship with your mom has been rocky for a while? 

Its totally reasonable for you to be sad. It's hard not knowing how to navigate a complicated relationship with your mom. You want her to see you as a good daughter, but at what expense? I think your decision to go no-contact was a good one to make because she can't expect you to always be willing to show up for her when she does not do the same. And I agree, it doesn't take much to simply say ""I'm sorry,"" if she truly felt guilty.

If you ever start to have doubts about your decision, try to imagine if the roles were reversed. If your mother had caught you saying the most vile things about her, how would she have responded? Also remind yourself that no one deserves to be in that kind of relationship even if she weren't your mother.

"I know this is a rant and you didn't ask for advice, but I'd like to offer something for your consideration.

What if you communicate to your mom what your new boundaries are regarding your relationship with her? Cutting people off without warning is a maladaptive coping strategy and directly related to your attachment style. 

If you continue to excuse her behavior without communicating that you find it hurtful and damaging you're denying your own needs. You can set boundaries and new standards for how you allow yourself to be treated but you'll need to have a conversation about it first. 

It sounds like you have better communication with your dad so maybe he can help facilitate the conversation or at least support you in setting boundaries.

I hope you find a path to peace with your mom, I know that can be a difficult relationship to navigate at times."	HopefulFrog_	reply	na	na	na	0.998715877532959	weak	no	strong	na	BlackMentalHealth

That sucks, its not difficult to apologize - especially after being dishonest about the 'loan' and then talking badly about you. Do you have a therapist? If not, someone who specializes in family systems might be able to help you work through this and decide how you want to move forward.

"I never understand this perspective, if somebody doesn't want to come to an event I'm hosting I don't want them to come and I'd want them to be honest so I don't keep inviting them, plan for them to be there while they're making up their mind only to cancel at the last minute. 

People like to think they're more important than they are. *If I don't ____ it will hurt their feelings/break their heart!*  Really? So you mean they'd rather have a person who doesn't want to go show up... What do they get out of that?

I realized after decades of forcing myself to go to things I was invited to (I was raised similarly, people invited you and are requesting your presence, etc.) only to realize that the people didn't really care whether I was there or not. I could go to an event, not talk to anybody but the host when I arrive and the moment I say I'm leaving - suddenly everybody wants to talk! 

>Oh NO, you're leaving!!! We didn't get a chance to talk yet, what's new? Fill me in on what you've been up to!

They want me to entertain them, tell them my business so they can speculate/judge, and would have gone the whole party w/out saying one word to me if I hadn't mentioned I was leaving within earshot. I've had this happen more times than I can count, so it makes it easy to turn down general invitations. 

Now, when somebody invites me to a party I don't want to attend I'll decline and ask them to let me know if they want to get together one on one. They rarely do, but this is a way to determine if people actually want to be friends or if they just want a crowd of people at their event. 


Your parents sound challenging - read up on boundaries and codepencency. Even if you leave their home, if you're raised in this environment it will take a lot of time to unpack the damage it can do to your worldview and the type of people you're drawn to. I'd hate for you to repeat the same patterns after you leave their home.

"I have a close relative who visits 4Ch@n and the likes, and when he shares screenshots from there I get a headache or side eyeing them/him sometimes. They use the f and r slur freely, even tagging it at the end of a word like a suffix. They also say things like ""terminal autism"", ""schizo post"", ""take your meds"", and ""my autistic brain.""

Now I got executive function disorder and sometimes it causes me problems while my loved one has ADHD. I also go up for my autistic homies so seeing this peeves me a lot. I'm queer too and been called the f slur and a sodomite a few times. That being said I'm not particularly thrilled to hear such language. I was wondering if maybe I'm a little sensitive or is this language just... weird, if not borderline offensive to use? There's no telling if the ppl who says these things are neurodivergent but chances are not every single one of them are.

That being said, I'm interested to hear whoever wants to answer this opinions'. I'm asking this place in particular bc the Black neurodivergents I know aren't a big fan of such language. However, I tend to stay in my circle so I want to hear about other's perspectives.

Btw I will set a boundary on that real soon w/my loved one, there's just no convincing him atp. He confuses community with echo chamber sometimes. He also isn't the type to have pride about who he is bc he thinks it's cringe. To add, he doesn't get offended at offensive language bc he ""doesn't care or see the point."" On top of being stubborn, he's always standing 10 toes down until further notice.

"I was officially diagnosed as a child but my mother refused medical treatment for me. Which as you well know hindered me substantially. Without getting into a whole sob story. I‚Äôll just give a brief summary of how her decision impacted me. 

I grew up isolated not having any well developed social skills. 
My family constantly criticized me because of my unusual behavior. 
I was lonely a lot as a kid/teen so books were my personal escape from reality, I also played video games and web surfed a lot but reading is what I spent most of my time doing. 
I grew into a young adult and suffered even more because I just did not fully understand social norms. I thought I was the problem so I threw myself into many ‚Äúself help‚Äù projects to improve my communication skills and attention to detail. That did help but I still could not for the life of me make friends. I tried desperately to appear normal but it just didn‚Äôt seem to work. 

I‚Äôm a female and even though we‚Äôre supposed to be much better at masking than our male counterparts‚Ä¶I was not. 

I‚Äôm now in my 30‚Äôs and I can say that I‚Äôm much better off than I was as a young adult. I still don‚Äôt really have friends but I‚Äôve learned to embrace who I am. I‚Äôm married and have a wonderful loving husband who accepts me and my quirkiness. 

If you have ADHD/Autism I‚Äôd like to hear your experience with it if you don‚Äôt mind sharing. There isn‚Äôt a lot of representation for us. So it‚Äôs comforting to know I‚Äôm not the only one who struggles with this.

"I don't have a diagnosis, nor have I claimed autism as part of my identity but there are a lot of things as a child and now as an adult that make sense if I use the frame of autism. My family thought there was something ""off"" about me, in a weird socially awkward way and my mom says she thinks she should've had me tested as a child (which surprised me because my parents don't really believe in conditions like autism and ADHD). I think since I did so well in school, they didn't bother looking into why I might be struggling with social interactions or have very particular, sometimes unexplainable aversions/preferences for different things. 

There's a lot of examples but one of the most ""Ohhh is that what that is?"" things is finding out about stimming. I've been picking out my hair since kindergarten; interestingly I don't have as much urge to do it when my hair is straightened. It's not like I hate my natural hair, I actually think I look cute but I'll find myself plucking it out. I know sometimes people do this as an anxious habit, which could definitely be possible in my case but I also do this when I'm not stressed. It just feels soothing somehow and I do it mindlessly.

That was a specific example but there are also examples like scripting, seeming apathetic/cold because I don't get expressive (in my day to day life), framing everything through movies/superhero stuff (I did this more when I was younger but I still catch myself doing it now), sticking to a routine even when it no longer makes as much sense/there's more convenient options, etc."	Redditerderrrr	reply	na	na	na	0.004744029138237238	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

I'll write up a proper reply when I'm not so tired (I'm moving) but I gave a talk to a college class last year on being a fem/NB Black person who wasn't diagnosed until later in life.

I have seriously been considering starting up a discord or something for older BW so we can have a space to just be, and support each other. Its not something I can do right now, and I'd want to have a videochat with people before adding them to make sure they're not just trolling but I suggested that idea to another group for BW and it was quickly shot down - this was after one of the members left because someone made a troubling comment (she didn't explain) so I'm not sure how to ensure a space is FUBU."

"Hi there! I have both ADHD and OCD (as well as other conditions), and let me tell you, getting diagnosed has meant learning lots of ways to *make my life easier.* 

Because I hadn't been diagnosed, there were a lot of things I didn't realize other people *didn't* experience, that *weren't* super difficult. Like...people were out there genuinely having an easier time than I was, and I was sitting there beating myself up for shit that wasn't even my fault, and telling myself to ""just try harder"" because...that's basically what I had been told my whole daggone life. 

But I was trying *10 times harder than everyone around me,* just to scrape by on some stuff!

Getting diagnosed with OCD led me to some medication that turned those horrible voices and images and panicked thoughts in my head that raised my blood pressure and attacked me out of nowhere and kept me from falling asleep, WAAAAAAAAYYYYYYY down. Suddenly that **""WHAT IF WHAT IF WHAT IF?!!?!?!?!""** channel went from full blast all day long to an occasional whisper.

Getting diagnosed with ADHD led me to strategies to work *with* my brain instead of trying to force it into a set of behaviors it's literally not structured to do. I've got different systems for tasks, that help me get shit done. I've got a different setup for my stuff that helps me not lose things so often. 

And I've got medication that helps me focus, and helps my mind stay more quiet and less scattered. I don't feel as much like I'm surrounded by a cloud of bees and static electricity all day. I can hold some amount of information in my head, and keep track of time, a little bit, and put things in sequence and follow through. It's not perfect. But it's *better.* And I'm finding more tools and strategies all the time to try and improve things, and I'm learning how to advocate for supports that will help others to make things easier for me, so I'm not the one doing all the work and *still* working 10 times as hard.

"You obviously haven't been doing fine for the last 13 years if you're experiencing suicidality and worrying/overthinking. A diagnosis isn't the end of the world, and being diagnosed might help you get support that you otherwise wouldn't be able to access.

Having a diagnosis of ADHD would help you in your education, as you could have an individual education plan put in place for you, which could help you better achieve your academic goals. In college it means you would be able to get reasonable accommodations like extra time for assignments, extra help for exams, and you could also apply for extra funds allocated for disabled students.

I think it would be a good idea to discuss the possibility that you may have ADHD and OCD with your therapist, instead of denying it, especially if denying it keeps you stuck and wondering why you're having these intense thoughts and feelings. Sometimes, with a diagnosis, it can help you make sense of the things you've always felt and thought. It's like the puzzle pieces finally falling into place, and it can help you move forward.

Maybe think about why you don't want to have these diagnoses. Is it because of what society thinks about disability? Have you internalised those negative messages? Do you think people with learning disorders are a certain way that you don't fit? Or that learning disabilities means you're not intelligent, or that there's something 'wrong' with you? Is the image of people with learning disabilities a stereotypical, negative one, that you've absorbed? Do you think people would treat you differently or negatively?

Your therapist can help you with questions like these, and it's probably best if you tell her your fears, so you and she can discuss them and the possibilities of what could happen if you were given a diagnosis. You can talk about both good and bad aspects, but pushing the topic away and not talking about it probably isn't going to be helpful to you, especially if you start worrying even more."	espider13qn	reply	na	na	na	0.006795600056648254	no	no	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

tw: abuse

Hey everyone. I have another main account, but I didn't feel comfortable posting this on their since it's known by my spouse and some friends. I'm a black woman and in my mid-twenties, and I'm married to a black man in his mid-late twenties. We met in college, and after being friends for a few years we started dating and got married.

My husband has anger issues. He's punched walls in frustration. He's broken our gaming chair. He still routinely will go out for walks in the middle of the night in frustration, usually after an argument we've had. He's doing that as I type this. Today, he was upset because the person who owns our apartments said we couldn't hang up something our balcony. As he was leaving, he grabbed something to eat with a spoon on the the road. I told him that I didn't think it was a super good idea to eat and drive at the same time, especially with a spoon.

He said ""F\*ck you,"" and left.

He called me later to apologize, but said that it felt infantilizing for me to say that. Later on, he came back in a bad mood due to micromanaging at his work. But he developed new gripes about me, and he spent the day talking about this. He was deeply bothered by the fact that I told him not to eat like that on the road. He mentioned that he sent a message to our apartment's general manager, and I asked what he sent because admittedly, I was a bit concerned. My husband was upset and felt that I didn't trust him, and when I pointed out that he has broken things in our house out of anger, he asked me to not bring up old things he's trying to work on.

Later, when we made up a little bit, he spent some time talking about some things he's going through mental health wise, and how he never felt comfortable around black women due to his mother and the teasing he received in school. At some point, he mentioned he would love to go back to group counseling for black men. So I leaned over and tried looking for some resources for him.

He didn't like that. He told me it felt like I wasn't listening, and fact that my body language often doesn't make him feel listened to.

I told him that I genuinely believe he doesn't see me, but he instead sees every black women whose disappointed him in the past. He agreed.

And he's now walking around our neighborhood in the middle of the night. And I'm typing this, in tears.

I just wanted to vent this to someone. My mom is dead. My family is toxic. His family is actually very aware of his anger/mental health issues (it unfortunately runs in the family) and has made it clear that they don't mind me sharing these concerns with them, but I don't to make the situation worse by calling his parents and having them call him while he's walking around. I have spent the last few years wondering if my husband has BPD or another disorder.

I'm just so tired. I love him deeply, but these moments happen where his brain interprets almost everything I say as a personal insult to him. When he's doing okay, he is the sweetest, most empathetic person in the world. But in these moments, he feels like the world is against him, and me especially.

"He seems somewhat like me if I didn't realize what was happening to me. All of these issues perpetuated itself in my psyche until I figured out.

Nothing I did felt natural or normal to me. All the things that people wanted me to chase I hated to my core. There hadn't been a safe place I could be since the day I was born. PTSD from my family among other issues that went unnoticed during my childhood. 

The only fix was deconstructing it all and living a life that truly made me happy. All these issues you're describing might be a symptom of living a life that feels deeply wrong and unnatural to him. The only fix is probably, living a life that you're proud of and accepting yourself, but the person that comes out of that process might look drastically different from your husband.

"I would suggest you go to therapy by yourself. You're dealing with a lot of abuse and that tends to make victims lose themselves because they want to be able to help or fix their partners. You need tools on not only how to navigate his behavior but also set boundaries for your own well being.

The truth is that changing behaviors is hard for most people. They not only need to be willing to do the work, they also need to be able to acknowledge the harm it's caused. And for some, that's a difficult thing to process and it takes years to unlearn their behavior. For others, it may never change.

[Please get help.](https://www.thehotline.org/identify-abuse/domestic-abuse-warning-signs/) This is one of those situations where you may love him, but you are going to have to love yourself more. It will only get worse, and talking to his family will not change him - they may be enabling him out of fear for his safety - which is understandable considering the circumstances but if his untreated symptoms are getting worse he will become more of a threat to you and himself over time. 

For whatever reason, hes unable to do what he needs to do in order to get to where he needs to be. The saying goes you have to put your oxygen mask on before you can help anyone else, and I'm also reminded of the saying don't light yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. 

This has the potential to impact you, any potential children (please, please, please stay on top of your bc as reproductive coercion is a favorite of people who are in denial) as well as your finances, future living arrangements, etc. 

>when I pointed out that he has broken things in our house out of anger, he asked me to not bring up old things he's trying to work on.

This was a tactic that was used on me constantly by an abusive family member for years. I didn't realize it was abuse in my case because they were younger, female, also being abused by parents, etc. 

I strongly encourage you to seek your own therapy as the other poster said, in my case trying to speak about the abuse during the 'honeymoon phase' and constantly being told 'why you bringing up old shit' then having my whole family look at me like I was the problem and then enable the ongoing abuse as a way not to 'air dirty laundry'.... it really did a number on my worldview, communication styles, boundaries, and self-esteem. Its a form of gaslighting and in my life, a huge red flag. 

People who don't want to look at the past tend to refuse to do so because they know it was wrong and instead of taking accountability and making *true* amends (saying I'm sorry with some tears thrown in for good measure is not making amends, asking the person 'what do you want me to do so we can forget about this' instead of figuring it out, etc.) they want to just pretend it didn't happen. If they had to acknowledge their choice, they might have to admit there is an issue and--in my experience--a lot of folks don't want to do that work. Some of them aren't in the space where they can, but in that case its not fair to the people who care for/support them to deal with the constant fallout. In the case with children, etc. it can lead to lifelong challenges."	pleaseplzjustlisten	reply	na	na	na	0.9869109392166138	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
"It's Mental Health Awareness Month ü•≥ü•≥

This month, we're focusing on a group that often gets overlooked when it comes to mental health support: MEN! Specifically our Caribbean Men

Ladies, as we celebrate and prepare ourselves for the soft life we deserve, let's not forget about the mental health of the men in our community, that we EXPECT üëÄ to provide us with that soft life. 

This month, my blog is focusing on ways we can support the men who have been the backbone of our society. Ladies, let's show our appreciation for the men in our lives by learning more about their mental health. And Kings, know that you're not alone in this journey

"Rant incoming:

>Encouraging Caribbean men to open up may take time and patience, but the payoff is HUGE. Like some other things, they have (wink wink ‚Äì let me behave).
> So let‚Äôs challenge those traditional gender roles and break down those emotional walls together!""

This line isn't cool. At all. It's amazing that you peddle an ignorant trope about black men and then immediately talk about challenging traditional gender roles. I guess gender roles are only bad when men don't wanna talk about emotions but they're fine in terms of expecting every man to have a hammer. Should I write an article about Caribbean women and talk about how we all love their fat asses? No, I shouldn't and I wouldn't, because not only is that extremely dehumanizing, it's also not at all related to the mental health aspect.

Since you're coming at this from the angle of women who are interested in Caribbean men, let me share my POV as a first generation Jamerican.

Women want a man who is both charming and emotionally available. That is totally reasonable. My issue is that so many of you find yourselves settling with men who are definitely the first and not the second. There are plenty of men out there like myself who do not have the stereotypical Jamaican charm that's rooted in being a misogynistic player, but we have put in the work to unlearn our upbringings and exist in a way that's emotionally vulnerable and available. And those niggas are not in relationships or hook up situations at the same rate as the first group. You can all say you want emotional vulnerability and I'm sure you do, but it also seems that if you have to choose one, you'll choose charm over emotional intelligence. And your comment about the big dicks only proves that to me. Emotional intelligence isn't even second in your priority list, it's third at best, right behind having a silver tongue and a big pole.

I had all those biases in mind when I read the headline but decided I was going to put those to the side at least until I finished your article. Because I do genuinely appreciate you trying to look at the reasons for men being so sheltered emotionally. You seem to be coming from a place of compassion and understanding, but the allusion to big dicks really isn't cool at all. Just reinforces the notion in my bitter, black, incel brain that women, of any color, do not genuinely give a fuck about the mental health of black men. Maybe in addition to an article about Caribbean boys being taught to not show emotion (apart from anger and rage), you should write another about Caribbean women claiming they want a progressive man, when in actuality they want what's comfortable and what they've grown up around, which is manipulative misogynists

"I‚Äôve had good and bad experiences with white and black therapists. 

At base it‚Äôs all about compatibility, professionalism on their part, compliance and being an active member in session on the patient‚Äôs part. 

I‚Äôve termed with a black therapist who couldn‚Äôt keep it together and was too ‚Äúcasual‚Äù and dismissive when I would discuss certain issues. 

I‚Äôve termed a white therapist who had a meltdown when I had to cancel the day of the session. She told me I NEEDED to be there, I told her something came up that I really couldn‚Äôt move around, she in turn threatened to call the cops and file a Mental Illness Warrant on me (mind you I‚Äôve NEVER given anyone a reason to do that). 

That didn‚Äôt give me much of a choice. 

So I went and watched her bawl and express how ‚Äúremorseful‚Äù she was about how black people were being treated (at the height of the BLM movement), how her father was racist but she never was, how she wishes all black people were treated like white people, etc. (FIRED.)

I recently termed a Latina therapist who attempted to do a session of Internal Family Systems with me, only to find out she was ‚Äúpracticing‚Äù on me as it was her first time after taking an online class. 

Mind you, I‚Äôve worked with and had therapists of all kinds who were great. 

Oddballs, unnecessary risk takers, and chronic counter-transference-ers are everywhere. 

I will say that it‚Äôs always easier to talk about race relations with a Black therapist. You don‚Äôt have to explain NEARLY as much or correct NEARLY as many preconceived notions like you do with others. 

But all in all, you can get some VERY good therapy from a white therapists who is dedicated, seasoned, does their continuing education/research, and really knows their stuff."	Mopincuzimbroken	reply	na	na	na	0.9965543746948242	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
"I've only ever had white therapists. Most of them have been pretty great. My current therapist is *AMAZING.* I cannot overstate how great she is. I've been with her for...six? Seven? Years, she's moved practices three times, and I've followed her every time, if that says anything. I would get in a rocket ship and follow her to the daggone MOON. 

We vibe really well. I *trust* her, on a whole lotta levels. I know she has my best interest at heart. We're honest with each other, it's a two-way street. She laid out some expectations that *I should have for her,* at the beginning, and invited me to add to that, and it created an air of safety. I've called her on a couple things, over the years, and she moved to course correct immediately, and that showed me she was serious, and I could trust her. And she gently and constructively calls me on my bullshit, when I'm on my bullshit, and we work together to figure out how to get me back on my good sense. 

And she's good at her profession, and she's real about applying it. She will tell me, ""I know some things that will help deal with this long-term, and we can dig into working on those. They are intensive, and a lot of work, and they can bring up some difficult stuff, though, and with what's going on in the immediate, it's not safe to go there right now. We gotta address this immediate stuff, and when that's in a better place to give you a safer foundation, we can do the hard work. Your safety is the most important thing. You're important! You need you!""

And when I had a bad episode because my medication got screwed up, I was terrified of the idea of having to be hospitalized, but shit was falling apart, and I knew I didn't have the capacity to keep going, or to be making decisions about what to do next. But I knew *she* did. So I sent up a distress signal, and she got me on for an emergency session, and told me about partial-hospitalization programs (PHPs), and gave me a concise list of steps to take over the next day or two, to start the process of applying for leave and short-term disability at work, and connecting the PHP program with my HR office. 

And she told me I could do this, and validated how terrible it was that this was happening, and reminded me of all the skills I have, and pointed out how I'd done all the right things, and how much hope that gave her for my success and recovery from this setback, and encouraged me to continue to use those same behaviors, of reaching out to my network of support and working a safety plan, and that she'd see me again soon. 

She's just...practical, and skilled, and encouraging, and personable, and supportive. And funny as fuck, and cool as hell. We have a wink-wink-nudge-nudge joke that when I'm ""cured,"" we're going to a concert together, as an ""incentive"" for both of us to really give it our all in working on improving my mental health. üòÇ"	Mopincuzimbroken	reply	na	na	na	0.9965543746948242	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"Honestly being in and out of therapy myself, currently out and substituting with reddit lul, I gotta say it really doesn't matter tbh I mean it does because as far as black trauma goes you might get a therapist who can understand but not every black person has had severe trauma or cares to relate 

Just know that even the black therapists have potential to be disappoint the fuck out of you with their lack of empathy and just overall dismissal of mental health and trauma. 

Last black therapist told me that if she doesn't write it down it never happened, she had this complete air of not giving a fuck and I stopped seeing her because she wasn't giving me effective advice and on top of that just kept regurgitating the same thing and had me talking about work and was making me do the work alone. 

The last white 1 on 1 therapist I had was when I was a senior in HS and she didn't give a fuck about me at all and was crying about her own shit during my sessions lmao 

Last GROUP white therapist I had was amazing and kind, fucking love you Kathy and then I had moved on to one on one with this white man and he was a former addict himself and he was very kind and actually very effective but I ended up relapsing soo yeah 


I'd say just feel the therapist out black or white, man or woman, try to gage the way they view you and take you seriously, some therapists are not good at hiding their lack of fucks so it makes it easier and watch out for superficial ones too the ones that go ""mhm mhm mhm uh huh uh huh right right right I see I see mhm mhm mhm hmmmm mmmmm right I see ok mhm mhm"" they act like they're listening but they don't HEAR you 

Definitely not advocating for white therapists only but sometimes they surprise you lol sometimes we have to take off that racialized lens and just hope that by viewing that person as a person they can do the same for us especially in the mental health field it's hard asf the industry preys on people's empathy and honestly there's not a lot of that going around

"I've only had white therapists except one support group for Black women, but that was only for a few months. 

I've tried therapists (and will leave if its not a good fit) over the years and while some of them were nice I didn't feel comfortable bringing my whole self to the session. The therapist I have now I've had for over a decade and I love her I'm about to move again, so I think it may be time to find another one. Its hard to find someone who I can let hear all of the things I've been through and still feel like I can be vulnerable. My current therapist is also older/radicalized and therapy isn't her first career, so we're able to relate in a lot of ways I haven't been able to with other therapists. She will just call bullshit on folks trying to pull some nonsense and I need it clear and direct like that. She also has Black folks in her heart, not tokens but in-laws, etc. that she's tight with and those relationships preceded our working relationship. I know now that if I do wind up interviewing another white therapist I will be asking them point-blank if there are Black folks in their life. I've been around the sun enough times to know what a self-labeled ally whose only taken classes on 'working with minorities' looks like. 

One barrier to finding a Black therapist I continue to see is people putting their religious beliefs into their practice. While that is their right, I have a LOT of religious trauma and religion has *no* place in healthcare (or education, or the workplace, or politics... etc.) as access to healthcare *should* be a basic human right. I don't care what a therapist believes/does on their own time, but if they're putting that on their profile they are going to bring it into the session (either consciously or subconsciously) and as a result are not a good fit for **me.**"	Mopincuzimbroken	reply	na	na	na	0.9965543746948242	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

I‚Äôve had a few friends mention that they‚Äôre concerned, and that I feel distant to them. The point was to create distance. Their concern makes me uncomfortable and I‚Äôd rather not deal with it. I don‚Äôt mean to sound harsh. I can barely feel my own feelings right now, I don‚Äôt want to feel theirs. I don‚Äôt want anyone around me. I‚Äôve started cutting people off. This is probably compounded by the fact that I didn‚Äôt really expect to live past 25, I‚Äôll be 28 this weekend but I‚Äôm not acknowledging it. I have no thoughts to do anything- I plan on continuing to live. I have a career to look forward to, and it‚Äôs the only thing I can be excited about. I‚Äôm in therapy to deal with the breakup. I think it‚Äôs going well. I‚Äôm more irritable than usual, I‚Äôm kind of leaning into the bitchiness. I have less tolerance for most things. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong. I‚Äôm functioning pretty normally, as far as day to day stuff. If you read this, thank you."	srae22	post	20.580138658333382	male	White	0.9904950857162476	na	na	na	1	BlackMentalHealth
"What you're experiencing, the irritability, isolation, distancing, less patience, etc. doesn't sound off to me. I see it as taking the time/space that you need to process the breakup and to be honest, I know a lot of people who would benefit from that approach.

My experience has been that a lot of people are uncomfortable with what is deemed as 'negative' emotions and that's why a lot of people jump from relationship to relationship, job to job, stay buying stuff they can't afford, etc. with no time to reflect. I also recognize that some people's processes are different and to them I say - good for you, but that's not me. It takes a lot for me to trust someone with my heart and if its broken, I'm going to take a long time to work though it. My timeline for working through heartbreak isn't going to look like somebody else's and that's ok. 

It can be difficult to convince other people of that though, even if they're well-meaning friends, but that's on them. It is not their job to manage my emotions, nor is it mine to manage theirs. What I need from them while I'm managing my feelings is that they manager theirs and trust that I'm working to get where I need to be in  my own time, and in my own way. 

I also get frustrated with toxic positivity, all emotions have a purpose - even checking out has a purpose as long as it doesn't go too far into an unhealthy amount--that is for you/your therapist to determine--and I'd like to see a world where we can talk about how we're actually feeling without causing alarm.

I got a really good book (its kind of dated, but the sentiments are great) called Mending Broken Hearts by Adele Wilcox, I got it at the thrift store for 2.00 and the chapters are broken into various emotional states. Each section which is usually only a page or two, has a brief anecdote and a daily meditation on each one. I've found it helpful as I'm doing a lot of heart-centered work around family issues. I didn't even realize how much I struggled to just feel and how quickly I'd start shaming myself for feeling angry, sad, hopeless, etc. and that lead to me shutting down and feeling nothing. It was a viscous cycle. 

Anyway, enough about me. I just wanted to chime in and normalize what you're going through. Just the fact that you're talking about it and processing are good things in my humble opinion - I wasn't able to begin therapy in earnest until 30 so go you!"	srae22	reply	na	na	na	0.9904950857162476	weak	no	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"Why do these demented specimens only keep repeating the same thing  that you're supposed to just keep going indefinitely?

There is no joy in life, there never has been. No memories no nothing. No dates, no experiences, no anything. Just constant disrespect, constant violations and endless expectations.

Since I got cut out of that bitch's stomach nobody gave a mere inkling of a fuck about me. Every damned day and night for 29 years I've been alone ""doing the right thing"" and ""improving myself"".

There is no reward. These foul little bastards keep asking me to ""teach"" and ""mentor"" but what these pieces of shit don't understand is that doing the right thing means absolutely nothing. 

You will still be agonizingly lonely. Nobody is going to suddenly be like ""oh wow I want to hang out with him!!"" No woman is going to be like ""oh gee whiz I want him to fuck me!!

I have always wanted to die and that remains unchanged. If I were the killing type I would have about 20 mangled and burned corpses for all the violations I have suffered in this ""self improvement"".

I hate this hellhole planet and I hate every goddamned human living on it.

I lost my mother several years ago..but in secret it still feels like yesterday, sometimes.

I understand how you might be feeling. But - do NOT give in to the depression and suicide thoughts.

The commenter who opined that you should talk to your mom just as though she was there - is absolutely correct. I also highly suggest you get a journal - no need to be fancy - or if you want to get particularly fancy with the journal so be it - begin by writing about how YOU feel, and in between the tears, write about ALL the wonderful advice your mom gave you, and especially touch on how your mother would NOT in any way want you to harm yourself.

If your mom loved plants for example, at the grocery store next time you go, buy a small plant that you can take care of and admire.

I'm sorry you're struggling, i'd maybe look for a grief support group or therapist that specializes in grief (look up different types of therapy). 

My dad died seven years ago and I just realized that the day passed last week and I didn't notice. I feel his presence when I do things we did together like sing or smoke weed. Or when I think about something he told me I feel his presence strongly. You could also try making friends with an older person(naturally, not forced) or speaking with family members who also miss her or who remind you of her.

Have you thought about building an altar for her /and other ancestors that are supporting you from the other side? Each day it can remind you that you stand on her shoulders and she lives on in you. 
I've been wanting to do an altar for my Pa, especially for the day off the dead holiday.

Even though I don't know you I want you to be able to cope as best as you can. You deserve to be happy and I'm sure it would pain your family greatly to lose you. 

Thank you for trusting strangers with your feelings and thoughts. That's extremely brave of you to reach out for help in whatever way you know how. If you haven't thought of talking to a professional then please I beg of you to do so. I don't know if you fear going to a hospital by force because you decided to talk to a professional. But I hope I can reassure you that it's not the end goal all the time. Sometimes they just want to help you develop better coping skills. Honestly I can't tell you what to do because I'm not a professional and can only go by the times I've felt suicidal(very often) and reached out to people other than my family. But this is about you and while I can't imagine what you're going through or even understand what you're feeling I do hope you know that you're beautiful amazing and you deserve to be here.

Maybe try to stay away from negative things like the news and to limit social media while you're grieving as all the negativity has a potential to make grieving worse.

 Also you are absolutely not an idiot. Grieving periods are different for everyone so grieve however long you see fit. But the best thing I can offer is a listening ear and the advice to do whatever it takes to make sure you don't make a permanent decision while not thinking clearly because of grief.

"Hi there. I'm not a therapist or anything, but it sounds like maybe the root of what your mind *wants* to focus on is the *comfort* aspect, and the traumatic scenario is a way to get to that place. 

Like others have said, this may be a feature of OCD, like intrusive thoughts, and therapy is a great idea to sort it out and *try to gain some understanding*, especially since it's causing you stress and distress. 

From another perspective, the idea of being comforted after being ill or being hurt appealing to folks is pretty common, as a human experience. The idea of being cared for, being nurtured, being nourished...we are social creatures who basically evolved to exist in communal groups. That's what we're supposed to do. 

It's not strange that you want comfort. Maybe there's a way to get to those thoughts, but dial back the things you imagine to get to that place. And therapy can probably help.

"If you dig into my history, you'll see this isn't my first rodeo with this situation (that should've been handled before now). I'll do my best to be concise.

Basically, my (40m) brother (33m), who lives with our parents, is going through what's almost certainly some kind of episode. He's extremely paranoid, irritable, sometimes aggressive (though not violent), and isolates himself.

For a little bit of context, our parents have a restaurant, where he works. When he's ""himself,"" he's generally very soft-spoken, approachable, funny, and good-natured. During his episodes, however, when he's not holing up in one of the back offices, nearly all day, door closed, in the dark; he's snapping at co-workers and avoiding work (unless my Dad is working there that day and makes him do work), until one of our parents either makes him leave or, lately, he just gets up and leaves himself.

He's convinced that everyone is plotting against him, or otherwise just hostile to him, including family (I seem to be more or less exempt from this), and everything is a sign or proof of this. The only reason he works at the restaurant, now, is to make money to pay child support for his daughter. 

He also says he's been working on some internet marketing project that will make him plenty of money to finally move out, take care of his daughter, and move away. He'll buy tons of books on business and such, and has researched plenty on programming and such, but there's no evidence he's made any progress on such project, and he won't reveal details of it for fear someone will try to undermine it. (He'll also reject any assistance to bring this project to fruition--he insists he must do it all alone).

While he's not threatened to hurt anyone else or himself, his behavior gets intense enough to where sometimes our mom (who he's especially hostile to during these periods) gets nervous about him being in the house.

I made a similar post two years ago about his situation, link here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/askatherapist/comments/mv1tps/how\_to\_help\_my\_paranoid\_brother/](https://www.reddit.com/r/askatherapist/comments/mv1tps/how_to_help_my_paranoid_brother/).

 The fallout from there is we ended up contacting a mobile crisis center who sent people to the house to talk him down, and--once they could get a word in edgewise--basically told him that his behavior could lead to him getting locked up or worse. A week or so after that, he cooled down, and then he gradually became ""himself again.""

I *know* we should've tried to get him some help when he was ""himself"" again, when he'll be more likely to be receptive to help. It seems like all we can do now is ride this latest episode out until then--because he is adamant that he not only doesn't need any kind of psychiatric help whatsoever, but that he ""knows psychology"" enough to where he could outsmart any specialist. He's also not stupid, so he's aware of a pattern of ""he flips out, family members try to talk him down, there's an attempt to get him evaluated, etc.""

I also know that until he demonstrates being a threat to himself or others, we can't forcibly commit him (which would be traumatic in itself).

I guess I'm basically asking for any advice to handle this situation--including, but not limited to, any tips for how to get a paranoid person (I figured he has some kind of undiagnosed bipolar, borderline or other paranoid disorder; but obviously, I don't know for sure) to consent to an evaluation, at least.

TL;DR - Brother's going through a paranoid period; could use advice on how to either ride it out until he's ""normal,"" when he'll likely be more willing to go get help; or, perhaps, convince him in spite of this state to get evaluated or committed now.

"Whoof. My heart goes out to you both. 

I manage bipolar 1 (among other things) myself. And while paranoia is not a feature I've struggled with, anger is how my manic stages usually manifest. That ""wolf in the cave"" behavior is absolutely me, when the dark red mania hits. 

Granted, I get that glittery yellow stuff too, maybe 35% of the instances. But yeah. Most of the time, if I get hypomanic or manic, I feel overstimulated to the max. Turn on a light in the room, and the brightness level activates my ""fight/flight/fawn/freeze"" button, and it's like a baseball bat slammed my ""fight"" response. Just wake up wanting to throw hands at the fucking sun. Want to take a full bite out of a manhole cover if my shirt is itchy. 

Isolating in a dark, quiet, comfortable space is one of the ways I can actually manage my symptoms until I come back to balance. And I say that just for a piece of perspective. I think you get that, from the outside; you're observing those behaviors and picking up on that. 

It took a lot to get me to get evaluated. I came to a place where I was *scared,* and *exhausted,* and just *sick of feeling like shit.* And honestly...I was feeling shitty enough to start talking to my friends about the bad thoughts I was having about things I might do to myself. So they very kindly marched me down to the counseling center at our university and sat with me while I made an appointment. 

Part of it was them framing it as not a judgment; not like, there's something wrong with you, or this is an emergency (even though it was). But just, ""Hey. Friend? You're suffering way too much. That's not cool. You can't keep on like this, you deserve some help, and we're gonna help you get it. We're gonna walk with you, we're gonna hold your hand, we're gonna sit with you, and we're gonna be with you after. And you're gonna keep walking on your own next time, but we're doing this, right now, because we love you.""

They were really calm about saying, ""Yep. That's enough. That's the limit, right there."" It was really scary, but it also kinda felt like a relief. And it set me on a good path that eventually got me stable. 

And like...realistically, it takes time. The first professional might not be the right fit; the first few rounds of meds might not be good. And that's something to be prepared for. But that's down the road a ways.

I don't know if hearing from other folks who have been through similar experiences to his, or getting some kind of support from folks who know what it's like, could help? Sometimes it's tough to hear advice or recommendations from people who don't know intimately what it *feels* like. And I don't know if that's something you have local access to. 

I dunno. That's just my experience and perspective, and I hope it's helpful in some way. Wishing you all some peace, friend."	SinikalSaint	reply	na	na	na	0.9962180256843567	strong	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

It is a slow trauma, you ‚Äúalmost‚Äù begin to believe what economic and social parameters you don‚Äôt belong in are there for a reason.  It is absolutely difficult to even begin and a kind of where to start.   Racist teachers, teachers who do see you but do not know how to help, the ability for tasks to be completed and to hear adhd is not a crutch.  To be intelligent and it being a threat to co workers bosses and others.  To be fully aware of the people surrounding you and that you are knowing not only racism is there but that you are simultaneously having to observe yourself and them in those surroundings.

"Black. Part Native. Autistic with severe synesthesia and social issues. 

1.  It was difficult. Not the Black or Native part until I became older. The autistic aspects prevented me from forming bonds, until I knew what it was. So, I have very few actual friends from childhood. Not until after college when I learned about autism and was diagnosed did I understand my behaviors. I altered them with lots of help and failures along the way. 

2.  It was amazing. Because without it I wouldn‚Äôt be who I am, with the woman I am and the kids I have. In the work I have.

"Looking back, it was unnecessarily harsh. Not entirely sure I would change anything though as crazy as that sounds!

I was called absent minded, lacking in common sense, smart but dumb, and ‚Äúantisocial‚Äù which was used improperly maybe?

Trouble connecting with others, thinking the world wasn‚Äôt a real place because of how wacky and backwards things seemed to be, lots of hopelessness around others but very content by myself with my books.üòä

I had a few more variables than others in that I just found out my ‚Äúdad‚Äù isn‚Äôt, and my bio father who I only spoke to once (he was NOT happy about that) [also, I came across this information at age 34] is VERY much on the spectrum as well as my half sister (his other kid.)

So growing up in an environment and family where education was shunned and people were very sensitive to the success of others was difficult to say the least. My bio family? Everyone is brilliant. Everything I ever did finally makes sense. 

Ultimately, I love that it‚Äôs second nature for me to pave my own way.

"**How I went from being hospitalized twice and being on suicide watch to being happy and successful in my life, having control of my emotions, not letting my thoughts control me, coaching, consulting and more:**

*YOU SEE IN 2013‚Ä¶..*

‚Ä¢ I had a random surgery and afterwards my entire life changed for the worse

‚Ä¢ I had multiple freak physical ailments that prevented me from contributing to society that no doctor could figure out

‚Ä¢ I was at a new doctor every few days with no answers and quickly fell into a deep dark depression

‚Ä¢ I was hospitalized a few months after my surgery, put on suicide watch and I still couldn‚Äôt cope or figure out how I would make it to the next day

‚Ä¢ I couldn‚Äôt sleep, talk, eat or do any of the normal everyday things humans do‚Ä¶ I thought my life was truly over

Well, after being hospitalized a second time in 2016, I knew something had to be different, so I focused on just a few VERY simple principles and everything since then has changed:

1.) I learned simple tactics to help calm my anxiety attacks and to prevent overthinking which led be down a rabbit hole

2.) I got educated on medication and different forms of therapy

3.) I got educated on healthy vs harmful relationships between me, myself and I as well as with others in my inner circle

4.) I learned a variety of different lifestyle habits that helped stabilize my mood

Starting in January 2017, I was not having suicidal thoughts, I was able to wake up every day and accomplish things I couldn‚Äôt before, not having to worry about not sleeping, eating or functioning at a high level, lost 50 pounds, got a job at my college‚Äôs newspaper, coached and educated others on my story among many other things‚Ä¶. and if I can do it, ANYONE CAN!!!

I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre 18 and feel like todays going to be the last day of your life, OR if you‚Äôre 70 and haven‚Äôt been able to accomplish life goals you might want to still achieve and still can‚Äôt get out of the everyday rut where there‚Äôs no light at the end of the tunnel‚Ä¶.

Stay the course and keep pushing forward. Keep learning ‚Äì keep your discipline ‚Äì and keep taking scary amounts of action.

You‚Äôre already there ‚Äì time just hasn‚Äôt caught up yet!

"I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre feeling this way and that you haven‚Äôt been able to get the right support for you! Unaliving isn‚Äôt a great answer for anything. I get the appeal as well, if someone does it, that unsettledness inside of them is gone and the stress and the worry that continues to build in a society that thrives off of sickness and pain, it would be done with. 

So would anything you enjoy, love and care for though too. The pain you feel would be passed onto others and it doesn‚Äôt truly ever end really. I don‚Äôt know how hard depression is hitting you but, I assure you that you deserve to feel good things and enjoy things in life and to feel settled inside yourself. If that feels impossible right now, I am so sorry that you feel under attack by your brain and/or by your life experience. I don‚Äôt even want to say ‚Äúit gets better‚Äù because I know that‚Äôs tired. It takes a lot of work and effort for people to get better and that is WITH the right support.

"If it is... Then it's an option I would advise putting on the back burner.

I'll be honest, I wonder the same thing a lot. Like if the first forty years of my life have been trash, why would the next forty?

I don't know. And realistically, it probably won't get better. But I'll live, I'll choose to live, and I'll endure it because... I can. It's an absurd reason, but absurdist philosophy is often what's required to get us out of these moods. Nihilism tells us there is no reason and life is futile, absurdism tells us we're allowed to make up our own reasons.

And while we're making up reasons, there's also a lot of good food out there yet to be tasted. That usually motivates me to live. Your motivation may vary."	unpickmybrain1206	reply	na	na	na	0.9975194334983826	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

Consider that it grants you a unique perspective. I've noticed a big part of black culture is individuality, this is part of what makes you a unique individual. It's just as valid of a perspective as any other.

I will say this, being too black for white circles hits different than being too white for black circles. The latter may be a blow to ones self esteem, but the former can become potentially threatening."	SharpeAnimation	reply	na	na	na	0.04364980757236481	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

I was raised by my great-grandparents and I have two photos from a birthday year - one at church with other Black kids and one at my house where I'm the only Black kid. 

I was told a lot that I ""thought I was white"" because of the way I talked and due to my interests, this couldn't have been further from the truth. I'm very pro-Black, I've never wanted to be anything other than who I am, and I challenge stereotypes/assumptions when I come across them in various spaces I encounter. 

As I've gotten older, I realize that the people who try to tell me I'm too ___ or not ___ enough are the ones with the issues. They want to limit me and as I've been saying since middle school back in the late eighties, 'my ancestors didn't die for me to limit myself.' It literally comes down to people wanting to put me in a box so that I'm easily digestible and trying to fit into any type of mold i.e. other people's standards--and I'm a kind person--isn't conducive to my health and well-being. Its taken me many decades to learn this - and I'm still a work in progress. I will be so for the rest of my life, and I know that's okay because I want to keep growing.

"I've been working with my therapist for probably 4 to 6 months now.

My job laid me off last week after three long years of sexual, racial, and other harassment including a fradulent EEOC complaint saying I was ""aggressive"" and needed to ""watch my tone"".

I have no one else for support. My own sister is scared of me because I am a cis-gendered black male and she doesn't have much experience interacting with those demographics, so she's been basically raised to see us as sexually violent, aloof, arrogant, etc.

In this week's session I was very down because I've been trying so damn hard at everything and not getting anywhere especially on dating apps. Yet still I try to go to a cafe and I have to deal with a lecherous old man staring at me. I am lightskinned and alone so most everybody thinks I am gay.

She was very frustrated when I was venting, saying ""oh so you're just gonna give up?"" That shit threw me off, I told her i dont even know what giving up looks like. I should have asked her what she meant.

I don't know why she's so frustrated with me. I'm about 30 and never been on a date or had sex, and dealt with sexual and racial harassment, ostracism, physical harassment in every goddamned space I've ever been in. *I'M THE ONE WHO SHOULD BE FRUSTRATED*.

I know she's been busting her ass looking for in person group therapy and that everything is online now. Which is great, a socially isolated little kid now has to do everything online so that when the little nigglet finally gets an in person date he's so fucking off that he scares the whole damn city.

I don't understand this shit. And tho she was nice enough when I left, I heard her bout slam the door shut.  I get she's frustrated but don't take it out on me. I am in hell every fucking second of my life and I am so damned alone. I cant even watch porn because it's so humiliating that I have to watch another man's dick.

"I don't think it was helpful of the therapist to ask you if you were ""just gonna give up"", especially when you were venting. It sounds like she was a bit confrontational, and while challenging a client can be useful and even necessary, I think her timing was wrong on this. 

If you just wanted to vent she should've stayed quiet and listened, then afterwards she could've asked you how you feel about the situation and to think about how you could make any small changes so that you weren't always feeling so frustrated.

It can be very off-putting when a therapist seems to be dismissive or not giving their client a space to vent. Everyone needs to vent. It doesn't mean they need to be challenged about it every time, and a good therapist knows to put their own personal frustration aside if they can't use it to constructively help their client.

The therapist could've said something like ""I'm feeling a little frustrated because I'm having trouble figuring out how I can best help you. Is there anything about what you've just spoken about that we could work on?"" 

That might've been more constructive in the moment. Or she could've just asked ""so are you saying you want to give up?"" and you could've said yes/no/don't know and discussed things further.

Maybe next session you could bring this up, how  you're not giving up, that you just needed to vent and be listened to without being challenged, especially in a way that threw you off and made you think that you were a problem. 

That you don't mind being challenged, but her timing wasn't the best, and that she could've asked the question in a more constructive way so you could've explored different ways of managing the issues you were venting about, instead of coming away thinking she now only views you as a nuisance, which isn't helpful to you."

"I almost burst into tears today with my principal as he wanted to checkin with me about my absences and tardies since feb...this year though I have had more than I've ever in my 20 year career, 7 at this current school. 

However, since august I've dealt with my husband having mental break down, his father passing away, his mother's court case being pushed back for someone burning down her house with her in it (thankfully she survived), 3 deaths in the month of December, my daughter who has other health conditions being hospitalized for a week with pneumonia in January, my furnace breaking down for two weeks in the midst of the freezing cold temps, to the most recent of my teenager loosing a close cousin to suicide at the end of March. All while dealing with marital issues. Sprinkled throughout all of this were your everyday colds and stomach bugs with my other little people. Truthfully I have only taken one actual mental heath day for myself all year only to have found out about the sucidial death of my young cousin that day...I am not doing great and while I am aware that work keeps working, it was just too much for my principal to come to be complaining about my absences and tardies when this is not nor has ever been my pattern.. I was the person who was in 2 hrs before school started, volunteered for everything and then some and stayed late...so this year is definitely an outlier. I just wanted to cry because I know I'm not at my best but doing my best and this is what I'm given with a side of let me know how I can help when there isn't anything he can do....but this wasn't needed, I already feel like crap for being late and missing days which he knows about the reasons why for all of them....ugh! What he doesn't know and doesn't need to know about are my martial struggles.

While I know the world is not a very forgiving place, this just hit at the worse time and in the worse way...I really wanted to just get up and walk out and take the week, I am emotionally exhausted and come to work every day doing what I enjoy but ugh! 

I don't have any time to grieve...I don't have time to feel...I just don't and it's frustrating!

"Yes, I completely understand where you're coming from. I've struggled in the past and the only thing that's worked for me is shaving my head. Let me provide some context lol I don't like the amount of money, time and effort that my hair required. It's not necessarily 4C, it's more like 4B and 4A in some areas. The longest my hair was past my shoulders, I've had long, short, medium hair. I've had permed, straightened and natural hair. I've big chopped, transitioned and have done protective styles (mostly cornrows and box braids). I'm exhausted, even after I came out of my last bout with depression. What works for me now is keeping it VERY short and wearing wigs if I want long hair. There's no commitment, I have full control and I enjoy it.

As it gets longer, I know I'll keep it in updos and ponytails to keep it from touching my neck and shoulders, but that's a later problem.

My hair had been shoulder length for ever because I keep letting my haor dry out and break cuz I just don't have the energy to maintain a consistent routine...

What's helped me is to accept myself and do myself to maneuver around the issues..

When I'm too tired/over stimulated to wash/deep condition, I spray the ends and add a moisturizer the best I can and thro it into some chunky twist or a high (very loose) pony tail

When things are a lil more tolerable, I go all out or till my energy runs out and try not to beat myself up about it

So far I've fallen into washing once every 2 weeks and I stretch with a blow dry once a month..

I know I could have serious gains if I ""stepped it up"" but I've had to recognize that sometimes not doing my hair is actually self care

" Hi everyone,

I am a filmmaker passionate about raising awareness around mental health issues affecting Black men. As we know, mental health is often stigmatized in our communities, and Black men, in particular, face unique challenges in seeking help.

To address this issue, I am planning to create a short film that sheds light on the struggles and triumphs of Black men dealing with mental health issues. My aim is to spark important conversations around this topic and empower Black men to seek the support they need.

To make this project a reality, I have launched a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. I am reaching out to you all in the hope that you can support me in bringing this film to life. Even small donations can make a big difference, and I would be grateful for any contribution you can make.

If you're passionate about mental health, racial equity, and the power of film to effect change, please consider donating and sharing my campaign with your friends and family. Together, we can make a difference and help Black men get the support they need.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

I'm lucky and thankful I have my van, my laptop and some Wi-Fi because the internet and bankless payments are pretty much going to be my ticket out of this shit-hole.

Already thought that I had a job and even started working and ringing people up the first day only to be told the next day that I couldn't work there because I didn't have an ID and was handed $50 **CASH** from out of the register and told to basically leave even though I had already started. They told me the last time someone worked without ID they turned out to be an ""illegal"".

Even got frostbite on my hand trying to cook at least **some** meat last night because the propane canister leaked and shot freezing propane gas all over my hands, lucky I didn't set myself on fire.

Either people don't care or don't know about what mental impairments like autism and PTSD are so people just think I'm crazy and I had my medication stolen so I don't have any way to control the anger and pain. I barely survived the northern winters by stealing propane for heat and cooking but that hasn't stopped me from losing all of my body fat down to the bones. I look like a walking skeleton and I have no idea how I'm able to still fight.

My adoptive parents know where I'm at but refuse to do absolutely anything at all and want to basically just live in peace and retirement until they die in their all white paradise. They don't even want to think about the possibility that I could be shot any day now.

When I reached out to my biological cousin he tried telling me that I had the ""wrong number"" before I told him that I didn't and he was basically forced into dialogue with me. He obviously doesn't know what to do but it's clear that letting me at the **least** park somewhere safe is obviously out of the question. I'm tired.

The white people look at me with disgust and because I already have such a hard time struggling with the way I look and the way my hair looks (because my white parents didn't give a shit nor take the time to ever teach me how to take care of my kind of hair) I walk around with a ski mask. Which obviously doesn't help things but I just hate people looking at me. Been here for a month and only made $50??? I don't know how I still find the drive to continue. Can't even put gas in the fucking van to get out of this shit-hole, I know people see me out here fucking starving but are too disgusted or scared to even do something.

I'm not going back to the shelters, I'm not checking myself into a psych-ward, I want a fucking job and weed in my blunt and that's it. Why can't society leave me the fuck alone? Like I don't know how to work or haven't had an apartment before. The problem has always been misunderstanding, ableism, colorism, racism, all the of it! I'm not even a felon."

"Good morning! I‚Äôm grateful to have seen your post and be able to compose a quick response, this morning before I need to head towards a medical appointment.

You sound as though you aren‚Äôt feeling all that great and that that‚Äôs been going on for a while.

Are you in a position to devote some attention to the aspects of your existence that you are enjoying? I‚Äôd love to hear about your strengths. What skills do you possess that are uniquely yours? You composed the message that I‚Äôll read and respond to, this morning, before I address the day‚Ä¶

I understand that you describe yourself as being autistic and having PTSD. Please tell me that you‚Äôve got an uncanny skill with hermit crabs or that no one can build a paper airplane that stays aloft, as yours can or that you compose music that stills toddlers - share something that will inspire me to want to know more about you beyond how your hand is recovering from the LP burn‚Ä¶

In this space, we can discuss your POWER, friend. Homelessness, theft and mental illness are challenges, yes‚Ä¶
The raw power of your soul - that strength‚Ä¶

We can build a fortress, monuments to that unquenchable strength that none of the isms can breach.

Help me help you‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll check back on you, later!

"It happened again the other night. I was putting things in my vehicle and I couldn't help but notice this crusty white dude from the corner of my eyes who kept staring at me and it was making me anxious.

I asked the fucker what he was looking at and he came over and shoved me talking about how he was in combat before. He asserted that I was probably stealing from someone else's vehicle and asked: ""What are you doing here?""

After forcefully stating that the things in the vehicle belonged to **me** he refused to back away from me and even went as far as to start growling. It was real simple from there.

Called him what he deserved and gave him about two strikes to the face, closed fist and the fucker stumbled backwards and caught himself on the car behind him. I told him to ""get up"" before offering one last strike which ended it and damn near broke my right hand. Dude even said: ""ugh"" after that first hit landed."

But seriously fuck them all. I used to deny the fact that instinctively there's an inner jealousy of people in regards with black men.  However,  the more I read about psychology,  psycchopathy, human psyche,  the more I realize how much the world is upside-down to help people that are down to cope with themselves.  

Don't fucking give up on those stupid morons. Evil ignorant people. Judging, biased and insecure.  If you're here talking about this,  you've already one step ahead.  It's okay.  You can be atheist, but I am telling you   from my perspective, we are stronger than most people and that's why. From a purely physical and instinctive way and that fucks up with a lot of people that can't accept that.

 So they create bigger weapons to deal with their feelings of lack of power. But we are all powerlessat the end, which makes everything that is happening senseless... They cope with us in the most sneaky and denigrating way because of that. Don't think you're crazy because others can't see.YOU DON'T NEED THEM.

"It is, but you gotta break out of the cycle. 

I've been thriving since doing so, partially but not entirely because it's removed me from environments of dejection and malaise. Life has been comparatively euphoric, since. 

Now, there is a cruel reality out there: unless you find yourself in an extraordinary setting, many of life's levers will be tilted against you. That could feel defeating, and it can even be defeating. 

I see a bright side to it though: it means we're tough as nails. Lots of these other folks who cohabitate Planet Earth with us - and I'm thinking now of a particular group - frankly aren't, and therefore won't be able to hack it when the climate crisis really starts grinding down on us (a process which has already begun, but which is unfortunately disproportionately affecting our brothers and sisters in the motherland currently), simply because they've grown soft and fragile during their centuries of favorable circumstances. 

So: for now, things can be extraordinarily difficult. And while we all wish there weren't such a necessity for it, our exceptional resilience is something I am constantly in awe of.

All I can suggest is to start practicing standing up for yourself if you haven't already. If you know you didn't do it and someone accuses you, ask them why they think you did it.

They know they can get away with it because it's your word versus theirs and their word will win. 

I was accused of really weird and petty things because I kept trying to insert myself in a place I very clearly didn't belong. If I got too close, suddenly I did ""something"" and everyone knew before I even found out about it. Sometimes, I was accused of ""things"" when I wasn't even around to do it or against people I've never even seen before.

"Hello Reddit,

As a fit guy standing at 6'3 of African descent, I never thought that my appearance could be perceived as intimidating until recently. Despite having a successful career and having no issues with women, I have noticed that people may not find me as likeable as others. This realization dawned on me when I was posted overseas for a job, where I noticed that my expat counterparts, who were not very comfortable in social situations, were greeted warmly by everyone in the office. In contrast, despite making an effort to engage in conversations with my colleagues, I would only receive a couple of grumbled and soft greetings, sometimes even none at all.

I come from a sales background, and I don't have any trouble talking to people that I don't know. I have always made an effort to start a conversation with my colleagues and have even asked for help or advice on good places to go. However, I still find it hard to connect with other men, even those who come across as timid. It has been getting me down lately, and I wonder if I am just unlikeable.

I know I shouldn't worry too much about this, but it has been bothering me. Has anyone else experienced a similar situation? Any advice on how to approach this? Thank you for reading."	Clear-Victory1956	post	33.28513722573925	male	White	0.9906360507011414	na	na	na	8	BlackMentalHealth

This has ultimately led me to a socially isolative and lonely life. Always being seen as the enemy, while everyone else gets to be welcomed as a member of a tribe.

You're in Australia correct? I hear so much about the racism there. It's definitely gonna be rough to navigate because you can't ask a person to accept you if they are committed to not accepting you. It's hard to tell you what you could try with your coworkers since what your describing is pretty vague. I would say number one is do good at your job so that you could transfer out with a good reference hopefully if it comes to that. You should still be friendly and smile but if you try to engage and they don't give you anything back just politely smile go back to your work. Also, maybe try looking for groups with other Africans in your area, just so that you still have some people to talk to who you can be more sure are not going to be racist.

"In my experience it has nothing to do with you but themselves. 
For example in state of California depending the location many people are unfriendly & disregard your efforts when greeting them. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs due to a faster paste of living, traffic, cost of living, stress, etc.
When I go to a different state the majority of people are very friendly, talkative & courteous. When I greet them they smile back & reply. It could be because it‚Äôs a slower paste environment, little to no traffic, lower cost of living.
Another example at work is that I get to travel to different locations to pick up hours. Some offices they are very friendly other offices are the complete opposite.

At first I thought many of my issues were because I grew up in a mostly white area, but now I‚Äôm not so sure.

I‚Äôve been invisible and unwanted for as long as I can remember. People have always looked at me like I was a bad person, constantly assuming the worst possible things about me. It was like most of the people I met just felt disgust and would project as much negativity at me as they could to get me to go away or whatever. 

I couldn‚Äôt even go to my parents because they did the same thing. It‚Äôs a horrible feeling to have your mother and father think your a disgusting awful person, accusing me of trying to mess up my life on purpose, waste their money, and trying to hurt people.

I was never good enough, and the only thing that could make it all go away was achievement. Either I was the smartest, the fastest and most athletic, or the funniest, or I was invisible and worthless. Especially with my parents.

Now I‚Äôm in grad school, I‚Äôve struggled with making friends throughout undergrad because it just doesn‚Äôt seem like people want me around. The last time I felt invisible and tried to talk to people bad things happened.

"I'm real sick and tired of Black men's misogyny and it's never-ending popularity. I saw an article in my recommended feed on Bing this morning that was nothing but misogynistic BS, weaponizing the hypersexuality myth/stereotype against Black women. And of course, it was written by a Black man who claims his site is ""for the Black community"" and ""against division.""

Because Black women are so ""hypersexual"" they deserve to be disrespected, mistreated, discriminated against in every walk of life. Really, he believed Black women having higher rates of unemployment was due to Black women being ""hypersexual."" 

It's funny because if you said Black men's hyper-criminality and poor excuse for parenting (absenteeism) are to blame for how they're treated, they would scream bloody murder and accuse you of being a white supremacist sellout. Yet, it's okay for them to do that to Black women?

Here's a hint, if being a ""good, intelligent, non-aggressive"" Black person didn't stop people from being racist towards you, then being a ""modest, docile, asexual"" woman won't stop misogyny. 

It saddens me when I see Black women internalizing this misogynoir, but I'm not too hard on them because it's like racism.

and before anyone comments on this with ""not all men"" and ""don't generalize Black men"", think about how the men in your personal lives speak about and treat Black women vs how they speak about other races and genders. and especially LOUD and/or dark-skinned Black women who confidently take up space. [and consider looking into this](https://repository.charlotte.edu/islandora/object/etd%3A820/datastream/PDF/download/citation.pdf). when it comes to Bw and other women, we're hoes and bitches and they're women.

oh and don't even get me started on how a lot of Black families are with their daughters vs. their sons.

 even intersectionality was born from this. Black women who experience violence by men in our community often don't disclose due to fears of police brutality or stereotyping of Black men. 

and you can love someone deeply, but still have misogynistic beliefs. look at chris rock who's made a career off of clowning on Black people in general. and it's okay to take that in but we've gonna work through that when you know

we love y'all. but if you do love us, work with us when we discuss this instead of throwing it back in our face that you specifically aren't doing this to Bw (not believing us on our lived experiences is also misogynior btw).

it's not us vs. you unless you're invalidating our experiences instead of working with us to erase misogyny in our community. otherwise, how are we supposed to thrive together when Bw are constantly getting stepped on despite doing so much work for the community and being active leaders. like in BLM, when shaun king got a ton of credit for it and not the three Bw who created it"	dirtylittlerabbits	reply	na	na	na	0.9993497729301453	weak	no	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
"Hey, I posted here something similar but in reverse. I feel you.

Misogynoir is 100% a problem in our community. The intersection of being a black man still involves being a man and misogyny is a problem that exists at that intersection regardless of where you approach it from. Misogyny sucks in all forms, but I can only imagine how much more it must hurt coming from people that are supposed to be on your side.

>Here's a hint, if being a ""good, intelligent, non-aggressive"" Black person didn't stop people from being racist towards you, then being a ""modest, docile, asexual"" woman won't stop misogyny.

There are men of color will decry racism yet demand to be patriarchs and completely fail to understand that, in our world, one of those things cannot exist without the other. The nuclear family, the ""everyman,"" are just two concepts that were created directly by the same people that tried systematically to breed an entire race out of existence through assimilation.

Every other group of people has their voice heard when they speak, and their needs are met by an empathetic and compassionate society. 
When Black men voice our concerns, we‚Äôre PROMPTLY SHAMED, INSULTED, and told to SHUT UP and focus on sacrificing for everyone else, EXCEPT ourselves. Society seems to truly have us at the very bottom of the hierarchy, and any attempts by us to think above our station are immediately met with vitriol and humiliation from everyone, even the women in our community. 

As a victim of sexual abuse from women throughout my childhood (and some of my adulthood), my voice on my trauma almost always falls on deaf ears. If my experiences aren‚Äôt completely ignored, then they‚Äôre bombarded with shaming and emasculation tactics (‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt handle being touched by a woman? Lol‚Äù ‚ÄúOk, but what did YOU do?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell you probably did X, Y, and Z‚Äù ‚ÄúWomen don‚Äôt do that, you men do!‚Äù ‚ÄúLol payback for what men do to us!‚Äù Etc.) 

It gets so fucking annoying being the enemy in a war that I‚Äôm not fighting. Even moreso when everyone else not only gets called courageous and brave, but also receive a damn-near infinite supply of compassion and support from society when they voice their concerns. But Black men just get shit on and told to go back to work and accept our role in society as the punching bag and sacrificial lamb. 

Living in this world as a Black man almost makes me want to turn my lights off permanently, but I know that too many people (some here) would jump for joy at the sight of their dead fabricated enemy. So I‚Äôll keep on living, no matter how much it hurts."		post	24.72736064037457	female	White	0.9977268576622009	na	na	na	10	BlackMentalHealth

And still throw Black people under the bus because they feel they're different and better. Just a little heads up. 

I have to care what where people do and nonblack people in general because from my experience, when I'm in spaces with a sizable amount of nonblack people, they work against. I don't know what makes them do it but they've been doing it to me since I was a child. I 100% do think they have a problem with ""aggressive"" Black people to shame Black people into not standing up for themselves and Blackness.

3. Gain some courage ask your white therapist the reason for your troubles with white people maybe rooted from. 


It‚Äôs perfectly healthy for you to have strong feelings over racial trauma, it‚Äôs even better when you can find a way to get past and acknowledge it in different ways.

What helped me personally was returning to my roots. Learning about AA history and not the sanitized version of history that they teach in schools. For me, it contextualizes how the world came to be and how some people are. That context helps me rationalize many of my past experiences down into some shape, form, or fashion of post-colonialism or white supremacy.

"It's exhausting to feel the strain of exclusion from people aligning themselves with whiteness. Idk all about what it's like in the UK but in the USA other non-black marginalized groups are more than happy to take from black culture but stand firmly on our necks to get one step closer to the top. It's sad. The saddest part to me is that the way white supremacy functions best is to have this fucked up ladder and let the lower rungs do all their dirty work for them, and then get kicked down themselves. White supremacists are more than happy to let Priti Patel or Rishi Sunak be the foot soldiers of their bullshit, but no white English person who is a white supremacist will ever see them as English. Here in the USA some of the people holding up white supremacy the hardest are not white, and they're gonna have to learn the hard way that they will never, ever be at the top of the ladder no matter how hard they kicked down everyone else. Here a bunch of Asian students have gotten conned into a lawsuit that will end any race considerations in admissions because they seem to think that Ivy League universities will then accept more Asian students, and they're so fucking wrong.

"I get really angry when I see injustice especially if it's something I could relate to. It's not uncommon for that to turn into bitterness. For example, being a darkskinned Black woman I've seen how ppl treat us and it's not kind. Even online where they pretend to care about us I notice a lot of double standards. They expect Black women to take there bs but when we cry out for help we're ""playing victim/being too sensitive"" but if we stand up for ourselves people start twisting narratives and acting like we're the aggressors. This type of behavior is like ""damned if you don't, damned if you do"". And it's especially infuriating bc people cheer most people on if they ""stand up for themselves"" but when it comes to Black women, it don't fucking apply. You either gotta sit there and not react as violently as they do to you so they could know you're the victim but they don't actually empathize with you as a human being.

"I recently saw a really cool video explaining how that double-description thing in AAVE (African-American Vernacular English) that we do, like for example, ""Oh, that's a *baby*-baby,"" is a direct holdover from Yoruba language structure. One of the examples in the video was how the word for ""to cut hair"" is essentially said twice if you mean ""barber,"" or someone who cuts hair professionally. It gives emphasis, *and* can change the meaning on another level.

So it's not just a weird, funny, ""incorrect"" thing that ""Black people do."" It's a thing that ""Black people"" *never stopped doing,* despite the slavers' systems for trying to strip language and culture from people they brutalized and held in bondage for centuries. 

Learning about it left me really feeling a complicated some type of way. It should have held a note of fascinated glee at connection to knowledge and culture, of learning something cool. But that got overswept by a tide of sorrow, another rending cry of, *""It was never my fault.""* 

And that's a whole mess to untangle already, as a reaction. But every time I learn something REAL about history in the US, it brings this feeling. The trauma of enlightenment. The understanding that the pains of shame and self-doubt and fear were put on me on purpose, with methods passed down and perfected over centuries. 

And I know that if I presented all of the evidence, the mountains and mountains of it, stacked it all up in piles high and wide and broad enough to cover their houses of government and their monuments victorious and bury every plantation still standing, called on them to answer for every drop of blood and every shed tear and every cry in the morning, noon, and night, they would still find a way to wave me away. Because their comfort is more important than our survival.

A lot have antiblackness embedded in their cultures and think Black people deserve any trials and tribulations we have to withstand. They 100% punch down on poor Black ppl and if you're trying to get out of that horrible situation and make it whatever area they're in, they make it hard for you to be there.

"Hey everyone. 

I‚Äôve been recently struggling with feelings of failure and inadequacy after receiving a mediocre ‚Äúneeds improvement‚Äù eval at work. I‚Äôve been with my organization for a little over two years and in my current role for the past six or so months and have been dedicated to my job. I‚Äôve received similar evaluations from my past employers but this has hit me particularly hard because I felt that I had grown past it in a new role with a supportive manager. This negative feedback has left me feeling like a failure to launch.

The evaluation stated that my growth has only been incremental and that I need to improve before my next evaluation or risk being demoted or let go. While criticism is part of any job it‚Äôs difficult to not take it personally and I feel like a failure. I feel like I‚Äôve let myself and everyone around me down especially since I‚Äôm only one of a handful of black folks in a PWLI. I feel like I‚Äôm not succeeding in my career as I had hoped. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do where to turn. I‚Äôm struggling with my mental health and self esteem, and I‚Äôm looking for guidance and support to help me navigate this difficult time. I‚Äôm open to therapy or counseling I but I don‚Äôt know where to start or what resources are available to me. If anyone has any recommendations on how to cope with feelings of failure and navigate the pressure I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you."

"Your feelings of doubt are justifiable. The feeling you're experiencing right now deserves some space to exist so that you can figure out what all the other companion emotions are.

Once you get to those, you can then ask...how does the feedback reflect on who I am as a human? What message are they sending me? Do I agree with that message? If so, am I okay with that? If not, what do I need here?

Those are the types of question my therapist would ask me. 

It can be difficult, especially when there are only a few of us. Places stay wanting to talk about their 'commitment to diversity' but in my experience its nothing more than lip service and/or performative allyship. They need to stop and take a look at why hiring initiatives exist, short version is that most workplaces are toxic AF and 'promoting diversity' is a way to act like they're working to enact change when they're really not. 

I would start by looking for Black therapists in your area. You can search the Psychology Today site using specific criteria. Full disclosure, my therapist isn't Black. She does have Black folks in her heart/life and she will call out things like racism/classisim/sexism, etc. and the unique sets of challenges I interact with on the regular. Sometimes by the time I get to session I'm so tired and beat down I can't think things through, so it helps to have an objective observer there to confirm I've been 'set up' when impostor syndrome rears its ugly head."

"Ooohhhh, I feel you so much right now. I'm in my first ever executive position, and in the past like...six months?...it suddenly whiplashed from ""everything seems to be going great!"" to ""holy shit, why are folks sneaking around on my board trying to play Game of Thrones???"" It's fucking wild, and I've been catching nine kinds of hell from all kinda angles even though I've been trying my damnedest for almost two solid years to do something that's never been tried before, on a giant scale, all by my fuckin' self. 

So I sit back and ask myself: what have they done for me lately? And more importantly, what have they done for Geoffreigh?

Geoffreigh is the 41-year-old Ivy League MBA who sits in this seat in an alternate universe. Geoffreigh drives a Tesla. He probably eats superfoods. But not that one. It would make his whisky collection sad (and he knows the difference between whisky and whiskey).

If Geoffreigh was in this seat, doing these things, what would they be providing him to ensure he could do these things to the mediocre-est of his ability? What kinds of expectations and communications would Geoffreigh be receiving? What kinds of management behaviors would be on display? What might he be expecting as his rightful due course, when faced with a problem that would stress me the hell out? How might he expect people to support him, in those times?

If I have not been provided at least 0.9 Geoffries of support, you best bet 1.0 of your ass that I am not about to feel like I've failed. Sure, I will look back through my actions with a strategic eye and go, ""Hmm. I could have done that differently, maybe I'll approach that from another angle next time."" But I absolutely *will not* take on a pack mule's burden of blame for putting out a whole block of dumpster fires if all I'm given is a rusty bucket and a busted hydrant. 

There's enough people out there who will keep you running yourself into the goddamn ground with unfair expectations. Level your eye when you look at those criticisms, love. Work is a two-way contract. They owe you the tools and framework of support necessary to do the job properly, and if that is lacking, that's on them, too."

"Are there other women here who have had to go no contact with a parent due to their narcissistic behavior? I've gone through this over the last 5 years and I rarely encounter other black women who have also done this outside of my group coaching program. 

In the last couple of years ""narcissist"" has become a buzzword, but there definitely isn't enough focus on narcissistic parents and the effects of their abuse on their adult children. I feel like the issue is compounded for black women because we already experience the trauma that comes with being black and women. 

As mother's day approaches, I thought I would share some resources that have helped me over the years that are specifically for black women. It took a long time to find these pockets of support and they have truly kept me going and helped me make real progress in my healing journey.

* [Stephanie Perry's Youtube Channel-](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhrmspEaRyQ) she helps black women leave abusive dynamics behind and live their dreams abroad. Great content to think about while considering no contact or relocation after no contact. She is also connected to a slew of other black women who offer services specifically for black women. My life and mindset have completely changed since discovering her a few years ago. IG:@Vaycarious
* [Alecia Renece's Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PLwIhMBGxg) (& Podcast)- she helps black women reject narratives that harm them and embrace joy instead. She also makes healing music for black women that makes me feel SOOOOO loved. IG:@aleciarenece

Not perfect but she was absolutely a chaos matrix, pathological liar, thief, and worse. And the worst part is that I was made more the villain for choosing to end the relationship than she ever was for being, basically, a criminal and an abuser.

I know I'm not the only black woman who had a childhood that was basically destroyed by having this kind of mom and, often, those wounds don't begin to heal until we're truly aware enough to begin doing the work.

"For some of us, [Black Nonbelievers, Inc.](https://www.instagram.com/bnonbelieversinc/) is a refuge. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/c/BlackNonbelieversInc) is their YT channel. 

My birth mom wasn't a narcissist, but I strongly suspect that she--like me--was on the autism spectrum. I suspect there are a lot of undiagnosed mental health situations in my family of origin due to the intergenerational trauma, poverty, and religious dogma. 

I've been NC with my family and extended family for 20 years and I'm still actively working to heal from all of the nonsense. I got blamed for basically everything and that lead to zero boundaries and was raised in a codependent culture which negatively impacted the way I saw/felt about myself and ultimately the relationships I developed as an adult. Going NC, starting to therapy and declaring that I love myself wasn't enough unfortunately - I needed to understand that my worldview and the way I handled my relationships--people pleasing/codependent/zero boundaries--wasn't healthy.

I look around at people my age and many of them only talk to their families because they're related to them or because they can get 'help' from them which usually comes with/is given with strings attached. Again, its the culture (the south) and people refusing to engage with the long-standing religious influence that continues to go without critical engagement.

As I get older, I'm starting to think that my best bet is to seek out people who are liberated from their families. The people I know who are engaged in those types of dynamics (codependent, narcissistic coping/social mechanisms) with their families are quick to repeat those patterns because they don't know any other way. If I met people who did have healthy relationships--instead of a bunch of people like 'well, my family could be worse' as a rationale to continue to engage with people who aren't kind to them--I'd be open to seeking community with them, but it hasn't happened yet. Part of that is on me, because I tend to shy away from people who are heavily dependent on their families to begin with. I would love to develop a community of folks who are anticapitalist (as this mindset contributes tremendously to trauma-dependent structures) and also doing this work, but I've accepted that its either going to develop or it won't.

"I was going to share this under the autism sub but I feel more comfy here.

Recently I‚Äôve been seeing this dude and I really really like him, we‚Äôve only been talking for 8 months and he‚Äôs literally my dream person. He always there and treats me like a regular person! 

But recently things been to perfect (it always been) so I‚Äôve started having intrusive thoughts back to when men literally treated like shit. I‚Äôm scared that this might happen again. I started to distance myself from him and making up excuses for why we can‚Äôt hang out. 

I‚Äôm just scared that he might be like the others. Playing nice just to use me or abuse me. 

I just want the thoughts to go away because I love being around him and it‚Äôs making this vetting stage hard. He hates it when I don‚Äôt him things are lie about my feelings. But I don‚Äôt wanna tell him stuff for certain reasons. 

Reason 1: I don‚Äôt want him use my trauma against me and give him a blueprint 

Reason 2: I NEVER EVER tell my partners about my past relationships (I don‚Äôt like to carry trauma over to the next person) 

I would love to hear any advice or similar experiences"	Turbulent_Coconut570	post	12.379648683217985	female	White	0.003944460302591324	na	na	na	1	BlackMentalHealth
"I have trauma in my past, too. What I've found is that I can disclose at different ""levels"" depending on how comfortable I feel and what's appropriate for the relationship. 

I think about it kind of like a graph, or matrix. I plot things like trust level with that person, my comfort level, and minimum ""need to know"" that will allow us to continue to function without disturbing *their* comfort level. When I think through that, maybe I come up with ""Level 3 Disclosure,"" or however I rank it. 

That might look like, ""Hey. Some hurtful stuff has happened in my past around this type of situation. And I don't want to go into details, because it's still kinda hard for me to talk about, but I want to be transparent and just communicate that I'm still re-learning how to navigate relationships, but I really like what we've got going on, and I would really like to continue."" 

From there, I may give some additional thoughts about triggers and how I navigate them, and how the other person can navigate them, based on my thoughts and planning. Giving people something they can *do,* in a proactive or active way, and not just feel like they're standing by and watching things happen, can decrease frustration and distancing. 

So maybe that goes like, ""Sometimes I feel anxious about the past. And it's not you doing something wrong. But I might need some space to calm down and get my head on right and come back feeling better again. Can we collaborate on a way I can communicate that to you and keep you in the loop that feels like good information, so we can get back to this good thing ASAP when that comes up?""

But you can use this method to develop a script for discussion with ANYONE you have in your life. Friends, lovers, coworkers, whoever. Set categories however you want, for how you group your relationships. Decide how deep you want to go with your levels of disclosure, and what is appropriate for which settings, which groups, etc. Then start writing your scripts:

* How do you state the fact of trauma? ""Some hurtful things happened in the past,"" is one example. ""There is a history of trauma in my background,"" is another thing you can say that's more clinical. With some folks, you may feel comfortable slowly telling them exactly what happened. It just depends.  
* What boundaries do you have about the conversation? ""I don't want to go into details,"" is an example. What are the limits for that level of disclosure? Where can you push back and point to the boundaries if people ask questions you don't want to answer? This protects your pain points so you don't get re-traumatized by the conversation.  
* Bare minimum information about the effect on your ability to function in the relationship. What's relevant about your current state, and how the trauma impacts the other person? Not the whole deal. And frame it in a positive way, if you can. ""I want to communicate openly,"" can be good framing, because...you really do! Part of you *wants* to let people know, and have them understand, right? And a statement like, ""I'm re-learning how to navigate relationships,"" is *also* true. But it's not putting yourself down like you're ""broken"" or ""fucked-up."" You're learning, just like everybody else out there, and you're committed to picking back up and trying again.  
* State a positive, if you can, and if you think it's needed. Make your needs known, as context for why you're sharing this, or reiterate and reinforce the value of the person with whom you're sharing. ""I like what we've got going on, and I would like to continue,"" or, ""I value our friendship, and the fact that you've been there for me without judgement over the years,"" are some examples. 

For the piece about what they can do, there's a similar formula: 

* Describe your trigger point. For me, it might be, ""The holidays are tough for me."" That's a very low-level disclosure. I could say that to a casual acquaintance or coworker, and expect them to have some patience with me, without having to go into my whole entire story. But now I know that I don't have to hide as much when I'm having that tough time, and I don't have that added stress of working to hide that I'm struggling.  
* Affirm that it's not about them. Sometimes you don't have to say much more than just, ""The holidays are tough for me."" But sometimes you do have to explain, ""When this situation comes up that's hard for me because of the past, it's not about you.""  
* Talk about the steps that you take, on your own power, to work on it. AND what you need in order to do that. Because if it's not about them, they don't need to be the ones to solve it. They can *support* it, but showing that *you're* the one who's going to work on it is a responsible move. In my example about the holidays, I might say, ""I may be slow to respond to texts and calls, but I want you to know I'm not mad or anything. I just need a little extra 'me time' to stay balanced around this time of year. But I do feel the love when you reach out, and I love you right back, even if I leave you on read.""  
* If you need to build or repair the relationship, find something collaborative you can do around it. For example, ask how you can communicate your needs in a way that is comfortable for them, that also fits within your capacity to act when you are feeling triggered. Make it a team project. Or design some kind of joint activity, like, ""When I need to take a couple days away, I'll make a playlist of five good songs I think you'll enjoy, and I'll send it to you when I'm ready to get back out and see people again. If/when you're ready to reconnect, just let me know. Playlist review write-up is optional."" That can turn it into something constructive. Maybe give you something to focus on and distract you from those intrusive thoughts and panicked feelings, for example. And if you both have a sense of humor about the ""review"" portion of it, maybe it would flip the script on the whole situation, you know?

I hope this is helpful."	Turbulent_Coconut570	reply	na	na	na	0.003944460302591324	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"I use to think that something was really, really wrong with me. I grew up with three other siblings but I was not close with any of them. I was bullied and made fun of at school and had to go home and be constantly criticized there. I was a somewhat quirky awkward kid. I suffered from symptoms of ADHD. Because I wasn‚Äôt really accepted at home or at school my escape from reality was books. I fell in love with books and always had one wherever I went. It was the ONLY thing I had. Reading was comforting to me and it was my escape from the pain of everything I was forced to deal with growing up. I eventually grew into an adult and I encountered even more challenges. People avoided me because I was socially awkward and well‚Ä¶I was just plain weird! I didn‚Äôt know any better I didn‚Äôt have friends growing up I was virtually isolated as a child. So me being thrust into adulthood and being expected to know how to interact with others and carry myself in a manner that was appropriate in society was TOO MUCH for me. I went from one job to another due to the things I struggled with having ADD. My colleagues thought I was clueless and lazy. They would even make fun of me. It was so hurtful. I had to go through all of that without any kind of support. It hurt me seeing others with their friends going out having fun, making memories. I didn‚Äôt have that. 

When I was upset and needed to talk with someone‚Ä¶I couldn‚Äôt. Because I had no one to confide in. I know some people might say that‚Äôs for the better. However it wasn‚Äôt because. I had NO ONE to actually listen to me. So I had all of these pent up emotions with no way to let it out.  Often times I‚Äôd end up having explosive angry outburst because I had no kind of outlet for my emotions. I‚Äôd destroy things and hit things. 

I‚Äôm actually tearing up writing this because it was SO SO hard! I don‚Äôt wish this kind of loneliness and helplessness on anyone. I think it‚Äôs important that we have someone who is willing to just listen. Because when you don‚Äôt all you‚Äôre left with is anger and bitterness. I can in some ways see why some people do some of the things they do when they have never had anyone to be there for them.

"Absolutely not. My mom gave me anxiety, a distorted and negative body image, and bad coping mechanisms (purposely keeping to myself and rejecting help and comfort from friends/family).

"I've recently come to realize some patterns in my behavior that I'm gonna look into with my therapist. I think they've been around for a long time, but I've been seeing them more often lately as I've been encountering people in my job who are generally problematic in different ways, and some of whom are upset with me, specifically. 

I honestly think they're being really out of pocket on a lot of this stuff, and some folks who are pretty reasonable seem to be aligned with that. And I've identified some areas of both improvement on my end AND systemic improvements in other areas that will address the actual operational issues they're talking about. Their personal beef with other folks involved is a whole other issue. 

But I'm noticing that, part of me gets really stressed about how hard it is to move shit forward with all of this going on. And part of me just stands there, cool as a cucumber, and goes, ""Hm. This is fascinating."" And not like, morbidly fascinating. And not even particularly excited. But just like, collecting data. Checking out who's talking and who's not, and what the body language and cues are on the people who are not talking, and taking notes and building a backlog.

Like, ""Oh, this person is not feeling heard and validated right now. Oh, this person *said* they want X, but that's not what's motivating them today."" And I'll wait until everybody's got it out of their system and drop something into the conversation to move it forward. 

Which is not a bad thing. That's my job, kinda. I'm a leader, in a room full of leaders, and my actual job is to coordinate them. So I need to keep it moving. 

But like...I got asked, point-blank, in a one-on-one conversation, ""What do you think should happen about [big, huge, important decision]?"" And I was like, ""Meh. Doesn't really matter. As a collective group, the board needs to figure that out. Whatever happens, I'm gonna make it work."" And because it was a personal-level conversation, too, with someone I can trust to say these kind of things to, I added, ""Look, the way I've approached life so far is to just try things. I've landed on my feet so far, and there's always another way. Regardless."" Basically, even if this crashes and burns...I'll be somewhere, and I'll be somewhere else, and tomorrow's still gonna come, and there's a ""somewhere"" out there for that, too. 

But when I was driving back home, I started thinking about this really odd sense of...apathy? I have. About everything. Not in a negative way. Not morose, or hopeless. Just kinda, ""Okay. Well. Nothing matters, might as well give this a shot. Sure, why not."" Nothing has any real weight, to me, in a weird way. 

And like...from moment to moment, situation to situation, I fully believe who I am and what I'm saying, for almost the same reason. It's a bit hard to explain. I feel like sometimes I might would get accused of contradicting myself? Or not being in alignment with something I said earlier? And part of that might be genuine memory loss, that's a huge problem for me. But part of it is also just that, I really believe what I'm saying, in that moment, and maybe I just...don't have a sense that it's connected to anything else? 

I know dissociation is something I struggle with. But I'm starting to feel like this might be a bigger problem than I thought. I honestly don't think I know what it's like to live outside my own head. I don't think I've ever been 100% present, and if I have, it's been so distressing I couldn't handle it. I don't know if I could handle the sensory experience of being fully present. I don't know if I could handle the emotional experience. Shit, just the idea of it is raising my heart rate. 

I dunno. I guess I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with this?"	multirachael	post	26.52585397123135	female	White	0.004619294311851263	na	na	na	1	BlackMentalHealth

"I'm sorry if this ain't the best place to post a question like this.. I'm not sure where else I can even go on the internet for dating help.

For a couple months I've been on 4 dating apps. I've worked on my bio, uploaded decent pictures (although I'm either alone or with my cats which I do understand is not a great look).

I've been able to get likes and even start some convos with women, but whenever I try and make the next step to have an in person date or sometimes a video chat, it falls off a cliff. Either they're busy and they'll ""let me know"" when they're free, or just don't respond.

My therapist (a black woman) always tells me to write things down before I say them so I can be confident that it sounds good, but since I have no experience I just can't tell if it's possible that I'm doing something wrong. I'm always polite in my messages, I suggest a date and time, and I'm never forcing or pressing to go on a date lol.

My question for the men is, is there something I can do better?

"I‚Äôll say it quick. I had a lot of successes on Tinder and hinge, mostly hookups and a few relationships.

"I can't discount anyone else's experiences, but this is a recurring discussion point on Reddit and elsewhere. 

I've used them before, gone out on dates, and had one relationship. But I was stood up a few times. I also got the sense that sometimes women were just getting their ego massaged by the constant barrage of dudes. That could be what you are experiencing. People meeting on dating apps has become even more common since then, so that barrage has probably intensified. Please don't beat yourself up about it if it hasn't worked out for you so far. 

""Let me check my schedule"" or ""I'll let you know"" usually means no.

"It sounds like you're on the right track! You just have to keep going. Dating apps are hard bc it may seem like everyone else is constantly meeting up with people but I'm a woman and on them a fair amount and I still only go on dates with a handful of different people per year off of them. Tbh I dislike that I have to guide the convo heavily. Being a great conversationalists (some substance and not just flirting or what are you doing rn?) and showing off your interests and hobbies help to break the ice and make women want to be with you. Consider putting a question on your profile like ""Where are we going for our first date? You chose an activity and I'll choose the food afterwards."" That'll weed out people who don't want to meet in person. Its ok to explicitly state on your profile that you are looking for people who are willing to meet in person and see how it goes from there. 

Also there's a sweet spot for meeting. For me, if I am talking to a person for 2+ weeks and they don't mention possibly meeting or speaking on the phone I can assume that they are one of those people who just want to talk to you via text but never do anything. But at the same time, I rarely meet up with someone who as soon as we match, they ask if we can meet up. Maybe you're messaging people for too long or too short.  

When offering up a date, NEVER ask people to hang out at your home for your first date. For women (and any gender tbh), that can be very very dangerous and many of us won't do that. If you're constantly doing that, you may be weeding out people who are actually interested in you. Ask the other person if they have anything they'd like to do. Make sure to be direct yet accommodating. I hate when someone asks me out on a date but I have to set and decide everything, it should be a collaboration. For example, you may suggest ""Would you like to go on a coffee date sometime this weekend?"" and then if she says yes, ask her if there's a time or location she prefers. I also prefer for a first date to not be too intensive, expensive (bc I often go dutch or pay for my own), in unpopulated areas, or at odd times. For example, some guy asked for me to play cards with him in his car at midnight as a first time meeting up. He was immediately blocked. Something during the day, or in the evening and just for a few hours with the potential for it to go longer if I'm feeling the person. 

Also consider the apps that you are on. I like apps where people directly know who liked them and can easily match without having to flip through a ton of profiles. 

Highlight great things about your life - if you have weird or overly sexual information on your profile, you may find some people but its going to limit you. Don't put anything controversial, creepy or makes you seem nasty/rude on there."	TunnelVizin845	reply	na	na	na	0.9994739890098572	weak	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

This is part of the reality of dating apps. When I first made my profile, I got 100 likes the first two weeks and a steady flow of them as time continued. You'd think I was on a date nearly every week. I probably went on a date once or twice a month (my refusal to hook up contributed to this). 

I just wouldn't vibe with many of the women I met up there and I guess many of them felt likewise. I've had plenty of conversations just suddenly die or been ghosted. If you're getting likes and starting convos, you're already doing something right. 

To find out where I might have been going wrong in the talking phase, I personally used to role-play with a friend and she'd help me understand where we might be fucking up in the talking phase. I learned that I can be a pretty huge asshole just off of getting another perspective of my own cadence. Which obviously didn't vibe with a lot of women. I learned how to take my behavior down a notch from 'I'm better than you and I know it' to a more palatable 'I love myself and I know what I'm worth' that helped me understand how to get along with everyone better. Even outside of dating.

**My experience is still very anecdotal** like many others on dating. But, imo, you're already doing great. I'd say not to take being ghosted personally or see it as a failure. When you're ghosted, it's hardly ever for any rational or specific reason. I know I personally told plenty of women that I just wasn't feeling them and didn't want to meet. In hindsight, I didn't like dry convos because that would usually translate into an awkward date (which was about 80% of my 'let's not meet' decisions). The last 20% were women that just said something really sus or fixated too much on something specific about me (e.g. race, height, etc). But, I don't think I recognized that at the time, I just said no without a specific reason."	TunnelVizin845	reply	na	na	na	0.9994739890098572	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
"**WARNING: SI/ideation about death/terminal illness**

I've fucking had it. I feel wrecked. 

I've been suffering extreme stress at work for months on end, between my board of directors (I'm in an executive position) acting antagonistic toward me and my organization, and consistently not getting adequate backup from my organization in administrative matters, and actual organizational functions, while they cheerlead and bend over backwards to like...support my gender transition and be flexible about health issues. But their failures to deliver financial data on time, for example, exacerbate issues with the board, and cause me more stress that I'm sure is affecting my health. :/

And at home, I've been struggling with my spouse and some issues that are affecting our kid (and me) for *years,* and he's finally getting help and working on it, and we're working on it together, but I'm burnt to a crisp. And it's bringing up the hoarder house of garbage I've been shoving into mental and emotional closets to try and keep it together and keep things running, and be there for my kid. And my health issues are causing trauma for my spouse, so when I'm sick, I feel like I'm putting extra energy that I don't have into supporting him through the crisis of *me* being sick. And he doesn't really have a close support circle he can talk to, outside of crisis lines and therapists, and he's weird about reaching out to people anyway. But I am *burnt.*

And I recently got some testing processes for autoimmune disorders started, which has me feeling some type of way. I already felt like, ""Well damn, I better not get cancer, because I'll be driving myself to chemo after he's too distraught from our grief counseling sessions. And then who's going to take care of our kid?"" 

But I was having a real situation yesterday, which could have been an episode of bipolar rage, or PMDD, or a natural reaction to being stressed the fuck out. But I just woke up feeling like if anybody looked at me, talked to me, I was gonna flip a table and break down crying. And it lasted all day. And by dinner time, I felt like, if I hear my family speak one more time, not even to me, if they even say hello to each other, I'm gonna put my head through the sheetrock. 

So I went to the bathroom and stayed there for a minute. And started sorting my laundry behind a closed door. And I was just hit by this wave of hopelessness. And I was like, ""Fuck it. I hope the tests show something terminal. I hope I'm dying right now. Maybe I'd get to do something I actually want to do for a couple weeks, and then I'd be gone, and that would be it, and that would be better."" And I tried to interrogate that with, ""Well, your family needs you, your kid needs you,"" because that usually works, the thought of not leaving him behind, alone with his dad, but my mind was like, ""I can't. I just can't anymore. I can't deal with that. I want to go. I'm done. I'm out."" 

And I sat with it for a while, and I reminded myself that, ""Okay. When you think 'suicide' or 'death,' you're not really wanting to die, you're wanting a way out of something, to get to something else. What do you really want? *I don't really want to die, I want...?*"" And I don't really want to die. I want a vacation. I want a break from all this stress. I want a new job. I want my spouse to get his shit together. Maybe I want to live alone, in a much smaller space, where I can do things my way, in a way that makes sense to me, and I'm not drowning in other people's needs all the time, and I can breathe, and think, and it's not so goddamn noisy. 

I don't know. I'm not sure what I need. I'm definitely gonna talk to my therapist about it."	multirachael	post	29.385538044402892	female	White	0.9983373880386353	na	na	na	1	BlackMentalHealth

I went misdiagnosed for YEARS because all the questionnaires I filled out asked about ""being so happy you made poor decisions/got into trouble,"" and I was like, ""motherfucker, I am *never* happy!"" But I got *angry* all the damn time. Turns out my manic symptoms manifest as rage about 65% of the time.

And it's SO IMPORTANT to discuss environmental issues and controls as well as medication. Like, medication has been an absolute game-changer for me, I don't ever want to be without it. But life management is such a multiplier. Especially sleep. And ""get enough sleep"" isn't nearly as big a thing for me as ""create reliable sleep patterns."" And I think that can be more key for some people. 

You're not always gonna get that 8 hours (or whatever works for your body, because it varies from person to person). But going to bed around the same time every night, and getting up around the same time (even on the weekends, or whenever your days off fall), can really help stabilize your mood. 

Same with slowly building healthier eating habits, incorporating more physical movement, stuff like that. And for me, since I'm a creative person, finding a creative activity (even if it's not my main choice) that I can do for free, in little dribs and drabs and sprints, whenever, wherever, just for my own enjoyment and to flex my creative brain, has improved my mood TREMENDOUSLY. 

Additionally, stuff like meditation can look different for different folks. I can't do ""traditional"" forms of meditation, regardless of the flavor, because it tends to make me dissociate and go into a panic space. But if I open up a spreadsheet, even to just organize a list of books I've read, and move data around for 30 minutes, it lowers my heart rate and slows my breathing and brings me into a calmer space incredibly effectively. Some people also find this if they ""go clean something,"" for example. 

Those are just some insights I've developed, managing bipolar."	CreateWithMel	reply	na	na	na	0.0010758994612842798	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"I was heading into a severe depression due to quite a few factors and a friend came to visit and helped me organize. There is no shame in needing help. Zero.

I've been decluttering my home for going on... 3 years now? There was also a cross-country move in there as well (which really didn't/doesn't help) and it looks like we're probably moving again (hopefully) this summer. So I didn't get to completely unpack and am now trying to do it all over again. The ideal is that once I know where I'll be living for at least a couple of years I can open up the box of mementos that I really, really, want to get rid of but haven't had the spoons to deal with.

I could offer you resources to help organize your space, etc. but you have access to all of that. The main thing I see people--including myself initially--struggle with is constantly making impulse acquisitions. I won't even say buying needless shit because I don't do that--I grew up in abject poverty by US standards--I can't afford to be out here spending like that. We're also saving for a (small) house. 

So my issue is free/cheap used items. I rarely buy anything new if I can help it and while that's great from an envorinmental perspective, I didn't realize I had a problem initially. I was always grabbing free stuff that seemed useful and felt fine about it since I wasn't paying for it or buying it new. Over time that stuff piled up and since our last place was really small I didn't notice since most things were  either on a shelf or in my closet, etc. 

Once I figured that out, I took a long hard look at what my problem area was, what types of things I had a hard time passing up. So I started there. I focused on that one type of item (X) and got rid of the ones I hadn't used. I constantly had to remind myself that I could find (X) used if I absolutely needed them and once I got down to what I did want to keep/use the rule I made for myself is I can't bring a single X into the house if I don't get rid of two X first. I hope that makes sense.  Its worked so far but it is a struggle.

I've also been working on figuring out what my triggers for bringing stuff into the house are, usually its a project or something and at my old place I had a bunch of stuff for hobbies that I wanted to get into or enjoyed but... didn't have time to do. I was grabbing stuff for the person I wanted to be instead of the person I was in that moment. Now I have limited myself to 3 hobbies and that's it. If I want to try something new and can't for example, check it out from the library (our library has all kinds of stuff, guitars, digital drawing pads, a seed library, SAD Lamps...) then its not happening unless I want to give something else up and go through the process of selling my used items on craigslist, ebay, etc. and if nobody buys it then check with my local animal shelter, or a school or list it on freecycle, craigslist, or a non Goodwill thrift store as a last resort. I take broken electronics to Best Buy or somewhere that does e-recycling. I don't do a big purge and throw stuff away or take it to the thrift store initially because staying mindful of how much work it takes to get rid of the stuff helps me stop bringing it into the house to begin with.

Those things are things I can do now because the majority of my things were gone prior to the move, but it was a lot of work. It was a grind. I don't think that's reasonable for you right now, but I wanted to mention the 'not bringing stuff in in the first place' is something my friends--who are also hoarders--are stuck in that cycle. Always being frustrated with/overwhelmed by all of their stuff, constantly buying new shit they can not afford and DO not need, and viewing *wants* as *needs* when it comes to said items. They are not doing the work to get to the root of this cycle. It is tbh kind of a cultural thing here because there is a lot of intergenerational poverty and intergenerational trauma. 

That brings me to my last point - I don't do gifts. I haven't for a long time. If people want to get me something I tell them that I accept cake at any time of the year and leave it at that. I had to send out an e-mail post-move and ask people to a. stop sending me things and b. if they saw something that they felt I absolutely had to have (I don't) to ask me first, and don't take a 'no' personally. I explained that I'm still working to declutter post-move and I'd appreciate their support.

My oldest friend flipped out. It was wild as I'd never seen that side of her. To my credit, I held firm to my boundary instead of caving and thanked her for letting me know how she felt. I did tell her that I'd be happy to talk to her about my thoughts/feelings on receiving gifts at another time - she did not take me up on it.  Then a few weeks ago, she sent me something anyway and asked if I liked it - I told her I didn't know what I was supposed to do with it and grey rocked it so now... she's having a temper tantrum but honestly for the first time I feel confident in the belief that it is not my responsibility to manage her feelings. Its a small win, but I will take it!

A lot of the stuff I held on to (and the stuff I need to go through) are things that other people gave me that I don't want, don't need, don't like, and don't use. I kept those things because I felt like I *should* show gratitude and I see now how disordered that type of thinking is. Now I refer to those types of things as 'throw this away for me' items and, yeah. I'm committed to cutting out the middleman - me. I'm bringing this up because there may be people in your life who won't be able to support you in this--some of them may be the people who are threatening to send someone in--and I hope you aren't blindsided by it like I was. 

I hope some of that helps. I'd be happy to share resources but honestly subscribing to /r/declutter and having that in my feed plus the impending move was enough to keep me honest. I am also not being hard on myself. My tendency to hoard stuff is tied to my mental illness which was exacerbated by my upbringing and the stresses of living in a racist, etc. society. I ABSOLUTELY have a scarcity mindset and I don't feel ashamed because I've gone without and was raised by people who went without and so on and so forth. I realize this now and am working to address the impact of those circumstances while also recognizing that not only do I have enough, I am enough as I am. 


Its hilarious because in my working life I have to be really organized, but that is also a clue because while I struggle in some areas at work due to executive dysfunction/ADHD, etc. it really is a lot easier to detach emotionally from other people's stuff. Since there is no emotional attachment, I can organize objectively if I'm not stressed and experiencing a major depressive episode due to work stress.....

 Kind of like a substance addiction, hoarding is only a symptom of the issue.

Hey.. if your new insurance has a search like website or directory. You might be able to search by type of services and when you find that list of people. Most therapist and psychiatrist/ologist have a website. So if you google them(with the credentials lmft, psyD etc)they might have a site. Where you can learn more about what they do and their specialty.  As far as directory for black   psychiatrist I think there's directory on this page wiki. You can also Google black psychiatrist in your area. Finding out the insurance they take is the only work part. Also found some on psychology today. Com.

I would get the ball rolling. With three months off, you could use that time to see a therapist, or just get some much needed respite. It might end up being enough time, but you won't know until you've made the leap. You might find you want to return to work before the three months is up, but at least you will have given yourself more time to recover than just a couple of weeks here and there.

"I took 2 months off from my nonprofit exec job last year to do a partial hospitalization program (PHP), and it was a really good idea. 

It was an ""intensive mental health treatment"" that wasn't full lockdown. I'd drive myself there in the morning, do group DBT-based session work for most of the day with a lunch break and some snack breaks in there, and drive myself home in the afternoon. I'd get a short, individual check-in with a prescriber, and one with a therapist, weekly, to assess progress and discuss any safety concerns. I actually met some really cool people there, and learned a lot. Some of it I was like, ""Yeah, nah, that ain't for me."" And they were like, ""Yeah, that's fair. It's a big toolbox, use what works for you, adapt it how you need to, toss what doesn't serve you."" Which is a practical approach, I think.

As far as work, I didn't really tell them much. And you're not obligated to, outside of the minimum that HR is going to need to fill out FMLA paperwork, and you can work with a healthcare provider on that. I just basically told my supervisor, and our org president, ""I'm having increased issues from a chronic condition that I manage with medication, that will temporarily require a higher level of care."" And even that is more than you have to say. I felt comfortable saying that to them, and they were extremely supportive, and it gave us all some context to understand the kind of hand-off of duties and responsibilities needed for the planning *they* would need to do, to keep things running in my absence. 

But yeah. Short-term disability benefits, both times I've taken (once for post-birth leave, and then the above situation), have meant that I get 60% of salary coverage for the disability period, and the gap has to come out of PTO. So, if your PTO runs out before your disability period is over, your paycheck is gonna potentially be shrunk. But your HR office should be able to explain everything to you."

"White people will always do white people shit. Simple as that.

As a black man having been unfortunately being adopted into a white family I am just now starting to realize all of the damage they have done to me and how much being around ignorant white people has seriously impacted my self-esteem/self-image as well as completely ignored (or perhaps were too ignorant to care) several of the red flags like the suicidal ideation and social isolation before middle-school.

My father for example; he actually would go to the bathroom and take the smelliest shits you could imagine and since his bedroom's bathroom was right near the kitchen, he would sometimes play ""jokes"" on me and vent out all the smelly air into the kitchen while I was eating; then he'd come out and tell me: ""I just took a huge James"" (James being my name). I still don't know if it was out of malice or ignorance.

The term ""gotcha day"" as it relates to adoption needs to go too. Look it up. Think about it...just the name itself puts emphasize on the experience of the adopter versus adoptee. A ""gotcha"" for my adoptive parents is a whole bunch of ""lostya"" for **me**. My white adoptive mother would surprise hug me on our ""adoption anniversary"" and say those words: ""Gotcha"". It never sat right with me, but now it has an even more gloating tone the older I've gotten since she won't even help me with food and I'm basically dying.

They never wanted me anyways, they wanted to adopt an Asian but the adoption agencies basically tried haggling with my adoptive family once they figured out they were white and monied up, so they looked somewhere else and stumbled across me I guess. If you're going to adopt at least do your research. Don't have a home and now I'm constantly looking over my shoulder for those fucking pigs who also contributed to the deterioration of the last place I called home.

Some of the most frustrating memories were when my adoptive parents would willingly invite the police inside the house and lead them to my room without a warrant. This same police department has a history of not caring about black men (like most police departments) and have even shown up for ""wellness-checks"" on the basis that I was suicidal by cop and were still let inside...if that makes any sense.

There's so much I wish I could unpack but that's probably for a therapist. A **black** therapist. But I've had my bad luck with some of them too.

"I wasn't a transracial adoptee, but I was adopted by my great-grandparents (both now deceased) and as a result, I got a lot of shade from my peers and *their parents*!!! I'm still (at 46) unpacking a lot of the shame around some of the stuff that was said to/about me by friends' parents, members of the congregation, etc. It didn't help that my birth mom kept all of her other kids and I was sent back to live w/her--where I became a second parent and resident scapegoat--after my adoptive mom died. 

On the flip-side, one of the schools I worked for in a wealthy 'liberal' area had a lot of transracial adoptees. I didn't want that job and was only there for 3 years but I was the first Black employee and this was ten or so years ago. 

It was really weird interacting with the parents because they'd do things like have play dates for their kids with other adoptees from their region (if they knew where the child was from) but did everything they could to make sure their kids knew they were 'different' from Black folks born in the US. The wealthy immigrant communities they associated with held the same stereotypes, so it was gross. I felt bad for those kids because if they ever get pulled over and have to learn the hard way that racism here doesn't care where you're from I don't see things ending well for them. 

Regardless, I treated them with the kindness and care they--all children--deserved and worked to be a role model.

"The title makes it sound harsh but I promise it's not that intense.

Without going into great detail, my friends don't take anything serious. We're technically high school buddies that just kept in contact. It's wild because we're only a year apart in age at best. But, I was forced to grow up sooner than them. I was already on my own at 17 and I have been since then (I'm in my mid 20s now). I put myself through college (unfortunately, without much help from my family), started my career, got my own place, and have lived on my own ever since. Been through quite a bit and have had my fair share of weird things and struggles but it's mostly behind me now. I'm happy where I'm at in my life. I'm actively working on my career and hopefully settling down one day. However, though most of my friends have graduated college, they've never even lived on their own. None of them have ever had a full time job for more than a month or two and they all still largely rely on their parents to support them. Most of them graduated college and effectively chilled out for years taking odd jobs here and there when their parents make a fuss.

I love them but, damn, the distance feels like it continues to grow. It feels like we share less in common than ever before. Now it feels like the only thing we have in common are a few interests and a shared past. That's about it. It's enough to wonder why we're all friends from time to time. A few of them even seem kind of resentful that their titular ""poor black kid"" put their life together before they did and they've said a few backhanded comments that allude to it.

Today, they made a joke. I won't go into what the joke was but just know that it wasn't ok (nothing racial, just crude). I got over the joke mostly because it made me realize something.

I voiced how unacceptable the joke was and it mostly fell on deaf ears. Suddenly, after being the only person not ok with the joke, it made me realize that I'm surrounded by people that are still very immature, to be frank. They haven't grown up because they don't need to. To some extent, they actively refuse to grow up. I find myself in that position more often than ever and I'm tired of it. I'm tired of feeling like the 'parent' or the killjoy because I don't find the humor in *everything* anymore. I'm no longer an edgy 17 year old and there's some shit that just isn't funny anymore because me or someone close to me went through it or were affected by it. Even though I've already established this boundary on multiple occasions, it doesn't seem to matter.

I don't really know if I need *new friends* yet but I certainly need to spend much less time with my current set of friends if I even should continue being friends with them at all. They're lowkey toxic and childish and I'm done putting up with it just to have someone to talk to.

At this point, I'd rather be alone. It's hard because I've known them for the better part of a decade but shit happens, I guess.

This happen to anyone else? Ever had to distance yourself from your friends because yall don't mend anymore?"	Obtainable20	post	22.157014946250076	male	White	0.9896636605262756	na	na	na	3	BlackMentalHealth
"Sometimes you have to leave those old friends behind. I'm 24 and I did that just last year. The ringleader and my ex best friend (25f) of my former group of friends was toxic. She just never got over high school. She judged our former classmates and always updated me on what they were doing. She always told me about old high school drama that I never cared about. When I started to tell her I didn't care about that stuff, then her feelings would get hurt and I had to baby her (I wasn't being mean, she just took me not being interested in that stuff as me not caring about her). I then found myself walking on eggshells for her all the time. The other friends in the group also were stuck in their high school ways too and found no issue with the ringleader's antics. 

The other friends in the group just had no work ethic, little ambition, and relied on their parents for everything. They all just accepted what the ring leader told them, always followed her and were just a hivemind. It was even worse when it came to mental health because they thought being broken was like a badge of honor. It just got hard to connect with them, especially when I was trying to better myself. Eventually, I had a small argument where I got told not to talk to them for a while so I just distanced myself from them. A few months later, the ex best friend started to send me messages asking why I was not talking to them. I ignored them because I knew she would launch into an argument and I never felt like dealing with that. Later she escalated to attacking my bf and blamed him for my silence, so I decided to officially end things. It was a simple paragraph of a text message where I just explained that it was hard to hang out with her but that I wouldn't mind being friends again when she matures a bit more. I also apologized for months of silence as I really didn't know how to talk to her again.... Well, she responded by calling me names, then messaged my bf to call him names too. We blocked her, her bf, and the ex friend group.

I do have moments where I'm lonely, but its mainly due to my situation. I like in person interaction and it's been hard to interact with my college friends due to COVID and graduation. Now that I graduated, am working remotely, and live far away from them, it's really hard to hang out with friends like I used to. I also have trouble texting or calling people, so I just have a hard time keeping up with them. That said, it's also difficult for me to make friends online too. 
In my mental downturns, I feel like it was a mistake to end the friendships, since we had several group chats where they kept constant contact with me. We also gamed a lot, so I do miss having friends to play online games with. However, in my moment of mental clarity I realize that it was for the better because it was just agonizing to my mental health in the long run."

"I did this slowly over the years. Once I feel the disconnect, I slowly stop hanging out, responding, etc. if someone asks, I let them know that I just don't feel that we're on the same page.

You deserve friends who love and support you and also have the same values as you. It's okay if some things differ, but things that are a big deal to you should be treated as such. Good luck OP!

"I've come to a similar realization over the last year or so and I'm in my mid forties. I don't have a lot of friends, there are only about 3 of them. I've been trying to manage the friendships and communicate because truth be told I *am* the one who's changed. I'm working on developing boundaries and my oldest friend sees it as 'putting up walls' rather than me telling her what I want/need from her and what I can realistically offer. 

She's currently 'not talking to me' and its honestly a relief to let her work out her own feelings after I established a boundary, she broke it, and I didn't backpedal due to her percieved 'exception' to my boundary. When I established said boundary I also said, 'if you're uncertain, ask first and I hope you won't take a potential 'no' personally.'

I have my own feelings to manage with limited time and spoons so... yeah."	Obtainable20	reply	na	na	na	0.9896636605262756	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
"Since I've learned about the term ""soft life"", I've fully immersed myself in learning how to reconnect with my Divine Feminine. 

As a woman of color from the Caribbean, LIFE can make you become harsh, callous, and bitter.

However, by embracing the soft life, I've learned to reject the struggle, stress, and grinding mentality to become more graceful, delicate, and oh-so-sweet.

Nobody cares. And when I express my emotions I‚Äôm wrong! But a white woman can express however she feels and she gets support. I say I‚Äôm suicidal. I get told to shut up and stop breaking character. But a white woman can do this shit and get support. My mom basically told me not to stay in her house if I had mental health issues and check in a hospital. I got laughed at from my dad and brother for going to therapy!

"Your family is very toxic and dismissive when it comes to mental health it seems. The best thing you could do is leave, but If you can't do that you need to find different outlets, different people that will listen to your issues.

Keep in mind that at least in my opinion, mental health is not something that is talked about very much in the black community up until the last 15 years, and it's major boom came probably sometime around 2015. 

Even with this newfound exposure, it's still somewhat of a taboo subject that's treated as ""white people shit"" it's not something that is as commonplace and widespread and openly expressed like it is amongst white people so there's bound to be more ridicule and less acceptance.

For yourself and your own health, try to focus on yourself and if you have to, ignore your family. I wouldn't want to deal with a family that ridicules me for trying to get better. I'm very sorry that you're experiencing this from your own family, but there's a community here that will help you, and offer advice if you ask us to."	crazygurl3	reply	na	na	na	0.9911215305328369	no	no	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
"Your family =/=the black community. As someone with really intense mental health issues, psychosis, personality, dissociative disorders because of insanely abusive parents I had to learn this the hard way. Growing up because of what I went through and nobody really noticed, I saw my father in every black man. I saw my mother in every black woman. And I was filled with hate and rage. Not only that but I was in a neighborhood where I saw a ton of crime. It wasn‚Äôt until I was taken in by adoptive family, 3 black parents, that I unlearned the behavior and hostile things I was taught. 

I said all this to say that although mental health is an issue that isn‚Äôt seen as important in the black community there are people who care and people willing to listen that are black. Sometimes you get placed in a safer space and sometimes you have to find it. What you go through isn‚Äôt indicative of the whole community. But it does hurt to not be listened to, to feel alone, to feel invalidated‚Ä¶ check and see if your school has resources. If not the school look of community groups. Churches. Cultural centers. I have a nephew going group to therapy in the basement of a park district building. There can be options for you, some are free. If you really feel like things are bad you can take yourself to the hospital. Some hospital can offer resources for rehousing.

"I think about suicide a lot, too. When it's over, it's over, then you don't gotta worry about nothing. Thing is... nothing is over. You still bot blood in your veins and breath in your lungs. There are three things I want you to think about when those suicidal thoughts occur.

The first is that things change. Whether or not it gets better doesn't matter. What's important is that whatever we suffer, it will change. Life will never run out of new problems to give us. You're family sounds like trash, to be honest. But there may come a time, especially if you take care of yourself, where you don't have to worry about your family anymore. Think about a future where things have changed.

Second thing I want you to think about: What you want to do. When I think about the things I want to do, they're pretty simple. I want to eat, masturbate, and watch cartoons. These are indulgences and I want you to think about what you indulge in. Life is meant to have pleasures and we find those pleasures where we can. While the trick is to not be consumed by those pleasures, it's better to be consumed by pleasure than overcome with suicide.

Finally, I want you to think about what you need to do. I don't believe people are born with special purpose in life. I don't believe any of us have any destiny. But I do believe that we can make our own purpose in life. We can assign ourselves obligations. I want you to think about all the things you need to do before you die. My obligation, what keeps me on this Earth, is I've told myself I have a story to write and I can't kill myself until it's finished. Maybe you have a story inside of you, or maybe you have your own objective. I just ask that you have one.

With that said, please stick with therapy. I'm in therapy too and if nothing else it's nice to have a place to be one day out of the week."	crazygurl3	reply	na	na	na	0.9911215305328369	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"A lot of people are saying it's your family and not the community. I honestly disagree, especially as a black woman. We're told to be strong, suck it up, don't cry, etc. We're not allowed to be soft.

Any time I need help or a shoulder, I'm told ""You're so strong you got this!"" but a white woman could literally break a nail and they're all over her. Soothing and comforting her. 

This isn't something that's in your head this is our community and there's tons of think pieces about it."	crazygurl3	reply	na	na	na	0.9911215305328369	weak	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
Your feelings are extremely valid. I agree with what many others in this thread have said. Your family is a part of the black community for sure but they do not speak for or represent all black people. There are many black people who are capable of extending compassion to you.

"Mental illness is still a stigma!  White Americans people seem not to stigmatize it as much as black, some people of color and immigrants.  I think this stems from racism and the whole white female tears phenomena.  Historically we hide stuff because white people will use it against us like every thing else.  They don‚Äôt see our pain and gaslight us historically and even still for many.  I am realizing this more sense I moved to the South.  Also, as a Christian our religion can be an obstacle too.  There is stigma related to how religion can interpret mental illness and I have tried to address it in my own life as well as with church leaders/folks.  

I think as black Americans we are getting better about this. At least my family has with more education.  

My family is blended African American and Nigerian.  I do see what you have referred in reaction to my own and my daughters‚Äô mental health.  My husband has changed, although very slowly, about how he views this.

I took my daughter to a psychiatrist and on meds against his wishes.  However, I‚Äôve taken meds myself for decades.  He encouraged me to take meds but not my daughter.  

I also notice a lot of the psychiatrist and mental health people are Nigerian, and East Indian.  One Nigerian mental health provider who is also a pastor basically told me there is a lot of stupidity in the culture when it comes to mental health.

I say, Do what you have to do to be and stay healthy mentally.  If your mom is willing to come to some family Therapy sessions that can help a lof.  Have you tried family therapy with any members ?

That‚Äôs what we needed to do with my husband and he is viewing mental illness with less stigma.  Although, he sometimes still has trouble understanding things fully.  I have to remember that he has come a long way over the years. He now is in full support of my daughter getting any treatment that can help her!  

I‚Äôve even managed to get my husband to attend marriage counseling‚Ä¶This took decades to do.  Ironically, the church we attend now is big into encouraging marriage Therapy and the pastor openly shares that it helped his own marriage!

Things are changing!  Surround yourself with a support group!  NAMI (National Alliance for Mentally Ill) is a good place to start.  

By the way, if you got to check into a hospital or attend PHP to get help, then do so.  I‚Äôve been in them about 20 times and that probably is why my husband can‚Äôt deny things.  But of course if you don‚Äôt need to then maybe move or avoid talking to her since she makes things worse. 
Hope you find your tribe/support

The past two years have been pure hell. I‚Äôve been in and out of a mental health hospital. I‚Äôm a veteran and last year I was forcibly kicked out of the military due to my refusal of the vaccine. I have my reasons for refusing that I don‚Äôt want to get into here on Reddit. So yes I‚Äôm one of the 8,400 service members that were separated due to the vaccine. I was struggling mentally and well my entire unit ostracized me and treated me like crap. When I tried to express that I felt that they saw me as a failure they gas-lit me and stated things like ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre a bad soldier‚Äù all while on the administrative side they were creating a negative packet against me to get me kicked out. Well they finally had a reason to kick me out and they did over the vaccine mandate. I am currently jobless been out of the Army for nearly two months. I can‚Äôt get unemployment to at least hold me over until I can get another job due to the nature in which I was discharged all because of this dam mandate. I worked for 6 dam years I earned that!! I‚Äôm just left with so much anger and bitterness. I gave 6 years of my life to this dam organization and I‚Äôm just tossed out like a piece of garbage. It‚Äôs like these last 6 years were wasted. I deployed and it‚Äôs like it doesn‚Äôt even matter. Just because I was struggling these last two years. I tried I really did. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I can‚Äôt keep going like this though I just can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just too hard to handle all of this right now.

"A lot lately,

I'm at this age where I ponder about being more than the best version of myself. And I wonder if there's an upper level of just being the ultimate version of yourself instead of being the best version of yourself.

When people say be the best version of yourself, for some reason, I can't really be content with that. It's like I have to do more and I have to be more. Not just for myself but for everyone else.

Though I know it is a human being and an individual the whole point of being the best version of yourself is to be the best you can be authentically.

For some odd reason, I don't want to be the best version of myself. I want to be the most ultimate version of myself.

The version that can handle any challenge or be optimistic about opportunities and give people the support they need.

I guess I would consider myself to have the Superman effect.

But do you think something is wrong with being the ultimate version of yourself and not being content with the best version of myself?"	MISTAX1995	post	16.610486446087222	male	White	0.002791239880025387	na	na	na	2	BlackMentalHealth
"I'm of two minds about it. 

On the one hand, there's the idea that comes to me of like...""training levels"" and kind of ""evolving up."" I'm on a Dragon Ball Z kick right now, and maybe it's a stupid metaphor, but that's what comes to mind. You train really hard, you face a tough challenge, you unlock new powers, you kick some ass, and now you've got a whole new form. And then, next season, or a couple episodes down the line, you do it again. You keep going higher, because there's always gonna be something. And maybe there's joy in the challenge of seeing just how strong you can get, how far you can go (if you're a Goku type).

On the other hand, in the real world, there's an all-too-real pressure and obsession with hustle, chasing the impossible to infinity, and burnout happens to the point of taking years off our lives. Decades, even. And especially if you're doing the most, and then pushing past that, to tend to the needs of others, you're gonna run out of gas super fast. It happens in the caring professions all the time--nurses, social workers, teachers, etc. It's a huge problem.

It's something I have struggled a lot with, personally. When people smiled and patted me on the shoulder and said, ""Just do your best,"" it was practically a death sentence. I'm a chronic high achiever with a LOOOOOOOOOTTTT of talent and skill and drive and dedication. My ""best"" is ASTRONOMICAL. My 50-60% is a normal person's 110%. My 100% is completely unsustainable. 

So I had to learn about *sustainability.* Maybe I can achieve massive feats. But can I keep something going, steady and reliable, over a long span of time? Can I do multiple marathons in a couple years, instead of a single track meet where I run every event? 

The best version of myself, right now, knows peace and contentment. Knows how to slow down, and take in small moments, and experience joy and wonder in the mundane. The best version of myself is learning how to say no to things, and prioritize taking time for things that bring me joy and make me feel authentic in my self-concept. And I think I'll probably never reach an ""ultimate"" version, because I'll still be growing and changing and mid-process until the day I die.

"Yeah, and it sucks. It's an awful way to go through life. And the thing is, it means that you have to be that much more responsible for yourself.

If nobody is going to listen to you, then you have to work extra hard to be the one who listens to yourself. To be the one who validates you. And yes, it means you have to be the one who helps yourself.

I wish I had a better answer. You're already in therapy, so you got that going for you.

Ppl of certain backgrounds. White people and men. I understand why they do it. It's bc they're privileged but as a Black woman it's one of those things I don't do.

It's annoying bc I speak for myself but I can't even do that without it being a fucking issue. I can't even make an observation or find scientific shit without ppl gaslighting me and saying I'm wrong or it's something else. It's the most annoying shit ever. I'm gonna go all through life constantly being invalidated about everything and when I simply tell someone not to invalidate others it's going to be made out to be a big fucking deal bc they're likely going to be entitled asf. And its especially going to be a big fucking deal bc I'm a Black woman. And that's going to continue to send me up a wall.

"First of all thanks for being open enough to share this‚Ä¶ Next, my response in no way os meant to invalidate your truths, experiences, and understanding. You post to me and my experiences and studies of people and life is disheartening. Mainly because as a BM who knows the importance and value of a BW and togetherness. 

We of the awakened kind don‚Äôt like or need to be bottled in with white ppl/men unless we ask for it. White ppl led Politics and Religion made sure that we would be subservient, fearful, and integrated as a race. Then individuals helped do it as a ethnicity. Simply put we have been taught and accepted to be Us vs. Us as a ppl. I have no privilege outside of being black and have been through more crap than a little bit. Mainly because I‚Äôve been on a journey to embrace all my layers of self. Not easily persuaded and to conform as an adult. That‚Äôs why healing and true openness mentally and spiritually is important. That way we can love ourselves better and as a community. So the best fit person can be placed where they belong in our lives and allow them to do the same. Let‚Äôs continue to learn that this isn‚Äôt a one-size fits all or cookie-cutter life we live.

So my car was broken into today at my job (FeDex -don‚Äôt work here!!!) and my wallet was stolen thank god my phone was still in my car.

This is something I experience(d) a lot and I used to take it to heart when I was younger but now I'm to the point where I don't have the patience for it. People will typically take the path of least resistance and instead of saying 'man, that's terrible' - because it is - the typical response is given in hindsight after the fact as a way to shirk the underlying issues.

Like, let's talk about how people shouldn't steal from other individuals. Maybe throw some shade to an insanely profitable (for shareholders/ceos, etc.) business that doesn't allow employees to carry personal items, but skimps on reliable methods to secure the items. Or I don't know, a lack of affordable education options which prevents a large portion of the population from acquiring skills.

"We be having a lot of small black subreddits and most of them don't even average 50k people let alone a million or some. It really shows how limited the black side of reddit is especially when we aren't together. We have a subreddit for black men, a subreddit for black mental health, 2 subreddits for black women, a subreddit for black history and black history pictures, but most of them only average a few thousand people if that. You have a lot of people on BPT (over a million) but let's be real; I'm pretty sure a lot of those members aren't actually black and it isn't a subreddit dedicated to just kickin the shit and talking about black issues. You have some hood/ghetto subreddits like Chiraqology, Calibanging, NYStateOfMind but I'm pretty sure a lot of those members aren't actually black and are just fascinated with our culture. I know there's a lot of black people in those subreddits but it isn't a main black subreddit to talk about black issues or just connect with each other, they're niche subreddits for rap and the hood culture in general. Which is coo cuz I'm from the hood so I spend time in those subreddits but it's still niche to the topic at hand. You can't really start a random conversation about black things there. 

Yeah there isn't a lot of racially specific subreddits on Reddit in itself and in a way that's good but in reality there isn't anything wrong with it if it were to happen. Black people are a small minority on Reddit so it would make sense to bring us all together collectively to just discuss us, our history, our future, our people, our culture, our background, just a safe place for black people (and lightskin people who are at least 50% black and was raised around black people) to come together since we don't seem to have any real support system for us. When the majority of reddit is based around white things (white history, white culture, white jokes, white puns, white backgrounds, everyone sharing their white experiences), us black people get outted a lot for sharing ours. Yeah you might see a black person doing something cool in the 'interesting' subreddits, or you might see a black person doing something on 'facepalm' or 'public freakout' (half the time people do it racially motivated to send shots at us), and sometimes you see something black related in the history subreddits, but the majority of the time it's something white culture related because that's the majority on here and that's what that want to see. Unless a black person is doing something ghetto for them to make fun of or is doing something 'interesting' (because we aren't accepted like that UNLESS we're doing something 'entertaining'), you don't really see our shit being posted around. 

I've seen black people banned from reddit for saying 'nigga' because the admins assume everyone on Reddit is white and says nigga racially, without comprehending or caring there's actually different cultures and backgrounds on here. Which is racist in itself. Admins racially assuming everyone is white, then bans someone for 'racism' without comprehending they're literally being racist themselves. A lot of fake ass PC bs. You aren't even allowed to say nigga in some subreddits because of the rampant racism (the word is flagged and automatically deletes the post). 

So yeah us black people, people of color, etc, don't really have a lot of ACTIVE and POPULATED communities we could just talk and be ourselves with. We always have to tone shit down to appease to the white demographic on here."		post	9.778444921050271	male	White	0.9972947239875793	na	na	na	7	BlackMentalHealth

First off I wanna say that I‚Äôm not making this post to share a sob story. I‚Äôm writing this, because I‚Äôm struggling with this a lot lately. I need some advice. Maybe someone here can give me some insight. I‚Äôve struggled most of my life and had to bust my ass for everything I‚Äôve acquired in life. I‚Äôve poured so much effort into my jobs just to have NO ONE acknowledge it. I watched as others progress and get promotions while I‚Äôm just completely ignored and overlooked. I figured instead of feeling sorry for myself I‚Äôll just work harder and try not to worry about others. That maybe my efforts will be noticed in time. However I believe I‚Äôve reached my limit. I‚Äôm exhausted. I‚Äôm about to be 35 in another month and I feel like I‚Äôm in the same place I was when I first started working and living on my own‚Ä¶14 years ago. I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point.	Redditerderrrr	post	21.991964795488624	female	White	0.9966661334037781	na	na	na	2	BlackMentalHealth
"> I‚Äôve poured so much effort into my jobs just to have NO ONE acknowledge it...That maybe my efforts will be noticed in time.

My father gave me this advice after I got my first job. ""The interview ends when you leave."" The same way you'd conduct yourself in the interview is generally how you should maintain yourself. Even if not in cadence, but in how you highlight your efforts and achievements. How you speak about yourself should never change. How you carry yourself when you have opportunities to prove your aptitude and knowledge. Ultimately, you are in charge of acknowledging your effort. It's a strenuous duty especially for someone reserved and not a braggart. I can personally attest to it as well. However, work is hardly the time to be humble. I strongly suggest you leave that mentality behind. Make sure they know how hard you worked. Put yourself out there. I promise you that you won't regret it. Donning this mentality changed a lot for me in life and I really hope you find the same success."	Redditerderrrr	reply	na	na	na	0.9966661334037781	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
"A lot came to mind and I feel like I'm starting to ramble as I keep adding and deleting, so I'll leave it at this:

1. Have you looked into moving to another company? Does the current company have multiple locations and transfers are available? Are you willing to move? It sounds like it's time for a change or to try a different field by applying transferable skills. I know it's easier said than done. But, for the sake of your self-esteem (constantly chasing moving goal posts and being told you're falling short is going to do some damage) and mental health, it's worth a try. Look for the same position(s) you're looking to get promoted to, so you're hired directly to the spot instead of making a lateral move and still fighting for the promotion. 

1a. Some advice given to me recently was to just build out a full LinkedIn profile to put yourself out there and see who hits you up. You might be surprised. I'm Air Force, and my job in the private sector is easily a 6-figure deal. I know someone who put in their transferable skills plus their degree they're finishing (that's not their current career field); they're planning on separating from the Air Force as a result.

2. Far as entrepreneurship, make sure you know what goes into it for taxes, business loans, your chosen entity type (LLC, S-Corp, C-Corp), etc. Be prepared to work long hours and build and use a lot of networking to get it off the ground. You should probably check your savings to see if you can do bare-basic living while you focus on the business, or maybe try to keep this or some job at the same time."

* If you are emotionally unstable and by extension so is your child ‚Äî then again, going silent might be unhelpful ‚Äî however your communication with your adult child may be better managed with a third-party counselor rather than going direct.

"Here is goes- my 34 yr old daughter has kidney failure and she recently started dialysis. I have been with her every step of the way. Caring for her and her dog.

Btw- we‚Äôre roommates 

Well she had a surgical procedure. And after about a week I encouraged her to walk, drink water and take her stool softeners.
She told me no.

But when she got to her doctors office, the nurse said the same thing almost in that order. I was sitting in the corner of the office and rolled my eyes and said hmm.

She called me stupid and weird for suggesting she walk her own dog. Because she is in pain. 
Right in front of the medical staff.

I‚Äôm so hurt, by her I haven‚Äôt spoken to her in three days. 
Ok so if you didn‚Äôt want to do the full walk, you can walk some.üò≥ 
Her father is deceased and I‚Äôve been there with her through it all. But I refuse to be spoken to any kind of way.
I miss our times together, and I love being a support person.
But damn I love me also and this is triggering my depression and isolation.
Any suggestions ?"	Square-Theory9677	post	41.62812801381547	female	White	0.9992607235908508	na	na	na	5	BlackMentalHealth
"It sounds like you are the only person she has so she takes her frustration and whatever else out on you. Don‚Äôt be childish and not talk to her. That doesn‚Äôt resolve anything. Tell her she isn‚Äôt to speak to you that way. Speak up when something bothers you. No one cares about you being silent, it just ends up eating you up inside and it‚Äôs a very immature way to deal with conflict.

You don‚Äôt deserve disrespect from anyone especially your kids that you do everything for.

  I feel like I‚Äôm crumpling. I‚Äôve been trying to be nicer to myself, in more ways than one, and I‚Äôve noticed it helped. I tried especially hard to give myself a break yesterday.

I was suppose to get some of my needs, like in Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy of needs, met‚Ä¶ maybe then I could focus more, and worry less.

"If you live in the states the economy has started to take a major nose dive. Unemployment is at an all time high right now.

Hell‚Ä¶I‚Äôm unemployed! -Ha! üòÇ You stated that you‚Äôve been trying to be nicer to yourself I think that‚Äôs a good thing! The biggest struggle with that is staying consistent especially if you‚Äôre in the habit of ruminating and being hyper critical of your self. Self love is something that is actually learned believe it or not. So we have to take the time to practice that regularly until it is an almost instinctive act.

"Yes. Dealing with it nowadays. Something is up, but my various care team aren't 100% sure what, and there are some limiting factors that make it so I don't have a *wide* array of options, but we're working on it. 

In the three to four days before I get my period now, I get so, so angry and depressed. Almost like a bipolar mixed episode. All I want to do is sleep, eat, and yell at my family. I feel full-blown malice for all mankind. I desire to be mean to people for no reason. And then my period hits, and I start to feel less angry, but I feel physical fatigue like I ain't had since I had mono. That ""I might need to shower sitting down"" fatigue. That ""I gotta grab a snack and a bottled water at Target, because getting two items at this store sapped me of the energy I needed to drive home"" fatigue. 

And that's not who I am. That's not how I am, even when my meds are kinda off. 

But my IUD is supposed to be treating that. Yet my skin is looking a damn mess, and has been since my period decided to start coming every 2 weeks all of a sudden, so I think something hormonal is up. 

I can't take hormonal birth control pills or shots or whatever, and I'm working toward starting testosterone HRT. But my OB/GYN is working on getting me some meds to block my estrogen and stop my period until I can yeet my freakin' uterus.

I really haven't enjoyed life since I was a kid. It really sucks being 30 years old and really having no real lived experience. I really have absolutely no wins in life.. I can't even look back on the past and think about a time  that was good other than maybe my immediate childhood/ everything before 10 or 12. I have pretty much nothing going for me.. and being 30 with nothing going for you makes it difficult to get a life. I have no real fond youthful experiences to look back on and it's so heartbreaking. It doesn't matter if it's people I talk to in real life or individuals I see online / social media.. the vast majority of people have lived life and had many experiences I haven't. There's really no way around the fact that the way my parents chose to raise me has stifled me and will probably impact me in this way throughout the rest of my life.

I‚Äôm sorry that you‚Äôre unhappy. You are correct that you have been affected by your parents‚Äô choices, but there are reasons to be hopeful. You are an adult and now have control over your reality, today.

"As someone who grew up autistic and had a dysfunctional home life, especially in adolescence I have felt this hard. High school graduation was a bleak time for me hearing others get extra cheers from their friends and give speeches as they walked the stage, because I couldn't properly socialize with folks till hitting my 20s. I still have never had a girlfriend or been kissed, and I still envy friends or colleagues who had more chill families, as opposed to mine riddled with fighting and mental health issues. With college I am basically starting at scratch doing online courses so the conventional 4 year experience I missed out on too. Plus as mentioned in the past being a 6'2 black guy society definitely makes me feel like I should have been the big man on campus athlete vs the socially inept homebody I turned out to be(plus that is what my dad was, and my mom was similar).

It has gotten a bit better. I no longer beat myself up over not following the checklist of being a teenager(dating/sex, sneaking out and mischief,etc), though I do wish I participated in some activities and events and had a low key but decent social life. As for college, thing is lots of my graduating class(including those who were athletes/in extracurriculars and had good grades) went to the local junior college. I actually met one girl who just graduated and had commuted from home even when she transferred to uni. As far as relationships go, I know dating as a teen can be a learning experience but not without petty drama and so I imagine not doing so isn't the end of the world especially since college/post HS is when relationships can become substantial anyway(still missing that though).

And honestly it would have made sense to do so in hindsight due to it not being cost effective (I live just 30 minutes from a good state university) but also back when I left home for a bit due to family drama, I tried living in student apartments(not a student, but since they weren't dorms it wasn't required)...and I didn't like it. Like the conditions were fine but the loud music and partying noises wasn't my thing. Yet I remember really so envious of the notion of getting accepted to your dream school and experiencing freedom, etc.

What about the rest of you guys?"	Zen-Paladin	post	19.15237732103684	male	White	0.9870933890342712	na	na	na	1	BlackMentalHealth
"Honestly, I'd be willing to bet that a lot of your experiences are shared by the majority of people around you. Not everyone is the class President or Mr. Popular; those folks are superlatives, and certainly not the norm. I'm willing to bet most people didn't get a ton of cheers outside their family, or didn't give speeches at graduation. 

I'm a firm believer that there are seasons in life: being a young adult is a great time to take risks, like going off to your dream college in another state, but those risks sometimes don't work out. I myself went to a local school and transferred to the state university, and for a long time I had felt like I missed out on freshman shenanigans; I didn't have a clique, I was just kind of floating around. However, coming to campus a little more seasoned allowed me to dodge pitfalls I had seen others fall into. So many of those Class Presidents and Mr. Populars wash out without their parents guiding them. So, ultimately, looking back, my path helped me grow up a bit more, save money, and then pursue my studies and ultimately graduate. 

Sometimes, you only grasp the season you're in when it's halfway through, and then you wonder if you wasted it because of what other folks are doing, but you can't think like that. I think our own predispositions align us either to the season of youth, the season of adulthood, or the season of wisdom because at all those times you need to utilize different skills to make the most out of the season.

In simple terms I don‚Äôt know here I fit anymore, in a more detailed way. I am born African and yes I am aware African American tend not to like Africans and Africans tend to have a demeaning view on African Americans, and this is where my issue begins. I don‚Äôt subscribe to all that the African says, yet at the same time I also don‚Äôt subscribe to all the African American says. I‚Äôve realized both sides have had been psychologically manipulated by the the colonization and presents that some but not all have become hypnotized. I don‚Äôt completely fit the stereotype of the African and I don‚Äôt fit the stereotype of the American African. I simply try and do everyday what I can to make myself happy yet that leaves me as a lone wolf, between the two. Work, house, occasionally going out is my life for the past 4 years and yes being single is my own fault because I am picky with who I allow into my life. It would be great to have local friends which whom to spend time with on not simple drink all the time, or party, but actually make plans with, and actually be on time and stick to the schedule. I don‚Äôt understand the whole thing about being late. It‚Äôs be nice not to have to constantly give people a false start time just so that they will show up on time. Anyways this is just a bit of my frustrations in life and simple doing my best to find a safe heaven to pass the rest of my life in bliss just like our ancestors did in the past before civilization arrived and made everything twice or infinitely difficult to simple exist on this planet		post	34.27238754781875	female	White	0.0049947528168559074	na	na	na	2	BlackMentalHealth

I feel your pain. I am a Southern black woman who struggles with the blatant disrespect from associates who do not respect my time. I am an introvert to my core with anxiety and depression, so if we make plans and you are late I am usually already over whatever we planned to do. My circle is diverse and I find it hard to just say its a black thang, but it is an irritating thang. So I understand. However, my true friends understand that my mental health is dependent on me being able to socialize without stressing about them being on time. Don't give up, your on-time people are looking for you too. #blissup		reply	na	na	na	0.0049947528168559074	weak	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"Because there is no real ""archetypical black"" to become. People set up these ideas of what we're supposed to be, we fail to become the person we are.

It's like... fighter pilot cockpits. A long time ago the American Air Force wanted to save money by making standard sized cockpits. So they took measurements of all the pilots and averaged out the numbers to create a cockpit. When put into practice it was a failure. Not a single pilot found the cockpit comfortable, and comfort is important in combat situations. The solution? Adjustable seats. Just like what's used in modern cars.

Likewise... whatever it means to ""be black,"" consider adjusting blackness to your comfort."	Efficient_Art937	reply	na	na	na	0.00894366204738617	no	no	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

I think you may have identity issues. As a Black woman that deals with that, it's hard for me to actually relate to a lot of ppl. Unless, I'm molding myself to something I think they may like. And I get wym bc I see so many strong, smart, Independent, Black women that come from tough situations. And I come from a tough situation(home life and school) but I don't relate bc I feel I don't amount to the other Black women. Nor am I an overachiever like a lot of them. I'm kinda just here.

I feel like I see so much talk about racism and antiblackness. And convos on mental health in the Black community and how we need to do better with it(which is true). BUT rarely do I see convos on racial trauma and the lasting effects it has on our mental health. For example, I could be very distrusting of white people because of what I've experienced. I'm already sensitive but something a white person says or even nonblack/ambiguous person says will be taken completely different by me. I've looked back on times I've completely flashed out on nonblack ppl bc I misread what they were saying. But it's because of my experiences with them hasn't been the best. I immediately think they're out to get me or have something against me bc I'm a Black woman, or that they're being condescending.

Hi. I agree and I wish I knew why we don‚Äôt talk about racial trauma on these forums.  I think one reason is because racial trauma is exhausting and talking about it can retraumatize some people.  We as Black people are ‚Äúon guard‚Äù as it is and we sometimes don‚Äôt like to go to that place that could affect our mental health negatively.  I think most Black people have this feeling of distrust for non-Black people (especially white) deep down inside. Look, we have good reasons to be distrustful of them tbh.  I had bad anxiety around ‚Äúthem‚Äùwhen the George Floyd murder happened and then all of the fallout directly afterwards tbh.  Reading racist negative comments online in 2020 definitely made me angry anxious and depressed all at once (was on Lexapro for six months).   Then I had some acceptance about things.  One big thing I accepted is that many of them (non-Black people) will always think negatively about us (no matter what good deeds, how many college degrees, etc) so just move about life as I was doing before 2020.  Another thing, is that I remember to not lump them all in as being potential racists out to do me in.  But seriously, there will *always* be racist microagressions, I just pick and choose what to loose my shyt about.  I will always call out overt racism though.

Oh my God I totally understand where you‚Äôre coming from as far as dealing with Racial trauma, I to feel the same way when I am around white people I feel that they don‚Äôt have my best interest at heart that they‚Äôre out to get me pre-judging me because I‚Äôm black or any comment that they may make towards me may be taken out of contacts because I feel that they are judging me in a negative way with that being said, I do wish that this was talking about more and it‚Äôs to the point now where it affects not just my personal life but also my professional work as well it‚Äôs really hard for me to be around them granted I too am a bit sensitive and also kind of an introspective person so that also makes it a little hard for people to understand me or hard for people to get to know me. I generally keep people at a distance, especially if they‚Äôre white, I‚Äôve noticed I don‚Äôt feel comfortable with them and I‚Äôm always very guarded. I do wish that this is something that was talked about. I do wish there were something that I could do about it and a lot of the times I do wish that I could sit and talk with a white person and have them understand exactly what I go through when they look at me when they talk to me when they see me but I want you to know that what you just said really resonated with me today because I feel the exact same way you do	Lexonfiyah	reply	na	na	na	0.9909552931785583	weak	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
I don‚Äôt know if this will help, but I think talking about it amongst us whether it be here whether it‚Äôs with your friends and people that understand I think it might be better because just getting it out in the open would help us all to understand what we need to do to navigate this and how to deal with it so if you need to talk with anyone, I will gladly talk with you about this and also being a black man i totally get it. I mean I hate to say it but it‚Äôs to the point now where I don‚Äôt even really believe anything good that a white person will say towards me and this isn‚Äôt a sound negative, but this is something that is real and it‚Äôs definitely something that I feel like needs to be talked about because one thing I think about is how this affects younger kids that are also black	Lexonfiyah	reply	na	na	na	0.9909552931785583	no	no	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"Everyone talks about the physical damage to being fat..... but no one talks about the mental damage.

I've been fat all my life. I was bullied for being fat as a child and all the mean shit said to me has stuck with me and I can't really let it go or get over it. I obsessively think about how much I hate my body. I know that my weight has held me back because it stop me from engaging in social situations and that has stifled me. I know if I weren't fat people would find me attractive. I obsessively think about my looks everyday and become incredibly depressed anytime I see a fit man or a man who fits society's standard of attractiveness. What doesn't help is the sad awareness that if and when I lose weight I'll have loose skin so that means I will never know a life in a body that I'm comfortable with.

"I was someone who was considered solid, average built, or muscular until a couple of years ago. I had stopped taking care of me mentally and physically health and gained 60+ lbs, 160+ to 230+, in 2 years. It wreaked havoc on everything. Now I come from a large family where most are considered fat and tall,  weight over 220-300+ and height 5'10"" to 6'10"", so I was pretty used to watching others go through this. Just not myself. It's taken me three years to get over the trauma of gaining so much weight and how I perceived myself. Three years to process my internalized fatphobia and body dysmorphia. It wasn't until I actually looked at myself in the mirror in the light, like literally cause for 2 years I kept most lights off in the bathroom, and told myself ""if this is so you are now then so be it. Let's be this person. Let's love this person because this person is me now. Just because you are plus size or fat or obese doesn't mean you're not worthy of self-love. If you don't start know when do you plan to? At this rate it'll take to long and you'll cause havoc to your entire body. That's not okay and you deserve better from yourself"".

I'm not saying that this needs to be you saying this, but you are worthy of so much more self-love and self-compassion.

Does anyone else just feel torn about certain things that have to do with your mental health? For example, I worked at this fast food restaurant for about a year and me being neurodivergent and dealing with ppl made it even more stressful. I felt like I was being mistreated so much by not only customers but by the staff. I eventually left bc of Covid but that was my first actual job and I was appreciative at first but it wore me out. I was so stressed out at that job that I started dissociating so much and the quality of my work down. I've had burn out for years bc of it but now I'm somewhat ready to go back to work bc I'm tired of being cooped up in this house and getting a job is the easiest way for me to socialize with others. But I have to prepare for that again. Any advice? And can anyone relate to what I'm going through?	Lexonfiyah	post	12.919607030476726	female	White	0.9982409477233887	na	na	na	2	BlackMentalHealth
"Some of the best things that help me cope with my ADHD&ASD, MDD, PTSD, and being a queer black woman in a fat body are: 1. Daily affirmations. 2. Realizing that nobody gives a shit about me personally, 3. realizing that the companies I owe money to every month absolutely do not give a shit about me, 4. The power phrases of ""Will do, I believe you, I'm right on it, thank you."" 5. Smiling. 

1- daily affirmations. I hype myself up all the time. Everytime I look in a mirror I give myself all the compliments out loud. This took about a year to start working but it's better than any of the antidepressants I've been on or am currently on. 

2- If you expect people to give a shit, be kind, take your ND into account, or otherwise accommodate you then you boo boo the fool because ain't nobody give a fuck about you or your feelings. You assume you shouldn't be mistreated, so you're in pain when you are. But take a step back and really look at the world and people in it. I'm descended from human salves, people enslave and sell each other. People are fucked up. We're the most fucked up animals on earth because we don't give each other basic dignity. But we don't. it would be better if we all did, and maybe we will. But I stopped being in so much pain when I stopped expecting to be treated well by other people. 
It's shitty, but it definitely helps. 

3-the power company never gave me a single discount for being so depressed i couldn't feed myself or shower. The phone company never gave me a month off of paying a bill because life was so difficult to understand that I fantasized about ending all day every day. I still have to pay them on time every month to have a phone, heat, lights, water, a place to live, food. Working retail is working for money. Working food service is working for money. I'm not at work to have a good time or make friends, I'm there for money because I like having heat. I grew up homeless, having a house with heat and food is fucking awesome. Go to work for money. Make money. Go home. 

4 power phrases. This was a game changer. Angry customers? Look at their face (it took me a while to get the hang of looking at people in the eyes, i tend to look at glasses and eyebrows) and say ""I believe you."" Someone's order wrong ""I believe you"" then get the manager or remake the food or whatever. Just make them happy to go away. It doesn't matter. 

Manager ask you to do something, but you're doing other things they asked you to do ""I'm right on it"" or ""will do"". And then go back to finishing up whatever you're doing or if your manager expects you to leave things half done to jump on something new then do that. 
Find a job where you do the same types of things in the same order every day. 
'Thank you"" or ""ok thank you"" i would use as punctuation to most statements. Guess who went from being ""difficult"" to being a model employee. 

Smiling is key, smile most of the time. Smile at people. Smile when you say thank you. It gets people off your back. 

Bonus - clean the bathrooms. Nobody likes it but it's great because you're alone for what 10-15 minutes. I made that my job everywhere i worked. Probably was really gross 5% of the time and was a great break from anyone else 95% of the time. 

These are all the best tips that helped me get through retail from 14-34. Now that I work for myself alone from my home office 90% of my problems have evaporated. Find a career you enjoy, it's awesome. Until then i hope something in here helps you at all. 

I wish that people were less shitty and more understanding.

"I've been acutely aware of it my whole life, and it seems like since I've entered the workforce almost a decade ago it's been /very/ noticeable how easily I'm dismissed because I'm a Black woman. I'm neurodivergent too, and even though it all intersects within my identity it sometimes feels like ""neurodivergent"" is a whole nother thing people don't want to unpack about me. As if they have a hard enough time keeping up with the fact that I'm both Black and a woman at the same time. 

It's things like someone asking me a question then googling my answer in front of me because they didn't think I was right. (Why'd you ask in the first place?) Things like ignoring a choice I've made without considering why I made it. Or even when I'm informed of things that I'm already aware of... because I'd already brought it to their attention and was dismissed.

"It affects my mental health when I click. I'm always tempted but every time I give in I end up feeling deeply hurt, ashamed, bitter, broken, angry, dismayed, hopeless, etc. It just brings up a lot of unhealed things in me and gives me new ammunition to dig into those wounds.

So now I work hard to avoid it, maybe mentally wish the people involved in the discussion well because I understand the mindset they're stuck in, preferring to play the blame game instead of seeking solutions within themselves. It's a tough tough mentality to climb out of without the proper tools and our community definitely lacks health coping skills. 

Purging your social media is a great idea. I'm always changing reddit accounts because it's easier to set up a fresh algorithm than change an old one sometimes.

"I hate hearing this is your experience. I know that the art of dating has been mauled to death by social media and dating apps, but do not let this shake your confidence. Some women are still into games and they do not want to appear interested. I did that in my 20s, but that was also before social media. I know that in the era of #metoo you have to be careful when approaching a woman, but approach the woman with confidence. Depending of the age of the women you are interested in, they may be so involved with their electronic devices they don't see you. 

BTW My ex husband saw me several times before I saw him. We lived in a small town and I didn't want to be involved in small town relationship drama.

"So, I'm an incredibly unhappy person. I'm sure many could say that I'm truly depressed. But I'm 30 years old and I'm living a life that I'm unhappy with because of the way that I look I'm fat (because my parents raised me to be a fat child via emotional eating induced by a parent) lack of experiences, lack of a social life, lack of romantic experiences.. all of the things that the average 30 year old has done up to this age, I haven't. And that makes me sad. 


Sometimes I think it's easy to say a person in my situation is just depressed and needs to go to therapy.... it's much harder for people to sit with the truth that someone can be unhappy about the circumstances of their life and that things need to change in their life in order for their feelings to change.

I feel like in our effort to become more conscious of mental illness, we've become a culture that has pivoted from just calling people crazy in an insensitive way and shifted to simply telling people to go to therapy.. we're still not taking into consideration how people have moved through the world. What people have experienced in how they feel. We're still teaching people that if they are not happy there is something wrong with them."

"I agree with some of what you've said. Validating our feelings is absolutely critical. Like...YES, you are totally correct that our culture just wants us to shut up, stuff it down, and keep going. Don't bum anybody out by bringing them down, or not being pleasing to look out, loooooooorrrrrrrrrrrd, no, don't do that at *any* cost! (Can you hear my eyes rolling on that one?) And that's a broken way to set things up. That shit hurts! And we should be able to say so! We should be able to hold folks accountable when they cause pain, whether on a personal level, or a whole daggone social level! That shit is not okay!

On the flip side of the coin, though, I feel like my own experience has shown me a few things that maybe push back on some of the other ideas in here. 

For example--my experience of therapy hasn't been that it's something to ""fix"" you from being ""broken"" or having something wrong with you, and make you ""happy."" It teaches you skills to navigate shitty, challenging, hurtful stuff that comes at you from the outside and the inside. And it still hurts, and you still feel it. But it might not clobber you, and stick, and wound, and break, and scar up like it used to. And you heal quicker, and you keep growing afterwards in a way that doesn't feel bent. 

Like...I've been in therapy for a long time, and I've gotten to a place in my life where a series of the craziest shit that's ever happened to me happened in rapid succession for *months* on end, with no break, after a really hard period of time had already happened. My feet got knocked out from under me every time I staggered back up, and I was like, ""Well...shit. Here we go again. Guess this might as well happen, now."" But in my innermost self, I felt like, ""Well, this sucks right now, but it's gonna get better."" Day in, day out, crisis after crisis. For MONTHS. 

And that's where I think the difference lies, in all of that. Absolutely, when shit is shitty, it's 100% correct to be unhappy about it. It's healthy to be unhappy about it. And when you've got it in you to do something to make changes, awesome. And when you don't, and you need to sit within yourself and gather yourself together and protect your peace, that's valid, too. 

And then there's a component of resilience. It's not being able to take a bunch of hard knocks. It's not being able to bear abuse. It's not being able to ""deal."" It's having an element of healing that figures out what you need, within you, to get to the other side and get back to being yourself. And that doesn't mean happy, necessarily! ""Happy"" is not a sustainable state of being! But like...content. Rested. Quiet. Okay. Basic. Breathing. Present. Chill. Whatever that means for you. Stable. You know? 

Therapy's not really for becoming happy. I feel like sports is a good metaphor, as cheesy and played as it may sound. It's work. You have to stretch, and flex, and reach, and bend, and jump. And you have to *practice.* It's not just sitting there and talking about your problems, although that's part of some types of therapy. There's all different types, and some of it is very skill-focused (DBT, or Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, for example). 

Anyway, I know that was a lot, but that's my perspective."	MCKC1992	reply	na	na	na	0.9973093271255493	weak	no	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"I am so excited (and also nervous) about the new year. I have a list of goals I want to accomplish, some a bit bolder than I'm used to. Definitely stepping our of my comfort zone for sure. Even writing this now I can feel my heart racing. The imposter syndrome is starting to kick in.

One of my main goals for the new year is to further my reach and influence as a mental health advocate in my country and the Caribbean. I'm from the Virgin  Islands and was diagnosed as bipolar after my first manic episode in January 2022. In the Caribbean, mental health isn't taken as seriously as it should be. Even though we're doing a lot better than before, it's not our top priority as a people.

 When I was struggling the months after my diagnosis, I couldn't find a support group or anyone who was experiencing the same things as me. No one wanted to share because of the shame of having a mental health disorder. So I decided to take up the mantle and began to open up about [my story](https://dopamineontherocks.com/my-story-living-with-bipolar-disorder/). In October I launched [my blog](https://dopamineontherocks.com/) and the outpour of love and support was unreal. I was even invited to be an ambassador for our mental health department. But I'm still doubting myself.

How can I put myself out there even more, when it scares me? How can I be an ambassador when I don't have it all figured out myself? How am I going to speak at these events among doctors who have years and years of training and experience? I'm an accountant for Christ sake!

I'd really appreciate a little confidence boost."	CreateWithMel	post	34.867878600889945	female	White	0.0037384077440947294	na	na	na	5	BlackMentalHealth
">How can I be an ambassador when I don't have it all figured out myself?

Honestly? I think that's a plus, and people often don't realize it. ""Look, I'm figuring this thing out, too, and I don't have all the answers, but if we work together and build each other up, we can weave a safety net"" is a GREAT way to approach community-based capacity building and advocacy, in my opinion. 

Yes, it takes *some* level of expertise and guidance. But people often don't want to hear from someone who has all the answers and has it all together. They want to hear from someone *real.* From someone who *knows* the hurt they feel and can say, ""Me too, fam/friend, me too. I know your struggle. I see you. I hear you. I feel you. You are not alone. You are not crazy. You are real. We are real. We are valid."" 

THAT'S SO VITAL! And that might be part of why you received such a positive response. I think, in places where people feel silenced, a brave voice in that empty darkness is like a beacon, and people will row and swim toward it in their multitudes, because at last they feel found. 

The doctors in the room have training, but YOU HAVE LIVED IT. You are not a chart on a wall, or a diagram in a book. You are the tears, and the fears, and the joys. The breath, and the blood, and the bones. You are the words and the wisdom. You are the LIFE. You have the story, and no one else can tell it like you can.

"I was pontificating to my crew on another social media site about protecting your peace over the holidays, and how hard you have to work to do that sometimes. And kinda boiled it down to: 

> Peace can be hard won when you have to battle dragons who hoard your love. 

Which really struck me after I typed it. 

Like...yep. Those folks who will take and take and take every piece of your heart, and sit in their cave being a nasty threat, if you dare try to brave the darkness to get any of it back. And it feels like it's gonna be the fight of a lifetime every time, and you may not make it out in one piece, if at all. And if you just walk away, you're leaving all those pieces of yourself behind, and it's treasure you'll never see again, in the clutches of someone who doesn't deserve it. 

In my experience, walking away can bring a lot of peace on its own. Yeah, you might not get that time back. And you might have some scars. But you still have yourself, and you can grow in ways you never knew, because you're not trapped in a dark cave, feeding your heart to a dragon. You can be out in the sunlight, feeding your heart with things that bring you joy and renewal. So it can really be worth it.

"Hey, glad you were able to get some help! That's a great feeling. :)

I dunno what your history is like, but my personal experience was that I was misdiagnosed as depression/anxiety for years, and given antidepressants, mostly. Turns out I have bipolar, and when I started taking mood stabilizers, I started to see some different effects that eventually got me to a place of actual stability. 

Granted, stabilizers are one of those classes of drugs that take FOREVER to start working, and can eff you up real quick if you stop taking them too fast, which you've already said you know. And there's a wide-ass range of them out there, so even if it's a good idea for you to be on one, it can take a few tries to find a match. 

Just some perspective. My go-to has always been to just be 100% honest about all the effects, let my prescriber know if I'm feeling ""off"" in any way, and keep a journal of my mental and physical state (I use an app, but whatever method is most doable). Stuff like, ""Hey, I'm super thirsty all the time, what's up with that?"" can be really relevant."	wermpiss	reply	na	na	na	0.0012049945071339607	weak	strong	strong	na	BlackMentalHealth

They see their mixed kids as a trophy ‚Äúo wow my light skinned child has green eyes‚Äù more than their actual children. 

Being that hateful is extremely harmful to everybody around. If your mom is saying extremely insensitive things about black people, does it feel like she‚Äôs saying those same things about you, too? 
Is that how she sees you? 
What makes you different from ALLLLL the other black people (aside from her being your mom)? 

She‚Äôs acting like she did your dad a favour by being with him. Those things she said when you were arguing, are comments you really need to think about then think, do you really want someone who‚Äôs supposed to protect you and love you tell you that they don‚Äôt care about your safety as a black person? 

You‚Äôre allowed to stand up for yourself, and you absolutely should. You‚Äôre allowed to set boundaries, and you absolutely should. Your boundaries are there to protect YOU. Your boundaries are about YOU and nobody else. You‚Äôre allowed to set boundaries with your family! And you absolutely should, ESPECIALLY if they‚Äôre crossing emotional lines, physical, whatever it is! Some people are against blacklisting family members, but you have to do so for your own mental well-being. 

Never tolerate racism. You‚Äôre black and beautiful and it must suck for your mom that you‚Äôre prettier than her, and she knows that. 

Racism can be rooted personal insecurities, a lack of compassion, projection of flaws and/or extreme hatred or fear. Hatred is rooted in fear, and when it comes to racists it‚Äôs fear of ‚Äúlosing power‚Äù. So to counter feeling that way, they‚Äôll seek social support from people who have the same opinions. 

Your mom has shown us (and most important, you) who she is, how she feels about you. You don‚Äôt have to keep shitty people in your life just because their ‚Äúfamily‚Äù. Family isn‚Äôt an excuse to abuse someone you claim to love.

"OP, I hate to break it to you like this.
The only way is for you to pause your relationship with your mother and for you to try different therapy techniques. Perhaps ketamine, or drugs for symptom resistant depression. 

Learn meditation, change your diet, alter your nutrition. Do absolutely whatever it takes.

Your mother will not change, she doesn't understand, and she doesn't want to understand. You will hurt yourself trying to appeal to her when she refuses to even comprehend your problems. This comes down to ego, as she would feel at fault for your depression. So she will treat you like you are sick or crazy, as that implies it's external or like something that you caught. 

 I am a black man who had a narcissistic and very old school mother that had absolutely no idea on how to deal with mental health. If you felt bad then it was obviously demons or you just not being appreciative enough. Working with my mother only damaged me and my relationships.


The only thing that helped me, was working with a therapist that legit had some serious skills with hypnosis and NLP."	gwgw888	reply	na	na	na	0.9966314435005188	weak	no	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
"I have been depressed for over 2 years. I am struggling to get by in school and life and my academics are suffering. I had an internship with a full time job offer but the ended up rescinded it because my level of effort was low, which is a result of my depression. This has worsened my depression, even though i was already struggling to function. One multiple occasions over the last 2 years I have begged my mom to let me take time off and each time I have been told to push through. When I had suicidal ideation, and my psychiatrist called her she did not care and infect would call me sick when she was upset and claimed I was seeking attention or am being manipulative.

I have tried about 5 anti depressants and am on 4 different medications and still am depressed.

I am still struggling and realize that I am not in the position to be successful at school and while I could pass classes I would have a GPA that would shut out most opportunities if I do not act now and allow myself the time to recover.

How can I express to my mother how bad my depression is so that she lets me take the semester off to address some of these issues? The only way I know is to have a suicide attempt.

"Oh, this is suuuuuuuuuuch an interesting question!

I come from an environment that was very authoritarian and chaotic, with a lot of persistent, toxic stress, and different kinds of abusive behaviors.

As an adult, I've gone through a LOOOOOOOOT of therapy to learn to heal some of that, and deal with some of my own maladaptive tendencies and behaviors. I've also found myself in a career in the early childhood field, with close proximity to a lot of professionals in parenting education. And I have learned SO MUCH.

I feel like I approach parenting with a base of wanting to be consistent, and curious, and supportive. I want my kid to know he's safe with me, always, above all else. I want to let him try things, and fail (but not get big-time hurt), and figure things out for himself. I want to encourage him to explore, and to ask, ""Why?"" and ""How?"" And I want him to know he is loved.

Yes, I lose my patience sometimes, and I speak sharply. I've full-on yelled a few times. But man. I've got so much more patience than the adults in my life ever showed me. My son has had some real struggles, being an only child who spent almost 75% of his life in isolation with just his parents, because of COVID. I've sat there with some real Zen energy through some tantrums you wouldn't believe and just told that boy I love him and I'll help him figure out what he needs. I've shrugged my shoulders and taken some deep breaths and talked to him calmly about the choices he's making when he's been acting a damn fool. And he's learned how to apologize when he hurts people's feelings, and he's started to put two and two together about not getting the things he wants if he doesn't listen and follow directions. And we don't hit him.

And he's not ""spoiled!"" He's joyful and friendly and affectionate with other people, adults and children. Yeah, you gotta remind him to share and take turns, sometimes, but he's a preschooler and he's only really been around other kids regularly for like...less than a year. He's doing great, developmentally.

And bottom line, I genuinely think he's magnificent. He's a fascinating and funny little guy who wears me out, yes, but also brings me so much joy. I really do genuinely enjoy him. :)"	CreateWithMel	reply	na	na	na	0.004950440023094416	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

Hi there ‚ò∫Ô∏è. Yep been there when I was in my 20s.  Have you considered volunteering? Or meetups? Meetups involving video games?  I met people thru volunteering and at my last job. I also had to do some therapy and it was then that I learned that I had abandonment issues  (due to my mother‚Äôs untimely death as a kid) and that caused boundary issues.  I would smother people who befriended me until they would quite honestly ghost me lol.  I would be very hurt by that but started to understand the other person‚Äôs point of view. Then, I stopped taking it personally and then the frustration subsided.   I gave up being around people for a bit (to work on myself) until I got a tech job.  At work, I would crack jokes just being my usual self then people started to invite me to parties and their family homes and such. It took years for me to find people.  I still only have two that I consider really good friends.  I have a bunch of siblings but only see my sister on the holidays.  I‚Äôm socially awkward, a little quirky, and I accept that I may not be for everybody (and they may not be for me) but that‚Äôs OK!  But what I‚Äôd say to you is to not take the rejection personally (i know its hard). Adding, that **therapy** is key!!!!

"I‚Äôm sorry, everyone. I‚Äôm just tired and frustrated (and also know it‚Äôs self inflicting?).

I am not clinically diagnosed with anything, but I always had issues with socializing due to a semi strict childhood. Most of it was due to my family working or going to school, so I couldn‚Äôt really do anything or go anywhere because of no transportation. My mom didn‚Äôt have many friends either and she either wouldn‚Äôt or couldn‚Äôt ask them for help. I‚Äôve always been quiet, shy, and reserved unless I was really comfortable with someone (very rare). 

I‚Äôm 24 and am still like this, especially after a lot of failed, fake, and short lived friendships and a couple unhealthy relationships. I had a hard time telling if people were actually genuine and liked me or if they were just using me and talking shit behind my back. Anxiety and some paranoia around people and relationships (in all forms) developed. 

Edit: I started writing this before work and now it‚Äôs the end of my shift. I was very anxious at that moment lol, but I‚Äôm still concerned for myself. I just want to be better for myself and others.

With anyone else my social anxiety goes through the roof and I can‚Äôt manage to bring myself to hang out with people, make friends or go out. So I understand. Lately I have been wanting to make changes to feel more comfortable in public and around people in general. So my plan is to work on becoming more comfortable and confident with myself so that hopefully when I do decide to go out and meet people I feel okay with what I‚Äôm doing, and I‚Äôm not just doing it to do it. I think if I get to know myself better then it‚Äôll help me get to know other people better‚Ä¶ does it make sense?

"I was actually a lot like this for a long time. Social situations were terrifying. I‚Äôm in my 30‚Äôs now and i still have to work HARD to ignore that social anxiety. 

But what I‚Äôve realized is, and this is gonna sound dumb - other people like awkward a lot more than society thinks. 

In the past When my goofy ass did something hella awkward i would agonize over it for YEARS, avoid the person and punish myself‚Ä¶only to find out that it was barely a blip on their radar. Or they thought it was charming!!

That realization helped me to stop policing my personality. I am a Dumbass. I‚Äôm goofy. I love weird jokes.  I am not elegant. Im not suave. But i love talking about cats! I love reading!

"One thing I think is important to understand is that there are going to be ""layers"" or ""levels"" for your friendships. It's easy to feel like everybody needs to like, love, and accept you 100%, or if they don't reciprocate your level of devotion and dedication, then they're not ""really"" your friend and don't ""really"" care about you. That can send you into a spiral of feeling like everybody is fake and nobody cares about you, and damage your sense of self-worth. When in reality, it doesn't have to be that complicated, or that loaded.

It's totally cool to be just acquaintances with some folks, and not get in deep about your real personal stuff. And not always answer that text or call, and not always say yes to that ""maybe we should meet up."" You gotta figure out what the right balance is for folks, as far as giving vs. getting, of course. But don't feel like you need to go throw 110% of yourself at every person to be ""good enough"" to be their friend. You'll burn yourself out.

Similarly, it can help to sit down and think through what is ""green light, yellow light, red light"" territory to share with different levels of friend/acquaintance when it comes to your background, history, triggers for any sore spots or traumas, etc. For me, not everybody needs to know my full trauma stories. Not everybody needs to know I have a trauma history, period. 

But there can be some ""green light"" ways to share that at a very ""surface level"" situation. For example, ""The holidays are really tough for me, so if I seem kinda off and don't respond as quickly, please be patient with me. I'm doing my best and I really appreciate you. :)"" It's non-specific about the situation/history, but it's specific about *my anticipated behavior,* to the degree relevant, and *what I need from them* that will be helpful, and is *reasonable/doable*. 

I find that these points are very important and effective when managing your own mental health/social behaviors with others. If you already know some of your own patterns (which it seems like you've got good self-awareness, so you're already ahead of the game), it might be helpful to start making charts. If you like organizing things, that is. What are the ""levels"" of friendship you want? What do you want from folks at each of those levels? What's the ""job description"" for each of those? What parts of yourself do you feel you want or need to share with each to make it work?

And what else do you need in your support network? Like, there are things I can rely on some of my friends for, that I can't get from others. There are some things I can only go to my siblings for. There are some things that I'm gonna call my mom about first, and some things I'm gonna pick up the phone and text my old boss about. And there are some things that need to go straight to my therapist, or my psychiatric prescriber, or my doctor."	declutterthedrama	reply	na	na	na	0.9950683116912842	weak	no	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

i just don‚Äôt feel comfortable because as a woman, i don‚Äôt feel that i look pretty enough to identify as one. if i were a man, i‚Äôd probably accept the way i look more because my face passes decently for a male but not so much as a female. i know it‚Äôs very ridiculous but i wanted to talk abt it because i thought the feeling would go away but it‚Äôs getting worse and this is just another thing on top of the shit load of other things makin me go insane.

i guess it‚Äôs good to preface, i have bad body dysmorphia‚Ä¶

idk this is just one more thing that makes me want to stop living because my brain never shuts the fuck up, & i can‚Äôt take it anymore."	wermpiss	post	17.02209516579942	male	White	0.9986346364021301	na	na	na	5	BlackMentalHealth
Gender dysphoria afaik isn‚Äôt trans-only! I believe there have been explanations I‚Äôve seen from actual trans people that if you raise a bunch of cis boys as girls and vice versa, they‚Äôd also get gender dysphoria and that‚Äôs definitely valid. I think it‚Äôs also a bit different for black women specifically since we so often are seen as more masculine already so not fitting into the beauty standard can make you feel even more alienated from womanhood	wermpiss	reply	na	na	na	0.9986346364021301	no	no	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
If you feel more comfortable dressed as a man then do that. But don‚Äôt think about how anybody else sees you do what makes you comfortable and happy. Also being a woman is more than how you look. There are plenty of women that don‚Äôt fit the ‚Äústatus quo‚Äù with facial hair strong faces etc. due to hormone issues. Anybody can look ‚Äúpretty‚Äù these days though with a little make up and a wig. But ultimately do what makes you happy and a decent human being.	wermpiss	reply	na	na	na	0.9986346364021301	no	no	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
You sound really hard on yourself. My therapist tells me to be compassionate with myself. You need to do that. Also, western beauty standards are based on white supremacy. White supremacy is evil garbage. Please try to appreciate yourself and stop being so critical.	wermpiss	reply	na	na	na	0.9986346364021301	weak	no	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
"As i was reading i was thinking this sounds like B.D.D (body dysmorphic disorder) and you validated that at the very end! 
My sister was diagnosed with this a few years back but it started way before as a teen so I get you. 

The thing is the feelings are so real and valid for you but on the flip side others don't peeceive what you are seeing! So you may think you look masculine and unattractive  but others see you as looking wonderfully feminine and attractive. But if they tell you that you may feel they are lying(just being nice) or wary! Which is a tough spot for you as usually external opinion/validation can help us to balance our perception and allow that feedback in. But with B.D.D that avenue is kinda blocked! so the loop in your own mind is just continuous. 
 With my sis she would ask me about the area she was dysmorphic about and i would answer truthfully it looks fine but that too could get her really agitated as she thinks i am trying to spare her feelings. 
Have you thought about or done C.B.T before? 
You probably know all of this already lol but i just wanted to add my reddit stranger support as B.D.D is a bonafide mental health issue that can have a huuuuuge impact on your life! Ppl may make you feel like you are making a big deal oit of nothing but It is not a case of ""aaah you will get over it"" or ""you look fine forget about it""

I was finally able to have my psychiatrist appointment today, but it was a bit of a surprise on how it went. Apparently my last psychiatrist diagnosed me with a personality disorder ,?But I was never told and she didn‚Äôt specify which one exactly.

It‚Äôs pretty upsetting honestly overall, but it does give me relief that there could be something more, maybe I could get more answers possibly.

I‚Äôve already been diagnosed with dysthymia and ADHD. I also suffer from self harm."	aliensfoundmycameras	post	23.78300019472534	male	White	0.9975547194480896	na	na	na	1	BlackMentalHealth
Remember that the only functions of a diagnosis are to inform treatment (like prescribing) and get insurance reimbursement. A diagnosis isn't able to define who you are as a person, and the diagnosis may change with further, more accurate assessment, a different diagnostician, or your sustained use of skills. Take care of yourself and hopefully things go well with your current Psychiatrist.	aliensfoundmycameras	reply	na	na	na	0.9975547194480896	no	no	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
"I watched a YouTube video and it really pissed me off tbh. It wasnt unique in any way but it was an example of the all too common phenomenon within our community of treating black mens mental health  as some kind of joke. Like I know there's toxicity within black male spaces,  but where's  the compassion? I know black women have it hard, but why are mens emotions so objectified? Otherwise intelligent people who come out with ""fuck black men"" and ""black men ain't shit"" statements.  

I go to a counsellor/therapist here and they don't understand or care to understand (no black counsellors in my part of the UK),  i go online and the things im experiencing ... im a joke. Im a bum, a loser, i ain't shit. Its not like i want to be 'shit'. Im trying.  I dont have real breaks. Im on the grind all the time. No advice or support besides get your shit together. I go to these stupid black professional  forums and it's all about black excellence. Grind, work hard, fuck your feelings... plus these spaces are very Black African and I feel as though as a Caribbean im made to feel like an outsider. 

There's only so long I can just be like ""ill bee dat"" like Redman, but my life really is shit. Trying to get my career off, job interview after job interview to get out of my entry level office job (post graduation) so I can finally leave home and start my life. Its like I'm chasing after just one yes, but its never going to come. I don't want to live with my mother. I graduated after covid and I've been trying so hard to get a job that would actually enable me to move out and rent.  Money would solve a lot of my problems. 

I just feel as a black man there is nowhere to go, no place I would be able to experience some kind of brotherhood unless I go to the right (e.g. the red pill crowd, incels etc), but I'm not doing that because I hate what those people stand for and they are down right wrong.  

I have no friends,  no social life besides going to drink with my white and Asian colleagues who aren't friends at all (it's just business; trying to keep things nice so I can progress my career). The only thing I have is art and talking to myself.  My life is fucking miserable. My mum even mocked my relationship with my ex after trying to confide in her that I felt suicidal. That I've just about had enough of life.   Shit really hurt me and there's no apology. Now she's acting like it never happened and I have to just pretend everything is OK just to keep things civil."	mpchooligan	post	19.005397943806805	female	White	0.9988142251968384	na	na	na	16	BlackMentalHealth

"First I want to acknowledge your feelings and I want you to know that they are real. I want to hold that space for you. 

I know I‚Äôm a woman‚Äî but out of college I was on my ‚Äúgrind‚Äù and got very high up in my profession by 29. And by my 30th birthday I was forced to resign due to mental health problems. 

Keep looking for work and something you love, but don‚Äôt lose sight of taking care of you. If society won‚Äôt take care of you‚Äî start with yourself. Friends and jobs and lovers will come in due time. 

But have the space in yourself to feel all of your feelings‚Äî don‚Äôt force them down. Don‚Äôt wait for someone to create a space for you. Be real with yourself. Be kind to yourself. Be kind to all the versions and manifestations of you‚Äî child you, teen you,‚Ä¶You said you talk to yourself- journal. Write to a future you. Tell him all of your hopes and dreams and fears. 

I also don‚Äôt have a huge black community around me‚Äî but I do have great friends that have a lot of common interests with me. So that will come for you in due time as well. 

Money will solve your logistical problems and that is very VERY important. I acknowledge that is an issue and I won‚Äôt say ‚Äúmoney won‚Äôt solve how you feel‚Äù. It might not solve all of it but hell 50% at least would be nice. 

Sometimes our parents have traumas that they haven‚Äôt healed and they project them onto those around them. Everyone is capable of doing it but you don‚Äôt have to take that and make it your own. 

Your life isn‚Äôt shit. Right now it is hard, but it‚Äôs worth living. Don‚Äôt give up. But on the days where it‚Äôs hard, acknowledge that. On the days where it‚Äôs sunshine, acknowledge those too.

"This is really heartbreaking and I feel you. Unfortunately, I think for this to shift, just like anything else, it will require trailblazers who choose to swim against the tide of the status quo.

I can see your words are powerful here and resonated with some people. I know you're in the UK, but there's a org that has had virtual programming for black men called BEAM in the US that might be worth looking into. The organization is a black mental health org that was started by a black man.

I also think cis and hetero black men in my experience really struggle with collaborating with gay and trans black men who they might actually be able to have as allies. I have conversations with queer and trans black men, but a lot of times misogyny and transphobia keeps cis and hetero black men from the very people who might share these sentiments, and that work needs to be done because ultimately, that bias was bred into black men due to colonization from white people. Again, trailblazing might find that your allies are in places that aren't your first instict.

I had to start my journey with reading books and doing a lot of self work. A lot of this trauma is cultural and inherited and in order to even know where to begin I had to look for the resources myself. I recommend the books My Grandmother's Hands, and The Will To Change to begin. All About Love is pretty good too. I can almost guarantee if you are able to develop a habit of talking about these things more openly, even risking rejection from people too insecure to hear you without ridicule, you message will resonate with the people in your orbit who are feeling the same way and you will call in your tribe to you because they will know you're a safe person to talk about these things with.

"I'm so sorry you're all alone and your mom didn't take your suicidal thoughts seriously. It's okay to let her know she let you down if she's acting confused why you're not as close. It's okay for you to not act like everything is okay. 

I definitely encourage you to seek out professional help if you're still feeling suicidal! It may require cutting back on other things to afford, but your mental health should be a priority. 

Honestly, I think the same way everyone else makes a ""safe space"" and protects each other as a community, Black men are long overdue to do that for each other too. Make those online groups, discuss mental health with each other, advocate, share resources. 

I participate in a lot of community mental health groups and sadly the only times I really see BM advocate for their mental health, it's when someone else is asking for help and they are saying it's not as much as they go through or if we think they have it hard, we should see what a BM goes through. 

**I never really just see something just for BM, by BM.** Meanwhile, if I wanted to join a healing circle by BW, I could find a dozen in 15 minutes. Somethings gotta change in that sector for sure, and it can't all be focused on what other people aren't doing enough for BM, it needs to come from within. I'd definitely support it if I saw it in any way I can. 

**We live in a dog eat dog, Capitalist society where everything is for sale and nothing is sacred**...It's hard, it's stressful, it's cruel. One of the few survival techniques people have found is everyone carving out their own corner to try and heal in, and it usually takes getting the train rolling to get others to jump on board. 

A Black woman (nor any other type of person) isn't going to swoop in and successfully save BM, least of all without y'all being clear on your needs and giving direction...Y'all are definitely going to have to start taking your mental health seriously first and advocating for yourself first just like you see other groups doing for themselves, their rights, their needs. We can't speak for you. 

I encourage you to write or speak on this on social media and see if you can't gain a following with a very Black man mental health centered project that doesn't focus on others , but focuses and centers on you and y'all as a collective.

I can tell you now, even those who claim to care don't. People often say that they are alone but still have a number of people with whom they regularly communicate. I receive religious quotes from my aunt every day, but she sends them in mass texts. Outside of that, I talk to myself all the time. It has been this way long enough for me to now go out of my way just to avoid other people because I've grown to prefer my own company only. One of the biggest causes for such a development was how people I thought were supposed to be close to me (relatives & former friends) would ridicule, exacerbate, disregard, or deny the conditions I have which were all professionally diagnosed. Next to that cause were encounters of other people seemingly either entertained or offended by my public relapses. Even if someone has genuine intentions to help, they eventually seem to forget how mental illnesses work & start fading away while denying it whenever they're questioned about their increasing absences.	mpchooligan	reply	na	na	na	0.9988142251968384	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

Im a black woman that had schizophrenia and schozoaffective order bakc in April and May I was hearing a lot of voices like a lot of racist voices ones - The voices I would hear were very racist voices that don't make me feel good about myself and say a lot of racial epithets ( n word , monkey , gorilla , making fun of slavery and making a lot of anti-Black jokes) and like making fun of my life and just not making me feel good at the same time I was hearing these voices I started to hallucinate and see specific people saying racist stuff to me and attacking me because I kept hallucinating those specific people and hearing their voices and seeing their faces so when I kept hearing myself be called racial epithets by a couple of these voices I started to react badly online and attack those people because I kept feeling like they were after me in real life and I was so delusional cause I would hallucinate them in real life and thought they were after me and I thought they manifested themselves into my head to be doing all this and kept Astral projecting or were witches and wizards and kept popping up and disappearing to torment me. Is this bad or is how I reacted bad ? Feeling really guilty about it and wondering How those people feel cusse I said so much mean stuff about people that did nothing  to me   Not sure how to stop feeling guilty. Is how I reacted normal ? It took me a while to realize I was hallucinating cause I was delusional and kept hearing so much racist stuff and like being taunted by those people when I‚Äôd see their profile. I was even hallucinating text messages IG posts and DMs and thought these people were after me. Like they‚Äôd comment on everything I was doing like my features , weight , clothes , family , anything in my life and it would mess with my mental a lot.

I am a big advocate for doing what you want with your body. I don‚Äôt know I just think that intention nowadays is completely ignored.

Also can some people please give me some subreddits to talk about more general black issues? Thanks"	Underwater_Bro	post	24.177336695291885	male	White	0.17135901749134064	na	na	na	4	BlackMentalHealth

I am Black. Just do you. Understand that we Blacks do dreads because of our hair texture and the for the natural hair community it is the most conventional way to wear our hair texture. The culture for us is our natural hair that grows out of our head and how it has been shunned and ridiculed for hundreds of years and deemed unattractive. We wear dreads because it is a very good way and easy way to wear our hair texture. Style is one thing but to find styles that mesh with our texture is another.  But it doesn't chap my ass to see other races wear it. I really don't care. Do you.	Underwater_Bro	reply	na	na	na	0.17135901749134064	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
"To me, it's just like...why? Why would you want to do that with your hair if it's not made for your hair or your culture? 

I just don't know why we can't have some hairstyles to ourselves. Other races have hairstyles to themselves (well- except for white people, most of their hairstyles are fair game for anyone who has hair similar to theirs). I, as a black person, would not try to do a Daeng'gi Meori as it is a traditional Korean hairstyle and it's not a part of my culture (and it would weird asf with hair). This isn't to say that non-Korean people can't do any Korean hairstyle since there are plenty that you can do if you have hair closer to theirs, just not the traditional ones. On the flipside, any K-Pop idol I have seen that does box braids or cornrows looks a hot ass mess on top of the fact that it's not their culture. Thankfully I haven't see one of them with dreadlocks yet.

To me, some hairstyles belong to certain cultures and shouldn't be practiced outside of those cultures. Now I'm not going to actively attack anyone who does dreadlocks and isn't black (at least not to their face/on a post they made or something), but I really don't think anyone who isn't black should do hairstyles made for black people- just like we shouldn't do hairstyles made for other cultures. I'm all for doing you (I can't not be- peep the profile picture), but this isn't an example of that imo."	Underwater_Bro	reply	na	na	na	0.17135901749134064	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
"I am a 30 year old black woman. I was raised in a strict religious home (Jehovahs witness) and physically abused as a child by my father for religious purposes. (Which is why I‚Äôm an atheist now) I also lost my mother to Covid in 2020 and still am going thru my stages of grief and that experience.

Recently I have been trying to get help for my life long anger issues, trauma, and grief. For the last few months my mood has been up and down plus I have a mentally stressful job as a call center employee (listening to other ppls problems and complaints daily takes a toll). It was one customer that was about to send me over the edge of ending it so I was calling in and my manager helped my by putting me on leave of absence. When this is done your job needs paperwork filled out by a doctor that you are seeking help and that you indeed need time off work. I didn‚Äôt have a doctor so I began looking for one. I looked thru providers and EVERY doctor I call is booked. I go to my primary care physician for a referral to see if that would work faster. When I go in there they stare at me as if I‚Äôm an alien and shrug their shoulders at my tears and give me a referral but then they put on my paperwork ‚Äúwe only can treat SERIOUS medical issues‚Äù as if my mental health is not of any concern. Then the referral they gave me had the wrong date on it so that psychiatrist was unable to treat me. Then I call my Employer Assistance Program for help finding a doctor and they find one. The therapist was Hispanic (I prefer black but was fine bc at least she was a person of color). Advise her of my current situation and what I hope to get out of therapy. Every session I‚Äôm in with her I am sharing my pain with her crying thinking I was in a safe space to express myself. The whole time she was telling me what I was feeling was valid and never told me that my condition was not serious or that I should return to work. Then when she submitted the paperwork for my job she made it seem like it was nothing wrong and that I didn‚Äôt need time off work and that I was only there pretending so I could have extra time. I know this bc when my paperwork was denied and I called the office there extremely rude receptionist said to me verbatim ‚ÄúYou cannot ask the therapist to LIE on paperwork for extra time off work‚Äù. 

Every time I go to doctors I feel like I‚Äôm treated like a liar. Like there couldn‚Äôt be anything wrong with me. And I feel like it‚Äôs bc I‚Äôm a black woman. No one ever takes how I feel seriously until I start yelling and cursing and then I‚Äôm just another angry black b**ch. How do black ppl get help with mental health issues? And get doctors to take us seriously?"	Helkattt	post	34.83267995745058	male	White	0.9985489249229431	na	na	na	5	BlackMentalHealth
"I think that the problem is that not all practitioners are good practitioners. And I think there is another stigma that black people are med seeking or in your case LOA seeking. 

I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you but there are caring practitioners out there. I have a white psych and a white therapist and they are leaps and bounds over any black pairing I found.

"It sounds really difficult what you are going through right now. It's so fucked up that our systems are the way that they are and that nobody was there to help or guide you. EAP will almost never be able to approve time off requests for anything other that active substance use or you being a high risk for violence to your coworkers. I've worked for years with insurance and, and EAPs are not there to help you, they're there to reduce risk to your employer. 

If you have employer health insurance and you're in the USA, check out [Headway ](https://headway.co/) or [Alma](https://helloalma.com/) or [Sondermind](https://www.sondermind.com/) to find a provider that can bill your insurance. 
You can find out of network therapists that can still submit insurance claims at [Advekit](https://www.advekit.com/)
If your insurance doesn't cover mental health, you can fill out the form from [Loveland Therapy Fund](https://thelovelandfoundation.org/therapy-fund/) and request vouchers for 4 -12 free therapy sessions and the Loveland Foundation is accepting Applications right now. (If your insurance does cover mental health, you can't use this voucher). 

Finding a black therapist that takes Loveland vouchers or insurance is easiest by searching [Therapy for Black Girls](https://therapyforblackgirls.com/) or [Black Female Therapists ](https://www.blackfemaletherapists.com/directory/)

Lots of places (often churches) have grief support groups and those are usually free, you can find a group at [grief share ](https://www.griefshare.org/findagroup)

There aren't enough therapists and there aren't enough black therapists.

Months later I talk to my mom and she's telling me that I told my dad no they can't visit us. I'm so confused why they always trying to make me the bad guy. When I speak up for myself it's always ""well we are your parents"" like they don't have to respect changed plans or even ""No"" why is that we can't say No to our parents.

"Hmm. I've had that issue with some other folks in my family (from a different background/culture) who just feel like children are basically property, and should be ""obedient"" to whatever the adults in their life tell them to do. Never talk back, never have opinions, just meekly accept everything and quietly become exactly the person the adults want them to be, no exceptions. It's authoritarian. And if you dare to deviate from the plan and actually be yourself, or try to have boundaries, you're ""rebellious"" or ""stubborn"" or ""hard-headed"" or ""self-centered."" All that nonsense. 

I started cutting contact on folks until they could get their act together. Letting folks know what I would and would not do, and then sticking to it. And they got butt-hurt, and angry, and all sorts. I had to yell and holler and cuss some folks out, at one point, for them to understand I meant business. But I wasn't going to get pushed around anymore. I'm an adult, I'm going to live my life. I'm not gonna come when called, like a dog. I'm not gonna bend myself into a pretzel trying to please you. You can put some work into this relationship, too. You can earn my time, and consider my wants and needs, and give me some respect. Or you can fuck off. I don't need the stress and headaches. I've got to protect my peace, and fill my time with things that lift me up, not drag me down. 

I don't know if that's something you feel would work for you, or you could do right now. But that's my experience, and I just wanted to share as a perspective. Best wishes."	Key_Possibility_5508	reply	na	na	na	0.9994146823883057	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

First, I‚Äôm sorry you got kicked out but this may turn out to be for the best.  It don‚Äôt sound like you and your mom mesh well.  About the job, no one likes aggressive energy this said, we gotta keep our cool even when the boss is getting loud because they have the upper hand in that instance and can use what you say (and how you say it) to instantly fire you (even when you are right).  Next time, go to HR and start a paper file, get your side of the story out there first. Are you in some kind of therapy?  I feel like you are a ball of anxiety and you may even need to start medication.  I used to take medicine for depression.  It helped calm things down then I was able to learn what triggers me, calm myself down, then act accordingly because I was in and out of jobs thru my whole 20s lol.  Life is full of chaos and rudeness (there‚Äôs no avoiding it) but we have to learn how to handle it then come out on top, sometimes that may mean taking medication. Nothing wrong with that.	crazygurl3	reply	na	na	na	0.9991993308067322	strong	no	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"Do you absolutely love it and maintain it? Do you love it and then go back to your own life? Or can you not stand the commercialization, make believe, sometimey, and seasonal depression that goes on around this time of year? 

I‚Äôm doing my best to befriend people, be supportive, encouraging, and a good relative. But much of it saved for a select few feels very onesided. Something‚Äôs happened to me late summer/early this fall that were out of my control and set me back financially (temporarily) but as a fully grown adult. I‚Äôve grown and matured and remain charitable. Spiritually I‚Äôve been awakened and am ever evolving. I don‚Äôt get many passes like others want from me and get misunderstood often. My lifestyle changes have brought that on but I feel better and know that even when I‚Äôm lonely I‚Äôm not alone. Was hoping to be in a solid relationship/partnership with someone‚Äôs daughter and have a baecation this year. 

Shit happens and it‚Äôs fucked up but not end of the world you know. Plus we all not for everyone and many have or had unresolved trust issues that allows us not moving forward well. Therapy has helped along with healthy discussions, and self-care. Just don‚Äôt want to hate people who don‚Äôt deserve it or myself. So I mostly keep my distance, strive to stay unashamed, and unshakable.

Hi there! I hate the commercialization of Christmastime but I try to remember what Christmas is actually about and that gets me warm and fuzzy.  Sometimes seasonal depression creeps in but it‚Äôs not as bad as it was years ago.  New Year‚Äôs (and that final week leading up to Dec 31st) fills me with Hope ‚ú®.  I don‚Äôt let myself think too far into the future.  I‚Äôm one of those one day at a time people but I think of the New Year as time for me to start with a semi-fresh slate and try new things and try to do better than this year. So I guess I try to keep the momentum of Hopefulness going into the New Year.  You mention having setbacks but now feeling better. I‚Äôm glad about that.  You don‚Äôt have to have everything figured out and things will start to come into place.  Keep evolving, you got this.

"I had a hateful relationship with Christmas for many of my adult years, due to having some shitty times around the holidays, and just some real weird associations with toxic stress at that time of year, during childhood. It wasn't 100% terrible, and there are some positive memories in there. But there was a lot of anxiety and dread associated with it. And then resentment that I didn't have that cookie-cutter, gingerbread, holly-jolly childhood.

Buuuuut a few years ago, when I was in a department store tryna buy some regular-ass socks or something, and Mariah Carey came on the airwaves AGAIN, it broke something in me, and I was like, ""YOU KNOW WHAT?! FUCK IT!!! FINE!!! IF IT'S GONNA BE CHRISTMAS, I'M GONNA BE CHRISTMAS, TOO!!! DECK THE HALLS, MOTHERFUCKERS!!! HOLLY-JOLLY THIS, ASSHOLES!!!"" And I started smiling, out of spite. I was gonna be the most holly-jolly, sleigh-bell-ringing, carol-singing, joy-to-the-world motherfucker in that department store, and I was takin' everybody down candy-cane lane with me, goddammit.

And I actually started kinda having a good time. And then I was like, ""...shit. I'm allowed to enjoy this, if I want to. I can just...LIKE Christmas. I can do that. I'm an adult, now. I can choose to feel how I want to feel about this. I can buy a tree. I can wrap my own presents. I can buy myself something I actually want, and wrap it for myself, and open it. I can make my own traditions. I can...HAVE THE CHRISTMAS I ALWAYS WANTED.""

Went outta there like Ebenezer Scrooge at the end of A Christmas Carol, feelin' like, ""It's not too late! I haven't missed it! There's still time for CHRISTMAS!!!"" And ever since then, I've really enjoyed the holidays, because I just...do what I want. And if I don't feel like doing something, I don't.

"srry if this isn‚Äôt rlly coherent, i‚Äôm still kinda of out of it. i get triggered by small things and then i start to spiral and break down, but now it‚Äôs been happening more frequently. just a few hours ago i was having an episode, my mind just fixated on my killing myself the entire time throughout, at one point i walked around the house to see if there were any nyquil pills i can overdose on but there wasn‚Äôt any. for a split second after, i realized how fucking crazy that was so i decided to just facetime my cousin so it would stop and distract me from killing myself

it worked, bcuz obviously i‚Äôm still here but i felt guilty for having her see me like that, sobbing uncontrollably and not being able to breathe properly. which made me spiral more because i hate being a burden to my family. i ended up falling asleep eventually but now im awake, because i can never stay asleep throughout the night whenever i sleep early which is irritating. now im rlly wishing i did have those sleeping pills.

This comfort that you are looking for is on your own behalf. There's a desire inside that wants comfort for yourself and that desire is based on the fact that you care about yourself. If you didn't care then this wouldn't be bothering you but since it is bothering you, it seems you really care about yourself.

From what you‚Äôve said here, she clearly don‚Äôt validate your feelings on things so why do you care if she agrees with your assessment on things or not?  Also, if you don‚Äôt mind me asking, how old are you?  You said she ‚Äúforced‚Äù you to work an overnight job? Is there anyway you could save money and move out or find a roommate?

"Life is literally cause and effect.. so the past will influence the present. Stop telling people to stop blaming their parents if and when their parents are the ones responsible for creating the circumstances that was their past which is influencing how they are existing in the present. I have grown so fucking tired of people telling me to stop blaming my parents when my parents Behavior has laid the foundation for my past and their behavior and my present continues to influence my life. Telling me that I'm too old to blame them literally for what they've done doesn't make any sense. Nowhere else in the world do we tell people to not hold individuals accountable for what they've done in the past.. people only do that to adult children when it comes to their parents and it makes zero fucking sense.

My parents are the reason I look the way I look, my parents are the reason I think the way I think, my parents are the reason I've had the trauma responses that I have.. I could keep going on and on. Nowhere in blaming them am I expecting them to solve my problems.. that's not how life works. People create problems in your life and it's literally never going to be up to them to solve those problems. And in many instances they create problems for you that are not problems for them. So they couldn't solve something that they don't perceive as a problem. But that doesn't mean they aren't to blame."

Back in 2019, out of desperation to feel like I was a normal 20-something year old, I hooked up with the only person I could find who was interested in me and he gave me herpes (HSV1)

It doesn't matter how common HSV1 is in the form of coldsores, most people are disgusted by it and so ON TOP OF PEOPLE NOT LIKING MY GROSS FAT BODY, they see me as gross for having herpes so I will probably never have sex ever again.

"Man, I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre in such a low place.

"OP, people are hypocrites. There are far, and I mean far more people with herpes than you know of. Many, and I mean many just don't talk about it, or just take their medicine and don't say anything.

Being overweight and black can seem a double negative, as it goes against the sexual stereo types of black men and it also brings forth other stereotypes. I already know that people are going to treat you like shit or that you are lazy and stupid.


Then again, if you are black and obviously altheletic and strong, then they treat you as if you are either a sexual object  or just a criminal / scourge to society.

So what can you do?

Do what the old brothers have been doing for a long time.
Pick a character and stick to it. Dress casual formal, wear glasses and frames.
Be positive and uplifting in conversation. Try to cut down on your weight.

I hate to say this, but you have to remove as many negative assumptions that people could have about you. You will be judged on stereotypes and this will be done by people who claim that they support you. You are always ""on probation"".

I hate to be like this, but this is reality to me. I do the same things and I am doing well.

"It is OK to Not Want to have Herpes

Hi all, I‚Äôm a volunteer and patient advocate working with the only patient advocacy organization for herpes in the US, [Herpes Cure Advocacy.](https://www.herpescureadvocacy.com)

I wanted to post to share: It is 100% normal to not want this infection. It is your experience and your right to advocate for your own health. 

It is okay to ask questions like:

üî¨ Why isn‚Äôt there a cure or more effective treatments?

üì¢ Why is clinical care confusing and why are medical providers not better informed?

ü©ªWhat are (known or suspected) serious health impacts of having herpes? 

üí™üèºWhat can be done to advance Herpes cure, treatment and prevention efforts? 

I know many want to accept themselves and their diagnosis. But I wanted to share you can accept it, love yourself, and advocate for change at the same time.

You‚Äôre going to continue to be unemployed and having sleep issues and/or depression as long as you do nothing.  As far as weight, going for 20 minute then 30 minute walks three times a week is a start.  You won‚Äôt lose weight instantly but at least you are doing something to improve.  I do it (short power walks) and feel accomplished afterwards.  It‚Äôs a small step but it‚Äôs been great on my psyche.  Also, in your responses, you keep talking about lose skin well do you want to lose weight or not?  If not, you have to accept yourself and your body type where it is and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with loving your body as it is!!!  Start somewhere. It‚Äôs OK to vent but if you don‚Äôt take action to better your situation, you‚Äôll stay stuck.  It has to start with you.

"I admit that I am an extremely sensitive person and have always relied on external validation and acceptance. I hate being hated and rejected. I have pretty low self-esteem and confidence. I struggle a lot with rumination and obsession. I used to only struggle with not being able to let go of stuff that happened in real life and negative thoughts I have about myself, but I find that I ruminate over crap I've encountered online now.

Especially when it comes to bigotry. Like, I'm no stranger to racism. I experienced it growing up from other kids and I've seen it happen to my mom. Still, I tried to be optimistic but cautious. But on the internet, it so widespread and accepted. It bothers me when I see something racist get hundreds of upvotes and comments agreeing. It makes me think this is really how most people are. That the racism is the ""right"" view. I know there are people who aren't racist and many who speak up and challenge these people. But their voices just seem so feeble in comparison. 

I've tried seeking out black forums, but it just made me hyperaware of certain problems. Misogynoir sucks, it really does, but hearing about it all the time makes me depressed and reminds me how people hate me for existing. Same with the ""diaspora wars"" as someone deemed it. Non-black people and other black people alike seem to like to rub it in that Africans and Caribbeans don't like Black Americans. How they're supposedly so much better. They seem to think it justifies racism against Black Americans or something. 

Whenever the topic of mixed people come up, it's a mess. It seems like some people can't fathom that not all of us are half white and that some of us come from black moms. I get colorism and privilege and I don't object, but again, it's a reminder of how screwed everything is. Funnily enough, I don't like mixed forums because everything is black/white, they deny that there is any colorism or privilege and make it seem like black people are the problem. And for the most part, I can't relate to them.

Then there's the news. I hate crime stories. When the perp is black, there will be racism. Hell, there's racism when any story involves a black person, crime or no. It has come to a point where it makes me anxious and I kind of wish the media didn't report on black people at all, news or entertainment. I also hate how everything is politics. I get there are a lot of issues in society, I get that a lot of stuff is actually problematic, but it's tiring to feel the need to be aware of it 24/7. Especially when it's something I can't do anything about.

I know I need to take a break and I've deleted my twitter, instagram, limited my news intake, but I can't quit reddit, despite it being one of the biggest offenders. I can't just sit back and be happy because I am reminded how much people hate me because of ethnicity and gender, or some crime, or a problem in the community, which I feel are mostly the same problems that exist in the larger society... Perhaps just presented differently. I feel like I and ""us"" are the only ones who get shamed and guilted for it, we're all held responsible, and we are judged and boiled down to the ""bad"" parts of our culture but no one else is."		post	18.984112078627184	female	White	0.9981800317764282	na	na	na	5	BlackMentalHealth
You sound like a thoughtful kind person. You are going to have to remove some of the subs you look at and reduce the amount of news you look at. You can't keep putting stressful evil stuff in your face everyday and be healthy. Because of the former president racism more blatant these days. A lot of people are meaner because of the pandemic. A lot of people are behaving badly. Their nastiness has nothing to do with you. It's about who they are and what they are going through. Reddit was causing me distress a lot. I had to change up what I was looking at and make sure I didn't look at it right before bed. The racism doesn't hurt me anymore. It does piss me off and kind of amuses me at the same time. If a community uses violence, oppression and propaganda to hold other communities down then they truly can't be the best. Nothing is wrong with me. Their community has a foundation of hate and cruelty. I'm sorry I'm tired and my comment is all over the place.		reply	na	na	na	0.9981800317764282	weak	no	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"I, too, have been affected by social media. I completely understand. I don‚Äôt go on Instagram because I was comparing my life to everyone on there for no reason!! Helped me out a bit.

Same with politics, I only pay attention when voting comes around so I can pick the right candidate for me or some big legislation passes. Politics is so polarizing and depressing when there are people campaigning against your human rights

I also have been trying to step away from the Black forums across social media myself precisely for what you mentioned. It seems like it‚Äôs the same negative topics regurgitated again and again. Dating low vibrational people, inequality at work, bashing people for not being the ‚Äòright‚Äô kind of Black‚Ä¶. I think these topics are important esp if you‚Äôre unaware or looking for advice because you‚Äôre in a similar situation, but I‚Äôm already aware of how difficult the world is.

"I literally see gifts as just debt I never asked for, and unsolicited favors are loans. 

Long story short I've had so many experiences where family hung their gifts or help over my head and used it to guilt me into doing whatever for them... I became ashamed of receiving it. This was when I didn't have anything to give back. I didn't have the means to do for myself yet, and they expected my all, using ""well I did this for you"" or ""well I got you this"" as justification. When I couldn't give or do for them (no means to), I got ""you don't care about your family, you only care about yourself"" . 
 
How do I know if someone is coming from the heart? 

Everytime anyone offers a thing, I feel guilty.  I feel like I don't deserve it. I hear my folks calling me selfish.

I hate this time of year because of it

"I have been having this question lingering in my head for so many years. Though I do plan to go to therapy to fix some issues about myself to regulate myself around social settings and groups.

I always question why we should attend therapy, and why it's beneficial to ourselves and beneficial to the people around us? 

A couple of theories I have in my head are sometimes your friends and family are not your therapist. They are just support and you can't always drown them with all the issues and psychological difficulties you might be having with your mental state.

Another one is that it's not their responsibility to take care of the mental problems that we all carry. Not everyone can really be burdened with your troubles and walls, if I'm not mistaken.

Another one is that if I don't go into therapy, I'm unsafe to be around anyone in a working environment, friendly environment, and even in a social environment.

Which sometimes makes me think that I'm supposed to be happy and okay all the time. In reality, I'm not. But I have to figure out ways to cope and accept the things that I can't change and move on with the reality that I've been given.

If any of this make any sense to you all. Can you share with me your opinions on why it's best to go to therapy and what is it for really?"	MISTAX1995	post	43.817748633475105	female	White	0.009296094067394733	na	na	na	5	BlackMentalHealth
"Yes, absolutely. I'm happy to share my experience. I've been in therapy pretty regularly for about 15 years, and I've benefited immensely from it. The main diagnoses I'm currently using it to manage/support with are Bipolar 1 and PTSD. I've been seeing my current therapist for over 5 years; she's white, but we have a great relationship and I trust her completely, she's very good at what she does, I feel really safe with her, and we work well together. She's stewarded me through some ROUGH times and celebrated some big successes with me.

First, I think it's really great that you have a level of self-awareness to sort out that there are different roles for different people in your life to play, and that not everybody is equipped to fit every role. There are things in our lives that our family and friends are not equipped to handle, not because we are ""too much"" or ""too broken,"" but because they're...just not experts at it. You don't necessarily want your dad building you a new addition to your house, y'know? He may mean well, but if he doesn't have the tools, the training, the knowledge of building codes, he shouldn't just drive down to the hardware store and start knocking down your walls. Same with therapy. We have needs, we should have our needs met in a healthy way that empowers and enables us to live healthy and fulfilling lives, and sometimes the folks around us don't have the tools and skills to generate the supports necessary. We are houses unto ourselves, and that gorgeous reading nook that we need to retreat to when we heed to de-stress isn't going to build itself.

Second, you are correct in realizing that we are not supposed to be happy and okay all the time. Nobody can do that. Nobody. And I agree that building skills to cope and accept is a fantastic goal. Therapy is a great way to do that. A therapist can be like a coach, in a lot of ways. They can kind of assess your ""form"" for how you move through life and process things, and then help you tighten up your game with skills and techniques and exercises. There are *lots* of methodologies for this, and your therapist can help you explore what's right for you. 

If you have some ideas to start with, based on things you know are a struggle or a value for you, it can help you search for the right match. For me, I know I need someone with trauma expertise, who is gender-affirming/LGBTQ-supportive, and I'm not a fan of the CBT (cognitive-behavioral therapy) approach. But if you're not sure, sometimes you can call and ask the front desk, or look up providers on their website and Google the credentials and specialties they list and see if it sounds like a match.

But yeah, a lot of it is about skill-building, and if you enter it with a goal-oriented mindset, and communicate that, you can work with your therapist to build a plan, and keep coming back to it to make sure you're on track. And if things happen that knock you off track, you can address those together (postpartum depression took me WAAAYYY off-track), and move forward as needed. But keep in mind that, while it can feel very personal, it's also a business relationship, and if you're not getting what you need, and if you don't feel safe/respected, you can just bounce. 

In my experience, though, with a combination of therapy and medication, I've come to a place where I feel really good about myself as a person, and I generally feel pretty optimistic about the future, even when I'm feeling depressed. I still have depressive spells, due to the Bipolar, and just because shit happens in life. But when I'm sitting there feeling like everything sucks and I hate everyone and everything, part of me, down in the center, still says, ""Meh. This'll pass. Something good will happen again, one day."" And that's the goal, I think. Not to be happy all the time, but to have a stable core of resilience that helps you not just deal with the bad times, but heal afterwards.

"I realized I needed therapy a few years ago and took the leap. I thought therapy was for people with severe mental issues, but it‚Äôs far from that. It‚Äôs been a great decision, and I‚Äôm glad I put my pride aside and went. It benefits me because I can hear another perspective that‚Äôs honest and not bias, and it helped me find closure to some of my traumas. It also made me analyze my actions more, and realize when the times when I‚Äôm at fault. It‚Äôs an unraveling type of experience since you start with one thing and continue to peel back the layers until you identify the core of the problem. 

We can all benefit from therapy since we all have our issues. As life goes on the possibility of traumas increase, and we have to let them out one way or another.

Also to anyone currently suicidal‚Ä¶.Based on my own experience I would advise you to try not to act on a momentary feeling. Wait it out for as long as you can and see if it passes. seek help first. If you don‚Äôt have a therapist or friends/family to talk to then try posting about your situation in supportive online groups. Sometimes other people can help give you a different perspective.

I think it's a real thing that needs to be treated, and that the thoughts don't really stop, you just get better at dealing with it.

"It is selfish. Sometimes it can be a phase. Sometimes it can be a reoccurring thought over years. Sometimes the ideation is a constant companion for decades.

But like, I don't think selfishness is inherently bad. People should put themselves first, that's healthy. It's unhealthy when they cease to consider anyone else ever to prioritize their selfishness. But I think pure selflessness is just as damaging as pure selfishness. Balance is important, and we shouldn't place shame for the existence of either emotional state. At least, we can't just leave it at that. I feel like all to often people just label suicide as selfish and leave it at that.

Even if it is a phase? I don't think that diminishes the severity of seriousness. I think people who try and write it off as a phase are just trying to justify their own unwillingness to get involved.

Their experiences with someone of a larger size was more disappointing or average due to the man's selfishness, being too big, or a heavy reliance on size vs. attentiveness/ability to navigate. Most women would rather have someone kind and considerate, size isn't an issue.

 Bigger isn't better yet I find men usually more preoccupied with the idea of size than women. And out of the women who I know who think that, they are usually (A) fetishizing or (B) getting low quality experiences that lack emotional depth and relying on size as bragging rights. If I remember correctly, most women lose feeling beyond 4.5 inches (depth of canal), anyway."	Ordinary-Research-42	reply	na	na	na	0.006608927622437477	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

" Well, helloüëãüèΩ 

 I‚Äôve definitely been there before! I‚Äôm sure more people have too. And, if you‚Äôre questioning this because you‚Äôre not sure you like your therapist (but, even if you‚Äôre not) you can go over some problems you keep coming back to (or tracing stuff back to) and see what you‚Äôve learned/any progress you‚Äôve made on your own. If you feel comfortable with your therapist, but sort of stagnant-go over it with your therapist. They‚Äôll probably tell you somethings they have seen change, and tell you growth isn‚Äôt linear, and you might get some ideas/recognize some accomplishments too. 

 Another thing I‚Äôve noticed, is I didn‚Äôt think I was gonna do much better with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Luckily, though I have yet to get it, there is Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT)! It‚Äôs group therapy, and may be also individual counseling, and that seems good for me.

"Trigger warning! 22 yr old (F) sorry in advance this is a long story but I needed to vent. I need advice on this situation, it‚Äôs driving me insane. I‚Äôve always been a very soft spoken girl. I stayed out of trouble. I‚Äôve had a pretty rough life, an abusive mother as a child, constantly being SA at a young age finding the body my grandmother/ the woman who raised me, dead after committing suicide, after a week of being gone. Being adopted by a very hateful couple that caused me so much more mental pain etc etc. I was diagnosed with PTSD AND BPD all before the age of 15. My mental health had took over my life to the point it was hard to function my late teen years and yearly 20s. My mental health caused me to give up on all my dreams and goals. Dropping out of college. I went from relationship to relationship and ended up with my child‚Äôs father. He was really abusive and aggressive. Beat me My entire pregnancy. I made the executive decision to leave him but was shamed by my family because I was so willing to be a single mother over making it work with an abusive narcissist. My child was temporarily taken for 6 months bc of the abuse her father put us through after I had her. He ended up going to prison but within that time my family completely cut me off. I was receiving no help no government assistance. Kept getting declined for any-type of daycare assistance or food stamps, so it was hard to hold a job or take care of my little one. I figured that the cps workers would have helped me out with signing up for government assistant programs before I got my baby back but I was wrong. Going from home to home with my child. I slipped into a really bad depressive state. my adoptive parents had reached out and tried to make well with me. I decided to pack up and move out there with them again expecting to have some form of child care so I can work. I immediately regretted that decision. My adoptive mom started bringing up old drama and issues and started critiquing my parenting skills. Saying I was a crappy mom and I would end up like my grandma if I don‚Äôt get mental help I needed. She convinced me to go the ER. And tell them I was suicidal and I‚Äôve been having issues with my ptsd. Which I did. They put me in a mental health clinic as inpatient. During the stay I kept having ptsd attacks where I would go in out of what was reality and what was the past. The staff got pretty annoyed with me quickly. They would constantly send this man in my room to give me these shots in my bum to temporarily make my body stiff and make me sleepy. One day I was in the restroom of my room crying because it was mothers day and I couldn‚Äôt see my little baby . I heard a loud bang and I was locked in a tiny restroom. I started to hyperventilate bc I am severely cluster-phobic. My anxiety got so bad I was locked in there for 2 hours. Eventually they let me out. I was teased and laughed at by the staff. Which set off a PTSD attack. All I remember is being dragged by my foot by one of the staff members.
Next thing you know, I‚Äôm strapped into a restraint chair, and the cops had been called. I was confused on why the cops where there but I complied. I was taken to jail. stripped naked, locked haircut out of my head. And thrown in a padded room. They eventually brought me out to take a mug shot picture. I constantly asked within 24 hours If I can make a phone call and why I was there they declined me any info and help. I was also on my monthly cycle, I asked for feminine products and I was declined. I ended up spending two weeks in the padded room. I was eventually moved into general population in general population with me being in there for a week I had gotten beaten up and had all of my jail given commissary stolen. They move me into solitary confinement, where I only had an hour a day to come out of my room to shower, or to make a phone call. I tried calling my adoptive mother. To check on my child and my number had been blocked. Within this time period of me moving into solitary an officer had told me that he‚Äôs heard about me and that I‚Äôm not gonna run him over and I‚Äôm not gonna control anything I was confused. he would be extremely rough on me when he would allow me to come out of my room to the point where I was assaulted by him, which  when I told the corporal, and he denied and said that I was making it up and that he‚Äôs going to put me back in a padded room, which I started crying and begging him not to so he put me on suicide watch in the padded room. Keep in mind the padded room doesn‚Äôt have a toilet doesn‚Äôt have a sink doesn‚Äôt have anything but a hole in the floor where you have to pee and poo. After being locked up for 3 to 4 months, my mom finally found out where I was after not being able to contact me and immediately bailed me out. She found the location of my child and got her. My mom thinks my adoptive mom was trying to set me up for failure so she can take my child since she can‚Äôt have any kids. My mom always had this rule. If you get in trouble, you have to deal with the consequences. But she knew deep down in her heart that I didn‚Äôt do anything like the woman claimed that I did. Hence why she came and bailed me out. I‚Äôve never gotten in trouble in my life. I didn‚Äôt know my charges, and I didn‚Äôt know what the woman had said that I did until after I was released from jail, they have pending charges for me for 3rd degree felony assault on a ER personnel. since I‚Äôve been released my attorney has not answered the phone. I‚Äôve called him over 600 times in the past few months. My mom has even called him. The Bail Bonds woman has called him and we always get his assistant telling us that he‚Äôs not in office and that she will leave a message for him and I‚Äôve never gotten a call back. I was released in June. It is now November and I still haven‚Äôt heard anything from him. I‚Äôm at the point now where I‚Äôm scared to get any more mental help. Because clearly I‚Äôm too far gone. If I can‚Äôt remember what happened that day. Nobody‚Äôs going to want to help me with this on my record so many people said that this whole situation was wrong because they arrested a mental patient for being mental, but at the same time the situation has made my mental health 500 times worse. I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do if my charges go through and I have to go to prison."	Depressedloverkidd	post	24.524925911528793	female	White	0.9955779314041138	na	na	na	3	BlackMentalHealth

"  So, stuff with my sibling has been escalating. We were suppose to be roommates, but also saving up and working (among other things) for when we have to start paying rent. I also required them to do something about their not good mental health. They didn‚Äôt, the weren‚Äôt working or listening‚Ä¶ They were triggering the fuck out of me-acting like the worse parts of our parents AND THEY WEREN‚ÄôT WORKING (on ANYTHING)! 

  I would try different approaches, largely talking (sometime with as little emotion as I could as I think they have undiagnosed BPD) to them about issues. Somethings improved, but overall it felt like I was living directly with one or both of my parents again. But, they depended on me and other people for things! Then stuff started to escalate‚Ä¶ whenever we get into disagreements lately, they would start moving towards me and getting louder-clearly trying to punk me/threaten me. 

 They brought home three Guinea pigs-from someone who shouldn‚Äôt be allowed any pets. And, like a lot of things, we agreed to do some stuff to address it (like what is required to take care of Guinea Pigs). But, they didn‚Äôt actually wanna do that. They wanted to lie, as they often do, and talk about how the Guinea pigs are theirs anyways. 


  Also, outside of squaring up, they‚Äôll try to say real hurtful things. Mock me, insult me, belittle me,etc. Today‚Äôs was about my recent faulty relationship with a guy. It was a bunch of back and forth.. needless. I feel bad, and I‚Äôm questioning my decisions. But, they weren‚Äôt treating me well. It made stuff harder than it was.

"I made the mistake of reading the comments on the news story and getting into an argument with some users on here. I hate all these not-so subtle bigoted hottakes on ""black culture,"" rap, gangs, and violence. Of course, access to guns cannot even be partially blamed. Sure, it's not the only reason, but gun culture is an argument reserved for white victims only. 

They've somehow managed to whitewash guns and violence... The poor black man who grew up in the innercity views on guns and his access to them is not analyzed unless it's to show how much of ruthless thug he is. Gangs and guns go hand in hand in the US, but people try to separate them because guns are for white conservative men, and he is never violent. His pathologies never discussed, unless by those lying liberals.

Maybe my views are wrong, perhaps I am naive, but I just see a man murdered by another man over some BS. Take away his fame, the rap, his color, and that's what it is. It's a shame. If you want to take it as anything, let it be a lesson on how you live your life. How we live or who we associate with can lead to our downfall.

But what it isn't is some reflection of the culture of Black Americans. A statement on how inferior they are, and why people are justified in hating them. Most of us aren't even rappers. Heck, I barely listen to rap and I wasn't even a fan of Migos. I'm not responsible for their actions, or the killers, or gangs, or anyone else's. And there's nothing I or anyone (except those who were there) could've done to prevented it. 

Oh, and if the fans are to blame for buying music that ""glorifies violence,"" then white Americans are to blame too. They didn't become best-selling artists or rap one of the biggest genres in the world solely by Black Americans listening it."		post	17.81964364502348	male	White	0.9980308413505554	na	na	na	8	BlackMentalHealth

But the trap rap glorifying violence, drugs, partner stealing and slut life has gotten old. Just like Gospel music is outdated and useless. Yet I‚Äôm still familiar with how to separate the lines and help others try and do the same. I‚Äôm from a pre-gentrified city and ran the streets like a thug. Also, been involved with the music industry for some time now. It‚Äôs what us conscientious folks are trying to show is what‚Äôs getting lost in the mix. 

Now for our community and leadership we need to separate and come back together when our people decide that we don‚Äôt need anyone else like we were taught as a country. Reparations would help and our own political parties. In the meantime we have to do it small groups at a time. Plus go to and create our own apps, connect well with indifferences, and bring our capital and understandings as one. Those who are biracial will have a hard time with this and white god religious folk. But it starts with us and our friends and family."		follow-up	na	na	na	0.9980308413505554	weak	no	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"This is easily the best black community on this site. I've only had this account for a few months but I've been on and off reddit since 2011 (think f7u12 era). I misunderstood the spaces that we occupy on the internet. They aren't really that positive and they acted as fuel for insecurities I have from my past. In particular, just feeling like I'm not black enough and also feeling that I'll never be enough of a man because I'm black. The scathing things that black women have to say about black men is heartbreaking. I understand it comes from a place of real trauma and experiences that obviously don't involve me in any capacity. But, being born to a black woman (both of parents are black) that constantly belittled me for being too dark and hails my much lighter sister and her white partner as being better hurts more than I can explain. Crazy because I fail to understand how white men are better other than the fact that they're white and can offer that privilege to them. I learned that I'll never be good enough for my mother or the world because of my skin and there's nothing I can do about it. Seeing subs like blackladies and them hailing their white partners brings these huge insecurities to the surface. I feel like I'm to blame somehow. Like this is my fault for being born black and it's something I just have to live with. I think seeing those women speak that way about white men reminds me that I'll never be good enough for my mother and probably anyone. That I'll have to find someone willing to *deal with* my blackness instead of loving it.

Maybe I'm just chronically online and I need to touch grass. Who knows. I'm horribly insecure. This is more of a vent/rant than anything. I've probably been spending too much time on social media. I'll probably take another break after this post.

Edit: I can't tell you how grateful I am for the support. Thank you so much to everyone for these kind and understanding words. I was worried it would come off as hateful/spiteful.

As a black woman, I‚Äôd like to give you a few encouraging words‚Ä¶ there is nothing wrong with the color of your skin.

 I mean to say that 1. Your observations are valid. 2. When I find myself struggling with things that I *know* are true/untrue but I'm still hurting from them nonetheless - it's time for a break. It seems like you know that these things come from hurts that you didn't cause. I hope you know that in the whole wide world people are able & waiting to love (not just tolerate) your Blackness. 

I try to break things into what I can and what I can't impact. You *can* try to surround yourself with more positive messages about Black Men, Melanated skin, healthy love/relationships among Black ppl. 

You can't (singlehandedly) erase those stereotypes and traumas. In your family or in those groups.

You *can* try to heal the hurt from your interactions with your family. That can start just within you, privately for now. You may never take it to them or you might with time.

Black people as a collective are dealing with the same issue in different ways. Black women are dealing with being shunned by Black men by dating others. Black men are dealing with a lot of the treatment you‚Äôve faced by taking it out on Black women. 

People will love you, you are every bit as much of a man, and you don‚Äôt have to prove your manhood to anyone. Your mom is parroting what she was taught and placing her insecurities on you.

"Dude, it's literally heartbreaking to hear your story. I had a mother who hated the black side of my family too (even though she is black herself) she tried her hardest to keep me away from the culture (and gave in to the whole Christian religion hard). You may go through episodes of self-doubt and in my case, it can be crippling. Everyone calls me brilliant but no one wants to be with me so life is alone (but not necessarily always lonely).

"I'm not really sure where to start. Recently I got a call from my mother and she was having what I can only describe as a nervous breakdown. She was wailing and my sister was screaming at her to try to get her to stop. I raced to her house where she and my sister (age 22) leave together. She hadn't been able to stop crying and I made it worse because I got into it with my sister when I got there because of how disrespectful I think she is to my mother. My sister told me she's always hated me because of how poorly I treat her and how judgemental I am with her. She feels persecuted in the house, which in hindsight is completely valid. She has a personality that comes off as very aggressive and rude. And its definitely hard to ""hear"" her or not make her the ""villain"" in a lot of situations. My mother is not perfect either but with time and distance (I'm in my 40s and I moved out when I was 25 or so.) I have learned to understand her. I also probably put her on a pedestal he doesn't deserve to be on. She loses her temper often and she is prone to lashing out and being pigheaded. I feel like when I think of her I don't really remember those times I just remember the supportive moment. That being the case when I see my sister lash out at her (like I myself did way back in the day) all I see is someone being cruel to my sainted mother. I can acknowledge thats not fair.

At the same time there are no true martyrs here. My sister as I have said, is a lot. She's petty, aggressive, rude and very self-centered (even for a 20year old). I impatient with people and my knee jerk reaction to conflict is to run from it. (Something I'm working on.) My fear is that there's no way back to sanity. My sister is so biased (understandably so) to us that I dont think she can ""hear"" us at all. I know we'll never be a tv show family, I just wish we could be around each other without screaming all the time."

None of us at this stage in life have made to the next realm at least somewhat unscathed and that‚Äôs ok. Not because it was supposed to happen in a way. But because it just happened.

Some helpful tips/reminders:

Drink water regularly, take wellness supplements, take proper dosages of prescription meds, get some sun, go for walks, better sleep habits, create a journal, find an art form, learn to meditate, breathing techniques, find & create words of affirmations, listen to enjoyable music, serve those of us who are in need, allow yourself to be loved, release endorphins, know that your melanin is a gift to be protected and cherished, don‚Äôt self-hate, keep it real but don‚Äôt complain don‚Äôt self-mutilate, and be ok with being imperfect.

"Last night I basically cried myself to sleep. I think I‚Äôve been holding it in for too long, I pretend I‚Äôm okay but I‚Äôm really not. I grew up with anxiety and depression but once I moved out, things got better. I take meds and I‚Äôm in therapy. My dad is a narcissist and he also has a drug/alcohol abuse problem. 

At one point I‚Äôve thought about doing an intervention to bring this to his attention but I can be honest with myself and know that if it backfires, I won‚Äôt be able to handle it mentally. I don‚Äôt want him to think I‚Äôm tryna put his business out and then he‚Äôs just mad at me. I was thinking about getting someone from church who I know he‚Äôs close with (he‚Äôs a minister) so you can see why that would be very hard on me. 

He‚Äôs gotten so worse with alcohol and drugs..it used to be marijuana but I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs something else too because his face has gotten skinnier. His personality has changed and every other word is a curse word, I‚Äôve never ever heard him talk like this until literally yesterday. What makes it worse is my little sister still lives with him (I‚Äôm there for her whenever she needs me) and like I worry something bad is going to happen to him and I can‚Äôt do NOTHING whatsoever. He won‚Äôt go to therapy because he don‚Äôt think anything is wrong. I know my dad‚Äôs siblings died around the same age he is because of alcohol/drugs. 

I‚Äôm scared and I don‚Äôt know who my dad is anymore. I wish I could do something, I miss my daddy when I didn‚Äôt know the real him sometimes and I just wish he could‚Äôve been loved correctly growing up..

Sometimes I have these fascinations about how I would end it all and wanting to just completely rest in the dark until I no longer wake up. Sometimes being in an endless loop like a dream. Like a dream of jumping in the void and just floating with many particles around me.

While most people say it's selfish and inconsiderate of everyone else. I come to think of it as a blessing and a release to just not be a burden or some type of hindrance in someone's life. I just don't want to feel like I'm some type of causality and everyone's life so far.

Everyday I feel like I'm not achieving my goals or not prospering in certain aspects. I even feel like at any moment, I could be abandoned or forgotten by the people I love because they changed directions and didn't think I was enough to be around their company.

"Hey former trauma researcher here.

First off, I want you to think of depression like being in an abusive relationship with yourself. You ever hear how abusers talk to their partners? They say they‚Äôre worthless, they‚Äôll never be good enough, no one will ever love you etc. depression tries to isolate you from your friends and‚Äôs family like abusers too. Don‚Äôt let it. 

Secondly, it‚Äôs not necessarily the selfishness of the act but the hole you will leave in others lives will be more devastating than you know. There‚Äôs plenty of heartbreaking stories on Reddit from loved ones that I think you should read. I know you‚Äôll think,*But I can‚Äôt live just for them, I‚Äôm suffering*. You‚Äôll still regret it. There‚Äôs a documentary about a guy who survives jumping off the golden state bridge on YouTube I think. I‚Äôve only seen a preview but the most chilling words he said were the moment he jumped and was at the point of no return he regretted it. He said all his worries suddenly seemed fixable. He wanted to live but he was watching himself die instead. I think watching that would give you some perspective. 

Lastly, and I say this with all hesitancy, I‚Äôve seen what happens when people survive. In every way imaginable. We had a nurse overdose because he couldn‚Äôt handle the stress of all the pandemic patients dying. He‚Äôs awake and alert. He‚Äôll track movement with his eyes. But his brain was without oxygen for too long and he isn‚Äôt able to communicate or swallow properly. He has seizures. He makes repetitive motions randomly, he has a colostomy/urine bag. His reflexes don‚Äôt work so it‚Äôs unclear if he‚Äôs in pain. What prevented me was the surviving gunshot wounds. No matter where you point it, a shaking hand or not calculating where the gun will be when you move to press the trigger‚Ä¶you can survive one. Sometimes not for long. Sometimes for years to come. 

What I‚Äôve seen work is to give your pain a passion or a purpose. People go through traumatic events or difficult times and become advocates for others going through the same.

"You‚Äôre doing your best. And you‚Äôre an amazing mama. Your body is working to do exactly what you came here with the ability to do. 

Your first moment of existence was in your grandmother‚Äôs womb, it was there that a little more than half of your body was created with and as a part of your mother. 

The same is true of your baby. That child was a long time coming, and comes here with purpose. 

The fact of the matter is that you are in a hostile environment. You struggle internally as well as externally and you face extenuating circumstances that are all the more frightening IN such an environment. None of that is anywhere near easy. 

I encourage you to surround and continue surrounding yourself with people you feel your spirit to be aligned with, fill your space with those you trust to act in your best interest if you require additional medical interventions during labor, doctors who give you a good feeling in your gut, who your intuition guides you towards and not away from. 

Take your time every day to CLAIM your blessings and call to you a care team who will be attuned to your needs and who will generate good energy around your birth as you go through this rite of passage and who hold it sacred. Who hold *you* sacred.

If you find yourself becoming overwhelmed, go out in that grass and put your feet in it, take your shoes off. Let that energy stabilize and fill you.

"For me it has happened two times. One I was cool with for awhile, but used/manipulated me and I narrowed contact for a long time after getting some not great feelings about him, only to find out he did something pretty bad to someone close to me. My second friend(strictly platonic) was a girl, and while I made some mistakes it ultimately led to a one sided cutting of ties and some harsh words when I tried to prevent her from doing something dangerous. They are both quite complicated to get into but point is even at 22 the loss of these relationships weigh on my heart today. 

 Plus I am autistic so my social skills were pretty shitty in my formative years and friendships much harder. I have a few friends now even if we don't talk often but these past ones still weigh alot on my self esteem and I consider my biggest regrets.

it be like that. people come and go in your 20‚Äôs. it‚Äôs normal to mourn the loss of a relationship platonic or not but the whole point of friendship is to feel supported and loved. if they don‚Äôt do there‚Äôs no point in being around them.

"i‚Äôve talked abt a ‚Äúsituationship‚Äù i was in a couple times on here, dealing w this bullshit for damn near the whole year has truly been debilitating to say the least. my year would have been so much more satisfactory if i wasn‚Äôt consumed by him for most of it. because he strung me along. this morning i asked him the simple question ‚Äúwe‚Äôre friends right ?‚Äù to which he responded, and i quote 
‚ÄúYES ? lmfao, why ?‚Äù  although i was relieved to get a straight answer, my heart still plummeted bcuz he answered that like it was supposed to be an obvious answer. and what the fuck was so funny that he felt the need to say ‚Äúlmfao‚Äù ??? 

to reiterate, it wasn‚Äôt an obvious answer because when i felt like we were growing apart and tried to end things in june HE was the one who insisted we didn‚Äôt and then proceeded to tell me his absence was because he was ‚Äúgoing through shit.‚Äù so what did i do ? first, i felt horrible for even trying to put myself first by removing myself from a situation that was hurting me & then i proceeded to stick by him because i felt he needed moral support. but that wasn‚Äôt the case at all, i tried being there for him & he still continued to shut me out. so what the fuck was i even there for ????

so from june to now (and even before then) i‚Äôve been losing my fuckin mind over this man, tryna play a guessing game like ‚Äúdoes he even still love me ?‚Äù i knew in the back of mind he didn‚Äôt cuz all the signs were there but i had doubt because he was tellin me otherwise.
when i tried to speak up he‚Äôd tell me ‚Äúi‚Äôm thinking too much into it‚Äù or i‚Äôm overthinking like ??? he made me feel like my suspicions were invalid when clearly they weren‚Äôt. 

it makes me wonder if he was lying abt talking to my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù (we‚Äôre not close but we‚Äôre friendly acquaintances) a few months back, she was talkin on her close friends story abt how she tried talking to one of her ‚Äúold yeahs‚Äù again but it backfired blah blah, and ian pay any mind to it until she implied that she was referring to a jamaican boy 
( the boy i‚Äôve been fuckin w is jamaican üôÉ) 
i‚Äôm of jamaican descent, so if any other jamaicans happen to be reading this, just know all i kept hearing in back of my head was ‚Äúbun ! bun ! bun!‚Äù lol

and guess what ?? he used to talk to her briefly in the beginning around the time he met me (we all met around the same time)  but they stopped talking bcuz he thought ‚Äúshe was weird and overstepped his boundaries‚Äù 
so forgiveeeee me, for suspecting she was taking abt ‚Äúmy man‚Äù bcuz yea, the possibilities were not low. but when i asked him abt it he was defensive & denied, then proceeded to show me ‚Äúproof‚Äù 
but now i‚Äôm wondering if i should go & ask her if she was talkin bout him since this shit is over now. 

anyways, so back to today. like i said his response gave me relief but i‚Äôm also most likely finna have some sort of breakdown or sumn because as i was pondering on his response, my heart was in my stomach and i was uncontrollably shaking because it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶
all these months i was put through hell all because he couldn‚Äôt be transparent w me from the beginning and led me along to suffer in silence. when this all could‚Äôve been over in june. 

what sucks is i feel used. bcuz like i said in another post, i JUST bought him SAT books for college so it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶why would he feel comfortable taking money from me, knowing our status is not the same as it was & also not making that clear to me ??

ppl take from me until i feel drained and i let it happen because i believe i‚Äôm doin it out of love. when rlly it‚Äôs my severe codependency issues. my friend asked me a simple, yet valid question abt 2 months ago.
‚Äúwhat has he done for you ?‚Äù the answer is fucking nothing. and i knew that, but i accepted it because all i wanted was his love. but i didn‚Äôt even get that so‚Ä¶jokes on me lol. play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

meanwhile, i wrote 3 college essays for him
(that got him accepted to all the schools he applied for) BUT HE DIDNT FUCKIN GO. why ? because the scholarship money wasn‚Äôt enough. which is fine but it‚Äôs like i rlly set my own personal work aside and stressed out over completing them essays in a limited time, all for nothing. i also tried mailing him a book he wanted that he initially recommended me the first night we spoke. it didn‚Äôt work cuz mailing to jamaica is a bitch but regardless, i tried mailing twice so that‚Äôs double the amount of money down the drain. i gave him nothing but love, support, and respect all for him to play w me like a toy until he got bored.  

he also wrote me a long ass paragraph for my birthday in april, talkin abt how much he loved me and all that crap. i knew in the back of mind it was bullshit because even prior to that i had noticed him distancing from me, so he rlly pulled all them words out his ass. which hurts like shit because why would u put that much effort in, to lie ? 

i‚Äôm relieved it‚Äôs over but obviously it‚Äôs agonizing. because i already have low self esteem, and think of myself as worthless sometimes but it hurts when ppl treat me like shit because even i know i don‚Äôt deserve it. all i ever do is love and appreciate the ppl close to me, even if it may be to an excessive extent i never go out of my way to hurt ppl. so why do ppl feel comfortable doing it to me ? 

what have i learned ? to trust absolutely no one. all i ever rlly have is myself. and i never want to be in any form of a romantic relationship again. i know this wasn‚Äôt even real bcuz we‚Äôre young & it was long distance. but i got a taste of it and i‚Äôm soooo good off all this shit. i never wanted it to begin with. i‚Äôve learned that men will break your heart with no fuckin remorse and i can‚Äôt deal w it. (not saying this only applies to men, but that‚Äôs just who i‚Äôve dealt with so far) 

this shit ruined me, because now im looking at my male friend sideways cuz it‚Äôs like can i even rlly trust him ??? i don‚Äôt wanna feel that way towards him, he‚Äôs the only one who‚Äôs been consistent and good to me for the 2 years i‚Äôve known him but now my trust in ppl is entirely diminished. 

but after all of this‚Ä¶.i‚Äôm probably still gonna be friends w him, or cordial. it‚Äôll probably hurt less in the long run to be friends rather than partners cuz i‚Äôve already started changing the way i speak to him into a more friendly way rather than romantic, to avoid being hurt or surprised when this time came. 
plus he just told me sumn abt his new internship, and i‚Äôm rlly happy for him because he talked abt wanting to do this since the first day we met so to see it coming into fruition makes me so proud of him.

"Queer, leftist black sheep of the family (no pun intended)

The white folk in my area have ultimately been more accepting of my sexuality/gender nonconformity and politics by far. Unfortunately our community has a lot of hangups on sex,religion, politics etc that make deviation from the norm/accepted get met with hostility. ""It's a phase"" ""Pray on it"" ""depress them dishes"" ""so you're a girl that wants to look like a guy but still be a girl?"" ""You have a roof over your head what do you got to be depressed about"" etc etc

 But white folks, bless their heart but they cannot possibly see these things through the lens of the Black experience. So while they accept the facets of us that aren't readily accepted and understood by the black community, they can't replicate the sense of community that being a black American creates.

I want to get her into therapy (I‚Äôm in it for my depression, I highly recommend it) but all the therapist in my area are white guys.

Is there a directory somewhere? Insurance isn‚Äôt an issue for me cause I‚Äôll pay any price to get her help.

"i don‚Äôt know where to begin, my thoughts are all over the place. i‚Äôm just exhausted. i‚Äôm tired of putting my all into someone only for it to drain me of everything; my happiness, sanity, self worth, tranquility, self respect, independence, etc. 

i don‚Äôt know who i am outside of other ppl. 
i never have known.  i‚Äôve been incessantly running around like a headless chicken waiting for the next person to leech onto. 

i never genuinely desired having ‚Äúromantic‚Äù relationships w anyone. i was already burdened w my existing friendships to even want to be bothered w something of a higher level. but it happened anyways, and it‚Äôs been hell wrapped in a bow. the only person getting hurt is me, & he don‚Äôt got a 
 clue abt the suffering i‚Äôve endured for damn near this entire year. i love him, but my year wouldn‚Äôt be as fucked for me mentally if he hadn‚Äôt slipped into my life. but i just have to sit back and pretend like everything is calm bcuz i know in most instances i‚Äôm over reacting, but on his part he could‚Äôve went abt things better in a way that wouldn‚Äôt destroy me.

i literally just want him to be straight forward and not waste both our time. he wanted me initially, then he started to drift away so i asked him why, he gave me a ‚Äúvalid‚Äù excuse. 
the drifting continued to where i felt like maybe he just done w me but was tryna spare my feelings so i tried to remove myself, but he insisted against it & told me he was going through shit so i stayed so i could be there for him but he still continued shutting me out.

after that, i feel like he don‚Äôt necessarily hate me but he definitely doesn‚Äôt like me like he used to. we‚Äôre not on ‚Äúbad terms‚Äù i just bought him SAT books the other day because his financial situation ain‚Äôt the greatest. i was happy to do that for him even if he doesn‚Äôt like me like that anymore. i just wish he would be transparent because it‚Äôs killing me tryna decipher some nonexistent code.

and another thing- it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶if he rlly don‚Äôt like me no more, it‚Äôs kinda crazy that he‚Äôd feel comfortable enough taking money from me without letting me know straight up. cuz i‚Äôd feel more comfortable if it was clearly established that we just gon be cordial.

i‚Äôm scared to bring it up and talk abt this w him because every time i tried speaking up, he made me feel like i was overthinking when rlly i just want clear, unfiltered, answers. i‚Äôm tired of playing a guessing game.

i hate that i‚Äôm like this. i hate that i find my ‚Äúself worth‚Äù in other ppl. my entire existence i‚Äôve just been fucking up , i don‚Äôt even wanna know how much worse it could get in the future. i just want to dissipate."	wermpiss	post	18.978419249535808	female	White	0.9982238411903381	na	na	na	6	BlackMentalHealth

"M30. I really need a genuine friend. Someone to just chill with, vent to, smoke with. Everyday, all day, all I do is work. My only human interaction is when I'm at work so you can probably guess that all the ""conversations"" I have with others on a daily basis is about said work. As a child into my late teens I was constantly abused physically, mentally, verbally, & sexually. I was always told that family is all you have but every single family member I turned to either completely dismissed me and what I had to say or somehow it was my fault it happened.. now as an adult I have this habit to apologize or say ""my bad"" even if I know it wasn't my fault. It also fucked up my trust in people and as a result I've never had an honest relationship. I've had a lot of sex just never an actual relationship. I always have this voice in my head tellin me to question everything and trust no one. My last relationship (never official, so more like a fu*k buddy) lasted 3 years but ultimately ended because I could never fully trust the person. Everyday I wake up alone, eat alone, chill alone..my last ""best friend"" moved outta state and I was so happy for her but then she just stopped answering my texts & calls. After trying so many times to reach out I just gave up. I feel like ever since my twin took his life I'm just alone against the world..I tried talkin to my mom but she told me ""can't you just go to therapy?"" All while knowing that I'm raising 3 boys that aren't mine cuz their parents are shitty, also giving her (my mom) money for her rent, while still trying to get my own place. I just got a new car after my last one got totaled after a woman rear ended me into oncoming traffic ending in a three way collision all because she decided to text and drive..so no I don't have spare cash to go to a therapist. I sleep on the floor of my moms storage room so there's a lot of shit in here and barely any space plus the floors are hardwood so that's fun..I just wish someone, anyone would just come up and hug me and tell me it'll be ok..but bein a 6'2 black man I'm seen as a threat or sexual predator by most so highly unlikely..."

"i constantly feel so lonely, i haven‚Äôt had a friend to open up to in years (she was like a sister but we sadly parted ways) so now i just kinda keep everything to myself. i only have 2 solid friends and i can‚Äôt rlly open up to them because the 1st one literally refers to me as her ‚Äútherapist‚Äù plus i‚Äôve kinda tried before but i didn‚Äôt receive comfort. then my other friend, i open up a little to but it‚Äôs usually in disguise of a joking manner so i don‚Äôt make him too uncomfortable. 
and it‚Äôs also just that fear of burdening others w my problems.

it hurts when everyone talks to me like everything is normal and that i‚Äôm okay, when in reality it feels like i‚Äôm deteriorating. i know it‚Äôs not their  fault if i don‚Äôt say anything, but i can‚Äôt regardless. so i just have to press on and pretend like things are fine. 

during times like this, i just need a hug, or comfort in general and the only way i get that is through disassociating, binge watching media, and junk food.

 
journaling helps sometimes but it‚Äôs hard to stay consistent and not the same as having that moral support & knowing someone is there for you.

i‚Äôm now i‚Äôm in the weird position where i want to talk to my therapist but since she‚Äôs new and i‚Äôve only had one session w her then idk how much it would help because she doesn‚Äôt rlly know my background, what things are significant to me, who is important to me, etc.

"For many black people especially in America there is a fair amount of social conservatism(religion, elder respect,etc) but also just general things associated with being black. Deviating from these standards can make you a minority within a minority. 

 For me, I guess I am a quadruple minority(black, trying to decide between liberal Christian or non-Christian, CF, and autistic).My family was pretty dysfunctional growing up, with my parents fighting, accusing each other of cheating and then some. Aside from my Asperger's there is some type of mood disorder on my dad's side and he, my sister and a few of his relatives display anger outbursts and/or aggressive tendencies. What was awful stressful was the ''life is a play where I am the one without the script'' level of social skills I had due to being on the spectrum. While I wasn't necessarily bullied, it was clear I was different and definitely was seen as weird or odd at times.


Within some of the more ''hood'' circles there's the concept of being white if you like certain things, speak proper English, etc. I wasn't from such a background but if I was I would fit that(geeky, don't like using the N-word period). Honestly, while I haven't felt like an outsider for being black, I do feel like me being black makes me more subconscious about being an Aspie. Throughout my life people *constantly* asked me if I played basketball or suggested it. (When I was 13 and we were on a family trip to Universal Studios we stopped for snacks at a Safeway and a black employee practically followed us and held out a basketball to me while I guess talking about how good I would be. 



The question of whether or not I am into basketball is for me a loaded question since being a tall black guy adds an extra bit of insecurity to being autistic. People expect you to be into basketball and the like(still get questions to this day) and it's not just about the sport itself. People who are into sports or even athletes are typically the polar opposite of me(social adept, outgoing, confident,etc) and so it feels not just that I am different in general but the opposite of what I was supposed to be. Has anyone ever said that because I am a tall black guy I have to play basketball/can't be on the spectrum? No but when you look at folks in the NFL/NBA do you ever think they were like how I was in K-12? Plus my dad, the star player who peaked in high school forced me to play on my middle school team, with both ''it would make me happy'' and threats eventually.



Regarding K-12 years, lacking the formal social experiences people usually get there makes me feel less adequate as an adult in that I know how to socialize now but don't have the experience of accumulating it as a kid or teen. Not fucked up beyond repair, I wasn't even really bullied but did embarass myself. Thing is I acutally don't mind being a nerd or not fitting racial/gender stereotypes or being an introvert, but having a normal brain would have helped make the most of those things and cope with the family BS.


Bottom line my bei g autistic isn't something I am proud of or happy to have. I don't think people with any disorder should be looked down on or infantilized but romanticizing it is also an issue. I am not some quirky genius, I just struggled to reach a baseline most take for granted and would gladly trade to be neurotypical. But fate saw fit to make me autistic and the last kind of person you would expect it from..."	Zen-Paladin	post	16.85588091107442	male	White	0.9717929363250732	na	na	na	3	BlackMentalHealth

Recently I remembered the first time I physically felt anxiety was when my mom and one of my aunts were arguing real heavy. That feeling I had in my stomach is the same one I get now. I felt it again when that same aunt who I have not had contact with in over twenty years tried to drag me into something through a direct message."

"As someone who works with and for families of children and adults on the spectrum and with developmental disabilities, I must say, your ability to process and then express your experience speaks volumes to the growth and progress you have made to feel ‚Äònormal‚Äô.  And I wouldn‚Äôt have suspected any type of social deficiencies from your post if you didn‚Äôt mention it. 

And I‚Äôll tell you this, your experience is far from unique. (Dysfunctional family, expecting to like bball because you‚Äôre tall, etc.) Most times we feel like we have to fit into a particular stereotype in order to connect with other black people, subduing or hiding other parts of ourselves that may not be considered ‚Äòblack‚Äô. But that‚Äôs just societal bs. 

Be yourself, people with like you and connect to you. What becomes awkward is when you try to be what people expect you to be, knowing damn well that‚Äôs not you.  Learning social constructs, ‚Äòthe script‚Äô is a part of life and will help you to survive different social situations and should be kept separate from who you are as a person. 

I don‚Äôt think your atypical for a black guy. I think you‚Äôre a typical guy/person just going through the same growing pains most of us have to go through. 

Personally, I went to an all white school in elementary and lived in the ‚Äòhood‚Äô. I didn‚Äôt  connect with the kids in my neighborhood and would often feel ostracized. Had nothing to do with them, our lifestyles and up bringing just made it harder to connect. As I got older and went to school with more diverse populations I learned that stereotyping is really just that. You make the choice to give in or do your own thing. 

Sorry for the long post but I think the only thing here for you to accept is yourself and that there‚Äôs nothing a-typical about you bro."	Zen-Paladin	reply	na	na	na	0.9717929363250732	weak	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"there are a few ppl in my life (outside of family) that i would do absolutely anything for because i love them so much. i bend backwards for them even if it‚Äôs at my expense. i never expect anything tangible from them in return, i only want their love. up until abt 30 minutes ago, i didn‚Äôt think there was something wrong w that but something happened that made me question my subconscious intentions.

in hindsight, i do these things in hopes that the recipient would love me as much as i loved them because i figured they‚Äôd see the lengths i go to make them happy. ofc that‚Äôs never my entire intention because i love giving meaningful gifts or doing anything for them regardless. but i guess in a way it feels selfish because i expect them to love me more.

i‚Äôve just always had an issue w feeling like people don‚Äôt love me as much as i love them. and my problem is i cling and attach to ppl so when i love someone, i love them hard. i have this one friend, i love him beyond words. so much so that it brought me to tears when i was telling my old therapist how much i appreciate him. said all that to say, im getting him a gift for his birthday this month but this time i‚Äôm not expecting ‚Äúhis love back‚Äù i‚Äôm just doing it because i genuinely love him.
i think it‚Äôs different when i‚Äôm not unsure on if someone has mutual love for me. but i‚Äôm happy to say that even when i have my doubts, i know he loves me as well.

but then there‚Äôs another side of the spectrum. i‚Äôve been involved w someone for a year now. things were euphoric in the beginning then everything slowly started changing. i don‚Äôt feel as loved by him as he used to make me feel. i understand it could be bcuz he‚Äôs preoccupied w his personal life shit but it‚Äôs rlly been fucking w my mental. we‚Äôre still in contact we just don‚Äôt talk as much as we used to. but i let him know that i‚Äôll always be there for him and i‚Äôm willing to do anything for him. back in january, i wrote 2 college essays for him just to take the stress off his back so i can endure it instead. but that was when he still showed me love & affection, so i did it because i loved him not because i wanted his love. (i think ?) 

a few hours ago he reached out to me abt something he needed and i couldn‚Äôt help but feel of use bcuz he finally needed me and this is my chance to make him ‚Äúrestore his love for me‚Äù which i know sounds kinda fucked up but i‚Äôm also doing it because i love him and i know his personal situation so if i have the means to help then i‚Äôm going to do it regardless of our ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù status, so does that make it an altruistic gesture??


in conclusion, my self worth and contentment is dependent on being a pawn for others in exchange for their love lol

"If you haven't already look up attachment theory and attachment styles. From what I read you sound a lot like me. My counselor helped me out a lot with that. 

I have an anxious attachment style. I'm working on becoming more secure but it's tough. I've been very codependent in a lot of previous relationships/situationships and even friendships. 

I've always felt like whoever I love will never love me the same. I feared that If I stopped doing whatever I started doing  with them, they would leave. Huge fear of abandonment. I always looked for validation from everyone outside myself. So on and so forth.  

Once I realized what I was doing and why, I DID feel a lot of guilt because I felt I was selfish. ...I thought what I was doing was having a big heart. I was actually trying to control situations in order to tame my fear and anxiety. It's never a good feeling, and the other party almost always feels smothered, pressured or controlled by me.

Some books that helped me out were Attachment Theory for Beginners by Damian Blair and Attached (counselor recommendation) by amir levine. Take a look. It might give you some insight and help.

"i often feel very strongly about the concept of selfish.
i've been called selfish in the past for taking care of  basic needs like defending myself.
am i to trust that we really know what the word means anymore?

how many people will say you are selfish for doing self-care when they aren't?

never forget that it is possible to doublethink. doublespeak. in your own head. 
the warning sign is when you feel like you opened two hundred doors two hundred questions.
Maybe the last question is better left unanswered.
preservation of mystery is your inheritance.

maybe also look up the term ""transactional relationships""
i'm still working on understanding it. i think i see that any and all relationship has some element of give and take, there's some transaction of effort and attentive care. however it must never drop to the point that we see numbers instead of sentiment.

i'm with jazzmo on the guilt and learning to accept my needs. I only needed to be falsely accused of selfishness once for it to be more than necessary. it's not all love and lights there are manipulitive predatory people who wait for you to be vulnerable and then leap. guilt is hard to deal with. they want us to feel so guilty so we buy their products and act unassuming. growing up in a religious household for instance i felt very maligned at times for simply speaking up. it's not right to mistreat someone for speaking up. it still happened. i still need to cherish the part of me that should have gotten cherished then."	wermpiss	reply	na	na	na	0.008029639720916748	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"I have a similar situation where I began trying to earn people's love due to self esteem issues. I think that it comes from feeling like I had to earn my father's love, time, and attention. When I dated someone who was an avoidant, like my dad, I began chasing them too which was stressful and embarrassing as hell.

I'm currently working in therapy to become more secure. 

I think you'd only be selfish if you got angry or upset with people who didn't reciprocate to your level. Building up self esteem can really help.

"After years of therapy, I've learned that it's okay to tell your therapist what helps and doesn't help you. Better if you can try to get at ""why"". There has always been a few weeks' getting to know you period for me no matter how amazing the therapist. They are professionals but everyone is different and they will need (and should *want*) to know the best ways that you receive support to be effective and save time. I straight up had to tell one of my older therapists that just talking about an issue doesn't feel helpful to me since I already think about them alllll day. I usually need to know what can I *do* about a thing.  It irritates me so much when other therapists were just like ""let it go"" or ""accept it"" or ""move on"" and that's it because that felt like surface level advice. I need to know ""what do I do in my body and/or mind to stop the spiraling thoughts"" because most of the time, I think we want to do the right thing for us but don't know *how*. So I got really granular and it opened up a lot more helpful stuff for me. And the therapist had that information all along - we just had to both work to get at it.

"I moved to a different part of the US for a post-grad job and subsequently left behind my entire extremely toxic family but also all of my friends. First time I realized how much having other black folk around me really mattered, even if we weren't close.

They just attributed it to me being rebellious or promiscuous. aka ‚Äúgrown‚Äù or having an ‚Äúattitude‚Äù when I was just quite literally fighting for my life cause I was being abused.		follow-up	na	na	na	0.014362389221787453	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"I agree that anger is often used to mask other emotions. It's one of the "" negative"" emotions that people feel most comfortable with experiencing. It could be an expression of depression, PTSD,  or other feelings. I think that anger is also culturally accepted as well. 

There's a sense of power when angry, and it's easier to experience. Sorrow and depression can often make people feel vulnerable, hopeless and like they have a lack of control over their lives. It makes sense."		reply	na	na	na	0.014362389221787453	no	no	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
"Honestly. I don't know about that. As in i don't really agree or disagree. I think when it comes to us. Depression just isn't something we pay attention to/validate as something real. And then that we don't define as having consequences/reactions that effect other things. I mean we ignore it most times from the way i see it. But. It just flat out doesn't exist for us.

&#x200B;

Don't get me wrong. It without doubt exists. And there are consequences/reactions to it. It's just that the very idea of depression has long since been labeled as a white people thing. Something only white people have the luxury of. And to a degree. They are correct. I also don't think it looks different on us. Or that we react differently to it. It's just that black well being is a void. For lack of better words...a blackhole. That when addressed by anyone the vast majority suck it into other areas. Never to really be seen again in it's original helpful form.

&#x200B;

We express lost just well. I think it's that since we still have a lot of influence in us from certain kinds of white people (toxic masculinity, church/religion, gender norms, sexuality norms, etc) that it isn't that we're afraid to express our depression. Or afraid to admit we're depressed. As many of us having no idea we are in fact..depressed. Overwork and anger. As far as i can tell. Aren't depression. They can be and often times are created by/a transition from depression. But they are not depression itself.

&#x200B;

That i think is part of the problem when it comes to us expressing and understanding depression. That with refusing to deal with it and/or label it what it is. The first instinct is to transition it into something else. With the desire to transition it into something both being valid and not. Depending on the circumstances. Have a racist white boss and need to hold it down until you can find something better? That's a moment in which transitioning the depression into something is valid based on survival. Putting loads of hours on the board for the sake of ego and the ability to use work ethic as a means to bash others? Not valid. Pissed off because said boss is a racist and you're trapped? Valid. Happy because you can talk shit about other people seemingly not working as hard as you even though they are still working hard? Not valid.

&#x200B;

In my mind we see what depression transitions into. Just not the depression itself. Making it invisible. And again. We aren't the only ones doing it. In fact, i think the vast majority of why we do it is because white people do. Cause we're talking hundreds of years of behavioral modification in america. I'm thinking before any positive comes out of working on anything. It needs to not be invisible first."		follow-up	na	na	na	0.014362389221787453	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

I've probably mentioned this maybe once or twice in a comment in different subreddits, but I'd like to share something with you all that has helped me a lot in regards to self-improvement and self-actualization. It's a personality type of thing called [The Enneagram](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-descriptions). It features 9 key personalities (types 1-9) and it goes VERY in depth to describe each one. It is a very useful aid in the self-growth process and I would love to see more black people look into it. If you are interested in looking into it, I would love to help anyone start looking into it that's interested!	squitwerttennisballs	post	26.683943373330585	male	White	0.0013855246361345053	na	na	na	1	BlackMentalHealth

When I hear a little intrusive voice
""You outshine us.""

I wish Black Women would remember that it's wasn't criminal to be fast. What is true is that it's criminal to be too fast.

I wish Black Women would notice their own pattern of quieting down on the first notice that they're being heard

Keep pushing until their full and swell

If I look at what racial stigma hold me down personally as a Black woman moving thru society I notice that I tend to want to go quiet and feel like I am too much. My darkness sticks out in your whitecentric capitals. In general Imm seen as an oddity or abherrance. My existence is large

I‚Äôm tired of her pushing me with questions on what I‚Äôm doing with my life when I can‚Äôt even get my mind to think properly.

"Hey, I hope you're doing a little bit better. And I'm now just getting a chance to read this.

There's a question I do want to ask though?

Have you got down and talk with your family about your mental health and issues that you might be struggling with?

I can understand sometimes that families and friends might not understand what you're psychologically going through in the mind.  Sometimes it might help to sit them down and tell them exactly what you're going through.  Like vent about it a little bit.

But also understand that their opinions are their opinions based on your actions and what you do.

I went through a similar situation with my family when it comes to talking about mental health and depression. It results into many complications and family thinking that I'm just lazy and I'm not finding opportunities to live for myself.
 
Also it came to thinking that I was making excuses for my depression not being able to persevere through the daily challenges of life.

But if none of that works, my best bet would be to stay in therapy and keep working with them.

"From my experience. It's not about you. If your family is anything like mine. There are massive amounts of egotism/narcissism present in the decisions they make. In my family part of the reason they would and still do ignore people's existence is because of how it might look to people outside the family. Along with this idea that admitting problems is somehow a weakness. I used to have family members say all kinds of shit about me. Manipulating me and situations for specific reasons. And at the time i had no idea why. Turns out. It's because all they have thought about, do still think about and will forever think about is themselves. Or rather the idea of themselves they put forward. Any and everything else is just a black hole. A void of nothing.

&#x200B;

Figured out at the time that i shouldn't take what they say personally because even when they're talking about me. It isn't about me. It was, still is and will always be about control. Their control. Or rather. The appearance of control they have about themselves. With the added bonus of them without ever really knowing who i was attempting to make me into them. That's a kind of national past time for egotistical people/narcissists. They seemingly love (i use that word but it's not the kind of love in which good things come out of it) themselves so much. They want more versions of them.

&#x200B;

If i could give a word of advice. It would be to learn a bit more about them. Not who they claim to be. But who they really are. I've noticed that the more i did that (and it helped me understand other people better) the more they left me alone. Don't do it out of spite. Don't do it out of anger. Really truly try to understand them better. Cause odds are really good. If your family is anything like mine. You'll accidentally understand yourself better.

i want to drop out of this program so bad but i'm $12k down into it and i actually like what i'm studying i just hate the white-washed curriculum and environment. i came from a hbcu and attending all predominately black schools and the culture shock is a motherfucker. i don't find their jokes funny, talking to them is awkward and i feel like i'm 1/3 black students in the program (at least i think). i don't want to say too much that may identify me but it's a music program with literally no black music or black people or professors embedded into the program. they struggle to find me a internship each semester & literally ask me to find myself one multiple times even though it's their job to find me one. they have asked me to sacrifice days of my 9-5 job so now I work every saturday so i can do internship on thursday. & even after sacrificing one of my days, the placement they found me still won't give me all the hours i need to get out of the program. they found me a placement with 3 hours instead of 8 despite the fact that they know i took off a whole day to do these practicums and i need about 100 more hours to pass. they also asked me to sacrifice an additional day because they didn't find me a good placement that will get me all my hours. which i can't do because i literally work monday-saturday. sacrificing my sundays.. my only free day is a terrible work life balance. then to top it off, when we started the semester & i couldn't even start my practicum bc they didn't inform me about the onboard process so that's 4 weeks of hours missed. & i'm getting surgery & the extensions on my work have been vague to say the least. then they have no black music in the curriculum! there is a list of about 400-500 songs to pass the program i can count on one hand how many black songs are on that list. this makes it so much more difficult to learn those songs while some my white classmates have already passed and onto their official internships bc they grew up on these damn songs. this shit is just not fair. if there were more black songs i would've passed with flying colors but i do not relate to these white songs, i do not like these white songs nor do i see myself using them in my profession. i'm just so tired and fed up from dealing with this pwi & i guess i needed to vent shit. might get deleted cus i do want to graduate but damn i swear to god sometimes i just don't see the end to this program. i want to drop out because i'm just so damn unhappy with all the stress this program brings but i'm four semesters deep, i've worked too hard singing those damn folk and country and rock songs to stop now. i'm worked too damn hard to quit now i'm doing this for all the black kids like me who could benefit from what im studying by seeing more black faces in the field. i'm doing this for the kid in me who always wanted to use music to help people. i'm doing this for me but god my mental health feels like its tanking at this school. my hbcu gave me literally x3839261 more support than this pwi ever could. they even suggested i move out of my mama's house to find a free internship like who the hell is paying my bills!?!?!?!	-koka	post	20.12195699979429	female	White	0.9994968175888062	na	na	na	4	BlackMentalHealth

Most movies are about someone suffering, not just black movies. That‚Äôs how movies are. They are called tragedies in the literary term. Another synonym for tragedy is drama. And those are literary terms to describe stories that give us insight into the human experience, one of which is to experience suffering.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong these stories need to be told but aspirational films are helpful too. 

Almost all the stories about Black people that are awarded have something to do with dealing with racism. 

As someone said early most Black films are either comedies or dramas. This limits the kind of stories that will be told. There are very few quality made Black films outside these two genres.

"How do I stop comparing my financial circumstance to others‚Äînamely those who‚Äôve never gone into business for themselves, took the safe route working/going to school the whole time?

My self-reflection tells me my Ego is hurt because most of these people (and similar) I‚Äôm comparing myself to have admitted to having ‚Äúquit a long time ago‚Äù if they were me, ‚Äúnot willing to make the sacrifices I  have made,‚Äù etc. 

Sounds good; but I don‚Äôt care for a boost in pride. This is a heavy fall from grace‚Äîbasically resetting my entire financial journey. I felt behind before (I was on track/ahead for retirement/full financial independence) to now being objectively behind with no 401k, no Roth, no home (sold to pay off investor and business debts). I personally know people younger than me who became millionaires these past few years. I had the opportunity; but made too many mistakes. I gotta live with that and try to capitalize again. 

I took a job in education (back to square 1) and plan to contribute all earnings to debts, Roth, and 401k to get back on track. Planning to buy a multifam property by next year. 

It was easy to run my own race before because I at least felt like I was making good pace. Now it‚Äôs hard to feel like I‚Äôm even IN the race still. I know I am, but progress is slow AF; I‚Äôm used to going fast. But maybe that was part of the problem. 

It‚Äôs lonely when you‚Äôre building, even lonelier during rebuilding. I have to win one day so all my sacrifices aren‚Äôt in vain. Otherwise, I may as well be one of them.

"Out of conclusions out of conclusions, I've considered life doesn't matter. I'm not saying this in a suicidal way or giving up type of way. I am saying this as accepting my reality for what it is.

There are things I can't change. There are things I can't control. And there will be nothing I can do about it. 

Some things are just best to let go and move on. No one in this world will ever wait on you to be great. That's your responsibility and with the little time you have and what you can make of it.

The only thing I can do is control myself In the next steps in my direction towards good or bad actions and life-changing choices..

So I've decided that if my life doesn't change within the next year or two. I will give up, restart and get lost. I'll even commit suicide if I have to. 

But before I do any of that, I will make amends and peace with the people that use to love me, that do love me, and care for me before I go. 

I will give them gifts and whatever time I have with them to make the most of it.


I'll say this to anyone here that's going through some emotional issues, baggage, crisis, suicidal ideation and mental health.

1. Live your life
2. Take care of yourself. 
3. Don't give up. 
4. Be around people who love you. 
5. Don't give up on your dreams just because someone said it's not realistic.
6. Be the best you can be. 
7. If you believe that something could work. Keep pursuing it.
8. If you have the resources, time, and money, invest in therapy. 
9. Believe in your heart. That's what makes the best art.
10. If you went through a breakup, except that whatever relationship you have that person will never be the same. 
11. Create as much as you can.
12. Learn to be present.
13. Choose your friends very wisely.
14. Learn to adapt and change.
15. Be respectful and kind.
16. Speak your mind. I know a lot of us in life have this problem because of scarcity and fear of what others think. Trust me, it's better to speak your mind then to hold it in.
17. If you're feeling like you're being mistreated and hurt mentally and physically. Move away.
18. Don't be so hard on yourself. Try to at least not beat yourself up to a pulp where it becomes self-deprecating and pity amongst the people you like and love. Most people like someone with assurance and confidence to improve and challenge themselves. 
19. If you ever feel stagnant, travel. Just get out there and go and different directions.
20. For anyone that's black: understand that you're amazing everyday whatever pitfalls you go through, whatever shitty circumstances happen do not define you.  

You are you, for you, and only you, so be you for you."	MISTAX1995	post	22.932587210479475	female	White	0.0015314283082261682	na	na	na	3	BlackMentalHealth

I keep telling myself that ill accompish ""this and that"" by ""this"" date, but it always passes. I always set myself back, and instead of living in the now, im anticipating the future. I've tried to put my goals in action, but then its like I hit a wall and im back to my old habits in no time. I don't want to be around people and people don't want to be around me, so im stuck in a place where im scared of putting myself out there in fear of rejection. The real world is terrifying and challenging, but that's what its supposed to be; however, I wish I could just hit a restart button.

">10: If you went through a breakup, except that whatever relationship you have that person will never be the same.

This one is spot on. And it's okay for it to never be the same as it was. 

2c: relationships only stay the same if the people in them stay the same, and people are always changing, with or without breakups.

>16: Speak your mind. I know a lot of us in life have this problem because of scarcity and fear of what others think.

This one is so hard, especially as it intersects with privilege. But it being hard doesn't make you any less right about it being important.

The types of advice you've listed, as well as the precise ordering of the advice, strikes me as extremely thoughtful and on-point.

"The hard lessons and most helpful things that I have learned are:
1) usually I will go through long periods of hardships and anguish. Right when I'm about to reach my breaking point, a major breakthrough in my life happens and positive things start happening.
2) sometimes I have to go through pain to learn an important life lesson that helps me out later in life. I'm paraphrasing, but DMX said something like  there's a gift in a struggle if you can push through the pain. True.
3) sometimes when I  feel something bad has happened to me or I didn't reach a goal, I later found out that the bad thing actually protected me from something far worse that would have happened
4) Learn to change my perspective about things. Rejection can mean protection from something. Alternatively, some thing that I think is good may not be good for me. Look up the Taoist parable who knows what's good or bad.
5) Never ever give up hope.
6) Get help. Free mental healthcare for everyone: I highly recommend the Therapy in a Nutshell YouTube channel. Great cognitive behavioral therapy channel. If you are willing to do the work, it will help you change your perspective and decrease self-inflicted pain.
7) Eliminate toxic people from your life. For me, this included family that caused trauma and don't allow me to heal from it."	MISTAX1995	reply	na	na	na	0.0015314283082261682	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

" I have my own issues: from housing to mental health. I‚Äôm also in California, and am really worried about the environment (but, obviously imperfect).

"Every time I connect with men, they want to have sex. It's part of their basic anatomy to release what's inside their body and orgasm from it. Makes it easier for them to use sex to try to solve and cure everything, and to sleep with people they don't even want or like just to get off (and I've been used for this purpose. Not utterly oppose to it but it did less for me than them). 

I've had plenty of sex and still feel isolated and deprived of basic touch. 


More than PIV I need a forehead kiss.

A firm hug.

A finger that gently grazes my arm. 

A warm smile returned. 

Fingers that catch in my hair and massages my scalp momentarily. 

Holding hands. 

Thighs touching while sitting on a bench and talking. 

This is greatest intimacy I crave and nearly never had.

Story of everyone's life, right ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòí


I have a male friend. He is wonderful. He has a girlfriend he loves and is sexually faithful and monogamous to and I like that because there's no pressure to have sex or be intimate. Purely platonic. He likes hugs and gives them to his close friends and family, male and female (I've seen this). I'm honored to be considered among his closer friends. I got a few hugs from him and they were delightful, but I no longer hug him. When I hug him I close my eyes and I feel a little too comfortable. A little too relaxed. A little too safe. I hug a couple of seconds longer than I'm comfortable with just to soak in more warmth and comfort from his body. Then I let go, smile, say 'thank you' and leave. He's a very gracious host and a good listener. Intelligent, articulate, refined, acutely self aware and committed to self improvement. 

I get in my car and I feel happy and fulfilled, with a residual tingling sensation akin to electrostatic impulses. Then I feel scared, bewildered, and longing. Because I want more. I didn't want to let go. One hug was too many and several more within that day, week, or month would not be enough. I worried if I was an energy draining vampire and could he feel that. I drove away so I would cry not in front of his house.  

I never want to 'wear out my welcome' anywhere so there's months between seeing him again even tho he says I'm welcome more often. 

He came into my life after I'd sworn off ever trying to have friends, male or female. I've always been a loner, an outcast, a reject who doesn't belong anywhere and never has more than one, possibly two friends at a times for a short time. One female friend from childhood I gradually lost contact with. Another used and hurt me. Sex always ruined any friendship I try to have with men. So I socially regressed and went back into my shell, my misanthropy and social anxiety growing stronger. I became adverse to touch, stopping and stiffening at the lightest brush of a stranger and inwardly seething at the violation of personal space and distance. 

I'm still very much like this and was like this when I trusted him enough to allow him into my space. He came by showering me with praises about my writing and intelligence. I was leery. No Black man ever likes my musings that I put into writing. They say I'm hateful, crazy, a misandrist (misandrynoir?) and need psychlogical help. I'm bored and no longer flattered by compliments on my physical. We struck up a conversation about what I wrote and we were mutually intrigued. 

I don't care if I never get another friend in my life because this has been fulfilling despite my anxiety, distrust, and reservations. Its exactly what I wanted, but fear and anxiety lurk in the background like rabid vultures. 'Knowing' it will end. Afraid it will end. Wondering when it will end and how. Not wanting to think about and deal with my feelings if and when it ends. 

I don't want him to be my romantic companion but I wish I had a romantic companion exactly like him. Then I think I would ruin that and I appreciate things exactly as they are. I do miss those hugs."

You have a way with words, I could tell that even before I got to the part about black men not liking your musings. And them thinking you‚Äôre crazy because of it.

Bro, most people don't want to be around when someone is not doing well. They only want to be around when you're super positive and happy (even fake happy).

"I made a post a while back saying that men need to stop saying ""they just need a good woman"" to help them make it through life. All they do is make a woman an emotional dumping ground for their problems and make her worse while they don't get better.

Women do the work on their own because they realize men aren't gonna help them heal, they are gonna add to their trauma and distrust. Men feel entitled to have somebody help them or do it for them.

"Black Masculinity is constantly discussed, usually by people who don't even consider themselves men and males. Sometimes, there are comparisons to non-Black masculinity and in other spaces, viewed as the same as other groups. There's hardly ever a critical look at it from a truly Black/Afrikan perspective. And what's worse is there is encouragement from these people who don't consider themselves men and males to individually define Black Masculinity. 

Through anthropology and biology, it is universally accepted that Afrikan people were the first group of humanoids to walk this planet. Which means WE are the parents of civilization, Black Man being the father and Black Woman being the mother. 

With that said, we need Real Black Men to come together and reestablish a universal comprehension of Black Masculinity.

"A Black feminist reading two Black men discuss 'Black masculinity' and disagreeing on what it is, while remembering that in another thread by a Black man (a short ways over), he said Black women with the complaint that ""black men don't protect Black women"" have to consider whether or not they are *worthy* of protection.  

I don't think this subject is worthy of discussion but *obviously* Black men need to discuss it so they can figure out what the hell it is. You won't come to a consensus, I can guarantee you that. 'Black masculinity' often rest on the backs of patriarchy, male dominance, and female submission and subjugation. Its hypersexual and heteronormative. Violence and fear of violence has to be included and normalized in order for 'protection' to be talked about and valued as much as it is. Now for the Black men in which all the aforementioned is TRUE, they will deny it. 

For the Black men that want to acknowledge that the aforementioned is TRUE and want to change it, you'll be thwarted by the Black men in denial. 

I can read that in the short exchange by the OP and the first initial commenter.  

And where do gay, bisexual, and transvestite (not transsexual) MEN fit into this equation of black masculinity? Or they don't have 'masculinity' because they too much like women with too much 'feminine' energy.

"Why does it seem like white people can get any drug on the planet from their psychiatrist (or anyone else) but they keep wanting to limit Black folks. 

I have major depression and anxiety (among other things but that's what I took meds for). My anxiety is getting worse because I'm socially regressing and repressing my feelings and words. I've been hurt one too many times so I'm avoiding people as much as possible. I bite my cheek to keep from having conversations and discussions with people trying to talk to me... because that shit got me alienated and fired before. I can't stand to witness arguments or disagreements among others or with me involved. I have to leave, breath deeply and drink water because it feels like I'm on the edge of a panic attack. 

I have gotten Xanex and Valium before. Percs and Vics were really calming but I know I can't get that for anxiety. Anyways, I changed psychiatrist because I moved and she 'doesn't prescribe controlled substances.' That's the shit that works! Tried moving to another psychiatrist and they said 'if you're moving to try to get the drugs your other psychiatrist won't give you, we probably wont give them to you either.' 

So I'm gonna have to take a trip to the psycho ward just to get something strong enough that works. But my stints in the psycho ward was always involuntary.

Any therapist can post their opinions there and their SEO is popping so when you search psychology questions in Google or Duck Duck Go, you‚Äôre likely to get a Psychology Today article.

Take what you read from there with a grain of salt. If you read the articles, click on the links. Read the results. Check the data the claims are based on are statistically significant.  Check the methodology to see whether they have representative sampling. Look at the sample size. Also keep in mind that correlation is not causation. There could be confounding factors. It‚Äôs a good idea to do this for studies you hear about on Good Morning America or Facebook. Wherever!

The article titled ‚ÄúThe Rise of Single, Lonely Men‚Äù that said more men should go to therapy cited ONE journal article that said men are more likely to be lonely than women. The same article said people in individualistic societies (like the United States) are more likely to be lonely than those living in collective societies (everywhere else). And younger people are more likely to be lonely than older people.

The other data was on dating apps which said 62% of dating app users are men.

All the research cited in that article said nothing about therapy.


I‚Äôm not saying you shouldn‚Äôt go to therapy! I would just say go for you. Don‚Äôt let someone shame you into going so you can be more dateable for them. Go because you need someone to talk to. Because you lost your dog. Whatever!

If you‚Äôre reading anything that makes an assertion make sure what you are reading is from reputable sources and if not find that info if you want to know.

"It‚Äôs my last semester in college and I‚Äôve kinda had trouble making new friends throughout (especially due to the COVID shutdown). I like talking to people who I‚Äôm close to or who are in my classes or labs, but I feel like I can‚Äôt break past being acquaintances with them. 

I deal with social anxiety, so I always feel like I‚Äôm ‚Äúon edge‚Äù because I‚Äôm afraid of doing something humiliating and awkward. I spend so much time analyzing EVERYTHING (How am I walking? Am I staring too much? How does my face look? That person probably doesn‚Äôt like me, etc.) and it became a self-fulfilling prophecy üôÉ 

My close friends and family who know me knows that I like to talk a lot and I‚Äôm a little eccentric. But, I feel like I can‚Äôt be that way around other people or even when I‚Äôm alone because I feel like I‚Äôd be too weird or something. 

At this point, I‚Äôm tired of being scared and I want to be more comfortable with myself enough to not be stuck in my anxiety. 

However, I don‚Äôt know where to start."	PrettyInPink710	post	6.220219371760635	female	White	0.9957564473152161	na	na	na	3	BlackMentalHealth
"Have you gone to therapy? A professional can give you tips to manage your anxiety. 

I am often the same way, but at some point I realized I‚Äôm not a kid anymore. If I am weird or awkward it doesn‚Äôt matter, my life doesn‚Äôt revolve around seeing the same people in class or what not anymore. 

I so wish I had come to that conclusion in college because that was the best place to make connections and I let my social awkwardness hold me back. I had friends, but I held myself back a ton. There were also weird awkward things that I did that I still think about. üò© I‚Äôm still alive to remember them. I didn‚Äôt die of embarrassment. 

Now I tell myself I deserve to express myself even if it doesn‚Äôt come out right. I don‚Äôt have to look perfect. People don‚Äôt have to like me. I have to like me. I‚Äôm still ABG, but I‚Äôm good with that. If I‚Äôm weird or overthinking etc, that fine I expect and plan for that in myself. You are fine like you are anxious, awkward, over thinker.

"Learning how to listen well really helped me be less awkward. I deal with bipolar and ADHD as part of my portfolio, so I tend to just blast people with oversharing. When I took the time to stop and take in what people were saying, and focus on digesting the information to learn more about them, and ask questions that keep the conversation going, it made people really like me more. EVERYBODY likes a good listener. 

And it gives you time to observe, too. How do other people interact? What effect does it have when they do the things they do? What about that might feel natural to you, if you did it? How might something you see fit your vibe? Finding your own patterns might require the help of a therapist, who can help you untangle some of the anxiety from around your body's own comfort zone of reactions and presentation.

Realistically, EVERYONE does humiliating and awkward things sometimes. There is not a soul alive who hasn't done something cringe. Some people do it all the damn time, but they just blame others for it, and call it ""confidence,"" or ""being an alpha,"" or some other stupid bullshit like that.

"(Warning very long) I‚Äôve been digging into my psyche recently and realized that my personality as a kid was a response to surviving my fathers rage/anger. I always walked on egg shells, always agreed and suppressed my true feelings. I‚Äôd never step out of line in fear I‚Äôd get hurt or screamed at. This persona stuck with me for years, which attracted some racism and ignorant white folks. They saw me as the ‚Äúsafe black dude‚Äù cause of my attitude and the way I spoke at the time. I grew up in a diverse neighborhood but never had a strong black role model since we were the few black families in the area. My father was the only male figure I had, but I never felt safe around him and carried that attitude toward other  black men. That‚Äôs when the internalized racism started to kick in, I listened to different music but never rap music cus I believed my tastes at the time
(Jazz/50s music) was more ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù or ‚Äú beyond hip hop‚Äù
It was like I was purposely avoiding my culture cause thru blackness I saw my father, and wanted away from that. Thankfully these thoughts starting to change in high school, which was mainly black/brown. I slowly started to adapt and discover my blackness. I had more black friends, started to appreciate Rap/R&B. My whole attitude started to change, the way I spoke and carried myself. The things I was into changed and I started to feel like‚Ä¶.myself. But there are days where I  feel like my blackness is invalid, that past experiences tolerating ignorant white folks made me less black. That I‚Äôm always that kid who doesn‚Äôt want to identify with his culture. I changed over the years but I feel like a fraud. But at the same time me back then wasn‚Äôt ME if that makes sense.

"Here are some quotes that may be helpful to say to yourself in times you feel conflicted.

Fluidity means that our black identities are constantly changing as we respond to circumstances in our families and communities of origin, and as we interact with a wider world. - Bell Hooks

I'm learning to ""master self"" while rising from the ashes of madness.
Stanley Tookie Williams

Whatever is bringing you down, get rid of it. Because you‚Äôll find that when you‚Äôre free . . . your true self comes out. ‚Äì Tina Turner (you have now passed the obstacle between you and your black identity, now you can explore your true self)

Perhaps all anxiety might derive from a fixation on moments - an inability to accept life as ongoing. - Sarah Manguso

There is nothing like returning to a place that remains unchanged to find the ways in which you yourself have altered. - Nelson Mandela

"I'm so sorry you had that experience growing up, surviving your dad's anger. That is a painful thing for a child to go through. I definitely hear in your post that you've done a lot of work healing because of how much awareness you have of what was happening at the time and how you're able to put it into words so well. I think you hit the nail on the head when you described the internalized racism, and the way your experiences as a child made you dim your voice and make yourself smaller, and how whiteness benefitted from and capitalized on all of that. You have a very powerful story!

To speak on feelings of confusion and identity, I just want to say a few things that I hope will help:

When you are in an environment where whiteness and white/western ideology and value is upheld as the norm and standard, a story is being told about what is good, what is important, what is valuable, what is normal (and conversely what is not good, not valuable, not normal). A story is also being told about you. The thing is, it is easy to start to buy into the story and become changed by it. We must ask ourselves who the narrative belongs to; who is the author? Who does the story benefit? Much of what you described comes from the story of white supremacy and anti-blackness. Likely some stories around patriarchy and masculinity as well. 

The good news is that you have the power to define your identity with authority and the final say. Others will try to take the pen and tell you who you are through their words and their actions, but the pen is yours. You are the author and the artist of your life. 

Even better news is you've already taken steps in that direction. You've asked yourself what parts of the old story of white supremacy you have bought into; What parts of that story have you adopted and retold to yourself and conformed into, perhaps without even knowing it at the time. 

Now that you're aware of that, you can make a conscious choice to reject the premise of the old story and set a new standard.

"Separating my livelihood from my sense of self, and getting into a career path and a job that I quite like, but is not my PASSION, has been so good for me. Tying the activities that I loved to my ability to keep a roof over my head and food on the table really killed my love for them. And trying to force myself to love every aspect of the things I did, day in and day out, just to get money in my pocket, depressed the fuck outta me. Trying to *find* something I would love with my whole heart, *and* could do for 8+ hours a day, every day, and still love with my whole heart, stressed me the fuck out. 

But like...yeah. Now that I'm much more financially stable, and have been able to get through a health crisis with my finances intact, due to having a good-paying job with good benefits and a good support network, I'm a lot less fucking stressed. Financial stability and a good work environment have done wonders for my mental health. Getting some clarity on some identity issues that have been plaguing me also really gave me a boost.

"This is so true!! The work I did previously contributed greatly to further increasing my anxiety, depression, PTSD, and OCD. I felt so out of control and unhappy doing something that I worked hard for. I really enjoyed working with the people I served, but everything else (especially toxic work environment and the American health care/social service system is a SCAM) was killing me inside. Also, the pay was crap. I had to fight for PTO, and sometimes I just took it unpaid (my husband dealt with SI, and I couldn‚Äôt get any accommodations when he tried to do something one day. I said F this and just left. Job or my husband‚Äôs life??) 

I went from making mid $40k range to now making $65k minimum with bonuses throughout the year, unlimited PTO, supportive leadership, and the company truly does stick to their morals. It‚Äôs a fully virtual healthcare company, so it‚Äôs a remote job. Lastly, I do a lot less work. I‚Äôm able to focus on me throughout the day, and so when it comes to work/life balance, I lean more towards the life side of things. 

My mental health is a lot better. My depression and anxiety comes up less, I was finally able to focus on my health and get pregnant, and I am happier (minus pregnancy woes ü§£). I‚Äôm still in therapy, but to work through some past trauma and to build on self-esteem, which I am now better able to do. 

Money and job do play a HUGE factor in mental health. I love not having to struggle about money, worry about toxic work environment/bosses. I like having control over my time. 

I still work in healthcare which is awesome for me. But now I‚Äôm more so behind the scenes and working with a company that believes in creating a healthy work culture, which is better for me.

I don‚Äôt love him anymore, he did me so dirty but of course it makes me feel awful. 

On top of it I‚Äôm being sexually harassed by my supervisor at work. He keeps asking me out and flirting with me. I look his direction & every time he‚Äôs standing there staring at me.

"I'm 22weeks pregnant. I'm stressed. I've been on disability for a year due to a car accident and then they terminated my disability payments because I'm pregnant?  I'm struggling financially. My husband is taking on the burden. We are arguing more. I feel like I'm the problem. I'm depressed. I'm anxious. The disability company mentioned that I'm not at risk, because I haven't had any suicidal ideation, but I'm literally in an IOP (intensive Outpatient Program) for moms.

I WISH THE CAR ACCIDENT KILLED ME. so when I  talk about this. My husband says ""suicide is selfish""
 
He doesn't understand that I feel selfish for being alive. I feel selfish for not being able to work. I'm pregnant and can't move around like I usually would. I'm depressed and feel hopeless. I'm angry. I feel lost
 

People, especially in our community see suicide as a personal attack on the suicide victims inner circle.
But if I do kill myself my husband has one less mouth to feed. He's 31, he's a computer engineer. One of these chicks will want to be with him. He can rebuild his life. He's not a big emotional person anyways. He's gonna be fine without me. I feel like my baby would be better without me.

It just fans the flames of me wanting to make a quick exit and rip the bandaid off.  Nobody thinks black people kill themselves. My cousin killed herself when we were both 15. I'm not mad at her. She wanted pain to stop and so do I. I've resorted to cutting and burning my thigh but I hide it. When people day that self harm is stupid, I'm honestly envious but happy that they've never felt that it was a good option. Now when he sees it, that will just be a other burden on him. 

Even my dad doesn't get it. He brings up how hurt my cousins mom was, but like. Idk what to do. I bring nothing to my household. I'm used to being so independent. 

I literally want to go up to the disability office and blow my head off as a martyr, maybe then they'll realize black people get depressed."	U_PassButter	post	15.195745283349265	female	White	0.998001754283905	na	na	na	7	BlackMentalHealth

Telling someone suicidal that they're being selfish is awful, it just makes them feel worse.

"TL:DR What has helped me: therapy, meds, support system

I have never been pregnant, but am a 30s Black woman who has had clinical depression, PMDD, and suicidal ideation since age 13. I have a really good life - great family, friends, career, and a safe home. None of that prevents me from falling into these deep monthly depressions where all I can think about is how much I hate my job, I get angry at shit happening in the world, and I feel resentful that I was even born. Life feels like such a burden, like why the fuck am I doing all this when I could just end it and go to sleep forever? I want to express how I‚Äôm feeling, but no one else understands when I do, and it makes me feel like a Debbie downer. I never killed myself because I know it would absolutely break my mom, and I could never do that to her.

Depression is a disease. It is not something I will ever be cured of, but I have learned how to manage mine. I know these are things I will need to do forever, but now that I have figured out what works for me, I‚Äôm okay. I‚Äôm still stressed, but now it‚Äôs the normal kind of life stress everyone gets, so I can vent to my friends about it and they get it. You can‚Äôt give up yet. You haven‚Äôt tried all the treatments yet. You are bringing another life into this world and you owe it to them to do the work to manage your disease. Here are the steps I took to find the right treatment for my depression: 

1. Insurance. Mine isn‚Äôt the best - HMO with a high deductible, but my prescriptions are super cheap and I can talk to a psychiatrist on Teledoc for free. 

2. Meds. Your ob/gyn can prescribe you antidepressants, but if you can talk to a psychiatrist, I really recommend it. There are a lot of medications on the market. It can take a long time to find your perfect combo, but starting an antidepressant is what will start helping you the soonest. If you decide to share with anyone, you might get some opinions, but there are antidepressants that are safe to take during pregnancy. [Watch this for encouragement](https://youtu.be/OG6HZMMDEYA)

3. Therapy. You need to be able to talk about this stuff openly. I started therapy through BetterHelp. It‚Äôs like $250/month for one session a week and unlimited messaging. There‚Äôs some journaling and group session features I never used. But I liked that I could switch therapists no questions asked. I did therapy every week for two years. I got better at managing my triggers to prevent myself from spiraling into depression. I canceled BetterHelp and now schedule a $50 session directly with my therapist when I feel like I need one. Your insurance might cover this. 

4. Your girls. My husband and parents are amazing, but there is so much value in having strong friendships with other women your age. 

Things will never be perfect, but start by getting to a place where you feel okay. The road will be bumpy, but you can do this."	U_PassButter	reply	na	na	na	0.998001754283905	no	strong	strong	na	BlackMentalHealth

Hope this passes once the baby is born, been dealing with suicidal ideation since I was 23. Honestly, I gave up on trying to get my family to understand my depression and suicidal feeling. If you can see therapist that's the best thing to have someone to talk too other than that keeping a journal helps. No one can stop you from self harming but pooping a rubber band around your wrist might be alternative. I still have a thing with hot water but it's really fucked up my hands, skin's super dry and cracks easily. Insurance companies are evil. I hope you find alternative help and push through this, your feeling are valid, you're valid, your life matters, your life matters, it's your but I hope you stay. Be safe.

"I think that some people don't understand how it feels to view yourself as a burden and a drain on everyone around you. They don't know what it's like to feel so overwhelmed by stress and pain that, suicide seems like a suitable option. It's also just difficult to not take it personally when someone you love feels that way. Their immediate thought may be 'Am I not enough?' 'Am I failing to love this person enough?' 'How could they think to do something that would hurt me?' 'Are they not happy with me, do they not love me the way that I love them?'.

OP, the people that you love would not be better off without you. That belief likely stems from trauma and depression rather than reality. Believe them when they say they love you and want you around.

Right now you feel overwhelmed and like a burden on those around you, this has been triggered by financial and health related issues that are the result of the car accident. It is possible that the situation and the feelings associated with it will change. You can't see the future, so please don't make any permanent decisions.  Please try to seek help if you begin to have plans of harming yourself.

"I know this may be a little bit NSFW and graphic. But it's always been something I've been curious about as a person, a human being, and being black as a whole.

When I think about when people having sex, usually it's a very powerful form of intimacy and it shares connection. But also, I think about the people who really do it just for fun and casual hookups now and then to get the midnight oil off in your system. 

I always think about the people who do have multiple sexual encounters, and wonder if that's a healthy lifestyle or is that something that people just do to cope with reality.

Sometimes I want to ask my friends about their sexual encounters and experiences and how that affects them. But, I also have this feeling that sometimes maybe asking a lot of sexual things or even conversation might be too much for people to even explain on the other end. And I guess they would wanted to keep private and sacred or either under wraps not to shame or have people guilty of their own kinks and pleasures.

So I asked people here if sex should be used as a coping mechanism in general? Is it bad, is it just something to pass the time, or will that mentally f*** you up

"It's sounds like you're asking if casual sex is okay, and I don't really think that there's anything wrong with it. However, casual sex isn't for everybody, so it depends on the person. I personally think it is only good if both parties are being responsible and respectful towards each other. 

I don't think sex should be used as a coping mechanism though. Using sex as a way to avoid experiencing your emotions could possibly lead to someone using sex as a crutch whenever they are in distress.

"I think it is what you make of it.

I was raised in a strict Christian household, where sex was held up as this MYSTERIOUS, SACRED, AMAZING, SPECIAL, POWERFUL, DANGEROUS THING. Something literally magical, that would basically steal a piece of your soul, unless you did it within the bonds of marriage, where it would magically intertwine your soul with another and bind you together. 

Well, when I had sex for the first time, out of wedlock (gasp!), it was...just ""meh."" Like, it was so flat, cardboard, unimpressive, non-eventful. Just ""meh."" And that BLEW MY MIND!!! Like, yeah, I got off before we went ""all the way,"" and it didn't hurt, because we were careful and communicated and he listened. But no magic happened. No rainbows and unicorns. No lightning strikes. No hellmouth and demons. Just ""meh.""

And I was like, ""HOLY SHIT, I'VE BEEN LIED TO!!!""

I would come to find out, basically, that *sex is what you make of it.* There are lots of ways to experience sex. There are lots of philosophies and practices and cultural and psychological influences that come into it. What matters, I think, is examining and exploring and being honest about your own wants and needs, and figuring out if they're compatible with your potential partner or partners, *at that particular time.* Because it can change, too.

"I've had casual sex. 

It didn't start off that way. It was something I fell into when the friendship didn't work out and the guy was like 'well let's be FWBs or sex buddies.' 


FWB and 'sex buddies' didn't work out because if the guy wasn't good enough for true actual friendship then he bored me and I got disinterested. I stop seeing and sexing him. Sex and physicality doesn't attract me, strong emotional and intellectual bonds do. 

I get a superficial bond with a guy, sex him, then he bores me and I end it and off on the next guy. 

Self awareness and sex diagnosis: 
Sex addiction with asexuality and touch deprivation.  

I was touched deprived and thought fucking would cure it. It didn't.  

I was asexual (no sexual attraction to anyone) but I was fucking different guys for attention, affection and a deeper connection because all guys wanted sex and wasnt giving me what I wanted without it. But I didn't get what I wanted with sex either.  

I like casual sex, but whatever attracts me to a person for that happen is rarely there anymore and maybe it never was there.

"i‚Äôm an 18 year old black woman, navigating life in 2022. aka, me playing what feels like the impossible game.

i‚Äôve had my fair share of trauma. at just 12, i was sa‚Äôd by a friend of mine while attending middle school. this went on for a really, really long time, since it was on a schoolbus where he took advantage. at the time of my 6th grade year, it was still hard for me to understand sex, and i damn sure didn‚Äôt know what healthy sex was. i‚Äôm still traumatized, i still don‚Äôt understand. 

while navigating with PTSD, add in my depression and anxiety from dealing with my parents being jobless, my mothers absence because of illness, and me being the ‚Äú3rd parent‚Äù as an oldest child, caring for my 2 siblings. i strive to do so well in life, but society doesn‚Äôt attempt to understand anything i‚Äôve been going through. work and high school mixed terribly for me, like really bad.

i hate that i am so young, and so hurt. so, so hurt. life is so chaotic that it feels i can‚Äôt even put myself first. and being a woman on top of black just adds to my tension. i recently deleted all forms of social media (minus reddit LOL) and i feel so good, yet so lonely. i would talk to everyone, and now i‚Äôm here: alone. trying to understand purpose is so hard, i have been operating on autopilot; all movements, no thought. not alive, just living. breathing and moving with no joy left. i don‚Äôt know why the hell i keep going, but i just do.

Try to do something for yourself to manage your emotional like journaling, practice mindfulness(app) 
being amongst nature will help you to have some emotional intelligence. There are also resources on Reddit mental health, that you can access. 

Take each day as it comes and try to put your needs first. This is a journey that is very hard to go through alone. Ideally this it is better to do this within a therapeutic relationship in therapy.

"I‚Äôm 22 and I‚Äôm graduating this fall semester. I started my biology major on the pre-med in 2018. My grades and GPA were really good at that time, as I managed to get a 3.7. However, I was also dealing with a lot of mental health challenges which led to me getting diagnosed with Depression, Anxiety, and OCD. 

During the shutdown in 2020, some of those symptoms exacerbated and made it difficult for me to focus on my schoolwork. Throughout that fall and the following spring semester, I failed 2 classes and tanked my gpa to a 2.9. I was supposed to graduate this May, but failing Organic Chemistry 2 set me back a semester.

Fortunately, I began to take treatment seriously and my grades started to improve. During that time, I decided to not apply to medical school due to the stress that I‚Äôve experienced in the past for just thinking about it. My professor connected me with a National STEM mentorship program that focuses on research. I got accepted in the program and spent my summer doing research. I also registered for Organic Chemistry 2 so I could replace my failing grade. 

Both commitments took up so much time, I barely got to talk to or see my friends or even get time to myself. Organic Chemistry is already difficult in a regular 16 week semester, let alone a compressed 5 week semester. 

I was so proud of getting into this program because it would show that I‚Äôm capable of being accomplished like the rest of my family. However, being stretched thin has affected my Orgo grades. Surprisingly, I got good at solving the mechanisms and got B‚Äôs and C‚Äôs on the exams (really good for Organic Chem iykyk), but I would make so many silly mistakes on my lab reports because I was so sleep deprived, which killed my orgo lab grade. 

One of my siblings are in their third year of pharmacy school while another one is a rising college junior who‚Äôs majoring in biology, maintaining a 3.9 gpa, working as a tutor, and worked part time in a lab while taking calculus over the summer. They just finished the class with a 97. 

I love them and I‚Äôm proud of them, so I‚Äôm never bitter but instead, sad. They can handle heavy loads and still succeed. I‚Äôm barely getting by.

My parents also got upset with me when I told them about my class and said I wasn‚Äôt holding my end of the deal by being a good student and I was taking their financial support for granted. 

I broke down. My entire college career has been driven by pressure from my parents to make their investment in my education ‚Äúworth it.‚Äù

Right now, I feel mentally and physically drained. No matter how hard I work, it feels like none of what I do matters. 

I landed a position in a nationally renowned program, I managed to bring my GPA to a 3.1, and despite dealing with multiple mental  health emergencies, I made it 4 years later and only failed 2 classes out of the 40+ I‚Äôve taken. But it feels like my parents haven‚Äôt internalized that so none of what I just mentioned is valid.

And One more note: I want to add that I‚Äôm a 1st gen Nigerian-American for cultural context.

If I could give you some advice, though...don't set that as your baseline regular for how you want to operate going forward, necessarily. Get yourself some work/life balance.

Hey fam, I see you, I hear you, you are valid, I hope you find some peace. One piece of advice I would give, if you are open to it - if you are able, stop watching the news. Or reduce your news to only the things you absolutely have to know. It's one of the things I had to do to keep myself sane (bipolar 1, PTSD, a few other things), and it's made a huge difference. It's a source of mental poison right now.	Revolutionary_Gas410	reply	na	na	na	0.9814183115959167	weak	no	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
Firstly, this was so beautifully written. Your words I can tell you are an extremely intelligent, experiencing the dark side of this thing we call life. ‚ÄúThis the capitalistic decent to hell. I have to become a monster to claw out of it. It is not healthy. It is not sustainable; but it is necessary.‚Äù I felt this to the deepest level possible. I often times question my reality, morality because of tough spots I‚Äôve been in and start to see that based on the type of society we live in it is absolutely sometimes necessary to do what we have to in order to survive. Just a suggestion. Check out Urban car camping Reddit groups online. It will give you alot of tips that you may not have now. But it seems that if you can live from a car in a sustainable way, get a new job, or work under the table if you have to worry about money being stripped from your account etc. may be the way. Go to soup kitchens to get some free meals. If worst comes to worst. To keep yourself safe. Call 911 on yourself say what that you are going through mania and psychosis. Make up a story. Say you are a threat to yourself or someone else so they can admit you. So at least you can give yourself time to eat 3 meals a day and clear your mind. Watching the news, being around negative people, drugs alcohol etc is things you should stay away from so that you can clear your mind. Our minds are very fragile and if there is one thing you can do right now to get yourself out this is to protect your mind to keep your sanity. Keep writing you are a fantastic writer, keep venting, keep working out your thoughts if even in a personal notebook or on your phone to keep your sanity and be there for yourself. Love and hope. You matter, your life, your feelings and voice matters. üñ§	Revolutionary_Gas410	reply	na	na	na	0.9814183115959167	weak	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"1. I'm pretty sure that sharing your nudes against your will is an actual crime. Like, you could have him prosecuted for that, if you wanted to.  
2. Having a 2-parent household with a father who treats her mom like shit is going to be more damaging to your baby girl than being raised by one loving mom who shows her that it's okay to put herself first and liberate herself from a terrible situation with a toxic partner. Children look at their parents' relationships to learn what is ""normal"" and ""okay"" and ""good."" If you stay, your daughter is going to think that this is what she should look for in a partner. I say this as a person who grew up in a household with an unhealthy dynamic, who went through that exact problem. Break *that* cycle, nurture yourself, seek healing, and if you decide you want a partner long-term, seek out someone who treats you the way you want your daughter to be treated, at the very least, because *you deserve to be treated that way, too.*

He needs to go. You need someone who prioritizes you and the relationship just as much as you. He doesn't and most people will only change so much, even if he did become the person you wanted, it would take at least a decade more of dealing with shenanigans and straight up crimes against you like that and it still is not guaranteed he will get to that point or won't slip back into it if he does. You aren't asking for a lot, like at all, and he can't even do bare minimum to make you comfortable. It's not even like he is sitting around just ignoring you, he is putting in an effort to do things that he knows harms you. You are loving and devoted, you deserve someone who is the same way (and there are many others who are). It's time to let it go.

"This is one of those situations where I think you already know the answer deep down (or maybe not that deep down).

It sounds like this person doesn't respect the boundaries of your relationship or your personal boundaries (sharing your pictures without consent is gross behavior/criminal).

Listen to yourself, your intuition, your body's response (noting that you said you don't even feel comfortable hugging this person anymore)--listen to all of it. 

Once you've done your healing, you'll look back and be like ""wow, I gave that person 1 year too many.""

"I've found anger is part of the ways depression and anxiety show themselves especially when already overwhelmed. At my lowest, I bought a workbook on Amazon on anger management which are tailored for men and women that helped me massively. On getting yourself out of the initial depressive rut, do you have any routines you do on a daily basis, however small, that you can start to stick with and ensure you do. For me I feel better when I physically get out of bed, make it and brush my teeth. From there even if I chill on my sofa the rest of the day, I know I've achieved something that makes me feel less of a ""sinking"" and ""dread"". Hope that helps but know you are not alone in these experiences

"thats so great that you are taking steps to care for your mental health in a healthy way. in my experience, it can be challenging for people to engage in convos about mental health because many people really just lack the skills and knowledge or have their own unresolved mental health issues.

if you have access to therapy, that's probably going to be more helpful. also support groups (like this one) can be helpful too if you make an effort to share and ask for support.

if you're not interested in therapy then educating yourself about depression, anxiety, and anger issues would be a good place to start.

finding  healthy coping skills is going to be really important. this can take some trial and error figuring out what works best for you. id start with thinking about what things bring you joy as those can often become intentional ways to cope. also incorporating some practices of mindfulness (meditation for example) can be helpful with managing anger. you also need to be doing the work of addressing the deeper issues causing the depression, anxiety and anger.

when i first started my healing journey all of this seemed very impossible and overwhelming to do but with continuous effort and also with support its very possible to learn how to care for your mental health and it doesnt always have to feel like it does now"	BigGucciGuwopNLM	reply	na	na	na	0.9969857335090637	weak	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"I originally posted this in another community but I feel safer in this one lol.

I hate my boobs. They're not big, not small, kind of just below average. I'm demisexual so the oversexualisation in society really irks me, but lately I've been getting constant harassment. Over the past year I've have so many men ogle at me, catcall me, watch me in the park, or come up to me with racist or offensive intentions. 

Many years ago when I came to terms with my sexuality, I felt so good bc I realised my body is my own. I've always been boyish and told I look like a man, sound like a man and other disgusting things bc I loved embracing my masculine and feminine sides. I started catcalling men back, even if I looked crazy for yelling at them in the street, it made me feel good to see them in shock bc finally they realise they're not getting away with it. 

Now it's constant. They don't stop. It's so bad that I can't tell whether or not a man is looking at me as a creep or as just a regular passerby. Every time I think of leaving the house I get nauseous and heart palpitations. I feel sick just having boobs on my chest. Don't get me wrong, I've always loved my body from a young age but now that my adolescent weight has sit in its taken me a few years to adjust to it.

I hate that I know I look good, i know sometimes i just wear interesting outfits and maybe that's what people are looking at, but having literally any of my skin showing, or wearing anything that is slightly fitting is bad. I like the outfits and they're not for anyone else, but knowing I'll be sexualised even if I'm just wearing a box makes me sick. Just feeling my boobs on my chest makes me nauseous. I just want them off. I wish they were just a bit smaller like when I was a teen and they didn't move around and bring attention to themselves. I wish men hadn't taken power over my self image again.

To be fair, I've been going through a lot of other really traumatic stuff over the past 3 years, so this is just one of them and it's really eaten my natural self confidence.

"I've been pondering on this for a while. And I wonder if it would be a better option to use work as a coping method for emotional distress.

It might not be the healthiest of coping mechanisms. But it's a method to get in the right direction and not have to think about the overloading emotions someone has with depression, anxiety, or suicidal thoughts right?

I think to myself that it would be pretty bad because I won't have a social life and all I would be doing is talk about work. And then work becomes my absolute livelihood and not about me. Then another scenario would be I'm eliminating a human aspect of socialization out of my life and just making work a primary source of living and surviving.  

But I'm coping and I'm not worrying about all the emotions that I had to deal with in the past or none of the tendencies in my life. Basically, I will be distracting myself from things that could potentially hurt me while focusing on work.

To give you further context, I'm an artist working on becoming a better artist. Or what I would say have a career as an artist as a whole if that makes sense.

"(TW) I‚Äôve been struggling for years with depression and anxiety; somethings literally anything could trigger both but I‚Äôm able to manage for the most part. 

However, lately I‚Äôve been experiencing darker and darker thoughts. Most recently I started rationalising that it must be better to simply not exist than (for me) to bare the burden of life. Life has been kicking my ass and I‚Äôve been struggling to stay positive through it all. 

Not exist - I don‚Äôt have any desire to take my own life (at this moment) but I do feel at peace with the idea of not having to live life and all that entails. I‚Äôve concluded that life definitely is *not* worth living. 

To this end I‚Äôve been asking myself the question, ‚ÄúIs there a difference between having suicidal thoughts and just not wanting to exist?‚Äù I asked my councillor this question and they said what I may be experiencing is called, ‚ÄúSuicidal ideation‚Äù. But like I said, currently I don‚Äôt have any desire to take my own life. I am slightly worried that these thoughts can, at some point, becomes suicidal. 

With being said, I take solace in the fact that (for now) even though life isn‚Äôt worth living, I try anyway. I try to make the best of what I have and my situation(s) and I‚Äôm mildly hopeful that things would get better‚Ä¶eventually.

However, I don‚Äôt actively want to die either. Generally, I just let the thought pass and don‚Äôt think much of it. But there are also times where I think about it more seriously, but still in an ideation type of a way. I don‚Äôt have active plans for anything. When I was a teenager I was way more worried about it, but now it is just another thing that I deal with in life. 

As a therapist I don‚Äôt start safety planning with someone until they express having active plans to take their life. Like you mentioned, ideation can turn to intent, which is why I like to constantly check in with my clients and friends who have expressed any kind of ideation."

"I have been contemplating leaving behind my friends and family a lot lately. Instead of going the suicide route and ending my life, why not just stay away from my friends and disappear from their lives so I can grow, right?  

I don't know if I ever feel like a burden to them. I don't know if they want to cut me out of their lives. And some of the friends that I used to talk with and have excommunicated me don't want to interact with me either. 

And if suicide isn't the greatest ideal of all. Why not just leave and let them live their lives and I can just live mine and grow. 

Everyday and every year, it seems that people are changing and going on their own. Why not just do it in a way that isn't so hurtful and it would be beneficial to me if that makes sense?  

I just have that feeling that once I disappear. Things will be better for them and me. But mostly for them.

It also comes from this reoccurrence in my mindset that everyone has to be independent somehow. And you don't want to be coattail on someone else's life if you're not growing on your own right?  

Why not just leave and just live a new reality and instead of going back in the past thinking things will change from there.

">Why not just leave and just live a new reality and instead of going back in the past thinking things will change from there.

To be blunt, I believe trying to forget the past and pretending like it didn't happen isn't a ""new reality"". It's a delusion. Not much more different than having a split personality in order to cope with severe trauma. Accepting the past is not the same as going there and taking up residence. It's learning from it. Think about it from a Black perspective. Lots of Black people use our dark past to motivate us to do better. However, there are lots of people (some Blacks included) who  say we're living in the past and need to ""get over it"". Do you see what I mean?

"Like Funkadelic said: ""america eats it young"". You deserve healthy communication and respect. The lack of it is what's most likely brought you to this point in your heart.

Your focus has to be finding the correct space for you to be a good person without it harming you. It will give you the time to center yourself and gain perspective.

What I mean is: when you go to the psychiatrist they are going to ask you if your issues were from your mother or your father, right? Most likely you're not the only one in your family suffering these things. Because you are hard on yourself, while they are not with potentially the same issues its that extra step to self harm for you.

"I appreciate all your answers from my first post in this group. I really do thank you.

But I wanted to go in depth in detail with my situation that I'm contemplating on. 

Not that I'm contemplating on dying, but the thoughts of what dying as a whole would look like for me. Or really just thinking about the possibilities of me dying and what would happen.

Or rather my question is sacrificing myself to lessen the burden on anyone in my life. 

A couple of questions I have about suicidal ideation and having the thoughts of dying are: 

If nobody wants me to die, then why does anyone care if I live or die in the first place? At least the close relationships that I have including family.

If I took my own life, wouldn't it be a better solution to erase myself from people who think I'm a burden to them or at least I am somewhat of a burden. 

If dying isn't the answer, then what purpose is it to live for myself and anyone else?   

And why does talking about suicide towards family and friends such a touchy subject? I get that it scares people into thinking that I'm thinking about dying but I haven't made the actions yet but plan to.

Then my last question is, If I have all these suicidal thoughts and the ideation of what I visualize a death for me; would therapy be this best solution to fix all of this? 

Cuz I've been contemplating about going to therapy too. The only problem is I don't have enough resources to go into therapy. Which I know I should, but at the moment I can't really go to therapy because I don't have that much to go into therapy. Money-wise. 

I just feel when people tell me to go to therapy, I understand that they don't probably want me to keep talking about the same things over and over again. Which means that I would have to process what I'm feeling and accepting it within a place that's safe for me to explain it.  

At the same time, why does it seem that if I go to therapy, people will want to talk with me and want to be around me more because I have a ""sane mind"" and not mentally ill, or depressed, or ruminating on something that really hurts me in my life?

I hope all this makes sense and hope you can help me with it. If there are any questions you want to ask I don't mind answering them."	MISTAX1995	post	22.766846676836415	female	White	0.0034989186096936464	na	na	na	1	BlackMentalHealth
I can't answer all these questions but therapy does help with S.I. greatly. I think having a better support group would help also. People are just not informed enough about mental health and the dealings of it. I used to be extremely suicidal and lots of intrusive thoughts. One thing that helped that was changing the community I surrounded myself with. Having people who are more compassionate about you and your life problems will help you a lot. People care about you dying because it's traumatic for all parties involved. People don't want to feel guilty in the case that you do, do that. Therapy is great but it's just not accessible at all. I'm sorry that you can't find an accessible option, but if you're in school, there are some resources you have. I hope that you're feeling okay.

"Hey fam. I got to a really terrible place earlier this year, due to a screw-up with my meds. My therapist helped me get in touch with a partial-hospitalization program (PHP) in my area. That's a structure where you go to a group setting for the day, voluntarily, and then go home in the afternoon/evening when you're done with your set of structured activities. 

The program I was in focused heavily on Dialectical Behavior Therapy coping techniques for a range of conditions, coupled with some other types of therapeutic approaches, like music therapy. We got a one-on-one check-in with a therapist every week, and a one-on-one check-in with a prescriber, as well. I learned a lot, and actually made some really good friends that I still keep in touch with. 

There are also virtual options for similar offerings, if you don't want to go somewhere in person.

"Hey there -- I've talked with therapists about suicide and ideation, and I've been semi-voluntarily taken to in-patient psych treatment, so I can give you a bit of sense for how mental health professionals tend to react to this kind of stuff. Obv ymmv, but here's what they tend to look for from least serious to most serious: 

* **Low concern** - passive suicidal ideation: ""I should kill myself..."" 

* **Medium concern** - planning means: ""I should kill myself by doing XYZ (like a gun).""

* **High concern** - you have a plan: ""I will kill myself next Tuesday at xyz location by doing abc, leaving this note behind in my car to explain to my mom that I tried."" 

As you go up the scale, you will run more risk of having some sort of mental health intervention. Which is good! I don't know all your circumstances but as a suicide survivor, I can say I am grateful to be here now. I'd really suggest sticking your toe in the water with your therapist and talk through having uncomfortable intrusive thoughts regarding suicide (and maybe leave out the specifics for now).

"Honestly, you‚Äôre in a uniquely difficult position‚Ä¶ you could be put in danger seeking help from your therapist, and moreso than the average person. 

But you‚Äôre in an emergency situation. That‚Äôs what it is, when you‚Äôre feeling like this‚Ä¶ an emergency. You may need an action plan that suits your needs. 

For me, I *needed* a Black therapist, period. I also needed medical (herbal and/or pharmaceutical) for stabilization (for me that‚Äôs [to-be-prescribed but I don‚Äôt care about that aspect] weed and [prescribed, and I do care about that aspect] ketamine). 

I‚Äôm supposed to take both regularly but I can‚Äôt take the ketamine the way it‚Äôs prescribed without a lot of trouble‚Ä¶ even so, I take it whenever I have suicidal ideation every 3 days at least until that goes away. 

I don‚Äôt know what your goals are but my first goal was to identify when I needed intervention and to get that before spiraling into emergency territory. 

You‚Äôre already there so there‚Äôs a clear need for some kind of intervention. I think it may be a matter finding out what‚Äôs accessible to you and what you need.

" Pretty simple and upfront question. Why don't black men go to therapy or consider it? 

I ask bc my BF clearly needs it. On top of having a not so good childhood, he recently had his brother pass making the mental state even worse. I've been to therapy before (going back) and I love it. 

And with his bro being the only male figure in his life, I know he's lost. Everything is unfortunately falling apart and my solution to him was to find someone to talk to and get guidance from vs bottling it up. 

What are some ways to encourage someone to seek help? Or is that a thing."	Lolalitab	post	21.599475189953253	female	White	0.004340846557170153	na	na	na	8	BlackMentalHealth
"I have a very long answer - as a black woman therapist. Lol

But the short answer is that usually black men are raised without much accountability and responsibility. (ETA: this is not a dig at or meant to shame black men but a hard (er) truth. Often black women bare many responsibilities and are culturally held accountable/responsible for things that we shouldn‚Äôt be. It‚Äôs hard as a black woman to unlearn those things and give ourselves grace, too. But this is a struggle I‚Äôve seen that makes therapy seem harder to initiate, and a barrier that some women have less difficulty with.) Going to therapy means both being responsible and holding yourself/others accountable; doing that for the first time as an adult can be difficult, off putting, discouraging, and often can result in defensiveness (which also doesn‚Äôt feel good). It also takes being self aware which is extremely difficult and harder if you don‚Äôt have the emotional intelligence to process those things. In addition to dealing with being a black man in society today.

Dealing with trauma (childhood or otherwise) is hard for anybody. But at some point it becomes *scary*. And then the stigma of therapy meaning something is wrong with you. I hope he finds the help he needs and you take care of and protect yourself."	Lolalitab	reply	na	na	na	0.004340846557170153	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"I‚Äôd say not going to therapy is not only limited to black men. 

boys are very emotionally expressive, and as they age, they begin to shoulder the burden of fitting into a very narrow definition of masculinity; individualism over community, self reliance over shared experience, emotional disconnection over vulnerability. 

Adult men are generally numbed the fuck out and isolated. 

My next point is that therapy is slow work, and it‚Äôs not a thing you do once a week, it‚Äôs a thing you practice all the time. Lots of people choose antidepressants over therapy thinking therapy is a waste of time or that the pill will do all of the lifting. I take antidepressants and I think it‚Äôs insane anyone would skip over the therapy part of healing. 

Therapy is also expensive and the good therapists normally don‚Äôt accept insurance or if they do, you‚Äôre still accountable for a fuckload of money month over month. 

So, it‚Äôs slow hard work, that‚Äôs expensive and men aren‚Äôt comfortable with being vulnerable or touching upon unsafe or scary parts of their own minds/histories 

I think one way therapy could be presented is through a trusted friend. Most of my bros are in therapy or have done a lot of work and we talk about that shit, A LOT. those are my best relationships honestly. 

Another way to approach it is to have him or other men understand that they are in pain and therapy is a way to address the pain. You can decide to accept the pain and limp through life or you can fix what‚Äôs broken and control your destiny."	Lolalitab	reply	na	na	na	0.004340846557170153	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"Boys get to grow up and men. Girls are suppose to grow up to become women but everyone (men) wants women to remain 'girls' forever and we try to maintain that girly thing. 'Girls' are thought to be innocent, young, tight, youthful, vibrant, fertile, beautiful, malleable, desired, dependent. 'Women' are seen as old, rigid, saggy, aging beauty, demanding, costing more, wanting more, worth less. Women who can't change this try to live with this perpetual girlhood.

In checking the resources of this subreddit, they got 'therapy for Black girls' and 'therapy for Black MEN.' I'm especially irked by 'girls' being used opposite of 'man' in the same sentence or subject.

It's because of society and values that it has instilled into us. Women's sexual value in society decreases as they grow older because their looks fade. Men's sexual value in society increase as they grow older because they accumulate more resources, experience, money, importance etc. I think that men prefer younger women because younger women are looking for casual hookups and sex whereas older women are looking for to settle down, have a family etc..

"The newest addition to my altar/'sacred space' is the graduation bear. Found it at the grocer and it was marked down significantly so I bought it. I have finally turned in everything for my certificate nursing program and hope to be chosen and successful at completing it. If all goes well I will bridge to a certificate nursing program with emphasis on behavioral health. I have never graduated from anything or wore a graduation gown so the bear is my reminder and motivator that I can and will do this.   

I'm an atheist and still find this sacred space altar to be a helpful place to focus on myself, affirm my own feelings, and to uplift myself. I don't have friends or supportive family so all my support, motivation, and cheerleadeing is from myself. Included are my favorite pictures of me, pics of my family ( kids and the ancestors who have passed over), motivational quotes, my 'goddesses' that I've imbued with qualities I like (Medusa is a favorite), an RBG ankh, rocks and crystals (like amethysts and jade), tarot cards ('Black Goddess Rising'), oracle cards (the one with the owl), scented beeswax candles, a scrying mirror, favorite stuffed animals. I'm still adding stuff because part of the therapeutic value is decorating it. I will be adding dried herbs to the bottles and want a miniature waterfall.  I had an aloevera plant here but my cat kept knocking it over or nibbling on it. 

I've done a few 'spells' here. I don't think they worked but the act itself, talking aloud (I make up my own words and rhymes) , and my background sounds (tibetan bowls, Tina Turner chanting, or thunderstorm sounds) helps clear my head and makes me feel better.

"I‚Äôm a Black woman with natural hair, and, honestly, I struggle a lot with it. I have depression, and sometimes when it‚Äôs really bad I struggle with things like basic hygiene and it feels like a huge chore just to shower and brush my teeth. As a result, hair care tends to fall to the wayside for me. Often times I‚Äôll just throw on a bonnet, wrap a scarf around it, and then call it a day. As a result, my hair will become very tangled and unkempt, which just makes me put off dealing with it even more. I like protective styles because of the lack of maintenance, but I‚Äôll often procrastinate taking them out until my hair is already really raggedy. I think that two main things contribute to this for me (aside from the general depression): 

1) I was super tender headed growing up, and I, frankly, still am as an adult. As a result, hair care was always this thing I really dreaded and have all kinds of negative associations with. 

2) I have anxiety in addition to my depression, and it‚Äôs very crippling for me. I put things off until they get really bad, and I‚Äôm forced to deal with them. I do this with cleaning. I do it with schoolwork. I do it with talking to people. I do it with my hair.  

So, since I just finished detangling and twisting my hair after letting it start to get matted, I was wondering if I was alone in this or if anyone else had a similar struggle.

"Glad I'm not the only one for whom showering and hygiene is a chore. I tend only do that when I'm going to work or going on an outing. When I'm not going to work or on an outing, I spend my days lounging naked at home and don't do none of that shit. 

My hair always gets combed because I'm always playing in it and it bugs me. Like I'm watching television and my hands go to my hair to feel it, smooth it, wrap it around my fingers. Then I'm like ""uh, it's so dry and I hate these frizzy ends. Think I'll trim and do a deep conditioner. Then I grease and plait it up which I find relaxing to do.  

But I do get tired of it. I never wear it out and down because it tangles and dries out. And I still get dry hair and frizzy ends and I get tired of the look. I'm trying to grow it out but I think of chopping it off frequently. I had bald and short dos a ton of times before so I'm not scared of short hair or being voluntary bald. I just hate starting the grow out phase again.

And you can wash and reuse the hair if you‚Äôre having trouble financially taking care of it. I leave the same ones in for 1-3 months.

And the only maintanence I have is shampooing it every couple weeks if I remember and since my hair produces enough of its natural oils I don‚Äôt put any other products in it after I style it.

"How many Black women have heard this from Black men when those men are suffering a mental and emotional and mental health crisis? 

Men rely a lot on women for their emotional labor.  Women are seen as comforting naturers and men understand that and use that. But while men seek out women for emotional and psychological comfort, the last thing a woman needs is a man when she has emotional and mental health issues because he's usually the one that caused them and men can not, will not, reciprocate the emotional support and labor she needs. Men are generally emotionally void and have low empathy and low emotional IQ. 

Women have grown tired of being an emotional dumping ground for men and then trivialized and disregarded as being 'crazy' or just ignored and disregard at all. Or them putting it down to their basic instinct, ""my dick can solve that."" 

Now more women are saying ""nope, I don't wanna hear it. Seek therapy"" and men are aggy over it. They been entitled to women's emotional labor for so long that ""seek therapy"" sounds like a dismissive insult. It is dismissive, but it also speaks that men need to do what women have been doing all along, and that's looking outside of hetero relationships to help with your mental emotional health and stop relying on women to take care of you there. Get a therapist, read books, yoga, exercise, celibacy, meditation, brotherhood circle, walk in nature, listen to audio books and nature sounds, create an altar/sacred space, etcetera.

"I learned way too late in life that if you want to be happier you have to give everyone around you and yourself grace. And stop putting so much pressure on everything to be perfect because it‚Äôs never going to happen. 

No one has a perfect life or a perfect anything. Nothing in life is perfect and just about everything is messy and has no rhyme or reason. You have to teach yourself to be grateful, to roll with the punches, and to figure out what really matters to you.

We each get to decide what is important or we can let society decide for us and go on a wild goose chase trying to live up to the standards of an antiBlack world.

Our ideas of what‚Äôs perfect are largely based on the standards set by the most selfish, opportunistic, racist, sexist, ableist, classist parts of society. Society isn‚Äôt genuine and you‚Äôre going to continue to feel awful if you keep trying to live up to the world‚Äôs standards. And doing that will only worsen your mental health. 

It sounds so cliche but you need to be yourself. Differentiate what‚Äôs important to society and what‚Äôs important to you. If you find the things you truly care about are lacking take baby steps towards improving yourself, for you, not for applause from strangers, family, or insta. 

We live short lives compared to things like trees that have been around for a thousand years or planets that live for a billion. Don‚Äôt waste your precious time chasing perfection or praise from other people because it may never come. Live a bit selfishly according to what YOU care about then support, praise, and nurture yourself. Give yourself an abundance of grace. We‚Äôre just humans and it‚Äôs just life.

If you wanna make friends get some hobbies or do volunteer work where you can meet people with similar interests. I‚Äôd also suggest a therapist and antidepressants if you don‚Äôt already have them. I started taking antis and I‚Äôm still amazed at what a difference it makes like my severe mental illness was the tip of the iceberg but in a good way it is not all of who I am‚Ä¶.beneath the surface was my entire personality I‚Äôm funny af, I smile and giggle a lot, instead of resting bitch face I find myself smiling while in idle lol. If your current meds aren‚Äôt doing the trick speak to a professional about your other options. 

You gotta take some of the pressure off yourself and others if you wanna enjoy any part of life. My motto is ‚Äúloosey-goosey‚Äù meaning imprecise, disorganized, or excessively relaxed. Am I always like this hell no, but when I feel myself taking life or other people too seriously I remind myself to be loosey-goosey or to ‚Äúgo around the leaf‚Äù to quote A Bug‚Äôs Life. When something‚Äôs not working find another way, find your way, and if you need to you can even decide you don‚Äôt care and move on to something else.

"Some months ago, I wrapped up a 100 page surreal thriller I had been working on for about a year. I was hiding my struggles behind metaphors, but as I slowly started adding a plot, I realized I started using this story as a way to process things. Feeling prey to self-harm urges, fighting them back, snapping and feeling/seeing fantasies that are not there, shame and depression, anger, etc. I wrote it all down; the story is parallel with my own journey. My former therapist at the time helped me remember 'trauma' when I was finishing up the story, so I left off on that. Then I was referred to adult therapy and my quality of life has been improving, I think.

Recently I decided to try a sequel; I've been changing after all, right? At first, I thought ""Well I'm feeling great recently so this sequel might not work out."" Then I continued past the prologue to where I left off. I am on the part where my character's family is reacting to the problems they found out about, and I parallel it with my own experience, and suddenly I'm remembering when my own family found out, and then when my family found out that I didn't ""just stop"" some time later. I found myself constantly stopping, and that shameful inner voice started attacking me almost out of nowhere. I hit a soft spot; fair. So I write the worst of that part and move on to the family dynamic part, and of course I try to parallel it with my own experience. Turns out I can't even start that part, so I stop and 3d model for the night. This was yesterday.

This morning I woke up to do some actual work and I opened my laptop to a tab of my story on Wattpad I was using as reference. This chapter was, essentially, a parallel to when I started remembering my reactions to household tension; my character was comforting his little sisters. When I recognized the chapter I was looking at, this inner critic remembers a vent I wrote a while ago, and the sequel I'm writing, and starts screaming at me that I'm exaggerating what I went through, and names all the reasons that it's normal, that I'm weak, and I'm fighting back but failing for the first time in a while.

Then memories start coming back. And this time they have emotions attached to them.

I feel like I'm there again. I feel like nothing, I feel 12 again, pushing away helplessness with the delusion that I could get mom to be happy again and dad to stop yelling at her if I just work harder to keep the house clean and start selling things to help mom keep the lights and water on and help mom accomplish the dreams that dad sabotaged. Then therapy knowledge kicks in and I become confused, stuck between ""I should help more"" and ""I should focus on myself"", between ""everyone your color experiences this childhood, grow up, it could be worse"" and ""what I experienced was actually damaging"". Then I dissociate, falling in and out of sleep and pain, balled up on the floor for six hours and holding an emotional-support bear like a child. In short, this is one of the worst breakdowns I've experienced in a minute.

I thought I was getting better by learning coping mechanisms and keeping myself busy. I thought that working and creating things all day would keep the thoughts and voices away; I stay up long working just so I'm not kept up at night with anxieties. I guess I was just burying uncomfortable things. They always find themselves back in my head again. I don't know if I'm getting better now.

"Hey, fam. That sounds like a whole lot to deal with. And your reaction sounds really valid. 

One thing I want to put out there, which sounds very ""Instagram inspirational,"" but I've had to remind myself of a lot, is that healing is not linear. ""Getting better"" has a lot of ups and downs, and they can sneak up on you sometimes. And it's an especially long process when those hurts are inflicted in childhood.

You're doing something brave and beautiful, by working on yourself and seeking healing. It's a skill set, as much as a state of being, and it takes a lot of practice. I think you're experiencing that, as you see those new skills from ""therapy knowledge"" start to butt heads with the old ways of disordered/abusive messages you've been given in the past. You will grow stronger in your knowledge and conviction of what is correct. And if you need additional validation, I will co-sign: your experiences were damaging, fam. Even if everyone your color had those experiences, they would still be damaging, and that would still not be okay.

"One thing I've noticed is that you consistently show up here, and reach out, and seek connection, and I honestly think that's a good sign. I know it's tough. It's rough as hell out there, sometimes, and you're going through a lot. 

That being the case, maybe shift your focus from ""improving"" to ""moving forward?"" There are a lot of pressures and a lot of stress on you at the moment, and adding more pressure to ""improve"" when you're basically fighting to exist isn't really fair to you. Don't worry about figuring yourself out, or reaching new heights, or getting breakthroughs. Just hunker down and focus on acquiring a new therapist, would be my advice. 

Take it one step at a time. Maybe make yourself a list or a plan, if that's something that helps ease your mind, and do one step per day, if that's what you feel up to. Give yourself grace, and some slack.

"As the title says, im a bit overwhelmed. A lot has happened within my relationship,  one being the unfortunate loss of my bfs brother which so happens to be my friend as well. So things have been shaky since last August. Outside of just trying to be there the best way I can, there's been a lot of financial strains. Even prior to his bro passing its always been that way. In my head im just like ""dude! C'mon!"" But its kind of hard to say anything now bc his mind is in a haze. He's lost without his brother. And I get that. But its also hard. A lot of what he's said hasn't become a reality yet and it's been 5 yrs. The marriage, house, etc. I've saved, killed debt and taught myself the basics of finances and has tried to bring him along but he never really gave it a chance. Its just been eating at me if he truly wants this to work or if he understands what it truly takes to make it work..financially. unfortunately, love doesn't buy things or pay bills, and I've stressed to him how we should prepare and get ahead but its never the case. Im slowly veering off to just do my own thing, which I know I shouldve never stopped doing to begin with. But its hard for someone with such a big heart like mine..but im also suffering and getting sucked dry.

"Im gonna start by saying this, this is an extremely difficult situation to navigate and theres a big chance you‚Äôre not exactly happy with whatever decision you make.

Im a firm believer in the belief that love shouldnt be a struggle. There seems to be a difference in the pace at which you want things done. He may have said he wanted to accomplish all of these things in 5 years but his actions show that that‚Äôs not necessarily the case. His inability to follow through after 5 years also demonstrates a lack reliability which can really kill a relationship (especially when finances arent straight). So i totally see the case for moving on with your life.

On the other hand‚Ä¶ while i think love can be easy to find, compatibility isn‚Äôt. So you have to ask yourself if you think you‚Äôll be able to find a life partner as compatible with you as your current bf. By compatibility I mean things like values, views on things like lifestyle, politics/social issues, how to raise children, etc. To find out if you‚Äôre truly compatible, you gotta take an outside look in on your relationship so love doesn‚Äôt cloud your judgment. If you feel like you REALLY have that with him, your relationship is 100% worth saving.

Im getting long winded here but here‚Äôs one last thought‚Ä¶ Have you ever thought about being more proactive in achieving the marriage, house, secured finances? If you feel like this is truly your ‚Äúguy‚Äù for life, why not ask him to marry you? Why not get yourself in position to be the breadwinner who can afford the house and secured finances while he supplements you. Additionally have you considered if your financial, marriage and house goals are realistic? Not sure how old you are but alot of us put unneeded stress on ourselves by pushing deadlines for no reason. Theres no rule saying you have to be married by X age or that you should have a house by X age. If thats really what you want go get it but you cant really wait up and expect someone else to do it for you.

"I'm sorry for your bf's loss. That's hard to lose a relative. My husband just lost his mama a couple of weeks ago so we are dealing with the fallout of that. And we are also in a sticky financial situation haha. 

Have you spoke with your bf about how you've been feeling? I think that's the first and most important step. It's best to start the conversation using ""I"" statements: ""When you did [insert behavior], I felt [insert emotion] because [insert reason]."" 
For example: ""When you told me that you'd take out the trash and you didn't, I felt disappointed because you promised me you would.""

On the other hand, it's important to remember that your bf has suffered a recent loss. Everyone deals with grief differently so that may also affect the way he is behaving right now."	Lolalitab	reply	na	na	na	0.9979588985443115	strong	strong	strong	na	BlackMentalHealth
im a little confused as to what exactly is going on in ur relationship or what ur asking for advice with, but from what you've said it sounds like ur at a turning point where ur going in ur own direction and your partner isn't following. you're growing and he's struggling. he's made promises and he hasn't kept them in 5 years -- which is a very long time so it indicates that this issue goes deeper than his recent grief. I don't rly know why you say ur overwhelmed bc from this post it actually sounds like you're thriving and growing! but unfortunately u can't force a partner to heal and stabilize especially after years of promises that have not come to fruition.

"You are entitled to feel every single emotion you have. There is nothing wrong with that. The emotions you are feeling sound like they are trying to warn you away from a questionable interaction, and you're listening to them. That's a very good thing. Emotions help us understand people and circumstance in a much more intuitive fashion than logical reasoning. 

Similarly, there is nothing at all wrong about being an introvert and preferring to keep a level of space and reserve for yourself. It's every bit as valid and okay as anyone else.

Telling people 'no' is hard! Especially when there are layers of social obligation like so often happens with families. That doesn't mean you need to roll over for them though. I'd suggest trying to find your family member while they are not drinking and having the conversation then. Drunk people are seldom reasonable. Find an excuse, and use it to get out of the obligation. That way instead of saying 'no' and maybe starting a scene, you can claim you're too busy and keep things low key. Your excuse can be anything they would accept, true or not. You have to do what keeps you safe and well, and that can include keeping secrets or telling lies if needed."		reply	na	na	na	0.9990090131759644	weak	no	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"Your feelings are definitely valid. mental health is studied and a really important aspect of health as has been repeatedly indicated by scientists and doctors. Unless ur parents have studied medicine don't listen to them. It sounds like ur parents are the typical black parents. My dad and mom say the same things. They say ""Life is great, my life is hard, you should be happy."" When in reality things like therapy are absolutely necessary for someone struggling with mental health. Truth be told, a lot of black parents actually do have mental health issues but theyre just repressed and they feel bitter when they see their children not repressing anxiety and depression like they did. But repression just makes it worse and worsens the problems in the black community.

Im rly glad u go to therapy. thats a great start. I'd make a plan w your therapist to go to ur job interviews although u are scared. lastly, stop expecting your parents to support you emotionally bc you cant change people. rely on your therapist and mental health workbooks until you feel like you're coping with your anxiety and depression a bit better."

AAVE is hated, rap and hip hop is generally hated, the inner cities and ghetto environment is generally hated, even predominant black success and black history is generally hated. Of course not all the time but given the very limited subreddits we have outside of a few cliche subreddits, we don't really have much of an accepted presence on here but reddit has no issues having 50 subreddits dedicated to touching themselves fetishizing about our women, a lot of those subreddits with 100x the amount of members our limited black subreddits have. I get it that redditors are a bunch of porn obsessed incels but how hypocritical you have to be to dislike our culture and people so much yet have the audacity to sit there fetishizing about us?

Reddit is quite the toxic place in general, best thing is to not read into it too seriously.  I receive a lot of backlash on many subreddits.  Also with the sheep mentality to see someone say something negative, then want to follow afterwards.  Black women always do seem to be more accepted than black men, because I feel they don't feel threatened by them as do by us black men.

It's because of power. It goes way back to when blacks and whites saw each other the same. Back then we almost ran this country ourselves- that was bacon's rebellion. When we lost they invented the slave codes and black people were always treated a little worse than whites who are treated poorly. And that dynamic updates itself over history because without it we would come together again. That's why king only died when he started the poor people's movement and x only died after his hajj and burying the hatchet w ytes. That's why jim crow only started a generation after the civil war and those statues didn't go up until people who actually fought died, because those people were drafted bc they didnt own any slaves. And that's why now white people run the democratic party even though most whites are republicans. That's going to bleed into peoples sexual behavior	JussaQuestion4	reply	na	na	na	0.9954978227615356	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"Bc most Reddit users solely use it as a porn site. They aren‚Äôt necessarily the same ones stereotyping us. Hence why those subreddits have so many more members. Folks just jerk off and close the app. Reddit discussion is for the chronically online where as the majority of men view porn.

Another reason is bc simply put every single group that is a possible porn category has a ton of subreddits. It‚Äôs not exclusive to BW. 

And lastly for the people who do hate our culture but still jerk off to us ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs bc they have cognitive dissonance.

I noticed that while looking for a safe space to talk about my mental health struggles with people who look like me. I'm having a really hard time since moving to a new state with my bf and I just don't feel like I have anybody to talk to about my feelings. I worked so hard back home to get the little piece of what I called mine. Now I feel like I traded it all in for magic beans. I don't have a job here or any family. My literal only contribution are my state benefits that allow me to buy groceries, and cooking/cleaning for him and his children. I feel stupid and old and washed up and I'm not even in my 30s yet. Everything I thought my life would be are just that: thoughts. I'm so sad for the little girl inside of me because I know I let her down.

And I do. Lately I feel like I‚Äôve been on this quest.. to find my own happiness is to say the least. I know we all get here and go through things like this, the tipping point? When you go from the childish mind to the adults. I know I‚Äôve heard countless people tell me since I could remember ‚Äúeveryone‚Äôs experiences and paths are unique,‚Äù I don‚Äôt think they went into depth enough. These quest we find ourselves on are a trip, lol a big ass trip. I know mine has been like a big epiphany, sitting in time today and writing about this now, that‚Äôs how it feels. Like a big oh yeah or wow duh moment. When I think about life and all the things I‚Äôve heard about this thing, there‚Äôs never really anything you can ever say to a person that will make them understand what you mean the way experiences do. You can drop a hint or say an old saying but nothing makes that statement more truer than the actual experience. Again I heard so much growing up, from depressed family members who missed opportunities to go to college, from my moms grown up girlfriends who came over gossiping about the latest family members choice in lifestyle, from addicts drunken on the bus benches who had stolen from their own children, from women who‚Äôd lost faith by lusting but managed to be back on Sunday being prayed upon.. ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be like me, love yourself first, live life, don‚Äôt drink or do a drug, don‚Äôt chase after love.‚Äù I heard that so much that I should‚Äôve seen the signs when I got to going down the wrong roads right? Should have listened to myself when I yelled out ‚Äúturn around!‚Äù I should‚Äôve guarded myself more, been more softer with myself.. I should have known better right? When I think about that thought now.. ‚Äúknowing better,‚Äù I see how impossible that actually was. The other day I was reading a book of poems by Warsan Shire, I think the one that‚Äôs on my mind is called ‚ÄúHome.‚Äù In it she was saying that nobody really leaves home unless they have to, unless home is a mouth of a shark or a barrel of a gun is what she said and I felt the relevancy in my soul. My home had been burned to the ground by 12 and I was moved into the mouth of a shark just like she wrote about. Love was an illusion to me at this time, something for film and fiction books. I never really felt loved or valued or protected when I moved into the mouth of that shark.. all I knew was that it didn‚Äôt welcome me. I knew the mouth of a shark protected me from the black of the sea but it was still black itself in there. Still cold. Still dangerous and painful if you brushed the wrong way. I knew I had to leave the first chance I got or remain unhappy forever. Chewed and ground up, overtime torn to unrecognizable chum. How could I have ever learned to see these signs people always talked about when I was planning my escape? How could I heed the warning of other dangers in the water when I already felt in danger? Today I have to confront my shark and it‚Äôs mouth I once inhabited and you know what? I welcome the challenge. Since leaving that sharks mouth I‚Äôve gotten to where I am today, able to write this beautiful entry.	indytheslayyerr	post	27.934296129456254	female	White	0.0018478628480806947	na	na	na	1	BlackMentalHealth
"Eloquently put. Or at least. I think I get it and what you've written resonates with me deeply. Even if you're some weird machine learning, race-baiting text output algorithm. (I'm not super trusting in these online spaces.) But I'm commenting because I think I get it. I think you're referring to how much the warnings and advice and guidance you're offered throughout your life isn't as helpful as it seems like it should be. It didn't quite paint a vivid and full enough picture of a life lived. It doesn't make for lessons truly learned or a guiding light in your owned lived experiences. Especially when you're forced out of home by tragedy or trauma or the realization that home was never a home. I feel like it's hard to find a compass for navigating emotional, intellectual, personal (spiritual?) growth without a home. Everyone telling you to do this or avoid that are just voices, whispers, ghosts to a person without a ground to stand on. Feeling fulfilled is most difficult when there's no clear sense of your base, your home, what vessel it is you're trying to fill. It's hard to learn in some ways when you're unmoored. But you nonetheless learn so much. You feel so much. You think so much.

">> To start, off, I am not professionally diagnosed with anything. Outwardly, I‚Äôm a relatively stable guy. 

Although diagnoses have their time, place, and usefulness in our world, I think that ultimately, we know when something is wounding us. Whatever it is, is definitely valid on its own.

>> I don‚Äôt really remember a period of my life, primarily from 6th grade until 9th grade, all too well. It‚Äôs one big blur, no defining moments. 

This is a pretty common feature of trauma. It‚Äôs also a common feature of trauma to be guarded *about* that trauma. When you experienced a memory resurfacing, it sounds like it was a really overwhelming experience and that you struggled with having confronted it in that moment, and then (understandably) avoided confronting it further. 

For what it‚Äôs worth, expression is a form of therapy. It‚Äôs a form of release... the kind of release that goes hand in hand with healing trauma. If you think of trauma like a wound from a weapon that‚Äôs been left behind (whether in whole or in part) it makes sense that at some point, that weapon needs removed and it‚Äôs pieces being removed promotes healing and allows a wound to progress to a healthy scar. 

You can engage in that process of release in a number of ways. Even if talking is too much, it could help you to write, or make visual art or music (or dance) as a way to express what‚Äôs happened and what‚Äôs going on inside of you.

"Outwardly I seem nice, kind, engaging, articulate, and intelligent. Most of my employment was in the social service public sector. I get along well with people. Its looking very favorable that I'll be starting vocational nursing school in the fall. I have a romantic relationship and wonderful children that I have a close bond with. 

I'M DYING! 

I have no friends and I don't trust anyone to be my friend because of how I was treated in the past. I was used and disregarded by those I felt close to. Even tho I consider it their loss (because I know I'm a great friend), I'm suffering the consequences of that though distrust. I'm superficially engaging, open, and honest but I'm afraid of anyone getting close to me. I'll grow more distant if they do and I'll self-sabatage any romantic inclinations. I'm generally shy and introverted and always have been. When I was younger I was also quiet and afraid. I was socially awkward, socially inept, and rejected outcast. I gradually got over that in adulthood and became more outgoing, outspoken, and honed my communication skills to have better conversations and discussions. 

Social media was a godsend for a socially inept introvert. I found my 'tribe' and started going to social gatherings. Got a few friends and lovers. Was doing ok socially. 

Then it all ended. Badly. 

Now I'm reverting not only back to being shy and introverted but also an asocial and antisocial hermit. I'm becoming misanthropic, agoraphobic, and don't wanna leave my house. I dread casual interactions with the outside world. I hate when people talk to me and make casual conversation. I want to be invisable to them, to everyone. I became addicted to social media (Facebook) because I craved connection, but I keep getting constant suspensions and everytime it happens it spikes my depression, anger, and there's a heavy feeling of... something... in my head and chest. This latest suspension had me crying and I *rarely* cry. That was how much it hurts. 

An associate recommended Reddit. He said I could discuss anything here and it's less censorship than Facebook. This is a fucking dumpster fuck. I do make controversial topics and I might be a little crude in my replies, but overall I'm respectful and sensitive and only reply to those who are respectful and sensitive to me. 
So the downvotes were discouraging but I pestered on. Then I got called a 'coon' which is outright offensive. And this was a Black-specific subreddit. This ain't my safe space.  

I don't really want any advice because there is none you can give me that would be helpful. Just to know that someone understands and relates would be nice.    

I'm gonna wind up like this nurse in the show Moral Orel - employed and seemingly functional in the outside world (minus the sexual promiscuity, been there done that) but at home I'm having tea with my imaginary friends and strictly platonic imaginary lover.

"Woke up in just...THE WEIRDEST MOOD today. Could be any number of factors influencing it. Top of the list is that my dad has been battling some health problems off and on for a couple weeks, and every time it seems like he's in the clear, things take a turn. Plus, I've been working on a coming-out process, and now that some folks have gotten over the initial ""shock,"" the microaggressions are starting, because they just...don't get it, even though at a base level they want to be supportive. And that's making me sit there and wonder what it's going to be like doing this process at my job. :/

Been having weird dreams, too. And generally feeling like my feelings are too big, too loud, and too many. It's making me feel really angry, and I don't like it when I get like that.

I've got my online support group tonight, which is good. I really want to get away and go walk around for a while before then, but I don't want to leave my husband alone with our toddler, after they've been alone together all day while I was at work, and they're going to be alone in the evening while I'm at group.

"I just recently discovered why I've always received ""random"" hatred from people all my life, especially people I considered my friends.


I'm completely oblivious to social cues, and will frequently miss obivous signs or signals of interest or a call for help. I also withdraw frequently as I'm always used to being the social outcast.


The few people that do have the heart to show me love eventually get frustrated when I don't reciprocate or miss cues to expand the relationship, and then it crumbles...


I'm in my late twenties. I was supposed to have been in treatment since kindergarten. Literally learned today that when you make social gaffes or miss cues, the socially acceptable thing is to *not* call attention to it! You're supposed to be in programs that will actually teach you social skills, as if you're learning Algebra.


My parents were so fucked up, overwhelmed, abused, abusive and lonely that I came up alone for my entire life with no guidance aside from beatings and rage fits from my parents when I slipped up.


As a result, I always come off as aloof, severely independent, arrogant, holier-than-thou, sociopathic, etc. Especially since I took great pains to improve my physical self and career in an attempt to build self esteem. So I got bullied *a lot*, had people do *mad* fucked up shit to me, and then I have to develop a tough exterior to weather all that.


But nah, I'm not supposed to kill myself! I'm supposed to sit here and suffer, and any good soul who's kind enough to help will then suffer with me. Weekly CBT isn't enough, but the process to get sufficient help takes a long time. And until then I'm just supposed to sit here unintentionally hurting good people through my aloofness.


And with this abortion bullshit the Republicans are trying to do, and the lack of sufficient mental healthcare in this shithole country, belive that there will be more bastards like me in the world. Little sociopathic dickheads scurrying around poisoning people that even attempt to try and offer some help.


That's why I'm so stuck. I should not have made it this far, I should have already killed myself a long long time ago but stubbornly didn't. It's like you're playing a game with a messed up cartridge and wondering why everything is acting weird. Fool, you should have *been* threw out the damn cartridge."

"Try to look at it more like you having an untreated mental condition that has been neglected by those who were supposed to look after you, rather than you being some sort of menace to society and unworthy of being alive. 

I‚Äôm less than qualified to point to any sort of diagnosis , but I‚Äôd look into the autistic spectrum based on what you described. Also, remember the statistics: black ppl are severely under-diagnosed all over the globe, be it due to racism, generational trauma, the ways the medical field has used and abused our bodies over the centuries and often used mental health facilities as means of furthering segregation. That often leads to undiagnosed mental illnesses being treated as criminal and people being sent to jail, higher rates of suicide among black populations and feelings of unworthiness, a lot of which could be avoided if people had received proper psychiatric support. 

You can get help and it‚Äôs not too late to work on those issues and diminish your suffering. Talk to your GP and try to find out what resources are available to you. You said you‚Äôre already attending weekly CBT sessions, and that‚Äôs a good thing. I understand it might feel like it‚Äôs not enough, and you should voice those concerns to your doctor so that you can find a more suitable care plan.

Fuuuuuuck why am I like this.


My boyfriend told me to tell him what I was thinking, and was upset when I wouldn‚Äôt but I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt give physical voice to the stream of thoughts going through my head like ‚Äújump in the river, just jump in the river‚Äù and ‚Äúof course no one wants to spend time with you, you‚Äôre a miserable bitch‚Äù and ‚Äújust admit it, you‚Äôve been broken by all of it‚Äù and ‚Äúdo everyone a favor and fucking kill yourself‚Äù and ‚Äúthis is what it‚Äôs like to be an orphan‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôll just have to settle with being lonely like this for the rest of your life‚Äù and ‚Äúbut life can be shorter.‚Äù I was mesmerized by that river and I couldn‚Äôt stop the onslaught of insane feelings. Given the conversation that came before  this, I knew that he would interpret my telling the damn truth about my own feelings as being manipulative, which drives me fucking nuts but isn‚Äôt worth a conversation because the easy solution to that issue is to say less. He‚Äôs dealt with a lot of manipulation in his life and I can‚Äôt cope with doing the work to express the things I bottle up only to be accused of being that vulnerable and opening up and pulling down the walls I‚Äôve build my whole life to be accused of saying what was so hard to say... for the purpose of manipulation. Like I cannot begin to describe how insulting it is to me, or how defeating.

I felt like my heart was breaking last night... Because it was.

"hey, I see you. we all make mistakes and the withdrawal sensations will go away within 24 hours of getting back on your med routine.  I'm on hella medications and I slip up sometimes too, but I have to just accept that day as a ""light day"" and let shit crumble around me. you don't owe anyone your sanity and you have the right to take care of yourself. i pick fights when i'm unstable too, and i always heavily regret the aftermath. that's normal, too. 

if your boyfriend isn't an asshole, it's okay to tell him that ""this is what happens when i miss my meds, and i'm sorry for all the weirdness, but withdrawal is a bitch and in those moments i just need to get back on them as soon as possible, and be treated with kindness and compassion until i'm doing better.""

"i really need advice

so a couple weeks ago my mother was frustrated about the state of the house and had a family meeting about it. during the meeting she said that when she gives us advice on how to clean there is backlash. she then lists the ways and they mainly include what i know i'm the only one dealing with (self-harm, suicidal thoughts, anxiety spiral, etc). she wasn't saying any names and nobody really knew what she meant but i could tell some of those (not all) were about me. she says that those are weird thoughts and are considered behaviors that toddlers still deal with, before continuing the conversation and going over what responsibility means, how to take responsibility, etc. this is what i remember.

i thought to myself, well this is proof that she will never understand me, but i decided to try and see what she meant because she is a very good mom and wants the best for me. she talks to me about how she wishes she could help me with what i'm going through, especially since it revolves around my image of her being a perfect being, so i figured telling her what doesn't help might be worthwhile. so a few days later i went to her and told her i was uncomfortable with her saying that those were weird thoughts and toddler behavior. she then tells me ""you don't think harming yourself is weird?"" i didn't know what to say because sometimes i would tell myself that it was weird, out of self-hatred to make myself feel invalid. she then points to the toddler thing and says the conversation wasn't just about me, and mentions how she feels lost because any attempt to correct me is in vain when i feel hurt about it later. 

she then has an idea to give me a research assignment on 1) listening vs hearing 2) different stages of growth and development from childhood to adulthood and 3) synonyms for weird. i knew it wasn't going to help but i mean, who argues with a black mom.

i do the assignment and it doesn't help me with shit. i forget to hand it in to her and that's where today comes in.

today she reminds me that she needed the assignment two weeks ago. i get frustrated and make a comment about how it's an assignment to make me understand how my thoughts are weird. she then  tells me that she's entitled to her own opinion and that the assignment is to help build up mental fortitude. she says that she looked up toddler behavior and that was what helped her in her personal life as well.  she says she wishes i could understand her heart and gives a blanket apology for anything she's ever done, and i tell her i don't know what she could be apologizing for because she never really makes mistakes. she says she doesn't know either but it's obviously needed because somewhere trust was broken. 

i'm posting this because i feel like my attempt to help her understand me and tell her what can be offensive to me went in vain. but then again maybe i was just being too sensitive and taking a simple comment too far. am i just going about it the wrong way? am i just misunderstanding what she meant and that these thoughts are considered weird? i turned an adult recently and want to have a mature conversation with her, but a childish part of me just wants to be hugged by her for a while and to be heard without having to be fixed. maybe it's selfish. i don't know. this situation is confusing to me like always and i'd like another voice to help me out.

i have talked to my therapist about it and she says that my mom is a wonderful person but not perfect. it doesn't make sense in my head and i can tell my stubbonness is taking a toll on my therapist. but now i am wondering if my mom actually made a mistake she wasn't aware of through her comments, or if i'm just being extra sensitive and need to woman up a little. maybe that's why this has been a big deal to me for a while. i don't know how much more womaning up i can do lol"	am_a_mysterious_alt	post	24.202631506698346	female	White	0.9965147376060486	na	na	na	4	BlackMentalHealth
"How old are you? You sound like an adolescent. I felt the way you feel toward your mom when I was your age. 

But i don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre in the wrong. Your mom does not understand mental illness or mental health. So do not expect her to. She is stigmatizing your mental health symptoms by equating them to ‚Äúbaby-like‚Äù or ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù. My mom does this as well because he had a hard upbringing so she doesn‚Äôt seem to understand my anxiety and mental health issues given that my life seems easier than hers was growing up.

Do not expect your mom to understand your mental health. Don‚Äôt let what she says about u get to u. Just do the assignment and move on. 

Keep using your therapist as a trusted resource. Other than that, I am rly sorry to hear about your suicidal thoughts, no one should have to deal with that. But there are ways to cope. I find that taking walks, journaling, drinking tea, watching my comfort show, and talking to someone I can trust rly helps.

"M29 black man. I didn't come from the most loving or supportive family so talking about emotional shii was not really a thing..I used to live with my aunt and we would split the bills but really it was me paying the majority but I wasn't complainin. A few years back my younger brother took his life due to mental health and childhood trauma we've endured..my mother screamed in my face it was my fault in front of all our family that was visiting for the funeral. I left the house a few months later and moved outta state to live with my older brother. Everything was coo at first. We'd smoked tree together, eat some snacks, talk about fine ass females, & play some video games. But after a few months with him he started acting different. I'm bisexual I should mention and so because of that my older brother didn't like the fact that my nephew (his son) was around me so much. My older brother has very bad ""toxic masculinity"" traits and sometimes can say some really dumb and hurtful shii so as a result my nieces and nephews always preferred being around me if able due to the fact Ive always been much more laid back. Well while living with my brother he slowly started to get jealous of me due to my nephew choosing to be around me all day rather than him. He would do slick shii like tell my nephew to come in his bedroom to talk and then my nephew would come tell me he said ""I don't want you around him so long"" ""don't take food from him if he order some"" lil small petty shii like that. Long story short it escalated and he eventually told me he wanted me gone. That hurt me considering all I ever did was work and love my nephews and nieces. With that I was back in my home state living with my little sister. Same as living with my brother I cleaned her house as well (cuz none of my siblings clean), bought my own hygiene products and food, and paid some of her bills. After a couple months living with her she quits her job and told me she needs help with her bills but she just wants to sit back atm and collect unemployment. Me being me I think to myself ""lil sis needs a break and needs help"" whole time Im knowin I don't have my own place and I should be working towards that right. So I go into my savings and start helping her on more bills also at this point I'm working two jobs. I would go to work everyday at either both jobs most days or at least one of em if I'm off the other one. I would get off work to a text message from my sister saying that her man is coming by so I can't be in the apartment so I would just go sit in an empty parking lot till getting the all clear. Sometimes I'd fall asleep there..still I never complained. As time passed I was still busting ass at both jobs and things were progressing nicely. I didn't have any savings since taking over the bills but it wasn't bad ya feel me until one weekend my parents went out of town and so they asked me if I could take a weekend off to watch my uncle (dads brother) who has dementia while they're gone. That weekend we just chatted, watched movies, and I gave him his meds and food. I found him dead on the couch that Sunday. Two days later my sister she told me she needed her own space and I need to go. After all her bills were caught up and she had a new job now...I said nothing and went to pack my stuff to go back to my parents since they were my only choice at this point. I only have a few clothes and some shoes but when I went to pack it all into trash bags my sister said ""can you just take your clothes because I don't want you using all my trash bags so I did..when I got back to my parents house I knew I didn't want to stay long so I found a job and started working immediately. Every night I sleep on the floor because I can't bring myself to sleep on the couch my uncle died on..I know I'm nothin special...but I'm human right? Don't I deserve some kind of peace?"

Yes! You deserve peace and contentment. You sound like a fantastic person who takes care of many people.

"reading this makes me feel rly sad for you :( but its also clear that you're so loving and caring for your family. the problem tho is that it seems like you were always there for your family so they began to take you for granted. the good thing is that that good karma and all the hard work u put into them will come back to you soon. 

but you said you do have a job now. can u find your own place or find a nice roommate or something? maybe a new place and some new hobbies or ways of expressing yourself would give u a fresh start and help u find some peace.

I think more importantly right now is that you get some type of stability to support yourself and build your own confidence by not being able to depend on them.. It almost seemed to me by reading that you are ‚Äúafraid‚Äù to be on your own..

"You absolutely deserve peace, happiness, love and a safe place. I'm so very sorry about the loss of your brother and most recently your uncle, every part about these deaths is traumatic on top of a very hard family situation. I wouldn't want to sleep on the couch either. Your heart is big and caring, you have a strong work ethic. This will take you far, you've gotten through so much already. 

Is there housing program, group housing, GBLTQ community, a roommate, a friend out of state even that can help you get into a better living environment? 

Real talk, family can be toxic. I'm sorry they took something about you and made it negative. While your parents raised you, it doesn't mean you're forever indebted to them. While it sounds like you've tried to be nothing but respectful to your parents and siblings, you're an adult and deserve to be treated with respect too. While your family may not accept every piece of you,  your feelings are always valid.

"I‚Äôm a college student at a PWI, and I don‚Äôt have many friends. My two closest friends who I talk to about personal stuff and seek support from both happen to be white. I love them both dearly, and them being white doesn‚Äôt change that. However, it does cause complications sometimes. 

For example, I got high with one of my quite friends on Friday night. When we got back to their room, they made a joke that I found offensive. Basically, my mental health got really bad last semester and I got really behind on coursework and began illicitly taking adderall. I know it was wrong, and I regret it, but it is a part of my past that I have to live with. Anyway, my friend‚Äôs roommate has ADHD and is on adderall, which they had a bottle of out. I noticed it and commented on how it brought back some bad memories for me (probably not the best thing to vocalize, but I was very very high). Jokingly, my friend told me to not steal their roommate‚Äôs adderall. I was very upset by this comment, because I felt like the implication that I would steal drugs was kind of racist. 

Today, I went out to dinner with my other close white friend. I told them about the encounter and how upset I was. They were very intentional about not validating me, and it started to bother me. To me it felt like they thought I was overreacting, so I just straight up asked them if they thought that and they replied that it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot their place to say.‚Äù Like‚Ä¶wtf? I‚Äôm not asking for expertise on racial issues, I‚Äôm asking for support as a friend, but apparently they can‚Äôt give me that, because I‚Äôm Black. And I know it‚Äôs not the same thing, but they‚Äôre trans, and I‚Äôm cis, and whenever they talk about transphobia they experience I always validate and support them, so seeing how unwilling they are to do the same for me really really hurts. 

I don‚Äôt know. Maybe I am really just overreacting about the whole thing, but I feel like I got betrayed by two of the people I trust the most in one weekend, and I feel so incredibly alone because of it. I really need more Black friends, because this is not working for me."	itsthotiana	post	23.165823910112653	male	White	0.9961579442024231	na	na	na	5	BlackMentalHealth
I feel you. If I could relive high school and college, I would have been more intentional abo ur creating a black support system. I‚Äôd recommend you distance yourself from them emotionally a bit and befriend more black people or at least poc.

"I feel you though I'm a lot older than you. Same kinds of issues in HS and college though. At least in HS I had my white friends who were part of my honors program and I had my black musician friends too to provide some balance and a sense of belonging. But, at the PWI college I attended it was much harder - many of the black students self-segregated themselves from the rest of the student body and I wasn't signing up for that - to my way of thinking, I didn't come all the way to this elite university to have a limited experience. In hindsight, I wish I'd found a way to bridge that gap and have more black friends because I experienced many of the same things you described.

Part of it is that at that age we were all still very immature and lacking in experience. I didn't know how to relate to my white classmates and they didn't quite know how to relate to me either. Nor could I relate to the bourgie black kids on campus - I was not from that kind of background. I was one of those kids working in the cafeteria and library to earn money for books. So, I was basically a fish out of water, but I should have tried harder to find my tribe.

If I have some good news for you, its that it gets easier. The workplace isn't necessarily more diverse but there is more common ground. There are professional and social orgs to help black folks fill in the gaps. I'm sure some of that exists on campus, you're just going to havr to devote the time and energy to finding it.

I do also hope you consider staying sober for awhile. I'm as guilty of the next person for over-indulging, but the thing is that its so much more dangerous both emotionally and physically for a black person to high and fucked up. It just is.

No you‚Äôre not overreacting. Let me ask, are you their only black friend? How often did you see them hang around other black people? White individuals at PWI‚Äôs still benefit from racism because it‚Äôs not happening to them. Please don‚Äôt just ignore their comments. If it bothered you, say something and let them know that was inappropriate to say. Even though universities require people to take history classes, it seems to keep repeating itself because nobody think it‚Äôs a big deal when we see the repercussions of that on the news daily. You‚Äôre right, finding the right black friends will help you overcome some challenges and allow you a space to vent. I said the right black friends because all skin folk is not kin folk, they might tell you you‚Äôre overreacting because they could be the sub population that wants to always make white people comfortable. It‚Äôs time to nip that in the bud because it‚Äôs your feelings and your feelings are valid. Making white people uncomfortable about that they did or said is not a bad thing, you could be saving them from something worse.	itsthotiana	reply	na	na	na	0.9961579442024231	weak	no	strong	na	BlackMentalHealth

"During 2020 and the beginning of 2022, I have participated in questionable behaviors relating to a group of people online (mainly online harassment). It's a long story, but we basically had more than one back-and-forth on different social media platforms over the span of multiple years. 

On my behalf, there's no way to justify my responses to the situation. I was so frustrated because it felt as if I was being smear-campaigned, but I also feel as if I'm being targeted by the same group today. I know it's weird to connect conflict to microaggressions because I'm black, but I'm not using this as a scapegoat for my behavior. I've read the microaggressions when this person/group of people implied I don't have self-expression and emulating their personal style which is basically artsy and e-girly, although we couldn't be more different. I dress different, have different interests, and I live in a rural state. The most obvious that we're both different races (she's white and I'm black).

It doesn't make the matters better that they seem to have progressive beliefs, but if it's anybody they dislike... the beliefs are thrown out the window. I'm not even only pinning this on her, some white people try to undermine black people's knowledge of anything based on their perception of black people. I don't necessarily want acceptance from her, I just think she overvalues her individuality and projects it (especially those of other races) onto them. An example is when I posted my collection of media on Reddit, a little after they posted their collection of a different medium. I also think she has a habit of trying to upstage people as someone who has been a one-upper and was surrounded by it in my freshman highschool years.

Title kind of says it all and this is largely a vent/advice thing. There is a girl in my DnD group, and I had been crushing on her for the last couple months (we‚Äôve been in this group for about a year now). We hung out a couple times with the group, then hung out with just each other. The second time we hung out, told her I had a crush, she didn‚Äôt feel the same way. That‚Äôs fine, sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt work out and I respect that. Though I still have feelings, I aim to just be a good supportive friend, but sometimes I feel like it‚Äôs hard to kind of suppress those feelings and I feel like I make decisions that a friend would make, but the air kinda feels like that may not have been the best call (that‚Äôs just me though). Honestly, at this point I‚Äôm just tryna move on so that we can continue being friends without the awkwardness on my part. I dunno, how do you all handle this stuff?

\`It's difficult but not impossible to convert this kind of situation to a low-key friendship.

"So I‚Äôve been contemplating on uploading this but I need some advice. I am a 20F and I‚Äôm currently struggling with my mental a little bit. A little backstory, my parents split up when I was 12 and I ended up living with my dad. Although I‚Äôm thankful I had a roof over my head, my experience was very traumatic. 
My father is a preacher (this is important for another segment) but he‚Äôs also a narcissist. He never knew how to regulate his emotions without yelling or getting mad and as much as I want to avoid it, it‚Äôs honestly bothering me. He puts on this facade in front of the congregation that he‚Äôs doing the lords work meanwhile he treats everyone close to him like shit. I‚Äôm tired of it. I understand no one is perfect but there is just certain things you don‚Äôt do. Like I didn‚Äôt ask to be here and you‚Äôre supposed to be a parent so throwing in my face what you‚Äôve done for me, doesn‚Äôt help anything. It‚Äôs one of the reasons I‚Äôll struggle in silence before I ask for help. Whenever I needed him during the most important times of my life, he never showed up. He always had ‚Äúwork‚Äù but whenever he wanted to make time for something, it was no question about it. I wasn‚Äôt even a bad child. I graduated with a 4.0 in high school and worked but I still battled chronic anxiety and depression. It‚Äôs to the point where it‚Äôs been so traumatic that I can only remember the negative parts of our relationship ‚Äî barely even that ‚Äî but it‚Äôs a negative feeling around him. It‚Äôs like he literally sucks the happiness of everyone he‚Äôs around.
Fast forward to my issue now, he‚Äôs constantly asking me to come to church at least once a month. I don‚Äôt want to..mainly because I don‚Äôt associate with Christianity and I‚Äôm on a spiritual journey but I feel like that‚Äôs no one‚Äôs business except for the people I choose to disclose it to. (Ironic I‚Äôm telling a whole bunch of strangers lol) Even if I did tell him, it would be the end of the world and he would just try to force it on me. I don‚Äôt like being around him because he has the emotions of a toddler and it‚Äôs mentally draining & he won‚Äôt seek professional help. I know that I need to cut him off but I feel really bad. I know I shouldn‚Äôt but I have no idea what to do. Literally the only reason I have to deal with him now is because my little sister (who I‚Äôm very close with) still lives with him. I get so sad seeing her go through the same thing but I‚Äôm glad we have each other.

Summary: I don‚Äôt know how to set my boundaries with my father and it‚Äôs starting to affect me even though I‚Äôm trying to ignore it. What is some advice I could use from someone who has gone through the same thing?

i got past being bullied in middle school after processing it and being in a safer environment. i haven't yet got over another trauma(?) where my dad was emotionally abusive to my mother for majority of my childhood. i believe you can get over trauma. i mean the memories never go away and you can feel emotions when recalling them, but they don't pop up unannounced all like that, and most importantly they no longer dictate your habits.

I agree with a few others; I don‚Äôt believe it ever goes away completely, but you learn how to cope with it making it so it‚Äôs not the very forefront of your being.

" This is not at all meant to be an attack or anything like that, but a question I was just curious on. I don't see how any black person could get into a relationship with a white person and stay in one. Dealing with racism when in a relationship between a black and white person seems impossible to deal with because you have to constantly spell out how a situation is racist to white people and they just don't seem to get it.

The only time white partners seem to be able to acknowledge when a racist behavior is occurring is when the aggressor is outright aggressive acting. But the subtle crap flies over their heads a majority of the time.

Next, don't get me started on how so many don't really seem interested in us and appear to just be fulfilling some fetish of theirs. Honestly though there have been quite a few white people who I have dated who have said some questionable things to say the least that sounded weird.

There are more things that I can go over which makes staying committed to a white person not seem worth it but was just curious on what you have to say, thank you."	Outside_Leopard_5818	post	28.283294251733473	male	White	0.9901464581489563	na	na	na	3	BlackMentalHealth
"Thanks for your question and labeling it as a serious one. This is def something that I struggled with growing up. I grew up in predominantly white and non-Black areas, so I had to learn ways to cope and manage. 

For this post when I mention racism Im mostly talking about anti-Black racism.

First, let me say that racism doesn't start and end with White folks. There are non-Black folks that engage in anti-Black racism as well: Latinx, Asian, Indian, etc. I've experienced this first hand growing up and there is history to back this up as well ('cause slavery and segregation wasn't only in America). Overtly and subtly, I've had Black men (and non-Black men) tell me that they don't date Black women because we're ""too loud"" or ""nag too much"". Racism can show up no matter WHO you are dating - White, Black, Asian, etc. That was one of the things I've had to reconcile. 

Second, in every relationship, you are going to encounter differences. At a basic level, you will encounter differences in personality, tastes, activities, gender (if you're in a hetero relationship), and experiences growing up. When you decide to pursue a relationship outside of your own race or culture, there is an added layer of different racial and cultural experiences. Even if you date within our race, you CAN still encounter a partner who has anti-Black sentiments or racial prejudices towards our own people! 

In closing, you have to decide for yourself what you want in a partner. To be in a committed relationship with a person outside of my race, that is White, I made sure that ANY person that I decided to date was empathetic, listens, and validates my experiences. My husband, who is White, is all of these things. Yes, we have had times where there were microaggressions towards me that went over his head. I pointed them out to them and now he recognizes them and stops it when he sees them. Of course, when there is overt racism he steps in. Subtle is subtle for a reason.

Think about it this way: you're visiting Japan. You go to a restaurant and order ramen. You eat your ramen quietly. Pay for your meal and leave a tip for your waiter. The owner tells you that they are offended by your behavior and ask you to leave immediately. Do you know what happened here? If you've ever visited Japan and/or know about Japanese culture, you'll know that you're not supposed to leave a tip - that's considered an offense. Also, if you don't finish your meal and/or aren't slurping, the chef may think you don't like the food. But of course, you wouldn't know these things cause you never lived in Japan so how could you be aware of them? Do you get what I'm saying? 

If you prefer to date within the Black community that's fine BUT to assume all Black people aren't racist/anti-Black isn't fair. To assume all White people are racist/anti-Black isn't fair either. You could miss out on a good friendship or intimate relationship with someone because you wanna hold onto prejudices and assumptions about them."

Easy for me. I've dated people from all different backgrounds and especially people with predominant European ancestry. I don't date racist people. So when issues of race come up we can have an open dialogue and honest discussion. They teach me and sometimes I teach them. But I also don't carry the belief that entire group of people feel and think the same way. If I did, then I imagine it would be harder to feel safe dating that particular group of people.

"Something that always used to get to me is when talking to a white person about a situation that other black people can easily identify as being racist.  But the white people will say ""Wah"" cry some more about racism that isn't present.  White people from my experience, often like to scoff at, ridicule, or just write off an interaction as not being a big deal.  Meanwhile other black men and women can easily have the same point of view as me without me saying anything.  Making me feel less batshit crazy, in terms of seeing shit that is actually happening.

When I used to date a white woman, I would ask her did she see how someone acted and she would just play it off as I am looking too much into something.  Even though I am bad at articulating myself, I admittedly can feel a certain racist ass vibe coming from a person that she would completely miss.  The only time she would catch on if it the racism was nasty and in your face.

Meanwhile with black women, you don't have to ask, we can just give each other a certain look and know what type of bullshit is up when dealing with a racist lol.  Being around other black people seems to be the only way I can preserve my mental state since it's the only way of not feeling like a nut who is hallucinating shit.  Thankfully this sub exists."

"Married to a white dude here, for the last 12 years. It seriously took him a goddamn decade, two mixed/black kids, a trump presidency, a pandemic, finding out his ""normally sweet"" parents are actually casually racist bc white, a biden presidency, and literally hours upon hours of hearing my black-centric political, history, and news podcasts and audiobooks, for him to one day say to me, ""dude, i always thought you were being oversensitive all these years but holy shit, the world is literally built upon racism"". 

he understands now that i've always been telling the truth, and that he has been programmed to disregard/discredit/discount such claims, bc white solidarity or whatever white people are specifically doing that keeps racist bullshit alive. and he is now committed to protecting me and our children in any way that he possibly can, and refusing to participate in such structures that keep people subjugated.

for the record/full transparency though, when we first got together, we were both casually racist bc i had a LOT of internalized misogynoir at the time. He's from a large, but minimally populated state, where there are truly not any people of color. I grew up raised by a white/racist mom who taught me I'd never be as good as her/anyone because I was black, and i'll always have to work against that. 

But over the years all of that has mostly been stripped away, and now he's married to someone who truly has zero fucks left to give, who will verbally dress down racism from anyone, in any form. So he's had to do some catching up, but he's coming around nicely. it just took almost 15 years of being together, and for him to extrapolate how these ideas and structures will affect our children, before he was able to internalize anything I was saying with any meaningful resonance. He still fucks up, as do we all, but he at least knows WHY he's fucking up now, and is able to correct himself on his own. it's his journey so I respect that, but I can at least point out empirically that it's at least *possible* for white partners to understand your worldview.... eventually."

"Greetings,  


Today I am making an inquiry that I must admit is years late. My older brother is a 27-year-old schizophrenic with bipolar disorder and drug abuse issues. He is incredibly large and hard to manage. He cannot provide for his own basic needs, and he constantly rages and has an outburst that is loud and, at times damaging. My brother graduated high school in 2012. By 2014, he already had run-ins with the law and was using drugs. My parents were slow to recognize the signs until it was too late. He had a terrible episode which resulted in him smashing our home. During this incident, he used a table leg to break every single glass in the house and threw out the house's TVs. It was a complete pubic spectacle, and it caused us to have to move from the neighborhood due to the expenses and my mother's loss of work. I persevered through the constant episodes he had, including physically attacking my parents and sister, and continually damaging property. I am the only person whom he has not attacked because I tried to stay gone for as long as possible. I lived out of state from 2017-2020, and I did not want to return home; however, due to the impact of COVID-19 and being a young female with no financial security, I had to come home. While living out of state, I would visit for holidays, and most times, I would stay out of the house all day or disengage. Since coming home in September 2020 until now, here are the things I have noticed.  


1. At a minor inconvenience or family member telling him something, he can immediately turn violent, loudly yelling. He has physically hurt the family in the past, but now he screams extremely loud and cusses.
2. From time to time, he will come home smelling like weed and goes through the house looking for food and trying to pick fights with people for no reason.
3. He believes a female celebrity is a witch who put a curse on his life. He blames her constantly and even says unnecessary violent things about this celebrity we have never met.
4. He talks to himself LOUDLY ALL-DAY LONG. I am not kidding. From morning until night and he can sometimes have conversations with himself back and forth. It's loud, it can get aggressive, and when people come around, he either doesn't realize until we say something or immediately gets quiet. Most nights I wear headphones and put on white noise to block his talking out.
5. He grooms and uses the bathroom absent-mindedly. We must often clean behind him because he will be talking to himself and leave a pool of water or not correctly hang his sponge or leave the bathroom a mess because of a loud conversation he is having.
6. He cannot properly cook basic things like eggs or make a sandwich. If we leave him home alone without food, we run a high risk of a house fire because he can put something on the fire and let it burn and smell the burn and continue to talk to himself. He doesn't clean or do his own laundry; he can be in the same sheets for months without care.
7. Personal grooming has become a task as he no longer wishes for his hair to be cut, and he rarely showers, but when he does, the water will be all over and the floor mat soaked, and we must hang it outside.

I could go on and on, but the main point is that we need help. Even after all these years, I would say my family is clueless about what to do with this situation, and it has caused me a great deal of personal stress. I still rise and try to accomplish things in my life but dealing with my brother makes things more complicated than they need to be. He has been seen and professionally diagnosed by a doctor, but he refuses his medication and shots. He causes a great deal of drama, so my family doesn't even ask about that because they don't want to deal with his rage.  


I genuinely think from 2014 to now, and it has gotten incredibly worse and impossible to deal with, it has made me want to flee not only my family but the entire state. However, I am no longer going to let this stress eat me alive. Today, my brother talked to himself loudly and yelling in the garage, and my mother told him to come inside. It became WWII as we tried to restrain him and calm him down. He cussed her out, wished death upon her, and yelled until I'm sure the neighbors heard. I need help and resources to deal with this. I don't want this situation to eat us alive.  


In my perfect world, my brother would go to a 24-hour facility where he can be watched and cared for to heal, lose his drug addiction and learn life skills. I do not believe my parents are the best caretakers and the rest of us walk on eggshells around him. Please can you tell me what you know to deal with this? I do not care about the price, and if we cannot afford it, we will at least be knowledgeable about it. He is unwilling to seek help and would be against it we need people who can help.

"It might take court involvement. 

There's nothing really surprising in your story, it sounds like what untreated psychotic disorders can look like (it sounds like he has schizoaffective disorder, which is the name for shizophrenia+bipolar). With medication it might improve. But the reality is many people with psychotic disorders resist or refuse care, and it can be a very long process to make it happen.

You could start by contacting the doctor he saw in the past, or a mental health clinic in your area. They could connect you with resources, maybe. He's a risk for violence and property damage, or drug charges maybe, and if he gets in the legal system he will probably be forced into treatment by court ruling. 

You could also look for family support in your area, or online. Unfortunately I don't know a resource for family of someone with schizophrenia or bipolar, but I know you're not the only family to try to manage a loved one with significant needs like your brother today."

"Hi there - guy with bipolar disorder and in recovery from addiction here. I'm lucky that my symptoms aren't as intense as those you describe but I have some experience with that kind of situation.

Something someone told me in an AA meeting once: ""nothing changes if nothing changes."" Your status quo has ended up with your current circumstances, and unless you change things I'd say it's likely that things will continue as they have.

I think you're right that he needs the kind of professional help a treatment facility provides. There are two major types, inpatient and outpatient. The difference is inpatient the person stays there 24/7, and outpatient tends to be several hours a day but lets the person stay at home, continue working, etc. If y'all have insurance, they can provide you a list of covered facilities in the area. From your description, I suspect a time in an inpatient facility might help, and as he starts to stabilize maybe graduate to an outpatient program.

But here's the thing. Someone who is in that space has to decide to work on issues - for themselves and their own wellbeing. You cannot force him to change, nor are you responsible for his decisions and actions. It can incredibly hard to see someone close to you going through so much and coping so badly with it, but that feeling doesn't make it your responsibility or your fault. At some point, you gotta draw a line and stick to it. Without hard boundaries and consequences, it can be hard to understand for someone who is struggling how not okay their behavior has become.

He has been in more corporate facilities like through hospitalization but nothing residential. Residential is really expensive, and can be like a prison depending on the facility itself. 

He is being placed in a group home now, which I‚Äôve heard can have the same issues as the first kind of place I described but they have therapy, activities, 24 hour monitoring, in home health care for however many hours are needed to assist him in basic care to the extent that he needs it.

"Many times in my youth I encountered people who tried to bring me down with words like that. Now, decades later, I recognize that they really were just jealous and threatened by me because I was different, because I did not conform. But, time has shown me that they were the ones with the problem.

Because, time has proven that my differences, my refusal to conform to their notions of what I should be - that turned out to be my super-power - the very qualities that have led to extraordinary success in life.

That old saying about sticks and stones vs words is something I would repeat to myself when I was hurting from that sting of rejection. Their words were the only tools at their disposal to try to bring me down and keep me at their level. In reality, they were the pathetic ones.

Especially, now that I can look back on it. I far exceeded all those people beyond anything they could have imagined, while those same folks that rejected me for being different remained stuck in whatever life mess they created for themselves. They say a drowning man will try to pull you down with them.

Time will tell. You'll see. When someone feels compelled to attack you so viciously in this way, it usually means they are pretty messed up.

"Turn that sadness and hurt into something positive. Channel it into something constructive and better yourself. I was always the butt of the joke and never invited to anything. I used that as motivation to change my life into something I would be proud of. Those same people are not doing any better than me now, and it is happy to reflect on the days when I wanted to be just like them or hide the hurt they caused to seem relevant.

"Finally got a burst of creative energy again. In the back of my head, I was like, ""Hmm...could this be the onset of mania? That's the last thing I need, after this terrible depressive episode. Especially since I'm about to be leaving this mental health treatment program and going back to work."" 

I got maybe a total of 4-5 hours of sleep last night, snatched in one-hour increments. And other than feeling kinda tired around the eyes, I'm actually pretty okay, and I'm buzzing with new ideas, so...yep. Pretty sure it's mania coming on.

"Hi, 21 yrs old guy, sorry in advanced for this long ass rant

TW: talk of suicide and mentions of police brutality 

My family and i are real close

it‚Äôs just been my mom and my grandmother and it has always been this way (dads a piece of shit who was never in my life)

raised homeschooled, socially awkward, and no friends lol but that has never bothered me in slightest

however when things were getting really hard due to personal reasons i have became suicidal for about two months 

during that period of time, there was a great fear of asking for help

i remember a time when i knew what i was feeling was NOT normal and that i should speak up

i didn‚Äôt want to tell my family because i didn‚Äôt want to worry them 

suicide was never a conversation we thought to have because ‚Äúblack people don‚Äôt do suicide‚Äù we‚Äôre a strong people 

 i was taught to be strong in the face of adversity

i was never taught the machismo of toxic masculinity however the programming was still deep seated in implication

being suicidal felt like I Was a failure in the eyes of my family

i remember being so scared for my life that i held my phone to call the suicide hotline 

however i did a quick google search beforehand about how it works

and one of the reasons why I gave up even calling them was that i read if there was a chance you might harm yourself that they are legally obligated to call the police

 that literally sent a cold shiver down my spine

thoughts were rushing to my brain ‚Äúthat police officer is gonna kill me and it‚Äôs gonna be my fault‚Äù 

That feeling of isolation was paralyzing 

the police was like an enemy i was taught to avoid at all cost

a necessary burden at best, life threatening at worse

i knew it was because of the color of my skin

what if THIS cop was the one that‚Äôs gonna do me in
all because i wanted to ask for help

Even if it was a nice cop, what if this cop was gonna treat me differently, decide i was ‚Äúacting aggressive‚Äù and kill me

i didn‚Äôt want to be a T-shirt

another name to add to the long list of mistreatment by police

i didn‚Äôt want to be another george floyd nor a brianna taylor may they rest in peace

so, i just put the phone down

and let myself suffer

i‚Äôd promise that i would suffer but i won‚Äôt kill myself

it was hard battle and i was losing

the only reason why i‚Äôm not dead is because my mom intervened and asked me what was wrong with me

and‚Ä¶ i couldn‚Äôt say anything

not a word was able to come out besides ‚Äúi‚Äôm fine.‚Äù under heavy and sad eyes

she knows me more than anyone i‚Äôve ever known and all I could say was i‚Äôm fine

we had to go to a more private part of the house to have a one-on-one

and again she asked ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong with you‚Äù

and for the life of me it was like my mouth was wired shut 

not only that but my heart as well

i sat there for what felt like 20-30 minutes before i told her how i was feeling

it was the most cathartic conversation i ever had in my life

we were both crying by the end of it but the long and short was that ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok to ask for help. no it doesn‚Äôt make you weak to ask for help‚Äù

after that conversation i‚Äôm proud to say i‚Äôm no longer suicidal

it felt like a coming to jesus moment

i never realized that i didn‚Äôt know house to ask for help

and to be honest i‚Äôm still learning how as it still feels like a new muscle

im grateful for my family"		post	18.21104169676245	male	White	0.9895427227020264	na	na	na	3	BlackMentalHealth

I hope you guys don‚Äôt mind‚Ä¶I‚Äôd love some other reactions to this part of life‚Ä¶

I don't usually put gender on most things, but I feel, unfortunately or not, that men handle these crises a bit differently than our counterparts. I've witnessed some do insane things that they haven't done in 20 -30 years and it hasn't always worked out for them. 

I am using these gentlemen as cautionary tales...while doing that I also feel the crisis coming on...especially as of late. While I have no desire to wake up in a pile of coke in the champagne room, I do feel at a loss sometimes as to what I want, what I'm doing, where I'm going...and will I love the outcome or resent everything that's brought me there? 

I know people who are doing this (seemingly) effortlessly, and that's who I'm trying to use as motivation. My post yesterday what just a reaction to the overwhelming weight that's been sitting on my chest and shoulders. Trying to resteer things that got off track. Finding some clarity in this fog that's taken over. Reminding myself that one or two stumbles does not define me, while at the same time realizing that multiple stumbles in the same space is a sign that things must change and some things can't nor won't change until somewhat drastic measures are taken. 

So I am taking stock of a lot of things and realizing where I am...physically and mentally...might require a big, drastic measure taken. I don't know where/what that really means right now, but it makes me feel a lot better to know that I do have something that's awaiting me...I just have to find it...and I woke up this morning with  a sigh of ""ok, you got this, you got this!""

If you're feeling the same way, just know, you're not alone...even when you feel at your most alone..."	miasma71	post	25.328085949438208	male	White	0.01050596684217453	na	na	na	1	BlackMentalHealth

Hey I get it too. I'm a black woman that loves me some dragon ball. Definitely agree that seeing Mr. Popo is an uncomfortable experience. I remind myself that it's a show. An old show at that. Definitely a piece of our racist and colourist history. But rather than demonize yourself for enjoying a show, why not use it to start a discussion about the portrayals of dark skinned people in the media. I agree that it's racist but I don't entirely agree with censoring history or just removing pieces of history. It is was acceptable back then but it's not now. Let's talk about why.

I grew up watching DBZ and I never saw anything racist about it. I always saw Mr. Popo as a spiritual entity that served Kami. Understanding the history of his caricature hasn't changed that view for me. He doesn't resemble a real human and I don't remember any racial stereotypes in that show. DBZ is/was influenced by western media. The Buu sage has the main characters named Bibidi, Babidi, and Buu from an old Disney song. I don't think the same cultural context is there in these cases though.	DMAN970NLOCK	reply	na	na	na	0.9985528588294983	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

It‚Äôs a Japanese show from the 80s and 90s. Mr. Popo is Indian. All of the darker skinned characters of that time are based on Indian stereotypes with turbans and snake charmer vibes.

"I'd be curious about why you feel depressed. Not that you should/shouldn't but it might be helpful to get to that next layer. Do you feel like you're not allowed to like anything problematic, and this realization is a loss for you? Are you feeling like there's just not enough stuff out there that doesn't remind you of the worst parts of our history? Are you getting guilty about liking the show? Know that there is no one way you *should* feel or react, and whatever your deeper feelings are, they are valid. Knowing what's at the root of your feelings can help you work through them *if* (and this is the most important part, imo) you don't let them take over and/or you don't take the blame for this show existing. 

I was a kid when Dragon Ball Z came out , so me & my siblings all grew up with it. We loved it, and it was a big part of some of our best memories. Those memories are more important to hold onto (to me) than any kind of relief I could get by boycotting the show. So now it's similar to old pictures of me with puffy braids and gapped teeth. There are parts of it that make me cringe, parts that are adorable, and parts that remind me of how far I've come in life. And that's all okay for me. Some people might look at the show or a company or movie and determine its not worth it to hold on to or that it's doing more actual harm than they are willing to support. That decision is up to you alone.

One last note. You didn't say this, and I'm not assuming this is the case, but I struggled with being the weird Black girl who liked this kind of stuff. That was a big struggle, but now, more than ever, it's becoming more obvious that we are everywhere. If you (or anyone) struggles with feeling like they don't belong or this thing isn't for us, just hop online. Tons of Black animators, anime artists, more and more Black representation in anything you could be interested in and you might find that it's not as new as you'd expect. 

You belong where you want to be, and you deserve to enjoy the things you enjoy. 

TL:DR - while it brings up old racist images, I don't personally think DBZ is at the root of systemic race issues. It's your choice to determine whether it's above or below the line of acceptability for you."	DMAN970NLOCK	reply	na	na	na	0.9985528588294983	no	no	strong	na	BlackMentalHealth

So I‚Äôve been seeing someone for 4 months now, we have not made anything official. I feel like I‚Äôve ruined what could‚Äôve been a good thing.

My dumbass did it again because I‚Äôm an idiot who ruins shit and now she says all her feelings are gone. When I tell her I dislike something, or I am skeptical about something she sometimes goes into how I don‚Äôt like anything she likes, and asks how this is going to work if we have nothing in common. For example, she thinks Kevin Hart is funny I don‚Äôt, then she went into how I just don‚Äôt like anything and that I am a negative person.  I asked my friend for advice on this and she told me that her perception of me is just that I am negative because that‚Äôs all she knows. I just feel awful shes giving me the cold shoulder. Now everything feels awkward conversations, dates‚Ä¶.she says she needs time because what she‚Äôs feeling isn‚Äôt good. I feel like I am going to lose her and I haven‚Äôt even gotten to ask her to be my girlfriend. I‚Äôve broken down twice yesterday and was trying to eat my feelings at work today.

Bro I‚Äôm only speaking as if she does give you another chance. So if she does you have to really listen to what she says and bro she may be speaking surface level it could be so much more when it comes to the negativity. Just take a look in side and call yourself out and take accountability. Actually make the attempt to catch yourself when you see yourself doing these things and always hold yourself accountable. I was a jokester with my girl the way I joked didn‚Äôt make her laugh, so I realized I didn‚Äôt have to stop making jokes entirely just change my jokes for her because I love to see her laugh. Talk to her about these things help her understand but you still have to change just cause she understand doesn‚Äôt mean you get to stop working on making this jokes funny for her.

"Like it‚Äôs difficult for me to post about this even as I know, I know, I know that I know that I know, that I suffer from this. 

Because like even as I‚Äôm sitting here crying in recognition about all of this, it doesn‚Äôt seem real. Like ‚Äòrejection sensitive dysphoria‚Äô doesn‚Äôt seem like a real thing, even as I have been so isolated in my life for decades because of it. 

I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about mental health, and especially Black people in America, and how through the generations there hasn‚Äôt been the attention paid to mental health that it needs. Like issues around mental health are so stigmatized in our community and I think that that is a direct unfortunate legacy of outside dehumanization through enslavement, Jim Crow, etc.

"Nah, depression and anxiety are up around the world. Your predisposition for both having been formed well before you ever had a hand in it... ironically, a small part of it is your ancestor's trauma that's been passed down through your genes that contributes to these things. On top of the fact that we live in the kind of society that exploits people and then gaslights them into thinking problems are individual and not structural/systemic/societal. While you can't have good health without them, the totality of wellness goes beyond food, education and housing.

I feel guilty about resource inequality in a global and local scale though and I do find that a decent amount of my depression and trauma is a direct result of what my ancestors suffered. 

Whether it‚Äôs the pain that comes from what the generation before me and before that one and before that one suffered, it all weighs on me significantly. So does the fact that I‚Äôve seen people die for reasons that are the direct result of racial inequality. That fucks with my head every single day. Dead, because of racial inequality. Dead, because of prejudice in the medical system. Hospitalized because of prejudice on the legal system... I have family alive today who were enslaved in state penitentiaries. I have an elder who tells me of how when he was my age there was a lynching in the news on a weekly basis. I have nightmares about an attempted lynching that never made and never would have made the news, and lose sleep and feel sick from anxiety because of it. 

Yeah I would say my mental state is tied to my ancestors‚Äô and my peoples‚Äô oppression. For sure. But the state of my mental health isn‚Äôt chalked up to that. It‚Äôs just not something that can be extracted from the big picture if the big picture is my mental health. It isn‚Äôt though. The big picture is our health as a people.

My biggest issue is when I have a breakdown. I (officially diagnosed, not self) have bpd. So when I have ups, they‚Äôre high. So are the lows. Two weeks ago was my low. I felt like I was ready to alt+f4 myself, but thought better against it.

I was part of a discord with a bunch of really brilliant and funny people. That ended up crashing spectacularly after this latest incident. I was going to take a break, but I ended up getting into an argument with someone I truly admire. The result ended with me crying and self harming.

After trying and failing to just pick myself up and ignore what I was feeling, my emotions got the better of me and I decided to fully pull away. I apologized to everyone I bothered, especially the person I got into an argument with. He hasn‚Äôt responded to any of my messages, but that is also understandable. I decided to take a break from trying to socialize with people in general, but it hurts my heart so badly to push away from them.

I have severe trust issues. Anytime I feel like I did too much, I recluse and scold myself. I think I realized that with this latest incident and the way our last conversation went that me pulling away was for the best. There have been multiple occasions where they‚Äôve said they cared for me, but I didn‚Äôt really believe it.

I still don‚Äôt.

Now I just feel like I made them all mad and now I‚Äôm back to being alone and scolding myself. I wish that I was able to hold all of it in and take care of things outside of the internet. They were the only social circle I really had. Now that I left and put myself on break, I‚Äôm faced with unending silence and it‚Äôs scary.

Do you think I made the right choice to step back? I feel like if I didn‚Äôt, they would have anyway. I do tend to get exhausting when I‚Äôm upset.

Thank you for reading this big ass wall of text, heh."	Aromatic-Score4734	post	24.544758013868492	female	White	0.015034127049148083	na	na	na	1	BlackMentalHealth
"I too have BPD and I can relate heavily to this. 

When arguments happen between anyone we admire or love (friends, family, groups, mentors, etc.) It can really be upsetting to us. It can feel like rejection or we feel like that person will abandon us so what we do, as folks with BPD, is pull away from them first because we believe that they will run away from us anyway and/or are mad. 

I don't wanna be the one to tell you if you areright or wrong in your situation. I have a strong belief that you yourself know that based on your own values. I can suggest some questions to ask yourself:
1. Why am I pulling myself away?
2. How do I know that the person is mad at me? Did I ask them? Did they tell me they are mad at me?
3. What emotions am I feeling about this? 

Interpersonal relationships are REALLY hard when you have BPD. I know for a FACT. Been dealing with my BPD for years and I went through DBT 3 times yet I still have trouble handling the ups and downs of all of my relationships. I'm whole ass married and I still self harm and try to alt+f4. Just know that it does get easier. 

You have the self awareness so this is why I strongly believe you are on the right track. Ty for reaching out to the sub for help. üíú

"Anybody experienced this singularly by itself?
My major explosive episode ( two months) of it came about through being in an mentally/emotionally abusive interracial relationship, stress and severe sleep deprivation.

This was followed by smaller instances when having flashbacks of the major one the following year ... along with the debilitating depression that comes from healing from it.

It‚Äôs one of those hard to explain when all you‚Äôve had medically diagnosed previously and medicated for was social anxiety. When I sought out professional guidance to try and understand what happened.. i was referred to a student on placement,I wasn‚Äôt taken seriously, advised to not drink coffee ( which I don‚Äôt anyway) and go for daily walks ( not ideal when agoraphobia was in play too) 

The notes to my dr were very patronising and incorrect stating that I was upset about the relationship ending, despite me repeatedly stating that my concerns were my cognitive dissonance and mental breakdown."	sospeace	post	33.72046547286019	female	White	0.07046793401241302	na	na	na	2	BlackMentalHealth

"Hi, i recently got diagnosed with ADHD with the help of my girlfriend of 3 years. I come from a poor background with no support at school and a very conservative environnement. Until the age of 18, i never thought about that type of stuff. I always thought that i was dumber than others and i just needed to work harder. When i went to college, i started questionning myself and my identity. Before i just thought i was an angry guy with no salvation, but now with the help of my family and the doctor i think i can understand little bit better who am i and how to deal with myself.  All my life, i've been discriminated because of the colour of my skin and my accent and i believe that those experiences made me more angry and unaware of what was happening all around me. At times, i would lash out agaisnt my family and my girlfriend while knowing i was in the wrong, but even then, i couldn't stop. With time, i started opening myself more to my partner about how i feel and how i think my brain worked. But then after my dad had an heart-attack, my mother broke her leg and Covid happening, i just fell bad into my old habits. Since then, i've gotten my ADHD diagnosis but i feel like i haven't had a breather in two years. I've showned abusive tendencies toward my loved ones and even more to my girlfriend. I love her very much, she is one of the only bright spot in my life. Before meeting her, i was just another angry kid fighting his way out of the system. I was always alone because i was of lighter skin then all the others in my neighbourhood and i was bullied because of my weight. Even when i went to the gym people used to make fun of me because they thought i was acting like the typical ''lightskin''. Overtime that anger was bottled up and anytime someone tried to pick at me, i would lash out with violence. It was the only way i could communicate without getting insulted and bullied. Anyways, since then i've worked on my anger issues but i just feel like i'm not moving along at the pace i would want to. I wish i could see a professional but i don't want a diagnosis to block me from future work opportunities and frankly i do not think by living with my parents i could even try to seek help. I've seen toxicness all my life from my parents, with their abusive relationships, at schools, with the other students, and in general with my neighbourhood.

PS: Sorry for my bad english, i do not write often in this language

TL;DR : I'm not happy with myself, my anger issues, my life and what i've become."		post	24.84839309091536	male	White	0.9920308589935303	na	na	na	1	BlackMentalHealth
"Just a note - a diagnosis wouldn't have to hold you back from work opportunities, because you don't have to tell them. Your medical information is private, there's no law that says you have to share it (at least in the US). 

I haven't told my job that I have Bipolar Disorder, even though I'm currently on medical leave to get treatment for a serious episode.

"I went through my phone to see the pic I took when I last did my hair. It said 94 days. That was a day shy of a week ago... it‚Äôs been in a ‚Äúprotective style‚Äù for so long it was no longer protective. I did it around the time I decided to get help. 

Before that, I spent about 6 months with a bush that legitimately started freeform dreading. I was not functional, and in such a bad place that I had to get help... I was put in a kind of intensive treatment plan...I‚Äôm almost done. I‚Äôd forgotten what it felt like to not feel terrible *all the fucking time* and I didn‚Äôt even realize I‚Äôd gotten there again. 

I‚Äôve been giving myself hair treatments for days and I‚Äôve trimmed, slowly slowly getting to a point where I‚Äôm ready to do another protective style ü§°

My boyfriend hadn‚Äôt seen my hair in almost a yearü•¥ my head scarf became a part of my body. Those are so hard to keep on while being intimate. You gotta use pins or it‚Äôll come off.

"Have you ever found yourself scheduling sessions for days you know are going to be hard? 

Just for context: I was blindsided with a breakup on vacation the day after having a panic attack during her best friend‚Äôs wedding. 2 years down the drain in less than 12 hours. No issues prior to that. She‚Äôs had many moments of struggle and I always did my best to be supportive of her. I had one bad day and she decided to walk out of my life. I was halfway across the country. No real support. Tried to do the adult thing and deal with it but it started breaking me. That was 7 months ago. In that time I struggled in grad school for architecture. Lost my job. Tanked my health. Thankfully got a therapist before I lost said job. Still managed to pull out a 4.0, top project in my class and got an assistantship. 

I‚Äôve maintained a pretty usual schedule on going every 2-3 weeks. But it‚Äôs these dates that were special to me that seem to be hitting me the hardest.

Mentally depleted, As a black woman I've tried for years to get proper mental help. There are so many hurdles to overcome. For awhile I was seeing a yt counselor who admitted he came from a racist family. Many of my issues stem from being black in America. Even though he was helpful in making me realize some things. I think I made him so uncomfortable that he had refused to continue working with me. Im still searching for some real help. When I found a practice that is managed by mainly POC Thier prices are extremely high. How do they expect POC who are struggling financially to get help. Even if you do have insurance they don't take it. I eventually gave another yt woman counselor a chance but she was very judgemental and I knew she would not understand my point of view.

Hello everyone I‚Äôm a 23M and just looking for advice on how to cope with having a bad mother. I do understand that she tried like everyone else but man my childhood memories show the true reality of it all and that it was the bare minimum. Even pass all that I do still care about her it‚Äôs just hard being the child and having to be the one to mend a broken bond that should never have been broken. I see her as mom and that I am her son that‚Äôs it but I do care but it‚Äôs slowly slipping away. There‚Äôs no genuine communication I have to force everything, I have to text her or call her it‚Äôs never vice versa. She just always shunned me away and was very mean causing me to react to her the same way.  It caused irreversible damage but I tell myself I was only a kid/teenager I do take fault for my actions but I‚Äôm not sure she does. I can go deeper but I just don‚Äôt want to feel sad right now it was hard typing this because all I ever wanted was a caring and supportive mom.	cinobanks21	post	27.82878959751507	male	White	0.9942745566368103	na	na	na	7	BlackMentalHealth

"I had similar issues with my mom who unfortunately passed last year. I understand wanting to make it work and change the relationship. Please know that the only thing you can change is you and your reactions not your mom. Protect yourself and your mental health. Realize that your mom is who she is and probably will never change. Love/accept her as she is and find the love and support you desire from someone else (a mother figure).

"I'm surprised this is met with positive feedback, seeing that saying ""negative"" things about Black Women in general is considered problematic. Thank you for sharing.

I spent most of my childhood in homelessness because of my mother. She's a substance abuser. As long as I refuse to enable her habits, our relationship will stay strained. 

The best you can do is not let her negative actions get the best of you. And be careful sharing this because SOME(gotta cap that for those with comprehension issues) females will use your traumas to gaslight you, seeing that enough of them are convinced that ""women"" are right, even when wrong. 

But yeah, combat the negativity with positivity. There are older women that don't mind being surrogates via providing positive insight. It doesn't make you weak for having older women as maternal figures/womentors. It simply means you're trying to be as balanced as possible."	cinobanks21	reply	na	na	na	0.9942745566368103	weak	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

The hardest thing to do in this situation is practicing empathy. Empathy is something I believe everyone is capable of but it is something worth practicing as well. I am the oldest and I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôve bearer the burden on not only being the oldest but taking on the responsibility as the man in the house on several occasions. Not only that I played the role as the father figure to my siblings. But it‚Äôs empathy that bridge the cap of understanding. They could be a reason why your mother responds to you in such as way that probably has more to do with someone else than it does with you. You may not see it that way but there is something I read that said‚Ä¶ sometime you have to think of family as they are the way they are like an animal and you cannot expect them to be any different. It‚Äôs like not expecting a wild animal to bite. They are the way they are for a reason. For some, it‚Äôs in their DNA and it‚Äôs not in the way you think. There‚Äôs something called epigenetic. It offers a great explanation, if put into context with family bonds. On a side note, how much do you know about your maternal grandfather or great grandfather?	cinobanks21	reply	na	na	na	0.9942745566368103	weak	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
"Your story sounds very similar to mine. I'm the oldest daughter with 2 brothers at least 8 years younger than I am. She would hide the fact that I exist to people she knew but not my brothers. After I became an adult, she would stop communicating with me altogether when she had a man in her life, also hiding the fact that I exist/I'm her daughter. No emotional support. Did bare minimum my whole life.  

I held tons of resentment and bitterness towards my mom when I came of age, as I grew up having lots of  issues (that I'm not going to get into here) and she either couldn't be bothered or she lashed out against me about her problems. Long story short, I never had a healthy or close relationship with my mom, even after I made efforts to work on one. At this point we don't have one at all.

I had since learned how to make peace of it. I take the saying ""it is what it is"" to heart. Things are not what we think they are supposed to be. They are what they are. My mom has issues of her own. What happened in the past is what happened. She is how she is. I realized that I can't control any of these things. I learned how to forgive her for my own peace. I still love her. I still wish I could have a relationship with her. But I've since accepted that it may never happen. It also helps that I've had mother figures throughout my life"	cinobanks21	reply	na	na	na	0.9942745566368103	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
"I‚Äôm a soft black girl, almost 20, and have a lot of stuffed animals in my room, and I sleep with a lot of them in my bed lol. I especially love Sanrio toys. I still have my Littlest Pet Shop bunny from when I was 4-5, and sleep with her now. Stuffed animals bring me comfort and joy, and they are one of the things that help me relieve from stress, anxiety, etc. I suffer from social anxiety, OCD, possibly CPTSD, and other anxiety disorders. Since I was a little girl, I loved stuffed animals and they always brought a smile to my face. They‚Äôve always been like little babies to me. Unlike other girls I grew up around, I enjoyed them more than dolls. I even liked them more than real people, and would protect them from anyone who tried to tear them up.

"I‚Äôm 29 and I play with this stuffed unicorn all the time and my boyfriend stays telling me to stop, when he sees me petting it lmao. 

Idk why he flips out when I do that but it‚Äôs such a cute unicorn... maybe he‚Äôs jealous and wants to get petted too. 

Frfr though I don‚Äôt have a stuffed animal thing. I keep my tampons in it (it zips) and generally only think to pet it to bother him. But if I did I would expect my partner to get over it. 

I‚Äôm kind of bawdy (I‚Äôd also be described as soft, no doubt, but still bawdy) so when my partner has some shit to say that‚Äôs not a big deal like ‚Äúyou have got to get rid of those hammer pants‚Äù I just be like, ‚Äú... but you want the box tho‚Äù and however he replies I just say, ‚Äúbut you want...the box.‚Äù

And then I just be like, ‚Äúthis is how I come!‚Äù Not in a sexual sense just like that‚Äôs how the meal comes. With a side of fries. With a side of hammer pants when I feel like wearing my hammer pants. Some times I tell him to get into it. And do a little hip rollin. Might be weird to apply that exact tactic (the last bit) to stuffed animals (well I think it would be because I‚Äôm not into that but some ppl are and I don‚Äôt care).

The truth is that guys don‚Äôt really care about stuff like that very often and when they say they do, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily matter.

im sure bpd heightens premenstrual symptoms but also do I completely have another disorder? I guess I need to start keeping better track of my symptoms, but thats a lot of work.

Recently I've noticed my moods would change about a week before my menstrual cycle would start. I've also been suicidal before. What has helped me is being more aware of the present and practicing grace. Meditation helps to bring you more aware of your feelings to sort them out. Be grateful for even the smallest things that bring you seconds of pleasure and make you feel special.  Ultimately no matter how you feel You are Special and have so much to offer.

"I'm sorry you're feeling that way.

If it helps, I was recently diagnosed with PMDD. It was fairly straightforward getting the diagnosis, though I was already in therapy. In therapy, I had a daily mood tracker app on my phone. It'd send me a notification and I could press 1 button to sum up my mood. There was also a space for notes if I wanted to write more, but it was optional. Then I'd talk more in detail during therapy. It took a few months to notice, but I realized I was severely irritable right before my period. (The app was also free)

Some quick research explained that PMDD is typically treat with birth control and/or SSRIs. So I saw a gynecologist, because I wanted birth control for reasons more than just the PMDD. My gyno did seem concerned when I said I had some suicidal thoughts, but I emphasized I was dealing with that part in therapy and that my therapist said it was at a manageable level. If you are considering birth control as a treatment, it might be easier to get a birth control consultation and prescription than therapy or antidepressants. Birth control alone won't help the BPD and PTSD though. In the US, birth control pills are covered by insurance.

"I don‚Äôt understand BPD and have some prejudice against the diagnosis (not people with the diagnosis... legit just the diagnosis) because of the way it‚Äôs assigned to women primarily. I just don‚Äôt trust it, especially when it comes to cross-cultural diagnoses, when that‚Äôs the case. I don‚Äôt trust people‚Äôs assessments to be culturally competent across cultures, they need to demonstrate that and  it will never be assumed to be the case... not by me. But I also have such limited experience with it (I only know one person who‚Äôs been given that diagnosis [and told me about it]) so I know nothing and have no business having much of an opinion on the matter. 


I have PTSD and MDD and strongly suspect I have PMDD but it‚Äôs hard to get evaluated for that. I stop being suicidal on like day 3 of my period and start at peak ovulation though so in my mind, it‚Äôs not a matter of if I have it, it‚Äôs a matter of if I‚Äôm diagnosed, and considering the treatment for it... it makes no difference to me because they treat it like a form of depression and I‚Äôm already being treated for MDD."	cherryqueen2	reply	na	na	na	0.9980959296226501	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
"Is anyone else deeply upset about Black issues just meshing with every other culture and us still not getting ours? I love this new trend of learning how to dance and such. There is a possibility to sweep things under the rug. It's the new crack... Everyone is affected. I feel like the next generation does not care that the world is deeply against them, but those values of their peers are still altered by non black people. We are literally dancing with the devil.  It blows my mind that we have a lot of Asian and white  people trying to come to the cookout : learning Afro beats  and dancing like black/African people, curling their hair to look like it's kinky, hood wear, mannerisms of black women and men, and not bring anything sincere. And then we still get followed in the stores or lose our children to freaked out cashiers. I get the influence of Asian movies and kung fu, for black people. A whole 60s to now trend. This shifted to anime and manga.  Thats something we appreciate and love to participate in as people, not black people. No problem. Cosplay and all. But some characters are literally made to make fun of us. We still get instantly accused and threatened by Asians at their stores and they go ape shit on conversations they can't understand. Given some black people are just rude, the sellers motive is racism. Our motive is to  hurry up and buy buy buy.My significant other is white latino ( not just white passing ) and love to rep being Latino but disregards their white side for not really having a culture and other clear reasons. I try to entertain them with cultural foods and topics, but there's a lack of desire for it. I bought a few plantains to make mangu con salami. A week later, I went to go make it but they threw away the plantains because they were black and ugly. I was floored but laughed it off. Then I said could that be me if they wanted üòÇ  ( I guess anyone can be a plantain at the right time ) 
Being a Afro Latino (Plantanoes and collard greens child) ... This was triggering. Being black in certain places is triggering because ""every body want to be a nigga , but nobody wanna be a nigga"" . Its like they literally take us on and off and stow our skin in a closet. I got dapped up by a white female at a gay bar... Why , like why?  I'm just tired of not being recognized and then it's over compensated for. I feel like black people need to make it clear and separate themselves from all other races to address Black issues. And, be proactive on setting boundaries until equity is established. That means access to ancient Black secrets. Black lives matter wasn't enough or to me even a real thing. It set us up, but no follow through. And no the NAACP ISNT JUST FOR BLACKS.  I think it starts by just not letting white people or others taste our culture until we get a full on reperations from the world. It isn't our own fault , being black is literally the newest race on the planet. Just under 300 years old, we are finding our way through tar. We don't get as much shit from the corner store Arabs."

It's also more difficult for 'us' the ones that have love for outside of our race. We get hate from all around us including from our own community like we don't love our own.

"*warning long post*

I feel like this is the place to share what‚Äôs going on in my head and find advice. Imma start by saying I‚Äôm 22 and the oldest son of 7 kids‚Ä¶I‚Äôm also gay and disabled, but not disabled to the point where I‚Äôm completely dependent on others. So like I feel like my parents don‚Äôt respect me and just don‚Äôt really care how they make me feel. Like they‚Äôre a bit controlling, their way or the highway basically. They‚Äôre always leaving me to watch their kids even tho I‚Äôve told them that I don‚Äôt like doing it and how watching the kids(who don‚Äôt listen to me) stresses me out to the point where I have panic/anxiety attacks where I can‚Äôt breathe and can‚Äôt control my tears. It‚Äôs just a bunch there. Also I feel like they don‚Äôt respect me because when I came out and told them that I was gay like 2 years ago they told me that I wasn‚Äôt old enough to ‚Äúmake that decision‚Äù and didn‚Äôt know what I like but my high school freshman aged brother gets their approval cause he got a girlfriend. I even told them how at church the older ladies that be forcing me to hug them, or touching me or my hair(I don‚Äôt like to be touched unless I approve of it) and some of the comments they say make me uncomfortable and they just laugh and make jokes. And lastly, since I‚Äôm disabled I get a disability check, but it‚Äôs not a livable amount to do anything, it‚Äôs legit less than $1000 a month, like I already pay my car note and some other stuff and most of it is gone now, how am I supposed to afford rent, utilities, groceries, or anything else, so I wanna work to get more money. I got a whole college degree going to waste and college debt now. But they would rather me depend on the check and other government sources. I found out that I can work and still get the other benefits like Medicaid still, but they don‚Äôt listen. Anytime I mention working, my feelings, or anything that they don‚Äôt agree with or don‚Äôt care for I get yelled at, tuned out, talked over, laughed at, or I‚Äôm missing whatever point they have. It‚Äôs all stressful and messing with my mental health and well-being, it either makes me so pissed off to the point I‚Äôm literally hot to the touch and shaking or mad depressed, panic/anxiety attacks, can‚Äôt breathe, and uncontrollably crying. Like how do I communicate if they won‚Äôt listen. Ultimately I wanna move out and focus on myself more and just love them from a distance."

I just want you to know - there's nothing wrong with being gay - and it's okay to have your boundaries about wacthing after you're siblings. I know you must love them and stuff, but looking after seven younger kids - there's no way you can focus on what you need to do with that.

"Does anyone have any tips on how to soothe emotional pain?

I've been doing the following:
- Consistent diet and exercise (weight training.. gained 10 lbs and a lot of strength just to prove I'm not half assing)
- Therapy (almost a year)
- meds (been on probably at least 4 months)
- Watching animal vids on youtube
- avoiding things that trigger negative thought patterns (literally everything, from movies to games, porn, news, anything that involves people interacting)
- going to coffee shops every day just to get out the crib and practice small talk

I don't have anyone else to reach out to aside from my sister and maybe my massage therapist, but my sister has her own issues to deal with and I don't want to break the work/life barrier for my massage therapist as I think it's extremely important to maintain that.

People really don't realize just how much pain some people really be in, especially since they were a kid. Everybody talks about exercise therapy and meds but sometimes people are so broken that it doesn't help long term.

It's like crawling through shit and mud fasted with your legs broken, while people guilt trip you into persisting while they're cruising along in their bentleys with all their friends and family laughing and smiling and shit.

I don't really know what else to do. I'm good at conversations and shit but I've been so socially regressed all my life that try as I might I only connect on a superficial level to people. I don't have much positive memories or connections to share either it's all niche cause I've been alone my entire life. 

And then molesters, perverts and other dickheads are attracted to this trifling little nigga cause he's been conditioned to stay quiet so the world don't see him as a threat. I honestly don't see the point of suffering so much for what?

You are Black. You are authentically Black no matter where you are from and how you grew up. Just because you may not listen to Rap doesn't mean you are not Black. Just because you don't speak AAVE doesn't mean you aren't Black. 

I have friends who are Mexican or Latinx and they aren't fluent in/can't speak Spanish - that doesn't make them less Mexican or Latinx. 

People use the insult of ""Oreo"" or ""whitewash"" to cover up the fact that Black people are NOT a monolith.

"What‚Äôs sad to me reading this is that you‚Äôre stereotyping Black women in general along with yourself. 

Not everybody likes Beyonc√©. I mean I don‚Äôt dislike her or anything and I recognize her voice but I still know more Destiny‚Äôs Child songs than solo Beyonc√© songs. Being Black doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre guaranteed to like whatever Beyonc√© song is put on. 

I was in a black students/POC student group in college too and was always the odd one out but no still had black girlfriends outside of the group and within the group, got along with the girls even though we didn‚Äôt vibe the way they vibed with each other. 

No one treated me disgracefully or called me any kind of Oreo. 

>> - I didn't try to get along with the other black girls, like I should have 

Please don‚Äôt take this the wrong way but this is a very basic social thing. Not a Black thing. You should try to get along with a group if you‚Äôre going to be a part of it. 

>> I don't speak aave

You kind of have to have a grasp on standard American English to be in a university out here and English dialects in the US are close enough to have limited issues communicating so this shouldn‚Äôt be an issue. Not everyone‚Äôs native dialect is AAVE. The sheer number of El Salvadorans I know who do not speak a lick of Spanish or the sheer number of indigenous South Americans who only speak Spanish or Spanish and English.... Chile lol

>> - Only black rapper I like like that is little simz

But what does that actually have to do with being Black? Being Black is about your ancestry. Literally nothing to do with what *entertainers* you‚Äôre a fan of, and I just want to point out how messed up it is to reduce your or anyone elseMs cultural identity to something like that, especially within the context of our history in this country it becomes an even wilder association to be making.

Ok? Lol. I don‚Äôt pay attention to celebrities, period. And I dare anyone to sit in my face and talk some shit about how I‚Äôm not the kind of Black they accept as authentic. They could kiss my natural... okay?

"I honestly dont know what to say. 

I've spent my last four years at a pwi, going through a preparatory program alone and in that time frame I've developed a deeply profound resentment (I'm afraid say even hatred) of white people, or anyone who looks white for that matter (that goes for passing/light skin poc as well).

The way I see them live there lives, care free like nothing can stop them - it makes me upset because it's made so that I feel so restricted at my school and in my behavior and speech. I've had different incidents where the staff there had been aggressive towards me/failed to help me, and there were no repercussions for them - because they are white.To be honest some in my opinion, some were even enjoying it - to see my spirit broken and to see me sad.

I hate that people I'd rather not give a shit about have so much say in quality of my life. I've seen these people up close and in person and have had to interact with them on a daily basis - there's nothing extraordinary, interesting or gifted about white people in particular for them to recieve the things they do - the kids in my class just swindle the homework answers out of others and never turn work in on time - SO WHY ARE THEY BEING THROWN ALL THESE OPPORTUNITIES, AND FREE PASSES THAT THEY CLEARLY DON'T DESERVE? WHY ARE THEY ALLOWED TO LIVE THE LIVES OF FRAUDS WHILE MY FAMILY WORKS LIKE A FUCKING DOG TO BE TREATED WITH THE BASIC RESPECT?

I feel like all the white people who say that ""minorities never work for anything"", and minorities ""always play the victim"" - are really just projecting about themselves. They have so much support and help from people at the drop of a hat  (take a look at ukraine, I wish other african nations had that same support) and the minute something bad happens to them or they don't get what they feel there entitled to - they take advantage of that to the fullest, with there selfish, self-centered and egotistical greed.

At this point, my classmates and teachers just make me feel so upset on a daily basis - even there ""unintentional"" racism is just to much to deal with. I've tried switching schools to an hbcu but I'm forced to stay to be used as their stereotypical pwi token black kid. And none of them actually care about my wellbeing.

I'm conflicted with how I'm supposed to see myself with these thoughts. On one hand I'm expected to interact and sympathize with these people on a daily basis in order to do networking, and improve my social standing - but on the other hand I don't even want to be in the same room with these people let alone talk to them - because nothing good ever comes from being around them, and they just make me upset. 

I want to feel like my feelings are valid, but even among the other black kids at my school. They all have shitty white friends - the obnoxious kind with no personality, who speak in there white version of aave and use the n-word. They are truly horrible people, but it's like the black kids who hang out with them give them an excuse to say that shit and be that way our in the open and it drives me insane sometimes with the amount of disrespect and childishness they display with no consequences.

I can't tell if im justified in seeing myself just trying to cope living their shitty world, or if in reality i'm just the ""racist villain"" in their story. Either way these feelings over the last four years now feel like a cemented part of my identity. I know they're holding me back from moving up in society because they keep me from interacting/wanting being friends with the white kids at my school - but at the same time I just really can't let it go. I really do not like these people at all and don't want anything to do with them.

I think..... I truly hate white people now, and I'm just done with this is shit being a constant unecessary battle. What do you think? And How should I deal with this?"	Glad-Can-8290	post	25.68187705264181	male	White	0.9973505735397339	na	na	na	7	BlackMentalHealth
Your feelings are valid. Unless you plan on a career in academia, this is a temporary situation. You finish your program and you leave. Not every Black person is good at recognizing racism and some people ignore it as a coping mechanism. It's too bad that you don't have peers to commiserate with, that's how it is. It sounds like you need some tools for stress management to get through this. Journaling, exercise, meditation and there are lots of supplements in vitamin stores.

I just wanted to say,  I see you, I hear you and I'm in the same place though I'm a little older so the resentment/ frustration comes from just going through my daily life... Their behavior won't improve in fact it gets worst because the as holes in your classes will become the ass holes that make the decisions at your job and for this country... I haven't found a full proof way to deal with it myself but these comments are spot on... I would add that finding self aware and critical thinking black folks like yourself will definitely reduce the intensity of your feelings because you'll at least be able to express yourself authentically around people who understand where you're coming from... reducing my exposure to white people, media and culture as a whole and making the conscious decision to seek out black people, media and culture has definitely helped a lot	Glad-Can-8290	reply	na	na	na	0.9973505735397339	weak	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
"I want to second what u/Onyx239 said. I see you. I'm quite a bit older than you (Gen-X) but I've been through essentially the same thing. Most of my teens and adulthood spent in predominantly white spaces, whether school, work, or community. I have often felt like that lone token black person - in HS I was one of the few in my honors program, in college one of the few in my dorm, at work often one of the few or only black professional/manager, in my town only homeowner, marina the only boat owner, country club the only member, vacation the only resort guest, etc. the list goes on.

This is something you need to live with, at least for awhile. Later in life you can make more choices for yourself. I agree with others that you need some stress/anger management tools because this is not going to get a lot better. I find my rage is just as intense now as it was when I was your age - and I'm a very successful, fortunate black man, so I can only imagine what others must feel.

One thing that keeps me grounded is my friendships with both blacks and whites - through whites I see that life, though often better than it is for most blacks is not always simple or easy. Yes, they have advantages, but no it's not always a charmed life. Perhaps you are dealing with an upper class group of people, and that is as much about wealth and socio-economics as it is about race. You might not feel too much differently around a group of rich black snobs. Just saying keep this in mind. Through my black friends, well it goes without saying, I see myself in the mirror, I have my experiences validated, they understand the pain, the rage, the frustration, all of it. Not every black person is going to be supportive though - you have to find  your peeps and choose carefully.

Bottom-line, I think you know and expressed that your feelings about whites are going to hold you back. There really is no avoiding dealing with whites unless you're going to become a hermit. The further you advance yourself in terms of career, work, stature, the more you become one of the few - that's facts I'm sure nobody wants to hear, but its facts, not changing quickly enough.

You're been hurt, you're hurting, and I'm asking you to be open and vulnerable and get to know some of them. I know THAT is a tall order. But, in knowing it will bring better understanding and they become humans too, not just white faces. Which makes it harder to hate them. This is a big juggling act for sure - because you will continue to be hurt, no doubt about it, but you will need these relationships. It's a bit like reconciling a relationship with a toxic abusive parent - learning to care and interact yet protecting yourself from serious harm.

Lastly, you need some help with this. I know you painted a somewhat hopeless situation, but I don't think you've looked hard enough or thought this through enough. You're reacting. Understandable. But, many of us have gone through what you're going through. Surely, there are people in your life, and resources available to assist you. Look for them."

"Your feelings are valid. I went to a PWI a good 20 years ago almost. I felt all that you do. 

Now I‚Äôm going to tell you to let it go. It doesn‚Äôt matter and doesn‚Äôt serve you. Now that you can see the truth of things move accordingly. 

What does moving accordingly look like? In my life I understand all skin folks ain‚Äôt kin folks. Pwi is where I met Black people who never met another Black person. Those who grew up in White areas, who were adopted, who were biracial and only familiar with White culture. Having grown up in Black American culture I was a minority amongst minorities. I don‚Äôt expect them or their culture and issue tone deaf white besties to understand, empathize, or care about me and my Blackness. 

I know what it is in the workforce, it‚Äôs exactly like life at a PWI. 

I don‚Äôt get sucked into their causes and concerns. I‚Äôm not marching for feminism with Karen when she doesn‚Äôt even see me as a human, let alone a woman. 
White men are safer than White women for Black women anyway. 

I understand that race and class intersects to make the types of people who send their kids to pwi and enable them to act like trash. The few White people I grew up with were culturally Black, and did not act the same way even though they were afforded the same privilege. 
There are plenty who don‚Äôt.

Go live your life, don‚Äôt let them make you salty in your youth. Go do whatever you want to do, but be aware. It‚Äôs kind of like living in the city. You must be street smart and alert, but you don‚Äôt let the gritty things that happen in the city stop you from living your best life."

And, my psychologist is basically screwing with me at this point. Like, I went in for an Autism and ADHD diagnosis. And, she basically dismisses me and my concerns (especially seeing as how I‚Äôve already looked into what those thing entail). Then, says she‚Äôs leading to ADHD and c/PTSD, before going with just the latter. And, says how I didn‚Äôt complain about things (I guess, enough, because I definitely did).

You have no right to cut yourself. Why ? Because you're already hurting and you don't deserve that. That clean streak is for a reason. 
Sucks that you haven't had support during your accident and then feel as if you still have to complete task that sound as if they were already difficult to complete.
People are insensitive and we tend to over think as well. 
Everything about this sounds temporary. You're assumed diagnosis isnt your problem. It's your doctor's job. Give that to them and if you don't like it seek another if you can. When possible, contact your primary care and see if they have services for patient advocates. And if the accident was not your fault, lawyer up...

"There‚Äôs something I want to get off my chest. I‚Äôve been reminiscing a lot lately about my childhood and things I did back then. I just stumbled upon memories of something I did when I was 5 or 6. Whenever someone yelled at me or made me upset, I would get angry and sometimes hold a knife in my hands. I would look angry at them and threaten them as I hold the knife. Yes, at 5-6 years old I did this. When I was little, when people got angry at me, I felt like they were treating me like a criminal or an evil person. That‚Äôs why I overreacted in such a way. 

I would also draw pictures of killing people who made me angry or people I didn‚Äôt like, including family. My aunts found my violent drawings and they were shocked, worried, or concerned. Idk how my mom felt about it, but she probably spanked me for it. This is something I don‚Äôt want to remember, but I did held a knife at my mom once, but she punched me a lot in front of my cousin and my aunt (her mom). They just watched without saying a word. After that, I cried in my bed in my room. Idk why I did that, but I guess I was angry at her about something she said or did to me. My mom used to hit me a lot when I was younger. Mostly with belts or hangers, and sometimes with her fists. 

I‚Äôm almost 20, and I feel a lot of guilt about these things I did as a child. I often regret a lot my mistakes and I just don‚Äôt know to let go of it.

I regret having anger outbursts in class and making people think I‚Äôm psycho or unlikable.

She won't like it, but then her saying the things she does is all manipulation tactics. I hope you can assume day five your way out of that household. In the mean time, remember that it takes respect to earn respect, but she unfortunately hasn't shown you that. She hasn't shown you the care and kindness that would make you feel less resentful of her and more trusting of her. Get the rest you need.		reply	na	na	na	0.9945865869522095	weak	no	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
Hello how are you? I hope all is well. I have been in therapy for close to two years. I'm currently on my third therapist. She is a sweet, and wonderful therapist. I've been with her for over a year now. Lately I've been struggling to open up to her on certain issues. It's not her, it's me. Sometimes in our sessions I don't feel like talking or I hold back. Then a few days later all of my feelings bomb rushes of things I should have spoken with her about.  I'm thinking about changing therapist but I don't feel like starting over. I've been staying with her because of familiarity and I kinda look at her as a friend. Can you guys give me any tips on how to open up to my current therapist? Or, how to tell her I need to find somebody else.	ProtectionMurky3946	post	28.687642238462953	female	White	0.0033224497456103563	na	na	na	1	BlackMentalHealth
"I have this problem too. I think a big part of it is just trust. For me, even with people I'm friendly with, I really struggle to open up.

What's worked somewhat is jotting down quick notes on what I'm thinking about right in the moment. Not a ton of detail, just a very small summary of the thoughts. That way, when I meet with my therapist I can read from the notes instead of speaking from my mind. I find it's easier for me to read than talk cause it feels more objective and detached in a sense.

Then judging from the reaction, I may feel comfortable enough to speak more candidly. I'm still extremely guarded, but much less so than 9 months ago. This is my first therapist and I haven't been in therapy long, but hopefully some of this might be helpful for you"	ProtectionMurky3946	reply	na	na	na	0.0033224497456103563	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"After seeing a honest and courageous post by a young sista I was more motivated to post. See I‚Äôve come to embrace my ‚ÄúLayers‚Äù but it was not overnight, complete, or by chance. See I‚Äôm black man in the U.S. and I‚Äôm kind and caring but not punk or a pushover. I did grow wanting to appease ppl and not be bullied. Raised in da hood I grew up very stereotypical, come from a Military family (Army Brat) and didn‚Äôt always see or believe there was a way out. After many years of trauma I decided to be triumphant. I started mental health therapy 8 years ago and took seriously after a couple years and many failures/life lessons from every aspect of life. Once I did the universe connected me to some bomb ass therapist and I learned, accepted, and overcame certain struggles. Such as being eclectic, a bit mesenteric, geeky, empathetic, an ambivert, lover, fighter, being molested on multiple occasions as a child, frontal lobe dyslexia, bouts of depression ADD, PTSD, and am HSP. 

So I share with all of us who are survivors and striving to turn tragedies in to triumph. Or just want to learn more so you can have a better understanding and softer heart.

"Hi guys! I was just wondering if there are other people here who are highly sensitive or HSP? I‚Äôm one and it‚Äôs more difficult when you‚Äôre black and grew up in places like ‚Äúthe hood‚Äù. I‚Äôm 19, almost 20, and I grew up half my childhood on the south side of Chicago. I‚Äôm also an INFP. As a shy and super sensitive black girl, I was often targeted by other kids and I was bullied and made fun of A LOT. I never really made friends, and people thought of me as ‚Äúweird‚Äù or ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù. I also had anger issues.  I always loved drawing, painting, animals, nature, picking flowers, and just doing girly things. I‚Äôm an artist btw. A lot of adults considered me a ‚Äúsweetheart‚Äù. 

I was always quiet at school, which made me an easy target. I would cry whenever someone yelled at me or just told me to do a simple instruction. Yes, I was that sensitive. My legs and arms would always start shaking when someone scared me or made me upset. Other kids would usually laugh at me if they saw me crying. I also daydreamed a lot in class. 

My mom and dad wasn‚Äôt very supportive either. They both grew up as those ‚Äútough kids‚Äù in the projects. Instead of comforting me when I was crying or hurt myself, they would yell ‚Äúshut up!‚Äù or threaten to hit me. My mom was always the one hitting me with belts, hangers, etc. whenever I got in trouble or made a mistake. Sometimes I wish I had parents who were more caring and sensitive to me, and that people understood me more. 

I just wanted to share a little background story and growing up as a black HSP girl. I hope the story wasn‚Äôt too long. Thanks for reading :)"		post	18.077884752114464	female	White	0.0024803762789815664	na	na	na	8	BlackMentalHealth
"Yep highly sensitive Black woman here. Our experiences growing up are almost identical. I‚Äôve always been very sensitive and cried a lot as a kid. Especially if an adult raised their voice at me. I wasn‚Äôt a difficult or ‚Äúhard headed‚Äù child so people just seemed harsh and I didn‚Äôt understand why they couldn‚Äôt use a normal voice to ask/tell me to do something. My dad‚Äôs a loser so I was primarily with my mom and she was the school bully growing up so having her as a mother has always been a challenge. I think my mother being given a highly sensitive child that‚Äôs probably similar to the kids she bullied is some sort of karma. She failed the opportunity to correct her behavior though and would corner me and yell in my face that I was weak and to stop crying. On top of that I was bullied by kids and teachers at school. As a sensitive child it was clear how unkind and unreasonably selfish people are. I learned as a kid people aren‚Äôt safe to be around and I developed anger problems, depression, and social anxiety.

As a mid 20s adult that‚Äôs learned to mask as a less sensitive person I‚Äôm trying to rewire myself and be more emotionally honest despite other people. I‚Äôm not someone that sobs and makes my emotions other peoples problem recklessly/selfishly. However I am learning to embrace that I‚Äôm the type of person that could cry at the sight of a sunset, or two butterflies flying along side each other. I cry at EVERY animated Disney movie and have avoided watching Bambi cuz I know it‚Äôll mess me up lol they always have that one emotional moment in every movieüò≠US culture favors the brutal, cold, and selfish and certainly doesn‚Äôt hold space for BW to be vulnerable they want us to work or die but we‚Äôre here anyway‚ú® I choose to rebel by being my true self and I want to start traveling out of the US where I might find more genuine, kind people and a slower pace.

"I dunno how much value I put into the title or term HSP. Though I admittedly follow the subreddit because I find the perspective helpful for myself.

Everything that I see attributed to HSP as traits within myself I can also attribute to being traumatized or just not having the skills or support to cope with unusual circumstances. Sure some folks find a way to power through in ways that appear on in the surface as less sensitive, but I think it just shows up different for everyone.

All that being said, I relate to not facing conflict well. To having it impact me in more visible and ""weak"" ways. I'm creative and love nature, connecting with others on a deeper level. Being gentle and sweet. Constantly in my head dreaming of anything and everything, whole storylines and performances. It doesn't take much for folks to make me nervous.

So while I don't relate to the title itself, I relate to your experience a lot. You're definitely not alone."		reply	na	na	na	0.0024803762789815664	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"I'm an HSP and ISFJ. I grew up in Toronto, which was tough enough but my heart goes out to you. We don't really have severe bullying in our schools. Most of my issues came from growing up with my Narc mom.  I'd take long walks in the greenery around our house and take lots of pictures of flowers and trees. I needed to in order to clear the cloudy negativity from my soul. My mom hated my walks because she knew it was how I got away from her.

I also love water a lot. Niagra Falls is my favourite place. I can't deal with sudden loud noises without screaming. Horror or gore are absolutely out of the question.

"First off all, whatever you feel, to whatever extent you feel it, is all valid.  If you feel despair, there's a reason. And that reason might not even make complete sense to you just yet and that's ok.  You might also be able to pinpoint the reasons behind your feelings but you're not ready to act on them or change ... and that's fine too.

May I remind you (as if you didn't know) ""the past year"" has been part of a two year + worldwide pandemic and on top of that, you're Black, which is a glorious VIP club most of us would never opt out of, but also A LOT  to manage at times.  You've continued staying alive through all of this.  You've tried reaching out to friends and are self-aware enough to know that friendship is not social work, so you pull back. It may seem insignificant but you get points for trying, you tried meds because you thought it might help.  You tried getting off them because you thought that might help. Meds change your chemistry so the 'miserable' you're feeling now is understandable (good on you for being connected to doctors to come off meds safely ... everyone's chemistry is unique so the side effects vary from person to person).

The part that really stung me was the way you minimized your emotional state.  If someone loses their leg and another person loses their arm, the person without the leg doesn't ""win"".  Both people are dealing with loss and both are significant to that person. What you're going through is the only struggle you need to be concerned with.

"Idk if I would call this abuse or trauma, but when I was little girl, my dad and some of my uncles and male cousins used to physically harass me for fun and touch me when I didn‚Äôt want to be touched. Idk if they were just trying to play fight/roughhouse with me (a little girl) or do that because I was shy. I was very shy and reserved as kid, especially to adult men. I was shy around strangers period. I was also shy around loud or lively people.  

Every time my uncles or male cousins came to visit us or if we came to visit them, I would always get nervous and hide somewhere or hide behind someone. I hated it whenever they tried to ‚Äúplay fight‚Äù with me. My mom and other people thought it was funny that I was shy around them. I would hide from my dad too, but I used to see him every day. I stopped seeing him all the time when we moved away, and the only time he comes to visit is when he has to repair something in the basement or in the garage. I‚Äôm definitely shy around him now, and I hide in my room every time he comes over. He still likes to roughhouse and physically harass people for fun. I remember I was younger, he used to try to roughhouse with me outside, and other people would see and laugh at us, which was embarrassing and I hated being seen that way. He didn‚Äôt spank me like my mom did, but the only time he did ‚Äúpunish‚Äù me with a belt, was when he heard about my ‚Äúbad behavior‚Äù in 2nd grade and he threatened to break my arms. I‚Äôll never forgive him for that. 

Now, I‚Äôm almost 20, and I don‚Äôt see my family members often anymore.

"Im sure all of what you mention was draining growing up and thank you for sharing. As a man this is a fear that I have when it comes to me wanting to be a father. I don't want my child to feel small or intimidated by me or the world. Im sorry that you haven't been treated as a little girl or accepted with patience. And it definitely sounds like you never had a good relationship with men, let alone have the temperament to handle new ones. I have always been afraid of my father and I didn't know why. And always felt weak when it came to being around other boys , my brother, cousins and uncles. I'm 28 and still feel this way today. I couldn't cry or yell or defend myself without being popped in the mouth by my mother or pressed by my father. But they usually explained why I may or may not have been out of terms. I think when you get to a place being able to actually defending yourself against men, you'll feel comfortable expressing your thoughts to your father and demand respect from other men. I do think that men and women are very different and should be handled as such- equals, with given courtesies to the opposite.

"I was abused by some male family members but it wasn‚Äôt roughhousing... it was sexual abuse. I never really had an issue with my uncles or male cousins roughhousing with me because once I got boobs I wasn‚Äôt allowed to play like that anymore. I didn‚Äôt get to do football anymore with my cousins because I was ‚Äújust a girl‚Äù and ‚Äúdeveloping‚Äù and it was ‚Äútime for me to follow the call of the moon [insert howling sounds lmfao üò≠]‚Äù

As for my uncles they didn‚Äôt rly play with me in ways I didn‚Äôt want to play with the exception of a great uncle who I‚Äôm pretty sure molested me, a father who sexually abused me and an older cousin who was definitely molesty (I have occasional flashbacks of it in the color palette of that great-uncle‚Äôs country house... he‚Äôs dead now, but it‚Äôs a bummer I didn‚Äôt get to meet the nice ones because that was apparently a big generation of really cool uncles and all I have is a thousand precious stories. My dad is dead to me (I called myself an orphan when my mom passed away- he didn‚Äôt raise me, he was granted custody because he‚Äôs a war vet and he proceeded to just let my grandma take care of me until night time when he‚Äôd abuse me and then leave me with her again in the morning every other weekend until he disappeared on a bender that landed him in rebab and by then so many years had passed that nobody was paying attention to custody papers... my mom was like how ‚Äòbout no and he was like I‚Äôm too busy with heroin to go to court. La di da. As for my cousin, he‚Äôs basically exiled from the fam and we live in this small county where the locals are a small group and he be lyin to folx about how he never had no family like nooooo you got chased out because you was touchin your little cousins... people legit think he is one of the transplants who came here fleeing Katrina but I tell people no that‚Äôs my cousin he‚Äôs just a pedophile and nobody in the family fucks with him and that‚Äôs why he ain‚Äôt got peoples).

The rest of my uncles and male cousins (I have a HUGE family, and I‚Äôd say I talk to 4 of my uncles daily, and several of my male cousins mostly daily and that doesn‚Äôt include all the others I talk to regularly just less frequently) were always dependable, safe places and they even hunted a guy who tried to force me in his car when I was 19. They came through rollin deep and I had no idea my family was even like that. They were like yeah go head and call the police, and when they leave, we‚Äôll handle it. And they did. 

I definitely don‚Äôt have any trauma from roughhousing or from legitimately playing with my male relatives. I‚Äôve always been kind of soft.. the women in my life would encourage me to not be, and to toughen up while the men in my life would applaud my little-girl courage and laugh when, halfway through my tough guy act (especially if I was being Jackie Chan lmfao) I got scared of the monster or my imagined opponent or the TV and ran away. I did become tougher but I‚Äôll be honest a lot of the women in my family passed away whereas I was largely surrounded by and raised by these women into my early adulthood so I‚Äôm now in a certain familial role (like, I‚Äôm the remedy-maker and I‚Äôm still in my 20s, that type shit). I ask their advice on pretty much everything, they laugh at me as I ask a lot of stupid questions (one of my uncles be like, ‚Äúthe only stupid questions are the ones you don‚Äôt ask... and the ones YOU as ME‚Äù lmmfao. They let me play with their stuff (they have lots of instruments and will humor me when I wanna rock out, they‚Äôre much better musicians than I am) and they still look out for me like they did when I was a little girl."		reply	na	na	na	0.9978674650192261	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
"Wow, I could have written most of this, except my dad never came through to fix anything. Growing up reserved, I also felt uncomfortable with the touching, kissing, overzealous squeezes, and physical touch from male cousins. I wasn't close with them, and the older boys did things that were not okay and have left scars and wariness about men. 

I remember my grandmother called me the r-word when I was like 4 or 5 because I would hide behind and with my dad to escape all of that when we would visit his family. I've never felt safe or honored for who I am there, just a prop to tease and poke and talk at. It was exhausting, and I separated myself from that side for years to avoid the trauma and disappointment.

"There's always someone whose going to be like ""just change your perspective"",  or ""evaluate yourself"" but honestly this isn't the case.

*Even when I'm right about something- people don't take myside.

*Even when I'm wrong about something, and own up to that without hesitation - people don't take myside.

*Even in silence when I don't even say or do anything - people don't take my side.

It's like a no win situation everywhere you go - at first I was in denial, and really thought that maybe if I worked hard enough or stuck to being caring and kind to others - that they would finally be fair to me.

But I'm slowly moving out of that denial stage into acceptance, and I need advice on how I should cope with this.

In every situation it's like I'm expected to be the ""bigger person"", but I'm not any ""bigger"" than anyone else - even if that's what they'd like to believe. I'm just a person - we're all just people."	Glad-Can-8290	post	19.670753010965832	female	White	0.9986281394958496	na	na	na	4	BlackMentalHealth

"I‚Äôm 19, almost 20, and I feel like I lost the love I used to have for my parents and my sisters a long time ago, because of how they treated me. My mom verbally abuses me a lot, even when I do my best to win her approval. Not even washing the dishes or babysitting my niece is good enough to her. She used to hit me with belts, hangers, etc. when I was younger. A week ago, she hit me in the head a few times for insulting her in the family group chat. I live with her, but I can‚Äôt move out because I don‚Äôt have a job and idk who‚Äôll take me in. Idk if anyone in my family or in general even cares that much about me. 
I feel like she‚Äôs the reason why to most of my issues, but she refuses to believe it.  She also doesn‚Äôt believe I have OCD or depression. I‚Äôm the youngest, and my sisters don‚Äôt appreciate me much and I feel like they use me sometimes. Two of them moved out, but before that they never took me places with them or when I cooked something for them, they would reject it or not show much gratitude. My oldest sister doesn‚Äôt talk to me at all, and she never helps with cleaning or washing the dishes. It‚Äôs kinda like a ‚ÄúCinderella‚Äù relationship with my sisters. 

I used to have a lot of love for my family when I was little, but as a grew older, I started to see that the love my parents were giving me wasn‚Äôt real love. They both don‚Äôt take time to understand me, they‚Äôre both stubborn asl and think they‚Äôre right all the time, they‚Äôre both ignorant about many things, and they both believe that hitting kids solves problems. 

I feel alone right now and that nobody cares how I‚Äôm feeling. I‚Äôm kind feel frustrated that I can‚Äôt get help since I stopped talking to my last therapist. I‚Äôve been going to therapy since I was 7 or 9, but I still feel like the pain and hurt is still with me."		post	31.959004079340552	female	White	0.9984558820724487	na	na	na	1	BlackMentalHealth
"Girl, I understand more than you possibly know. You know I always thought that parents were supposed to be there for their kids - that they were supposed to give them the unconditional love the world wasn't guaranteed to show them.

My mom was like that too - to the point where I had to move out at 16 (18 now) and go live with my aunt. To this day I still love her - but I also carry the hurt of feeling that I wasn't good enough to ""deserve"" that love from her. And it hits hard some nights.

I always try my best to be sympathetic to her situation -  because she did sacrifice a lot for me as a parent who had once been that hurt child herself.

I'm sorry op - you deserve love even if you don't feel so - no one deserves to be treated like that."		reply	na	na	na	0.9984558820724487	weak	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"Sometimes people are just kinky like that! There are definitely people who fantasize about the reverse scenario, as well. There's nothing necessarily wrong with it - as long as you only engage in that kind of stuff with fully informed and consenting people (discuss/negotiate limits and scope ahead of time, and have things like safe words in place). Unless your friends have consented, you can't play with them, but many places have an underground kink scene where you can meet people who are into it. Maybe check out /r/bdsmcommunity to hear from a range of people who deal with that kind of desire/impulse?

Just don't ever forget - women are people, their thoughts, emotions, and opinions are exactly as valid as your own.

"Anger has become a problem for me as well to the point where it's hard to block out intrusive thoughts that I'd normally bat away (suicidal, homicidal, etc.). Bottling up emotions doesn't seem to work for me anymore and I've blown more than a few fuses almost randomly at people I love and care about.

Do you know why you get angry or what mood you're in? I usually get angry when I'm interrupted in the middle of a coping skill after a breakdown or a rough day. 

Do you know what your symptoms are? When I'm angry, I tend to snap at others and shut them out, bring up their insecurities or attack them if they start to vent about something irrelevant. I tend to get quiet quick, huff more, and rush around with whatever I'm supposed to be doing.

I've been trying to manage this anger more by realizing it before I come in contact with anyone to do damage. Some surface level things include listening to trap metal (people angrier than me venting in music put me in a listening mode), watching cat videos to elicit sympathy, staying off the news, watching TV with someone I love (or sharing memes with coworker), etc. In the workplace when I get angry I isolate for a minute to do an undone chore on the other side of the building. 

If the anger becomes very hard to control, that's when I stop what I'm doing and walk away before I do any damage. It's better walking away and seeming weird or in a rush than to blow up and deal collateral damage or even lose your job and financial stability.

Sometimes, realizing that anger is a reaction to a fear is the most insightful thing you can do in that moment. When I feel like my mental wellbeing is being brushed away, I can feel threatened, afraid that no one will let me recover from a tough spot, and I will lash out like a scared cat. Realizing this fear helps me to regulate and care for myself until the moment passes.

Hope this helps out. Anger management is almost as tough as breaking an addiction (I have both essentially so I know), and realizing that your anger has become a problem is already a monumental step!"	ason_don	reply	na	na	na	0.9963790774345398	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"I don't have many friends, but I ended up being the odd one out of the only college class I have with them today. Met with a therapist I've been meeting for about a year for the last time today because I am getting too old for youth services and completed a transition. Went onto a poc discord channel for the first time in months and saw that a yt person was using that channel to interview poc about ""recognizing race with bad vision"" or smthn, and I realized almost nobody in that tiny toxic channel is actually black, just mostly other races who aren't happy with ""black people being the only race represented in poc"". One of two of my closest friends is a guy and my parents have taught me unconsciously that it is awkward, so I am ashamed, and my other closest friend has drifted away from me because she feels like she's ""been a bad influence"" (she hasn't).

The only things that made me more introverted are my insecurities. I need people to talk to but I guess I have too many boyish hobbies to relate to girls my age and am too weird to fit into my own race. I talk genuinely to friends about once a month and the rest is spent being in isolation or being an odd one out.

Something in your post spoke to me. I‚Äôm kind of a Reddit weirdo, may be an addict. It‚Äôs hands-down my favorite social media even though I hate it and even though I have to dodge racist trolls.

I have a lot of interests I consider weird, and not even necessarily full blown hobbies. But like I like to look at architecture. I like retro futurism and cyberpunk stuff. I love baseball. I‚Äôm not really a huge gamer or comic book person so sometimes I‚Äôm kind of a blerd but sometimes not. I‚Äôm about to jump into the world of house plants. I love Reddit because it lets me at least see the stuff I‚Äôm interested in doing (I have a lot of social anxiety and some other mental health stuff on board) and maybe chat with the people doing those things

I grew up with a lot of unaddressed internalized racism that I‚Äôm still working through in middle-age. I‚Äôve always felt weird in so many different aspects of my life. I‚Äôm sorry it sounds like you feel that way too and I‚Äôm sorry because it is really isolating, which is why I wanted to reach out.

"This reminds me of myself somewhat. I'm kind of a high-functioning ADHD, thrill-seeking, obsessive type, easily bored, in need of a constant stream of new stimulation.

My solution was to find a career that rewarded this kind of personality. In my career, I'm constantly juggling shifting priorities, constantly under pressure, everything is urgent urgent urgent, everything is super high stakes, always one big error away from unemployment or one good trade/deal away from a giant windfall. You get the picture. Alternating periods of intense concentration and adrenaline for short periods of time with a revolving door of new stuff to work on has kept my mind alert and stimulated.

As a result I haven't really needed too much by way of interesting or stimulating outside activities until recent downshifting and change in priorities. So, not exactly the answer to your question, just suggesting that career can fulfill some of those voids for someone easily bored. You just need to figure out what kind of work suits you best.

One thing that comes to mind is sales, if you are good with people and a good communicator and tenacious. That's where I started and found it rewarding both psych-wise as well as income-wise. It's ""eat what you kill"" so you are testing yourself and your abilities constantly. There are many types of sales roles - I'm not really talking retail or anything, I'm talking like selling big equipment or services or software to commercial customers, stuff like that.

"This journey with trying to find balance after that screw-up with my meds has been too hard, for too long, and now it's gotten just completely unmanageable. I can barely be around my family. I can't function at work. I can't tolerate normal levels of light or sound without becoming violently angry. I have terrible nightmares every night, and wind up getting up way before my scheduled alarm because I just can't fucking take it anymore, and then I get exhausted and crash halfway through the day. If I stop and think about how I feel for more than a few seconds, even just to acknowledge that I'm hungry or thirsty or have to pee, my heart starts racing and my hands start shaking and I start fighting back tears. My quality of life is like, zero. I spend most of my time alone, in a dark room, piping ambient noise in through my earbuds, just trying to hold it together. 

I had my weekly therapy appointment yesterday, and my therapist was like, ""Okay, you're beyond the point of non-professional care being effective. It's not fair to have to ride this out on your own. And weekly check-ins aren't going to be enough. And you need to be somewhere where they can make immediate med adjustments if needed, not wait and suffer for a week until your next psych appointment."" And she gave me contact information for some places to call. Told me to talk to HR at work about short-term disability or FMLA, just to get the ball rolling early.  

So that's what I'm going to do. I had called out sick yesterday, and they know I've not been feeling well since the week before Christmas. But I've been performing, and delivering, and showing up despite that, so I'm not worried about losing my job or anything. And I had scheduled to be out of the office all next week anyway, ages ago. So that's lucky. 

I'm just not entirely sure what to say to HR. Or what to arrange for the period I'll be gone. I'm an Executive Director of a statewide initiative within a larger nonprofit organization, and there are a lot of moving parts. I have a part-time admin/project manager and a large-ish board of directors and a lot of committees, but no real staff. We get operational support from our parent organization. We just did a big event, so there's a temporary lull before the committee meetings and stuff start back up next month (also lucky). I'm just having trouble organizing my information because I feel like I have a brain injury at this point. :/

A Love Letter to My Inner Child

To the little girl who was too afraid to wear a dress,
Because the scars on her legs left her self-conscious.

To the pre-teen who wore long sleeve shirts year-round,
Ashamed the eczema on her arms would generate more ridicule.

To the teenager who hid behind her books and academic accomplishments,
Because the Cool Kids said she wasn't ""pretty enough"". 

To the young woman who felt uncomfortable in her own skin,
Because it didn't fit an imaginary standard.

I want you to know that it is safe to come out now.

I have slayed the demons that kept you 
captive behind bars of insecurities, shame, and guilt.

I tended to the wounds covered in dirty bandages,
and dressed them in love, grace, and freedom.

I set boundaries for the people who violated your trust,
and for those who implanted ideas that limited your self-belief. 

It is safe now. 

It is safe to show up as freely,
As colorful,
As whimsical,
As your soul desires. 

So go after all of those dreams,
you once thought were impossible.

Because my love, 
IT IS SAFE NOW"	DesireeFaye	post	33.77655695618972	female	White	0.001413938240148127	na	na	na	1	BlackMentalHealth

"(TW, also even with mentions of suicide in this post, I'm not suicidal rn so I'm okay,,)

I guess I just wanted to talk a bit about myself and I wanted to see if it would make me feel better... (ill try to keep it brief as possible).

I'm (F18, 140lbs), have been struggling with body image  issues and suicidal thoughts for the past 2 years. I've seen 5 different therapists, to help me cope with that  but before I turned 18 didn't really trust them because they would relay what I said to my mom.

Right now, I live with my aunt - I've been living with her since my sophomore year of highschool (senior), because my mom is an emotionally and financially unstable person at the moment - to the point where she's had 3 diferrent occupations, cars, and divorce trials in the last 3 years, as well as us spending my entire 6th grade in a homeless shelter - line in the sand was when she told me to hang myself with a belt when I was ten, beat me up and then ran at me with a knife.

After that I did everything in my power to get away from her (cps, going to young adult transitional housing programs underage, trying to move with distance relatives), and in the meantime she would break my stuff (lavalamps, computers, etc) until I ended up staying the second time I tried asking my aunt.

She didn't used to be like that - but I think a 20-year abusive and toxic relationship (that she's still engaging with to this day) really mess her up. Both her and her spouses have faced some type of parental abuse as well so I think that's why it effects them as deeply as it does.

Right now she's in an abusive love triangle between her husband and her ex-boyfriend, and every three months or so she'll come to me crying about how she'll leave both of them and never speak to them again and how I can now finally come home because she misses me.

But I know, I'm not going home.

Covid - it was a rough year for me personally - I went from being an honor roll student taking AP classes, to failing all of my courses in my junior year because I simply couldn't function at the level of depression I had for the last 5 weeks of the second semester. I gave up on college and school and my teachers/counselors weren't very supportive either (my counselor told my mom about the abuse I confided in her about - and that didn't go well)

I felt  and still feel lost and broken to were sometimes I sill just randomly burst out into tears with no warning - my mood swings are sporadic and it was then I gotten to the level of anxiety and suicidal tendincies I have (on and off) now.

As for my family it's complicated but I'll just put it in bullets

>- my soul brother is estranged from the family as far as possible and is living content with his girlfriend and daughter that I haven't seen 

>- my older half-sister has 5 kids and is battling with drugs and alcoholism. She doesn't get love from my mom so she desperately looks for it in the multiple men she brings home. She has aspirations to be a nail technician, but she doesn't even have the time or mental fortitude even go to rehab right now.

>- and lastly my older cousin (who is my legally adopted sister) is also estranged from the family with two children of her own. She trying but also struggles with drugs and her mental health, but partly because my mom used to beat her with a broomstick and let her ex boyfriend of 20 years molest her /didn't do anything about it. Now I'm afraid she's caring that abuse over to her autistic son 

So as you can see - my family is broken. They're hurt and have been hurt. I told my self that I would stay to at least protect my niece and the kids, but I couldn't even do that.

Now as a senior who hasn't applied to college, struggling with attendance/ maintaining relationships. I thought about doing the airforce (with pressure from my mom) to try to help the family.

But these crippling expectations, the anxiety and the sheer emptiness I feel on the inside just feels like it's becoming to much for me. I don't feel like a living breathing person, as if I'm a Spector watching a stranger's life unraveling.

Every time eat I get hysterical about the idea of the pounds packing on as if it's the last thing I can hold onto for dear life. One month or day I'm feeling fine and will exercise or walk for eight miles straight. Other days like today I'll skip school because I can't bare to meet the judgmental eyes, and callous smirkss of my classmates starring at the angry and primitive looking black girl with the perpetual scowl on her face.

I feel sick right now and honestly I just binged a bunch of food that I desperately want to throw up, and take from my stomach. But maybe if I post this ill have the courage not to."	Glad-Can-8290	post	29.327317436238424	female	White	0.9981326460838318	na	na	na	1	BlackMentalHealth

Stupid sensitive about this right now, so please keep that in mind. I work with dogs at one of my jobs. I‚Äôm told I do that well, and outside of that mess I made or that one yard (like divided spaces for different sized dogs/need dogs), I‚Äôm told I continue to do well.No one is allowed their phones while being with the dogs. No one is allowed to draw (even in the condensation on the plexiglass). My favorite yard is the lower energy, elderly, medical yard. Thing about that yard, is that people tend to have trouble not falling asleep or getting bored (and whatever that may lead to) in it. I keep myself occupied (when not interacting directly to the dogs) by reading allowed (which is allowed) some of my own books, occasionally singing, and drawing. I‚Äôm told drawing is a safety issue. And, not drawing or writing is non-negotiable. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being unreasonable, but music and drawing are like my go tos. She suggest maybe a stim toy, but none (that I can think of) replaces that need/stimulation/joy. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm overreacting, but I don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm never doing a good enough job to be left to some of my own devices‚Ä¶	1BubbleGum_Princess	post	31.148173393819906	female	White	0.004609073046594858	na	na	na	2	BlackMentalHealth
"If you're able to, it sounds like you might be better served working somewhere that lets you use your downtime as you please. There's nothing inherently wrong with you - we just live and work in a society that tries to ""force squares into round holes"". We live in a society with large puritanical influences - it's a culture that demands the appearance of hard work without any sort of interrogation into what that actually means. If you have the freedom, I'd maybe try to find employment somewhere that allows you your freedom when you're done working.

You're not overreacting - it's an odd requirement. I'm lucky with having the ability to choose at this stage in my career, but I couldn't possibly work somewhere that wanted to police my downtime. I can understand wanting you to focus around the dogs, but what you do outside of that shouldn't be an issue.

"I'm sorry man, its undoubtedly hard going through that right now - I know a couple of people in my circle who've been at it for years. I may not always have the words, but I will say this - it's okay to let yourself breath for a minute - you can make mistakes. You can be a work in progress and a great person at the same time. 

Take sometime for yourself if you can to think things over - like..


- Fundamentally to what extent do you trust and comfort each other in n this relationship?
- How is this situation your in with your wife making you unhappy?
- what is her perspective on this, and what she wants/need, is this a reasonable thing she can expect from you at the moment?
- what is it going to take, to make you happier and more comfortable regarding the relationship? And what can you do to make that clear to others.

To be clear answering these questions won't fix your situation by itself, but in a way it can help you feel more grounded to yourself and your emotions, instead of drifting like it seems your doing now.

In this place we often stigmatize men for trying to get a grasp over their emotions - but it's not  a bad thing. Wanting to find better ways to express and convey yourself to others shows true character and growth. It's that's communication that's the foundation for most healthily relationships.

Make sure to take care of your health op, both mentally and physically, it can do so much good for you.

"It‚Äôs kinda like I always had bad luck with people in general. Whether if it was making friends, being admired, or getting a smile or positive feedback from a stranger, it usually fails. People either say negative things to/about me or just ignore me like I‚Äôm a ghost. My sisters always had it easy when it comes to making friends and being admired or getting positivity from people. Idk if it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre lighter skinned than me, or they just have a more pleasant attitude with other people. I have a pleasant attitude with other people too, but I have anger issues and I‚Äôm very self-conscious. I always struggled to make friends growing up, because I was shy, quiet, and awkward. When people see me, I feel like they already know about my past, my mistakes, my personality, etc. and they just avoid me or make fun of me. It‚Äôs like people can sense I have a bad aura or I‚Äôm a bad person. I know I have anger issues and made many mistakes, but I‚Äôm really a sweet and kind person. 

On my 12th birthday, we went to a restaurant and there was a little boy sitting another booth behind us. He stood back and smiled at my sisters, but when he looked at me, he gave me a frown and sat back down. I love animals, but some people‚Äôs pets didn‚Äôt like me either. In school, whenever I walked in a classroom full of people I didn‚Äôt know, they would laugh, snicker, or say mean things when they saw me. My cousin, who‚Äôs a year younger than me, used to sit next to me during lunch in high school, and she‚Äôs sweet and cheerful, but she doesn‚Äôt have anger issues like I do. Unlike me, many people love her, she has a lot of friends, and she played sports. Many of her friends were the same people who made fun of me or pretended I didn‚Äôt exist. 

I‚Äôm 19 now, almost 20, and I know I shouldn‚Äôt be worried about these things, but the past still bothers me, and it‚Äôs hard to get over it. I often wonder why people don‚Äôt like me as much as they like my sisters or cousin. 

I hope I‚Äôm not overreacting."		post	26.279267075986475	male	White	0.9984909296035767	na	na	na	2	BlackMentalHealth
"Darling, your not overreacting at all. It's normal reaction that we darker skin black women get unfortunately. I used to know a friend who likes pets, like you do and her dream of one day of becoming a zookeeper -  it's a job that requires a lot of patience, care and understanding, which I'm sure you're more than gifted in.

It can be hard as a black woman sometimes not to internalize the external criticism that we get on daily basis - trust me, I know. The furrowed eyebrows, the scrunched-up noses and the unwavering scowl's your way - it's normal for any person to break down under this type of stress we face,  and sadly we are often not given the support that we desperately need.

That's why it's so important for you to be your own best friend in this situation and not be so hard on yourself. What people do to you is a reflection of themselves-  not your character. You are not a bad person just because these people refuse to see beyond the surface into what type of person you are, or into what you've gone through.

Yes your cousins may be good at getting the positive out of people on a surface level,  but ultimately your experience and hardship is going to make you better at understanding people a fundamental level. And in my eyes at least that's way better."		reply	na	na	na	0.9984909296035767	weak	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
It's impossible for us to know how to address your question on the other side of the keyboard.  Have you tried asking your sisters or cousin or a parent or a close friend?

"In general, I feel people are right in hating me and judging me because of other things, but race is a big one.

If a black person does something that confirms the stereotype or beliefs that other people have about us, then it's like they're right or justified in not liking us. I know the people who behave like that don't represent all of us, but it's something we are all judged by and reflects poorly on me.

I know I don't control other people's behavior and I shouldn't care what people think, but it's hard. It's a mental burden I carry around. I actually had to stop checking the news, even entertainment news, because at some point I knew there would be something that triggered me, and make me think, ""yep, yep, they're right"" and I'd feel so much shame and guilt.

It's all basically confirmation bias, even I am ignoring or discounting the ones who don't act like that, but it's because no one sees them anyway. They focus on the stereotype, the negative.

And I'm not just talking about white people. Other races and yes, even other black people. Black men and women do it to each other and foreigner vs American black people (I had to leave Twitter because of that).

I try to tell myself that even the stereotypical, ratchet, or criminal black person has a right to exist, just like the unpleasant people of other groups, and there is a reason they are like that, but it doesn't help as much as I'd like."		post	15.541442363718076	female	White	0.9965090155601501	na	na	na	3	BlackMentalHealth
"But, ask yourself what white people should think of themselves if they followed the same criteria for themselves as you are applying to black people.

We've all had that embarrassed for the race, cringeworthy gut punch when we see another black individual or group do something publicly that is stereotype-confirming. Or even worse, when we screw up ourselves and say or do something stupid and embarrassing. 

In those moments, I remind myself, well if white people applied the same logic to themselves, they'd all have to hide under a rock. We just survived 4 years of the most embarrassing spectacle of white political insanity and ignorance (following the most scandal-free 8 years ever in history when the black guy was in the seat), and yet half the white population feels no shame, voted for the would be orange dictator again, louder and prouder than ever.

Maybe you don't hang around enough white people to see how f'd up they can be too. Don't hold ""us"" and yourself to some unreasonable standard that whites themselves could never meet either."		reply	na	na	na	0.9965090155601501	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
I understand how you feel you're not alone in this. The society we live in is built on white supremacy and that includes the media.

"Got on a new antidepressant that pulled me out of a dark and dangerous place, but it seems to have possibly sent me into dark hypomania, which in my case is characterized by RAGE. That endless, restless, climbing-the-walls energy is all fight energy, and EVERYTHING feels like an attack. I'm talking about, ""The light is slightly too bright in this room, and it's giving me the same emotional reaction as someone punching me in the head and then laughing about it."" Every stimulus feels emotionally painful and dangerous and frightening, and I can't dull the edge.

And I have a toddler who can't sit still or be quiet, because of course he can't, because that's not developmentally appropriate. So I have to keep retreating to other spaces away from him and leaving my husband to deal with his needs, because I'm teetering on the edge of screaming at them both for just *being*. And that's not fair. 

My husband has been left completely alone, for the most part, for almost two months now while I try to get re-balanced after a screw-up with my meds. Except he's not just completely alone with our son, he also had to help take care of me, too. And I really had hopes that it was going to be over and I was going to be back to an even balance.

Growing up on the south side of Chicago, I was always the shy, quiet, and sensitive girl who was often targeted and bullied just for being different. I was also the type of kid who cried a lot, even when someone told me what to do. I loved drawing/painting, animals, nature, soft/girly things, etc., and most kids who lived around me weren‚Äôt interested in that kind of stuff. I never really had friends, neither at school nor in the neighborhood. I never really met anyone my dark skin color, who was similar to me in character/personality or loved the same things I did. I went to predominantly black schools, and most kids thought of me as ‚Äúweird‚Äù or ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù, and just avoided me because I was different. People would make fun of me for crying or just showing my emotions in general. I would also get excluded out of groups sometimes. I had anger issues and had outbursts in class whenever I felt like people were bothering me. 

My mom was never really emotionally supportive toward me or my sisters, and she would often physically and emotionally abuse us. As the youngest, I would get whooped a lot, even for the pettiest things. She never took the time to understand my feelings or why I got so angry at school. She just hit me with belts, hangers, etc. She‚Äôs so quick to judge and every time we tell her about our feelings, she acts like it‚Äôs nothing serious or that we‚Äôre being dramatic. She doesn‚Äôt believe I have OCD or depression. I can‚Äôt even come out to her about my feelings or sexuality, because she‚Äôs so judgmental and hot-headed. I don‚Äôt even feel comfortable playing my favorite songs/music around my family members, because they‚Äôre quick to judge and they‚Äôll just think I‚Äôm ‚Äúbeing white‚Äù.

I hope this post isn‚Äôt too long and I hope I‚Äôm not boring anyone. I never felt like I was a part of black community after all that I‚Äôve when through. I wish to be accepted and loved somewhere, and I hope y‚Äôall understand üíú."		post	14.563933460062614	female	White	0.9979021549224854	na	na	na	2	BlackMentalHealth
"Hey hun, many of us here have a story similar to yours. We have all felt ostracized within the Black community due to our mental health issues, likes, dislikes, hobbies, etc. I've been called OREO many a time growing up. I also grew up in a religious household where, like your mama, my parents were quick to whoop me or judge me or tell me that I was being ""dramatic"".

I‚Äôve never felt that the black community was my community, nor do I identify with any other groups of people. The world sees me as black though so I still get to live a black experience, it‚Äôs just a different one than that of my racial peers‚Ä¶ Not better. Not worse. Just different. Sure I didn‚Äôt grow up fearing for my life, but I was house poor around a bunch of racist white people, so that my siblings and I could get a better education.. Anytime I talk to a group of black folks now, I get looked at like I‚Äôm damaged, stupid, or both. Anytime I‚Äôve tried. Only exception is family.

Honestly the two things that helped me the most were moving out of the Midwest, and accepting the fact that I‚Äôm just not ever going to relate to most black people. And that‚Äôs ok."		reply	na	na	na	0.9979021549224854	no	strong	no	na	BlackMentalHealth
Today was the one of the few days I‚Äôve felt the kind of overwhelmed I did at my other job. I was crying, which wasn‚Äôt bad by itself, but also thinking that and saying aloud I‚Äôm gonna hurt someone. Like, the next B that says her sarcastic comment due to frustration with the current state of things, is gonna get a walkie thrown at her before I get her. And, of course employing this tactic where I say out loud the things I might do (ex: punching someone in the throat). But, I also do things I should‚Äôve done. I asked to be assigned elsewhere; I had a civil, pre-planned discussion with one b; and, I did a pretty decent job at my other assignment (and didn‚Äôt go home to cut myself‚Ä¶ yet). I‚Äôm trying, I‚Äôm exercising, I‚Äôm doing breathing techniques, eating good, practicing patience and understanding with myself (and others), and doing therapy!

"I know the title sounds  strange  but as a Black man I know the Lord may be doing great service 

As a Black Man I want to personally  ask for forgiveness for having deep seed of hatred  towards Black women jn my teen years, my chase for white women came from my insecurity  and racial infeoity  I felt among white kids in my school. I falsely said hurtful things  about black women I am ashamed  of due to ignorance and self  hate as young naive child. As I went to college  things  started to change when I got to he exposed  to more Black women and realized that I only really didn't like Black women  because I would be teased in high school by white friends. Now let it be clear I still bear the responsibility  of my self hatred, and I as man now look and know that I can't play complete  victim of my wrong doings.

But what I really want to apologize  to is my ex(Who was Black) I know we don't  have contact anymore  but I personally hope not only she get saved, but realize  I take huge responsibility  for being dishonest in the relationship.  I walked path of pride in the relationship  and got spat our by God in humbleness towards the break up. I was not leading in many ways but was lusting in my own satisfying desire.


Now the reason I wrote this whole thing is because  I know black relationships are shown to be mess in the media, but I came here to at least show that there can both reconciliation and forgiveness in all fronts. I am here to possibly purify  someone's  heart today o Lord Jesus, ik someone  needs to here this let them be healed  today  as you healed me today.

"I had a similar battle with internalized racism at a young age. I never downed black women and girls, but the attraction to their beauty was not there. 

I didn't feel comfortable being a black boy because I knew how undesirable our skin color, facial features, and hair texture were made out to be by the rhetoric of white supremacy in America. It severely dwindled any self esteem I had as kid. 

I am still battling this hurtful rhetoric to this day. It is why I tend to stay away from black women as relationship partners. They don't deserve a man that looks like them but doesn't appreciate black beauty.

You are mentally strong for being able to speak about this us (anonymous or not). Tons of American black men have experienced internalized racism but the fear of emasculation and the ""strong black man"" trope prevents us from confronting the spoiled mess inside of us.

Soon, I will start a platform that helps black men confront these issues and to promote the inner healing of black men (all men but especially straight, cisgender black men because that is where I feel the most focus is needed)."

I'm also sorry that your therapist can no longer see you. Do you have insurance? If so, call the number on the back of the card and let them know you're looking for a mental health specialist/therapist. They'll be more than happy to give you a few phone numbers.

"Greetings,

I hope that you are all well. It‚Äôs very challenging to confront these types of issues, especially in brown communities and the way that religion impacts on family, friends, and others who might otherwise be tapped as a support system‚Ä¶ Many people receive the advice to ‚Äúpray upon it‚Äù and that often doesn‚Äôt lead to the answers that folks are seeking.

You mentioned that someone attempted to draw a parallel between ethnicity and self-harming behavior. My personal experience has been a little different, but the solution that I developed for myself is often seen as a ‚Äúwhite thing,‚Äù even though I don‚Äôt know anyone Caucasian or otherwise, with a similar approach‚Ä¶

For me, I often find my answers and serve people within The Human-Canine Bond. Many, many people have pets, some have service animals - the behavioral work and the relationship development that I‚Äôm typically involved with is not only productive, but allows me to help others that WE can easily be successful with dogs and that yes, you can have a dog or dogs and that your skill and management of your dogs behavior and your comportment IS a completely valid, socially-acceptable and pride-worthy way to display your ego within the community.

"I tried to put this in the bpd subreddit but ig they aren't gonna let it post there? I just wanted a place to put this...

Essentially, as someone w/borderline personality disorder, I'm bad w/relationships. I also get easily attached to someone and then its hard for me to let go.

"I'd really like a little closure so maybe the internet can help me. I've been doing a lot of thinking and trying to trace my habits and feelings back. I think I made a lot of progress, like finding out that this chronic depression is literally directly connected to shame, and that I am so overprotective of my mother that I hate myself for not being able to help her with her burdens. But I think there is something bigger that happened and I am suspecting emotional abuse. 

When I asked my mom about it though, she responded with ""Every couple argues"" and I am now suspecting that maybe I am overreacting or have exaggerated memories. She has suggested multiple memories to be an exaggeration and so maybe I am going crazy 

These are the things I do know:

\- My mom and dad argued, but it mainly seemed one-sided. My mom would mention something as small as him picking up after himself more and he would start blaming her for accusing him and stuff. But she didn't back down or become intimidated, so it sounded more like a one-sided argument than abuse. Sometimes she would grow silent or cry but i am not sure if this is a natural response in arguments or not because I usually do that as well

\- Sometimes he would throw things around the house and hit walls, but he never hit my mom. In private my mom told me he would occasionally bump into her and curse at her but I never witnessed it

\- My dad would always apologize later and say he was sorry for blowing up. If the whole family heard then he would apologize to us too. Sometimes he would go and get my mom something from the store or get us all food. I don't remember my mom being at fault for anything when an argument started; she would usually apologize early in a dispute before it became big.

\- Arguments were around normal things like cleaning problems and financial problems but would sometimes spiral into other things that were unrelated and my mom would try to bring my dad back on track

\- I learned to be quiet when they would argue, or he would accuse us of siding up with mom and sometimes bring up unrelated things. 

\- My dad never called my mom names or threatened her; the closest he got was saying my mom's dreams don't matter or saying that they were better off divorced

\- Most financial problems were his fault and when my mom offered to take over it always turned into a huge argument.

\- My dad would brag about how awesome mom was in public and how much he needed her, but mom would say she felt like a ""trophy"" when this happened. Not sure how significant this was but it showed me how different mom feels like she's treated in private?

\- I don't remember it being easy for my mom to leave an argument because my dad would follow her around the house and keep going, but I don't remember her being a victim to it because she would always stand her ground. When she would stand her ground that firmly my dad would be silent for a few days or even a week and, to me, it felt stressful being in an open space with either of them. But maybe people need some quiet time after arguing; i think that's normal? idk

\- They don't argue nearly as much anymore after my mom took over leading everything, from house organization to all the bill payments and bank accounts and all the meal planning and whatnot. For some reason that hurts my heart but I am not sure why? I just feel like I've never done enough for her

"Internalized racism is something that I have never talked about with anyone. It was always an extremely sensitive subject for me to confront, especially as a young boy. I was, well, a coon in my younger years.

From a very young age (I'd say it started when I was 11 or 12) I was never secure in my own black identity. It wasn't difficult for me to tell where African Americans truly stood on America's socioeconomic totem pole.

I knew it was low. I knew my black skin was a mark against me. I knew the black vernacular was a mark against me. I knew the stereotypes against black men. I knew that black girls were seen as mostly unattractive (even by other black dudes). I knew a lot of boys my age that were into redbones, yellowbones, mixed girls, latinas, and white girls (I was one of them). I knew the fact that I was from the ghettos would ""devalue"" me in the eyes of white America.

There was a time in the 6th or 7th grade when some black students and I made fun of a dark skinned black girl who had big lips and wore hair in a natural state (no weave, no anything). While I eventually stopped, others kept going. I always wonder how she is doing these days.

I'm more brown than dark but even I would get made fun of for my skin tone. I also had concerns about my brothers hair being ""better"" than mine. I would constantly compare my own hair texture to others. Thinking back, It was incredible how much I cared about that. I internalized most bad things people said about black people (especially black boys).

Hell, I was made fun of most of my childhood for being the nerdy kid but the one black girl who did like me....I was pretending not to notice, but I noticed. I was too busy trying to get the attention of a Latina girl who was already with someone. And her breath ended up stinking anyway. I rejected a girl who showed genuine interest so I could chase a non-black girl who didn't even like me. This is very embarrassing in hindsight.

My desire for validation from the dominant group in America led to me rejecting many aspects of black culture. I hated street rap music. Why? Because it epitomized all the negative stereotypes about black males that I didn't want associated with me. The drugs, the black vernacular, the misogyny, the violence, the poverty, the degeneracy. I wanted NOTHING to do with any of it.

It also didn't help that when I was started watching WWE, I developed an appreciation for rock, metal, and electronic music. These particular appreciations were genuine (not influenced by anti-blackness). But the black community would not have it. I was often teased for my taste in music by other black kids (including my family). When I played my music out loud like everyone else, I was promptly told to shut that trash off. 

I also paid far more attention to my academics than most black kids in my school. The only time most of them even wanted to be near me was so I could do their homework. After that, it was right back to bullying me. Talking about the shape of my head, my nose size, my music taste, my shortness.

All the things in the previous few paragraphs further alienated me from black kids. It lead to me not associating any of my interest with black people.

Up until the 7th grade, the black vernacular came likr second nature. But my white English teacher would always seek to correct us when we spoke grammatical ""errors"". She taught me that ebonics = bad and standard white, middle class = good. So.....I emulated it. Now, in 8th grade, high school, and upwards...""white"" English became second nature to me. I allowed my teacher's anti-black sentiments to make me hide my native tongue to the point where it felt strange to hear. It's like I don't even know my old self anymore.

It wasn't until I was around 16 until began to noticed that I am kind of a coon. This is why always discuss issues of colorism, internalized racism, and black people's negative self-image on this app. I know what it can do to a young boy. It damaged me. It turned me against my own race for someone the most important years of my childhood. Learning to appreciate blackness, black beauty, and black culture while still trying to fight threw this white wilderness our ancestors were brought to is so tough."	july_grdens	post	15.727517243760882	male	White	0.9943769574165344	na	na	na	4	BlackMentalHealth

Me too, being married to a white guy, having mental health issues since ever, only a few friends and they live no where near me. The emotions do pass and change, no matter how strong, and if you are aware of your strongest symptoms it's best to start there with self help books and lean into healthy hobbies, no force, be gentle with yourself, even if it means doing nothing for hours, do it with the intention of being gentle with yourself.

"I'm so sorry you believe you are at the end of your rope. I'm so glad you reached out here for help. I'm hoping you have gotten some good advice and support from folks here.

I wanted to address a few things you mentioned:
- You mentioned that you have had many diagnoses but none seem to fit you. I noticed you used the words ""self harm"" and mentioned you were having trouble with your relationships, esp. your husband and daughter you've been feeling disconnected from them. Have you ever spoke to your doctor's about BPD? (Borderline personality disorder) I have BPD and have similar symptoms so this is just a suggestion to speak with your doctor about it. Do your research first and see if your symptoms might line up and then talk to your doctor/therapist about it.
- I too married outside my race and I feel disconnected at times. I also have to think about even if I married a Black man that I would still feel this disconnect as well.

"""(Anger) announces that we have been violated, that our rights have been trampled, that our needs are being ignored, that we are avoiding an important emotional issue, or that signifigant pieces of ourselves--our values, desires, beliefs--have been compromised. Anger is a profound yes to life when everything else is strangling us. Anger surfaces from deep within our gut. It demands that we pay attention. It says, ""listen up, something intolerable is happening."" - Adele Wilcox, *Mending Broken Hearts* 

I know this might sound obvious to some, but... I lean into it and work to figure out why I'm angry in the first place.  I can only speak for myself, but it helps me to remember that anger is a valid emotion.  I always feel a deep sense of shame and wrongness when I get mad, but that's how some of us are socialized as women. I've also been dignosed (within the last two years) as a person with Autism, so I'm trying to re-aquaint myself with my feelings so to speak instead of shutting off whenever I get uncomfortable, angry, etc.

I struggle with anger. I've been told my whole life that I am only *allowed* be angry when somebody does something intentional and malicious toward me, and even then that I ""should"" try to ignore how I feel and be compassionate toward them - to be okay with them valuing their comfort over my own and assuming I'll do the same. It's one of the biggest issues I struggle with around setting boundaries. 

So I now work to remind myself that it's okay to feel angry, even if the person didn't mean to do whatever or have a justification, etc. that I can still be angry and my sympathy toward them/their situation/their choices doesn't automatically negate my feelngs or make the feelings I have wrong or invalid.

Once I've worked through the how/why, I then check in to see what (if any) healthy action exists. Do I want to establish a boundary somewhere? Do I need to move that bag I keep tripping over? Did I have enough water/snacks/sleep? Basically, what can I do to address this?

Physical outlets (both long-term and in the moment) include breathing exercises, yoga, journaling, crying it out, coloring, or deep diving into a complicated recipe that requires attention to detail/focus."	1BubbleGum_Princess	reply	na	na	na	0.003691684687510133	no	no	no	na	BlackMentalHealth

"I honestly feel that my anxiety and depression is coming back on me full throttle. It's getting difficult, I won't lie. I feel like I haven't done much in the last few years... Well let me take that back. I graduated college with a B.S. in Criminal Justice. I have traveled more this year than ever. Yet, I still feel like I haven't done much with my life. I'm not happy as I would like to be.

I don't have friends. I'm socially awkward and I live in my head basically. I'm into weird things so you'd mostly find me watching videogame playthroughs on YouTube or binging true crime. Most times I prefer to be alone but sometimes I want company. Ironic, right?

The top 2 things I'm struggling most with would be...

* Being my own enemy (I tend to get in the way of my own success & I can be very harsh on myself).
* I'm struggling to find my own self-identity. I feel like I live through other people.

I've considered myself to be ""Captain Save-A-Bitch"" for everyone else but myself and I can't seem to understand why. My early 20s were spent dealing with mental problems in high gear... So I didn't get a chance to enjoy much of it. I don't expect some reply or begging for friendship or whatever. I guess I just wanted someone to listen.

Thanks for reading & sorry for the rambling,

Myrrth"	Mrryth	post	22.811604934640496	female	White	0.9932386875152588	na	na	na	1	BlackMentalHealth
"Just wanted to say you're definitely not alone and I've had somewhat of a similar experience as far as being my own enemy/self-sabotage, struggling w/my identity, living in my head/being socially awkward, and being the one to always save/help others.

I've personally always put myself on a back burner, convinced I didn't need to put myself first or need a lot of care bc there were more ""important things."" Looking back, it's disheartening to see how lowly I thought of myself that I ruined chances to better my situation some, downplayed my achievements, denied myself meaningful relationships, and exhausted myself for others. Mental illness definitely clouds your brain and keeps you from greatness.

I'm also turning 25 in less than 3 months and I have yet to really receive any help. I've been struggling w/my mental illnesses and lost nearly half of my 20s atp to it. I rarely got to do anything a 20-something would do and it'll be that way for a while longer unfortunately. So I didn't get to enjoy much of anything and I'm trying to mourn for that missed time. ://///

Also I wouldn't consider watching video game playthroughs and true crime to be ""weird."" Me and my brothers do the same thing sorta. I do a bit of both sometimes(well I mainly watch ManlyBadassHero as far as games go) and so does my brother. Our little brother watches playthroughs a bit more often. My dad is a lover of true crime, he watches it all the time and even falls to sleep to it. So again you're not alone there, a lot of ppl enjoy those as far as I know."

"So my mom got mad that I took long to get home,I use Access. I gave them the address for Yard House and I asked the driver and he said that he had another passenger so he couldn't pick me up when I was waiting at the place he was supposed to pick me up at and he said that they didn't give him the address for Yard house unlike the 1st driver that drove me there.
It's so frustrating cause I gave them the address too and they told the other lady but not him.

To say that it‚Äôs ‚Äúall‚Äù we do is to grossly discredit the vast impact we are making on society and culture. How deeply we are leaving our footprint and how far we have come in the fight for equality and justice. We still have a long way to go..but we certainly have a lot more to celebrate and enjoy.

"I have been waiting to be seen by a therapist since 2018. I finally made a breakthrough after some sessions of equine therapy and was ready to begin my healing journey. But then my therapy at the VA was placed on pause, indefinitely, because my therapist was offered a new job position. The VA acted as if I was asking for too much just because I wanted to work with a female therapist. I agreed to EMDR and that was later placed on pause, indefinitely, because of COVID. So I decided to leave the VA and try BetterHelp, out of desperation. I left BetterHelp because I was placed with an unreliable therapist. I tried setting up an appointment with a therapist that was local to me just for her to cancel our very first session on the day of. 
I'm beyond frustrated - how can I even begin my healing journey when I keep running into roadblocks? It's feeling like wanting to become a better version of myself is asking for too much... Like why is it so hard for a therapist to meet me where I'm at?

"This post may fall on deaf ears, but I‚Äôve been really introspective with myself in why I am not naturally attracted to black males. 

I‚Äôve pondered self hate, societal stigmas, stereotypes, etc. but I have come to the conclusion that they remind me of my dad‚Ä¶ and obviously no one wants to think of their father with a romantic partner. 

For the record, I have a great relationship with my dad. I feel like I can tell him anything, he‚Äôs so supportive even though we live across the country from each other. He made my lunches and cooked dinner for us up until college. He did all the grocery shopping and always distinguished what I like vs my sister and mom. He taught me how to drive. He has done so much for me. I love that man. 

But I can‚Äôt understand why my brain is so averted to being romantically attracted to anyone that reminds me of him. It‚Äôs so weird. I don‚Äôt think I need to be with a black man, I‚Äôd date anyone that treats me right. I guess I‚Äôm just trying to better understand myself.

"The brain works in mysterious way and it could be a lot of different factors. I think when you meet a black man who treats you right it brings up memories of your dad and how he treated you so it‚Äôs easy to compare the two.
