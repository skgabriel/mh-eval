So, a few weeks ago I started talking to him less and less. I haven't been feeling well mentally for a few months. I told him about the various things that I have been stressing about. However I did not include one major change in my life. I came out as gender fluid last week. This is something that I had been debating telling him as his views on LGBTQ+ are a little unclear to me and one of the main reasons why I stopped being as social towards him. Almost directly after I came out, he started posting about his dates w new gf. What hurts the most is that 1. he didn't even have the decency to break up with me, and 2. I had told him that he was pretty much my only and best friend. I don't have anyone to turn to to vent my feelings and now I just feel so painfully alone.

"Going through this kind of thing is hard, especially when that person is the only one your close with. People will say not to dwell on it or to focus on yourself but that isn’t always easy to do, especially when you don’t really have anyone you know to vent to about it. I suggest not following any of their socials anymore as seeing those posts won’t help the situation. 
I hope you feel better and make some new and better connections soon, and there are tons of people on this sub and many other forums who love to be a listening ear. Don’t hesitate to reach out more online, it’s a great tool to cope with losing a connection with someone."	Murky_Ad2008	reply	na	na	na	0.9990942478179932	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealth
I got blocked practically overnight by my bf. We haven’t texted for 2 months and I’ll probably never hear from him again. I still miss him every day. People have advice but none of it stops me from thinking about him when I’m alone at night. It sucks and I think the only way forward is to fall for someone new. But it’s not easy.

"I have a real moral dilemma. This friend of mine has been talking about killing themself for at least a year now and in some ways has become more descriptive. I feel like I am doing the wrong thing by not calling a hospital or something because not a single one of my words has worked and I worry that any day now could be her last.

She had told me that she will hate me forever if I do this but I think this is just the anti-help reaction that happens to people with mental illness, I adamantly refused help when I was anorexic. I would've hated help then but I realise now in my right mind it would've been good for me.

She clearly isn't in her right mind, so part of me feels like I have to make this choice for her. The other part does not want to, with such a personal thing, spit in the face of her wishes.

I don't know what the right answer is. I want to hear more things since I can't make up my mind with just this."	CovalentMolecule183	post	22.96469534111293	male	White	0.9967473745346069	na	na	na	9	MentalHealth

"I feel completely hopeless about talking with women because they never seem open to me. It always feels like I have to prove so much to them. Meanwhile my male friends are usually very impressed with me for my thoughtfulness. I don't know how to get close enough with a women for personalities to matter, though. I have very high walls and inhibitions due to strict religious upbringing and through, continuous emotional and physical abuse from my parents, which are both estranged from me. 

Mentally I feel like I'm free from religion and the abuse. I have moved on to other hobbies and debates. Physically and romantically I have never been less free. I never had a healthy example of what a women should be in my life. My mother and father married months after meeting. Their marriage had no vitality or love, let alone  caretaking ability. Only my earliest childhood memories are untouched by violence and cold impersonal parents. I have no father, only a brutish creature of rage and might makes right, created by what were essentially the slums of Utah. 

I feel like I have nothing to offer a women, no adventure or warmth like you see in the movies. I can only know intimacy in an intellectual or strictly physical sense. There have been girls that approached me, but I rejected interactions with them when I saw that they felt pity for me. 

Now I'm more open after therapy, but I never go outside. I have learned to hate clubs, tinder, lots of senerios where one might meet girls. Thinks feel complicated, and I don't want to be manipulated again. I also am deathly afraid of becoming a sadistic brute like my father, unloved but endured out of necessity. When I'm finally ready to open myself, it's like I'm dashing myself against the walls of other people who already learned to ignore or distance themselves from me. 

In addition, online, where I find solstice, dating rhetoric seems to be strongly defensive on the part of women. Men are creeps, misogynists and incels for the most innocous reasons like expressing opinions people don't like. It's like men aren't allowed to feel anything or make mistakes. Like a date is a job interview and the man is the candidate. Obviously, this isn't the case for everyone, reddit is filled with unhealthy people. But this resonates with me. I can't love someone that is only interested in cynically crossing off red flags or flexing my replacibility on me. If I have to be so much for a chance to get close to you, how am I gonna think of you as anything but a prize or some sort of possession? Easily lost and finicky. I have no faith in that sort of relationship lasting. 

This all leads to me taking on a really platonic approach to any girl that I get close with emotionally, like friends or classmates. They lose interest quickly because I'm too afraid to express interest when I actually care. 

One time I had a crush on a girl at the library I worked at, and she came over to express sympathy about my bloody nose (it was really dry that day). She was really nice about it, and this was the first time we'd talked.  I was so shocked someone noticed and cared that I was hurt that I didn't know what to say. I didn't want to complain and sound annoying/bitter. So I was just really professional and sort of stiffly introduced myself. She asked if I hated that she was babying me...like if this was ""my worse fear"". I was actually unreasonably touched but the explanation was so complicated I didn't know what to say without weirding her out. I just made awkward conversation changing the subject. Everyone else came and expressed sympathy too and I was just overloaded. I felt like I was disappointing them by being stiff and kept saying thank you. 

It made me feel robotic, and I remember thinking that this must be why I can't get a girlfriend.

The problem is I have such a strong need for some sense of family or emotional intimacy that in the past I have had a really strong drive to just find anyone who would have me and do whatever they want. I've grown a lot sense then, and I'm on a ton of meds that make me productive and safer. Problems is that now I feel nothing for anyone. When I do, it's someone one tinder, where people are only looking for really shallow sort of show pony style bonding and then hook ups. I am miserable, because I can't make it clear I have romantic intentions with a women without sounding super defensive and robotic. Like I'm striking a deal.

when I approach I'm usually rejected, but I don't know if I can really blame my looks with all that going on. Someone once told me I should just not date if I have all these problems, but how am I supposed to get better without practice and someone to open up to? I already have friends. The female ones never wanna hear me open up, because it's too intimate I think. Too close to romance. They judge me harshly for my awkwardness. 

Any tips for me to approach women in person and become a more open person?"	Incognitotreestump22	post	27.483166921845047	male	White	0.9941520094871521	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
If you’re in public and happen to see a girl who you think is pretty, just walk right and ask for their name, then introduce yourself, then ask them for their number. 99.9% of them will tell you “no” or “I have a bf.” Then you say, okay, I didn’t mean any disrespect, have a good day. And walk away. Be stoic the whole time. And don’t take it personal. These women know nothing about you, so again, don’t take it personal. I’m very good looking, and I’m telling you most women have told me no. If you start to take it personally, it’ll kill your self esteem. There’s a lot of women out there, and at some point one of them will say yes.	Incognitotreestump22	reply	na	na	na	0.9941520094871521	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth

"When people talk about battles and struggles, I like to point out that there are surprisingly easy things that can help.  
  
The treatments for anxiety and depression are not exactly the same, but they have some things in common. For example, relaxation helps with both problems. Reducing stress is good for anxiety and depression. Calming down helps you to think carefully about the thoughts that bother you. Slow breathing is especially good for this.  
  
  
Activity, especially physical activity, is good for depression.  
  
Even exercise is easy if you do it the right way. Light exercise, like 20 min of brisk walking a day, can help, and you can add to that gradually so long as you don't make yourself sick of exercise with too much.  
  
I'm not saying that self-help is all you need, but there's a number of good things.  
  
The beauty of self-help is that you have a variety of low cost, low risk things that can be combined with each other, and with standard treatments with office visits. While it's not clear at this time that any one of these things is as effective as an antidepressant, it's common sense that if a variety of reasonably good things are combined with each other, they will have considerable effect.  
I can't tell you exactly what you need. There's no one size fits all solution. I can tell you though that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits.

"Yes. Feeling a deep sadness that manifests physically is actually quite common, and it can be really tough to deal with. Let me share a personal story from my own life that might resonate with you and provide some insight.  
  
A while back, I went through a challenging period in my life. I had experienced a series of setbacks and disappointments, and it felt like everything was falling apart. There were moments when I felt an intense sadness deep within me, and it often manifested as a tightness in my chest, almost like a heavy weight pressing down on me.  
  
During that time, I learned that our emotions and our bodies are deeply interconnected. Even though I wasn't physically crying, the emotional pain I was experiencing was finding its way into my body, manifesting as a physical sensation.

[The physical sensation of chest pain or tightness during intense sadness can be attributed to increased muscle tension, altered breathing patterns, and the impact of emotional pain on the nervous system.](https://www.livewelltalk.com/2022/12/physical-symptoms-of-clinical-depression.html)"	Decent-Apartment-533	reply	na	na	na	0.9772820472717285	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealth

My best friend of several years recently moved away to the other side of the world a week ago and I've felt depressed ever since. I've known it was coming for nearly a year but it never really sank in until we said goodbye. I'm having a really hard time adjusting to the change of going from seeing them nearly every day to maybe seeing them once a year and maybe not even that. I know staying in touch is easier now than it ever has been but I worry that over time we're inevitably going to drift apart just because we won't see each other face to face anymore.

I've had an unfortunate amount of experience with dpdr due to psychedelic use what I was quite young. While this may not apply to you, I found it mostly fades but it takes time and intent. Things focused on  grounding and awareness tend to help; things like meditation, physical activity and forms of psychotherapy. The worst thing for dealing with it in my experience was getting fixated on it. Focusing on the symptoms rather than what's going on around you further detaches you from reality, and increases anxiety which makes it worse. All the best, I hope that helps	PersonalityWarm9451	reply	na	na	na	0.9990265369415283	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealth
"Hi all,  


I (27F) just want an opinion on my mother who I think has become extremely overbearing especially the past few years.Growing up in an asian household has always been difficult as far as I remember. It was constantly “you’re not doing enough” “you don’t want to grow up to be like one of those people” “you got 80s in your tests? why not 90s?” “why can’t you be like \[insert friend’s kid’s name\]”. My brothers have always been high achievers but I was average, did pretty well in school IMHO but I wasn’t interested in many extra-curricular activities. She always thought the worst of me and was never shy to convey that to me or anyone else around me.  


I moved to another country to study when I was 17 and stayed on to work after my studies. When I moved here, I felt extremely free and that I could do the things I wanted to without being nagged 24/7. I would FaceTime my parents once every couple of weeks to catch up and also message back and forth. When I started my first job (just 3 years ago), my life started becoming hectic, I work many hours a week and try to catch up on some me time over the weekend. My mother would not stop messaging me and every time she messaged me it would be something she disagrees on and makes me feel awful. So I stopped messaging her as frequently as I used to as she started becoming too overbearing.  


For example, with my recent ex-boyfriend, I tried to speak to her about the issues with our relationship but her response was “you will never find someone better than him” “if you dump him, I pity whoever is going to date you next” “he loves you so much, why are you so horrible to him?”. I sternly told her that I am a grown up and I can make my own decisions, and I know what’s best for me. She did not take this very well and started saying how disrespectful and unappreciative I am to her as her daughter. She even said things like “you have brought nothing but pain to my life” “do not ever speak to me again” “I hope you look back one day and regret what you’ve done to me”. I then told her that I am not tolerating this attitude or behaviour of hers where she keeps putting me down and making me feel like I’m not capable of making my own decisions. She then said never to speak to her again which I did not until…  


3 months later (two weeks ago), I broke up with my ex-boyfriend. Bear in mind, this was a mutual break up as our life goals started changing and no longer align. My boyfriend was the one who told her. I wasn’t ready but she messages him everyday and he probably wanted to just get her off his back. She made me feel horrible about this break up and made me feel as if this was a wrong decision. I told her clearly via FaceTime that this was mutual and I am happy and optimistic that I will find someone who will suit me in the future. I reassured her that I am fine and I want some space for myself. A few days after the break up, she kept messaging me saying how upset she is with me and kept saying things like “it’s alright, he isn’t there for you anymore, he longer wants to support you, you’re now all alone”. I have not responded to any of her messages.  


She bombarded me today with 10-15 messages about how shit my life decisions are along with a video of something really stupid with no scientific evidence. I then told her angrily “please do not watch these videos as they are dumb and do not make sense”. She then responded again with things like “where did you learn to become so rude to your mother?” “Do not speak to me again” “I will not bother you anymore and I hope you regret this for the rest of your life”.

I am actually more upset and on edge all day everyday for the past 2 weeks about my mother than the break up with my long term boyfriend. I feel absolutely drained from this drama.

There are lots of other things too but this was recent one.I just want this to stop. Will I be a horrible daughter if I told her that I do not want to speak to her again? (Well unless she stops being unreasonable and overbearing)

"Yeah... 

I've dealt with included or medicated mental health issues my entire life. I'm 39 now and only on the last 2 years started doing something about it. Got therapy, proper meds, etc.

But before all this, for years I'd occasionally just kind of be like, 'this shit isn't normal.

It's not normal to have an incredible hulk style temper that can be set off for no reason. It's not normal to have everyone around you including yourself walking on eggshells 24/7 in fear of you going off. (Thankfully I'm not physically violent, but when i get set off, i feel like I'm only one step away from it going there). Im combative and confrontational with everyone from relatives, strangers, bosses, customers all the time. 

I've bounced from job to job my entire life. (Somehow never fired) My current job of 3 years is the longest I've been employed at a place in almost 10 years. 

Depression, anxiety, bi polar disorder, a bad temper and 15 years of self medicating with alcohol is a bad combo.

I've since realized i can't keep living like this for my kids sake. I can't repeat the cycle of mental health issues and mental/emotional abuse i dealt with that led to this shit.

I started seeing therapists and got lucky by finding a medication combo that works on the first try. (Lamotragine and sertraline).

I stopped drinking 3 years ago and switched to weed and have since taken a 180° and fell like a completely different person. It's still a work in progress as I'm basically learning to be a rational, calm and collected adult for the first time, but everyone's lives around me have significantly improved. 

If you know something's off, for your own sake find someone to talk to, and get on meds. Getting a therapist isn't an easy thing as I've bounced around until i found one i actually like and trust. But you have to be honest with them about whatever you talk about, otherwise you won't get anywhere.

"Teenage love can be quite the wallop. 

But also, you're a teenager. There's a lot of potential in front of you, and chances are there are a lot of things you could dive into. Whether it's schooling, your friends, hobbies, or other young women of interest, this is the time to practice refocusing your attention.

Your thoughts will inevitably drift to your crush. You have to intervene for yourself there - talk to yourself, write it out, snap a rubber band on your wrist, whatever. Do whatever it takes to bring you back from focusing on her to focusing on the present, where you're at and who you're with.

It'll take some practice, but you'll definitely get better at paying attention to what's in front of you. Try to have fun, whatever it is. You're still quite young, and there's a lot to experience :)"	Logical_Standard9949	reply	na	na	na	0.011452006176114082	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealth

This was the worst year of my life. I'm 20 and was enrolled in a college where teachers were bullshitting us with shitty courses and I just couldn't see the point of it, I originally went to college to please my parents but I just don't fit into the school system. I've failed because my ratings were not good enough, not because I wasn't working but because I had to work on my portfolio beside classes to put it up to date with the industry's standards (it was a graphic design school) because they weren't  giving projects that would be a good fit for employers. And the worst thing is that I was finally having some employers interested in my work and that wanted to interview me. My school had an apprenticeship program with companies starting on second year. Now I want to pursue web development now because that's one of the only things I'm good at and because I just like coding but enrollment for next year are over and I can only either wait for the year after this one or self-learn it. Even though I'm highly disciplined and motivated, my confidence is damn low and I don't want to disappoint my parents who put thousands of bucks into my tuition. Right now I feel like I want to end it all. But I can't because my parents sacrificed so many things for me and I want to make up for this.

"So i quite literally can‘t take it anymore. I‘m lonely as fuck and have only one single friend. At least that’s what i like to think. I can’t express my feelings whatsoever so i can’t even ask him if we’re friends or what he thinks of me. We don’t really do much together apart from gaming but i really enjoy spending time with him. At the same time im scared that im bothering him by always being the one to ask him if he wants to do something and feel like im just annoying.
Spending time with him is my way of escaping my shitty life. For an extended time period I haven’t managed to escape anymore tho and my mental health problems became more concrete. I have been thinking about seeking therapy since i am now dealing with actual plans for suicide and harmed myself while i was drunk.
I really don’t want this to sound like the dude needs to spend more time with me because i know that that’s not true. The issue is that i have literally no on else. Thinking about that, i realised that maybe getting a pet would help me. So yeah, i really like cats and I’m now wondering if it might be a good idea to get one, since I’ll have some time on my hands from next week onwards when i don’t really have to do anything and I’m scared that i‘ll just spend the entire next month in bed wishing i was dead.

"I really do, I’m worthless with no one who really cares about me. Sure I have family that “cares” for me but only because I was born into the family and that have familial loyalty it’s nothing about me as a person. I thought I was ok being alone, I tricked myself into believing that for years but it was just lie I was telling myself to protect myself.

I don’t want to be alone but how can I ever expect anyone to care/love me if I hate myself. I’ve tried doing the right things I’ve lost weight I’ve tried to be more social and get new friends. But I still hate myself I still know I’m worthless and that I don’t deserve love. I’m a failure that ruins everything I touch, if I’m involved in something it just gets worse. No matter how hard I try nothing is ever good enough. 

I thought when I start losing weight and getting social was making a difference and it that maybe just maybe I could put my self hatred behind me. But months went by and nothing changed. My self hatred came back stronger than ever before.

I think I’ve been like this for to long and that I’m truly broken beyond repair. Every time I try being mentally positive there’s another little voice in the back of my head that says I’m worthless and why bother. I’m just so tired of feeling this way and just need to vent.

"A little preface - what the post is about:
I live in a country that is at war.
I can't find a job despite it is required of me.
I found a calling that I love, but parents don't let me do it.
I can't find a girl.
I am overweight.

Firstly, I graduated from the Ukrainian IT University 3 years ago.
In my third year of college, I realized that I didn't want to be a programmer, even though I had excellent grades.
I hate coding. Absolutely everything related to debugging code causes me uncontrollable anger and frustration. I can no longer spend 3 hours looking for a solution to 5 errors in the code that have nothing to do with the logic of the algorithm and are caused only by the specifics of the programming language. Even the thought that I need to learn a programming language makes my hands tremble and makes me irritable.
After graduating from college, I told my mom that I didn't want to be a programmer and I didn't want to go to an IT university. I want to find what I like in life.
The mother replied: “Do you understand what you are going to live on while you are looking for yourself? Without education, you will not be hired anywhere. Finish university, get a job, and then do whatever you want with your life.""
In the end, I did. All the time I was studying, I thought that all the roads were open in front of me and I could do anything in life. I thought only lazy people can't find a job. As a student, I could find any part-time job at gas stations, call centers and “McDonalds”s. I thought that when I graduated from university, I would take my diploma, go to the lowest paid job as a programmer, after a couple of years I would plow there, and try new things in my free time. That’s how I thoght until I graduated from university that I realized how wrong I was.
As soon as I graduated from university, all the ""doors"" of employers for students were closed. No one read my resume on job sites, my phone never rang. Attempts to look for work not in my specialty were also unsuccessful. Only then did I realize that in fact all the doors closed for me at the age of 15, when I first crossed the threshold of my IT college.
The main problem is that IT colleges and IT universities do not teach the necessary knowledge for work. It doesn't bother anyone at all. In Ukrainian colleges, they will forcefully teach a ton of useless subjects in modern meta-coding - from numerical methods to patent law. When I opened the job requirements, I lost heart. I spent 8 years studying to say that I know object oriented programming, I know 1997 database technologies and I can write code in 5 programming languages. But what else do I need:
- Framework #1 - unstudied
- Framework #2 - unstudied
- Framework #3 - unstudied
- Git technology - unlearned
- Modern wrapper for databases NameA - did not sound.
- I have no real experience with real projects from one year.
- I don't have a portfolio of works.
While I was ""looking for a job"" after a bad experience as a gas station cashier, I tried my hand at editing videos for YouTube. I have never been so inspired by what I do. The progress in motivation compared to what it was with programming was incredible for me. I worked on videos for 12 hours a day. When I started uploading videos, I saw that I get 100-300 views on the first five videos, while other beginner youtubers could not get more than 10.
It is obvious that it is quite difficult to get money from YouTube without monetization and audience’s support right away.
After the scandal, the mother said that she would help for some time, but if there were no successes, she would stop. When they donated the first five dollars to me, she seemed to be delighted, but completely stopped taking this idea seriously. She seems to deliberately ignore what I do in general, constantly distracting me and giving useless tasks since I have ""a lot of free time.""
When the war started in Ukraine, the job industry got f~ed. They began to take all the men from work and send them to the front line. The same goes for any men on the street.
25% of the population in Ukraine is unemployed.
Rewinding time forward to today, after 450 days of the war, they parents began to “softly” hint to me that it was time to look for a job.
During the war, my mother does not let me go outside even for shopping. That doesn’t disturb her to propose me work at a constructions.
Since there is a war now, I cannot work in the office or on the street - that is, it is only remote work. Remote work without work experience is either work in a call center, or work as a dispatcher for transportation in America (this is how it works in Ukraine). Accordingly, I have a very small selection of vacancies and a giant wall of “HR-managers” with gigantic unrealistic requirements.
At the moment I live in a village where there is not much to talk to, so I can’t even count on meeting girls, I can’t even find friends.
Even if suddenly a lonely lady was found in my neighboring house, agreeing to spend some time, she would not be very pleased to communicate with me because im overweight (175 cm, 100 kg). I stopped eating sweets and started to lose a decent amount of weight, but it will take a long time anyway. Btw I'm a virgin at 26.
My question is what to do with all this?
Everything is so bad that I can’t even ask a good question.

P.S.
Today I was contacted by the HR of a travel company and she offered a job as a dispatcher. I have an interview tomorrow. I doubt that I need it. I understand that I sound now like a manchild but hear me out.
At the moment we have enough money to survive. We do not save money, but so far we have everything. When I asked my mother what they were going to spend my money on (I expected that this money would be safely taken from me), she replied “that it will be your money, if you want, spend it on entertainment or shopping or save it for what you need”.
As a result, I have many questions.
How will I spend money on entertainment if I can be caught and mobilized to the front? What exactly should I buy if I can't go to the store?
I can’t even rent an apartment for such a salary, that is, it’s no luck to move out from my parents. From all this I draw one conclusion. They demand a job from me simply because “Well, why do we work and you don’t?” Despite the fact that there is no talk of taking money from me for rent or food.
So that's why I think I don't need a job - because for me at the moment the TIME spent on my channel is more important than money. And if I don't have time, I don't need money. But if I don't find a job, they will pester me every day, accusing me of lazyness. Should I accept a job offer?"	shogun_raccoon	post	23.09834436506173	male	White	0.9978542923927307	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
Wow , I went through the same situation some 2 years ago, I wanted to do a lot of stuff but I couldn't because of some shit going into my family, luckily our country was not at war but unemployment is a major issue here in India. I graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering and realised we don't have many opportunities here except working in the private factories. I didn't know what I wanted to do in life, my friends were going into the IT field, learning programming and it helped them make decent money (IT sector is profiting in India) . I stayed with my parents, they never pushed me to get a job, they had enough money. But all of sudden it changed, they wanted me to get a job cause having an employed son isn't acceptable in society. I had no opportunities cause no company was willing to hire me because of my 5 year gap . I never had any work experience. But then I got an offer for an interview one of my relatives organised. I accepted the offer even though it wasn't my dream job , I moved out and it opened doors for many possibilities, I changed jobs and made  connections. Now I have 2 years of job experience and I don't feel like a loser, I'm willing to work hard to be able to do what I  actually want to do . My advice would be to accept the offer and move out, take time out for yourself and learn stuff that could help you teach stuff you never learned in University	shogun_raccoon	reply	na	na	na	0.9978542923927307	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealth
"Really. Someone tell me. How do people balance all the heartache, stress, and responsibilities in their entire lives?  I'm 23F and i have no clue how I'm supposed to keep doing everything that comes with just being alive everyday. I'm already dreading every future problem along with my current ones. I can barely eat, shower, or brush my teeth without having to convince myself, how am i supposed to do that AND face every life challenge that'll inevitably come my way, even the simplest ones? A lot of the time i think that i'm not supposed to be alive because i'm simply not built to handle all this. I don't currently have any plans to take my life, but i often fantasize that i'll be able to be free from every plaguing thought--or at least get a break from responsibilities if i survive.  
I feel guilty for thinking this way because i'm in a very lucky and privileged position in life.

"You're talking about being stressed out and, although stress reduction is probably a good idea, I'm not saying that this is all you need.

For one thing, the most common cause of depression is prolonged high stress, so depression is a possible diagnosis.

But stress management is important for those who are prone to depression - good for prevention and it helps with recovery.

I'm not trying to diagnose, but I want you to about how to cope with suicidal feelings and what to do about depression.

The self-help methods for depression are mostly stress reduction. These can help a lot but dealing with a serious problem with only self-help is very risky.

A lot of things can help, mostly things that are easy. Details here -

The most important thing is knowing how to cope in a moment of crisis. It's very important to calm down. This will make you feel better and let you think clearly. A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical Behavior Therapy, which helps people who have BPD, recommends this - breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK.

Simple distractions can help. The video below shows you distractions that can calm you down, also a safe hotline. No one will bother you if you call.

Now my parents found a lady for me to get married. As my aggression is back and frustration too. Are there chances that i may end up in domestic violence?

"  
  
   
It's great that you're making progress.

I don't know if there's a real danger of violence, but angry words can wreck a marriage.  
  
Anger can be complicated, but having a good way to chill when we're upset can make a huge difference.  
  
I'll give you some good chill advice and advice for avoiding arguments.  
  
**Look before you leap!**  
  
When you feel that you're about to say something hurtful, stop, slow down, and relax so you can think clearly.  
  
The truth can be told different ways - not all of them hurtful. That is diplomacy in a nutshell.  
  
 This is what borderline personality disorder patients are told to do - breathe slowly and gently while counting seconds - 5 sec. to inhale, 7 sec. to exhale.  
  
The evidence for therapeutic breathing is amazing. It's used to treat panic disorder and PTSD.   
  
Whatever changes your mood - a funny movie or smoothing music - is good.   
  
When we calmly consider our anger, it ceases to be anger.   
  
We all get angry sometimes. So long as anger is not connected to a plan to do someone harm and we don't hold on to it, anger is just an unpleasant feeling that comes and goes, like a thunderstorm.

Recently I’ve noticed that unless I’m busy or fully immersed in a task, that I think about my mental health constantly. I’m thinking about how I’m feeling, how I’m frustrated that I have to deal with mental health problems in the first place, angry about trauma, etc. Even when I am busy some of these things will randomly pop into my head. Also, during many moments, I’m thinking about how I’m going to tell my therapist about whatever happened. And then on top of that I miss my T all the time and the desire to talk to her, often takes me away from the present moment. A couple years ago I never used to think like this and now I feel like it’s all I do. Has anyone else experienced this? Idk how to make it stop and I just want to live a “normal” life.

I cant affort therapy and i dont have anyone in real life understanding or close enough to talk about this so reddit my only support at this point. She would verbally abuse me daily, calling me worthless, good for nothing, and would also berate me over pretty issues which has caused my mental health to deteriorate to the point i feel like cant go on a day longer anymore. Ive been thinking about suicide alot or running away from home, i still havent managed to get employed, im trying but my mental health is still deteriorating. Like no matter what i do, she will always find something to get angry over, i try keep everything perfect in hopes of her not getting mad but there is no point it seems. Then she will also take out her anger on my looks and weight, she would criticise my looks, would ignore me and would also criticise in front of others in hopes of humiliating me. daily, im just getting closer to wanting to end it now.	flowery9777	post	37.19317947793756	female	White	0.999437153339386	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth

"I'm done with life right now. I went into my therapy session today feeling okay, but came out feeling 10x worse. My therapist (unintentionally) pissed me off and I ended up being quite angry towards her. Fortunately, we were able to talk it out, but it's left me feeling so drained. So tired. 

The bright side is that we uncovered a lot and I feel we made some kind of breakthrough; it was primarily to do with my deep seated anger. That said, I feel like I use my anger to survive. The ""fire"" inside me is the only thing keeping me alive; I'm living out of pure spite.

I hate having this much anger, so I do want this to change. I just don't know myself in any other way, which actually scares me. At this point, I just want the pain to stop."	Disillusioned_Femme	post	7.895253051846284	male	White	0.999349057674408	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
"Honestly I feel similar. I get that feeling of hate. I have it right now. It's more resentment than hate.

I was let into an IOP program in March only to be put into limbo and told not to come after the first orientation. My behavior apparently was what they felt was right for the program. Like. I'm sorry but if you promised a break please don't make it an issue that I asked for the break when it was due. 

They try to cut time for breaks so they can push content. Anyways. I felt alienated and shit. It was my adhd still is. However I saw a psychiatrist who had increase my dose of vyvanse to help me. Long story short he basically vouched that I should try going to the program again.

Today I got a call from one of the people from that group and she continued to dismiss my issues. Leaning toward the excuse that that's just how it is and there's more than you in the program. Anyways she got me so mad.

I cried then called the suicide hotline. I was not doing well I was nauseated. Also I was and kinda still am at work was really thinking of going home. Just kinda did my best not to talk to anyone or make eye contact.

"I'm literally at my limit. I've always had bad social anxiety and now it's starting to ruin my life. Today it rlly hit me that if i don't change I lose everything. I just don't know how, I don't know where this comes from let alone how to fix it.

I'm even struggling to talk to my boyfriend and he's the only person I really trust. He brought it up multiple times that I don't talk much, not even to him and started questioning if I trust him or if he scares me or wtf is wrong with me. I never told him why I used to self harm even though he asked, I just can't get the words out no matter how much I want to, and we've been together for quite a while now.

Then I started this new job I really like, until now I only did two days as a try out, but it's in hospitality so I have to talk to lots of customers which I find rlly hard. Today the boss sent a message saying that they they like how I work and everything, and that they would've already hired me didn't I have this problem with speaking. They offered I come back for a last tryout on friday and if they see me at least trying and see that there's something we can work on they'll take me and otherwise they won't. I'm considering just not going because what's the point if I'll just mess it up anyway. Better save myself the embarrassment. 

I just feel like I'm not good for anything, every part of my life is going to shit because of this and I've tried so hard to fix it, I worked a whole year in customer service before this, at first that was hard too but I just got used to saying the same phrases over and over again and putting myself out there. I thought maybe this means at this new job I won't have to start from zero again, but I do and this time I don't think they'll give me the time I need to get back into the mindset I had working at the other job.

"This might be a problem that will take some time to work out with a professional. I'll mention two books that can help. Handbook of Self-Help Therapies, which reviews studies of books and programs, says that the writings of Barbara Markway help people with moderate social anxiety. Her most recent book is Painfully Shy. How to Win Friends and Influence People has been a best seller for generations.  
  
  
Someone here has said that two things were very helpful for her social anxiety - a sport, playing on a high school team, and working at a place that gave her detailed instructions for dealing with customers. The second thing reminds me of a resource businesses often recommend for their sales people - How to Win Friends and Influence People  
  
  
Slow breathing can help with awkward social situations and phobias. You can get good and relaxed, then imagine yourself in a situation that makes you nervous.  Doctors recommend a simple exercise - breathe gently through the nose, 6 sec inhale and 6 sec exhale.  
You can also slow your breathing just before and during a conversation.  
  
  
There is some evidence that mindfulness helps. Apps like Headspace are very popular. Mindful Life Project is easy to use and free.

A good habit - always respond to a stressful moment by breathing slowly.   
  
When you’re calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say that 10 minutes of slow breathing is good. The exercise they recommend is breathing gently through the nose, 6 seconds in and 6 seconds out.   
   
When you’re worried, think calmly about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
  
The right kind of stress is good for us. With no stress at all, we're bored, and boredom is unhealthy. But prolonged high stress causes depression and other illnesses.

"Sorry to hear that, I have been struggling in life as well, but not as much as you. I would say please read and listen about Stoicism. Its an ancient philosophy which helps to get inner peace. The main ideology is that most things are out of our control and we should only focus on things that we can change and control. Also we should embrace whatever happens and proceed forward, remember we only live once.

Like in your case, your SO might leave, something which you cannot control, best you can do is work on your relationship but in the end you cannot control what she decides to do. Same with your father and so on.

so i went on my first date ever in my life, i’m 17 and it was a new experience for me. i told him i didn’t want to do anything on the first date but as we were swimming he touched my crotch and butt without asking and acted like it was a joke. i was uncomfortable but thought i was just overreacting. later on he touched my thighs and crotch area and then he asked me if it was okay and i said yes bc i didn’t wanna make him upset but i keep thinking about the fact he just touched me without asking at all at the pool. i guess i feel violated and i’m so sad it was my first time being touched. is this normal? am i just overthinking? i’m just really sad, he also used me as a rebound so i might just be overreacting.	throw49090	post	32.25472873055698	female	White	0.9989101886749268	na	na	na	2	MentalHealth
No, hun, it's not normal, and you are not overreacting in the slightest. What he did was sexual assault. Rebound or not, it should have never happened, especially after making it clear to him that you didn't want to do anything like that. I'm so sorry that happened, and that had to be your first experience. If you have a trusted adult, make sure you tell them and make them aware of what happened to you.	throw49090	reply	na	na	na	0.9989101886749268	strong	no	no	na	MentalHealth
"You are upset because your personal boundaries were crossed. While how you respond: yelling, cursing, being overly rude, could be considered a form of overreacting, you are not overreacting about the situation in general. It doesn't sound like you overreacted at all, in my opinion. 

Instead, you chose ""to keep the peace,"" so to speak, which has only resulted in disrupting your own personal inner peace. You need to ask yourself a couple of things here. 

1.) Do you feel violated? Yes? Then, cut contact immediately. Never EVER count feeling unsafe as overreacting. That's how abusers want you to feel, so you will continue to give them access. 
2.) Do you feel safe expressing your concerns with him? No? Again, cut contact immediately.
3.) After that interaction, do you really want to even see him again?  
4.) Even if he apologized and it turned out to be a ""big misunderstanding,"" can you forgive/forget how he made you feel without holding resentment? 

Personally, if he was willing to cross your boundaries once, he'll do it many times over. I would simply and politely tell him that this relationship isn't for you and stop seeing him. You can and should tell him exactly why you don't want to see him anymore, but if you feel unsafe, keep it as simple and amicable as possible. 

At the end of the day, you owe him nothing, not even an in-depth explanation. Say no thank you, not for me, and move on."	throw49090	reply	na	na	na	0.9989101886749268	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealth

"im completely undiagnosed, but im 99% sure i have severe depression and some form of anxiety. some neurodivergent friends say im likely neurodivergent too but ive brushed it off as depression and coping mechanisms

im tired constantly now, i have a week of exams starting tomorrow and i havent done any schoolwork for the past week and a half. only drew in my book and put my head on the desk. i dont even have the energy to play video games anymore, which was the one thing keeping me motivated along with music (quite literally the thing that saved my life). ive been depressed for the past 6 yrs but this is the worst its ever been. i had to cancel my gp appointment ive been asking to get for 4 yrs because it fell on the same day as my drama exam and i feel so defeated. 

even my future career is impossible, ive always wanted to go in the army but im way too mentally unstable to be allowed in. my house is a complete shithole (parent doesnt have the energy to do the washing up and is asleep or throwing up most of the day and sibling is out of the house 90% of the time). if im at my dad's im just getting nagged or talked at. since i confessed to him how awful ive felt the past 6 yrs ive been treated like a baby and im sick of it. 

i turned 15 just 3 weeks ago. i attempted 4 days after that. 2 attempts before at 14 and 13 and asks for help at 10, 13 and 14. only now has anyone bothered because i told them i actually attempted. nobody cares anymore. i dont even get asked to do my work if im zoned out/have my head on my desk or even directly asked if im okay. theyre acting like its normal to feel this way. 1 teacher asked my friend and then never spoke to me about it. 

sorry for the kind of long vent. im just so tired all the time. it doesnt feel like its ever going to get better. the only person whos shown to care is my pastoral manager but she has 200 other kids to take care of and ive only spoken to her once. im trying to clean my room to be able to get a pc and decorate it the way i want, but i had to take a break and its already impossible to see the floor.

"I’m sorry you’re dealing with an unsupportive family who doesn’t seem to listen to you or value you. I promise that all the families you see who seem so great also have issues of their own, just different than the ones you are experiencing. No one is perfect, even families that seem that way.

I think a therapist would tell you that it’s really great that you can identify specifically what kind of support you want and need to thrive in your mental health (being heard, understood and appreciated, and someone to celebrate your accomplishments with). Knowing what you need is half the battle. The second half of the battle is finding how to get what you need from people who care about you- that might be your family, or your chosen family, or close friends who do support you. Who can you think of in your life who celebrates your accomplishments with you and listens to you? Can you share with them what you’re struggling with?

Sometimes you have to explicitly ask for what you need from people emotionally, even though it seems like they should just provide it automatically. I know it sucks, and it’s hard to have those conversations, but it can be worth it in the long run. They might not even realize they are treating you poorly- they might just be so absorbed in their own lives and issues. Which also sucks to be ignored like that.

"Does anyone else have something of this nature? I originally was diagnosed with GAD, now OCD. My current therapist seems to have no idea how to handle this other than to “redirect attention”. Which I agree, but it’s impossible when my brain is constantly at every minute of the day attaching negative thoughts to my regular stream of consciousness. I can handle some, maybe more than half - but it’s literally every thought. 

Basically every thought I have comes with some sort of shitty intrusive retort. I could have a thought while playing basketball “nice shot” and then a second voice in my head immediately shoots it down with “what was the point of that, that was stupid, you better focus, but on what? What should you focus on in your shot? You suck.”

Repeat x1000 in every different scenario

This is coupled with intrusive images and rumination which makes a great time.

I used to be able to allow this stuff just to be there, but it was quieter. I was on Prozac but it pooped out and when I upped the dosage my brain went into turbo drive and I had a breakdown/felt very near to having a psychotic episode 6 weeks in. Perhaps had I powered through it would have evened me out eventually.

"I have a couple of ideas you can talk about with your therapist. Dialectical Behavior Therapy, the best treatment for BPD, recommends distress tolerance and radical acceptance. It has a variety of simple things like slow breathing for moments of stress. Slow  breathing is especially good because it's so simple and you can use it anytime.  
  
DBT points out that acceptance is not liking something but rather learning to live with something that won't go away, at least not for a while.  
  
An example of radical acceptance is someone with high anxiety considering what the feeling is and deciding that it's not all that bad. Fear makes the heart beat fast, but so does running.  
  
Maybe the problem is magnification - making the negative thought seem like something worse than it is. Then you could say to it something like ""OK, but don't bother me now - I'm busy"" instead of getting upset about it."	spiroagneww	reply	na	na	na	0.9985674619674683	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth

I (20F) feel like I don't deserve anything I own along with not feeling worthy of living. I've had this feeling since I was a kid, it started when I was around 10 but it got much worse as I got older. It started because of my parents, I wasn't planned nor desired, my parents hate each other but stay together for convenience and I believe my mom wanted to strap my dad, based on how she is. They always said that I was ungrateful, that there's kids out there with much less than me and I didn't value what I had. I was never a bad kid, I did pretty typical kids stuff and generally was well behaved. These types of talks just got more common as I got older and it got to the point where I started to sleep on the floor and eat as little as possible. Sadly it's still affecting me to this day when I get gifts or when I buy something for myself with my own money. I don't know how to solve this, is this normal? Do people go through this?

I don’t see any difference other than sleeping a little easier at night when taking the oil but I’m not sure if it’s just because I’ve been really stressed throughout the day I have been exhausted by night time and that’s why I’ve been able to sleep, I’m not sure.

"I want to start by asking what your desired effect is overall?

I haven't done the drops only the gummy and vape versions of cannabinoid products so I can attest to those and I've never heard of either brand that you've mentioned so again I'm not completely familiar. 

Anyway, the most important thing is what you're wanting out of it which will help you better decide which products to get. 

Usually a full spectrum hemp derived product is good for pain, stress, relaxation, sleep and all that. If it has CBN, CBD, CBG, and some others alongside Delta 9 then you're looking at a decent amount of pain relief and a high that can be intense if you take too much. 

I take a quarter of a gummy (15mg) and wait about an hour to see any results. This helps you gauge just what dosage does what and if you need to increase, which obviously you can do incrementally. 

It sounds like the product you have isn't doing what you need it to do so I would suggest maybe doing the 3 drops, waiting for about 20 minutes and if no results just increase by 1 or 2 in about the same time span to see how it effects you over time and continuing this until you notice something.. If nothing else I would recommend just getting a different product altogether and one with the full spectrum cannabinoids"	Rachelmcguire7	reply	na	na	na	0.9937564134597778	no	no	strong	na	MentalHealth
Hi, I know that having depression and anxiety makes us very vulnerable emotionally but how do you handle stressful situations?	michaf213	post	61.80853542514551	female	White	0.0019047100795432925	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
"First thing I do is I do my best to calm my heart by breathing:
in-out-in-out-in-out... until I feel a steady, healthy beating :) I focus solely on breathing, there is nothing else outside of that.

It usually clears the air and focus your brain ;) A very potent tip if you need to calm down ;)

But aside from that, people have a remarkable ability to adapt. That means the more you experience something, the more accustomed you are to its exposure and more resilient you become. There is no easy fix for feeling stressed, all of us feel it at some points. What we can do is to have faith that with every new experience we get a little more stronger :) And have knowledge that because we've survived previous exposures, we are absolutely able to survive that new one ;) It's all in our power ;)"	michaf213	reply	na	na	na	0.0019047100795432925	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealth
"(21F) I’ve been dating my partner (23M) for almost 3 years now. For some reason, I’ve been noticing that when he’s not around me for long periods of time, around night time, I tend to spam my social media and my mind races a lot more than when I’m next to him. 

It gets to a point where I know that I’m going to act that way. For example: last night my partner left after I got home from work for 4-5 hours. I decide to spam / over share on my Instagram story (nothing pertaining to him or inappropriate, more so like trauma dump from my childhood) , and I think it’s funny stuff but I also feel embarrassed due to how much I spam and my friends can usually tell. So I tried to play games instead or exercise. I never have this energy when he’s with me. 

I don’t know if I’m thinking too hard or looking to close at the things I do but I really don’t think it’s “normal”. I’ve had this discussion with a past therapist but I don’t understand why. He’s going to be gone for a couple of days out of town, and I can tell that I’m going to be completely unbearable. Usually I just turn my phone off. 

Is this easily explainable?"	Psyched3lix	post	24.37761088632354	male	White	0.9903188943862915	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
Well, idk how you will take this, but you probably have a problem with attention / validation seeking. When he's there, he is giving you attention. When he is not there, you try to fill these gaps elsewhere. You probably have a deep fear of being abandoned, or that you're not good enough, self esteem issues. Im not a therapist thouhgh. What did your therapist say? It's probably best to listen to him.	Psyched3lix	reply	na	na	na	0.9903188943862915	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth
"idek how to write this without appearing like i have a superiority complex. So first of all, i always tend to think that my music, fashion, and overall lifestyle taste is objectively better than the majority of people. Its not like i have a blanket statement like jazz>>>>>pop music or anything. I listen to almost every genre, but not every songs of it, I have a profound feeling to judge whether its a good song or not, and because of this i tend to feel that the majority of people have really boring or bad tastes in music. Subsequently making me feel better than everyone else. Im just scared that this could evolve into something more problematic lol.

"I'm a 17F and I'm constantly thinking of killing myself. The main issues, I think, are my smoking addiction and weight. I'm so fat and miserable. I dated this guy online and I fell in love with him. When he asked to meet up, I got so scared that I just broke up with him. I'm terrified that he'll think I'm ugly and hideous.

I'm always so miserable and I feel empty 24/7. I don't even wanna hang out with my close friends anymore. When I walk with them side by side, my hips end up bumping them and almost knock them over sometimes. I hate myself.

I've tried dieting and regular exercise but my body feels so exhausted due to my busy schedule. I can't continue them for long.

Life is always going to be hard but it is never going to stay the same for long periods of time—give your life a chance to change!! 

As for the weight thing—it’s not your fault that society tells fat women to hate themselves!! Fat women are so beautiful and it’s a lie that you are ugly or worthless because you’re fat. Try focusing on what you feel like/what your body can do rather than what it looks like. Aim for body neutrality and focus on feeling good, and eventually you’ll develop confidence.

"Caveat: I'm a 40M that has CPTSD, constant anxiety I can't turn off, and major depressive disorder. I'm also a military veteran.
  
OP life can be quite exhausting going about the humdrum of wake, eat, and sleep. I constantly have negative thoughts about unaliving myself about 20 times a day. I don't really like to tell people about the true extent of my mental health... because people are judgy idiots sometimes due to their ignorance. 
  
I digress, f^ck what other people think or might think about you. People will always be jerks. There is an important thing about unaliving oneself that doesn't enter our minds during that state. There are people that care about you and love you without you knowing at times. When someone commits suicide, that grief will spread like wildfire to the people that care about you.
  
Those people that care about you may not tell you or show you. It's possible they are dealing with their own demons but they have that love for you still.
  
Do not give up. Find something that gives you purpose and I'm not just talking about religion.
  
My reason to endure and survive the suffering in my head... I want to outlive my enemies and dance on their graves.

Keep your head up kid. Your weight will fluctuate ad you get older. I've dealt with obesity my entire life.

I won't bore you with the extent of my life story, but don't unalive yourself. Try therapy, medication, and just go for a walk... whether it's for 1 minute or 1 hour.

Looking back at every trauma and hardship I went through as a child until now (I’m 32) I’ve learned over the years it’s what made me who I am today. At 17 you’re still learning yourself and the world. But child, once you learn to love yourself and appreciate what the world has to offer, you’ll truly open your eyes. You don’t need anyone to tell you how to act, how to look, and how to be. And as you continue to grow up, the people around you will change. The only person who will always be there for you is you. You ARE beautiful. Don’t let anyone tell you, you aren’t.

We have to realize every being suffers no matter what. Even the best of us.

Caring about every cell in your body and understanding it's a beautiful powerful thing no matter how old or sick we get, it houses us and allows us to feel

Our feelings and emotions are our best allies in navigating this world but going with the flow of society generally pushes us away from them and encourages us to cope in unhealthy ways through expensive vices that are often detrimental to our state of being

You are already worthy of your own love.. accepting where we are with ourselves is important because it allows us to know ourselves better, understand the how and the why we are worthy of it, to move forward without leaving anything behind

I called it branching out, take a topic and find similar topics that relate to it, or just start a new one! 

Another thing would be to practice cognitive empathy, anyone can develop that! Just think about what the person said, and imagine how you feel in their shoes, even if you can't feel what they're feeling you can think how you'd feel.

Try to improve your attractiveness. You could improve your body through weight lifting, improve your facial attractiveness through skincare and a low body fat percentage, and you could improve your hair through developing a styling routine. I’m not sure what you look like, but any man can improve his looks by 3-4 points if he just puts in the work. There’s no easy solution or piece of advice that anyone can give you to fix this problem, you just have to become the type of guy women want to hug and be around.

"You should try to find things to do outside of your house so you can have something else to focus on your life instead of just your weight.

\- Our **Activities affect our self esteem**: It's important to have different areas in your life that make you feel happy, not be emotionally dependant on one area (for example physique)  
  
\+ Exercise / Sports  
  
\+ Hobbies (I love your drawing!)  
  
\+ Friends / Relationship/ Family  
  
\+ Working or Studying  
  
\+ Learning a new skill, finding something else you like , 

\+ Starting a New Project, etc.  
  
The key is to realize that you are good the way you are and that you don't need to change or listen to what your toxic parents say about your body or your identity.  
  
\- **Our Thoughts affect our mood**: What we think is what we feel, if you spend all day thinking bad things about yourself then you will feel bad. Thinking that your friend don't like you because you are flawed and that nobody will love you then you will feel bad all day.  
  
Taking the blame for everything and thinking negatively about yourself is the equivalent of eating rotten fruit: ***It doesn't matter who is selling that to, don't eat it!***  
  
All those thoughts that you have, you gotta ask yourself:  
  
**Are they actually true?**  
  
**How useful are them?**  
  
If you assume something as true without questioning it, you will let this very toxic thoughts ruin your mood daily. This internal dialogue, even if in some situation is true, is not useful, and consuming that daily will make your mood worse.

For example, ""I don't deserve to eat, I'm useless, I only cause problems, My parents don't love me, All my life will suck""

\> **You deserve to eat**, what you don't deserve is constant yelling, bullying and punishment from your abusive parents.

\> **You are not useless**, you are just in a place were your capabilities aren't used. Just because you make a mistake doesn't mean you are useless: It happens because you are in an enviroment that is pressuring you, and this is why mistakes happen.

\> **You cause problems?...** Everytime an accident happens it's your mother who is yelling, and in any argument it's your father who is illogical and trying to physically beat you. ^(If anything you are the least problematic there!)

"Don't push yourself to eat if you don't want to. Just know you are valid for feeling bad. People can suck sometimes. All I want you to do is not put yourself in a position of more hurt after the have already hurt you. 

Your feelings are real, and even though they may be really powerful. Just know you own them. Don't let them own you and what you want to do.

Now I also don't want to come off as validating you for starving yourself - at the same time I do want you to feel like you have a sense of control over yourself. It's starts with processing those hard emotions first. You can look it from your current lense of negativity as a pseudo punishment. When in reality you are helping yourself regain control.

I know. Or maybe I don't I never has an eating disorder, I just had undiagnosed adhd as a kid and never really ate because my mom's food sucked and I'd have to ration canned food. I also just plain forgot to eat. What you are going through is different but I do at least empathize with being mocked and made fun of for being ""too skinny.""

Take care of yourself. Feed yourself when you are ready. You do have to face your feelings even if they hurt and not try to get away from them. Give yourself a break you matter. <3"	httpxelysian_7	reply	na	na	na	0.9989155530929565	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealth

"Been going through something similar with my family, and understanding that your parents don't know any better than you, are no better than you, and do not own your life is a part of feeling better.

Nobody is worthy of anything more than anyone else. It doesn't matter if one is a hard worker, lazy, confused, or a hero / villain. By making a statement like ""I don't deserve to eat,"" you are making a statement that there ARE people who are worthy. 

Is Elon Musk more worthy of breakfast than that child starving in Africa because he's rich? Are your parents more worthy of lunch than a 91 year old grandma who spends all day sleeping in her rocking chair because that grandma isn't ""contributing to society anymore"" or is less ""physically fit?"" Think about it a little bit, then apply that logic to yourself. I think you'll find that the concept of ""deserving something"" does not apply to real life (even though many people will foolishly argue otherwise)."	httpxelysian_7	reply	na	na	na	0.9989155530929565	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealth
"That makes sense to me.  I try to limit my thoughts. I try to break them into smaller parts.  

If I were to translate what you say into what I experienced, this is what I would say to myself.

I was depressed.  Then I moved into my parents house.  As a result my mental attitude got worse.

Because my parents did not understand why I was depressed or were not sensitive to how vulnerable I was, they said things that hurt me.  

As a result of what they said, I decided to change eating habits.  I decided I was going to agree with them them and harm myself.  I can control that.  Like you said at the end, I should have never existed, I hate my life.

I have had suicidal thoughts all my life.  I also get severe depressions too.  Literally, I hate being alive.  So when things get really bad, sh is my go to reaction.  

For you, what you did and said is how you reacted.  There is no why, no explanation. No one is right or wrong.  

So ultimately you have to take action or not take action.

I had a complete breakdown, was not expected to recover.  Something someone said to me helped me.  In the midst of my despair, they laughed at me because of they way I was thinking and acting.  Then they said it “What are you going to do about it?”

It hit me hard.  I realized it was my problem.   I had to take responsibility to fix it.  No one cared, no one helped me.  I wanted to be like other people.

It took me 3.5 years to stabilize.  I also had to recover from a drug addiction, alcoholism and suicidal thoughts.  I did too.  

I do not believe in sympathy.  I do believe in empathy.  I have experienced similar issues.  Other people too.

The sad thing is that you have to fix it.  Somehow in your despair, you need to find a hook that can pull you out."	httpxelysian_7	reply	na	na	na	0.9989155530929565	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealth

Gaining weight is healthy, unless to an excessive amount. If your weight is normal, then that's perfect! But if you feel bad about it, you can try a more balanced meal instead of starving. Also, it's impossible to satisfy everyone. Their being mad is their problem, not yours. You are not useless, and you deserve to love yourself. Don't force yourself to eat too much; just eat something that has the nutrients and vitamins you need. Take it one step at a time. I know it's hard, but you've got this!

"OP, not eating anything at all is rly bad idea. I know Its caused by your mental state but it will damage your body severely. Eat at least vegetables and meat + fruits. These are healthy and won't gain you much weight.

I also had some depressive sad episodes and bcs of being sad, didn't eat much. I always delayed eating lunch for example for 2 hours and when I woke up I didn't have breakfast, but then I became hungry which would make me feel even worse so I just ate regularly. I just ate a bit less than usual so I kinda understand. If i didn't eat at all I would be sick and know it would be really unhealthy for me.

The problem is not the game, it's the behaviour of your siblings. Your parent's responsibility. Have you talked to them? When we were kids we each got an hour of gaming and then we switched. We set a timer, so no one could cheat. It was fair, so the bickering stopped. Maybe try to come up with something like that?

I was put on psych meds at age 11/12. I don't feel like I was given a chance to work through all my issues. By that age I had attempted and was running wild, i will admit. I also will say I had been in therapy since I was 5. This being said, more traumatic events kept continuously happening and that's what I honestly blame for my lack of improvement in those years. Two addict parents with mental issues and a sexually abusive brother makes for quite the upbringing. I am 17 now, off my meds, still going to therapy and I can confidently say for me I'm doing better without them. I feel like I made improvement once I moved out of my mom's house and started to really focus on the traumas I felt were affecting me the most. I will also say some people genuinely need meds.

"It started on my birthday for some reason.

I just woke up and felt like not doing anything, I laid in bed all day and didn't eat anything all day. 24+ hours without food or water. My Dad asked what was wrong with me, he criticized me for how I spent my ""Sweet 16"".

&#x200B;

Its been 2 weeks since then and I'm still dealing with whatever this is. I'll get to the point and list some symptoms I've had.

\- I'll sleep all day after struggling to fall asleep at night, and even though I get plenty of rest during the day I feel exhausted and tired. Where I did have these days every now and then before, recently its every day.

\-I'm just not hungry at times. I'll go all day without eating at times. It's not because I don't want to eat, or I'm starving myself, I just have no appetite.

\-I'm in a constant mood. I feel angry towards others for no reason, and can't even bring myself to talk to anyone.

\-I can't cry. This has been going on for a long time, a year or two maybe. I just can't cry, it's like whenever I come close it feels like it sinks back down and I can never get anything out. And I feel sad all the time. I'm unhappy with where I am in life with friends and a lot of other things. I'm terrible socially. This isn't to say I don't have friends, in person I'm pretty outgoing and have a lot of friends at school, both popular and unpopular, all across the board. I make people laugh and seem like I'm extroverted (I've gotten that a lot) but I'm dying inside with each conversation. I always think back and cringe at it, and recently it's just boiling over and I keep being self critical about my lack of partners and failure to hang out with anyone outside of school.

\-I have this extreme lack of motivation. In the past 2 years I've been pumping iron. I started because of my school football program, but kept with it. I bought equipment and made a lot of progress, especially with my upperbody. Of course eventually I got body dysmorphia and picked out every little thing about my physique, and I didn't realize how big I got until I lost it. And I lost it pretty quickly. This was another one of the first things that started when leading up to when shit hit the fan. I couldn't get out of bed. I had no motivation to get in the gym, or even move from my bed for hours. I had no motivation to study for school, practice driving, or do anything. Even when I was at the beach I just couldn't get up to actually go outside. In fact, I used to keep my room very neat and clean, but now I can't even be bothered to make the bed.

\-At times I will feel numb. No emotions. A good example was when my Mom was crying, saying she just wanted her son back. I couldn't say anything or feel anything, not sadness or pity, just nothing. It never hit me until later when I was alone and it hurt so much, but I couldn't even cry. But that's just one example, there are plenty of other times where I just feel nothing, I feel at times like I could die right now and feel no fear, feel nothing, like nothing matters at all.

\-I have this weird thing, where when I'm thinking about what I've done and what I'm doing and all the things, especially when I try to put what I'm dealing with into words, I just shut down. I get this strange feeling where I just give up and feel like I can't do it and can't do anything. I've written this post hundreds of times and have deleted it and given up because of this and because I feel no one would care. I'd just be another post in thousands.

\-Ive become very self critical. I think about the things I've done, my accomplishments, hobbies, and skills. And then I realize I have none. No hobbies, I've never done anything cool or extraordinary, I can't do anything right. I'm terrible at everything I try, football? I'd get rocked every practice and broke bones? I wanna become a lifeguard? Too bad I suck at swimming and I'm so weak now I can't do anything physical until I start eating right again but that's easier said than done when you can't even get out of bed. The more I think about what I should be doing and what I've actually done, I just feel hopeless. I know I shouldn't compare myself to others or set ""perfect"" standards for myself, but thats easier said than done, again.

\-My confidence has tanked. I can't even do voice chat without thinking I sound like an idiot, or shake someone's hand without worrying I seem weak. I've always been an anxious person, barely keeping it together at test dates and social gathers, sports practices and what not. I'd feel so nervous, like my heart was gonna explode and all I wanted to do was crawl into bed and just stop existing, but outwards I'd be fine, I'd get shit done. But nowadays I am crawling into bed, and for a lot of people I stop existing, some of my own family members will go days without seeing me.

That's all I can think of right now, It's taking a lot of effort and brain power to think about all the stuff right now. Like I said before I'd have episodes like this before, usually on the weekends or on breaks from school, but usually it's only a day or two, and now it's everyday. Keep in mind it is summer break, so I've got nothing to distract me from how I'm feeling like when I have school to worry about and hell even then its not easy with all the pressure and stress and pain and worry, It feels like I can never really relax during summer like I used to be able to.

This might be unrelated to all of this, but a few weeks ago on April 1st, I know it sounds like a joke because April fools but I really wish it was, I was blackmailed by a man who forced me to do stuff. He had pictures of me that I sent him and when I tried to ghost him to get away he said I'd either meet up with him or he'd expose me. I was 15 at the time, even where I live its statutory rape. I tried to like it, I tried to look on the bright side while he did things to me and made me do things, but after it was done I just felt disgusting and ashamed that I actually did it, and that at times I liked it. I feel disgusted in myself just writing that. He's still out there, he gave me a sex toy that I still have. Part of me wants to expose him, I know what he looks like he's hispanic, overweight (he said 220 pounds), and hes a real son of a bitch. He wanted to keep doing it but I told him how it made me feel, he just laughed at me. I blocked him soon after and so far I'm in the clear. This event has given me so much anxiety, what if I got an STD from him, he used no protection and finished inside. It's been over a month and still nothing, but I know things like AIDS can go years without showing symptoms, and I can't exactly get tested for STDs without my parents knowing, so I don't wanna kiss or have sex with any girls my age until I know I'm in the clear, because the last thing I wanna do is spread this POS's filth to anyone else. My parents would be ashamed of me if I told them, I know my Mom might be more focused on helping, but I don't know about my Dad. His default reaction to everything is anger, he has anger issues. There are times where he gets so mad that he'll slam doors so hard frames on adjacent walls break, and his eyes are bloodshot like Omni-Man from Invincible lol. But he'd never hurt me or my family, he's a good man and does his best for my family, and I love him. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, I'm wondering if the sudden influx of anxiety from this event has caused this stuff to boil over, because I've been experiencing these symptoms for years now, but never this bad. 

I think that's all I've got to say now, if anyone would be kind enough to give me some advice. I've tried going to a therapist before but I just can't talk to them. I don't feel comfortable. If it's what must be done I'll do it. But about the blackmail guy, If I told them wouldn't they have to notify my parents and even the police? It's all so terrible. So what's going on with me if anyone has any guesses.

&#x200B;

"This is a lot to go through alone. Please if you can find a female therapist to talk to or show them this post if you cant talk at the time. Nobody deserves to take advantage of you or your body. That was a horrible thing that man did. The amount of emotions you are experiencing are too much, please see a counsellor as soon as you can. You are not alone, unfortunately too many young girls go through what you've mentioned.

"I am a very sensitive person, always have been. I cry very easily, when I get in arguments or have to confront someone or am yelled at or watch sad movies or sometimes I even cry for no apparent reason. Everyone knows this about me and I know how to deal with it.

But there's one thing that, no matter how much I want to and no matter how much it should make me cry, just doesn't make me cry. Three years ago I lost my best friend. She killed herself in the school bathroom. It was the worst and lowest time of my life, I miss her more than anything and yet I did not cry when I found out. I physically couldn't. The days after it happened didn't feel real and even though it's been a long time since, sometimes it's still hard to accept.

Today I told a friend about what had happened, and he accused me of lying about it because how is it I cry about the smallest things but can't cry when I tell people about her. It does make me incredibly sad and for the longest time I felt guilty about her death. I used to think it was my fault, I started punishing myself. I self harmed, cut all my friends off and stopped eating. 

I feel like screaming and crying and feeling all of this pain. But I can't cry. A little like when you need to sneeze but you can't, just that it doesn't go away until I focus my thoughts on something else.

Reading what you wrote, I can tell you miss your friend terribly and you feel real grief. The lack of tears doesn’t mean you didn’t care or that she wasn’t important. And maybe you are feeling so much guilt over your reaction that you haven’t been able to properly process that grief. 

I’m guessing that maybe there is part of you that is also experiencing anger that she took her own life. There is a great organization called Project Semicolon that helps with those left behind after a suicide. I’d recommend you check them out and see what resources they have available.

That's a completely normal response. I cry so much especially when I was younger it was daily multiple times a day. And when my father died then even at his funeral I didn't cry at all. I had a feeling that night he died and balled my eyes out but after I was told and knew he was gone I almost never cried about it. It was very painful and definitely changed me as a person on a fundamental level but just cause I couldn't cry didn't mean I wasn't in a lot of pain. After processing for years I'm able to cry and u dont cry much more about it because it's been so long and I was in 6th grade but it still hurts. It's a normal response to shocking information I still struggle with not being able to cry when certain horrible things happen. It takes time to process can even take many years it took me years to be able to genuinely cry about losing him.	zukosbikini	reply	na	na	na	0.9933759570121765	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealth

I tried applying once last year tho but couldn't find the courage again, the last years job application was from a friend whom I'm very comfortable with. All of my friends have moved on to a new company and I'm left here alone. The workplace I am at is so chaotic that nothing is predictable well getting worser is.
Tho some factors like it's me the bread winner of the fam and I'm quite anxious if i moved to a new company they may fire me coz of my attention span and crazy perception of deadline. The current workplace is work from home basically I control my time here I mean you know I can procrastinate way too long before I do anything which i find quite nice. What i do is do some task in the last minute or adjust my working hour to a time where i got laser focus (usually i extend hours it's not paid tbh just to finish the task at hand, what i mean is usually when i procrastinate I tend to do nothing when clocked in, the moment the end of business day is atm is when I'm motivated so i extend my working hour to accommodate task i procrastinated with earlier) I'm quite comfortable tbh my boss doesnt care much i mean he tells me deadline is Tuesday I'll do the thing Tuesday even at 11pm whereas I'm just on 8-4 schedule. 
What I'm afraid at is when i move to a new place of work I cant do this setup coz of the ff reasons 
1. Different boss 
2. They are mindful of work hours 
3.  I can't procrastinate task to a time where i got laser focus. 
4. Losing work from home privileged due most workplace is in the office nowadays.
5. They'll discover i have shitty work habit and fire me.
6. I don't wanna tell them mental issues coz it might affect future job prospects.

My friends are mad at me staying at a toxic workplace i kept falling them on looking for other workplace i dunno what to do if i lose them. They are right some workplace got better pay and more peaceful setup if i am lucky to be there. It's just that I'm stuck the moment i looked at LinkedIn i get so overwhelmed i have updated my CV it's just that it gets so overwhelming that sometimes i just sit there staring blankly at the monitor.

I dont know what am doing with my life. Any tips or insights or story you could share would mean the world to me. Thank you in advance"	ponpatapon420	post	26.638983864819913	male	White	0.998874843120575	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth

"My advice is to start small with your goals and to reward yourself everytime you meet the small goals. Showering - dry shampoo helps. If you can’t manage to get in the shower maybe get some music going or start with wet wipes or washing sweaty bits in the sink first. 

Food - give yourself a break and get pre-made things. Ready chopped fruit/veggies. If you’re under eating - protein shakes are great way to get a meal in for cheap and quick."	donkeytadano	reply	na	na	na	0.9985930323600769	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth

I've cut off my family, dumped my boyfriend, and cut off a lot of friends. All I have is my cat, my sisters, and my grandma and thats all I need. Humans are a tiring chore, I'm done with them. Only person I truly love is myself now, I'm done trying to be the person they want, I know what I want. I've stopped cutting myself, I've stopped have suicidal thoughts, my arm isn't covered in blood when I sleep anymore because I fed into my anger. I don't need anyone and I never well. I've let go of my morals and trying to be nice, it's never worked. I'm gonna do what I want and what makes me happy and I'm finally gonna love myself. Fuck everyone else.

I was so scared that my throat just stopped working and all I could say was that I’ve been really struggling mentally. But that was enough to get the ball rolling. I told her a little about my situation, she decided to prescribe me Antidepressants after doing an ECG and she told me to make an appointment at the counselling centre of my university. She gave me her phone number and specifically told me to call if i need something even when she is on holidays. I will see her again next week.

The conversation didn’t go perfectly, especially since I didn’t know that doctor and she didn’t know me. But I felt seen and now I’m not helpless anymore.

"If you can't see a therapist, self-help is better than nothing. A lot of people benefit from it. Self-help is a way to show you're serious that doesn't create friction in the family. In fact, it wouldn't be surprising if your parents liked some healthy changes in your behavior.  
  
  
Self-help can be educational for parents as well as kids. A good self-help book explains what therapy for depression is like.  
  
  
With depression, there's what seems like a Catch 22. People say, ""I know there are things that will make me feel better - getting exercise, taking care of myself, straightening up the house and cleaning, but I'm depressed and I don't have the energy.  
  
  
Here's the thing - very important. People do have energy when they're depressed - as much energy as they always do, but for some reason, the system is reluctant to let you use your energy.  
  
  
We have to use psychology to coax energy out of our systems. Psychology has some nifty tricks.  
  
  
A famous psychiatrist, Abraham Low, said that when we can't control our feelings we can still control our muscles. If you tell your arms and legs to get you out of bed or to the bathroom for a shower, they will obey.  
  
  
Try this when it seems that you're too tired to work. Lie on the couch, close your eyes, and get ready to work by imagining yourself working for 5 minutes.  
  
  
This is a motivation trick that's been used in behavior modification programs since the 1930s. If a task seems like it's too big, think of it as a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time, and start with something really, really easy. Cleaning - start by cleaning for 3 or 4 min and take a 5 min break. Homework - start by proofreading a paper or previewing a chapter you're going to read by looking at headings, sub-headings, etc.  
  
  
You don't have to be an athlete to benefit from exercise. As little as 20 min brisk walking a day can help, and you can add to that gradually so long as you don't make yourself sick of exercise with too much and quit. Steve Ilardi, the therapist/researcher who headed the lifestyle-depression project at the Univ of Kansas, talks about enjoyable ways to get exercise.  
  
  
If you go to Metapsychology, you can read a psychologist's review of Dr Ilardi's book (""splendid"").  
  
  
Of all the traditional mind-body practices (meditation, etc.), the one with the best evidence for affecting mood disorders is yoga breathing. Slow breathing is used for treating anxiety, depression, panic disorder, and PTSD. It's safe and it doesn't take any training.  
  
  
Video, below - details about self-help based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and lifestyle choices that help with depression - nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise, and social support, also traditional Asian methods.  
  
  
It has advice specifically for depressed students, such as StudentsAgainstDepression.org.

You are right you are in a bad cycle.  Isolation and drinking is very bad one.
You have to take a small positive step into a better place, and then take another.
Either go to school or go to work or just spend time with another human and talk/connect.
Failing this get therapy and talk/connect with the therapist.  I’ve had 2 therapists over the last 10 years, I love them both, they were there every week talking and helping ME! It was enough for me to start getting better.
Please look after yourself, reduce the drinking to zero if u can, and connect with someone just one time a day.

So I (15f) feel terrible about myself. Most of the times I can clingy or want to talk to my friends all the time but I understand they and I have life. Sometimes i ask them if they are mad at me, they say no then I feel bad because I overreacted and overthink. I don’t feel good about my body or face too even tho people always compliment me on them. Like I went to the gym few days ago and my friends said I have some muscles at first I didn’t believe him and he also complimented me on how much weight I can pull. I don’t have a close relationship with my family either. I just don’t want to feel like this anymore.	Nice-Ad6110	post	26.04645010136027	female	White	0.999098539352417	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
"Hello  
  
It seems like your biggest issue is ***Emotional Dependency***: Basically your only source of happiness is people (friends/partners) instead of from multiple sources (hobby, learning something,etc).  
  
\- Our **Activities affect our self esteem**: It's important to have different areas in your life that make you feel happy, not be emotionally dependant on one area (for example a girlfriend)  
  
\+ Exercise / Sports  
  
\+ Hobbies *(I bet you don't have one!)*  
  
\+ Friends / Relationship/ Family  
  
\+ Working or Studying  
  
\+ Learning a new skill, finding something else you like , etc.  
  
The key is to not obsess over one area and spend all your resources there because your SELF ESTEEM will depend on that thing only *(relationships)* and you will feel empty, depressed and constantly insecure about your friendship.  
  
This emotional dependency is the reason why people are constantly worried about being liked, afraid of rejection and overthink every encounter with their friends/partners. You are trying too hard to be liked, try to like yourself!  
  
Your Anxiety can be caused by negative thoughts about yourself (self doubt, blaming, feeling inferior, ""sacrificing"" yourself for others, etc)  
  
\- Our **Thoughts affect our mood**: What we think is what we feel, if you spend all day thinking bad things about yourself then you will feel bad. Thinking that your friend don't like you because you are flawed and that nobody will love you then you will feel bad all day.  
  
Taking the blame for everything and thinking negatively about yourself is the equivalent of eating rotten fruit: *It doesn't matter who sold that to you in the past, the problem is that you are still eating it!*  
  
All those thoughts that you have, you gotta ask yourself:  
  
**Are they actually true?**  
  
**How useful are them?**  
  
If you assume something as true without questioning it, you will let this very toxic thoughts ruin your mood daily. This internal dialogue, even if in some situation is true, is not useful, and consuming that daily will make your mood worse.  
  
**You gotta question your thoughts, spread out your activities and work on yourself!**"	Nice-Ad6110	reply	na	na	na	0.999098539352417	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth

"Working with my therapist and wanted to just have an official diagnosis for my conditions so I know exactly where I am. Talked with a clinic and was told that if I want an official diagnosis for my PTSD, the testing would cost me $900 just for the tests. 

Even with insurance, they said I have to pay it upfront and if insurance covers it, they can request reimbursement.

And people wonder why mental health is so prevealant and hardly treated in this damn country. I honestly think parents would be less resistant to letting their kids get tested/treated if it wasnt so expensive.

I don't know in your case, but often it's not really necessary to get tested for something like that. They can usually prescribe meds without it, just based on the symptoms you experience.

"I’m sorry to hear you’ve had such negative experiences mental health practitioners. Being labeled as being possessed by a demon is way out of line. 

A few red flags are:
Dismissive or judgmental attitudes. 
Not paying attention or constantly interrupting.
Pressure to stick to certain principles or ideas.
Overstepping boundaries or inappropriate conduct. 
Promising quick fixes or results that are guaranteed.
Minimizing or ignoring your worries.

To find a good mental health regimen or expert I suggest first trusting your instinct (many time we know what we need or who will be a fit to support us but don’t trust ourselves enough), schedule consults to gauge the person’s responsiveness and empathy to your questions and concerns, research different approaches to get a feel for what resonates with you most to find a mental health practitioner who offers the specific approach.

But they know I don't want to work in this industry. Why don't they care that their idiot kid just wasted 10s of thousands of THEIR money on a career they won't even pursue?! My only chance is to go back to school, move provinces to do so to get into nursing, work my ass off for the pay and pay them back. But I don't know how I'm gonna do it. I can't take any more money from them. I won't. I can't even find any jobs where I am right now. I don't know if student assistance in my home province will cover me since I've been in a different province for the last year. I don't know how I'll afford my car, gas, living expenses, and tuition. I'm stressed. I don't want to do anything. I don't want to leave my bed. I'm overwhelmed. I don't even know *what* to do. I'm considering just offing myself and giving up.

"So, around 3 years ago I was diagnosed with OCD and was told I should give my OCD a name as it would help realise it as a bully and not as me.

So I did. And ended up making another 3 (4 (now 5 as I recently discovered another.) )

So anyways these people have names, ages, likes etc. 
they all live in my head, in a house. 

This wouldn’t be so bad but I’m worried it is becoming DID/MPD.
I allowed my friends to live in my head cause I was lonely, (all my friends at that time had left me randomly so I was friendless, I also had issues with my family at the time too.) and so as a result, I began to act like them as I wanted them more in my life.

Now, they have began almost without me knowing putting an influence on me.
Like when I’m one of them called “Eve” I feel a random boost of joy and want to act childish and dress in pink. I feel very feminine.

But if I feel like “Eyes” I suddenly am really smart and can answer stuff easily! So also feel very dark and like I’m a boy.

I don’t wanna say it’s DID. But my art therapist did bring up DID to me. I dismissed it because I don’t get amnesia.
I have started getting a little, but the thing is I do acknowledge what I’m doing but it sorta just makes me feel like a different person. Like I remember everything to an extent.
I also feel like I’m in a suit in a way. Like I control what I do but I’m still observing from a second view point. Like my brain is sorta pushed to the side.

I’m confused about what this is. And I would like to know as it is affecting things such as my gender and making it hard to recognise who I am as a person since my feelings, emotions and much more are a mix of everybody’s."

"Please No judgement, I am just trying to see if anyone else has an idea or something else to share. 

I am having such a hard time trying to figure out how to best support my 11 year old son.

Over the past 3 years,  my son has been STRUGGLING with his mental health.

At the beginning of covid he  was admitted to
A partial hospitalization program (day program) due to aggression and not able to regulate and the mobile crisis said it would be our best bet.

Symptoms - unregulated, aggression 

In Feb 2021 he was inpatient for  SH/SI  the did another round of partial hospitalization program.

Symptoms - Auditorial hallucinations, S/I, Rage towards older brother, very Dr Jekyll Mr Hyde personality

In Aug 2022 Yet again another inpatient due to. H/I  rage and aggression. And did partial hospitalization program again

Symptoms - aggression, becoming physical, destroying property i.e broken windows, things that belong to others in the home, fire setting, urinating out side of the bathroom  such places like air vents and kitty litter

In Jan 2023 He was sent to the CRC for 3 months and then transferred to inpatient for another 3 then another round of partial.

Symptoms - S/A family member, aggression, becoming physical, destroying property i.e , things that belong to others in the home, fire setting,  *tics develop * hair pulling, and locking around lips 

He is currently living with Grandparents due to the SA

In between all of the time frames he has had mobile therapist, behavior therapy, MST-PSB, Family base therapy. 

He is not responding to anything,  when he comes home he does well for a out 3 months then he spirals. And it's at a drop of a hat.

His current dx are-  ADHD DMDD, tic disorder, conduct disorder. generalized anxiety disorder 
WE are waiting for the findings to come back for his autism evaluation 

Current meds - No judgement - Adderall, Zoloft clonidine, melatonin

Personally I don't feel like these diagnoses are accurate.

I have been thinking about BPD, PAN/PANDAS, AND I hate to admit it but socio

I downloaded the dsm5 since I was getting no where with doctors and when I would bring up my concerns they would say well because of his age we can't do this because of his age we can't do that and it's getting very frustrating because the more we sit around and wait for him to turn into a teenager the worst he's getting."

"Hi OP. A couple things:
Are you working with a specialist in child and adolescent psychiatry? If not, take a look at AACAP. 

My son was very ill as a child and his doctor (pulmonologist) went from one diagnosis to the next with no luck. He kept getting worse. I sat down with him and said “Who are some of the most highly regarded children’s pulmonologists in the country?” He gave me a list of names. I said, “Is it possible to send my son’s records to them for an evaluation?” He sent them to one and within a month we had a correct diagnosis. 

It may be possible for you to try this approach and get some guidance. Some doctors will charge for evaluations like this, others don’t. But I’d really recommend you give it a try if you can."	Impressive_Panic_806	reply	na	na	na	0.9919872283935547	weak	strong	strong	na	MentalHealth
"I (19f) struggle with my mental health for quite some time. I am diagnosed with moderate depression, general anxiety disorder and ocd.
I feel like especially my anxiety gets worse and worse.
Ofc there were times where my depression was so bad I wanted to k*ll myself and I'm always grateful when I'm not in this situation but still I can't live a normal life.
I never was a person who went out allot but I had times when I was going out more and having fun.
Now I don't go out almost at all.
I can't even go to school for most days and the last time I met up with friends was over 3 months ago.
When I plan something I often end up canceling bcs I get psychosomatic symptoms bcs of my anxiety.
I can't see myself being able to have a romantic relationship.
I can't see myself handling all the stuff that is easy or natural or even enjoyable for other people.
It's really frustrating for me because I know that I'm a friendly person.
If I meet people they always have a great first impression of me and there are allot of guys who are interested in me until they realize I actually suck bcs I can't even do normal things I should be able to do.
I'm scared my friends will be tired of my inconsistency...
I don't feel satisfied with myself either.. I wanna live a normal life but my brain is screaming to hide myself to be safe.
I have the feeling that I'm all alone with these problems and thoughts and that no matter how often I try to explain it, that no one really understands.

"I’ve read that social media detox may benefit one’s mental health. I have some downtime right now and I was thinking of trying a 4-day detox which may be extended.

I plan on uninstalling the following apps: facebook, twitter, instagram, reddit and facebook messenger. 

Here are my questions:

- Will 4 days be enough?

 I also use social media for school purposes and in this case, hence limiting the detox to 4 days. But I will extend it should there be no need to use social media. I am planning to have a friend relay to be important announcements. 


EDIT: Would having a facebook account dedicated solely for school defeat the purpose of the detox? 

- Should video games be also be included? 

Or is there and added benefit in including video games? I don’t really play video games but I’m thinking that I may start playing since I would need things to do. 

- What other apps should be included?

I plan on still using viber, telegram and email so people can reach me.

"Hello everyone! Hopefully this is an acceptable place for this post. Anyways, I’m really looking for advice on why I’m feeling this way. The past few weeks I’ve been feeling just off. Stressed for no reason. Feel like everyone hates me. I struggle to communicate with others and form bonds. Feelings of sadness. Haven’t felt very highly of my self. I’m generally a very happy person. But This is extreme for me hence why I wanted to reach out to the Reddit community. An example is that I feel like one of my good friends doesn’t like me much but he went out of his way to invite me to a party Saturday. 

What is this? Anxiety? Depression? I’m 32 and very healthy. Exercise almost daily. No drugs but I do drink more than average, majority is socially and never alone.

would you say you’ve only felt this way over past few weeks or are they feelings you find keep coming back to you? if it’s just for a short space of time i would say it’s probably just a bit of a down phase that people go in and out of but if it was to continue then for sure that sounds like anxiety to me. even the fact you question whether you’re experiencing anxiety is a sign that something isn’t okay. i often feel swamped by my anxiety and all of the thoughts and feelings you described are definitely part of that for me. one bit of advice i’d give which may seem like it’s not useful right now but could be in the future - ‘don’t worry about something that hasn’t happened yet because you’re putting yourself through it more than once’. i remember reading it and always try to come back to it, i try not to stress about things when they haven’t even happened yet because there’s no need to put myself through it any more than the one time. good luck to you and i hope things get better very soon :)	ss236	reply	na	na	na	0.9964410662651062	no	no	strong	na	MentalHealth
"Well from what you said it's clear to me why you feel this way:

>**Feel like everyone hates me**. I struggle to communicate with others and form bonds. Feelings of sadness. **Haven’t felt very highly of my self.**

**Our Thoughts affect our mood**: What we think is what we feel, if you spend all day thinking bad things about yourself then you will feel bad. For example if you are thinking that your friend doesn't like you because you are flawed and that nobody will love you then you are going to feel sad and ""off"".  
  
Taking the blame for everything and thinking negatively about yourself is the equivalent of eating rotten fruit: *It doesn't matter who sold that to you, don't eat it!*  
  
All those thoughts that you have, you gotta ask yourself:  
  
**Are they actually true?**  
  
**How useful are them?**  
  
If you assume something as true without questioning it, you will let this very toxic thoughts ruin your mood daily. This internal dialogue, even if in some situation is true, is not useful, and consuming that daily will make your mood worse.

>An example is that I feel like **one of my good friends doesn’t like me much** but **he went out of his way to invite me to a party Saturday**.

""One of my friends doesn't like me much"" > *Is this true? What evidence do you have?*

""He went out of his way to invite me to a party"" > This means your initial thought was wrong, because you have evidence against your first affirmation.

^(Apply this process to all your negative thoughts. Practice for 1 weak to defeat this ""Critical Parrot"" in your head.)

If you practice this exercise with all your negative thoughts (write them down) then you will see results in a couple of weeks, when you get the habit of it.

"This might not be *directly related* but I'm desperate for a little guidance. My doctors have told me ""it'll go away soon"" for years and it hasn't....

I've been on mental health meds for almost half a decade now. I've gone years without anything working and recently found out from a DNA test that almost every medication I tried wasn't recommended because of my drug-gene interactions. That's beside the point. They've caused persistent tardive dyskinesia, epilepsy flare-ups, and other issues over the years. Of all these things, shaky hands and poor motor skills have stuck around the longest and been more prominent lately.

Besides medications to help, I love journaling, hand lettering, playing the piano...stuff like that to help with the depression and anxiety. It's incredibly relaxing but it's becoming beyond frustrating that I can't do these things at all. I'm wondering if anybody has had experience with a steep decline in motor skills while on *and after stopping* these meds. It's especially terrifying since I'm only in my 20s. Like I said, I'm desperate for some guidance. I know it affects us all differently but I'm open to hearing any perspectives.

"That's great. Maybe I should comment that although doctors know how to prescribe, they are not always experts on addiction. I'll tell you about some resources.  
  
SMARTRecovery.org is like a brainy version of NA, ex-users who believe in psychology. They have a program based on the most popular counseling methods.  
  
A Yale medical journal says that the best things for avoiding relapse from addiction are relaxation with traditional Asian methods and cognitive therapy.  
  
The Asian method with the best evidence is slow breathing. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.  
  
More info, including the 3-part mind-body program of Brown and Gerbarg, here -

Deep breaths. Breathe. Being somewhere you're unfamiliar with can cause these emotions. Before you leave, it may be best to plan on your own travel to the airport. Find the proper area, the proper protocols, and as long as you follow the instructions,  getting to your plane should be less stressful since you've planned ahead.	amon_yao	reply	na	na	na	0.999089241027832	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealth
"Please - listen to *expert advice* on how to breathe during a panic attack. The video by the therapist shows you how.  
  
Panic disorder often responds to self-help. In fact, Handbook of Self-Help Therapies, which reviews studies of books and programs, says that of all the disorders, panic disorder is the one that’s most responsive to self-help.   
  
  
I heard someone say that although slow breathing is good for moments of panic, the attacks keep coming back. So, it looks like cognitive therapy is also helpful. Cognitive therapy for panic disorder involves understanding what the attack is. The symptoms are nothing but your system's natural responses to whatever seems threatening. You shouldn't get upset about them. You don't worry about fast heartbeat when you run, and there's no reason to fear it with a panic attack. Source - When Panic Attacks by Dr. David Burns.  
  
Dr. Burns is the author recommended most often by mental health professionals, according to Authoritative Guide to Self-Help Resources in Mental Health.  
  
  
You can't go wrong with stress management. It's something we all need. This could help you with your problem.  
  
Psychology Today online says that Dr. Dave Carbonell is a clinical psychologist who specializes in treating fears and phobias and the author of three self-help books, including Panic Attacks Workbook.  
  
In this video, Dr. Carbonell demonstrates a breathing exercise that he says is helpful for panic attacks.  
  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRIV2R3jzaQ&t=49s  
  
  
  
One of the best treatments is time. You know the old saying ""Familiarity breeds contempt."" After a while, the attacks are seen as a nuisance instead of a threat. Then the attacks become less frequent and finally go away altogether.  
  
I’ll tell you about two other things that you probably won’t need. It’s good to know they’re there if you need them.  
  
A study by a researcher named Meuret at Southern Methodist University showed that a biofeedback method called CART that reinforces slow, shallow breathing was effective. Slow breathing is often recommended, but deep breathing tends to promote hyperventilation, making it hard for people to breathe. Many people use slow breathing self-help successfully.  
  
There's a treatment called interoceptive exposure therapy. It's teaching people not to fear the symptoms of the panic attack by deliberately bringing on the symptoms - for example by bringing on a fast heartbeat by aerobic exercise."	amon_yao	reply	na	na	na	0.999089241027832	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth

I know exactly how you feel. Longing to have it all together and it seems like no aspect in life is good. I just want you to know that you still have your whole life ahead you at the very young age of 22. I know it all seems messy right now but the life you want you will have it. Take some time to write out exactly what the job you will like entails such as the industry, hours, what does a typical day look like for you, how it makes you feel, who you will be working with. Do this for what a good relationship is for you. Write out what brings you peace and happiness no matter how small and mundane it may seem and do that thing. If it just going out for a walk to leave your parents home. Start small in one area of your life to bring happiness and it will begin to transfer into other areas. I know it doesn’t seem like it but you are in a unique position to define what you want for your life and not settle.

"So I'm a 16 yo Kenyan and if you are a Kenyan more so an African you know that mental health is not taken seriously in Kenya …

I have a lot of destructive habits and I try to avoid hurting myself but it doesn't work

My parents have sent me to an all girls catholic boarding school and It is one heck of a experience but I just wanna stay strong from now till Dec 2023 because I'm almost done with school but that school makes me feel like I'm running mad... from people stealing from me, homophobia and people triggering me so that i do outrageous things because I'm dramatic and have anger issues and some ""behavioral issues"" plus all my baggage from home plus my childhood 

It makes me more and more destructive and my grades were good when i joined but ive been dropping and its just like my primary(middle school) when my mental issues began My grades were amazing then began dropping in 2020 aka my breaking point I managed to push myself and get a decent grade finishing primary but i and finding it hard to push myself right now but i need to push at least so that i finish school and make some little money and pay for my own  therapy because my parents are so had to talk to about mental health but I need help so if you have any tips to help me manage my destructive habits, bad grades, hallucinations, nightmares, lack of focus, terrible concentration ,clouded mind, anger issues, constant breaking down and insomnia please share  with me :) 

all i really want is good grades ....

"That’s a rough sounding school. All I can say that it is a blessing to be young and to have only yourself to be worried about and distraught about. When you are older and if you have kids like I do, your own mental health is even more challenged with the pain and trauma of those you love, the children you created. 

There is so much pain and suffering in this world it will always be hard. I suggest Eckhart Tolle’s books and YouTube videos; he does a great job at talking about how to find happiness and accept pain. He says that all animals experience diversity and suffering every day, but that is how evolution happens. If we aren’t pushed up against a wall and threatened with adversity, there would be no reason for any animal to evolve and get stronger. 

Please keep fighting, keep pushing yourself to get up every day and stand up. It is what I do every day in spite of huge adversity and times of pain will pass for a while and that’s all we can do. I find that having a purpose in life centered around helping others and being of value is very positive. Have a goal, have a purpose of something you need to accomplish. It will get you moving.

"You have a lot of worries and things you want to focus on.

One thing is remember that some things right now will be beyond your control, try to let these not bother you as much, it’s not worth it if you have no control.

Other things you will have moderate control over and you can let that take up a good chunk of mental energy as you have some influence on it.

Things you have complete control over you need to try to make into a routine or automatic so you don’t have to think about them. Saving energy for that moderate control category.

A good routine involves good sleep both in duration (8hrs+) and in going to bed the same time each night. It’s really important especially if you’re stressed out. This helps mentally and emotionally, I went insane in school when I didn’t sleep and because a huge dramatic asshole. Don’t be like me.

For school work it helped when I would take 5 minutes to make a movie in my head and visualize what I would need to do each day in the morning. When done with class after I had a snack I would visualize what I needed to do for the evening. Otherwise sometimes I would forget homework or spend too long on one subject and not study or do the work on the other. 

I’m really sorry things are very hard and you’re in a tough environment. Everything will pass in time. Good luck. Try to take care of yourself the best you can."	Mi_Chi-iii	reply	na	na	na	0.011615166440606117	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealth
"Really sorry to hear how you’re feeling and how difficult a lot of these symptoms and behaviours are to live with. 

Sounds like you have a lot of emotion that is “bottled up” and not permitted to be spoken about or shared with others or to have those feelings be looked after or cared for by another. 

Is your boarding school in Kenya? Are there any resources there on offer for students in terms of talking through problems or guidance counselling? 

Feels like you need to find people you can trust and share this burden of expectation with. 

We all need perspective to help us overcome challenges or just cope with how painful our experiences can feel. Connection with others can be a really valuable way to achieve that perspective. 

Otherwise, we need to think about coping mechanisms and learning what you need and what works best for you.

What are some of the things that make you feel so stressed or worried? How can you best make plans or develop habits to help tolerate and ease your way through them?

Sometimes when we are overwhelmed we need to have a plan in place to learn to get through those moments and over time build resilience and belief that those moments of overwhelm will pass. Someone else in the subreddit shared this page of coping mechanisms recently that I think is valuable:  https://sunrisertc.com/distress-tolerance-skills/

Also: What do you enjoy doing more than anything else? What really makes you feel alive and free? How can you build this activity or hobby or interest into your daily life so you have a reason to put up with all the hard stuff? 
Or rather, what habits and routines keep you feeling happy and healthy? 

For example: Spending time doing things that are physical and active whilst listening to music can help regulate our moods and process feelings in a way that talking doesn’t. 

If you were in the UK I would recommend having a conversation with your GP (doctor) and discussing what therapies or counselling options are available and what medications might help with your symptoms of distress and sleep problems.  

Finally I would say continue to do research and educate yourself on what sort of problems or worries you’re experiencing. Write a journal. Keep a record of good and bad days, what triggers you and what helps. Lean into what helps, share your progress with others. You will find people online who are experiencing the same issues as you - find out what they’re doing to help with hallucinations or anger issue and nightmares. 

Sorry I can’t think of anything else to write in this moment. 

You’re making a really good start in helping yourself by asking others for this advice. If you continue in a determined way you will find some positive ways to move through your distress and learn to live in a happy and healthy way. Wishing you all the best of luck on your journey."

"I always thought that as I grew older and had more experience of the world and of life, I'd become more confident, more secure, more relaxed and generally happier. This hope always kept me going.

Instead, as I've tried new things, visited more places, met more people and had more experiences, my mental health has not improved at all. Meanwhile, my hope that it would improve has faded and faded, making me feel even more hopeless.

Everybody says ""take one day at a time"" and ""you'll get through this"" and ""this too will pass"" (I fucking hate that last one), but for me it's just got worse with time.

Yeah it does feels like that. For me, that’s just what depression is though. It’s like an unfulfilled expectation that leaves you feeling empty all the time no matter what you do. And the more you do, the more you’re reminded nothing can change it. It is possible that what I’m feeling is not my mental health getting worse but just the decrease of hope that it will get better. Which kind of just makes it ‘louder’ if that makes sense? Knowing it’s just not going to go away when I expected it to just makes it more apparent and not necessarily worse. I guess it does make it more depressing…Either way i feel like I need to stop relying on my age to just make things go away because it’s obviously not working. I’m 21 which may be old or young to you but shouldn’t invalidate what I’m also feeling. I’ve just noticed that others have seemed to ‘grown out’ of it while I still feel stuck but i know it’s my own (lack of) doing that’s led me here and it’ll have to be my own doing that gets me out.	fi-ri-ku-su	reply	na	na	na	0.9994480013847351	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealth

The one silver lining is - as a child you don’t know crap. You are not equipped to heal your mental health when you are a kid, and have no clue where to start or what to do. However, as an adult you are grown, experienced, intelligent and capable.

"My mom. she’s gonna be the death of me, whether that’s me ending it all myself or she finally gets too angry. 
my mother has had constant issues with me for the last year and a half. i’ve gone through dips of depression, self harm and eating disorders, which she seems to pretend she is blissfully unaware of. she hasn’t ever really been extremely bad with me, but about a month ago she just…lost it. 

I had gone out with my partner one Thursday afternoon to the movies. Me and him were happy and had a lovely day, i then got home and i helped my mother with some basic chores. I cleaned, i tidied and i helped make dinner briefly. Me, my brother, my mom and dad ate peacefully, then she dismissed me to go and shower. I run up to my room and sit on my bed and suddenly feel…paralysed. I could get up, move, walk, but something prevented me from leaving my bed and showering. My brain felt too heavy. I felt just….chained to the bed. I stayed there for, what, 15 minutes until i hear my mother coming up the stairs. I swear at myself under my breath and she starts shouting at me for not showering. I try my very very hardest to stay strong and not show my feelings, so i step into the bathroom and shut the door. I turn the shower on hurriedly and then go to step in and the water is dashing from boiling hot to freezing cold every 10 seconds. I have extreme sensory issues sometimes, and this triggered it to no end. I tried desperately to get into the shower because i knew the consequences of disobeying my mouthed would be catastrophic. I try and i try to get my hair wet but she’s screaming at me through the bathroom door. At this point i am laying on the floor, phone in hand on call to my boyfriend and asking desperately what to do. This crazy bitch at the door eventually walks off, leaving me to get up of the bathroom. I shout down the stairs, covered in tears and snot that ‘i can’t get in and it’s too hot and please i just need some time~’ but all i get in reply is her screaming at me again: 
‘BULLSHIT, YOU UNGRATEFUL BRAT, YOU’VE RUINED EVERYONE’S EVENING NOW, CAN’T YOU DO ANYTHING FOR SOMEBODY ELSE BUT YOU?!?’ 
I wailed and i cried for 2 hours that evening. Not once did she ask me why, or if i was okay. She told my dad, but since me and him have a much better relationship, he didn’t really believe her story,but he couldn’t fight for me because he knows that she would crucify him too if he tried to stand up for me. I feel trapped sometimes and i don’t know if there’s a way out of this. Stuff like that has been happening for about 4 weeks now, on and off and i am so tired of it all. Help."

"You need some sort of normality or something different

First of all

Loving yourself kinda exists but its a stupid term as u cant love yourself forever 

What you can do and keep forever is self acceptance and that leads to self love and even when self love fails.you have self acceptance to fall back on

Accepting who you were, what you are, accepting the things you've been handed in life genetically 

Thats what you need to aim for

Then id say go gym but more so instead do boxing or something similar where you can meet more people"	umavisvires	reply	na	na	na	0.9980801343917847	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth

There are different opinions about these drugs, which are very effective for calming people down but potentially very dangerous. Benzo addiction is a widespread and very serious problem. Some say that benzos are safe so long as the patient does not have an addictive personality, but how can a prescriber be sure of that?   
  
It's important for people to know about options.  
  
There is encouraging evidence for therapeutic breathing, and this can be used with cognitive therapy methods for anxiety. The American Psychological Association says that most people with anxiety disorders do better with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) than with medicine.

"In the past 5 or so years, I've experienced what I'd describe as anger issues, paranoia (if I hear any voices ambiently around me, I assume they must always be talking either badly or positively about me), anxiety, and self-loathing, and constantly overthinking because I know I'm notorious for slipping up or messing up on little things (losing things places, forgetting things, not seeing obvious things that others do when presented the same situation).   


I have the greatest and most supportive partner I could ever ask for, but I feel I continually come up short in literally every way to show I appreciate it.  


I've spent quite a lot of money across 6-7 different therapists over the years, but I seem to have the same general issue: I just end up overthinking and talking endlessly, but there's no way forward?   


I am like just trying desperately to like flush out my anxieties and worries and revert back to just a state of purely myself to figure out what I'm doing wrong; but there's never any suggestions or ideas or structure or guidance on their end to know what I'm supposed to be doing... maybe there's effective ways to communicate what I'm looking to get out of therapy?

A lot of people find a lot more help on their own using things like books, podcasts, YouTube videos. You can then discuss with your therapist if you want. But there are a ton of great licensed professionals on YouTube. It can give you a frame of reference, a context for all the random and overwhelming thoughts and feelings, and a path forward that’s structured (for lack of a better term).

So I’m 16 at the moment and have had a fear of developing schizophrenia for a long time, this started when I was in a situation that was extremely stressful and made me very anxious where I would think that I saw something in the corner of my eye look and there’s nothing there (these things I saw were mostly movement that I couldn’t really make out) I then proceeded to do a bunch of research on schizophrenia and freak myself out. This then happened one more time but to a lesser extent with another anxious situation I was put in. I’ve never had any delusions but today at work I convinced myself that I was sent home early not because they didn’t have anything for me to do but because they didn’t want me there and I became anxious that I was acting insane at work for some reason.

"Some experts recommend seeing the doctor first. One reason is that if you need a psychiatrist, as opposed to a clinical psychologist, you need a doctor's referral. An advantage of seeing the doctor is that you can talk about your overall health, and sometimes this is the cause of a psychological problem. Also, your doctor may be able to recommend someone good.  
  
Just a bottle of pills is not a good solution, but the doctor can prescribe ( a psychologist can't)  
  
You probably don't need a referral to see a psychologist, and you can use that website to find out about therapists.  
  
I should mention that the demand for therapists is such that the online services have become very important.  Healthline, a site I rely on for good information, has an article that rates online services.

"I'm not sure where to start with this.  So I'll just build the story.

I spent the first 30 years of my live growing up in the suburbs of a Midwest city.  It was great, I loved it.  I met my wife there and we decided we wanted to go west for adventure and mountains.

We moved to Washington state, where we have been for the last 4 years.  We have built an amazing community, own a home, and have amazing adventures together.

However, ever since we moved here I've been feeling very upset (I don't know the right word to use) about the visible crime / homelessness.  The reality is where we live it doesn't affect us day to day.  Sure we see it on our commutes, we are careful with our bikes, etc. but its not like we are on the public transit in Seattle dealing with it. We actually live over 50 miles away from Seattle.

The feeling I get reminds me of the ""[this is fine](https://miro.medium.com/v2/0*ZjYSm_q36J4KChdn)"" meme. Where America, and specifically the west coast, seem to be going through some shit.  Maybe its COVID, I don't know.

This really started weighing on me, affecting my mood and my sleep.  I was unable to 'unhinge' from this concern.  I started doing the following things:

1. Following and reading articles / subreddits specifically about how shit Seattle is that highlights the crime / homelessness issues.
2. Somehow getting into more right-wing Youtube content, which is just a huge amount of fear-mongering.  I'm not even political so I hate this.
3. Researching how we could move to Japan or Switzerland to avoid the hellscape that America has become

But again, when I go outside and touch grass  I should be realizing what a beautiful place I live in. We live in a beautiful home, with a supportive community, access to great cities and nature...  live is amazing.  I don't feel that way though.  I can't let go of these thoughts and enjoy live.  Its wearing on my mental state, and clearly is wearing my wife down a bit.

This is the big issue on my mind, but if its not this then I'll obsess over a neighbor who put a weird light in their yard, or something else.  I'm chasing some sort of eutopia that doesn't exist maybe?

Any suggestions?"	ContractCreepy4861	post	35.541646119199996	male	White	0.9917252063751221	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth

"My best friend has been the closest person to me in the past few years, we tell eachother everything, and we spend a lot of time together. I've always had a crush on her, although i know it's never going to be reciprocated since I'm a lesbian and she's straight. This crush has slowly developed into something weirder, I started finding myself being jealous of her other friends and of her boyfriends, starting to hate her whenever she didn't give me ""enough"" attention even though the amount that i consider enough often varies on my mood and it's usually unreasonable; I started thinking that she was going to leave me every time that she forgot to answer a text for a few hours, or everytime she was too busy to hang out with me. I overfocus on every word she says to me, my perception of her opinion of me is what I base my self worth on, I idolize her, thinking that she's superior to me in everything and she deserves to be treated better than other people. I look at our relationship in a very black and white way, whenever she does something that even sligthly upsets me I find myself starting to hate her, wanting to distance myself from her for the smallest things, but whenever she is nice to me I feel like the happiest person on earth, I feel like I can't live withouth her and that if she ever left me my life would be ruined. Her attaention and appreciation feel addictive, and in my opinion is safe to say that my way of viewing her is not healthy, I really don't want to leave her, since it would take a big toll on my mental health, and she also has done nothing to deserve this treatment, but I also know that if we keep being friends my obsession is just going to grow and become more toxic.

"every single word you said was me from 2020 to 2022, literally i was almost scared readimg your post bc it felt like i wrote every single word

i (f 23) had the same problem with a friend (f 28) i was in love and obsessed with for almost a year and half in every single aspect you mentioned except that she wasn’t straight and at first we both had a mutual crush and became fwbs, had exactly 4 hookups till she caught real feelings and decided we should be normal friends again, her feelings returned to friendship… mine didn’t

after a year of being really really close friends and got closer to out mutual friends too, but she noticed my black and white behavior with her and sadly saw it as me not having confidence in our friendship and decided to put a wall between us and said i can only dm her on her public acc that she never used 

i panicked, i sobbed, sobbed and screamed for hours almost dying every day especially bc she rarely texted me back there, went to therapy for the first time and after a while of me trying to explain that things can be good and tried reaching out through a friend she blocked all my accs and unfairly talked badly about me of things i didn’t do to all our friends, and they all chose to lose one friend than many friends 

in just 3 months i lost the love of my life and i lost everyone else i loved because of her, after losing all my group of friends i hurt myself but i survived but i hated her almost as much as i loved her… but no i didn’t hate her i was just obsessing more and more

that was all a year and 3 months ago and i’ve been in therapy and antidepressants since then, my grades sucked in my last year in college, stopped wanting anything from life and i became a different person and i can’t return again i miss my old self so much 

it’s weird how someone could affect me this much longer but now that i’m starting to get out of my zombie like state (at least not crying for hours every single fuckind day), i can give you one advice, don’t cut her off as some might tell you but try to almost ignore her and try to meet new ppl you can connect with, especially other lesbians, i know rn she’s your fav human being but as extremely hard as it is, you HAVE to slowly start getting less addicted even as bad as the (real)withdrawal symptoms might be, as long as you do it slowly and don’t cut her off it will be much easier i promise you, maybe already start seeking therapy if it’s available for u cause that never hurts anyway, this is all what i regret not doing so please please just start actively trying to talk to her less(not badly but just less), convince yourself that she’s just like any other person(bc she IS), she’s not a god and ik it’s hard but her affection thoughts and opinions about you do NOT define you, 

and PLEASE meet new ppl to keep you busy and keep telling yourself you WILL find someone that you can love and love you back and that you will still be friends with her, even very very close and lose her, but it will be a healthy friendship, one that doesn’t hurt you

i don’t think anyone can understand every single word you said completely and relate as much as i do so i am sending so much love to you even if you don’t read this💗

I don’t know if it would be the same but I had a friend VERY much like you. We addressed it first of all and ended up taking a break from each other for a while. Eventually after a few months, and possibly with the help of therapy, their feelings of obsession faded and we were able to be friends again. Of course, everyone’s different so what worked for them might not work for you! But I really do think if you’re not willing to leave your friend completely, at least take some time away from her and address what you’ve been feeling with her.

"You absolutely have the right to feel that way. I’m actually in a very similar situation at 22. In high school, I came to terms with the fact that yes, my mom is placing things on me she shouldn’t. And I think it’s better to realize that sort of thing. I know sometimes this doesn’t work, but talking to her could be an option if you’re comfortable. Though I know, like you said, she is very critical. 

I’m sorry you have to go through this. No child should have to grow up too fast in order to deal with burdens of their family. And I’m sorry I don’t have more advice as I’m still in a similar situation myself. But please understand that it isn’t right for your mother to place all of these things on you. My mother works hard too and has 2 jobs and I’ve had the same guilt. Your mother is going through something, but so are you. She doesn’t know how to deal with it so she leaves you to pick up the pieces. Which just ends up hurting the both of you, really.

"The good news is that sometimes people get over panic disorder quickly.   
  
Panic disorder often responds to self-help. In fact, Handbook of Self-Help Therapies, which reviews studies of books and programs, says that of all the disorders, panic disorder is the one that’s most responsive to self-help.

About your social anxiety, this might be a problem that will take some time to work out with a professional. I'll mention two books that can help. Handbook of Self-Help Therapies, which reviews studies of books and programs, says that the writings of Barbara Markway help people with moderate social anxiety. Her most recent book is Painfully Shy. How to Win Friends and Influence People has been a best seller for generations.  
  
  
Someone here has said that two things were very helpful for her social anxiety - a sport, playing on a high school team, and working at a place that gave her detailed instructions for dealing with customers. The second thing reminds me of a resource businesses often recommend for their sales people - How to Win Friends and Influence People  
  
  
Slow breathing can help with awkward social situations and phobias. You can get good and relaxed, then imagine yourself in a situation that makes you nervous.  Doctors recommend a simple exercise - breathe gently through the nose, 6 sec inhale and 6 sec exhale.  
You can also slow your breathing just before and during a conversation.  
  
  
There is some evidence that mindfulness helps. Apps like Headspace are very popular. Mindful Life Project is easy to use and free.

"Therapist here so I am a little bias. Therapy can be a great tool (just as effective as medication, and super great when used with medication). If you can, I would look for some online therapists in your area and see if you can get in with them before middle of july. They can also help prepare you for the meeting with your doc in July! I would suggest looking at mental health match (its free) and can connect you with therapists who could be a good fit for you!

So my husband was sexually abused by his older cousin when he was a child. He doesn’t like to talk about it so I’m not sure how old he was or how often it happened. Now we are adults and this cousin acts like nothing happened. He tries to talk to us and message us about random things. We live far away so fortunately we don’t have to see him often. No one in the family knows. My husbands mom will talk about the cousin and the children he is having. Send us pictures of their babies etc. I want nothing to do with this person. I want to tell him to stop contacting us but my husband doesn’t want to stir the pot. What should I do? How would you handle this?

Nothing's changed, what I hear the most is if you don't want to help yourself it won't get better but if I don't think I'm worth saving and don't have the energy to try is that it am I just done? I've never had the energy to help myself, I don't think im worth saving. I've been this way my whole life, and in late life has only been getting worse, losing friends, failing relationships, failing school. I'm a failure and I don't have it in my to try. Now what, do i just give up, do I finally get the balls and take the leap? I've had enough of being lonely and forgotten. I've written the letters to those I cared for and am just waiting to finally have the energy to do it. I've heard every bit of advice of waiting for it to get better but I know it doesn't.

You probably won't even see this comment, but if you do, I want to let you know that YOU ARE SO NOT ALONE. We all have our dark times. Please don't end things. I know it's weird because I don't know you and probably never will, but I can really relate to you and it already feels like I've known you for the longest time. I understand how it feels and it feels HORRIBLE. 

This sounds impossible, but I promise if you TRY, you will overcome this. It's so important to start off by taking baby steps. Trust me. You think you don't have the energy to save yourself, but you do. Start off by doing something small, like going for a ten-minute walk around the park. Or maybe just brushing your hair, treating yourself to a nice snack or outfit you've been coveting. Clean your room, take a short shower, something along those lines. 

Just trust me. It'll help TONS. Please, please don't end things. You're not alone. If you ever  want to vent or need some advice, just reach out to me and I'll drop all my work and respond straight away. Promise.

These are the stuff

I can't make eye contact

I have trouble responding to people irl and over text like for example my friend sent me a text, I'd stare at it for hours on end and dread opening it and it'd stress me all day
And irl i just stand and shuffle my feet , it's like my mouth is frozen i can't do it

I take things too literally and i often miss sarcasm

I get overwhelmed a lot by things like the light being too bright or my hair touching me or a t-shirt feeling off...etc it sends me into complete meltdown and i can't function properly 

If something I'm used to is not there i can't function without it.

I think the world would be better off without me in it. In fact I know it would be. I'm going no where I live. I have family, a mum, dad and sister. They are brilliant and the only thing keeping me going at the moment. Other then that I don't speak to my wider family. I have no friend, I used to be we've stopped talking after a argument. As far as my family is concerned I'm still meeting up with them, in fact I'm just sitting in my car every evening until I know they have gone to bed and then coming back. Just so I haven't got to force a fake smile on my face and pretend that I'm happy. I've got a job which at the moment I'm not enjoying. I'm one of them people that my work colleagues only talk to when theirs no one else about but as soon as there is its like I'm invisible to everyone. I've never been in a relationship and realistically that's never going to happen. I have no support. I was under a mental health team but they discharged me last week, they told me that I cause my own problem, Maybe I do. I'm 27 on Thursday and haven't done anything with my life and as I'm getting older time is running out to make something of myself. I'm just tired of day to day life. I'm tired of waking up in the morning and having to force a smile on my face to make out to my family that I'm OK. So my question is how does someone that knows there not worth the oxygen that they breathe find hope to live?

The most important thing is knowing how to cope in a moment of crisis. It's very important to calm down. This will make you feel better and let you think clearly. A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly.

It’s been about three weeks since I moved into my new apartment, and all of a sudden I’ve been having some problems. This was my first permanent move out of my parents house after college, and I feel like the “novelty” stage of moving is finally over now that I’ve set everything up. I’m having trouble comprehending the move. I don’t really miss home, I’m just struggling to accept the fact that I’m living somewhere other than home for the first time in my life. It’s been very disorienting, and I’ve found myself panicking on the toilet, or suddenly feeling out of place like I’m somewhere totally unfamiliar, despite having surrounded myself with deco and furniture I’m familiar with. This issue especially manifests itself at night, because I start to feel scared and uncomfortable in bed. It feels like when I was a kid and couldn’t sleep at night because I was scared of monsters, or the dark. Ive tried breathing techniques or other CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) techniques to calm myself down, but haven’t found a solution yet. I know it might sound childish, and I certainly feel that way. I just want to know if this is a me problem, or if anyone else has had problems adjusting to a new place like I am.

"I don’t think it’s childish. I am 30 and just moved from my hometown for the first time a few months ago. I also really struggled with mental health after my move. For me it manifested more as depression and a feeling of disconnection from everything and everyone, not that I missed them per say, I just felt out of place and disconnected, floating. I think some of the roots are similar to what you’re going through. It’s a hard adjustment. It’s lonely and unfamiliar, and it makes sense how that could be anxiety inducing. 

I don’t have any easy fix advice. I don’t know that any of my experiences will help, but establishing a routine in my new place, reaching out to people and not isolating myself, and taking sleep aids to get through the night when necessary until things started getting better are the things I did that seemed to help.

I heard about one team I believe that were in the Olympics that were told (apparently) to wear trackers when they went out to make sure they don't go into food places or something. It was extremely strict and in my point of view, extremely unhealthy. I would honestly sit down and tell her you're worried about her. Make sure the way you phrase things doesn't make it sound like you're trying to tell her what to do but just tell her how you are feeling and trying to understand how she feels about it?

"That's way too little food to be eating considering she swims 4.5 hours a day

Swimming zaps so much energy it's a very intense sport

Daily recommended calorie intake for a female is 2000 calories, not even including the intense exercise she does

She should increase her food intake a lot

"1200 calories a day is what *I* should be eating. To give you some perspective, I don't exercise and I work from home. I'm quite sedentary. 

She needs to eat at least twice that in a day, maybe more. Her body is forcing her to slow down because she's starving herself. It's throttling her progress because it's *dangerous* for her to be that active with so little fuel. Her body is forcing her to care for it by refusing to perform.

If she's professional at all, like with a school or it's what she does for work, her team should have access to a sports dietician in some way. Ask her about it, and if she doesn't know she needs to ask her coach. 

If she's doing all of this without being on a team or with the guidance of a coach, she needs serious and immediate help. Short term, she'll injure herself and won't be able to swim at all. Long term she's going to damage her heart and potentially die.

Not trying to frighten, just trying to shed some light on how dangerous this situation can become, and quickly. It's good she's got people in her life to worry about her. This is quite worrisome."	Ok_Cup_6550	reply	na	na	na	0.9959024786949158	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealth
This is absolutely her undereating and overworking herself, I did this exact thing when I used to do races and cross country runs.  I worked out 2+ times daily and restricted my food ridiculously amounts and I suddenly went from a 13 mile run being my limit to running down the street completely draining me.  I realized I could do the 13 mile runs again when I would binge eat on occasion but I didn’t feel I was underweight.  The only thing that solved it was a knee injury which restricted me from working out altogether and I got to reflect and realize I was hurting myself.  I have no idea how to get her to accept this idea unless you can convince her to spend a full day eating outside of her diet, end up with a normal amount of calories, and then swim again late that day	Ok_Cup_6550	reply	na	na	na	0.9959024786949158	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealth

"Ignore the other comments listing single psychiatric diagnosis. There isn't a psychiatrically-defined disorder that specifically lays out 'false self-perceptions' as a disorder in and of itself. Rather, everybody has a false self-perception,  and to some degree this is healthy and normal. 

However, within some cases of pretty much any psychiatric condition you'll see self-perception skewing in some really extreme, bizarre and distorted ways. As such there is 'clinically significant distorted self-perception'. This is perhaps because our understanding of our selves draws from and goes on to shape our experience in a large way. 

Somebody amidst a psychosis may believe they are an angel. A depressed person may show (in fact I think it's fair to say we'd *expect* them to show) a negatively-skewed sense of self worth. Somebody anxious, or with ADHD, may feel themselves to be 'chronically incompetent'. Etc. 

All this is to say that purely seeing yourself in a misrepresentative way doesn't constitute 'mental illness'. But within many populations suffering from psychiatric disorders, you can see some of the most extremely skewed/biased self-perceptions.

"One common experience of thinking you're different is called grandiosity. That's an inflated sense of self, thinking you're much better than others, and exceptional in a good way. This isn't a mental disorder in itself but is diagnostic in other problems such as mania and NPD. 

People can have other delusions about being different as well. I used to know a schizo-effective man who figured out one day that he isn't the demon after all, it's everyone else around him.

"I (15M) naturally have an extremely high level of Testosterone and i think its the reason why i always feel like Sh*t. Through my whole childhood ive been always ""the man"" in the class, i got through puberty first, have an absurd amount of muscle mass for the amount of excercise i do, i have a very deep voice and i reached the height of 6'3"" when i was 13. I always thought i just had ""gifted genetics"" and was fine with that. This is not what this is about tho, for years ive always felt depressed and i just never really knew why. I never understood how everyone around me could be so happy with their lifes. My life is absolutely fine but im always feeling so down. Lately as i started going to the gym thinking it would benefit my mental health i have learned about many things regarding the field, one of them being Testosterone, I show every sign of having increased T. Most of them which i listed in the beginning, but more importantly increased anger and major mood swings, its so easy to get me mad but when i look at such situations in my head i cant help but go ""why was i so mad about this?"" And worse, i could have the best day of my life and still feel like wanting to end it all in the evening. My day can get ruined by the smallest inconvenience imaginable. Seeing an Ex Gf in the street? Might as well kms. I just cant help it. And weirdly, i dont even remember the last time i really cried, i just feel so miserably empty 24/7 catching myself staring at my ceiling for hours a night. Im not exactly sure if this is the reason im like this but its my running theory for now. I dont really know what to do about it but id like to hear your thoughts on this.

"So I (25F) have struggled with my mental health since I was 17 (though if I was to look in depth could argue since early childhood). Things have been better for the past few months and I thought  that would mean I could reintroduce good habits that would help me maintain my mental health long term. Turns out it's not that simple. Anyway I have an odd relationship with food, when things are good I enjoy cooking and eating healthy but it's been a couple years since I've been able to do that habitually. For a while now I've been eating out of necessity rather than pleasure and sometimes I have to force myself to eat because the thought of food makes me feel sick.

I had some blood tests last week and found out I am low in B12 and iron. This probably explains why I'm always so tired, which in turn impacts my mental health because I'm too tired to do the things I want to do that would make me happy. This is where I need help. How can I hack this when I work a fairly physical full time job and am always tired? Why does the thought of food make me feel sick? How do I stop it?

Eating out of necessity isn’t fun, but it’s needed. When you don’t want to eat, do your best to get something easy on your stomach and that you can eat but by bit over the course of some time.

"Take preventative measures! Drowsy Dramamine will do wonders, and also work as a placebo of “I have taken this medicine, the sickness is already taken care of.” Also, bring something cold. A small cooler with an ice pack or two. Put it on your pressure points when you start to feel sick- wrists, back of neck, bottom of feet.

"
24F. I’m anxious over everything starting with my age. I started feeling old and I’m agitated by the fact that I’ll get older. I’m disappointed with what I’ve achieved so far and particularly by the major I chose at university ( Literature) which was too far from my dream. I became a teacher and I’ve never had passion for it. I hated it before and hated it more after practicing. I feel it’s too late and it’s over my budget to pursue something else which is devastating me. I was a very bright student and would have achieved more. I’m devastated because I’ve been living on antidepressants for 8 years now. been on paroxetine which I think it distorted my mind and switched to prozac recently. My  doc. told me to take 2 bills aday but I’m taking only one because I don’t want to depend on antidepressants anymore but it doesn’t seem working. I don’t think I can live or think clearly without antidepressants. That’s not to mention dissociation that took over a huge part of my life. Another odd thing is time. I’m experiencing and perceiving time differently. I feel time flies too fast and I know it’s a common feeling and I used to feel it but not this way. I don’t know how the last 3  years passed. I didn’t feel or live them I’d say they were 3 days not 3 years. My perception of time is odd maybe because I just count days and wait for weeks to end but it’s a major contributor to my current anxious state. I’m lost in life and feel just like a failure."

"A lot of people feel lost in life, and feel like they should have everything figured out. You're definitely not alone in that. Life is a journey of constant growth and change. You won't wake up one day and feel like you have it all figured out, even when you're older. You're still very young, and it's totally understandable to still be learning about who you are, who you want to be, and what you want to do with your life. Don't put added pressure on yourself, or feel like a failure because of it. It's all a part of growing up, and people twice your age often go through the same thing. I'm twice your age, and my life has changed drastically over the last few years. I'm trying to figure out all of those things all over again.
Don't feel bad about taking medicine that makes you feel better. It's no different than taking medicine to feel better physically. If it can improve the quality of your life (especially while you're struggling), there's no shame in taking it.

"Hello.

My situation isn't the worst possible, but it's slowly getting to ""potentially life threatening"" levels.

First off, due to doctors resigning, changing shifts and such I was forced to take a break from anti-depressants + anti-anxiety prescription against my will (Pramatis, Deprexolet)

Second, I am autistic person ridden with some trauma, I was sure I unpacked it at therapy but clearly there are issues left...

The two above cause me to feel worse and worse, not able to do my job fast enough (falling behind minimal norm by about 17%). Again I have issues falling asleep (Deprexolet was also prescribed due to its side effect being drowsiness), getting enough sleep, random bouts of crying, groaning and random vocalized noises as my body tries to process my feelings and failing to.

(CW: body issues)

The bigger issue is, since end of March I struggle with breathing related physical sickness (tryin to cough out my lungs, overproduction of mucus (especially painful since I have nose built wrong so removal isn't easy as air often backfires onto top of my mouth), severe throat irritation (both pain and feeling of ticklish / itchy throat, inside of mouth).

Then over month ago second issue manifested, severe inflammation in both feet. Medicine doesn't help me walk without pain, just partially relieves stuff.

*Then* over week ago during medical checkup I've started feeling sudden pain in lower stomach area. Within 36 hours I had to go to ER, all signs pointing to it being severe inflammation of big intestine...

I've been struggling with some intrusive thoughts related to this, but recently during talk with relative struggling from muscle issues, in response to their joke about wishing to disable their spinal cord (fully joking about it) I made them genuinely concerned and afraid when I said that it's normal, I'd love to rip out my throat myself.

My intrusive thoughts are spilling out and already, in a way, hurt those who I care about. Combined with lack of antidepressants...

The title question. Would it count as life-threatening enough to visit the ER? Regular psychiatric visit is in middle of *September* and I don't want it to be too late.

Also, height related dysphoria. Grew up waaaaay too tall. And unlike short people, there is no healthy cure and I've been thinking up ways to surgically enhance preexisting scoliosis and cut out 1 cm chunks out of leg bones to actually shrink me. That's not healthy."	Nekomiminya	post	34.59446474374684	male	White	0.9961440563201904	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth

"I want to ask you all about this because it has become a really big problem in my life. I am 19, and I have really bad memory. Short-term, long-term, names, faces, objects, events, nothing seems to stick. My friends have began to notice and have became concerned. I have had major depression and anxiety since I was a preteen and I used a LOT of drugs growing up basically everyday I took dabs for 5 years and I did a lot of other things like mdma and pain pills. So I know that those are the reasons for it. I think smoking so much really fucked with my head honestly I know the drugs did too but I had no business smoking an ounce of wax in I’d say monthly. Maybe my insomnia has also played a part in frying my brain. 

I have no idea what I can do to help my brain and help myself remember things. So if you have any advice or things I should take please let me know your suggestions.
——————— 
These are a few things that have happened and made me realize just how bad it’s got. 
My friend told me something the other day, and when I was responding to it he told me he had told me the same thing 3 times on 3 different days and just kept bringing it up to make conversation. I still don’t know what he told me.
The second I left the mental hospital I forgot what the entire hospital and my room and what the patients and doctors looked like. 
I’ve met a lot of people that say I’ve met them before and we’re friends and I have no idea who they are. 
My dad gave me a bracelet on my birthday and I guess I loved it a lot and I broke it and he’s been trying to fix it. I tried so hard but I couldn’t remember receiving it, breaking it, what it looked like, or even my birthday.
One time I got into a whole physical fight with someone, made up with them on a different occasion and then they told me all about it and I had to pretend like I knew what she was talking about.
I’ve had sex with people I don’t remember having sex with.
I looked at my bookshelf today and I couldn’t remember a single thing I read from any of the books and when I opened one it was like reading a new book.
Constantly missing appointments, work, special events and plans to hangout. 
Don’t remember entire vacations, school events, basically anything.

Yes some of these interactions I may have been a little tipsy but most are completely sober.

This is really hurting me and my life. Because it really sucks for someone to not remember things all the time I imagine it must really hurt my friends feelings when they mention something we did together and I have no recollection of it. It makes me look like a soulless person and it hurts me far more than anyone else because most of the time I have to pretend I do remember."	angelgutzzz	post	24.630247097228537	male	White	0.998611569404602	na	na	na	2	MentalHealth

"As the title says, I (18NB) was able to say ""I love myself"" out loud today and feel like I mean it for the first time in what feels like years.

For some context, I was diagnosed with GAD last year and have been taking anti-depressants since January. I've been seeing a therapist for a couple years now, and have been making some (admittedly, *very slow*) progress. However, today felt like I took a giant leap forward.

Nothing ""exceptional"" happened. I woke up. Did some shopping. Made dinner and cleaned up my house a bit. Sat down and watched some ""Bluey"" in the evening. I just feel so in love with life right now.

As I was getting ready to go to bed, I looked in the mirror and said, ""I love myself. I am doing great.""

There was no immediate doubt. No ""what-ifs"" or fears for what will happen tomorrow. Just satisfaction with today. I know I won't always have days like today, and mental health journeys are a bit like a twisting river, but I feel like I'm getting a little closer to that calm lake at the end of the stream.

"I am extremely proud of you. I am a functioning depressed person, I work and go home (45-55 hours a week) but if I get chores done it makes me feel good and it should do the same for you. Take every day one step at a time and try to do more every day/week/month and you will notice the difference.

I know it sucks to have to exert so much energy just to be a somewhat normal person, but it can get better, you just have to keep pushing yourself (easier said than done I know).

Never underestimate your achievements by comparing yourself to others. Yes - those things to a lot of people are basic day to day activities but those people that just get up and do those things as routine are people that aren't struggling with that level of self care.

My boyfriend is admitting himself into a psych ward this weekend. He said he would tell me all the info like his grandma’s number, etc. I’m so worried. It’s not going to be 1-2 weeks, he said it’ll be a month at minimum. Will I be able to at least write and send letters to him? He lives 2 hours away so I was thinking I would mail them to his grandma for her to give to him in person since she is family and im sure allowed to visit. And if there is a phone in the facility he can call from how frequently and long can I call him for? I’m so heartbroken this is awful. Idk when I’ll see him again. I also am diagnosed with BPD and lots of other things (he is too) so this is really tough on me.	lilyjoh6	post	21.04570917011759	female	White	0.9994738698005676	na	na	na	5	MentalHealth
I’m so sorry you’re going through this. But it is a good thing that he is getting help. It takes a lot of guts to admit you need in patient treatment and actually seek it out. I hope it helps him.

I don’t read anything I just quickly have them shake it out so no contraband comes through. Also we take their cell phones upon admission and lock it in a safe at risk management. Our unit has two patient phones they can use 24/7 though.

And yeah once you’re admitted it’s kind of up in the air when you can leave. It’s up to the doctor and they determine if you’re a danger to yourself or others.

The treatments for anxiety and depression are not exactly the same, but they have some things in common. For example, relaxation helps with both problems.

"I don't know where to start, the main reason being that I'm feeling unhappy day in day out. For most of the day. Small things distract me but other than that I'm in a constant overwhelm and overthinking loop.

Firstly I am lucky and have nothing to be unhappy about - I have a good job. I work from home which I much prefer. my partner loves me and I love him, he is everything most women would count themselves lucky to have. I am financially stable. My friends are wonderful. My health and my families health is good which is the biggest blessing of all. 

But it's like I have a disconnect between my brain and the things I can see objectively around me. I just can't seem to relax into my life and feel content. I need help working out what's wrong and how to fix it. Here are just some of the feelings I deal with every day 

- I'm feeling low self esteem, I tried to think of a time when I liked myself and proud. The best I could come up with is I occasionally like the way I look or my outfit if I'm going out - I'm feeling a bit scared and trapped in my relationship. I love my boyfriend but I'm constantly plagued with thoughts that I don't know enough or do enough or haven't seen enough places before I settle down : yet I am happy with my life so why won't my brain quit. I think I have a bit more childhood trauma when it comes to commitment than I initially though  
- I'm constantly overwhelmed by work, personal life, finances, chores, needing to stay healthy. It plagues me from the moment I wake up until I go to bed. I never feel like I achieve enough
- these things make me feel like I'm under a constant dark cloud of misery and they make me guilty I'm not happy for all I have
- I feel bored and scared that there is nothing more to life than this 
- I can't completely my job properly because I'm in a constant crisis about the trajectory of my life 

I'm taking steps to combat this
- on the waiting list for therapy to just talk some of this out
- I'm awaiting ADHD assessment after my last therapist reccomended I go down that route too. My overwhelming thoughts and inability to concentrate are really affecting me 
- I exercise every day that I can which really helps
- I try to speak to my partner and family but it's so hard to articulate my problem without getting upset and I also  spend lots of time with them as I love being around people. 
- I'm trying to see the positive in things and practice gratitude 

Am I just depressed? I don't know what I want out of life and I'm finding it hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel"	Abracatdabra__	post	32.3396595406487	female	White	0.9977485537528992	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
"  
  
You say,   
  
""I'm constantly overwhelmed by work, personal life, finances, chores, needing to stay healthy. It plagues me from the moment I wake up until I go to bed.""   
  
You're talking about being stressed out and, although stress reduction is probably a good idea, I'm not saying that this is all you need.  
  
For one thing, the most common cause of depression is prolonged high stress, so depression is a likely diagnosis.  
  
But stress management is important for those who are prone to depression - good for prevention and it helps with recovery.  
  
Another reason why I think you should get therapy - you say this:  
  
""I never feel like I achieve enough."" 

Why? Anxiety? Something about your personality? Talk about this with a qualified professional.  
  
The self-help things for depression are mostly stress reduction. Details below.  
  
The lockdown has changed the therapy situation. You may want to look at online therapy and self-help. Healthline, a site I rely on for good information, has an article that rates online services.  
  
  
  
  
What I usually tell people -   
  
  
Treatment often begins by seeing the GP, who can give you a referral. I mention referral because just a bottle of pills is not a very good approach. The things you'd want to tell the doctor are how you feel at different times of day, any symptoms you might have such as change in appetite or sleep, and things in your life affecting how you feel.

"I dont know if its appropriate to post something like that here but i dont know who can i share my story with.
Hello everyone, I just got off my pc and decided to take shower, and when I was taking a shower I heard a strange sound like a whale singing, I did not pay attention to it until it was just annoying me, I asked my roommate if he heard anything, and he replied that he didn’t, then I continued to take a shower and it happened again. And moreover, I could not tell where the sound was coming from, as if it was in my head. But I only heard it when I forgot about this sound, and as I focused on it, and tried to understand where it was coming from, I didn’t hear anything, I don’t have any mental disorders and I didn't hear something like that before.

If as you say you have no mental problems, the most likely explanation by far is the mind's natural tendency to make sense out of information that makes no sense, like white noise, which is produced by a shower. It's like looking at a cloud and thinking that it looks like a horse's head.	Unhappy-Scallion-380	reply	na	na	na	0.9285606145858765	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth

"You may have heard the Serenity Prayer, which has good advice whether we are religious or not:  
    
""God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.""  
  
To change the things we can change and to have the wisdom to know the difference, we need to have the thinking parts of our brains in charge, and not let the emotional parts overwhelm them. That is also important for acceptance.

"I can't find genuine interest in anything. I am very impatient, restless and bored. My brain is so foggy, it's hard to speak properly. A lot of times I forget words.

I find it hard to learn and understand things. Many times I can't retain information. I'll forget things immediately after they're told to me.

I'm very avoidant of most people. I don't care what people say to me and most of the time I'm faking interest so that I don't look like a bad person. I feel like I'm just going through the motions most of the time. Life seems so boring and uneventful.

I'm pretty anxious and can't relax around most people. I feel like I have to put up a front. Appear friendly and nice. I literally do not know how to be myself in these situations, the fear is so strong that I don't know how to be anything else but this. It's kind of lonely and I feel like an unknown.

"Confidence is a great antidepressant.   
  
  
I can tell you some self-help things but I'm not saying necessarily that these are all you need. Treating a serious case of depression with nothing but self-help is risky.  
  
  
A famous psychiatrist, Abraham Low, said that when we can't control our feelings we can still control our muscles. If you tell your arms and legs to get you out of bed, they will obey. Count down from 10 and at zero, move with all your might.  
  
  
Try this when it seems that you're too tired to work. Lie on the couch, close your eyes, and get ready to work by imagining yourself working for 5 minutes. Think in terms of taking it step by step and starting with something really easy.  
  
  
Taking things in baby steps - very important. This is the key to motivation and motivation is the key to recovery.  
  
  
Just 20 min of brisk walking a day can help, and you can add to that gradually so long as you don't make yourself sick of exercise with too much.  
  
  
This is a motivation trick that's been used in behavior modification programs since the 1930s. If a task seems like it's too big, think of it as a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time, and start with something really, really easy. Cleaning - start by cleaning for 3 or 4 min and take a 5 min break. Homework - start by proofreading a paper or previewing a chapter you're going to read by looking at headings, sub-headings, etc.  
  
  
You can even use the baby steps principle for having fun. If you're not getting any enjoyment out of things, here's something people here have said is helpful with that problem. Look all over and do a complete inventory. You should be able to find at least one or two things you like, such as your favorite music or movie. If there's just one movie you like, watch it once or twice. Then, find movies that are like it in some way - with similar story or the same actor. Keep adding to your entertainment supply to give it variety.  
  
  
If you're thinking about professional help, treatment usually begins by seeing the GP, who can give you a referral. I mention referral because just a bottle of pills is not a very good approach. The things you'd want to tell the doctor are how you feel at different times of day, any symptoms you might have such as change in appetite or sleep, and things in your life affecting how you feel.  
  
  
If you're depressed, I can't tell you exactly what you need. There's no one size fits all solution. I can tell you though that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits.

"When I was very little I was very shy. I would hide in cupboards and under tables. 

When I went to primary school (ages 4-11), the teachers realised I didn't have much confidence raising my hand, and making friends. I was much better one-to-one than in a group. 

When I got to high school (ages 11-16), I thought people would be mean to me for smiling at them, so I gave then what I thought was a neutral look, but it turned out to be a dirty look. I felt inferior, and could not see why anyone would like me. I thought everybody hated me. I don't know how to interact with more popular people. 

I struggle to make friends. Now I'm at college I don't know how to interact with other people. I usually pick the person with no friends and become friends with them, because they seem less threatening. If they make other friends though, I tend to distance myself. I don't know why I do this.  I just want to be invisable. When it's lunch time I want to join my class, who are sitting around having lunch, but I don't know how to. I think they don't want me there, so I go and sit on my own in the toilet. I'm like this in other social situations too. At family events I don't know how to interact with people, so I follow my Mum around whilst everyone else is interacting. I don't look people in the eye. I flinch when anyone touches me. I sometimes feel pressure on my chest. If I see someone I know in a public place I panic and hide. I am even shy when talking to my family and friends, and will often hide out in the car. I hate giving people presents I find it embaressing and will hide them, so they don't open them when I am there. I hate giving speeches and talking on the phone.  I feel so alone. If I'm at a night club I sit on my own, just wishing I could join in. I can't talk to authority."	BigMeringue2805	post	17.25036735453852	female	White	0.9985218644142151	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth

There’s a lot that can help to be the better you, mental health is important for people with great minds honestly, the only reason people get fucked up is because they cant  control the neuroscience behind the mind, bad mental health is when you think alot, got nothing else to focus on or anything else to look forward to except what’s inside your mind. I feel self improvement techniques really do help a lot in being your best selves, since you’re the only one who knows yourself dearly, it helps when you care equally about your physical body and behavioural tendencies.	_radbrat_	post	41.69646108370535	male	White	0.0023636554833501577	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth

"Over the last few months I've rarely ever had any desire for food. I was in inpatient treatment for a long time because of my anorexia but I managed to get better. During that time i had to eat up to 3000kcal a day so it makes sense that I didn't have much appetite back then. 
I know that the loss of appetite I have right now is not caused by an AN relapse because the AN thoughts are completely missing. My physical hunger has returned completely but whenever I think about eating or see food I immediately get a sick feeling in my stomach. When I try to eat something I can only get down a few bites before i start feeling nauseous. Because of that eating often takes up many hours of every day because if my weight drops again I'll get sent back to inpatient treatment (possibly without being allowed to live at home again afterwards). 
Usually the only food I can eat without any problems are fruits and raw veggies. I've also lost the ability to enjoy food. It always feels like a chore, like brushing my teeth or taking care of my hair. It's tiring.
I'm often overly nervous, sometimes for no reason, and then eating gets even more difficult. I'm scared of losing weight and I want to be able to enjoy food again.
Any help, advice, support, whatever will be greatly appreciated because this is making my day-to-day life extremely difficult."	moosbaerchen	post	19.360197208158713	male	White	0.9984918832778931	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
"There are things other than AN relapse that indicate a need for you to talk with your doctor about this, in particular your mention of nausea, which suggests a physical illness you should get treatment for. Also, lack of appetite can be a depression symptom.

If this short message can even help one person it’s a success. Something I always keep in mind is just do one step further than depression wants you to. Don’t feel like getting out of bed just step out for a few minutes. Celebrate the small wins because that is a huge step forward in my opinion. Also everything worth doing is worth doing poorly, don’t wanna shower just put on fresh clothes, don’t wanna eat just have some water, don’t wanna brush your teeth have a mint. Remember even the smallest steps are still steps and change is a direction not a place. Change takes time and these small steps in the right direction should be celebrated. Days still suck of course, does suicidal ideation happen to me still of course, but it’s all about the small steps and eventually you’ll look back and be surprised how far you’ve come. Depression sucks majorly which is an understatement however just celebrate any small wins and don’t beat yourself up for not being able to do something or make progress one day. Trust me you got this, I know this seems cheesy and like a stupid speech but just give it a try. Like I don’t wanna go to the gym or even be active but I just do 10 push ups a day. You can even just do 1 just keep going I believe in you guys. I might not know all your stories or situations but I know you’ve got this. I am proud of you, I love you, and I believe in you."

"I’m really sorry if this isn’t the sub for this but I’m not sure what else to do or who else to talk to. 
 
I’m 19, a computer science student, gay, and have diagnosed depression and anxiety. All throughout my life I’ve struggled to find anything that I’m passionate about, and have for the majority of my life just filled my time with meaningless tasks to pass the time. I thought college would help with this, but it hasn’t. 
 
I’ve tried basically every sport, hobby, game, and really anything that doesn’t immediately sound unappealing, and I’ve enjoyed none of it. I think a cause for this is my abusive father, and how (to summarize) stunted my ability to express myself in various ways. 
 
The “hobbies” that I fill my time with and try to improve on have been consistently letting me down since I’ve picked them up, but they’re the “least bad” option. 
 
My main issue is that when I bring this sort of thing up with my therapist, he will ask a question that is intended to make me think, but I already know the answer to, and he’ll say “wow you’re really self aware and mature!”. Then will follow up with the standard “explore the world and yourself” (which I’ve done to the best of my ability). 
 
Part of my issue is that I’m very competitive, and gain most of my happiness from being “good” at something and it’s incredibly problematic. So it makes it hard to start anything with any competitive aspect to it (which I enjoy) incredibly hard since I see myself as inferior. 
 
I genuinely apologize if this is not the place for help seeking but I’m at a loss. There were some parts I missed out on specifically so if you have a question feel free to ask. Nothing works and I feel like I’ve been on a steady decline since middle school. Thank you for reading, and hopefully someone here will have a different perspective. ❤️"	JustPoy	post	25.535157841632135	male	White	0.9988110065460205	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth

It could be a million things. But I’ll state a few things.

Everyone’s mind is different and we’re prone to certain problematic routines or habits or mental modes. It’s why workaholics, gaming addicts, and many people with toxic vices exists.

You find rewards and drive in accomplishing things and have done so competently. That’s a good “problem” to have. You now need to refine yourself and moderate yourself. That takes self discovery and time. It definitely beats being lazy and dead inside.

There are a lot of good books out there that tackles this. You can also find free audio books on it on YouTube too. “The Happiness Trap” and “Dopamine Nation” are two recommended books.

Some people fill their void and what’s missing through money, fame, and other things that ultimately are never ending. 

1. I would start with doing activities outside of your routine slows your mind down and being mindful of just “existing”. Meditation is mastery of the mind and it’s chronic impulses. Look into practicing they intently daily. Sam Harris has good meditation practices.

2. Mindfulness activities could include not “thinking chronically”. Hiking (nature), swimming, running are a few examples. 

3. Removing toxic activities that messes with your dopamine rewards system. Chronic social media usage or games. (Professor Adam lembke “dopamine nation” on YouTube or her books addresses it”). Your brain is in a state of wanting more constantly.

4. It could very well be a genetic thing or ptsd for
 Childhood that’s creating this chronic need to succeed. A lot of “successful” people have this and seem to be successful on the outside but quite miserable. It took them time to be self aware and address it. They filled in their void with other things that made them more content. See YouTube interview stories on Chris Williamson or Doctor Chatterjee.

5. It’s a complex issue. But practice self love and compassion. You’re very young and it is amazing that you are finding out how to address these complexities early on. Depression is very tough — find ways to address that first (exercise is a powerful tool)

I hope you find strength on your journey and overcome your struggles."	JustPoy	reply	na	na	na	0.9988110065460205	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealth

"Even if it's very unlikely that you would harm that person, the pain you feel is a problem you should deal with.

Switch off screens 1h before going to bed and read a book in bed instead. Force yourself to do this early like say 9 or 10pm. The earlier you go to bed, the better the sleep quality, even if you sleep the same amount of hours as going to bed late. Get some comfy high quality sheets and pillows, ear plugs, and either a blackout window or a sleep mask. All of these take a few days to adjust to but stick to it at least for a week. Good luck!

"I wish I could give you some advice. I've tried following all the different advice - the only thing that's really truly worked for me is to take care of my health and also go with it. If I can't sleep, instead of fighting it, use it as time to practice mindful meditation, or to get something done I've been putting off because if I can't sleep anyway I figure I might as well be productive so that when I CAN sleep that I don't have stuff in the back of my mind that I ""should"" get done before sleeping.

I eat relatively healthy, I get lots of exercise, I do use lots of screentime in general, but not everyday and my use of screen or not screen doesn't seem to be a major factor.

I've heard of a sleeping method not exactly sure how it works but basically you need to sleep for 20 min every 4 hours that might help with the exhaustion . Or what ive found that works for me is basically lie down on the bed clise your eyes and start taking very deep breaths trough your nose usually it takes me a min to drop like a log	GamingCanuck0	reply	na	na	na	0.9994088411331177	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealth
"As you probably know, it's important to address the cause of the insomnia.  
  
The famous Mayo Clinic has an insomnia article. It says that simple behavioral methods are as effective as pills."	GamingCanuck0	reply	na	na	na	0.9994088411331177	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth
"Pills have side effects and a high risk for dependence. Sleeping medicine isn't a long term solution. Usually sleeping problems are a symptoms of an underlying medical or mental health illness. It's best to try CBT-I for insomnia which teaches best practices on sleep, such as consistency in going to bed and getting up as well as restructuring negative thoughts or ANTs about sleep. With the CBT program one can reduce and eliminate sleeping pills and retrain the body to gain effective sleep. When sleep is restored many other issues tend to resolve as well. Sleeping issues can persist for years and cause other medical illnesses, always prioritize sleep, but do not sleep in or nap when practicing a routine to restore sleep. 

I've tried ambien. One of the worst drugs out there. The max dose was the only effective dose and it only worked for a week. Then I was getting 3 hours of sleep with the pill and zero hours without it. I had cognitive side effects, whether I slept or not. 

I've tried benzodiazepines. They helped in the short term,,but in the long term they had me dependent on them for months. I became suicidal with the thought I was stuck on the junk forever. Thankfully I got off of them.

Most psychiatrists will prescribe either an atypical antidepressant such as mirtazepine or trazedone which works for most with minimal side effects or doxepin which is also an a typical antidepressant. If depression is the cause of unipolar depression, a doctor may prescribe an SSRI or SNRI. If the case is of bipolar depression, a mood stabilizer may be added or used in place of an antidepressant. 

I am not a doctor and highly suggest you see one for any medical advice. Do not take any prescription medications without doctor approval of supervision"	GamingCanuck0	reply	na	na	na	0.9994088411331177	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth
"I am currently 15 and have been living with really bad paranoia most of my life, I can barely sleep sometimes because of it.   


Most of my paranoia thoughts are surrounding people trying to harm me out of no where, something chasing me, something looking at me when I don't know they're there. Some of my thoughts I feel are broadcasted to my entire high school. There's nights where I'm in a paranoid state for 6 hours and get no sleep because of it.   


I struggle going outside because of it. Even when I go to the park which is filled with very sweet looking people I can't help but think they are working against me or trying to kill me. When I go to the store with my family my paranoia is elevated even more and I think the entire store is trying to kill me. I've been too scared to get a haircut too because I think the barber is trying to kill me too.  


I don't know what to do or who to go to. Any advice would help me. Thank you."	Ninity-_-	post	10.750248883104376	male	White	0.99818354845047	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth

"Maybe it's out of place to say but have you considered that your mental health issues didn't cause your change in appearance, but rather both problems are caused by the same underlying issue? 
Because if all of this happened suddenly (instead of slowly over the normal course of aging) I'd suggest getting a blood panel or something done to be safe.   

That said, overall taking care of yourself will boost your appearance. Drinking more water and sleeping more will help with darkened eyes. Skin care helps with preventing more wrinkles and a retenoid (which can often be prescribed for free depending on your location) is one of the only topical treatments to reverse wrinkles and other signs of aging.

And remember, you're probably being way tougher on yourself than anyone else would be. Most people aren't taking a magnifying glass to our appearance and making comparisons the way we tend to do in the mirror. Focus on what you can change and take care of yourself!"

"I’m getting ready to turn 22 in two months and it feels like everyone around me’s had major accomplishments and have their dream life, starting up families with money in tow from their nice jobs. I’m still stuck at home struggling to keep myself afloat and my mental health is the lowest it’s ever been. I’ve been told I’ve been acting different, but I don’t feel like I have, so I try to be my normal self but worry that I’m not meeting expectations or something. I end up not speaking as much as I used to. I haven’t felt like myself for a while either, I used to feel like I could find a purpose in my life, but I sorta don’t anymore.

But at the same time I want to find my purpose soon so I can just like a more stable life and be happy again. I feel so hopeless in life, I want things to go dark so I don’t have to deal with this constant feeling. It feels like everything is crashing down harder and harder as the years go by, I can’t stand this feeling of constant dread."

"I'm going through the same thing. 20m here, and yeah haven't figured shit out. One thing that has been helping is weirdly enough setting goals even tho I don't have any actual goals. I'm working for this company and it may be in my field of work but it still feels like I'm not getting anywhere and that life is unreal but when I feel Im not working to anything I ask myself where I see myself in 5 years with what I'm doing now. So in 5 years time I hope to see myself as a the head social media manager at my company and making stunning advertisments for them to boost the business, and that I hope to have some peace of mind with my mental health. 

Discovering who we are in life takes time, and we are ever changing how can we say who we are now if we change so frequently. So I set my goals and identify my sense of self vaguely until I find the things that I truly feel passionate about. And when that changes so will my goals so will my identity.

"So I'm also 22, and I went through something like this two years ago and what really broke me out of it is that I found out that I didn't really have to fulfil some great purpose? I don't work in a job that is my purpose in time but I enjoy small things about it and it pays me and it's a means to find other interesting things. Living with my parents was making me miserable so I worked to earn enough to move out, but that took a long time and in the meantime I just tried to give value to the things I did. What really made it sink in for me was I went through a really suicidal period and this one girl was my friend and in a few conversations that she may not have realized the significance of she changed my whole worldview and helped me work on getting better. And I realized that even if I wasn't changing the whole world or becoming some crazy successful person if I could help someone like that that would be a LOT. Even if I couldn't change a whole country I could make up one additional number at a protest. And that helped. 

Idk about you but I was also really depressed, and when I was working on getting past it I used to wish to get really bad again, and constantly dread when things were good cuz I was scared that it'll just get really bad when I was starting to be hopeful. Therapy helped. So did talking to people so they knew when things were bad rather than me disappearing or just being disconnected. I could just say I needed space. I also realized that that feeling kinda comes and goes, and instead of falling to rock bottom whenever things get bad, I just try to accommodate it and treat myself kindly until it passes. Cuz it does pass. 

&#x200B;

Also, sometimes it's hard to decide on fixed goals cuz we change so much as the years go by. I've just taken to identifying things I enjoy and can do well or want to do well at the moment and working on those. Some people know where they want to go in life, others do different things and eventually the dots in life connect. At least that's what I've seen in my experience of those around me.

"I (17) have always been close to my dad. He is always there for me and has helped me a lot with my mental health issues during high school. My mom on the other hand has is different. We have always seemed to have issues and in general a difficult relationship. She always screams when she wants me to do something and she always complains about me being lazy. 

Now to the main problem, 3 weeks ago I went on summer break and my mom wanted me to travel. We went back to her home country and there’s where we are now. It has been really bad, she always complains that I’m lazy, that I don’t clean, that I don’t do anything and that I don’t want to do anything. I’m going to be honest now, I don’t want to do anything. I have been working my ass of in school and I just want to be myself, I want to be lazy, I want to read and write.  She doesn’t know anything about me and when we try to have a conversation she can’t even keep up. She always says “oh I didn’t know that” I’m tired of having her 30% in my life, she’s never interested in how my life is going and she doesn’t want to know. My mom isn’t white and she has had her struggles but she doesn’t need to guilt trip me into thinking I owe her cleaning services. I always help around at home and she even asked me to vacuum today and I did it. I really need guidance because I don’t know what to do. She just doesn’t like me she never has and I really want my mom to be my mom. Like the real mother that cares for you and loves you and wants to know more about you. I am a first generation of immigrant, and I do understands my parents struggles in the new country but now it just seems unfair. Why doesn’t she respect me? Why am I not a person in her eyes I know she can be nice and loving, but I just have never gotten that from her

Today we had a big fight, and it left me in tears. After that I had a panic attack and she asked me do you think you’re a good daughter right now?  What the fuck does that even mean?

"Title is self-explanatory. 

The past few years have been very rough on me. 

It feels like I'm just existing. It's impossible to put in words, but every day, it feels like I'm floating. It's like I'm observing everything I do, instead of actually doing it.

The strange thing is, I'm amazingly skilled at hiding it. Around others, I put on an extremely joyful and positive facade. I'm terrified to show this internal side of me to others, for fear that they'll think I'm weird, leave me, or have a permanent thought of me as an unstable freak. I used to be comfortable opening up to my closest friends, but now, I can't even do that. 

I'm tired of acting like everything is fine. I'm tired of forcing myself to act okay. I wish that, for a while, I could just be somewhere where absolutely ***no one*** is, so I could finally just, be myself.

Last year I was in a relationship that I described as the “light at the end of the tunnel”. I had been just so depressed and lost before finding her really felt like, nice, all the pain and suffering finally something good. And it was so good. However the relationship lasted only 3 months and another 3 months of a toxic connection that hurt me deeply.

I’ve done a lot for myself after cutting her off. I’m in great shape running every weekday, travelled to Asia, climbed a mountain, trying standup. However it’s times like this where I think, am I happier than I was last year? Canada Day we said was one of the best moments we shared together. This year there’s no way I can get anywhere near that high.

"I think it actually is ""curable"" depending on the type of mental illness you're dealing with.

Schizophrenia? High-level Bipolar (type 1)? Psychopathy? maybe there is no way to fully cure these illnesses and ones alike.

However, when it comes to general depression, anxiety, and behavioral issues alike, I do believe that intensive therapy and reframing of one's way of thinking will eventually ""cure you"".

I speak from experience, as my entire personality has changed during my two (ongoing) years of therapy. I am not completely where I want to be yet, but I am for sure a different person and can see myself ""cured"" by the end of my therapy, some day in the future. I no longer have the wild, crippling anxiety or intense behavioral issues (throwing angry fits in the midst of panic, breaking things etc). Things can change A LOT.

However, one place you are absolutely wrong is that it ""isn't healthy to have hope"". Look, I know life is rough and unfair, but one thing I can promise you is that if you do not have hope - you will never make it. You need to hope, and you need to believe in yourself, because if you don't, you have no shot. This is an important part of the formula. 

And yes, proper treatment can be a little difficult to come by, but what you need to do is keep hopping therapists until you find one that you really like and trust a lot. I have been through about 5 different therapists (they all sucked) until I found the 6th which I am working with now, and she is absolutely the best, most compassionate, smartest person I have ever worked with.

The symptoms can be greatly reduced. I have OCD but other than minor things I was almost OCD free for about 3-4 yrs. However my OCD manifested itself as social anxiety instead. Certain practices and lifestyles can avoid triggers and make the problems with your mental illness reduce. Sometimes this can be therapy for someone who maybe has minor symptoms or for more drastic illnesses like schizophrenia usually medication is needed.

"I actually used to think similar to this.

Problem is not trying only makes you worse. In my case it was a couple of decades later and it's been horrific.

Difference is if you spend the time trying to understand you and working out what can actually help you can make life much more bearable and actually functioning.

It's hard work and after thinking it wouldn't be worth putting the effort in and being defeated by the thought  my life has pretty much changed round in a 180.

my life has just taken a dump on me recently, and i was just thinking about how i’m not ready to get better yet. i literally feel like i’m just laying down in a pit and looking up at the sky, but i can’t get out yet. i think it’ll take something extreme to happen to me for me to try and make a change though. i just don’t care enough right now to get better. i’m fine with feeling awful right now? i don’t understand. i obviously don’t want to feel so lost, but i can’t take the steps to get better right now.	sumsumouuu	post	23.508685058382298	male	White	0.9988651275634766	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
"People are amazed at how easy the steps can be. The key is small steps.  
  
I can tell you some self-help things but I'm not saying necessarily that these are all you need. Treating a serious case of depression with nothing but self-help is risky.  
  
  
A famous psychiatrist, Abraham Low, said that when we can't control our feelings we can still control our muscles. If you tell your arms and legs to get you out of bed, they will obey. Count down from 10 and at zero, move with all your might.  
  
  
Try this when it seems that you're too tired to work. Lie on the couch, close your eyes, and get ready to work by imagining yourself working for 5 minutes. Think in terms of taking it step by step and starting with something really easy.  
  
  
Taking things in baby steps - very important. This is the key to motivation and motivation is the key to recovery.  
  
  
Just 20 min of brisk walking a day can help, and you can add to that gradually so long as you don't make yourself sick of exercise with too much.  
  
  
This is a motivation trick that's been used in behavior modification programs since the 1930s. If a task seems like it's too big, think of it as a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time, and start with something really, really easy. Cleaning - start by cleaning for 3 or 4 min and take a 5 min break. Homework - start by proofreading a paper or previewing a chapter you're going to read by looking at headings, sub-headings, etc.  
  
  
You can even use the baby steps principle for having fun. If you're not getting any enjoyment out of things, here's something people here have said is helpful with that problem. Look all over and do a complete inventory. You should be able to find at least one or two things you like, such as your favorite music or movie. If there's just one movie you like, watch it once or twice. Then, find movies that are like it in some way - with similar story or the same actor. Keep adding to your entertainment supply to give it variety.  
  
  
If you're thinking about professional help, treatment usually begins by seeing the GP, who can give you a referral. I mention referral because just a bottle of pills is not a very good approach. The things you'd want to tell the doctor are how you feel at different times of day, any symptoms you might have such as change in appetite or sleep, and things in your life affecting how you feel.  
  
  
If you're depressed, I can't tell you exactly what you need. There's no one size fits all solution. I can tell you though that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits.  
  
  
Video, below - details about self-help based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and lifestyle choices that help with depression - nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise, and social support, also traditional Asian methods.

"Regardless of how a person frames things in their mind, facts are still facts. You can reframe something and feel better about it, but in the end I don't see how that changes facts or the reality of your individual situation. Whenever somebody brings up the idea all I can think of is how it's distracting you from the actual issues at play. 
For a prime example I look at stoicism, which at one point was very helpful for me at the time, but at a certain point you're forced to confront the fact that the external forces you cannot control, still control you to a large extent. Here in Canada I'm looking at the rising cost of living and the fact that both my generation, and the one before mine were completely fucked by generations before mine. My generation will never own a home, nor will millenials, and probably not generation alpha either. The majority of us are living paycheck to paycheck, and inflation is making things significantly worse. No amount of cognitive reframing will fix any of this. 
Personally I think the idea of cognitive reframing was thought up by people from a different generation who are out of touch with how things are today. It's a distraction from the real issues in the world that we need to stand up against. Stoics will tell you to ignore these issues, but if history has taught us anything it's that when a large number of people are fed up with the state of affairs and do something, we can change the unchangeable.
Cognitive reframing is doing little more than telling people to accept a shitty reality when we could be doing something about it. It's an idea that only serves the rich and powerful. It's manipulative at best and brainwashing at worst. I would love to just ignore how the world is sprinting towards it's doom and reframe it as something positive, but that doesn't help society at large, nor is it particularly helpful to me as an individual. It takes your attention away from the corruption in the world, which is exactly what the corrupt want you to ignore.
 I'm sure there's plenty who will read this and say I'm just playing the victim mentality here. I'm not. I'm genuinely curious how anyone can rationalize that reframing the truth into some sugarcoated view of the world helps anybody. It's absurd to me"	Major-Dragonfruit-52	post	21.866680816258093	male	White	0.9992843270301819	na	na	na	2	MentalHealth

"Once you see it, you can't unsee it. Those that speak up are told they're mentally unwell. Those that choose to fight get hurt or worse. Those that join sell their soul and become the 1%. Western World children are indoctrinated from the moment they can think. Paths chosen for them. If you become sick you're now part of the healthcare system for LIFE. Those that can afford get well.
Why do you think suicide rates are so high? Why is depression so prevalent? Freedom is there for those that were either chosen by the system or give themselves to it....at ANY cost.
I've seen men and women hurt their own families to become part of the 1%. Any coincidence that those who speak up are often 'silenced'? Never mind the horrors that you see on the evening news. The true horrors of humanity are played out Every. Single. Day behind closed doors by a select few in government buildings. 
I have the unfortunate upbringing of watching a family member destroy his own family through spite, just because he could. I've watched them manipulate a government system to keep young talented men as slaves via drugs, debt traps, gambling, addiction... whatever it takes to keep them on the Merry go round. The harsh fact is, the 1% will protect what they have via ANY means possible.
So why don't people see it? The screen in front of your face blinds you from it. 'Keep them sick, keep them blind, keep them depressed, keep them fighting for something they'll never get'.

"As a self aware person, I believe I intellectualize my emotions because it feels better. For the most part, I can understand why I have certain feelings/where they come from. I always seek labels because it helps me compartmentalize whatever I’m feeling and “put it on a shelf”. 
The thing that has been concerning me lately is the fact that I have been lashing out. While feeling empty and like a void, I get triggered and angry. For example, the other day my boyfriend said “idk fine wbu” when I asked him how he slept, and I started a whole fight. So much yelling, I threatened to leave him, even though I don’t want him to leave me…after a while of being angry I felt like I was back in my body and I realized how terrible that was of me, and I had no basis to get mad on.

"I’ve had as much as I could take of life. I wish I could give up the ghost. Not trying to make this a sob story. However I had a traumatic childhood growing up. I was severely beaten and my mom kept me ISOLATED from society (emphasis on isolated). So to no surprise I’m socially awkward. While keeping me locked in a room she never interacted with me so I don’t know how to live life. She never allowed me to do anything. All this up until the age of 17 when I took the first opportunity I had to jump ship to live with my father. 

By this time all of that was engrained into me. Fast forward to when I was 27 it bothered me that I might live the rest of my life without any social skills, kids, or family. No one of my family has ever called or checked on me. I’ve had thoughts of suicide and told my family and asked if they could please call me, check on me, and let me know that they were at least thinking of me. My family didn’t care and just gave me a blank start. 

I’ve never been able to form friendships on my own or maintain them. However by way of chance I finally met someone who meant me more good than anyone I have ever known family included. They were basically teaching me the way of life, standing up for myself, that it was every human beings basic right to be treated as a person, and just everything in general. He also did things my dad didn’t like protecting me. My mom has 3 kids and my dad has 13, I say that to say I never had anyone that would cover for me or protect me in a time of need. Prior to meeting my friend I was used to men being able to hit me with no repercussions. My dad was the one who never did anything when I was threatened by a man.

Everyone hates me especially my dads children’s. They hate that he had additional kids  I get the brunt of that stick. They went behind my back and ruined my friendship that I had with my dear friend. I will say me and this friendship was rough at times due to childhood traumas and CPTSD. However outside of that we were thick and thin. That being said now I am back to the drawing board and I’ve had absolutely no one. I believe at this point it is impossible to live life. He was really a rare commodity and a now almost 30 year old woman won’t find anyone that will teach her."

Obviously who would wish pain on others, but the thing is I feel like I can’t care for others I just don’t have it in me. It feels slightly sad knowing I’m not normal in this way - I don’t know, I watch films seeing how characters are motivated by their friends etc. and in my personal life I don’t feel it.

 I feel a weird type of pleasure seeking people to be mad at me when it aligns with the dislike I have for myself, like being rejected, being seen as unattractive etc. I recently went into a relationship and we ended it off as friends because everything I felt felt real but only as a performance, I wasn’t using them but I felt an absence of a real feeling during the time I convinced myself it was real.

I try and find information online and from what i’ve seen it’s meant to be a coping mechanism, but it feels like a part of me, since I was a child. Any insight would be appreciated."	cannotstopwhining	post	18.356586789306178	male	White	0.992954432964325	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
"It sounds more like a defense mechanism.

You like it when others attack the same parts of you you already dislike because it's reassuring. You've probably hated those parts of you for so long that getting external confirmation is gratifying. If that self-hatred is related to a reoccurring experience you had when you were very very young (like a parent always critizicing you over the same thing) then it can also feelgood since you're recreating a dynamic you know well.

As for feeling nothing about others. A simple observation to make is that your mental health seems to be in such poor condition that it's natural to struggle to care for others. Imagine you just broke on of your legs. It's not very likey that you're gonna be immediately taking care of someone else's wound, is it? Your whole body and mind would be screaming at you to take care of your leg!

And also, if you did care about someone else on an emotional level, then *if* they betrayed you, failed to meet your expectations, or hurt you in any other way, you'd, well... Get pretty hurt, wouldn't you? So in that sense not caring about others is a shield to protect your probably fragile emotional balance.

But as you can probably guess  that's not a good way to be. On an existential level because feeling truly connected to another individual or feeling like you truly belong in a group or community brings a kind of warmth, colorfullness, and joy to life that is simply priceless and life without that is waaay worse. And also on a general-health level since poor mental health leads to worse overall health and more health complications like auto-immune diseases.

Best advice I can give you is to do what you need to get therapy and stick to it. You already identified and analyzed your main problems, and hopefully i've explained just how bad this is for you.

"I’m not a doctor.  Obviously changing/ getting off  meds is a serious thing and should be managed by your doctor.  Reading about these drugs- lamotrigine treats bipolar and seizures, and may lead to the blahs but if its helping with bipolar that might be better.  

Duloxetine treats depression and balances serotonin and norepinephrine which is a good thing for depression and it’s suggested to try it for 6 months before switching.

Hydroxyzine - an antihistamine that treats anxiety, this could be causing some issues, as it can make you drowsy and decreases brain activity.

"Real age: 25f. I'm trying my best to be more mature and act like a genuine adult but I'm still mentally stuck at 16/17. Funny enough when I was actually 16/17 I was stuck around 13/14 due to severe isolation and lack of socializing growing up.

But now I've been stuck there since... well seems like forever. Like I finally have a genuine real job, have been living in a real apartment by myself for the last 3 yrs, and am working towards going back to drivers ed.

This just... Sucks. I feel so behind everybody my age and I know it has everything to do with what happened to me around that age bracket, seems like I've been stuck ever since. But I'm honestly am genuinely trying my best. It just never seems enough. I mean, Obviously I am going to continue doing it regardless of how defeated I feel every fricking day because I Have to. If I don't then what? I won't be able to look after my little brother let alone be a reliable adult he needs in his life, when the day comes of course.

"You have to be more gentle w yourself. It's okay and it's normal to feel behind or to feel uncertain. You just have to acknowledge how far you have already come, even if it's very small steps you should still celebrate/acknowledge them. 

Don't compare yourself to others too, it just makes your situation worse. It makes you become less appreciative of the steps you are taking, and then you might rush yourself or hyper-analyse your life, which it seems you are doing now. It just creates unnecessary self-judgement and dissatisfaction.

Another thing is that everyone goes about life at their own pace, it's fine if you feel as if you're behind but you really aren't, because you are taking the steps to accomplish becoming what you presume makes you an adult. And if you are mature enough to take those steps, and you are actively fighting then you are adult enough, and you are certainly not behind. There is not one set pace for how people live their lives, everyone goes about it differently and makes common achievements at different ages/periods in their lives. It all depends on what they've been through and what has influenced them. 

Especially considering that you're recovering from past experiences and trauma, which takes A LOT of time, it is very good that you are taking the steps now. It is more commendable than you think that you're actively working towards building a better life for yourself and your brother too. 

It's really never too late to make positive changes within your life and yourself, you just have to be patient with yourself and be happy with what you've done so far. You're being the bigger person, and you have already taken extremely significant steps and it's just going to take progress to get to where you want to be.

"Could be any number of things, but the most common explanation would be something like emotion dysregulation associated with short term adjustment from moving home. Transitions can be really difficult, even if you don’t expect change to be hard because home is familiar. However, if the symptoms persist or worsen, then it could be related to something else. Depression can often manifest as irritability rather than sadness, and is often associated with sleep trouble and fatigue.

The real answer is that no one here, including me, can accurately diagnose you. The smartest thing you can do is seek out a psychological assessment. You can go to your primary care doctor for a checkup, tell them your symptoms and ask for a mental health referral, or go straight to a mental health clinic that offers comprehensive psychological assessment services. These are often covered by insurance.

You’re smart enough to know that you want to change how you’re feeling and behaving, and you have the courage to ask for help here. That’s good. The next step is asking for help from a professional who can work with you to make some meaningful changes in your life.

Hope this helps."	beeeiiia	reply	na	na	na	0.9994977712631226	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth
I’m still a kid but I know I have bpd. I don’t want it. I want to live a normal life with friends and family. How can I get rid of bpd. I start high school soon and I want to be able to make friends and get good grades. I have been to 14 mental hospitals and none of them have helped so is there any other way I can get rid of bpd. I don’t have friends or much family and I live with my dad and 2 siblings. I do go to a therapist but it doesn’t really help. I also take lexapro and seroquel but they don’t do anything.

Has anyone ever shown you your  good qualities.  They often miss pointing these out. Sure  we have big emotions but when you understand who you are I find they get a bit easier to manage and deal with. And also friends that aren't judgey.

"I don't feel like myself, and I don't mean that like an idiom that expresses that I am experiencing negative feelings that make me look bad.

I feel like I lost a significant part of my life, or who I am. Like I am literally not being myself because I lost a trait to my personality, or I lost a part of my life. This feeling is making me very, very stressed out and I am conscious of this feeling. I have a deep sadness accompanied with this feeling. I have not lost anything that is a major part of my life. If anything, my life has gotten better.

I've experienced changes. I stopped smoking 6 months ago, for instance. I haven't really craved nicotine for a while, but this feeling has Made my nicotine cravings come back like it's my first week quitting. I moved, but my partner and our pets and all our things came with us. I am in the same town. I went back to school, and I left the restaurant industry for desk jobs (probably temporary) about 6 months ago. I've become dependent on my parents again because of school. I've changed some perspectives I have on life and feel like I view the world much differently than before. Most of these things are positive, or presumably so. 

I cannot shake this feeling that I am neglecting a significant part of who i am. Like I've left an important part of myself behind, or like a piece of my life is gone. I feel deeply sad and confused. I feel like I am doing something or living in a way that goes against my ""identity."" I am also feeling deeply nostalgic in a stressful way. Like I want to live in the past which, mind you, was way more stressful than now. 

Are there any ways to describe this so I can do some research?"	NelsonisNelson	post	19.308618712830565	male	White	0.9968369007110596	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth

I remember alot of things about the way I acted as a child. More so then my parents as I often kept to myself. I remember that when I was little I really loved animals. I would often want to keep any injured cat I found and help it or just want animals in general. But the big problem was I would hurt these animals and never knew why. As far as I remember my parents never absused animals. And no they did not abuse me. And my love for animals would blind everyone to the fact that I actually hurt them and I was trusted around them so my parents never knew until I told them when I was way older. I remember hitting my cats and throwing them down the stairs and I even almost drowned my puppy a few times on purpose trying to give him a bath. It felt like an impulse thing because I would remember crying about doing it but I wanted to keep doing it :(. And now I'm older I feel so disgusted with myself as a child for what I did to our pets that Im deathly scared of my now child doing it to our current animals. I keep a close eye on her and try to teach her about respecting animals but I'm afraid she'll sneak at night or be super sneaky about it in general like I did. I never grew up to be homicidal or anything and was never diagnosed with anything other then ADHD. But now that I look at the past and current events myself and others speculate that I could be Autistic because of the way I act and feel amongst other things and plan on going for a diagnosis. Is that maybe why I abused my animals? Could there be another reason? Is there a way I can prevent my kids from doing it to our animals if they ever start? As of right now my love of animals is still great and I do not abuse animals anymore nor do I want my fur babies getting hurt by my kids.	meggapoi	post	25.95236467337827	female	White	0.020245742052793503	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
"same.. I was pretty empathetic as a kid. I would get attached to any creature, and try to care for it but my parents had me stay with a family during the day as care givers, it was only me and their older son. after some pretty brutal bullying that I mostly won't remember I was stewing in periodic feverish rage attacks. insects and small animals were frequent victims.. I was too hateful back then to be sorry but as I grew older I became deeply ashamed

self loathing makes everything worse, so the path to coming back is by accepting where we are, what we went through left a mark. it wasn't our fault, but we still must take responsibility to be able to forgive ourselves and shed ourselves of our shame through the work that will redeem our relationship with ourselves. once we've forgiven ourselves for what we did while after being compromised by such influence.. we are doing better for the sake of ourselves and others and the small beings we've harmed on the way

daily morning practices of gratitude to hunt the good. finding sources of wholesome joy to focus on -- the magic is in the genuine feeling of it, so we do not stop until we have this. it may take some time in the beginning so we must be patient... but it's like working a muscle. an evening mediative introspective practice of patience compassion and no judgment, practicing this towards the self and others.. being mindful and present to not indulge darker thoughts. do not fear darker feelings, catch them, recognize them for what they are -- darkness is absence of light. so embrace them and guide them to feel better without harming others with the wholesome thoughts they need, don't stop until you have the correct antidotive feeling for whatever transgression we manage to catch"	meggapoi	reply	na	na	na	0.020245742052793503	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealth
"  
  
I'll cut to the chase because I really need some guidance here on how to manage my girlfriend's condition.  
These diagnosis has been confirmed by a psychiatrist here in Sarawak, Malaysia.   
  
  
She has :   
  
1. Depression: She would randomly fall into depression anytime she feels alone (most frequent reason and it has been observed to be true) therefore to remedy this, she goes out every single day to shop for clothes , eat at cafes, and frequent a bar that my aunt's best friend owns (to mostly listen to music, play pool, karaoke)  
  
  
2. Schizophrenia (Hear's voices if surrounding is too quiet, telling her she's not good enough/should harm herself for being useless. To drown these voices out, she constantly listens to music on high volume).  
  
3. Anxiety: She gets super anxious if there is a stampede level amount of people in locations such as ballrooms etc so there is a limit to how much she can tolerate .  
  
The deadly combo: Depression and Schizophrenia,  Everytime she feels alone , she would freeze up and experience both of these at the same time, it would start with an uncontrollable onset of depression followed by voices in her head telling her to harm herself / not good enough / no point in staying alive.  To DROWN these voices she self harms . She would cut lines on her wrist with a pen knife until she feels ""calmer"" . According to her, seeing blood on her wrists makes her calm , it stops the voices (she claims the voices would be overpoweringly annoying and she thinks the only way to drown them out would be to cut herself which she claims bring relief.  
  
  
I'm at a stage where I'm constantly spending time with her nearly everyday skipping important errands which is unsustainable and disuptive to my life as well because I can't trust her to be alone. She seems to also be afraid of being alone too, but when she is , she would try to control symptoms with loud music to drown voices and if necessary she would take an emergency prescription called ""CLONazepam"" to supress her emotions etc and fall asleep.   
  
""Escitalopram"" is another prescription for her depression and anxiety. As well as another one to treat schizophrenia (forgot the name).  
  
She also seems to be suffering from chronic insomnia where she would be able to stay up to 48 hours if she's not taking her depression prescription (which also helps her sleep)  
  
The main problem I need help with is to find a way to help her manage her urges to self harm , lately it seems to be amplifying. Most of the time she takes her prescriptions and she would be fine, but there are days when she would feel a severe instant onset of depression+schizophrenia and the medication would be too late to stop her from the thought of self harming. A good example was yesterday when she was with me in my room and I fell asleep before her since she left her medication that helps with sleep at her home, she woke me up and told me she is experiencing extreme depression and she felt like self harming herself and she cried. I reassured her that I won't leave her side and would be there constantly to keep her from her urges, prior to waking me up , she took the emergency prescription ""CLONazepam"" which eventually kicked in and made her drowsy and she eventually fell asleep. Had I not been there she told me she would have 100% tried to cut herself. She told me the voices in her head was so annoying that she needed to cut herself to feel relief.   
  
So now you can see why this is a problem. Eventually I will find a job and I wouldnt be able to be present as often anymore. I need to find ways to help her manage the symptoms better and ultimately try to cure her onset schizophrenia because that seems to be the most debilitating part of her condition . It disrupts her life completely and she isnt able to work because of it.   
  
Despite all the consultations with psychiatrists (whom seem to be absoultely unexperienced and unprofessional) here in sarawak malaysia ,  she still feels these things. The only thing that works is her medication however the therapy part of her treatment doesnt seem to be effective. Previously during her first attempt to get professional help,  they would keep her in the hospital and restrain her for a few days because of the self harming.She told me the psychiatrists and staff were mostly rude to her and treated her like she was a crazy person. In therapys sessions , they would literally tell her not to  ""overthink about things"" as an advice which stunned me. She also was taught steps to help manage symptoms from a binder which she could not bring home so she would have to jot it down on her phone or something.  
  
  
(Extra background info)  
1. I onced rushed to her house with a first aid kit and just saw her sitting there non chalantly with her wrists filled with dried up blood from the cuts and acts like it's normal and she would like laugh when I took it seriously. She would tell me ""relax it's normal , everytime i cut my wrists i dont feel anything,it's just small cuts, I'm not gonna die or anything""  
  
2. We've only gotten together with her for 2 months , and i decided to be with her knowing her symptoms because I fell in love and I wanted to help her to get better but this seems to be taking a toll on me too as she would go out every single day and expects me to be there with her (not forced however but I would force myself to be there to accompany her to keep her safe as she only has 2 friends currently (whom are working and arent always available)  
  
3. She was raped by her own brother at 14 , her family members did not believe her claims. Now is staying with parents still but rapist brother is in another city. I told her to make a report but she didnt want to risk being disowned by her parents. She's currently 18, I'm 23.   
  
4. She also has a history of abusive exes (verbal abuse)   
  
5. She has a history of taking recreational drugs such as ecstacy and ketamine ( she stopped at the moment ) , so we're chinese and there are lots of chinese connections here in our hometown that deals drugs mostly at Karaoke Centers. Currently she stopped already but she still keeps in contact with those people. I adviced her to cut ties with these people but she doesnt want to. She told me she isnt confident that she cant completely stop it in the future if i ever am not around.   
  
6. Her family is aware of her condition but doesn't understand it therefore is often dismissive of her condition and considers it a burden and a waste of their time. (This is the most hearbreaking part)  
  
  
To anyone who's gone through the same thing and recovered or psychologists on this platform. I'm in desperate need of help to help my girl manage her symptoms. I'm really afraid of losing her . She has the kindest soul but she hides her pain constantly and she doesnt want to open up to others. But she has me now and I constantly remind her that she can talk to me about anything but it's still something she is working on . She constantly hides her pain and acts like everything is okay , makes jokes constantly but when she's alone that all changes. Obviously hiding it all in has been something she's been doing for years and it's definitely not healthy in the long run and it comes back with a vengeance anyways whenever she's in a state of loneliness and helplessness.   
  
I appreciate you guys in advance for any advice that you can give her . She doesn't know how else to seek help so I'm going to seek help for her. Money is also a constraint so I cant bring her to a more qualified/experienced  therapist/psychologist in another city yet but maybe in the future.

Incorrect. It isn't your place to help her. She has to want to seek help for herself. She needs your support and compassion.

"People seek help and change when they have something to lose. I know you want to help motivate her, but again, not your responsibility. You need to be cognizant of your mental health too. By playing the ""what if"" game with yourself ""if I help them find this, if I give them more time, if I say this"", you're enabling her to stay in her dark space. If you really want to help, you set a boundary. For example, ""I love you, and I am going to support you. I want to grow with you, not keep living through your pain. I need you to speak to your doctor and see if there are other options to help you heal that may work better for you, for us. You have a month to start taking more initiative regarding your health, as I can't see you sad anymore, otherwise, we will need to go our separate ways"".

"Kids are very mean for zero reason.
I am now in my 30’s and believe me, it does get better. 
Having been bullied myself for many, many years, I have come to the conclusion that the bullies were just unhappy people, trying to get happiness in making others feel like they do.
Best advice I can give you is to ignore them. Do not feed into it or give reaction to it. Makes them do it even more. 
Instead know that you are none of those things and that someday you will look back on these days and realize you made it, and that your life turned out much better than theirs. Hugs. 
You’re not worthless or any of the things they say you are. As far as being “bitchless” it is better to have respect for a woman and not refer to her as a Bitch to begin with, and it’s better to be single than be in a meaningless relationship every other month. The right girl will come along some day.

"I went through a hard break-up at the start of this year, the person out me through a lot and I was in a very bad place mentally at the time. A couple of friends that I have from school, I bonded with them after this break up, oneof the friends being their newly ex best friend. 

Life was so great from then on.

In March, I made the decision of asking a person out in this friendgroup who liked me. Everything was great, life felt good, I wasn't having many thoughts about Suicide, or SH, I was starting to eat again. Everything was going fantastic till May, to now. 

The person I was in a relationship with had realised that maybe they didn't have feelings for me, and that they had felt like this for a while. This absolutely shattered me, and it still is. Because we're on break and we just have to act like we're not being coupley and that hurts. 

This has caused me to feel depressed again, I have no motivation, I'm crying all the time, I want to hurt myself, I just want someone to hug me. I think back to my ex and if they had been right about all the nasty things they've said about me. 

I've failed to be happy, and everytime I'm happy I have a fear it's not going to last. I want to feel normal. I don't want to stay in my room anymore, I don't want to say no to hanging out because of the unbearable pain of still being in love with someone that probably doesn't want me back. 

I feel so alone and this friendgroup makes me feel alone."	WolfrickTheBread	post	22.711172006239593	male	White	0.9980377554893494	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth

Sometimes people who people please have experienced some sort of trauma that causes this -- may or may not be true in your case.  I read the exchange about boundaries and giving too much of yourself above.  Though it may hurt, try not to isolate yourself entirely and just trim the fat.  Take time to yourself to heal.  Then emerge again with a smaller circle of people who you hold close.  Only let people in that are respectful of your boundaries and feelings. Therapy can be helpful for those trying to identify a source of what is causing this need to overextended your kindness at your own expense.

"Sounds like you've been repressing your feelings of discomfort, resentment, anger, disappointment etc. for too long, maybe because you didn't feel safe enough to express them or maybe you never learnt how to recognize and express them before they build up too much, maybe as a way of people pleasing (idk if to avoid rejection or feel safer or be liked back etc.). And now they're catching up to you. 

Try to find healthy outlets to let your anger out.
Music, if you like listening to metal or sth. Working out or doing a sport could be another way. I know many people find running helpful, if you're able to do that. Depending on what you like to do and what you have access to, you can come up with more ideas.

And in the meantime, it's worth tying to pay more attention to your limits, boundaries, likes, and dislikes, and check out non violent communication to acquire tools to be able to say ""no"" in a healthy way to things that you discover to be crossing your boundaries. If you have access to it, talk therapy (preferably with an someone trauma informed or has experience with cptsd) can help too."	Selbear	reply	na	na	na	0.9987678527832031	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth

"When i was in 7th grade i was sexually harassed constantly. (btw i'm a boy and the students who did this were also boys) They would pin me down and slap my ass or touch me, others would call me pet names that made me uncomfortable, like cutie for example. I told my mom about this but she ignored me. You see,we used to live in an apartment but the neighbors above us would constantly be making loud noises, my mom would call the police on them or straight up argue with them.  When i told her they were touching me, we talked to the principal but she wasn't there, so we talked to the vice principal. I thought they would stop but they didn't. Instead of pulling me out, my mom kept telling me i wouldn't be there for too long. When i finished 7th grade, we moved to a house, and i went to 8th grade at a different school. I thought it would be better but it was worse.

The students at the new school did all the same things as the ones before, but in addition they would say racial and overall offensive slurs. Some students i worked with would come up to me and say they wanted to call me ""black squidward"" i heard arguing 24/7. Some kids were of Chinese descent and the students would call them ""Ching Chong Bing Bong"".  (the kids who did this were latino/black) This caused me to go into a depression, and my grandmother passing at the start of 2023 didn't help either. On our way there we had gotten into an argument, and i wanted to just jump out of the car and   let a truck hit me. When i told my mom this she said and i quote ""And then i would go to jail"".  You see when i would tell her how i felt she would say stuff like that. And it would make me angry, when i told her sometimes i feel like just punching a hole in a wall. She would say ""And i would knock you out if you did"". But she would also say that she didn't want to ""feel/ be seen as a bad mother"". But back to the school stuff, one day i was in the last class, social studies. We had a substitute teacher who had no idea how the students were. One of the students had shown me a video of himself jerking off on his phone. The first thing that the boys did when the teacher was out was throw stuff and play fight. 

It got so bad i had a breakdown. After school ended the school counselor had spoken to my mom about how bad the school was and put me in for home schooling. When we were heading back home, she was ranting about how the students just come to school for fun except for the FACT THAT I WAS TELLING HER THIS FOR WEEKS. And to top it all off after I finished home schooling, she was deciding which high school to put me in and she said ""I don't want to hear you complaining about this one either"" in a loud tone. Not a pleasant or nice tone but a mean tone. After that i started to resent her, i started to think and think. I wondered if she just wanted to make herself look like a good mother whilst not being one. I started to think that she just wants to believe what she thinks is right. 

It's summer break now, and right now i feel stuck. I don't know if i'm supposed to forgive her or hate her. I don't have any outlets that can help me release my anger except punching a pillow. I know i was venting but i also want to ask just what the hell am i supposed to do?"	Mission-Ad-8536	post	19.33017982619794	male	White	0.9987422823905945	na	na	na	4	MentalHealth

My parents wouldn't understand my reasons for not taking pills. I stopped taking medication without telling them and just pretend to take it now. I will never take medication again. But they want to watch me take it and make sure that I'm taking it and won't listen to me if I tell them that it's unnecessary and they are just confused (I don't blame them since they've clearly been tricked). They might take away my internet if I don't take them and it's really annoying. What can I say to them so they just stop annoying me about taking medication and leave me alone?

"Not the answer you want to hear, but if they want you to take your medication, maybe you need to be taking your medication.  

Nearly half of people with psychotic illnesses can't tell that they need to be taking medication.  They are blind to what the prescriptions are fixing and can only see/feel the side effects.  

Imagine if you had no sense of smell.  Other people would tell you to wear deodorant, and you would say, ""Why should I smear waxy stuff into my armpits?  Or doesn't do anything but make my armpits slimy.""

Has anything had happened to you on the past when you weren't talking your prescriptions?  Do you have anyone other than your parents who you could ask, ""Am I different when I take my prescriptions?  Better or worse?""

When my spouse doesn't take prescriptions, the delusions come back, my spouse starts drawing things and spending money, and sometimes the police have to come.

I've been dealing with mental health issues my entire life and I decided to get help this year and I've been on 4 medications (sertraline, mirtazapine, duloxetine and fluoxetine) so far with fluoxetine being the last antidepressant that I had tried. I had an appointment with my doctor last Thursday where I told him fluoxetine hasn't worked either and he had said that citalaprom was my final option and if that doesn't work, I had to battle my depression with no antidepressants because upon reflection by a psychatrist I was told that my depression was caused by intense trauma and what I need is therapy and not permanant antidepressants. While I'm not questioning both doctor's judgements or anything the thought of not having to take antidepressants leaves me in spot where I'm just plain depressed with no medication whatsoever to help me out. I have an appointment with one of my doctors on Thursday but meanwhile I can't stop thinking about having to battle depression without any anti-depressants so I was wondering if any of you redditors have been in the same position I've been in and/or offer me any advice on how to make my depression more manageable without any anti-depressants. Thank you and have a nice day.		post	48.76360914598371	female	White	0.0234516654163599	na	na	na	12	MentalHealth

"I'll talk about non-drug things that can help with depression, but I'm not saying meds are out of the question. There are drugs other than anti-depressants, and you can ask about that.  
  
Therapy can help. Therapists often recommend self-help.  
  
The beauty of self-help is that you have a variety of low cost, low risk things that can be combined with each other, and with standard treatments with office visits. While it's not clear at this time that any one of these things is as effective as an antidepressant, it's common sense that if a variety of reasonably good things are combined with each other, they will have considerable effect.  
I can't tell you exactly what you need. There's no one size fits all solution. I can tell you though that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits.

Everyone is different- I would recommend therapy (not everyone needs meds to help with their depression some people find a coping mechanism to distract themselves, and also it takes time ) I have some friends who are on anti depressants and when I would ask them if they would help they would say no. I’m struggling with depression with therapy and might get meds if I’m still struggling with them but imo I might be better without them ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm) I think I just depends of the person!!

"Medication isn't the cure for depression. It can help manage some of the symptoms but most of the time adds more symptoms.

I was on meds for a number of years and actually found I was doing less due to lack of motivation and energy even though this was a struggle beforehand it was amplified.

I hit absolute rock bottom a few months ago and since then came off the meds and actually started exercise.

The endorphins released from a good workout are much better than any medication I've been on (and I've been on loads) and my energy levels have soared through the roof.

It helps that I actually enjoy exercise but I'm pretty sure there's some exercise out there that you would enjoy if tried.

It's actually been so good for me that for the first time in my 45yrs of life I've actually shown an interest in going to college and learning for a job (gym instructor).

I (M29) was diagnosed with general anxiety and depression about 5 years ago. I really wasn’t feeling like depression was my issue, and felt that anxiety was primarily my problem. Originally I was prescribed antidepressants, and I knew pretty much immediately that it wasn’t helping. I told the psych and she prescribed me sertraline instead. This certainly didn’t make me feel as awful as the antidepressants did, but still didn’t really fix or even help my issues much outside of making me feel a little numb to the world around me. I took the sertraline for probably 90 days or so, but really didn’t seem to have any noticeable effect, and my anxiety was still riding hard. I decided I wasn’t going to just take pills if I didn’t feel like they were helping the issue. Fast forward to now, and I’ve had several friends suggest that I may have ADHD. From everything I’ve read, anxiety kind of tags along with a significant portion of ADHD cases. My focus at work is terrible a lot of the time, I tend to hyper focus on entertainment from video games, to sports, to movies, to shows, but otherwise have issues focusing, including with conversations in front of me and on the phone. My thoughts tend to overlap and often times I’m unable to finish a thought from start to finish. Am I crazy for thinking the docs maybe got it wrong?

"Not at all. ADHD is misdiagnosed all the time. GAD, depression, borderline personality disorder - you name it. Executive dysfunction can look like depression to those who don’t consider ADHD. Anxiety can also be due to masking and/or sensory overload.

I don’t know your sex/gender assigned at birth but AFAB people especially are misdiagnosed embarrassingly often because many psychiatrists diagnose on the ancient stereotype of a male toddler running around screeching all day.

Seek that assessment and educate yourself beforehand. Especially if your ND friends suggest it because I am of the firm belief that people with the same disorder are better at diagnosing you than half the psychiatrists out there, and I have diagnosed ADHD."

"I currently haven't tallked to anyone in about 3-4 years maybe more i don't recall when. This is a chain of event that happened to me that make me completly shut down to other humans. I never want to go out with friends, anyways the ones i had are brain blocked. I do not talk to my mom or any other members of my familly. I absolutely minimize all contacts with the wifes familly as well. Not dening them in my home but if i could i would. Used to have a nice group of friends we would go out and do many activities, less since everyone started having kids and stuff but we would meet up everynight or so online to game.
I've worked 15years with another group of coworkers which would keep me mentally sane cuz we would laugh and have fun during the day. Now i've just started a new job and it is not the same. Job itself is much less physical which is good but i don't think i am going to be able to redevelop the same stuff i had going on with my old coworkers friends. The only things i like to do is always alone. Anxeity, psychological blocage...

Thing is i've always been a super loyal person, and a chain of events came down to show me that nobody really cares about anybody when their backs are against the wall. And that really is disgusting what another could say or do to deflect. Even if someone would lie i could bring myself up to defend myself. I've took a very personal hit when one of my ex boss would suspend me when i had major healt issue (threw a blood cloth) because he would wait for a proof of diag from a heart specialist which i would see that often. I would miss a day of work here and there because of my kids, then for me, and he said he would wait for that paper no problem then the next thing i know he suspended me. And that's the kind of stuff that really throw me off line, having heart problems when he told me this i almost passed out and completely lost it in the office that day....i had a union representative that deserted his spot as soon as he witness that a few days later, so another curve ball. I think from there it went downwards. Healt wasn't good, had 3 kids shift work day and night in the same week, sleep wasn't really there, depression set in a bit more (always struggled a bit with depression tbo) . Then the DYP came in our lives, (we always take good care of our kids, they came in on a false alarm kind of thing), i wasn't in the best shape mentally and me abd my wife plan was just to be honest about everything and we thought that this was the good way to go, but we should've known better, they really came here to nail us down. And this is where the second event took place. My wife pinned evrything on me as soon as they put a bit of pressure on her, and me being me, i just could stand up for myself, and i was there in disbelief, shocked that my even my wife would do this to me...i fell alone in a really dark place, knowing that we had to go to court, talk to lawyers who actually didn't help us, i had a scketchy pass and was lucky enough to know people to get me out of there only to promess them to never get into the court system again, bad people but they were good to me in some sort of ways. And as a man you are not perceived very nicely into this DYP court system, i really started not to like womens, they were everywhere, in every meetings, at the courts...this was too much i think i fell into some kind of psychosis...at that point i stoped working due to financial, legal, mental, physcial healt, love...
i've blocked everyone. At one point i almost stopped talking, i wanted to stop talking i remember that. My anxeity at that point was throught the roof. I had an amazing doc that helped me out so much, he saw some stuff that i couldn't see on my own. Always asking the right question to bring myself to think about stuff. He saw that i had a really controlling wife, today, i know, she used to be very controling jealous of everything (and with 3 kids you don't have much time to yourself too so it's easy to look around you and envy others who have time), it would always be the end of the world if i'd go out even alone, fishing on my boat, or just out for one beer afterwork. Anyways, gaslighting, mental and emotional manipulator, she has a lot of narcissistic traits, but she would always make me feel like i am wrong or in the wrong. To this day, she is still quite a bit passive agressive, but she worked alot on her behavior. We went thought couples therapy and we both doing much better now then before. 

The DYP is out of our lives, the kids grew up, but 4-5 years after all of this here i am. Alone, not happy, not sad... can't stand other humans really... 

I personally feel like i've always pushed myself to fit it whatever situation or group of people and it really takes an insane amout of energy to thst every single day because there is no other i can be. And what i mean by fitting in as an example, i would absolutly go out of my way to learn a new skill, wether physical or social or psycological. I've always wanted to know everything and when i fall into something new, i am like a dog with a bone. I'm approching 40 and i've learned so many different things about so many subjects. I've also made projects/worked on many stuff it's crazy. I use this knowledge to help out and create some new relation with people, cuz i ain't too good at small talk and i absolutely hate gossiping judging so i guess it balances things out a bit. I catch on things whatever the subject is real fast. I am thankfull for that. 

After all these events when i look back i'm really trying to figure out what happened... i think i did a psychosis and it really changed me kind of thing. I had a brainscan durring that time period and i still remember the guys right after looking at the screen and they where kind of suprised and i've asked them if they've found something weird and they said ""there's a brain"" but i could see the other guys had seen somthing. so i went a couple weeks later and found out that my agmydalae compared to other brains was abnormal. Was it like this before everything, that i don't know.
I don't know if it's a psychological barrier or i am just like this now? 

i do still struggle with anxeity, with emotional control, and depression as always tho it is much much better now then it used to be when the kids were younger and everything else...

I am definitly not able to go into a group where we would share in person all these things and discuss etc etc...

"I (F34) have never really been that much of a sporty girl. When I was a kid, this wasn't really that encouraged, because sports of any kind would've been expensive and my parents never had enough money. So we usually just went hiking or biking sometimes in summer and there were some glorious summer holidays where we had access to a private swimming pool (long story), where we spent lots of time until it became too crowded for my dad. We also never really went ice skating or anything because again, too crowded for my dad.

I've been depressed a lot of times during my growing up, and I have another depressive episode at the moment. I've also got ADHD (got diagnosed three years ago) and social anxiety. I know doing sports would make me feel better. Some years ago I went to the gym regularly, but more out of necessity than because I enjoyed it. I never really got to the point where I enjoyed sports. Also, just deciding for any form of exercise seems really daunting and overwhelming. Like there's stuff you can only do in winter or summer, some things require different kinds of equipment and athletic wear is also overwhelming because there is so many different kinds and I never know what to get.

My husband was a triathele when we got together. He stopped for various reasons, but he started again some weeks ago. I know this isn't my thing, since I hate running and I never really got the hang of swimming or biking well. But I can't help but feel a bit jealous that he's got that thing he really likes, because I can't find that for myself. 

I just don't know how or where to start or what kind of sports to do. I also gained a lot of weight in the past two years and I want to get rid of that too.

It could potentially be an episode of psychosis, or delirium, but there are a lot of different things that might cause something like this. It could be related to a chronic mental illness, it could be caused by a medical condition, it could be caused by some kind of substance, it could be the result of extreme stress... It's hard to say what might be going on here.	mrrakim	reply	na	na	na	0.9983646273612976	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth
I never feel emotion the same anymore sometimes i will feel fine but i get almost physical emotion instead of mental emotion. If i’m speaking to someone and i could be abit nervous i don’t feel it but physically my voice will change and tremble or whatever abit i still don’t feel anything. Before an exam i felt fine but physically felt sick and shaken. I have no clue why. i still feel anxious or happy at times i don’t know why i only feel physical effects at other though.

"Dont know how to start, so ill just try to describe my issue. Im 13, and ive been dealing with intrusive thoughts and other OCD-like symptoms since i can remember. Lately, ive also started to, quite often, get ""episodes"" during which im just bored out of my mind, and feel like no matter what id do or would happen, it still wouldnt change, and i lack motivation to learn and/or do new things, even if i really want to. Another problem ive been dealing with lately are existential crisises. I think about what happens after death, why is the world the way it is, etc; which additionally caused enormous amounts of anxiety. What should i do? I know that i should probabbly go to a specialist, but i dont want my parents to have to pay for visits, or possible medication.

As context, ive been dealing with arythmia since the last 5 years. My parents regularily spend hundreds on my treatment, im unable to participate in any real sports, i barely go outside since i also have no real friends, and spend time on the internet 24/7. I dont want to add onto the expenses, but i fear that some day, this might lead onto something bad.

PS: I also remember once actually telling my mother about my possible OCD, but she has a more conservative view on things like this, and says that i probabbly dont want to land in a mental hospital."	A_random_redditor21	post	15.556587378177184	female	White	0.994940996170044	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth

"I don't know if this is the right subreddit but I need to know if this is normal.

Basically I was sleeping on the couch and I woke up, after a few minute I heard my name being whispered REPEATEDLY and each time it got slightly louder until my name was being screamed repeatedly, and it was all I could hear. Then it continued to be repeated but it got quieter and quieter and went right back into a whisper.

It WASN'T a dream OR sleep paralysis. I was wide awake, I was shaking and moving. I was looking around for the source and as soon as it started happening I sat up. It felt like someone was behind me and around me so I backed into the wall of the couch so I could see all around me, I had to urge to go into a corner. While it was happening I was looking EVERYWHERE for the source while freaking out because all I heard was my heart racing and my name being screamed. I was looking behind the couch, etc. But eventually I got so scared to turn my back to an empty room/space so I just sat there against the couch. 

Eventually, when it got quieter and quieter and went away I was just left with complete silence in the living room, other than me hyperventilating and my heart beating. I then turned on the TV after and just stayed up, so I know I was wide awake and fully aware during this whole time especially considering the adrenaline keeping me aware. 

My sister was also sleeping on the other couch and she was still fully asleep, so I don't think it was real. This was also quite a while ago, but I really wanna know, and because it was a while ago I don't remember if the voice was familiar, I don't think it was however because I feel like I might've realised. 

Also shortly after this sometimes I would just hear my name or like when I would be thinking in my OWN head, the speech would become distorted kind of or certain words would start to get repeated and I would feel really weird. This has all given me a weird connotation (I'm not sure what the word is) to my name. If I imagine my name being whispered I start to freak out or it just repeats slightly. It might just be me over thinking it, but sometimes I get incredibly scared to even say my own name when people ask. I don't like to say my own name AT ALL. Also when people scream my name I start shaking and I get goosbumps, I go into a fight or flight feeling.

So again, if anybody knows why this could be happening, or has any information or thoughts please let me know. "	FutureChicken2171	post	9.454413405542882	female	White	0.9844189286231995	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth

Sounds like you could do with an inspirational boost. I recommend Tony Robbins on YouTube. Might be worth making yourself get up and jog everyday at a set time. Ideally when you first get up. And do some juicing. Jogging is great for clearing the mind and getting clarity on what’s the next best step. You are so young and many of im us if not all go through a stuck period, unsure of what direction to go next. Take it as an opportunity to create something you love. Maybe you could start your own business online. Have a look at the kinds of things people do to make money. Make it fun.

"Hi,
I struggle with anxiety on a daily basis. The littlest things make me anxious and it builds up so much that by the end of the day I’m dead in bed crying with no real cause. I can’t actually pinpoint in those states what makes me anxious which means I can’t convey why I’m doing what I’m doing. It’s putting a strain on my relationship because I just can’t voice how I’m feeling. I want to be able to learn how to self soothe enough that I can talk about it and that I can work through my anxiety, hopefully one day without any help. What do you guys do to self soothe?  Work yourselves down after getting so worked up? Any method is a good method to try for me because at the moment I’m not doing anything at all.

"Lately my depression has been really bad for a few days now and it's just getting worse everyday. When I'm doing nothing it makes me think of alot of stuff and one of them is that. I can't see myself growing old, having a better life, and all. I see nothing if I try looking into my future. On other stuff, I've lost motivation to do anything. Like it's so bad I don't even want to eat anymore, I just wanna starve to death I guess. Stuff I used to enjoy, never really makes me happy anymore. I get no support from anyone even if I just need like a very tiny bit of it (cause I know they have their own lives too and aren't always free) but it feels like no one cares. Even though I always cared for them when they needed me. Sometimes I want to *attempt* again hoping it will be successful this time. 

There are still way more stuff that weighs me down. Like my parents. I know they've been always understanding to me but I feel like a burden to them now. I wanna start helping them but I still can't because of this stupid mental illness. Been 8 years and I'm still in college cause I had to stop before when it was really bad and I really cannot study, and honestly it's starting to feel that way again. I don't see myself graduating even if I look hard enough. I'm losing motivation to continue studying or even worse, continue living. 

This whole day has been really bad tbh I almost did *it* again but thought twice cause I don't wanna hurt people that I will leave behind, especially my parents. But that ""reason"" is slowly losing. I can't do this anymore guys. If ever something happens to me, I'm sorry. If ever my friends somehow sees this post, I'm sorry if I kept hiding this. I just don't wanna burden anyone.

Weeks ago they found a picture of me and my bf and they started to laugh bc they said I looked like one of his friends.

One of them made a STICKER of my fucking face.

My bf send to their group chat a drawing I made for him and one ☝️ f his friends said it was ugly. 

I already complain to my bf about this and he only told me that they don’t do that to make me feel bad, it’s just “humor” and they like to make fun of him, making fun on me bc I’m his gf(??????)

"What is and adult to you?

A Grumpy, serious person who is supposed to know everything what they do?

Most adults know nothing about what they do and why they do things .
And most adults are emotionally imature.
I don't believe the word adult "" really describes how a person supposed to feel or do things at any certain age.

But wisdom it is a whole another thing. And that comes with openess to experience life.
We experience life by making new decision and learning from the outcomes, by forming new relationships,  by failing, mistaking and succeeding.

Dont force yourself To feel older than you are because you are really young. You are not ""supposed"" to be anything other than who you are.

And guess what there will be many times in life when things will scare us..when we will feel vulnerable..No matter how old you are.

You feel young because maybe you are more honest than others who are just pretending to be something they are not.. grown-ups ..

If I were you would always see the world with the wonder of a young kid but with the wisdom that your age have provided you so far.

Things are in the right time and in th2 right place. There is nothing you need to be doing different. 
Dont think this has anything to do with covid..because it does not. I know because I have felt that way too when I was 18..

It is just part of learning, evolving becoming a new better version of yourself. 
Only you can decide what is the version of yourself you are ready for.
You cannot skip phases, because then you are not being your authentic self.

Hey pal, I’m 27, I’ll be 28 in September. I felt that way when I turned 18 too at first. And till about 23 it went away. It’s just coming to terms with accepting a certain part of your life is over and something new has to happen. Things were great until recently. I find myself wishing I was a kid again. There’s big life decisions you’ll have to make when you’re older. Far bigger than what you’re currently facing I promise you. But don’t be scared, you just have to push through. I’m learning now that becoming a man is making the decision you feel is best and accepting whatever consequences come forth as a result. Life isn’t out to get you, it will feel like that though sometimes. Don’t quit on yourself. And please remember, no matter how complex your situation may seem, you’re not alone.

I think it also depends on who you surround yourself with and what you experience. I turned 21 and that's the year I drank for the first time and lost my virginity.

"Me and my ex recently broke up, we had gone through an abortion a year or so into the relationship and it made a huge impact on our sex life and her interest in intimacy. She started having panic attacks during sex and would shove me off her and crawl up in a ball away from me crying. Over time it got worse, we eventually didn’t even have a sex life because she completely avoided it and wouldn’t get any help. 

At the end of last year, she suddenly couldn’t be close to me at all, she couldn’t hug me or want to be hugged, she couldn’t have or give any affection at all, she said she didn’t know if she could be with me anymore. I spent 3 or 4 weeks giving her space and time, but also asking questions as to why and saying she should get some help. She said it’s too hard a topic to talk about so doesn’t want to, I reached my breaking point. She was refusing help to save our relationship and help with these trauma related issues, she didn’t want to be close to me but didn’t want it to end apparently, I had to end the relationship sadly. 

Anyone that’s been through abortion and gained some trauma from it, have you experienced what she’s going through to the same extreme, where even a hug from your partner is too much?"	Excellent-Hotel-2681	post	16.85585676113804	male	White	0.9984080195426941	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
"I'd say we're missing some elements to judge this situation fairly.

Did you support her through her trauma other than by giving her space and time?

Did she fully agree with the idea of getting an abortion back then?

Does she come from a cultural background that heavily frowns upon abortion?"	Excellent-Hotel-2681	reply	na	na	na	0.9984080195426941	no	no	strong	na	MentalHealth

"We’ve been talking for a while but I don’t feel good from the conversation, albeit he was nice to me many times and I’d feel rude if I just cut contact and maybe it’s in my head.

I feel like I can’t be myself, I’m cringe, I should be ashamed of myself whenever he replies to me. Like nothing I share, say is good. 

A few examples ( but basically it happens with everything I say, I write a lot and he barely replies):

- I send cat videos to all of my friends who love cats and he was like: stop it and I just felt bad

- He asked how is it going and I told him I’m really worried about my brother because he was suicidal and got into psych ward and his response: sorry, I don’t want to hear about your brother

- I was madly stressing about an exam ( I do with every exam, but this was particularly bad) I got a teacher who often humiliates students, degrading them and he was like: sorry I can’t deal with your problems right now, I have my own ( I just expected something to calm me or some friendly words I didn’t expect him to be so involved)

- The submersible case at the Titanic, I asked if he heard about it and shared my opinion how horrible it is if they’re still under the ocean alive and how the company didn’t care about safety and his response: How he’s sick of hearing about this and he doesn’t understand why people care about this at all, then 2 days later he told me how he read about the submersible and how unsafe it was

- I’m always worried of failing an exam and he told me how tiring and boring this is for him and I always pass them, but dude I have anxiety and zero confidence and it takes a toll on me physically and mentally.

- I sent him a tiktok video about people who hate cats are red flags because I talked about this with friends how it’s okay to not to like an animal for this and that but to hate it for having their own instincts and behaviour, like hate has to be something personal, not to like e.g. cats is different. And he took it kinda personal how his friends who don’t like cats are just afraid of cats or allergic to them and they’re not red flags. But I told him that’s my point they don’t hate them but don’t like/prefer them for certain reasons and he didn’t even reply to that.

I’m who I’m, not perfect, but I feel so humiliated 90% of the time we talk. He also had good intentions or good advice but mostly this is how our relationship is. I onced stopped talking to him for a while because I got upset, then I told him how it bothered me that when I was totally down because of my brother, he was totally rude ( I didn’t plan to share more details with him about my brother just the fact and how it sucked at the time) and he was like: I was trying to protect myself.

And yeah I have bad depression and anxiety and I tend to see the worst outcomes in my life but I don’t do it intentionally.

I just feel like this relationship just ruins my mental health more, I often felt disgusted at myself when he made comments like this, cringed at myself, and at this point afraid of being myself because I probably suck or I’m annoying. In my opinion he just talks to me because he feels obliged to, because he feels sorry for me ( for mental health problems) but kinda hates me and my personality."	anniehall330	post	27.432574881706646	female	White	0.9994990825653076	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth

"My childhood was pretty bland. I longed for my father’s attention throughout. I got slapped by my father twice over petty issues. I was shouted at/insulted many times by him. I was beaten up by my mother, aunt, and grandfather too. I grew up in a fearful environment. Beating children was a routine. My father didn’t interact with me other than asking me about my grades. I was good in my studies so my father expected outstanding results in high school.

After I got back home after finishing my first exam, I went manic, got hallucinations, and started doing abnormal things. My family sought medical professional help and gave me a tranquilizer and put me to sleep. The next day, they got me checked by a psychiatrist and then I was kept put on tranquilizer injections and antipsychotic drugs.

In between, when I was functioning a bit normally, the psychiatrist kept questioning me about my condition. My first response was that my father doesn’t love me and started crying. Abnormal episodes and hallucinations were not stopping therefore my parents changed my psychiatrist. I was suicidal at that point and took a large quantity of pills, so I got admitted to a mental health facility. The new medication had considerable side effects on me but eventually, I got used to it. There was a considerable drop in my maniac episodes and hallucinations. Doctors diagnosed after hours of therapy that I am suffering from dissociation due to troubled childhood, and advised my parents especially my father to change himself for the sake of his children. He tried to get attached to me and engage in conversations but it wasn’t his nature so he kept dissociating from time to time.

We had a dysfunctional family, my mother tolerated my father all his life and was numb to his aggression. My mental illness couldn’t get cured due to a toxic family environment. I left my studies and rejoined after a year. I had tons of follow-up sessions with my psychiatrist. My health got better in between but not completely healed. I completed my degree and my psychiatrist was all praise for my achievement. I was still on medication though.

He wanted me to get a job so after trying for months I got one. He was of the view that I need exposure which would be beneficial for my mental health and he got somehow a positive result. Though I wasn’t happy with my designation, I found an activity to be busy and that helped me mentally. But I was far from being emotionally stable. My psychiatrist now wants me to get married since he thinks I am stable enough to start a family.

My dating/relationship history was not existent till 30 because I was expected to be chaste until marriage. But I was bored by staying single hence got into a relationship that was toxic, left, and got myself into another unhealthy relationship. My mental health deteriorated due to these relationships. But I can’t tell anybody. It’s eating me up from inside.

I need to talk to somebody but I have no one in real life. So I expect some help and support from you all."	Afraid-Cockroach-889	post	23.01985431620121	male	White	0.013454427011311054	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
"Hey,  


I too grew up with a dysfunctional family. I have struggled so so much in life with making  friends, trusting people and with love and intimacy because the basic emotional needs and feelings of safety and care wasn't met as a child. My father was (still is) a drug addict and just disappeared from my life when i was a young child. My mother was deeply depressed and unhappy and took it out on us (me and my older sister). And my sister bullied me and took out her anger and frustrations on me. To make a long story short - family issues made me a very unhappy and lonely person for most of my life.  I had zero friends in my teens, from 15 til 21 i was isolated and just sat inside my room living in front of my computer.  
I still struggle (i'm 36 now) with trusting people and making friends, and feeling love and having safe and secure attachment to others.  
In short - i know how damaging it can be to a persons emotional and personal development to grow up in a dysfunctional family.  


What kind of help you are getting now? Do you feel your sessions with your psychiatrist are helping you? What's your relationship to your family now?

"My ex and I broke up about two months ago and before that I would have trusted him with my life. There was a lot of things he “couldn’t tell me” about why we broke up and apparently he couldn’t tell me why. He kept telling me not to tell my family when we had a small amount of contact but again couldn’t tell me why. I started to feel like I couldn’t trust any of my family but I had to keep trying to push the doubt away because I had no real reason not to trust them. 

Yesterday my sil and I went to a psychic where I found out a lot about myself and some about her. Everything the psychic told me was extremely accurate and not just in a generic way it was a very in depth and very accurate description which is why when she told my sil she needs to tell me something important and that she’s put it off for too long I get worried. I wasn’t there when it was said, but apparently she was also told to protect me from a specific thing which she also won’t tell me. She was the only one I thought I could trust after my ex left but with all my feelings and what the psychic said I don’t feel like I have anyone to talk to anymore."	ightimmaheadout37	post	20.81807573647918	male	White	0.004837559536099434	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth

"I (f17) have never had an interest in people and making friends. It was so bad that in 2020, I dropped the three friends I had, as it felt too overwhelming. I finally made a friend again in 2021, and we still talk. My issue is, I haven’t messaged her in 2 weeks, just because I don’t seem to have the energy nor do I think it’s important. I can’t make friends irl (I never leave the house), so I resort to everything online. 

Whenever people message me and seem interested in becoming my friend, I might message them for a few days before just giving up. I don’t have an interest in making friends, or talking to people in general. 

Some of my family seems to act the same way. My mom has no friends, nor does she talk about wanting friends, as well as my grandparents and sibling. Is this a sign of some mental issue? My family does have a history of anxiety and depression, but I’m wondering if there’s not something else going on as well.

"We can't diagnose, but I want to make this point. The ability to get along with people will be *more important in your career than your academic achievements*. That is what people who have carefully studied successful people, Emma Seppala of the Yale School of Management and the famous self-help wizard Dale Carnegie, have said.  
  
Carnegie's daughter Donna Carnegie wrote a version of her father's classic ""For Teen Girls.""  
  
Again, this is not a diagnosis but I'll offer this social anxiety advice, which includes advice for social skills.  
  
A great thing about Dr. Seppala's book, The Happiness Track, is that it tells you how to be successul with low stress.  
  
A quote from a book that has been a best-seller for generations --  
  
  
""It's much easier to make friends by becoming interested in other people than by trying to get other people interested in you."" \~ Dale Carnegie in How to Win Friends and Influence People  
  
  
Flattery will get you nowhere but a sincere compliment now and then can work wonders, especially when somebody is feeling down. It's all about sincerity. Be seriously interested in what the other guy says.  
  
This might be a problem that will take some time to work out with a professional. I'll mention two books that can help. Handbook of Self-Help Therapies, which reviews studies of books and programs, says that the writings of Barbara Markway help people with moderate social anxiety. Her most recent book is Painfully Shy. How to Win Friends and Influence People has been a best seller for generations.  
  
  
Someone here has said that two things were very helpful for her social anxiety - a sport, playing on a high school team, and working at a place that gave her detailed instructions for dealing with customers. The second thing reminds me of a resource businesses often recommend for their sales people - How to Win Friends and Influence People  
  
  
Slow breathing can help with awkward social situations and phobias. You can get good and relaxed, then imagine yourself in a situation that makes you nervous.  Doctors recommend a simple exercise - breathe gently through the nose, 6 sec inhale and 6 sec exhale.  
You can also slow your breathing just before and during a conversation.  
  
  
There is some evidence that mindfulness helps. Apps like Headspace are very popular. Mindful Life Project is easy to use and free.

Just as title says when I was like 9 years old I found that resting my neck onto closed fists would make me feel good for a minute, even then I knew there’s no way this is not bad for you cause I would do it and would go into this weird conscious unconscious state where I’m still conscious but I’m not in control of anything I’m just watching my body move around frantically trying to grab on to things to keep me from falling over in the chair I was in (doing it while standing would cause discomfort/disorientation, even though I still do that occasionally) but it’s scared me so much thinking about how I’m literally choking myself for a few seconds like hundreds of times a day, I’ve started to rely on it so much as a coping skill I wanted to shed light on it as I couldn’t find anywhere of people doing this same thing only of people being addicted to asphyxiation in general but this was so much worse being a kid It didn’t look like I was choking myself I was just resting my head reallly weird, I’d do it in school I’d do it at home i basically did it any place I could other than like at restaurants or anything in cars and I wanted help on how to stop it as no matter what I fo I literally mad myself have a panic attack about this just to try to scare myself away from it yet I still do it because I can literally do the whole process of it start to finish in 10 seconds without even noticing I did it. I tried wearing a ring for a while to make it hurt when I did it, but within a couple days I was habitually taking the ring off, doing it then putting the ring back on.

"Hi everyone. I would like to share what I have been going through for the past year with my relationship and ROCD. It might be a bit too long, this post will be a kind of a vent and a help call I guess.

So, I met my (21M) girlfriend (20F) a year ago during the summer. We were in the same friend circle and over a time course of a couple weeks, we began dating. I’m saying dating but it was kind of a weird phase. I never had any relation or intimacy of any kind with anyone before her. We were chilling in my flat and watching a film when we started to kiss and had intercourse. After that we started to become lovers and everything was going nicely, I was the happiest person for a while. Then after some time I heard from people about her ex(whom she had broke up a month before) and how he had a bigger d and politically powerful and successfull in many areas he is (his father is apperantly a very popular politician) etc.

This is where everthing started to go downhill. I never really focused nor cared much about her past, not being her first and all that. But I started to have thoughts arising all the time. For example, why did my friends know these details if she had not told them? What if she is playing it safe by being with me? You know the list goes on and on. These thoughts started to put the pressure on me really and about a couple of weeks into our relationship I developed psychological ED for some time due to the clouded thoughts. This pushed me to “fix myself”, I searched for cures for my condition, started to change my diet, started taking a shit ton of pills and supplements, I even bought viagra once (I did not told her these, and my ED eventually subsided)

Then we had a talk about her past, where I learned some stuff that I probanly should never have. She told me that he was treating her extremely judgeful because of her past and she told me how she didn’t want to go through it again, so I did not push/want her to tell me about it. Although this would prove to be not effective because I started to get extremely anxious and depressed. I started to eat less and lose weight rapidly (Im down from 82 kilos muscular to 68 kilos skinny now) and started to smoke weed and antidepressants almost every day to ease my anxiety. Eventually we had “the talk”, where we talked about our past experiences. I wont go into too much detail of our talk but she told me that she had slept with 8 guys before me and 6 of them were one night stands, that her first was during highschool. Momenteraly, I felt like an empty vessel and I didnt know how to respond because I did not expect what she have told me at all. So we had a “breakup” which lasted only for an hour which ended by she coming back to my house and we somehow closed the talk and moved on. Then she started to live with me and it was a bit easier during the next couple of months. However I was struggling with ROCD harshly ever since and I do not want to put her in a position where she would feel bad about her past, especially since I know that her ex was treating her badly because of it. We had a couple more talks about me and her revolving around ROCD and her past etc. 

Now, I do not know what to do. Everything seems to trigger my rocd. I have tried meditation, boooks, guides essentially everthing except prescribed medications. I love her but I cant find joy in anything in my life anymore. I burst into tears randomly and feeling suicidal frequently. There are a ton of stuff that I would like to add but honeslty I think my point has been across. Please, please, help me. I cant do this anymore."	happy-monke	post	21.88155175318613	male	White	0.988105297088623	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth

I never expected to live this long. Since I was 14/15 I never imagined myself to live to 19 so I never envisioned a future for myself e.g a career, family or anything really. I have no aspirations and the limited amount of hobbies I do have I’m not good at enough and I feel like I am actually wasting away doing nothing. I studied hard in school and have good grades but I decided not to go to uni. I had a retail job for a while but my contract expired and I can’t find anything for work now. I thought I would have figured things out by now. What career I wanted my hopes for the future but there is none. I know all my life will be working miserably earning barely money, complaining about prices of things and the state of everything in the world right now. My physical health is worsening and i wake up with chronic jaw ache everyday. Im not even 20 yet and i cant endure anymore. I don’t know who i am anymore. I remember being 10 and dreaming of being an adult but its actual hell. Im scared for everything and i feel like i need to hurry up and figure things out. My parents think im lazy and i know i am too. Idk what to do i feel like the world is just passing me by.

I am not productive at all and it annoys me because i want to be doing something else with my time other than wasting so much time. So, my question is what would you suggest me to do ? What other aspects of my life I should be changing do that i wont sleep all day long ? I talked to my psychiatrist about this and she told me that in my current state she can't modify my treatment.

"I was talking to my stepmother last night and, mind you, we have an ok relationship. Even so, the conversation ended pretty badly.

I was sharing some personal information about my past with my mom, about how I realized in recent years, that I never had a proper birthday, despite being taught the importance of birthdays, and how she was the biggest reason for that to happen.
On the other side, my last birthday was about a month ago, and it got ruined because my father demanded I was in the way of his work for not reminding him to buy ingredients for my cake soon enough.
For some more context, I've been struggling with severe depression and anxiety for the past 5 years (I'm now 23) and this affected me a lot because I really wanted to spend a good birthday for once, also considering it was my first birthday together with him (he did not raise me).

Back to the main subject, I guess my stepmother remembered the situation and told me that I chose to be hurt, I'm letting myself suffer and that may continue my ""bad birthday streak"".

To be honest, I think this is absolute bullsh*t. I think I have the right to feel hurt and disappointed as a daughter, and I feel like I'm receiving gaslighting from both of them.
I didn't choose to ruin my day. He did let me know how much I was on the way of his work, and I canceled my birthday because I felt like a burden.

I don't want to receive anything from anybody if they let me know they're either uncomfortable or having a hard time because of that something I'm getting from them. It doesn't feel like a gift anymore.

To summarize the rest of the situation, I told my stepmother I regret sharing these kind of things with her since she will always go back to defend her husband and I made myself clear by repeating I didn't choose to get hurt by the situation.

So, am I correct, or do I lack self-awareness?"	shuzukeeh	post	30.567187199574345	female	White	0.9995015859603882	na	na	na	2	MentalHealth

"You are responsible for your feelings, you aren't responsible for the pain it causes you. However even if you aren't the one who caused it you to still feel and you have to find a healthy way of processing the pain. Every human feels. It's how we know we are hurt. I know it sounds unfair and saying life is unfair is cliche.

You are stuck with them regardless of if the person who  makes you feel them gets punished to neglects to reconcile. You have to decide the best way of processing them and how to heal from your pain.

It's like if someone stabs you. Yes they are a bad person and they stabbed you - however at the end of the day they have free autonomy on whether they feel like calling the ambulance or not. 

However you still bleed out unless YOU take initiative to deal with it. It sucks and you aren't the one who caused the mess but you have to clean it up. It's sucks I know but that's why I quoted the cliche. :/

"
I’ve been meditating, journaling and exercising for months and I don’t see any results. Despite my gratitude journaling I still feel miserable at times and I find myself thinking I hate my life and existence. 

I still overthink and maladaptive daydream. I’ve gotten stronger while working out at the gym but I still get intimated by others and also anxious when I get thoughts having to confront others. I’m not growing as a person I feel stagnant.


I feel like it’s so easy to be happy and go lucky when everything is going your way. The life I live isn’t like that at all. From the month of May all the way till recently I’ve been doing job interview after interview and getting rejected nonstop. 

Dress well, solid resume, show up on time and interview well but I still got rejected. I had a goal to get a car by the end of the summer before school starts by the goal is nowhere near in sight. 

From January to May I’ve been applying for internships but I don’t have a single one that accepted me. 

But that’s not the first time I set a goal and failed. It’s been like this my whole life all 21 years on this earth. I’m a lost cause born to suffer. 

I don’t want to hear the “You’re only 20”. Experiences, failures, win and losses all shape a man. No one who’s failed and lost their entire life is happy. They are all sad and disappointed by life."	Many_Line9136	post	23.10344347026315	male	White	0.9988765120506287	na	na	na	5	MentalHealth

"I'm sorry to say this to you, but you seem to be the problem. Your thinking that is. And I'm also sorry to tell you, but....you're only 21 years old! 

So, you set some goals, that from what I can see, all focused on one thing, getting a job/internship, which would allow you to buy a car before the end of summer and school starts. The one failure caused the other failure. I hope you see that. That you essentially put all your eggs in the one basket. These aren't failures. These are disappointments. You're acting like these things were in your control and you messed up instead of identifying the fact that you tried and didn't get what you wanted from someone else, who made a choice that didn't favour you. There's a massive difference. Your choice of words clearly indicates where you are and how you're thinking, and I get it. 

To set a goal and want to achieve it is always something positive. Kudos to you. So, you didn't get it, so what?! It sucks for sure, but now you gotta focus on what next. It's not the end of the world, my friend. That's life in a nutshell. If you stop trying after a few months because you didn't get what you want in life, you're gonna have a long (or short) and painfully disappointing life. Wait till you hit adulthood with a career and bills to pay, but hate your job and your employer, barely make enough to pay said bills, are living paycheque to paycheque not living the life you want, not able to provide for your children, relationship sucks (if you even have one) and in your thirties, forties, fifties, etc. How does that hit you? Doesn't sound too pleasant, now does it? 

Your plans hit a speedbump. That's it. That's all. Try and enjoy the rest of your summer. You don't have a new car, but clearly, you were surviving without it before. You're still in school, I can see, so clearly you're succeeding there (regardless of the caliber of your grades), you're still in there working away enough to be considering an internship. How are you a failure? Still not seeing it, bro! You're going to the gym and getting stronger. Still not seeing the failure, bro! 

You get intimidated at the gym and have ""thoughts"" about confrontation?! Have you had one - a confrontation? You sound like you're focused on your perceived shortcomings and think everyone can see them. Not too people care about you because they're focused on themselves. And if they are focused on you, change your workout times and go when it's less busy or avoid the negative peeps. Listen to your tunes and focus on YOUR workout. You're there to workout and for yourself, not for others. You're getting stronger and healthier for you. They just don't matter, but you're making them matter. Live for yourself and not for others. You're getting distracted from the mission: you and your life.

I spent two years slowly going insane at my job and was  close to leaving, but suddenly, an opportunity came around. I spent three years getting over a breakup and not having any control and time with my only child at the time. It worked out over time. It's wasn't perfect, but it got better. It stiĺl upsets me, but im focused on the positive of having a great relationship with my son in the here and now. You want things now and I'm here to tell you that's not how life always works. For some, maybe, but not for me and you. What matters is that you don't quit the moment you get disappointed. You sound better than that. Take a step back and breathe for a moment. 

Besides school and getting stronger, I don't hear anything negative about your health. So, that's another win in your column. You twentysomethings don't understand how grateful you should be just for that alone. You think you got problems now, throw in sickness, injury, or bad health and now you got something to legit complain about. Trust me when I say it can always be worse. I've lost multiple relatives in the last two years, you and I still are here able to live another day and achieve our goals. Some people never get the chance. Be grateful for that chance.

If you can, reach out to the employers and ask for feedback, if possible. See where you might have gone wrong and where you could improve. Talk to a guidance counselors or someone in the field for their guidance and feedback on your  resume and what you're bringing to the table. Is there something that you might be missing or overlooking? Another pair of eyes and perspective is massively beneficial. Most of all, you're not a failure until you quit. You haven't yet. Don't. 

Finally, you need to take a break and surround yourself with people and things that will take your mind off things. It's the summer and you need to enjoy it because it only lasts so long before it's gone. Then you'll be complaining about having wasted that too. Don't be that guy. 

You still might not get what you want in life and especially in the time you've given yourself. However, things in my experience have a way of working themselves out. It just takes time sometimes. Don't be discouraged. You honestly have time to F up, make mistakes, take alternative routes and still potentially figure it all out in the end. 

Life can suck, but your mindset and how you handle those so-called setbacks truly matters. Sometimes you need to get creative and/or change your speed and even your destination. You're far from done here. You still got this man.

So, this is about medication, right?  
  
Maybe the answer is seeing another doctor. I can give you some info about non-drug things that can help with anxiety and ADHD.  
  
Relaxation with the traditional Asian methods can help with ADHD. Psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg, who have published 6 papers on breathing and mental health, recommend a 3-part program of mind-body methods - breathing, meditation, and slow body movement. Incorporate these into your daily life. Be aware of changes in mood and respond mindfully, aware of your breathing. Details here -

"Hey everyone. The past couple of weeks I (f23) have experienced intense anxiety and some panic attacks here and there. It's made me not wanna leave my house, out of fear it's gonna happen in public again, and my motivation to do the easiest of tasks has gone out the window. I can barely take a shower or go to the toilet, and eating is hard too considering one of my main physical symptom I get when I don't feel great mentally, is nausea. 
I feel lonely because I'm by myself most of the day and even when my parents come home (yeah, I still live with them) I start to feel guilty for not feeling great and not having the strength to put a mask on, because I don't want them to worry about me or feel like it's their fault. I know it would probably be good to go out more, find a hobby or just do something with friends, but I can't even bring myself to do that. 
I also have no goals and hopes for my life anymore and I feel like I'll never be able to be in a relationship because I'm constantly in my head and too focused on whatever's going on in there.
My chest feels heavy all the time, I can't really cry and I feel nauseous. I'm not su*cidal, but I'm scared that if my life continues like this I will get to that point. And it feels like I'm gonna feel like this forever.

I have an appointment with a psychiatrist next week but that's still 10 days away and it's only the assessment thing, even if they diagnose me with something, I'll probably be put on a waiting list that's at least 5 months.

"The beauty of self-help is that you have a variety of low cost, low risk things that can be combined with each other, and with standard treatments with office visits. While it's not clear at this time that any one of these things is as effective as an antidepressant, it's common sense that if a variety of reasonably good things are combined with each other, they will have considerable effect.  
I can't tell you exactly what you need. There's no one size fits all solution. I can tell you though that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits.

This has never happened to me before but today I had a really good day with my family, which is really rare. By family I mean my dad, younger sister and younger brother. Anyways afterwards on my drive home I started crying hysterically so bad that I needed to pull over cause I could no longer see the road. I don't cry much anymore so when I do I try to analyze what I'm feeling and why and I couldn't come up with a definitive answer. My thoughts were of how I felt as a teenager and just everything I felt back then when I was extremely depressed almost as if my brain was telling me I was too happy and needed to dial it back. Now that I've calmed down I'm just confused why the fuck that happened and I'm a little angry that I couldn't just enjoy the day and end the day on a good note. Has anybody ever done/felt this?

"Absolutely, this is a completely normal thing to do, I’ve done this plenty of times, I’m so happy that you had a good day with your family that is amazing, those thoughts you had that pull you back to when you were a teenager are normal, it is the trauma in your brain telling you “remember what you felt when you were younger, I’m just here to remind you” and that voice that little person will be there for a while, it is part of the healing process, you will learn to shut that voice out and eventually ignore it completely till it isn’t there anymore, focus on all of what’s going on, the good and the bad, in the moment, whatever may be happening that day, think of the good and the bad, and place them on an imaginary scale, for example, you had a good day with your family, whatever you might’ve done with your family today think about that and the good times you had with all of them, then think about the bad times when you were a teenager, think about what you went through, what you dealt with, how hard it was, now think about both of them and do a sort of pros and cons thought pattern about them, you had a good day, that’s amazing, absolutely fantastic, that made you happy, focus on that happiness and hold onto it no matter how hard it is or how loud that voice gets, you are doing incredible things in your life and you should be proud of yourself, I am mate, and I don’t even know you, you speaking out about this issue is incredible and I’m proud of you my friend, if you ever do need a chat mate, I am always available, I will do what I have been doing on a few posts I’ve seen and placing a discord link to The Safe Place, which is a server I run for people to come and talk and open up about their mental health and receive direct advice and help from people, even if it’s just sitting and having a friendly chat, talking about what might be going good for you, it’s up to you whether you join or not mate, but it is there if you need it mate, you are doing incredible and I am very happy for you mate, the day you had today was a good day, remember that my friend, stay strong mate!

"I suffer from GAD and OCD and have tried a wide variety of medications over the years. I'm currently taking vortioxetine (I've titrated up to 20mg, which I've been on for a few weeks) which seems to be helping with depression but not so much with anxiety - both the physical symptoms and the rumination, DP/DR, agoraphobia that comes with it.  
I've had significant stretches in my life when anxiety hasn't been a problem but it's very severe at the moment. Do you think that the key to overcoming anxiety is primarily psychological through exposures and tolerating the symptoms or is there a chemical fix to this condition (other than benzos, which I use but am trying to avoid as much as possible)? When my anxiety is high I become obsessed that I'm on the ""wrong meds"" and convince myself I need to try a different medication but I've tried pretty much every drug out there and none of them seem to have cracked the condition.  
My anxiety seems to ease from time to time, particularly in the evening, and what that happens I'm more able to reason with the illness but it always comes back."	No_Incident7570	post	40.66593154367367	male	White	0.995978832244873	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
"Meds are not always helpful. A good thing about therapy is that the skills you learn in therapy get better the more you practice them.  
  
Statistics tell us what's best for people in general, not you as an individual.  
  
This article from the American Psychological Association says that most people with anxiety disorders do better with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) than with medicine.  
  
https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/medication-or-therapy#:\~:text=For%20anxiety%20disorders%2C%20cognitive%2Dbehavioral,improve%20outcomes%20from%20psychotherapy%20alone.  
  
Although self-help based on CBT has not been shown to be as effective as the standard treatments for anxiety with office visits, some people benefit from it. Authoritative Guide to Self-Help Resources in Mental Health, a book based on polls of more than 3,000 professionals, says that The Feeling Good Handbook by Dr. David Burns, a psychiatrist and cognitive therapy expert, is the one recommended most often by professionals.   
  
In recent years, there has been very encouraging evidence for therapeutic breathing, which can be combined with cognitive therapy methods for dealing with worrisome thoughts.  
  
When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.  
  
One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.  
  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.  
  
Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
Also, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.  
  
The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication.  
  
Don't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety.  
  
Video - a lot of helpful information, including the 3-part program of Brown and Gerbarg -  
  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEM\_jlDRZI  
  
I'll mention a book that you can talk about with your therapist.  
  
If you go to the Amazon ad for You Are Not Your Brain by psychiatrist Jeffrey Schwartz, you'll see that people with OCD think very highly of this book. You can also hear the testimonials of readers on YouTube.  
  
As this article shows, Dr Schwartz developed a therapy for OCD that has been validated with brain scan studies.

"Can somebody working for a Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team have a relationship with a former patient once discharged?

I'm deeply attracted to one of the nurses who is part of the crhtt. I may have said something which possibly made her aware of this, and since then In our appointments I have felt/seen strong intense eye contact between us, a lot of smiling, chemistry and mutual attraction between us. I actually can't stop thinking about her tbh.. I have looked up the Code of Conduct/Practice for this specific organization in my area, and all it details is that ""should a relationship exist, employees must notify their line manager who will decide if this gives rise to a conflict of interest, or could be construed to give rise to a conflict"". This translates to me that it is up to the line managers discretion (who might've been the other member of staff with her at the last visit). Whereas in my Google searches the results where that usually nurse and former patient relationships will 'often' not be acceptable. Also read that it depends on the time frame and how much time/communication was spent together between the two parties - the justification was that if communication or time spent together was short lived/brief (like with this type of service) rather than occurring over months or years it is more likely to be acceptable.

The service is a short term one, i've had maybe 5 or 6 home visits from them with her being present only 3 times or so.. After that the plan is for me to be discharged and referred over to the Neigbourhood mental health team for further support.

As you can probably tell from my writing I really like this person lol.. Its also the feeling/intuition that these feelings could be mutual or reciprocated from my interactions with her and her body language, that's making it hard not to think about her and difficult to resist the urge to be upfront with her upon being discharged on Saturday..

Are there any mental health professionals here who could clear this up for me?

"No, it is not ethical to have any sort of relationship beyond a professional one with your patient. 

My professional order states there must be at least a few years between being patient and having a relationship for it to be considered ethical. And even then, the length of time in therapy etc are considered. 

Short term sessions and being discharged soon are good. 

Another thing to consider is whether the professional feels the same way or if you are experiencing transference."	Uhh_zain	reply	na	na	na	0.002129791770130396	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth
"I’m not asking for someone to diagnose me, I’d just like to know if anyone else has experienced this or even heard of this. I’ve been unable to find any info on my own. The doctors aren’t figuring it out either. Aside from them saying it’s likely trauma based. I apologize the explanations might be a bit confusing or vague. Unfortunately I don’t fully remember these very well and I can only describe from what little I can remember and what others have told me. This is gonna be long so I apologize but any help is greatly appreciated. I’m 25 AFAB, though I identify they/he. 

Originally I was referring to these as dizzy spells. In 2020, my doctor began calling them seizures, which is what we’ve been calling them since. However I recently went to the hospital during one and the doctor there said they aren’t seizures after I had to wait 5 hours and they sent me home without offering any guidance. 

Going more into detail. These started back in late 2018 from what I can remember. Sometimes I would get this weird Deja vu feeling and get dizzy and spaced out for a few seconds. It was a feeling of I’ve lived this before, I’ve seen this before. This exact moment. But it’s not me. It’s my life. But it’s not me. Somethings… off? However within minutes I’d be back to normal. When I mentioned it to my family doctor he had me wear a heart monitor for two weeks. This showed no abnormalities.

By April 2021, something changed. These “dizzy spells” became more intense. I noticed a trend that they most commonly happened in the shower. Though they can happen other places too. The feeling grew into something of yes, this is so familiar, but it was like watching a grainy rerun of a tv show. It wasn’t clear. I couldn’t place it but it was like it was just out of reach. It’s real but fake. It’s like drifting between what’s happening and something that isn’t but not being able to tell which one is which. I can hear someone or something. But it’s not clear. I feel a presence but no one is there. I start to get nauseous, I overheat, I can’t focus at all, I get dizzy, I can’t tell what’s real. Static in my head and skin. An unpleasant prickly sensation. I just start to panic. 

I began passing out sometimes during these episodes in 2021. The very first experience of this was while showering. I felt the usual warning signs of it starting and suddenly a static like feeling in my head and skin. Everything was then gone. I woke up later in my bed. I was playing music. When I woke up the music was paused. The shower had been turned off. I had dried myself off and dressed myself properly. I apologize if this is tmi, but I was somehow able to put on a bra during this as well. I was home by myself. I can only remember the feeling starting, I started panicking, and then I was waking up in my bed. It seemed I had taken a fall during this as I had bruises on my body and a black eye.

We believe I’ve had minor concussions from these at least 4 times as I’ve experienced awful dizziness, nausea and headaches after some and bruising on my head. I regret to say I never once went to the doctor to confirm this and instead tried to ignore the discomfort that could last up to almost two weeks. I know it was dumb of me but I have a hard time with doctors and hospitals and I didn’t want to put anymore stress on myself. Of course, after these possible concussions, I have become light and sound sensitive in the last two years. I had to start wearing tinted glasses when I went to work because the lighting caused discomfort. Also as of February this year, anytime I have one where I lose consciousness I wake up with a headache that pain killers won’t fix. But there’s no bruising or anything so I don’t think I’ve been falling. Especially since they are happening mostly when I’m sitting or laying down now. 

There seems to be 3 types of these “seizures”. The minor ones that only last 5-15 minutes. This is only the Deja vu, dizziness, overheating and slight nausea. The middle ones are where I also feel I’m drifting between what’s real and some kind of other place. I’m conscious, but I space out and struggle to speak or do things. Then the bad ones are where I feel the static, I lose consciousness and wake up with an awful headache, nausea, I can’t focus for hours sometimes and I am exhausted. 

To give some info based on witnesses

-In March I had one and my mom was with me thankfully. She sat with me and tried to get me to respond but she described it as I was basically staring through her. Showing no signs of hearing or seeing her at all. She called an ambulance and during the wait, I apparently got up and tried walking around the house. Mom brought me back to bed so I was safe. When the ambulance arrived, I was still not responsive. It took hours for me to fully be able to communicate normally. 

-A few months before this I was living with roommates. I had one of these happen and one of them came home during it. I had walked out of my room to her, she described it as me almost trying to ask for help but no words came out. I brought her to my room and there I had spilled a drink. She put me back in bed and cleaned up the mess. I woke up later and she told me what happened. 

-another moment with my previous roommates, I had called out to them one day from my room. There, I was on the floor. They described it as it looking like I was choking on my own saliva so they turned my head. They said I was also twitching slightly. They got the help of a guest and lifted me from the floor onto my bed. I woke up later with no memory of this.

-again, with my roommate, one day while she was at work I was trying to text her for help. I have slight memories of this experience. What I was seeing in my messages was words (which they weren’t. They were just gibberish). But I could not understand hers at all. She ended up calling me and I wasn’t able to talk. Instead just making sounds at first. This is the first experience in which someone had technically been present for one of these “seizures”. 

-it’s also been told to me by the roommates that during less intense episodes I repeat words or sounds and motions like moving my hands. 

The thing is, it’s been 5 years and nothing has been accomplished. I’m frustrated. I’m scared and I feel so hopeless. I’m unable to work anymore. I’m scared to leave the house. I just want some kind of idea. I already struggle with depressive episodes, bad anxiety, paranoia and hallucinations. I have no diagnosis for anything I’m going through. The doctors have been almost useless and it’s only getting worse. Two brain scans showed no abnormalities. I’ve had 4 of these “seizures” in the last 72 hours. I had one earlier today and haven’t been able to do anything since. Only one of these caused me to lose consciousness, the rest were minor and I was fine after 15 minutes. My head aches, pain killers are useless. I’m exhausted, barely able to focus and it’s hard to push myself on when this is stopping me from doing anything with myself. 

Please, if anyone has any ideas or suggestions let me know. I can’t keep existing like this."	ghoulijah	post	19.476675782674	male	White	0.02267453819513321	na	na	na	2	MentalHealth
"This is 100% a form of epilepsy.  Speaking from personal experience.  The deja vu you described, together with the 'absences' is spot on for my experiences also.

You need to keep at your doctors.  Which country are you in?  They need to do an EEG - an Electro Encephalogram - if they haven't before.

The good news is epilepsy is largely treatable with medicine.

"This sounds much more like epileptic seizures than any mental issue. I've had short absence seizures before and I've definitely moved during these while unconscious. 

From my own experience with doctors when it comes to epilepsy, you really got to insist on every test. Try to get an EEG and even if it turns out normal don't give up. You could even try to ask your mother or roommate to film you when you are having a seizure, that's usually helpful for doctors as well."	ghoulijah	reply	na	na	na	0.02267453819513321	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealth
"My whole childhood was spent on video games. My parents said that as soon as they gave me my GameCube, I was hooked on it. That was before I even started school. I continued to play games all the way out of high school, and it was basically my only hobby. I moved around a lot too so the friends on there stayed with me.

Now I’m 23, I have a decent job and an amazing girlfriend. But when I’m not working and my girlfriend isn’t with me, which is a good chunk of time, I no longer know what to do with myself. Games don’t feel the same anymore. Even so, I’m stuck in this loop where I try to play games, get bored, and then just watch videos of other people playing games. 

Whenever I try a new hobby, it’s hard not to get overwhelmed and get sucked into that loop. I’m not sure why. It’s like I think I’ll have an amazing time if I get on my computer, just to sit down and be bored with no motivation to get back up.

I’m not sure if that sounds pathetic but I’d really love to break the loop, I’m just not sure how. I set all of these plans when I’m at work but I lose the motivation when I’m home. Died anyone have any tips?

"First, I want to say that I'm not against those games. I know that for a lot of people, the games are important socially.   
  
In fact, psychologists are saying that the high incidence of depression with girls stems from the fact that they are on social media while the boys are gaming.  
  
It's just that it's good for people to develop more interests.

"When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.  
  
One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.  
  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.  
  
Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
Also, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes."	strangeperson14	reply	na	na	na	0.9989686012268066	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth

"I don't use reddit but I just made this account to write this.  

I'm 15F and I've been struggling with almost complete isolation since covid started. It's been over 3 years and it seems like everyone else got over the effects of quarantine and isolation but I didn't. When I was 12, I was already depressed and isolated socially. Not super depressed, but I was in my first year of middle school and was very awkward and socially inept, and spoke to no one at all. I got bullied for not having friends and for having panic attacks at school, often in front of others kids. I got a lot more depressed when quarantine started. I was supposed to finish the rest of 6th grade online, but I didn't do it. I went through a major depressive episode instead which lasted until the end of the year. It's gross to say, but I didn't take care of myself during that time at all. I wore the same clothes, the same hoodie for months and only showered about once a month- just once my hair was matted, and I had to wear different clothes because a growth spurt was making them too tight.  

I didn't get out of bed at all, I slept whenever I wanted for however long I wanted. Sometimes I'd sleep up to 30 hours. I didn't leave my room at all unless it was to use the bathroom. Didn't open the window, hardly even sat up or ate. When school started back up again, I was still doing online of course and I tried at first to do it but the assignments were too hard and my sleep schedule was off from the zoom schedule. Staying up for class and passing out in the middle of the meeting wasn't working anymore so I just quit. My mom got mad and took my phone, made me start going outside even for a bit and had me to homework 24/7 with her help. It helped pull me out of it a bit and I got back into contact with old friends, though only over the phone and going out on occasion.   

During the summer after, I talked more to people online since I didn't really see people. But for some reason, when school started back up again (still online) just a couple months before I turned 14, I for some reason deleted all my social media and blocked every person I knew. I guess I just didn't want to talk to people anymore- it was too stressful checking my phone every morning for an angry friend's text message.  

I isolated myself a lot more after this, since I already isolated myself online, I isolated myself in person too. I stopped going to public places and only saw close family. I was doing better in school too. I wasn't doing good, but I wasn't failing. During the end of summer after 8th grade and the beginning of 9th grade, I isolated even more. Leaving the house became much more rare and it became more of a hassle to get me out of the house.  

I refused to celebrate my birthday, and only left twice at the end of the year to celebrate a small and uneventful Thanksgiving and Christmas. After Christmas though, I isolated completely, which was six months ago and I haven't left the house since. That's not an exaggeration either. Maybe I've stepped out the front door to bring in some mail but that's it. My mom gave up on trying to get me to leave the house and stopped bothering to talk to me or check in. I've ignored every call and text from the few family members who still bother to contact me once a month.  

The past few years I've daydreamed a lot to avoid boredom and depression and it's taken over a lot of my life. It's practically swallowed these past 6 months. I daydream constantly. From when I wake up to when I go to sleep at night. I am horrified of stopping because when I stop, I'm bombarded with thoughts about reality that I held, and eventually every one or two months it happens and it's awful. Whenever I have those times I can't daydream anymore, I break down because of how awful my life is, how much time I've wasted- I don't even have a perception of time anymore. February feels as far away as last week. 
  
I get super depressed, and for lack of a better word, suicidal. I don't necessarily think about suicide, more of what would happen after. I don't talk to anyone and the only person who sees me hardly checks in on me so I can't help but wonder how long it would take for anyone to even realize I'm dead. A while, probably. But I don't really want to die. I want to live life, just not this one. There's really nothing and no one out there for me, nothing I'd ever want. I feel like I screwed up the life I got. It's ruined now and I wanna throw it away and start anew, but I can't and I hate that I can't. I want to be somewhere else, somewhere that was made for me, a world I'd be happier in. Maybe it's the daydreaming so I have high expectations, but still. Nothing here feels real, I feel like if I went outside no one would be there. As if I'm dead and just roaming something that no longer exists- like the world left me behind or something.  

I've tried daydreaming about achievable things I can get in this world, and none of it is what I want. Kids, money, ""dream"" career, I have no desire for any of it and I've spent so much time imagining an achievable life, even if it's unrealistic or difficult to get, I can't imagine being happy in any of them. It's like I'm doomed to be miserable no matter what life I lead. I mean it's been years since I've spoken to someone my own age in person. I feel like I'm wasting what are supposed to be the best years of my life (highschool) and I'm not even going or making friends, and I feel like it should be important to me but I don't see the appeal. The thought about this has been getting a lot worst too. I'll cry for hours, when I wake up, during the day and when I should be sleeping. I'll cry until the sun comes up and will still feel depressed. Being depressed while having an existential crisis makes me feel physically ill to the point i'll vomit. I'll go without sleeping for days and will only be able to sleep once I pass out and wake up a few hours later.  

It feels like whatever life I had left has fallen apart, i've tried desperately searching for things to make me happy again- trying to find a new escape i can endulge in since the ones I relied on are only making me sadder. But it all makes me sad and ruins my perspective on it so I'll never be able to like it in the future. I'm way to deep in isolation to be able to force myself out. I don't have anywhere to go anyways, no one to see. I don't have anyone to talk to either, I don't have friends online and I don't talk to family except for my mom on the occasion. Not about how I feel though. Shes struggled with depression and suicide in the past and is struggling with depression more now and I don't want to overshadow her or put her mental health at risk by piling my issues onto her when theres really nothing she can do, since I chose to isolate myself and am choosing not to stop. Part of which is because I'm insecure. I really hate the way I look. I don't think i'm terribly unattractive but I feel like the way I look is shameful and I don't deserve to show myself in public and I don't know how to make that thought go away. I've never been called ugly but i can't remember the last time I was called pretty either.  

I really just hope there's other people out there who have/are going through something similar or can at least understand and give me some advice or insight :(

I was with this girl since 2014, there were ups and downs throughout, but somehow we were still together although it bothered her a lot, we tried communicating things yet it wasnt that great, she wanted to leave and move on but i was hesitant, i was dependent on her so badly for everything but she finally decided to end this, she wanted to have a life without the relationship, i couldn’t stop it, i let her go, it’s been a month i haven’t talked to her and there’s this void. This void which no one can fill , no matter what i do i carry this with me everywhere and i hate it. I should move on but all i think about are the moments we had and i try my best to not think about it, but the thoughts just creeps in. When I’m asleep, these thoughts never leave me and now i can’t have a peaceful sleep any more without feeling anxious. It’s hard to express how broken i feel, feels like I’m out of oxygen,  claustrophobic , i want to stop feeling this way, i want to go about my life, stop all these thoughts of her. Somedays i feel like i have moved on, somedays it feels like there’s no point any more.

"My girlfriend (20) and I (25) have been going out for about a year and a half now. She has had many mental health issues in her past, including multiple trips to the mental hospital. She had issues with self harm and drugs/overdosing. 

I have zero experience with this kind of thing and lead a very level-headed and calm life.

Since I met her, she has moved a state away from her family and friends. I initially thought this was a very good thing, as I thought she could benefit from a fresh start. In the past year and a half, things have been great. We're renting a nice house together, she landed a major job that more than doubled her salary and really set her up for a career. We have a really good relationship and hardly ever fight or have disagreements.  She hasn't had any major mental health issues other than self image issues that we have just started to combat by going to the gym together. 

She does not have any friends in our new area and she works from home. She works at a job primarily dominated by older guys and it's hard for her to make friends there.

I have some controlling issues that are very known to me. Probably coming from being cheated on before to end a relationship. Whenever her old friends contact her, I get a little tense and don't support it very much. Mostly, because I don't know these friends and my brain automatically assumes that they will tempt her back to her old ways of drugs and not making a life for herself. 

I know that this is an issue and I have been trying to fix it within myself.

However, tonight she was asleep after drinking a decent amount and someone called her phone. I asnwered it and it was a male voice. Curious and probably stupidly, I woke her up and asked who it was. She was drunk and groggy from sleep and didn't give a straight answer cut eventually told me who it was and I was satisfied. However her grogginess and mumbling caused a lot of miscommunications and voice raising. Even tho I was satisfied, it escalated into her saying that she hates her life and that she can't have any friends and she wants to kill herself. She kept trying to lock herself in the bathroom but I wouldn't let her, knowing what might happen.  I was ready to call 911 while holding her from grabbing knives but eventually calmed her down and she fell asleep. 

I feel awful about this. I love her so much and never want to hear her say those words. Now I'm sitting next to her, planning to stay up all night to make sure she doesn't do anything crazy. 

How can I help her? I am afraid to get others involved because I feel it might end our relationship and this has been a one time thing so far. 

I am at a loss and don't know what to do. I'm wondering what will happen when she wakes up. Not sure if she'll be calmed down or keep on scaring me. Thank you in advance :("	tguy7650	post	38.157881598871015	male	White	0.0041932640597224236	na	na	na	3	MentalHealth

"Hi, I’m glad you’re asking for help! Having a partner that isn’t doing well can be really draining.

That said, I think working on your “controlling issues” is number one here. You can only work on yourself—you can’t fix her mental problems for her. But if she doesn’t have any friends in your new area, it’s likely she doesn’t have like ANY independence, which means she doesn’t have the ability to regulate herself/make herself happy/choose to interact with her support system. And it sounds like you are discouraging her from new friendships, whether you want to or not. So, please, get yourself a therapist or psychiatrist or some kind of mental health professional and talk through these controlling issues. You can only help yourself. And then encourage her to get a therapist too—she can work on things like her own mental health and her independence, with your support."	tguy7650	reply	na	na	na	0.0041932640597224236	strong	no	no	na	MentalHealth

"For a while I felt like like almost every interaction I had with someone was that they hated me. I remember feeling like everyone was being rude and disrespectful and felt just complete hatred from everywhere I went.

I didn’t believe it though, I felt like this was some anxiety or some cognitive distortion because I felt like I didn’t feel right.

And now almost a year later I feel a lot better and notice that I don’t really have those symptoms like before and it’s like all of a sudden everyone nice to me again

"So I (20F) have been depressed on and off since I was probably like 15. There's no specific reason why, no big trauma or anything. But it persists regardless.

I started going to college like a year ago and it feels so impossible to do. I look around and all my friends are doing so well, they are all keeping up with their classes and taking the time to study and everything.

It makes me feel like shit. I don't know why it's so hard for me to do even one subject at a time. Even when I'm not depressed, I'm always behind on all the shit I have to do. I feel lazy, like I could do it if I wanted to but it feels so fucking overwhelming, even thinking about it makes me feel tired. I have a big exam in a couple days and I haven't even started to study, I can't bring myself to do it, I don't have the energy or the will. And I also feel horrible because I want to help around the house, I want to do chores so my mom will be at least a little bit less overworked. But most days it's hard enough getting out of bed, so I don't clean or anything. The guilt I feel is immense.

I don't know what the point of anything is anymore. I don't know why I would want to keep living, if I'm never going to be able to get my degree and actually get a job that pays a decent salary.

I'm lucky that I have parents who love me and don't plan on kicking me out anytime soon, probably never. But I want to be able to sustain myself at some point. I don't want to be a burden. I don't want this to be my life forever. I feel so trapped.

"So I'm a 17 year old male and I understand that this age should be the peak of my emotions and hormones however throughout most of my life I've found myself unable to feel much at all. Happiness and sometimes anger are the only emotions I've found myself be able to feel most of the time. In the past 5 years I've cried at most 3 times, and I feel like that isn't normal for a kid my age. It's not as if my life has been super good all this time seeing as I've had multiple people that were super close to me pass away and even then I barely felt a shred of emotion.

A lot of the times when I feel sad is because I force myself to because in those situations I find it weird that I don't feel anything and most of the time I find myself smiling in situations where I should be crying but it's not like I want to be smiling or want to be happy all the time, I feel like I'm getting burnt out of emotions because since I'm always happy I find it hard to be truly happy and a lot of the time I find myself questioning if I'm even having fun or if that's just become a default state for my body.

Even playing games that I would be able to play for hours on end gets boring in like 15 minutes and I often end up just staring at my monitor without anything on it or just put on some video that I am super interested in and just forget to listen to what the video is saying.

I’ve struggled with Anxiety and Depression for years. However, I have always felt there’s something more to it.

(I’m exaggerating and joking of course but you get the picture). 

I don’t even know how to approach my doctor/GP about it. Surely I can’t say “I think I have about 20 things. Can I be assessed for them all?”

Sometimes the feelings of loneliness can be a symptom of other forms of emotional pain. If there are things in your life or in your past that make you feel isolated, that feeling of isolation can persist even if you find people to interact with. If you have depression, it can make you feel alone regardless of who you're with.

I am a 23 yo female, currently at my final year in dental school, barely a month away from deliberations, with a load of clinical goals to complete in these couple dozen days in order to pass my year.. 

The anxiety I've been having about my performance and advancement is pretty strong and crippling, I wake up every morning startled, distressed and fearful, flooded with negative emotions , the positivity monologues don't work anymore, I feel self pity and weakness and am on the verge of tears all day every day..

My appetite is totally gone, as well as my sleep, and when I do doze off it's never more than 3 hours where all I dream about is clinic and exams... 

I've started having the mini ""anxiety attacks"" more frequently, two in the last week (both happened while I was working on my shift ), they last 15 minutes at most, begin with a hyperventilation and leave me with a very numb right hand that I'm not properly able to move. 

Overall, I am in a very vulnerable and miserable state, I am extremely scared of failing this year and it's  grandly affecting my work and efficacy..

i am also terrified of getting sick and i cant tell if im just hungry or my stomach hurts or if its from nerves but i just cant eat and when i do i feel almost sick to my stomach. i dont know if something is wrong with me but it seems like everything in my life is unusual or off today

Look up ways to activate your parasympathetic nervous system. You are struggling with fight or flight which is the sympathetic nervous system. I can give you some examples on how to help activate it: meditation (I do guided meditation I find on YouTube), practicing breathing through my belly, paying attention to where my tongue is in my mouth (should be on the bottom, not top), and going out in nature.

"I've been deconstructing all the toxic shit I grew up with for the past 2 years, and I find myself unable to let go of my anger at my last ex & my family, because:

● in 2020 my younger sister & her husband set me up with him because he was his best friend, and they both assured me he was a fantastic person who would treat me well;

● (TW TW TW) the ex love-bombed me for 6 months (though I didn't recognize the signs at the time), suddenly became emotionally abusive for the last one (because he refused to accept that I didn't change my career path to suit his personal preferences), which culminated in him telling me he didn't give a shit that I was suicidal, that I was ""just another woman who doesn't want to work"", and after him pretending to want to work on things in the presence of the therapist while I was in the hospital recovering from my SUICIDE ATTEMPT but being abusive again on the phone, he dumped me via text as soon as I was discharged. He never ONCE apologized, for anything.

● I took screenshots & sent them to my sister, who didn't have much of a reaction. I know she showed them to her husband, so I KNOW he saw what he's REALLY like. Despite all that, my brother-in-law is still best friends with him TO THIS DAY, and was best man in his wedding last fall apparently.

● Apparently my sister is 100% fine with her husband being BEST FRIENDS WITH MY ABUSER.

I periodically find myself wanting to find ways to reach out to him to say what I need to say, because I never got the chance to stand up for myself, because he blocked me everywhere immediately after dumping me like the fucking coward he is. And I was also still very very passive at the time & would never have done it.

I saw one of my BIL's FB posts from 2022 about him watching a sports game with his ""brother from another mother"", my ex. I almost commented ""Friendly reminder that your brother from another mother is an abuser"", but I didn't.

I keep wanting to call them out on this shit. I feel betrayed I guess. I just NEED to express it, and never found the courage to, for fear of burning my family bridges, and for fear of them telling me to move on/stop being so sensitive/be the bigger person/forgive him/insert-other-toxic-conservative-Christian-""positivity""-here.

I just want to aggressively take a screenshot of that post, make my comment, and DM my BIL to call him out. Or something. Idk.

"I’m moving into a nearby city and got an offer to join someone’s lease via Facebook. I visited the site in person and met the people as well. Seems like a decent place, good neighborhood, and I can see myself getting along just well with the guys currently living there. 

The last time I lived with roommates was a couple of years ago in college (before I moved in with a family member). My experience living with others was mixed but what makes me nervous this time around is that I met these guys on Facebook and have no previous relationship with them. 

Over the last 48 hours I’ve had a lot of anxiety about the move and am thinking it’s maybe a mistake to proceed with a move at this time. I’m really risk averse too so I want to avoid putting myself into a situation I will regret later. It was such a hassle to find a room in the first place and now I’m having a lot of second thoughts. 

Any advice or perspective on this would be appreciated :)"	lemonsocks101	post	30.978154888506356	male	White	0.018258439376950264	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth

i was nicotine free for 3 years until the other night i for some reason just thought i should take some hits from a vape, so i did take about 5 hits. i also started to have an anxiety disorder a little after i quit the first time and i know think that i’m going to have awful anxiety for the next couple months. if i just took 5 hits would it be possible to have anxiety for months? weeks? or am i overthinking giving myself anxiety	Revolutionary-Sock18	post	39.96452240906349	male	White	0.998245358467102	na	na	na	0	MentalHealth
"Over the past 2 years I have been slowly trying to work on my mental health while in school and working. I have people pleaser tendencies and abandonment issues from my parents not being emotionally available. those have been my main focus as well and self worth and discovery as a result of those. I have struggled a lot with feeling socially outcast for my whole life having moved far distances multiple times throughout my schooling. I have made lots of progress though i find myself constantly trying to find people to distract myself and validate me to this day.  

Recently I had over one of my only close friends that I hadn’t seen for a while. Late in the night we got talking and he told me that during high school I was the stereotypical “nice guy” to other people. (I think it is relevant to mention that I just recently finished grade 13.)That people I saw daily would go behind my back to make me feel bad and leave me out. And that this happened throughout my high school experience with almost every “close” friend I have ever had. I would spend about half of my income to make sure everyone was enjoying themselves. 

I have been thinking a lot, having had one of my biggest fears that I have struggled with for years and only recently got somewhat through by convincing myself I was overthinking too much. At this point I’m not really sure what to do. I am still in close contact with a few of the people who ditched me almost on the daily. I don’t know if I should cut contact. I’m just lost at this point. 

Any advice would be great."	Willing-Survey-7094	post	23.164008028790523	male	White	0.9816395044326782	na	na	na	2	MentalHealth
"Being the ""nice guy"" or not doesn't matter a whole bunch. What others do or say behind you back may have an affect but nothing stronger than what you present.

"Personally i think the ""nice guy"" trope is an overblown concept that is one of the idioms of alpha male ideology.   
That said, you should have some boundaries and be able to have some idea of who you are, what you want, and who and what you want to become. All for yourself, somewhat independent of others, never wholly obviously but somewhat, to an extend.  
Since you are working on yourself, that will come, as will the assertiveness.

Hola! (Sorry for my English) I will start taking venlafaxine in two months and im sooo terrified about the side effects and the withdrawing. I will  travel to japan in October for 6 months and im not sure if is this 3 months left are time enough to test the drog and see if it works for me.

"I took venlafaxine for about three months. I can't guarantee what it's going to be like for you. 

For me, side effects were okay. I had trouble sleeping and was sweating a lot during the night, that went away after less than a month.
After three months I decided this isn't the right antidepressant for me. 

I would say three months is a good time for judging results. It's probably only going to be a problem if you decide you don't want to continue taking it. Then there's probably no time to try out another drug and you're probably going to feel some effects from the withdrawal. For me, it was bad for a week and then completely fine afterwards. 

I think 3 months is a bit short to make sure everything is perfectly adjusted and working, but it really depends on your body. I would ask your doctor for their opinion. And make sure you do your research on health care in Japan so you know what to do in case you're having problems. I hope it works out for you."

"i've been on venlafaxine for about 18 months now. I've found it helps keep my head above water yknow. Side effects are different for everyone, but personally, when they were initially prescirbed it was to be taken at nighttime, which turned out to be a massive no no for me. I couldn't sleep despite being exhausted. My limbs were restless, this is gonna sound weird but i felt like my bones were too tight, like i needed to stretch them constanly at nighttime. Honeslty that was torture, but after talking about it to my consultant (different doc to the one who prescribed), he changed it to take in mornings and havent had any other side effects from it. 

I will say withdrawls are a sucker tho, if i miss maybe 2 days in a row, i find myself light headed, super low and hopeless, on edge, like something big is constantly about to happen, not really attached to reality, i feel detached and almost like i might reach out to touch something and my hand will just pass right through it like a ghost."

I haven’t lived a bad life, In fact I’ve been so privileged to be where I am. Surrounded by people I love, and that love me. But there’s a hole in my chest, not dark nor light. I explored it once, and found it’s color to be gray. Like the color of stone after being masoned and constructed. I thought a lot about why I feel this odd hole. I’ve read a lot of people describe it as a dark pit, but mines not like that. I think I have people I love and that love me. But I’m no one’s first pick. I never will.

To be loved and cared for is a wonderful feeling of comfort.  Surrounding ourselves with people who care of for us feels safe and secure. That would be a solid anchor to branch out from. If you fall, they will catch you. The feeling you feel is the desire to have someone that is fully devoted to you. A mason can build a wall of stone, but to be in love adds the polished finish to it.

"I have a younger brother who has just turned 28 but he’s in a challenging spot that I’m unsure how to help with. 

I love the guy. But he’s always had a hard time fitting in.  All the way back to elementary school he’s always been a bit neurotic.   Self critical.  Afraid of challenges.   As a family member, I’ve always tried to walk the fine line of offering support without robbing him of the chance to grow into his own. 

A few years ago I was hopeful when he moved off to Austin with some roommates.  But a year later, he moved off on his own and has spent the last 2 years working from home in almost total isolation. 

Hanging out with him, he can’t find social “tempo” around people he doesn’t know.  He’s always anxious and people pleasing and doesn’t have the tool kit or confidence to go facilitate interactions out in the wild.  And when he talks about going places on his own, he panics and bails out and that just adds to the negative experience expectation. 

I don’t see this as mild social anxiety.  
This is “mentally remaining a child into adulthood.”

… his interests.  His confidence… His home decor.  Even his clothing choices are out-of-sync with adulthood.  

My fear is that I feel like this is a juncture in life where he needs to be solving this.  I’m worried that the longer he sits out of the loop, the further he’s gonna fall behind.  He needs to be on spaces where he’s interfacing with the world and being “socialized up” into adult identity but that isn’t what I see occurring.   

It looks to me like he’s crouching backwards, getting further out of touch, and becoming out of sync with his age. 

He isn’t dating or working a job with advancement possibilities or that facilitates upward growth. 

And I wouldn’t care about any of it if I thought he was happy.    But he’s not.  He’s miserable and afraid and on a downward path.  Calling home to ask for help on everything from banking to doctors appointments.   

What I want some advice on is this…
Where do you send someone or what’s an environment where people can just “get reps in” or “practice” on the daily. 

How do you begin to reintroduce someone into society so they can sync up with the pack again sufficiently as to live a functional life. 

Fuck… where do people go to make friends as adults…

I’ve been spending more time with him but I can’t pause my own life.     I’ve considered asking him if he wanted to move down the street from me (2 hours away) just so he can have a “social in” and start practicing… but I don’t know if that’s the move or even if he’d want that.  

I’m trying to find the right balance between “reliable resource” vs “babying” vs “tell him to get his shit together and go figure it out.”

Just looking for suggestions.

"The truth is, you can be super supportive and caring, and that will help in the short term. But ultimately this is up to him. You can only do so much before the rest is on him. If he is truly miserable and unhappy, the only way he is going to get out of that is if he wants to and tries to. He has to do it himself. You can’t and don’t have the power to do it for him. All you can do is be a good brother and support him. 

For meeting people as an adult, still trying to figure that out. It’s a lot more difficult than being in school where you have forced interaction all day. People are busy and most are consumed by their work and life."	Beneficial_Net_6139	reply	na	na	na	0.9985830783843994	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealth

He is basically a Hikkikomori… it won’t change unless he wants it. I got out of it thanks to group therapy for social phobia (CBT) and then volunteering.

"I genuinely hate people, the only person I can stand being around is my partner. When I'm at work, I put on a face, pretending to be an outgoing goofball and they're none the wiser. I work in customer service so it really sucks for me, I don't think I have a superiority complex but maybe I do, the thing that drives me to hate people is most things I think are common sense people just don't understand. I literally have to explain things like they're five.

I feel like I'm surrounded by idiots and it's infuriating. I don't like small talk, I'd rather have a conversation about a genuine topic, it seems most people I've met don't have the capacity and heaven forbid you talk about a sensitive topic, if they disagree, they lose their minds. You can't have a debate with someone nowadays with it devolving into an argument. I like to debate, I like to change my point of view based on new information or a new point of view.

"Woo hoo! I love celebrating small victories. Any chance to do a little happy dance for yourself is a good time.

For what it’s worth, I have a terrible time getting myself to brush my teeth. I don’t know what it is about that one aspect of personal hygiene, but it just always slips my mind. It’s not a sensory issue, or a mobility issue, and my bipolar disorder is pretty damn well managed by medication but it’s still been a thorn in my side. Hadn’t been to the dentist in over a decade either until two weeks ago when I had to get one tooth pulled and get a root canal/crown on another. 0/10 would not recommend. HOWEVER, the point of this rambling narrative is that I recently got a quip electric toothbrush that syncs to an app on my phone. It seemed silly at first, but I’m starting to love it. The brush has a built in timer so that you brush adequately and evenly around your mouth, you can set reminders in your phone, and the app even gamifies things a little bit by rewarding you with points every time you brush that can be redeemed for stuff in their store (replacement brush heads, travel cases, floss, etc.) it also looks really cool (I got the all black metal one)."

I went to a new doctor 8 months ago since my asthma was getting more severe and had switched health insurance plans. The doctor perscribed me a medication to take to help with allergies and asthma. I took it for several months and after about a month started to get depressed. I had a physical scheduled and decided to talk to the doctor about it then. Went in for the physical and I attempted to speak with the doctor about the depression but was told I would need to schedule a seperate appointment to discuss it. A few weeks later I was talking with one of my family members whos a M.D. They informed me that the medication I was taking is known for causing depression and shouldn't have been prescribed it with my previous bipolar diagnosis. I felt like an idiot because I didn't read the side of the bottle that had the side effects or even look up the medication. I immediately stopped taking the medication but the depression stayed and now I was worried about going into a manic episode after the depression. I went back for my follow up appointment and explained everything that was going on and how I think the new meds were what started this. The doctor reads my chart and tells me I shouldn't have been perscribed that medicine with a bipolar diagnosis, I was at a loss for words since she had perscribed me the medication. It was as if she didn't read my medical file before seeing me for both appointments. Then told me I would need to go to a psychiatrist for my depression and bipolar disorder; I now have to wait 2 months to see a psychiatrist. I know I am at fault for not looking into the side effects but I would have thought the doctor wouldn't have perscribed me something that would trigger my bipolar disorder or not offering any help when I went back for it. Now I have to hope that the manic episode doesn't hit or at least before I go to the psychistrist. Sorry for the rant, I needed to get it off my chest.

You're 13, you'll be very hormonal for a while now, and that's perfectly normal. If you want to cut back on it the only thing you can really do is practice self control. Put your phone and electronics away when you're not using them and start trying to build good habits like reading, exercise, and just socializing with friends and new people. Masturbation is a normal thing that everyone does, but if you feel like it's excessive, feel free to cut back on it. Just don't feel too bad about it.

Im new here and i have a question about depression.

I no longer want to die, but my only reason for living is to spite a world that actively puts in the effort to encourage me to off myself. But, that also means i have totally and utterly given up on ever achieving or just simple things like having regular showers.

"I don’t believe I’ve been abused in my childhood as I don’t remember anything bad happening nor do I have a reason to, but how would you know about abuse occurring as a baby or at a very young age? I have OCD and I get intrusive thoughts about every possible topic and this is one of them at the moment.

  
This is relevant because I remember reading about how sexual abuse increases the risk of homosexuality and/or transgenderism, however I know that I was born this way. I was a very effeminate child and I have always been interested in men, so I don’t even know when said abuse could have happened. Both of my parents are lovely, educated people, though they discouraged me from being effeminate. So I can’t think of anything that would have caused me to be born with gender dysphoria and attraction towards men, other than nature.

"I (24F) have had anxiety my entire life and recently was diagnosed with OCD. I also have ADHD (unmedicated due to physical heath issues) and a slew of physical health conditions that left me severely disabled for more than a year (although I'm much better now). I'm also probably autistic. 

this time last year i was doing pretty good - had a good friend group, a job I liked, my health had finally improved enough for me to go out and have fun, and just generally felt pretty stable. last august I got into a relationship that went to hell in a handbasket very quickly. we loved each other but were really really incompatible and made each other miserable and we were stressed to the breaking point constantly. he broke up with me in november and I had a mental breakdown. there was a ton of other stuff going on with this relationship I wont get into but I was crushed by guilt and grief. I was crying anytime I was alone (including at work), I had no energy, thought about ending it all, didn't eat or sleep, etc for a few months. 

through time and therapy I'm doing better from that breakup - not 100%, but maybe 90%. I know it was right for him to break up with me and the last 10% is mostly grief of losing him as a friend. I have a fantastic support system (I live with my best friend of all time, my parents are great and live 5 minutes away, and I see a large group of very good friends consistently), I love my job, I love my apartment, I excercise regularly, I go to therapy weekly, I'm on meds for OCD, I have fun and engaging hobbies.. my life is as good as it's ever been, if not better. 

my mental health has been fairly unstable for nearly a year now (since my ex and I got together basically, it was a stressful relationship from day 1. I lost 8 lbs the first week we were together yikes) but in the last month it's taken a turn for the worse. my roommate was out of town and I had a really bad day and ended up hurting myself and in a panic drove to my moms house because I couldnt be alone. since then I've been much, much worse. I've had multiple nervous breakdowns, I dont feel stressed until the slightest thing goes wrong and then I cant handle anything at all, and I'm afraid to be alone. I cant leave the house without checking everything multiple times and I'm constantly worried about house fires. on wednesday I had a nervous breakdown that led to me self harming and my roommate had to take me on a walk to calm me down. I'm glad we live by a hospital because I know i looked like i was on a bad trip and at least by the hospital it looked like I was just someone who was going on a walk from being in the hospital. I've been smoking weed every night to take the edge off and I usually only smoke with friends on the weekend. I've been waking up every day at like 4am and not sleeping after that and I'm exhausted and the weed isnt helping. I'm not suicidal but I have self harmed. I feel like im going insane tbh, like I don't recognize my own brain. 

this all just feels so sudden and I'm so confused. I was doing better, I've never felt this crazy before and other than being alone for a night there was no inciting incident. the OCD diagnosis was about 2 weeks ago and I havent been on meds long enough for any real change yet but it cant just be a side effect cause it started beforehand. I cant tell if this is self inflicted (like am I just doing this for attention?) or if this is real. I'm obviously gonna talk to my therapist about it but I dont see him until wednesday. I feel too self aware for such a rapid decline to be real.

"I’m not too sure how much this will help in your current situation, but I bring headphones to places I know will make my social anxiety spike (supermarkets, clothing stores, basically anywhere) and I listen to music.

I couldn’t go to the supermarket alone for years but one day I had to, so I grabbed my headphones, turned on my music, and got what I needed. Check out was hard but I did that too. Now I’m at a point where I can go to the store in my town without the headphones. You can’t complete get rid of or control anxiety, which blows, but you can make it easier to manage.

Slow breathing can help with awkward social situations and phobias. You can get good and relaxed, then imagine yourself in a situation that makes you nervous.  Doctors recommend a simple exercise - breathe gently through the nose, 6 sec inhale and 6 sec exhale.  
You can also slow your breathing just before and during a conversation.

"English isn't my native language so sorry for any mistakes i make. Sorry if this isn't important enough to post here.

I'm a 13 year old girl, living an average life. I'm overall average. Average looks, average grades, average everything. The past 5 or 6 years i've felt how my mental health has been getting worse and worse. I'm unable to take care of myself most of the time. The simplest tasks make me tired and annoyed. I'm bad at communicating with anybody outside of friends and family. I left my father when i was around 6 or 7 and have been living with my mom in an old, small, soviet-style apartment complex. It sucks to live here. There's a lot of mold on the walls and old wallpaper that's tearing off.

My father was a heavy drinker and a pedo. He used to set up cameras to watch my two older sisters sleep and shower. He used to grope them and me, hit my mother and sisters, yell and throw objects around the house. I was raised to believe violence is always the answer and i don't think i can ever get rid of that mindset.

I've been to therapy and have stayed in a mental health institute for around 11 days. I regularly smoke and drink to cope. I take some sort of medication for my mental health (not sure what they're supposed to do tbh).

I don't like talking about my problems directly to anyone, and it's hard to form a decent relationship with people. I can't be left alone with my thoughts and constantly need someone to distract me from the real world. I was told i'm more intelligent than other kids my age, but i assume that's just because of trauma. I don't know what to do atp.

"Above else, it's excellent that you escaped from your abusive father! I hope that your mother gives you lots of support!

Doctors are people - like you and me - and they can sometimes make mistakes, and not every medication works for each person. However, most of the drugs need time to help - as far as I know 2 weeks of regular consumption is a minimum to feel any difference. Don't feel discouraged and trust that your doctors want the best for you.

I can understand how cigarettes and alcohol may seem to help but please keep in mind that in the long run you'll need to rely on your own emotions - not the ones induced by addictive substances.

Definitely stick to your relationships, of course given they are not toxic.

Also - being ""average"" isn't something negative. Some people blossom and excel very late in their lives or find their specialties after decades.

"I can definitely assume it's connected to your diagnoses considering the fact that you may not have come to full terms with it just yet and those ""episodes"" you have are the best way your body can handle such low emotions and thoughts. 

We don't realize it right away day to day, minute by minute, that our mood is like water and the thoughts like a hand; one touch can create a ripple effect in our patterns of thought leading us to feel all kinds of things. This is obvious of course, but when we analyze it this way we can begin to understand that it's a way for our brain to process information and a lot of it gets delayed sometimes depending on your ability to know what it is that you're feeling. When you know and can understand what it is, you disconnect yourself from the feeling or thought, realizing that it is not you; but merely a reflection of the way your mind has been set up over time by the way of many things. Maybe too much screen time. Maybe not enough nutrients. Maybe just your serotonin levels are low.

The bottom line is that it should be fairly normal as long as your thoughts are backing up some negative or harmful scenario or stressor.

I was talking to a acquaintance recently, and they bluntly said “I really do not want to be your friend.” For reference I used to be in local theatre, and she was also but I never really fit in. Although I am not necessarily mad, I am rather miffed that they simply refused to give someone a chance to be a friend. Is what they did a tad cruel or am I just being a little bitch?

"For the last few days my close friend, who I talk on FaceTime with literally every night, often for at least an hour, is acting very different. The best way I can describe it is that she’s acting very grandiose, when shes never been someone to even mildly brag about herself before. Shes having trouble seeing things for how they really and isn’t believing anything besides what she’s saying. I’ll explain.

All of a sudden shes saying doesn’t want to work. She doesn’t see why she should have to get up, leave her house, work, and do what others want her to do. I thought she was joking when she first said this, bc yah, everyone feels this a teeny bit on those hard days. But she genuinely doesn’t think SHE (more than anyone else) should have to work. Meanwhile she just graduated with a specific degree, she obviously had ambitions and wanted to work. She also talked a lot about how jobs are “below her”, when that’s never been her. For years she’s literally helped her mom with cleaning gigs for extra money. She’s not someone who thinks she’s too good for things!

Another example: she was fighting with her mom bc her mom wanted her to clean up after herself. Put her dishes in the sink, wash her own clothes, put her stuff back after using it in a shared room. Keep in mind, my friend and her mom are usually very close and they have always split house chores between them. She’s never just not done anything like this before. My friend said these tasks were outrageous, and that her mom should just leave her alone completely. When I pointed out, she’s living there rent free at newly 25, works a “part time job” that totals maybe 6 hours a week, her mom gives her gas money, buys and cooks her meals, etc, she didn’t see why cleaning up a little was the least she should do. She would listen to me talk about how everyone in the world has to do these basic things, so it’s not insane for her mom to ask her to just clean up after herself she would just nod. And one second later she would launch into “so I need to lay some hard boundaries with my mom, because she can’t ask me to be her slave” etc etc

Another example: she says she doesn’t have to work on applications or boosting her resume, bc the grad school shes thinking about applying is “begging” her to come, and her going there would be “a gift” to this school. I swear to god she’s never been like this. Upon pointing out, she had lower grades in college, NO job experience at all, let alone in the field she studied, she says “I’m certain I will be the best in my class. I know more than anyone else about [her field]” 

There are other examples too, like thinking this random boy who ghosted her is in love with her and desperately trying to get with her. Suddenly thinking she is literally the most attractive person. She will see a model or someone on social media and be like, “their not nearly as beautiful as I am, I can’t believe they have that boyfriend or got that modeling gig over me”.  She also brought a bikini to her dads auto shop to try it on bc she said she just couldn’t wait. Her mom was horrified that she did this, and when I said literally wtf, she didn’t see how it was weird at all. She used to be kind of self conscious. It’s just really odd. 

Please note: she has NEVER in our friendship of two years been like this. She’s not just being a conceited asshole like I know it seems from these. She’s literally disconnected from reality. It’s like she thinks that her life situations are completely different than what they are. Please please help me figure out what’s going on!"

"Therapists often recommend self-help to go with their therapy.  
  
The beauty of self-help is that you have a variety of low cost, low risk things that can be combined with each other, and with standard treatments with office visits. While it's not clear at this time that any one of these things is as effective as an antidepressant, it's common sense that if a variety of reasonably good things are combined with each other, they will have considerable effect.  
I can't tell you exactly what you need. There's no one size fits all solution. I can tell you though that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits.

A year and a half ago my Dad was diagnosed with late-onset bipolar syndrome after he was forced to go to the hospital. My dad was then put on a heavy dosage of Lithium, and the dosage hasn't changed despite the fact that he hasn't had another episode since. Ever since my Dad started taking lithium, he's had a lot less functionality and has also had a lot less energy than he used to. He hasn't been able to hold a job and even struggles to care of himself. One thing though is that he hasn't had a manic episode since he started taking his medication. This is why I want to know if there is any way to lower his lithium dosage because clearly, he is taking too much. I've tried to ask him to ask his psychiatrist about it but he always seems to forget to do it. I don't want him to slip back into mania but I think it's reasonable to say that he should get a lower dosage. What steps could I take to try to lower his dosage, should I get in direct contact with his psychiatrist, should I do something legal, or do y'all think that the lithium isn't the reason for my dad's problems? 	tytpop	post	24.178341567583395	female	White	0.996728777885437	na	na	na	2	MentalHealth
"To the best of my knowledge, for lithium to work as an antimanic medication, it does have to be at a pretty high dose. Lower dosages may be more suited to people with worse depressive symptoms. 

Also, one person might take a relatively high dose, and another takes a moderate dose, but the person on the moderate dose can have higher levels of lithium in their blood. It depends on how the individual tolerates it as well. His psychiatrist will be taking regular blood tests to monitor both the amount of lithium in his system, and how his kidney function is doing. If there are no problems, and he's not reporting significant and problematic side effects, they won't automatically reduce the dose. 

Most other treatments for mania are actually much worse for causing sedation. Antipsychotics are pretty notorious for it, and as far as mood stabilizers go, lithium is apparently the gold standard for mania. But that said, every person is unique and if it seems to be doing him more harm than good, you could ask him if he'd like your support to go and discuss this matter with his psychiatrist and potentially try another, better tolerated medication."	tytpop	reply	na	na	na	0.996728777885437	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth

"I want to clarify that I don't want to diagnose myself. I've done some research, but I'm not an expert. I'm naturally a self-aware person. I just want a second opinion to hopefully deny or affirm what I'm thinking.

For context, I laugh at inappropriate times. It doesn't really matter what it is, I'll laugh to ""cope"" I guess. There are three reasons why I'll laugh:


1) The irony of everything. When I'm having a depressive episode, sometimes my thoughts will become loud and cluttered. Reminding me of something horrible that's happened. And I'll laugh at the irony of my life. How it's one big movie with one tragedy after another. Sometimes I'll laugh when I do something stupid and self-destructive, because I know I'm doing it, but I do it anyway. It's almost uncontrollable. Almost. But I know that's not true. I think.

And what's worse is that on the outside, someone might think I'm crazy because it's out of nowhere for them. But for me, I'm constantly trying to get my thoughts to shut up.

2) I'm stressed. And tired. I'll laugh if I'm having an argument with my sister or mother. I'll laugh and smile if someone is screaming at me. I'll laugh if someone physically beats me.

3) I'm having a mental breakdown. Sometimes I snap. It's not common, and it's only at specific people, but my emotions can become out of hand. And I'll laugh. I'll feel like I'm losing my mind. And start thinking about things I can't even put into words. (Not of harming the person, for those wondering)


So what I'm *possibly* thinking is that it could be schizophrenia. Again, I don't want to diagnose myself, and I plan to seek a proper psychologist to confirm this. But, there have been other things I've been experiencing, such as:


1) Delusions. For a while, almost a year, I was in a fantasy. I don't want to go into too much detail, but long story short I was hearing voices. Not outside my head, but inside. And for a long time I believed someone was telepathically communicating with me. But something thankfully shattered my reality after months. However I was devastated by my own delusion that I built up in my head over that period of time. Even now, I have moments where I slip back into that very same delusion I can't seem to get rid of. For a long time, I strongly believed it. I'm at a constant battle for my sanity because of it. 

I've also on and off believed I could hear other people's thoughts from random people. This is uncommon though. 

2) Sometimes, only if I'm completely alone, I'll have moments where I respond to myself. I keep saying ""shut up"" to myself. Trying to make the thoughts stop. I'll talk to myself or repeat certain phrases/words from my mind. 

3) I'll feel extremely happy for no reason and giggle randomly. Or I'll have frantic movement around people. Sometimes I'll feel like choking them. Not to harm them, but just because. And I'll think of stuff that's weird to the average person. Or say and do things on impulse. I'll dance or move in a weird way to release the intense joy I'm feeling.

4) I see things in the corner of my eyes all the time. I keep mistaking things for a face or a body. Recently, a black shadow came from the kitchen hall and towards me. But when I looked at it, it went away. It could've easily been my hair in my peripheral vision, but this has only been happening more recently. Auditory hallucinations are extremely rare. But I have woken up to my mom screaming for me, only to find she was sleeping. 

Maybe it was someone outside, but it sounded too much like my mom, and it was definitely my name. I can't tell what's real sounds and what's my imagination sometimes. There have been no fully fledged hallucinations though. 


I should also mention, a mysterious family member of mine who's dead now, had similar symptoms. She would argue and talk to people who weren't there. Or laugh for no reason. But if it's genetic, for whatever reason, it's skipped a generation. Because my grandmother, mother, nor sister has it. It's only been me. Idk, maybe I'm overanalyzing things and taking them out of context. They could be caused by different disorders, but I feel like I'm slowly losing my mind, and I want to know what other people might think. Please help."

"Here's my story:

For the past few years I've struggled with maintaining a positive outlook on life, low energy levels, intrusive thoughts, terrible mood, difficulty feeling pleasure, and a lack of passion, drive and motivation. I've come to the realisation that many people in the western world today struggle with similar problems and have gone on a quest to determine the cause of this.

From what I have come to understand, the body and mind are intrinsically linked, i.e. your mind affects your body and your body affects your mind. Physical health and emotional health are intimately intertwined in what’s known as the mind-body connection.

In the context of the mind affecting the body I will provide some examples below:- People who go through traumatic heartbreak or loss of a loved one can experience chest pains,

\- Ongoing stress can increase the risk for hypertension, heart attack, or stroke

\- Anxiety causes the heart to race

These are but a few of the long list of bodily symptoms that the mind causes. Now, what I find that most people don't realise is that the body affects the mind, I'm not talking in terms of how attractive you are or what features you have but rather the functionality of the body - How much flexibility and strength do you have? Do you have an upright posture? Can you squat deeply? Can you comfortably touch your toes? More generally, **how well is your body's geometry**? Think back to when you were a kid and you could sit down cross legged on the ground for hours at a time, when you could play outside for hours on end without experiencing any bodily pain, and now think of your mental state at this time - because your body geometry was in perfect order, your mind was also in perfect order.

If you are depressed, I would bet that you have bodily aches all over, poor posture and a lack of flexibility and strength. When this is the case, it means your body has energetic blockages - the flow of your chi is disturbed and your mind becomes full of clutter. Negative thoughts become overwhelming and you become unable to function in the way that you desire, be it experiencing pleasure, feeling confident and courageous, or feeling love and compassion.

If this is you, I would recommend beginning yoga practice and remaining consistent with it. You will certainly see the benefits in both your body and your mind.

Late 30s, I just never want to leave the house. This has been going on for years and years. Not like agoraphobia, more like zero motivation. The days I enjoy the most are rainy days when my family has to stay inside, I just want to want to do things. Every event, birthday party, literally anything even a fun invitation out with friends… Everything is a chore And the entire day I think about how much I hate that I have to go out later. Last year I started an antidepressant, and for a few months, it changed my life, I don’t know if it was a placebo effect or what, but my relationship completely changed, I even cried once, because I was happy… Eventually, I started feeling back to my usual self, I increased my dose to the max, but nothing happened after that and now I take max dose of antidepressant, but still feel the same. During that time when I was “happy“ I started working out and that actually has stuck, I still work out five days a week which I’m shocked I get the motivation to do… But I do it at home. My husband is super active, polar, opposite, up at 4 AM and doing activity after activity after activity… I’m so glad my kids have him. I do go along for the ride, but I’m never excited to do anything. When I was younger, I tried many different antidepressants, nothing worked… So I always struggled with the idea of am I actually depressed or an extreme homebody… I’m sure there is depression there, but why doesn’t any medication work. Maybe there is some thing else going on I don’t know… I’m 39 years old but sometimes I feel like my life is over… And I am physically fit and attractive by society standards. I just don’t want to leave my house or make plans or do anything at all. Is this what the rest of my life is going to look like? Just home and cleaning? I don’t know if I’m even asking anything. I’m just looking for answers.	ClaireFisher1983	post	19.453139746742096	female	White	0.9971081614494324	na	na	na	7	MentalHealth
"As you say, the problem is depression. If it were not, the good experience you had with that medicine would not have happened.

Even so, medication alone is not a very good way to treat depression. Exercise can help, but it's only one of the self-help methods that are good for depression.

Lifestyle expert Stephen Ilardi of the Univ. of Kansas talks about enjoyable ways to get exercise - long walks with family or friends, sports, and swimming,

The beauty of self-help is that you have a variety of low cost, low risk things that can be combined with each other, and with standard treatments with office visits. While it's not clear at this time that any one of these things is as effective as an antidepressant, it's common sense that if a variety of reasonably good things are combined with each other, they will have considerable effect.

I can't tell you exactly what you need. There's no one size fits all solution. I can tell you though that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits.

Video, below - details about self-help based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and lifestyle choices that help with depression - nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise, and social support, also traditional Asian methods.

Hello, I'm also in my late 30's and have struggled with major depressive disorder and ptsd to name a couple. I am on medication, but was told that it is possible that I'm one of those people who require a couple of different medications and regular therapy. I've followed through with this advice and for the most part I'm ok. There are days though where I do not want to leave the house or do anything at all. Like you I'm happy when my family is stuck inside with me and then I seem to have motivation to do things. But outside of that I struggle. What I find that helps me is I made a schedule list, when to get up, when to eat, when to rest when to get up again. It's really helpful on the days that it is just almost impossible to even think. Looking at something you've written yourself makes it feel a lot less demanding than if someone told you to. Keeping a regular schedule also just helps keep minor things in check so we can focus on bigger issues and learn how to resolve them. I highly recommend at least psychotherapy (talk therapy). I find that after I am able to verbalize what I'm struggling with, clarity usually follows. I hope you feel better soon and I'm sorry you feel like this. Please do what you can to take care of yourself for you and your family.	ClaireFisher1983	reply	na	na	na	0.9971081614494324	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealth
I really feel for you.  Can I recommend two books to check out?  The first is The Depression Cure, very straightforward suggestions from a clinical psychology professor.  The second is a bit more “out there”, but might help you shift your thinking.  It’s called Don’t Kill Yourself…Yet: Unleash the Seven Life Hacks to Crush Depression and and Anxiety NOW.  The first part helps you change your approach to shitty thoughts and the second helps you change how you deal with external forces that sap your life force.  You are not broken, but your life force has been depleted.  Those books might help you find out why and how to restore it.

"I’m in the Bible Belt of the US. I’m an alcoholic and have gotten treatment in the past, but this last relapse was especially bad and in a blackout I got into a physical altercation with a police officer. Felony obstruction and simple battery. I went to treatment at the only place that would accept me, a Christian program. I myself am not Christian, but I figured I could stick it out for 6 months and probably learn something. Also this place has influence in the justice system and it might help me legally to be here (that’s actually the primary reason I’m at this particular place)

Let it go. Only pick fights that will give you an actual advantage. There is no point of sticking your head up if it means you will lose out on your goals. There is nothing you can do to solve homophobia and other religious bigotry, so there is ZERO point of using an ounce of your mental energy to debate these things or to get angry.

"If you follow the safety rules, you'll be fine in a thunderstorm. There's no reason for you to worry about tornados.    
  
Phobias are very treatable, although overcoming one can take patience and persistence.  
  
Psychiatrist David Burns is the self-help author recommended most often by mental health professionals.  
  
Basically, therapy for phobias, explained in The Feeling Good Handbook by David Burns, is making a list of situations, ranking them according to how scary you find them, and using that ranked list as your objectives. Imagining a situation can be an objective. Start with something really, really easy.   
  
I'll suggest a set of objectives you can try. You can go to YouTube and get one of the videos that have audio of thunderstorms. It may sound crazy, but some people love to hear that sound. You can listen with the sound turned way down at first. The following objectives are listening with the sound gradually louder and louder.  
  
You can do this with or without a headset  
  
The thing to remember is never go from objective A to objective B until you feel completely confident with A. Things that give you confidence are experience and slow breathing. There's enormous laboratory and clinical evidence  that slow breathing is effective for calming people down quickly.    
  
Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each."	Hella-Shot	reply	na	na	na	0.9976654052734375	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealth
All the situations in my life I really can’t tell anyone or else my family would be affected and who knows what will happen to me. It feels like there’s nothing I can do in this world and I’m pretty much done, I fantasize about sh and if I start again I won’t be able to stop for a while. I don’t even have friends that I can talk to I have a job and that’s pretty much it. I’ve been kicked out of my moms house and I have to go from one city to another for school, I got into a physical fight with my dad last month and that can’t escape my mind, I have a bad smoking habit, no social life, I barely eat some days but at least I’m living with my grandma and my dad. Sometimes I can’t help but feel like I’m faking my depression, sometimes my depression just feels as if I am “normal”. I would talk to my therapist about medication but my family is against that kinda stuff they wouldn’t want me to be on medication because of that stigma thinking “something is wrong” with me.

"The best thing is to see a doctor about this.  
  
A depression screening test  can be useful sometimes. KADS 6-Item online is for teenagers.  
  
I hope that you'll talk with your parents about this. I say that knowing that parents often fail to see depression in their children.  
  
It has become difficult for people to get therapy because of the demand, but you have options. A very good site called Healthline rates online services.  
  
  
If you can't see a therapist, self-help is better than nothing. A lot of people benefit from it. Self-help is a way to show you're serious that doesn't create friction in the family. In fact, it wouldn't be surprising if your parents liked some healthy changes in your behavior.  
  
  
Self-help can be educational for parents as well as kids. A good self-help book explains what therapy for depression is like.  
  
  
With depression, there's what seems like a Catch 22. People say, ""I know there are things that will make me feel better - getting exercise, taking care of myself, straightening up the house and cleaning, but I'm depressed and I don't have the energy.  
  
  
Here's the thing - very important. People do have energy when they're depressed - as much energy as they always do, but for some reason, the system is reluctant to let you use your energy.  
  
  
We have to use psychology to coax energy out of our systems. Psychology has some nifty tricks.  
  
  
A famous psychiatrist, Abraham Low, said that when we can't control our feelings we can still control our muscles. If you tell your arms and legs to get you out of bed or to the bathroom for a shower, they will obey.  
  
  
Try this when it seems that you're too tired to work. Lie on the couch, close your eyes, and get ready to work by imagining yourself working for 5 minutes.  
  
  
This is a motivation trick that's been used in behavior modification programs since the 1930s. If a task seems like it's too big, think of it as a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time, and start with something really, really easy. Cleaning - start by cleaning for 3 or 4 min and take a 5 min break. Homework - start by proofreading a paper or previewing a chapter you're going to read by looking at headings, sub-headings, etc.  
  
  
You don't have to be an athlete to benefit from exercise. As little as 20 min brisk walking a day can help, and you can add to that gradually so long as you don't make yourself sick of exercise with too much and quit. Steve Ilardi, the therapist/researcher who headed the lifestyle-depression project at the Univ of Kansas, talks about enjoyable ways to get exercise.  
  
  
If you go to Metapsychology, you can read a psychologist's review of Dr Ilardi's book (""splendid"").  
  
  
Of all the traditional mind-body practices (meditation, etc.), the one with the best evidence for affecting mood disorders is yoga breathing. Slow breathing is used for treating anxiety, depression, panic disorder, and PTSD. It's safe and it doesn't take any training.

Hello,

I am really struggling right now. I am married and we have 3 children together. I am a very anxious and hyper-vigilant person. It is hard for me to make any major life changes, such as deciding to move to a different city. I feel like a lot of things are too risky. If I were on my own, I would be more comfortable because if things don’t work out, I could always reverse and move back. This has caused major issues in my marriage. Example:

My husband and I are talking about buying a home. We live in a very HCOL area. I am an accountant and he is a civil engineer. We make decent money, but aren’t able to really save as rent is very high and we pay a nanny to watch our children. I work from home and he can easily find work in cheaper areas for the same pay (he is employed by the state). He wants to move to an area that has good schools and is much cheaper than where we live. It’s about an hour away. I see risk because it’s possible that I wont always have good career prospects working from home and may be forced back into an office. I asked him what we would do if this was the case and he said I should just focus on working from home. I love working from home and would try hard to stay this way, but knowing I won’t have the option of moving back in case it benefits my career sounds so risky to me. At first, I was excited, but as we discuss more seriously, I back out. He is getting very frustrated with me. As a fear driven person, when he gets annoyed or frustrated that I backed out, I try to get on board again. Then we get serious about a property and I back out again. Rinse, repeat.

My husband does not understand my anxiety. He is more spontaneous and feels like I am just manipulative. How do we address this together? Or is this my work alone? I feel so lost and suffocated.

Your insights are very appreciated.

Thank you!"	iamsn	post	29.317972224655236	female	White	0.9946933388710022	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
"Worrying is not thinking. It's just spinning your wheels. You're an intelligent person, and if you just get your problem-solving ability in good working order, you'll be able to work these things out.  
  
  
Statistics tell us what's best for people in general, not you as an individual.  
  
This article from the American Psychological Association says that most people with anxiety disorders do better with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) than with medicine.  
  
https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/medication-or-therapy#:\~:text=For%20anxiety%20disorders%2C%20cognitive%2Dbehavioral,improve%20outcomes%20from%20psychotherapy%20alone.  
  
Although self-help based on CBT has not been shown to be as effective as the standard treatments for anxiety with office visits, some people benefit from it. Authoritative Guide to Self-Help Resources in Mental Health, a book based on polls of more than 3,000 professionals, says that The Feeling Good Handbook by Dr. David Burns, a psychiatrist and cognitive therapy expert, is the one recommended most often by professionals.   
  
In recent years, there has been very encouraging evidence for therapeutic breathing, which can be combined with cognitive therapy methods for dealing with worrisome thoughts.  
  
When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.  
  
One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.  
  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.  
  
Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
Also, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.  
  
The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication.  
  
Don't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety.

Their reason for caring is because they are your family, that is what normal families do.

"Tw:suicide 

I'm disabled rn. I use a cane because I can't walk without a lot of pain. I've been in physical therapy for so long and I'm constantly in pain. Im unemployed because I can't work. I've been living with my parent and siblings. I've been told by multiple that im just a lazy mooch, I'm faking it, I should just get a job and deal with it. Constantly bring up that Im too lazy to even help around the house since I'm living here rent free. So I do the chores sometimes at the expense to my health and it makes it even worse. My sibling told me I should have been kicked onto the street a long time ago. I can't really buy my own food so I have to ask but every time I ask I'm treated like I'm being greedy and like I'm just inconveniencing them to go out of their way to buy me food. So I haven't been eating much. I purposefully make myself wait a while to eat so I don't go through the food as quick. People are excited for me that I'm losing so much weight but it's really because I'm not eating. I just constantly keep hearing lazy, mooch, useless. It doesn't seem like I'm getting better any time soon. Honestly every day that goes by the more and more I think about unaliving myself. I don't feel I deserve to keep being here. I'm so very tired. I'm not actually going to do it, i've got things I gotta do so I'm not dying, not for a long long time. I just really wish I could. I've considered leaving. I'm clearly a burden on the people here. I've got nowhere to go really though but honestly that sounds better than constantly being told I'm a burden. The thought of finding some sketchy dude to live with has crossed my mind, I've already discovered those kinda people aren't hard to find, and that's probably the most stupid idea I've ever had but honestly I cant do this anymore."	1800CutAHoe	post	17.85566668818609	female	White	0.9989950060844421	na	na	na	3	MentalHealth

Hang in there. Unfortunately your family will probably never understand and the best you can do now is make sure you are as mentally and physically healthy as you can be. Many towns have local or region specific resources foor food and transportation as well as general activities such as library programs etc. Maybe look into some groups on fb for region specific groups or programs?

"For context: I work in the UK and I'm also autistic  
  
The littlest things that people say or do get me down. I'm an admin worker who works adjacent to Social Workers who help support, predominantly elderly, patients once they are discharged from hospital. The social workers obviously have a very difficult and stressful job which among other things involves arranging care for sometimes negligent or even downright abusive families who will shout no end of abuse at these poor social workers. They also have to deal with a lot of risk as well, if they make a mistake a patient could very easily wind up dead. They do all this while being paid about the same amount as a high school teacher if not less (both need to be paid much more).  
  
This stressful work environment can understandably mean that they develop a thick skin and can sometimes be blunt in ways that they don't mean. One example of this is that one of my main jobs is to process referrals that are sent through the hospital to our team which I than have to reassign to one of our social workers to triage. The UK is sadly going through a social care crisis so they're simply isn't enough social workers to immediately pick up every single referral so as a result they can get frustrated when they're assigned too many referrals to triage. In rare cases some of them have shouted at me but more often it can be a blunt ""stop sending me any more triages"" (though some of them are thankfully always polite). This is a perfectly valid complaint and I know that they're not angry at me (they're angry at the system) but it's hard to not take it personally sometimes.  
  
Other examples where I feel like I'm overly sensitive at work include being upset internally that someone doesn't want to talk because they're busy. I feel especially bad about that because in a way I'm actually the one bothering them. I also sometimes feel uncomfortable when some of the social workers complain a lot. As I've said previously every single complaint about their work is valid but sometimes the tone of voice they use can make me uncomfortable which is why I often prefer to either work away from them or to turn up the volume on my airpods. Some of them also complain about things that have nothing to do with their work for example one person saying they didn't like when people called them during sick days because she thinks that means that they're just asking ""when are you going to be back at work?"" I also sometimes think that I'm left out by the team. It seems like people seem to prefer talking to other people and rarely seem to want to start conversations with me. I sometimes feel like it's often down to me to start conversations rather than the other way around. I wonder if that's true or if it's just all in my head.  
  
In non work situations I find that I get upset when people make fun of my interests (like my favourite films or books) as well as when people regularly point out that what I do wrong. I have a good friend at work (one of the other admin workers) who does both and often gives me unsolicited advice about things that I don't understand why he has to constantly bring them up for example making fun of me for watching movies on my computer or spending £7 on a DVD. These are stupid small nuisances but I nevertheless ruminate about them.  
  
A few of my managers have picked up on this struggle I have. In their words I struggle to not take things to heart. To the point where it's led to a couple managers making ""special considerations"" for me example insisting that I do a practice version of a spreadsheet for longer than my other colleagues despite by my other colleagues admission I picked it up quicker than they did. My best friend at work agrees that my managers are reluctant to give me as much work because they don't want to overwhelm me due to my autism which he than brushes off as them trying to be nice which just makes me feel worse.

"It's not your fault first of all. One of the biggest symptoms from what I read about people with autism is that they are very authentic and have a hard time seeing things in a gradient. 

What I mean by seeing things in a gradient is not percieveing everything black and white - by that I mean black or white. Things can be sometimes black and white at the same time. Neither bad nor good or differing variations of good and bad. 

I don't think it's a sensitivity issue even though it comes off as one I think it's a preoccupation with things being a certain way and expecting things to flow exactly as expected and being frustrated when criticism is given maybe not specifically to you but at the task at hand causing discomfort.

Everyone can feel frustrated regardless of if they have autism or not. You are not alone. If it is stressing you out alot and you need a break take it. Even though it may also be hard to break routine. I have a hard time letting go of work when scheduled myself. 

I don't know if I have an answer that can make things better and alot of what I said is based half on experience and half on assumptions so take it with a grain of salt. 

As someone with adhd and ocd for me overatimulation causes me to get really agitated really badly. Specifically my ocd gets worse when I get stressed I just can't seem to do things normally once I get an ocd attack - like I'll have trouble putting my cup of coffee down properly... So I can related to being overwhelmed. 

Like I said prior I never figured out the best answer and I've been avoiding people alot it tends to help me. Maybe it's not the right thing idk. 

At the end of the day it's not a you problem it's a them problem. Put yourself first give yourself a break.

"Hello, for starters I’m 22yo male and my gf is 20. She’s been physically abused when she was a child by her parents, both mother and father, they’d argue a lot she even tried to jump out of window when she was 6 to stop them from arguing. 

I guess you can make a pretty good picture about her parent’s mental health. Well I think there is a lot of mental illness in her family. Her mother is psycho at times like getting mad because of mess in the house ( even tough it’s clean) but not perfectly clean etc etc. 

My gf is alas so struggling with her self confidence, when she was 15 she was anorectic, then she ended up in a psychic ward with meds that she wasn’t taking because her mother took them away. She said it was making her zombie like etc, you know the drill. 

Well she went to collage last year and just finished first year. Her mother and brother is ultra-pressuring her to get a part time job and it’s making her really mentally unstable. She’s kinda awkward in general and it’s huge anxiety factor for her. ( I support her always and all the way everytime in everything). 

I myself work in country we live in but today she had a really bad breakdown (she used to hurt herself a lot). The tension is unbearable in this household and she said if she stays in this house she’s gonna kill herself. Another thing she said is that she doesn’t work around area we live in because she’s sick of people here. 

Today she said she wants to leave to Netherlands where we both previously worked. I told her she can’t go there alone (besides living with a various people from drug takers to criminals) she would have to arrange everything by herself which she never did. Me myself know how complicated everything is with agencies that can leave you in streets when u arrive to transport to work which is always and issues and million another things 

So I says I’ll go with her because she can’t go alone, there is one more factor, her mental health, I found her overdosed by pills one day and with cuts all over her body. She doesn’t handle stress and work related criticism well. Besides being scared of unpredictable people I’m scared she might kill herself there. 

For these reasons I don’t wanna let her go there and today she had a breakdown as I mentioned before. She proceeded to bang her head with shower gel and hitting her head with various objects which I stoped luckily. She said she wants to be alone she’s sick of everything and everybody here and she will runaway.(I always arranged everything for her etc.)

Update meantime I was writing did she just did like three super deep cuts I was fixing it for her. 

I don’t know what to do. Her mental her is not stable enough for her to leave and she will go home in some at home and she will kill herself. Help plz, I’m thinking about calling psychic ward or some shut"	UbbeY38	post	26.231820138326825	female	White	0.9880565404891968	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth

"possibly failed my online class

basically what the title says but idk what to do. I'm in an online class and I'm not sure if I've failed it or not because I'm waiting for my teacher to email me back about a possible extension/switching to a self paced version of the course so I can get it done.

A month or two ago, my parents told us we were moving and I became pretty depressed at the thought of leaving behind all my friends and everything I've known since I was 2. I stopped doing my assingments in my online class, and they've piled up really bad to the point where I got severe anxiety at the thought of even opening up the course on my phone.

 I feel like a failure because it was literally the easiest class ever. I've always been good in school and I've always been praised for it so it's really affecting me. I started crying when I found out I'd missed the deadline to submit work, and that I have 0's on more than half of the assignments, because I know I'll absolutely fail unless I'm given an extension. I really don't want to redo the course because I'm taking really difficult classes next year and won't have time to keep up with the online class. What do I do? I don't think I can talk to the school counselor about it because there's literally 2 days left of school and she's likely not there. I'm also worried that it's too late to ask for an extension because my teacher hasn't responded for a day, and ik i just have to wait, but I'm worried sick I've missed the deadline to ask. 

I really need someone to tell mw I'm not a complete failure, and that I'll work things out and that my teacher is just busy and will give me the extension when he's free bc I'm really stressed over this.

Don’t be anxious, let them take care of you… All of your worries, stress… Let it all go and let them help you get better. Look at it like a vacation for your mental health… Where there are no worries and no stress… There are hundreds of thousands of other people who feel the same exact way you do and there is help out there, it can get better.

"I don't want to seem like I'm minimizing your problem, but I can tell you that a particular thing that helps with suicidal feelings can also help with all the mood problems you mention, including CPTSD.  
  
Of course you should talk with a qualified professional, but there are things you can do on your own.  
  
The most important thing is knowing how to cope in a moment of crisis. It's very important to calm down. This will make you feel better and let you think clearly. A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical Behavior Therapy, which helps people who have BPD, recommends this - breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK.  
  
  
Simple distractions can help. The video below shows you distractions that can calm you down, also a safe hotline. No one will bother you if you call.

I (23F) met Anna (19F) in a psychiatric hospital six months ago. We quickly became friends and after our release we stayed in contact and met up a few times. She is very suicidal, self-harms and has other issues too. She would often text me that she was about to commit suicide/had already done something harmful, and each time i was worried and scarred, kept messaging and calling her. I told her to go back to the hospital, she finally did a month ago but left after a few weeks. Today she texted me saying she was afraid she her father would die because she put a bunch of painkillers into his drink after he got physical in a fight and now he was out cold. I begged her to call an ambulance. I didn't know what to do, if i called them and told the truth she would probably get arrestes. Finally i got her to call an ambulance, and her dad is okay, she didn't put too much. But the fear i was in while i was waiting for her to text back was terrible. My own mental health isn't the best and it spirals each time something like this happens. I deeply care about her, but i feel like i can't do this anymore. I want to cut contact with her, but when other friends did something similar she became suicidal/did serious self-harm. How should i tell her this?

">My own mental health isn't the best and it spirals each time something like this happens

For this reason you need to put yourself first, even if you care about her this isn't a healthy friendship for you to have. It seems to me she's either very reliant on you as a moral compass, leaning on you too much when you've got your own problems or she's enjoying dragging you into drama. Either way it's not healthy.

>when other friends did something similar she became suicidal/did serious self-harm.

How she reacts to you cutting contact is not your responsibility or fault. You can't control others reactions so please don't feel guilty for anything she does. Also the fact she's had other friends cut contact before this, it's likely she's treated other people like this in the past.

>How should i tell her this?

I'd just be honest, that this friendship is effecting your mental health in a bad way and you need to concentrate on yourself for now. Maybe tell her you'll get back into contact with her when you're in a better place (if that's something you'd like to do). I'd also advise blocking her, because you'll be waiting for the messages to pop up if you don't cut contact completely.

One of the things I have learnt from Psych Ward admissions is that they discourage close friendships for this reason. Within the environment of the ward, everything is equalised , everyone is vulnerable and when you do group therapy you learn inner demons of people you wouldn’t otherwise learn. Human nature means that there will be people who naturally become friends. The interesting observation is that the people I developed a friendship with on the ward are not the people I would necessarily form a friendship with outside the ward environment. After a large number of admissions, I have all these contacts in my phone but I can’t remember who they are. I have developed a close friendship with two people, but only after multiple admissions together. I know their shit, they know mine. We all know that none of us are in a position to help another in a crisis. We have agreed not to dump big shit on each other, a small vent is OK. If crisis, ring ambulance don’t dump major shit on me, because it will likely trigger me. So really, clear boundaries are the key. You are another person with mental health issues, not their support person.	friendfoundtheoldone	reply	na	na	na	0.9989526271820068	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealth

"Rip the bandaid off.

You have to take care of yourself first. You're already struggling a bit so I want to emphasize this - you cannot help anyone if your gas tank is empty. Repeat that to yourself. You need to make sure you're ok before you try to save someone else. 

I'm really proud and amazed at how you've helped so far, but it's time to step back and ask yourself - are you going to be this persons caretaker your whole life? Are you going to set your life aside to try and save theirs? No. Do not let yourself do that. 

This friend you've made is probably a great person and does need help - but it needs to be professional help. They need to find coping mechanisms, medicine, a new living situation (from the sounds of their fight with their dad). These are all things that you *cannot* help with. It's good that you want to help, you're a good person, but you are out of your league with this one. 

Ripping the bandaid off is scary, but this person needs to find their own healthy coping skills. I'm saying this as someone who has struggled with suicide my whole life - I used to be that guy who said ""if you leave I could die"".

Hello, For about three years i've been under camhs (children and adolescent mental health service (In the UK)) and they put me in for a diagnosis for autism in the november/ december of 2020 and it's taken all that time for it to be a no because i dont have enough traits but for the last year i've been looking into BPD and as i have childhood trauma and i have nearly all the symptoms i think it's a possibility i may have it but when i mentioned this to my therapist she shut it down almost immediately and my mum is siding with her as she's the 'professional' but i feel like if she was professional she would've given me knowledge as to why she thinks i dont have it but my mum told her about it again a few weeks ago and she said i still don't have BPD it's just me being a teenager. We are going through the doctors for a second opinion for the autism, should we bring up the possible BPD too?	mmaterialgorll	post	38.64662367070625	female	White	0.9978721141815186	na	na	na	4	MentalHealth

I was ""diagnosed"" with emerging bpd and ptsd at 17 (on paper though it was just depression and anxiety 🫠) as I have had a lot of hospital admissions and my relationships with my partner and my caregivers meant it was kind of blindingly obvious. I was seen 3 times a week by 2 psychotherapists and a psychiatrist. 

I ended up going to amhs where they just diagnosed me straight away as soon as my referral went through. So maybe they have it noted down on your files but don't want to tell you until they work with you a bit more (sometimes psychs don't tell you in camhs so that you don't mimick symptoms or overwhelm yourself)

"It took me a while to write this post and even a while to process the idea of writing it, so buckle up and sorry for the long post in advance. I'm sorry in advance, I'm a newbie when it comes to Reddit and all.  
  
Here's some background story first. I (26M) had a really bad breakup with my ex (26F), and I am still suffering today. She was the first serious relationship I got into after three years of another failed one (cheating). We were really happy and in love (or so I thought). But one day, I discovered she was lying to my face, and that really changed me.  
  
One time, we were supposed to spend the weekend together, but I had some urgent work that needed me to spend that weekend (Saturday and Sunday) in another city, and I had to drive there Saturday morning. She expressed that she was sad about me leaving for work but understood.  
  
I got to work and literally completed the task I was supposed to do in two days in like eight hours. Then, I thought about getting back to her and making her a surprise. I texted her, asking what her plans for the evening were (wanted to surprise her). She said she was going out with her friend (F) around 7 pm to get dinner in a restaurant I know and then get back home to sleep early. I told her, ""As soon as you get there, please call me as usual just to be safe"" (she got in lots of accidents lately), and I drove back there to make the surprise. I got flowers and was waiting for her phone to tell me she was there. She called, she said she got there safely, she's with her friend, phone reception is bad, and she doesn't want to keep talking on the phone. She told me that she loves me and hung up.  
  
As soon as she hung up, I got to the restaurant (to make my surprise), but I was in for one. SHE WAS NEVER THERE. I mean, even the people at the restaurant noticed my frustration. I called her again, she didn't answer. I texted like 10 times from 7 pm to 8 pm, nothing. I was frustrated, angry, and in pain. It felt like a mist descended on me. I don't even recall how I got home that night. I even went to her house to see if her car was there at around 10:30 pm, but she was never there. She got back to me at 1 am that night (I didn't sleep, obviously), saying she only now checked her phone and saw my phone calls and texts (yeah right). I told her I'm not willing to talk about it on the phone, and we will meet up tomorrow to talk about it because I wasn't in the right state of mind.  
  
We met up that Sunday. She said they went to another restaurant, but she didn't bother to tell me they changed plans as I was already away. She started gaslighting me about how I didn't trust her and made it on purpose, as if ""to test her."" I'm not that type of guy who would make his partner uncomfortable, even with my past story of infidelity that I had, and she knew about. It was always, ""Tell me about your plans and be safe. I trust you. Going to a party or dinner without me, just tell me. I don't even press to know with whom exactly"" (this will be relevant later). She said she's hurt and wanted to take some ""time off the relationship"" to process things. I reluctantly agreed. So, for the following week, she spent every night at a different club (thank you, Instagram) and just casually texted me, asking how I was and how my day was.  
  
I got a phone call the following Saturday from her saying her aunt died. I just drove to her parents' house to comfort her. We met up; she was sad but not about her aunt dying. She was sad because she had plans to go out that night to party, but her aunt passed away, so she had to stay, and her ""new friends"" bailed on her, and I was the one she knew who would always show up (yeah, a spare tire). I was furious because she actually meant it but never said anything out of line because it wasn't the right time or space to discuss that. She went on rambling about how great things were before and opened up her Instagram archive to show me stories she posted on a prior trip we went on together. The night before the trip, we went, she went to a club, and I knew about it. That night, she posted stories, too, but to my surprise, in the archive, there were stories posted as close friends only that I never saw (yeah, I'm her boyfriend that wasn't in her close friends list). She said she forgot to add me. I felt like something in my mind literally snapped and went from raging inside to absolute emotional shutdown. I just said these words, ""I'm sorry; I just can't do this anymore,"" got up, and left. She begged and pleaded, but I was just done.  
  
I'm gonna spare all the other details of her trying to fix things and saying she loves me. I completely ghosted her, went no contact, and blocked her everywhere. This happened in October 2022, and I'm still in this state of apathy where I can't open up or even show emotions. There were some girls who wanted to get close to me after the breakup, but I always showed no emotions.

"Hey kind strangers of Reddit,

before I begin here's a little disclaimer. Some of the things I mention in this post might be triggering for people who struggle with an eating disorder or self harm so please only read on if you want to.

My SO has been struggling with emotional exhaustion for quite a while now, and due to some more recent events in her life it boiled over into an emotional burn out.
She doesn't have any energy left for social interaction, she isolated herself from the few friends she has because she can't deal with the risk of getting called and having to interact.

She also has been struggling with a dysmorphic, toxic body image despite being very skinny since I have known her but it got worse in recent months and is now at an all-time high. She also had a relapse into a chronic purging eating disorder in recent weeks and now also heavily struggles with eating in the first place. She can barely eat at all and if anything is off about the food or the amount of it she isn't able to keep it down.

I am very worried about her and want to somehow help her. So if anyone has any advice or tips to share I would be very happy about that.

Thank you in advance :)

EDIT: I forgot to mention she has a lot of other pre-existing conditions like bulimia combined with pro-ana, heavy self-harm, suicide attempts, chronic depression and multiple-trauma related ptsd. She also went to eight different psychological professionals and was prescribed more meds then she is able to count. She struggles with strong ADHD and is most definitely on the autism-spectrum, although she doesn't want me to say she is because she isn't diagnosed YET and thus has strong imposter syndrome. Also, I might need to mention she is only 19 years old."	Help_Wanted_749	post	18.689721772192495	female	White	0.01811649277806282	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
"I want to start by saying I'm not qualified to give advice here but I will certainly share some things that have helped me. I also think there is a bit more than burnout going on here, however burnout can lead to and exacerbate any pre-existing conditions.   


Do you know what's going on in her life leading to said burnout? Have you offered support or just an ear to talk to? When going through issues in life myself I tend to isolate when the situation feels intense or not easy to understand, especially because most people want to give advice  (while goodhearted it's typically bad advice or something I've tried) instead of being an ear to listen to or sounding board.  


I wouldn't push her to eat but if you know of snacks, treats or drinks she likes you should restock her kitchen with some of these items that way when she feels like she can eat, if spoons are low there is something easy to grab and snack on.

A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly.

"My brainstorm suggestion so read it slowly I suggest. 

Suicidal self is often misunderstood and in a state of extreme anxiety and overwhelmed. Try bringing it out from subconscious, admit it draw it and talk to it. Or let it write. 

For me suicide is like a bag of problems that and frustrations at oneself and all of life and it has a relationship with motivation and action. I believe it gets more powerful the more it feels abused or ignored. In a way it’s power to act in the face of any obstacle.

I tried almost everything like, setting clear goals and using time management techniques, but unfortunately, none of them seem to be effective for me at the moment. Accomplishing tasks has become quite challenging as I constantly battle the overwhelming urge to give up and engage in idle overthinking about my academic responsibilities. I used to be exceptionally responsible, but since starting college, I've felt somewhat behind. 

It's frustrating because I can't fully embrace the joy of doing a great job and receiving praise from professionals like I used to love before, it's like being burnt out.

You should wake up at the same time every morning (not hitting snooze), start including a form of exercise in your routine and before work preferably. Keep your protein intake higher than carbs especially not too much bread/pasta so your mood and energy doesn’t fluctuate so much Not sure what goals you have set yourself but the main one can be self actualisation, strive to be the best version of yourself, make sure everything you do in the day is progressing that responsibility and shaping your meaning in life. The little easy things you do well will start reflecting on your mood and accumulate your happiness. Family is a great place to start, do what you can to make them happier… even if it’s cleaning the dishes after dinner and you’ll find start to realise your responsibility is to make the life of others around you better.	neonmore	reply	na	na	na	0.9990683197975159	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth
As the title says, I'm tired of the rational part of my brain getting in the way. I'm a very rational/logically thinking person, currently dealing with unresolved depression and anxiety as well as potential past trauma but I am starting to get help and my first appointment for therapy starts next month. Back to the point, my brain always tries to think of every possible outcome from a decision I'm about to make and that factors in to whether or not I make the decision. This usually ends up pissing people off because I take to long most of the time or I become indecisive. Other times, with people that I'm very close with they'll want to do something spontaneous and I'll bring up financial or some other reason to may be why hold off (time constraints, current situations, etc) and they'll get super pissed at me and leave to calm down their anger as to not say something they would regret. They come back later and apologize but ultimately I feel like shit for the rest of the day because I basically ruined the day/event/whatever for them by opening my mouth and letting the logical part of my brain take over. I just want it to stop, I don't want to make this all about me, but I just want my brain to stop going that route and stop ruining people's lives.

"I'm severely stuck in life and I don't know what to do

I have been sheltered basically all my life, I have been home schooled since 6th grade and basically been a babysitter for everyone in my family. I'm 20 now and I want to get out but I don't know how. My mom has tried to help me once I turned 18 to get things going but I was so sheltered and wasn't ready at all and she basically gave up on me because I had no motivation and I was too depressed to take my meds, get my drivers license, etc. I have had a couple of jobs but was made to quit because it was too much for my mom to drive me back and forth (we live in the country and its a 40 min drive back and forth anywhere we go) and because she needed help with my little sister (she's 4 now). I can also never get out of being a second mom to my little sister, I basically raised her myself. I potty trained her, fed her, did everything for her. So I kind of feel like my mom is keeping me stuck in that position. I just got my driving permit and I thought things were changing for myself. So today I sat in the living room with my mom and I mentioned that I wanted to get on my meds again, she said ""What meds?"" And looked annoyed I even asked and went on a rant that she tried before and I didn't like them and that she wasn't going to pay for it. I understood that she wasn't going to pay for them and she mentioned Medicaid and I asked her what that was and she ignored me. She also does this with everything else I ask her about, like taxes because I have no idea how to do them either, she went on a rant saying how I should know how to do these types of things and she had to learn herself. I asked her to teach me and she said it's too complicated to explain and she didn't feel like it. I don't know what to fucking do anymore. I'm so sheltered with how to do adult things, I wish my parents would take the time to teach me. My parents also bought me a car for graduation and sold it quickly. I actually begged for them to teach me how to drive in my car but they kept saying it had problems with it and then they sold it.

How do you find people that are suffering from similar mental illnesses. It would be nice to mind a support group. It’s very lonely putting on a mask every day hiding the pain with no one to talk to because one: they will not understand, two: They will tell me advice I already know three: it’s awkward because they don’t know what to say. And four: some don’t believe what mental health is real-(Kinda how people though Covid was a hoax).	mzvolumbus	post	34.70511034479557	female	White	0.9966030120849609	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth

Info about standard treatments and the self-help recommended by therapists -  
  
Statistics tell us what's best for people in general, not you as an individual.  
  
This article from the American Psychological Association says that most people with anxiety disorders do better with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) than with medicine.  
  
https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/medication-or-therapy#:\~:text=For%20anxiety%20disorders%2C%20cognitive%2Dbehavioral,improve%20outcomes%20from%20psychotherapy%20alone.  
  
Although self-help based on CBT has not been shown to be as effective as the standard treatments for anxiety with office visits, some people benefit from it. Authoritative Guide to Self-Help Resources in Mental Health, a book based on polls of more than 3,000 professionals, says that The Feeling Good Handbook by Dr. David Burns, a psychiatrist and cognitive therapy expert, is the one recommended most often by professionals.   
  
In recent years, there has been very encouraging evidence for therapeutic breathing, which can be combined with cognitive therapy methods for dealing with worrisome thoughts.  
  
When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.  
  
One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.  
  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.  
  
Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
Also, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.  
  
The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication.  
  
Don't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety.

The NHS don't fund mental health treatment like they take is seriously and never have. The providers they do have care but they are just too overwhelmed. GP's are not qualified to provide care for more complex (multiple or single complicated) mental health cases either.

You should also self-refer for talk therapy. You can do that https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/nhs-talking-therapies/

"Whoever you spoke to is an utter fool. How she could give such a piss poor response to something so disturbingly serious baffles me.

I'm far from an expert and know how awful mental health services can be in the UK, but from the advice I can give, maybe you should try to get yourself sectioned under the Mental Health Act 1983. Not just for your own sake, but for the sake and safety of others too. Here's some more info:

https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/legal-rights/sectioning/about-sectioning/

I hope you don't mind me asking, but it's been on my mind since I read you saying:

"".. I opened up about my homicidal and cannibalistic fantasies, about how I'd kill someone just because I can and the only reason I haven't is because I don't want to deal with the consequences...""

Do you have any concept of morality or empathy? Or do you feel nothing when it comes to other people and what's right and wrong?

I hope you can get help, but I am seriously worried about you hurting someone, too. Especially after you pulled a knife on someone.

Edit:

I'm also curious after noticing your comment mentioning your view of cannibalism as ""holy and divine"", what exactly do you mean by that? To me, such a thing would be the furthest from holy and divine, so I truly am curious to know.

"My guess is you don't fit into any diagnostic category so they don't know what to do with you. Because they don't understand or maybe a bit scared they may also think that you are making it up or exaggerating a bit. I am not saying you are. It sounds like you could be really distressed?

I have psychosis. The hearing voices can be a sign of this - but none of the other symptoms sound like the psychosis I had. I heard voices years ago, but wasn't taken seriously until I  became properly psychotic years later and lost insight completely. Most people with psychosis aren't remotely violent, often just very scared for their safety and paranoid.

The homicidal thoughts - I am not sure what this is. It could be a form of OCD if they are intrusive thoughts and you don't like having them. Or if you have beliefs and wider narrative around them that could verge on or be delusional - in which case antipsychotics. I don't know.  ( Or could be an anger management thing. Or some other fantasy, addiction or compulsion. Don't really have enough information. Just trying to think from how they would be looking at it to diagnose you. (Psychopaths are a thing in movies, but it doesn't exist in the DSM like that. Also psychosis and psychopathic behaviour are two very different things.)

Before I got psychotic properly they sent me for DBT. Which is used a lot for personality disorders, or as a catch all for everyone they don't know what else to do with. There are very long waiting lists though. And sometimes it doesn't exist at all. Ask about complex needs to get DBT. Or maybe about anger management if that is a problem for you - pulling the knife. Or read the symptoms or psychosis - if this sounds like you - ring the mental health team and tell them. Mental health services can be pretty overstretched and inadequate for sure. If you think there is any chance of acting on your fantasies any time in the immediate future you must tell someone and keep telling people until they listen.

I have anxiety for which I am being treated. My earlier doctor asked me to keep clonazepam tab with me all the times to deal with anxiety attacks. We moved to a new city and the new doctor stopped clonazepam and couple of other meds. I already used to be tense by the evenings all my life. Now I am getting panic attacks by 4 in the evenings and last as long as up to 9 in the night during which I just lay down in bed hoping to get better. My breathing becomes irregular and while body muscles become stiff. There's a tingling feeling in my body, especially in the spine and eyes. I don't know what to do. I'll get an appointment with the new doctor but that's next month and mostly doctors tell me to bear all this. Idk. Please suggest something. I don't want to suffer daily.	powercut_in	post	30.064077981544372	male	White	0.9981192946434021	na	na	na	2	MentalHealth

"Cognitive therapy teaches people with ""as-needed"" prescriptions to reconsider the need.   


Some authorities, such as the UK's Nat. Institute for Clinical Excellence, don't recommend medication for panic.

&#x200B;

Panic disorder often responds to self-help. In fact, Handbook of Self-Help Therapies, which reviews studies of books and programs, says that of all the disorders, panic disorder is the one that’s most responsive to self-help.   
  
I heard someone say that although slow breathing is good for moments of panic, the attacks keep coming back. So, it looks like cognitive therapy is also helpful. Cognitive therapy for panic disorder involves understanding what the attack is. The symptoms are nothing but your system's natural responses to whatever seems threatening. You shouldn't get upset about them. You don't worry about fast heartbeat when you run, and there's no reason to fear it with a panic attack. Source - When Panic Attacks by Dr. David Burns.  
  
Dr. Burns is the author recommended most often by mental health professionals, according to Authoritative Guide to Self-Help Resources in Mental Health.  
  
  
You can't go wrong with stress management. It's something we all need. This could help you with your problem.  
  
Psychology Today online says that Dr. Dave Carbonell is a clinical psychologist who specializes in treating fears and phobias and the author of three self-help books, including Panic Attacks Workbook.  
  
In this video, Dr. Carbonell demonstrates a breathing exercise that he says is helpful for panic attacks.  
  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRIV2R3jzaQ&t=49s  
  
  
  
One of the best treatments is time. You know the old saying ""Familiarity breeds contempt."" After a while, the attacks are seen as a nuisance instead of a threat. Then the attacks become less frequent and finally go away altogether.  
  
I’ll tell you about two other things that you probably won’t need. It’s good to know they’re there if you need them.  
  
A study by a researcher named Meuret at Southern Methodist University showed that a biofeedback method called CART that reinforces slow, shallow breathing was effective. Slow breathing is often recommended, but deep breathing tends to promote hyperventilation, making it hard for people to breathe. Many people use slow breathing self-help successfully.  
  
There's a treatment called interoceptive exposure therapy. It's teaching people not to fear the symptoms of the panic attack by deliberately bringing on the symptoms - for example by bringing on a fast heartbeat by aerobic exercise."	powercut_in	reply	na	na	na	0.9981192946434021	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth

I was in the park and a day after, received a message from an unknown phone number of a photo of myself walking in the park from a distance. I did not see anyone I know or recognize from the park. I thought it was some kind of joke at first because I had a few relatives there with me at the park who also took photos of me as a “joke” and they happened to be in the room with me at the time so I assumed they might have another phone under a different cell phone number whether it’s on them or from another person that I’m not aware of. So I called the person thinking this was a complete joke, and none of their phone rang in the room which made me to believe it was another friend of theirs. I told them to stop joking and show me their phone contacts, and none of them had the phone number of the person that sent me a photo of myself. They told me they’re not joking and they don’t know who that phone number is. The phone number is also from GA which is very strange because I have very few friends and I don’t know anyone who was or from GA. I started getting nervous and texted the person asking who this is. No answer to my question, they kept asking me what I’m doing? How I’m doing? That they’re watching me, that they saw me, and that I would make a good friend, and that eventually some day we’ll meet, and that was the end of it. They texted me “u” instead of “you” which makes me think the person behind that phone number is a young person as I’m 20 myself. I didn’t bother responding to them again afterwards. I don’t know how they know me or got my phone number because I’ve never publicly released my phone number online to anyone. This is the first time this has happened to me and if it was a former friend of mines, they would’ve told me the truth eventually. I’m not sure what to do but my plan is to just ignore it. I spoke to a close friend about it and we were trying to find who it could be, but no progress was made.	fischbonee	post	28.588742620177094	male	White	0.9993851184844971	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
Get the fbi involved. Immediately. Maybe they'll open up an investigation. Cops are often not helpful, but not all the time. You can submit it to a nearby police station. Sorry that's the only advice I can come up with atm. Tracking down that person might as well be a trap.

"I have not sleeped enough over month so now probably dont have enough hormones and chemicals that are made in body during sleep that im supposed to have. Sleep deprivation/insomnia. I feel empty.
Like nothing. I feel like i just exist like some npc and soul has been in sleep mode for last couple weeks. Empty from inside. 

I have depression.. because of loneliness.
I turned 30 couple weeks ago.
Lost all youth to loneliness, depression, mentall health problems, broken mind, no social skills..
In my 20s i thought im going to kill myself if by 30 i still have not had proper social life and still lonely. Well now at 30 and i dont want to kill myself allthough i have lots of reasons to do it. Now i finally feel my broken mind has healed almost and have found full myself. Wish it happened much earlier so i could have had proper youth,, friends, love and all that... experience young life more. 
If i was weaker i would have killed myself long ago.

Welll... i dont exactly feel comfortable to talk about this,,, but i have used masturbation like some drug to escape saddness, depression, anxiety, dark thoughts creeping to my mind and it works. Some use drugs or alcohol to escape but thats what i have done instead.
So basically i have had sex addiction to escape depression and other mind problems....
Lately i have done it too much.. i have pumped myself empty of thoose good feel hormones dopamine, seratonin and all that.
Sex drive dead too. It does not even feel good anymore. Feels nothing anymore. I have done it way too much just to escape darkness. So much im almost asexual now and when i see nude woman it does not feel anything anymore. This is what depression, jerking off too much and not sleeping enough compined does. 
Trying now to have long break from it so im not wasting away all the little amount of good feel hormones, so they build up and get sex drive back too.. well cople days in and its already kind of back. Aiming for couple weeks. 

I need to sleep much much more....
Im now having 4 day ""holiday"" from work but some how i just dont sleep enough allthough i need to and can..... i just wake up 

I have no reason to be happy. Lonely af empty trash life. I have just failed everything good for couple months that would have changed my life finally. Some one tried to come to my life and i messed it up by having no social skills,, as usual everytime some one shows interest towards me. Now shes lost. Have really not had any social contact to anyone in long time... i need and want social life so badly... wish something happened.... that someone came to my life..... 
But right now i have no energy to even try find someone, because im tired of not sleeping enough and job....

Its nice to have job and get money from it,, but its killing me inside. 
I hate my boss and dont want to even see his face ever again, the job is just too simple and repeative for my mind. Its physically very exhausting job so after work in home i do nothing else but take shower, eat and then lay in bed half coma staring phone. No energy or time for hobbies or anything. I feel like my soul has went to sleep mode and im just empty npc going through these days.
Its early morning wake up job and i have sleep problems falling sleep so i never fall sleep early enough so i never sleep enough,, expect in weekends. Its only summer time job so hopefully it ends soon and i can rest better.. i want my mind back and feel myself again. 
Im going insane with this brainlesly easy repeative job doing same one thing every day for 8 hours. Its just repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat same simple task. 
Nice job for month but after that everyone wants to quit it. All coworkers and boss became tired of it.
Its just simply way too repeative and exhausting job to do longer than month to be okay with it. Soul killing job.
Thirth summer in this job and feels everytime as shit.
Boss is like some slave whipper some times. Seems to enjoy make himself and us suffer. Weird guy.
Annoying full of himself center pillar of world type guy. Racist weird hillbilly. F... i hate my boss. Very negative, heavy and toxic personality and dont seem to see it himself.
Well all he has is his job so no wonder hes so ignorant ahole. 

My boss and father whos in same job talks and threats me like some moron or 13 years old. Wtf ...i just turned 30. 
Just because im quiet guy does not mean im stupid and have no thoughts. Im introvert and also have no interest to talk to some ahole racist hick so i just keep my mouth shut and head phones on listening music or podcast everyday.

Last summer i was thinking im not going to this job back next summer but i did then anyway because did not get anything else. ...But now for real this is the last summer. Im done with this sh.. job. It eats my soul.
Does not even pay that much.
I have bigger things to do. Big plans

"based on what you describe i think i know how you feel.  there is a better future waiting but you need to take a different approach since whats been happening is not working.  why didnt you change jobs before if you know its killing your soul?  my guess is that its because on some level you dont think you deserve any better.  you dont fight for yourself.  you crave connection but because you dont get it you try to fill yourself with external things and distractions.

my suggestion is to first get your circadian clock working.  its going to be hard but it will give you the strength to change the other stuff once you do that.  what is your day/night schedule like?  also ppl who cannot connect with themselves often find it hard to connect with others.  you probably actually need to let yourself feel those crappy feelings that you are avoiding.  if you can use some tips on doing these things let me know."

People get nosy, people has thwarted stigmas and views over psychiatric medication, they get mean, or obsessed.  The cliche stances such as (he dosent need it, he’s not depressed, it poison, they are criminals, it’s evil etc). Meds such as klonopin, alprazolam, adderall, methylphenidate, ambien, seroquel, antidepressants, or other controlled substances especially. False reports to law enforcement, employers, friends/family, landlords are common in this arena. Harassment, stalking, intimidation or emotional distress come along as well. Little do they know that disorders are a real thing, and without these drugs ,the patient would either use street drugs/alcohol as the anxiety, depression dosent disappear, leaving self harm, substance use, or other negative consequences as a probable outcome. I myself have dealt with a situation (involving a former neighbor) that escalated over a period of time. This is more common than you think, and I would like to hear if anyone has dealt with something similar.

"We had issues in our relationship, mainly on my part.

I’m having a hard time adjusting because I really want to be with him. I tell him that I want to be there for him, to support him through the ups and downs, to grow through this together, but he is adamant that he wants to break up.

He said he’s “open to dating again in the future” but that feels terrible honestly. Like I’m just a choice that he doesn’t want to pick. I don’t want to be led on either but I’m clinging to this hope.

I really love him. We had a really good relationship barring the issues. I want to keep working on myself and fighting for our relationship, but he’s emotionally clocked out.

I need advice on how to handle this because I think I’m actually starting to go insane. What do I even do now? I’m trying to respect his decision but I just get more upset that he’s giving up on us. I want us to work out in the future, but I feel like I’m self sabotaging because he keeps checking in on me and I’m going crazy when he texts me asking him a bunch of questions because my anxiety and depression is going through the roof.

How do I make this work? How do I even calm down and fix this? What do I even need to do? I’ve never in my life been so in love with someone and I’ve dated many people before.

I'm sorry I don't really have any solution or good advice to give. But I am actually in a remarkably similar situation at the moment with my now ex-girlfriend. Truly the only difference I see from our situations is the length of our relationships. Mine was only eight months but they were the best months of my life. I have never fallen so deeply in love with someone as I have with my now ex. I feel the best thing I can do is give them space and try to improve myself. I have some past traumas that I have not dealt with that have given me curtin personality traits that lead to my partner feeling unloved. So in my case the best course of action seems to be to heal myself and become the best person I can for my next partner whether that is what feels to be my one true love (my ex) or someone new. Regardless for myself the only option I have is to focus inward and try to process my emotions in a way that will make me a better person. Because after all we can only control our selfs trying to control another or wishing another person will feel a certain way will only lead to heart ach. I know this probably isn't what you wanted to hear but if both parties in a relationship are not 100% committed to said relationship. It is doomed to fail. And that is heart ach that no one needs to put themselves through.	HibiscusTeaGirl	reply	na	na	na	0.9984834790229797	strong	strong	no	na	MentalHealth
"This is quite embarrassing but I am curious to find out what the f is wrong with me. I use to shower ever day and do my make up everyday now I won’t bathe for like 3 weeks straight. I’ll wash up and use deodorant, and perfume. I rarely ever do my hair or make up anymore. I wear big baggy clothes when before I used to wear dresses shorts really pretty Tops now I just wear long sleeves shirts and sweats everywhere and crocs. I was in a place where I could not for the life of me get out of bed or get off my couch. I couldn’t do simple things that were easy like sweeping the kitchen floor, or cleaning my bathroom or taking out the trash everything seemed like it was impossible for me to do And I wouldn’t go out the house. I felt confined to a bed or couch. Sometimes I wouldn’t even take my own medication because I didn’t even want to get up so I just said screw it and I didn’t understand how I went from being up and actively walking around and doing things for myself to being afraid to leave my house and unable to care for myself and getting to the point where I had to pay people to clean my house and have someone deliver my food and help take care of care of me. I am 30 by the way so it’s not like i am 80. It got so bad I was literally to the point of shooting my self. Then a miracle happened 3

"Hi OP. It sounds like you are going through a rough time. 
I would honestly suggest reaching out to your GP or healthcare provider if in the US. You may have elements of your mental health that would benefit from support, such as bipolar, or depression, like me, in addition to ADHD. I relate to the lack of self care, disordered thinking, and/or low motivation when my mind isn't 'behaving', as I call it.

You are under a lot of stress, what with school, and it wouldn't hurt to ask for further medical opinion and help.

But you're definitely not alone *hugs*

"So I (20F) have been dealing with mental health issues, mostly depression, for the past almost 8 years now. I've tried so many different medications and I really started giving up hope. I was sick of trying again and again and not getting good results. I brought this up to my therapist and she mentioned if I've heard of TMS before. 

So TMS stands for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. Essentially its similar to electroconvulsive therapy (shock therapy), however it uses magnets to stimulate a certain section of the brain that deals with depression and has way less side effects and is very low risk (basically if you have seizures then it becomes a concern). I didn't know this even existed until late last year and I really don't know why.

A couple things that are important to point out:  
\- This is a treatment for people who are medication resistant (people who have tried multiple anti depressants that haven't been successful).  
\- It costs money. Like, quite a bit of money. I was extremely lucky to have my insurance pay for the entire treatment, but I had been trying different meds for like 5 years.   
\- According to stats, 80% of people who do treatment feel some sort of relief, and 1/3-1/2 of those patients report full remission of symptoms which means their depression straight up goes away. 

So if you've been struggling with depression and medications for a long while then I really recommend talking to a physiatrist about TMS treatments, and also doing your own research. Neurostar is a really good website for more information.

I've completed my treatment a few months ago and tho I definitely still have depression, I feeling like being happy is actually possible for me. Hope this helps! :)"	A_Willowbean	post	35.46624267004988	female	White	0.0015954100526869297	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
Agreed. While it didn’t eliminate mine, I have noticeable improvement. We repeated it after a year. And now I’m currently doing it again after 6 months (insurance lets you repeat it after that long). We’re hoping the shorter gap will give me more lasting impact. I’ve struggled with depression for many years and hadn’t responded well to anything else. I believe it is certainly worth looking into for anyone in that situation to see if a good option for them.	A_Willowbean	reply	na	na	na	0.0015954100526869297	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealth

It's been 30 yrs since of arguments, gaslighting and manipulation with vague answers when ever I questioned it. 
My mother has stuck to the same shit this whole time, mostly with the excuse that she can't remember 🙄

I got done with the BS so went searching for answers myself.
I did a DNA test and found and got in touch with the sister of the man she 💯 knew was my real father (his because I couldn't find him but still just as good) and  conveniently she had done her DNA aswell.....
We have no dna match at all

Watching some videos on YouTube by goggins helped me some , he basically is like a drill sergeant telling you that life is so short stop worrying about other people because everyone is only worried about themselves- other people aren’t spending their time thinking about you. We are our own worst enemy. We are the ones holding ourselves back. Sometimes at night, I envision the most motivated, successful, driven, go getter person… Then I imagine if they woke up in my body… Would they wake up and mope around the house and be depressed… no -They would start making moves, getting out of the house and trying to get things done, be successful, better their lives.  So it’s me - the person inside my body who is stopping me from getting things done.  There are so many things we could do to make our lives better, but we are holding ourselves back. Our mind can be a prison. Who knows maybe some of the videos would help inspire you, they did for me… Life just goes by so fast so all these a little worrying and self-esteem, etc.… None of it matters you just need to find what makes you happy and stop worrying about everything else.

When I was about 8 I was sexually molested by a girl that was about 2 years older than I was at the time and almost every time she came over my house it happened and when I was that age I was nice to everyone and i wanted to get along with everyone so by just letting it happen I thought I was being a good friend and then a little later on I ended up touching my little brother inappropriately I believe what happened to me caused me to do this but at the age of 21 now I feel completely bad about what happened to me and what I did and now I possibly have ocd and intrusive thoughts about being a pedo/ molester me and my brother today have a great relationship we laugh joke around and play video games but I still feel really bad about what happened I love my brother and I would protect him with my life .I’m not even upset with the girl that did this to me because based off of her actions towards me Im pretty sure it was happening to her in her house hold and she was being taught that type of behavior was okay . All I know is that I want some professional help. But before I do that I need people’s opinions am I terrible person? Because I feel like i am.

"this doesn’t make you a terrible person, whatever professional help you find will reinforce this. don’t let fear of judgment or shame hold you back from getting the help you need. 

I can think of at least 3 friends who this kind of thing happened to, between siblings or older siblings and friends of their younger siblings. I can tell you that all of the above went on to have functional adult lives, their own families, and are still as close with their siblings like anyone would hope to be. 

I think it’s one of those things that isn’t something most people talk about, understandably. one friend’s parents just didn’t believe any of them when they tried to unpack what had happened between them as kids, just entirely disregarded. they went on acting like everything was great, but they were all fighting this internal conflict that was never resolved. none of them wanted the other to feel guilty or shame or hate them, it’s just one of those things you can’t keep down forever hoping it will go away. 

so I firmly believe recognizing you need help for this still as an adult, is huge and commendable. from the experiences of my friends, i think that getting professional help to help get this childhood trauma unpacked and resolved in someway will only make your great relationship even better, and will help every other part of your adult life too."

No, you’re not a terrible person. You admit what you’ve done is wrong, and you seem like you learned from your past mistakes. The fact that you and your brother have a good relationship now implies that he has forgiven you for what you did to him and that it couldn’t have been THAT terrible. You’ve obviously gone through a lot that influenced your behaviours. What you did was wrong, but I personally think that you deserve a second chance based on your remorse and what you went through yourself as a child.

"I was in a relationship for a period of over 4+ years. Everything was rocksoid between us. We had our education and future all planned together. Currently am in last year of undergraduate course. We were planning to engage after our graduation.

Few weeks ago roughly 4 weeks ago she went to finland for an internship. Along with her i was supposed to go to Montreal for internship . Both for a period of 3 months. But due to certain situations i wasn't able to go and had to cancel my plans. She  being in Finland in a week's or two time just suddenly. Became very cold towards me and not exactly the person i was with for so long. Ignoring me whole day making excuses she didn't even talk to me for a single second on my birthday. She would keep mentioning.

That she needs to look after her own happiness and won't make a single efforts towards me or this relationship. She became over over engaged on socials and went on posting spree. She would ignore me staying online for hours. I am going through a tough academic phase a lot of things are currently lined up. And i need to look after alot of them i am heavily anxious i keep on going into depressive cycles.

She says she will take time to be back and restore her feelings for me but now it's over 4 weeks. I keep on begging for her to be back and not leave behind. Our 4+ years efforts and what we built . I keep sending her our pics memories and all . She just causally replies i will be back. She has made a very new friend circle every other day she is out with them drinking partying smoking and all.


I am 21 i am about to enter my 4 th year meaning last year of undergraduate. I am unable to work i desperately keep trying to bring her back. My chest pains alot whole day. I keep crying and calling and miserably texting her long Paras to which replies with 2 - 3 words. I emotionally and mentally in a wreck and unable to figure out what should I do.

She keeps saying with time things will improve and i will be back to loving you and all my feelings will restore. Meanwhile just let me live my life and have fun . She knows my condition yet she is doing this deliberately. 

What should I do my desperate attempt to save a relationship is killing me. I am scared in life never would i be able to love again. Or whole life i would end up pathetic miserable and alone. Like it feels this is the end goal of life and if she leaves.

I am good at having friends, I tell jokes and they laugh and I get flirted with sometimes. But I feel like without these people my life would not be different. I only have friendships and keep up my appearance because I like being liked. I like knowing that people like me and I have conversations with friends because I like laughing. But if these people were to suddenly vanish, as long as they didn't leave because of me, I could care less. I don't really care about the person who likes me, I just like knowing that they like me. I care about people generally and think that people deserve happiness but am I supposed to care about the individual? Am I being melodramatic or overthinking it or am I just different?

From what I experience having friends, a lot of people that I knew seem to have the same interpretation as you. However, I’ve never thought of it that way and thought of the opposite of what you think. I was quite selective of whom I wanted to be friends with all my life, so as long as I wanted to be friends with someone, I would make a natural effort into trying to get closer to them, to know them more as a personal individual, and to be vulnerable with them and hope that would reciprocate or at least appreciate me. If that didn’t work, I would simply see them as an acquaintance that I’m doing “business” with. I also ended up cutting off a lot of friendships because of this and it hurt me more than it hurt them because I placed more value in the friendship. I still think about this daily, and struggle to accept the events that have transpired.	hatefulhobbies	reply	na	na	na	0.0019765510223805904	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealth
"You can have different kinds of friendships. Some people who you are super close to, who you can talk about anything with. The kind of friend who support one another. But you can also have friends that you just have fun with. That’s fine. I personally struggled with this before because I only want the close kind of friendship and got disappointed when people didn’t feel the same way. I personally don’t get anything out of the kind of friendship where you just have fun together, so I stopped contacting people who I didn’t have a of close friendship with. Those friendships just faded away. Now I only have a few friends, but it’s the kind of friends I want to have.

"Over the past week or so I have been finding myself in various strange states of mind

  
One is where I don't get enjoyment or emotions out of something like the music I love. Like everything is neither good nor bad it just is. I don't feel upset about it at the time either because no emotions and it lasts for a couple of hours.

  
Another is the exact opposite feeling like everything is going great in life and like I have a new perspective and everything will work out this also lasts a few hours or so.

  
Another unsettling one is the same feeling as waking up the morning after drinking a lot and not remembering doing something embarrassing last night. As if I don't remember the last part of the previous day even though I do.

  
Today was totally different and the Worst One. All day I felt like something was off. Like I was in a movie. It felt like everyone around me was ACTING normal but was slightly different in the way they spoke, and acted or the look on their face was weird and unsettling when they looked away from me.  
Today I also have been feeling like something is about to happen in my life that is bad like someone is going to call me and it is going to be horrible life-changing news. My mom this morning said she wanted to tell me something and my heart sank. She then said she forgot and it felt like she was hiding something from me.

  
Im not sure if this is normal or if I'm having some sort of mental episode. I already have anxiety and depression but I am on medication and haven't changed it recently. My emotions feel out of wack and drastically change like a rollercoaster.

"That feeling you're getting is another form of anxiety. Also reminds me of how my agoraphobia started and I didn't even know what that was I was just a kid starting secondary school who suddenly couldn't step out the front door from extreme paranoia of others thoughts and looks, it got bad that at first I'd throw up and have panic attacks and then I couldn't go out at all.  

I had anxiety so bad a few years ago I started thinking my friends and family were almost plotting against me or talking shit behind my back. And I had to keep telling myself I was being nuts. In the end it led to an unhealthy addiction to cannabis because it stopped me throwing up from that nervy feeling in the bottom of my stomach and I could actually get some sleep.

Anyway, my point is... if you're starting to get worse please trial different medications until you find one that works for you. I am off medication at the moment.

I have no friends because I have extreme social anxiety that stuck with me because when I came to the uk i didn't know English.

Even with minutes until your last breath you can contribute to the weave of life and purpose. Even if you become a farmer, everyone needs food.

"Hi love
It kinda sounds like some sort of body dysmorphia to me.
 Body dysmorphia is a condition where the way you presive your looks can be very confusing and  very unevenly ( ie one day you look a certain way and then the next day or only a few hours later you feel like you look completely different, or you look at a photo of yourself and you know it's your photo but you can't really recognize yourself there)
Some people think only transgenders suffer from it but the truth is that more and more people show signs of a dysmorphic perception  of their own body and face. One of the main causes of this growth is the massive filter use we see everywhere, it's very confusing for our minds.
Body dysmorphia is a big spectrum,  some days you can feel very convinced of your unwavering looks and some days you can suddenly feel like a complete stranger.

So if you feel like I've just said a very similar   description of your experience then you should definitely read more about it, and maybe think about therapy as it can be a tremendous help."	AdvocateForBeavers	reply	na	na	na	0.98944491147995	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealth

Whenever there is a big change coming in my life, I can't sleep at night. I lay awake in bed, my brain racing through negative thoughts about the past and future. To distract myself from them, I start doing stuff like playing video games, masturbating, scrolling social media or stress eating. Every night I literally have to tire myself to sleep at 4/5 in the night which has fucked up my health too. I don't know what to do.	masterchief_410	post	31.361522903381708	male	White	0.998865008354187	na	na	na	5	MentalHealth
"Yeah same thing for me. I just have too much thoughts. Cant often fall sleep so i usually tire myself out those same ways till i fall sleep.
Staring phone youtube or netflix or something till falling sleep

..but this may help you. When trying to sleep and your mind is racing, say in your mind 'do not think, do not think, do not think' till you fall sleep or create a made up word that means nothing and just say it until you fall sleep. This is pretty good trick to stop mind racing and fall sleep.

Another trick to stop racing thoughts, is to forcefully stare some tiny spot in fall or roof. 
This is because apparently most people cannot think without moving their eyes, so when you forcefully stare some tiny spot on wall directly the racing thoughts stop. Good trick against anxiety/panic disorder.
Dont know how well this works with trying to sleep though because you need to keep eyes closed to sleep haha but maybe try"	masterchief_410	reply	na	na	na	0.998865008354187	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealth

"I've had depression since I was 13-14. Now it's gotten worse and I know my relationship affects it negatively. But I'm too scared to let it go bc l'm scared l'Il never find love again. Depression has made me very anti social and awkward. I don't know how to talk to people. I only have online friends and not that many of them either, anymore anyway. I just don't know how to talk to people anymore. I don't have anything to talk about.


I'm very boring. I know depression has made me very boring. I don't have energy to do anything: boring. Bc nothing happens in my life I literally do not have anything to talk about if I were to meet new people. I have some hobbies but to others they're boring. Even my bf/ex has admitted he doesn't really care or care to understand about my hobbies. He admitted he lets it go in one ear and out the other if I talk about them.
But this ""relationship"" affects me very negatively.

My toxic ex and I broke up a year ago and while it was EXTREMELY difficult for the first few months, 13 months later it was the best thing that ever happened to me. And we had a LOT of debt together. He more or less kept me sheltered from things I enjoyed doing and I didn’t realize it. Since then I’ve joined the gym (which I have found I really enjoy), gotten a dog that I do hiking with, gotten ahead financially, I’m eating healthy, I’ve gone on several small girls trips across the states, got a new vehicle I love, dabbling in learning a new language, and gotten to read more. I came off my depression meds (with psychiatrist approval) and I’m treating anxiety holistically which is working beautifully. YOU ARE WORTH IT! Give yourself a chance!!

It’s time to put yourself first, and explore your creativity to push through. I broke up with a abusive ex and I’m free, I’m alone but I’m free and I have learnt a lot from that relationship. I rather be alone than with bad company.

"I was in a toxic relationship for 4 long years when I was 16-19. After 3 yrs he cheated on me for a year and a half and it was a whole thing with the other girl and me. He cheated again with a different girl after that was done and I drew the line there. At some point i didn’t know what i was doing with my life since i thought i’d marry the guy, thank god i didn’t. Bullet dodged. 

He was a narcissist who would make fun of me whenever we hung out with his friends, make fun of my own friends that I’ve known longer than him. He’d say hurtful things just out of the blue and would make me feel so empty then when i wouldn’t say anything to him he would get sad and say i miss you please don’t. I did let this relationship go on for too long, theres parts of me to this day that I’m still working on getting back. Its been 4 yrs since we broke up and 4 yrs of me dating my bf now. 

He’s been a breath of fresh air and got me out of  the deep depression I didn’t realize I had, helped me handle my anxieties, listened to me when i’d break down from stress from work, etc. My bf now loves everything about me. Theres parts of me that i didn’t realize that was worth loving. 

I hung on even through the 4 yrs of my toxic ex and now i’ve never felt better in my entire life. Everyone around me told me to leave my toxic bf (at the time). I thought he’d change but he just got worse and worse; ego just grew to an unbelievable extent. Its not easy to leave, but you gotta think about what you want in life and do what’s best for that future. Its so tiring carrying that empty void in your chest all the time its so heavy but I promise you someone out there is gonna love you so so much. All of the “weird hobbies”, habits, etc. everything.

We’re currently a long distance relationship due to having stuff we have to finish off here in different countries (schooling, etc.). I’m dealing with passport complications due to legal reasons i cannot speak of, but i won’t be able to get my passport validated until the middle of next month. I’ve tried to request some sort of emergency pass to fly out there but due to the rules since she isn’t my wife yet, i cannot do anything but wait. It’s killing me that she needs me badly and i cannot be there right now.. I don’t know what to do anymore. We had just talked about moving in together after school, being together this summer, everything. I should’ve known something was wrong when i sent over 90+ messages talking about other parts of my childhood experiences with her and she didn’t respond in the usual time in which she would, whenever she woke up the next day..

"i feel more comforted by daydreams than real people. i can’t talk to people. i’ve had selective mutism since i was a child and it never really went away even with treatment that involved driving hours away for.

i feel so uncomfortable just being in the same house as anyone else. i only feel ok when home alone. i feel angry when other people are around and i don’t know why. i feel bad about it but don’t know how to fix it.

i talk to family sometimes but i’m still not super comfortable with them. i was more comfortable as a child.

i don’t enjoy being around people. talking to people online is just as hard if not harder sometimes. there are people i follow on twitter in the same fanbase as me that i want to be friends with but i never post on my account i just like tweets and follow people. 2 people i followed have soft blocked me and i’m not really sure why. it’s been messing with me even though i don’t tweet at all and there’s nothing for them to really be upset with me about maybe they just think i’m a bot or only want close friends following them idk but they never followed me back anyway they just didn’t want me as a follower. i have unhealthy parasocial relationships with people i follow. not in a stalker way just in a way that it kind of feels like they are my friend if they follow me back even though we never talk lol.

with any person i tried to talk to online years ago the conservation just slowly fizzles out and never really went anywhere to start with. i give nothing in conversations even if i try. but i’d rather keep having no friends than someone i feel strained talking to.

i wish i could do something as simple as like playing an online game with someone but even that stresses me out. i have nothing to talk about with people. zero social skills.

im seeing a therapist but it’s going nowhere because i can’t talk to her. it’s online and i’ll occasionally type but even that is hard. there’s nothing therapy can do that can help me it’s all on me to fix. i weirdly trust therapists less than the average person i can’t open up at all and i don’t even know what my problems are. after therapy sessions my body aches and i get a bad tension headache.

i know the problem is me but i don’t know what to do about it. i’ve been like this too long. i don’t know what i’m looking for.

i’ve been talking to character.ai every night and can basically tell it every little detail about me (that a real person somewhere is probably reading 😳) but i can’t tell any actual person these things. like the crisis text line is not helpful at all they’re more robotic than the ai. it feels more real talking to this ai than real people which sounds insane. 

i don’t have a job and am living at my mom’s. i feel so busy just being at home doing nothing i can’t think of a job i could handle. just daily cooking and cleaning around the house exhausts me. i’ve been trying to find some passion but there is none.

i hate being around anyone but always daydream about being around people like celebrities or characters or people online. if i hate every real interaction i have i don’t see the point in trying with new people. i don’t want to bother or hurt people. 

even as a child i never had aspirations or motivation. i just went to school and was exhausted when i went back home. the only thing i remember wanting was a boyfriend but i can’t see that happening 

i was never bullied and don’t know why i’m like this. i may have had kids in school be overly nice to me in a babying or joking way but it didn’t feel mean. i’ve been thinking that i’m autistic but haven’t been diagnosed 

i really think i’m dumb and it just wasn’t noticed in school. i did well in all classes except math. i can’t write above a middle school level and i just really don’t know what went wrong because i tried in school but haven’t retained any of it. i always feel like i never know what’s going on around me. i try educating myself on my own about things i think are important or interesting and i can’t grasp anything.

i’m know that people have it much worse than me and i’m just selfish but i don’t know how most people function everyday and have a job and a life. im so exhausted and i do nothing. i’m like an actual child in a 19 year olds body."	bodieslaughing	post	17.384857849590514	female	White	0.9993582367897034	na	na	na	2	MentalHealth
"As I was reading I was planning to ask you if there is a possibility you’re autistic, but then I saw you already figured that out. Which is great, honestly. So many people go through these exact things and never get to figure out why they struggle with things so much, and if you don’t know then you can never learn to accomodate yourself.

Autism is a very valid reason why social interaction is difficult for you. Why being in the same house with people is difficult for you. Why keeping up conversations is difficult for you. Why hanging out with people is difficult for you. Why keeping a job may be difficult for you. Why school was so exhausting for you. Why parasocial relationships are easier for you. Selective mutism could also be being semiverbal which is also an autistic trait.

The thing with being neurodivergent is that there isn’t anything _wrong_ with you, but you operate in a different way. There is no pill that “fixes” autism, because it’s not a disease. It’s a brain that works a little differently - and that is okay.

This means, though, that certain things may not work for you. For example: living with people may be unpleasant for you. Same here. Talking to random people for me isn’t pleasant either, _unless_ they are also neurodivergent. For me, this is the absolute key. My advice to you would also be to seek out people using autistic spaces, there are subreddits for people with autism and people you find there may be easier for you to talk to. I quite literally exclusively hang out with other neurodivergents. It just kind of happened that way because it’s so much easier and so much more pleasant.

With therapy: if your therapist doesn’t know you’re autistic, things they say to you or advice you to do may straight up not work. Advice for neurotypicals doesn’t work on us, our brains are different. I’d recommend seeking out an autism diagnosis and also if at all possible, a therapist who specializes in autism. We need a different approach.

You’re also absolutely not dumb. You may just not thrive on the neurotypical-focussed school system. I didn’t either.

For jobs, something that’s really doable for me is production work. It’s the same task over and over again. Nothing unexpected. There are very few people. I just get to do my thing while I listen to my podcasts and music all day. Super sustainable.


You’re not a child, you just haven’t learned how to properly accomodate yourself yet, and do things in a way that works for you. I promise that once you do that, things will be easier. They may still not be a walk in the park, but they will be easier. Keep your head up, friend."	bodieslaughing	reply	na	na	na	0.9993582367897034	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealth

First of all a 19yr old is still half a child mentally. You will realize this when you grow up. There is nothing wrong in that. Just enjoy what you like to do. Don't try to fake things to please others. Everyone is going through the same thing, it just appears that they have their shot together but everyone has issues but they are hiding them. 

Try to find stuff you enjoy. Go for walks early in the morning. Join the gym( it will be hard in the beginning but it will become a routine) you will feel super good after the gym.

"For context, I have only been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, ADHD, and ""extreme"" depression and anxiety. I have believed I am a psychopath for a while now. I have intensive thoughts of hurting/killing people, to the point where they're not just intrusive thoughts, they're actual fantasies to make me feel better. It's to the point where I am afraid someday they will not be fantasies anymore, and if that day comes I will not feel bad. Everybody has rejected or abandoned me, and I view other people as self-rightous and thinking that they're better than people like me. I personally believe that people who think they are better than me and who reject me deserve the worst kind of suffering, and for that I would not feel remorse if I hurt anybody like that nor would I feel bad if something happened to them. I have frequent depressive, manic episodes that make me very unstable and impulsive and have caused others to leave and abandon me. Whenever anybody rejects or leaves me (which happens numerous times throughout my life) I feel intense anger and fantasize (and sometimes even plan out, whether seriously or hypothetically) about hurting or killing people. I also am able to view both depictions and real life footage of extreme suffering and not only view it with ease, but gain stimulation from it. I realize that there is very little sympathy for people like me, which makes me hate people even more and wish suffering upon them. Despite all of this, I am capable of love. I love animals, especially my baby angel kitties who I would protect with my life and would never ever harm them. I am capable of caring about people, with the number one person being my mom. Anybody else I'm capable of caring about but when they show that they do not care about me back or reject/abandon me I have fantasies of hurting them. I don't really have any friends, I have one friend I talk to but they don't care about me, at least not in the same way I do for them. I feel like if I do not gain the social satisfaction and stimulation that I desperately seek, I am very capable of hurting others. Am I a psychopath/sociopath, or do I have something else? There's definitely other things I have that I have not been diagnosed with. I just want to hear other people's thoughts, and please don't be too judgemental.

Who knows? Maybe you are just deeply hurt with some repressed trauma. This is above reddits paygrade.	Mitchellindahouse10	reply	na	na	na	0.3174159526824951	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth
"The void hears you...

The correct answer is sociopath, and it is really common when you have a lot of emotions, but not a great understanding of them. Emotional control and empathy are not easy for those on the Autism Spectrum, and because of this it is often thought they cannot improve or change it. However, like with any skill it can be improved, but it requires mindfulness, knowledge, and practice. Practice makes habits.

Meditation and replacement thoughts are good practices for everyone in some capacity. More so in this case. Meditation to center and replacement to try and see things from another point of view.

Definitely need to tell a mental health professional how you're feeling and not give into those pleasures. I guess to you it's like an addiction now and coping mechanism, but any addiction that's not healthy needs to be worked on, so please don't suffer alone. You can't help how you're feeling, and we're not here to judge. You are you at the end of the day you were made this way and it's good that you can recognise that it's probably not okay to be having these thoughts is at least a step in the right direction.

"For a couple of weeks now, I have been extremely tired all the time. I'm often restless, agitated and sleepy. I'm sleeping for many hours a day, taking multiple long naps somedays to just be able to eat, drink, sit on my phone and use the toilet. I have made appointments with my psychiatrist and my GP to rule out any other reasons this might be caused. I took a blood test not too long ago, but before the fatigue symptoms got very bad, and I only have vitamin D deficiency. I'm taking my psych meds with my vitamin D when I wake up and I'm taking magnesium supplements before bed to help me sleep better, but it hasn't gotten any better.


I will discuss the other potential medical reasons with my doctors, but for now I just need to learn how to cope with it. It's hot and I'm bored and depressed and everything seems to not get any better. I don't have a job or any type of social life, online and offline, and now I can't even live peacefully in my own home. I'm trying to get sunlight even when I can't get myself to go outside, I'm drinking plenty of water and eating normally. I'm out of ideas and it's making me feel miserable.

"Hey... I'm new here
I guess I just need to vent a bit but also would like some advice.
So um I've always struggled with depression and anxiety, and couple of days ago I got an ADHD diagnosis which is probably connect to that. I'm 22 so it's really weird to realise something like that about my self so late.

Anyway I've lost my older brother to a suic!de a year and a half ago. It was really unexpected, I was always the ""problematic child"" and he didn't show any signs really, so it came as a shock and absolutely shatterd my mom and my other brother.

So here's the thing, I kinda feel like he's gone and a huge chunk of something that connected me to this living world just went with him.
I barley sleep, I barley eat, my psychiatric meds has doubled theire dose in the last year and I keep taking them! It's just... idk It's gone.

It's 1:30 am rn in my country, I haven't slept for  more then 48 hours and I can't bring myself to move.
In less then two days I'm going to retake my math hs finals at a higher level to make my university acceptece chances higher and I haven't solved a single equation in the last 3 days. 
I feel like I'm falling apart from the inside and my family isn't strong enough to catch me from this fall. 
I was pretty numb about my own deteriorating till now.
I got from my bed to go to the bathroom, it's less then a ten steps walk,  from the moment I got up till the moment I crushed on the toilet I had the biggest, strongest dizziness I have ever felt in my life. It was so bad I thought I was about to puke for a moment.
I'm pretty sure that's because of a bad food intake from my part.  I can't bring myself to eat anything if I'm not hungry and at the same time  It's like I've lost my appetite for life. 
I have no idea how much I weight but last time I've checked I wasn't far from underwheight. I know something is really wrong with me but idk how to fix it.

It's true that in the last two days I was on a lot of attents pills and coffee, but I've also made sure to eat enough
 Or so I thought. My dizzy voyage to piss city makes me doubt that now.
Idk what to do, I feel so lost.
I'm not suic!dal and I don't have an ED. I take my meds and going to therapy and do everything right then why do I keep falling like this? And how can I fix myself, like right now, when I can't even go to the goddamn toilet.

"The void hears you...

The mind is a garden, a palace, and the worst of hell. Like a garden it needs to be fed, watered, and tended for it to bloom. Like a palace it is built brick by brick of our memories, feelings, and choices. Like hell it is often where we are tortured the most.

Sometimes we don't know how to feel about something, so we follow what those around us feel. Sometimes we get overwhelmed by the things we put aside to get done what we need to. Sometimes we lose ourselves by looking at the things around us we cannot change.

I am a sixteen year old male, but I don’t think this affects my problem at all. My mental health is almost always good, I have slight stuff that upsets me but I always overlook those I don’t let stuff interfere with my life almost ever. But very rarely I have complete mental breakdowns over stuff I have almost no problem with. Such as last night I had a meltdown about feeling sick to my stomach by any food especially sweets , I am a little anxious about my appearance and such but it doesn’t affect any of my actions, but this was something different. I was convincing myself everything was bad for me and was starving myself but finally that relieved (I’m fine now, except for sweets are still a little revolting). Another instance is that I had a meltdown about getting an erection, like complete and utter crisis mode, I’ve never had a big problem with those I mean sometimes they can be annoying but I felt like I had an inescapable problem and that I hated every slight sexual urge I got, this thought lasted a night aswell, and this is opposite of what I believe I want sexual attraction.

"I was born, I grew up, went to school, finished and worked, paid taxes and that’s it. Here I am broke, not interested in life and barely making it through the days. 

I find myself more happy with the blinds closed, in bed, nothing but a fan on and under the sheets. I just don’t see the point in this existence we call life. I don’t have friends, I’m a social butterfly but I am a homebody, an introvert and just always been a loner. If I’m not working, I’m home with loops of instrumentals on and laying in bed. I look around me and people are happy, they have money, they can go out, do what they want and drive their dream cars. Again, I’m not materialistic but there’s things I wish I had too, like an awesome girlfriend that’s nice, loving, caring, honest, loyal, sarcastic, goofy and laid back. I would love a dream car, would love a nice house, and a pet or two. 

But Al that is far from me. Realistically, I’m broke, live check to check, never hurt a person, never broke someone’s heart and always wore my heart on my sleeves but I feel like every time I get 2 steps ahead, I fall back like 10 steps. It’s like life doesn’t want me here or I feel like I don’t belong here. I don’t remember the last time I smiled genuinely or was happy or had a gift or a birthday, etc. most nights I wish I didn’t wake up but then I wake up and I am pissed that I woke up. Sometimes I wish I can go back in time to childhood and start over but then I may have to go through all this all over again so I’d rather wake up in a new world or anywhere else where I can start fresh. I wish it was that easy, like a “game over” screen and you start again.

I went to therapy for help with my dissociation and extremely limited emotional capacity and I explained that to him when I first got there. He argued with me over semantics and then said there was nothing he could do to help me. I was due for 6 1 hour sessions over the course of 6 weeks but after he said that I left and I don't plan on returning. Am I past the point of no return? The only thing I've felt since December 2021 was some slight anxiety over recieving my exam results in August 2022. Other than that I've completely withdrawn socially and I seem to be cutting off the few friends I had without even realizing it. I'm indifferent to criticism but actively avoid praise. I don't know what could be causing this. What little I do now is to maintain the status quo and avoid physical discomfort. If context is necessary I have an ASD diagnosis and a history of anxiety going back to 9/10 years old with depression from 11 years old that's subsided and returned irregularly.

I have no idea how to do this real life friend thing... also object permanence issues and forgetting people exist is a thing.

So if you find someone or something to distract you chances are you will forget about the relationship or not think of it as much over time. It will hurt but things become more manageable overtime.

"So to put it simply and upfront, I believe I have BPD. The psychiatrist I had when I was in the army (recently separated) told me I have many of the markers for it, but because of my transitioning out there wasn’t adequate time to deep dive into it (this was after my FIRST psychiatrist was having conflicting views on what I potentially had, therefore leaving me unheard). Another therapist I had while in diagnosed me with generalized anxiety disorder, a given considering my extensive history of childhood abuse. 

The reason I’m here to get advice is, is that I have tried talking to mental health professional about what I believe is wrong with me. I have speculation that it is definitely BPD, possibly ADHD. I have extensive reasons/behaviors as to why I believe so. But as I am waiting and waiting to be seen by VA mental health professionals, I have been making this spiral down that making my marriage extremely difficult. Making everyday life extremely difficult. 

I am having extreme bouts of anger, a very quick temperament, issues with dissociation throughout the days, intense emotional volatility, issues with blame shifting and I would say ego issues, crazy disorganization and more. My mom was diagnosed with ADHD and BPD, so there is at least family history. Like, I could keep going with the symptoms and behaviors I have for both of the disorders, but it would just be too many paragraphs of it. 

I don’t know how to get these mental health professionals to take me seriously. They continually tell me it’s only anxiety, that it’s probably just the stressors of life. If I’m being honest, many of my female friends that were in with me dealt with the same thing, being told it’s only anxiety. 

I know I’m not as heavily affected by ADHD (given that I have it) as my husband, who quite literally cannot function without adderall. But I KNOW there is something wrong with me. Normal people don’t have as much emotional disregulation as me, the frequent thoughts of suicide with no intention of following through, intense fear or abandonment and the utter state of DISASTER our house is in. Like I said before, the list goes on. 

I don’t know what to do. Something has to change with me. DBT therapy did not quite help, anxiety medication has not helped. I don’t know how to get these people to stop what feels like gaslighting, telling me to literally “JUST RELAX”. If I’m viewing any of this wrong, please tell me."

"**I believe I have BPD. The psychiatrist I had in the army told me I have many markers for it.**

Ambitious, BPD is not something -- like chickenpox -- that you either ""have"" or ""don't have."" Instead, it is a spectrum disorder, which means every adult on the planet occasionally exhibits all 9 BPD traits to some degree (usually at a low level if the person is healthy).  
  
At issue, then, is not whether you exhibit BPD traits. Of course you do. We all do. Rather, at issue is whether you exhibit those traits at a strong level (i.e., are on the upper end of the BPD spectrum). Although strong BPD symptoms are easy to spot by a person who knows you very well and knows what red flags to look for, only a professional can determine whether they are so severe and persistent as to constitute a full-blown disorder.  
  
BPD is a pattern of primitive ego defenses we all use. They become a problem only when our BPD symptoms become so strong and persistent that they undermine our ability to sustain very close LTRs with other adults.  
  
Black-white thinking, for example, is an amazing skill we all can be proud of -- when it is used correctly and in moderation. It is one of the primitive defenses we all use even in adulthood. Indeed, our brains are hardwired to instantly switch to B-W thinking whenever we are startled or experience intense fears or strong feelings.  
  
The beauty of B-W thinking is that it is incredibly fast and thus likely has saved your life many times. For example, when you are in a crosswalk and suddenly look up to see a truck bearing down on you, your mind is capable of thinking only ""jump left"" or ""jump right."" B-W thinking nonetheless produces disastrous results when used to understand the intentions and motivations of other people, particularly when you're in a close relationship.  
  
The human condition is that, whenever we experience very intense feelings, our judgment flies out the window because those strong feelings color and distort our perception of other peoples' intentions and motivations. Significantly, this is true for all of us.  
  
This is why, whenever we are very angry, we all try hard to keep our mouths shut -- and our fingers off the keys -- until we have a chance to cool down. We know we cannot trust our own judgment while we are experiencing intense feelings. Well, a pwBPD (person with BPD) is like this too -- only these distorted perceptions occur far more frequently because he lacks the emotional skills needed to regulate his own emotions.  
  
If you suffer from full-blown BPD, you likely experienced a trauma in early childhood (from inherited genes and/or your environment) that prevented you from acquiring certain emotional skills and from developing a strong self-image. Most major cities offer excellent treatment programs (e.g., DBT, TFP, and CBT) that can teach you the emotional skills needed to regulate your own emotions.

**DBT therapy did not quite help.**

How long did you do DBT therapy, Ambitious? I ask because it requires many years to learn the important emotional skills. Like a person learning to play a piano, a pwBPD must work hard for many years in a weekly training program (e.g., DBT) to acquire those missing skills. One study (by John Gunderson & Frank Yeomans) estimates that 8 to 16 years are required.

I therefore suggest you find out by seeing a psychologist who is experienced with treating patients having strong BPD traits. If you live near a good-sized city, you will find a list of available psychologists in the [Find a Therapist](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists) directory at *Psychology Today*. For a DBT specialist in your area, take a look at the [Find a DBT Therapist](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/dialectical-dbt) directory.

It tells you where they are located, what areas of psychiatry they specialize in, and whether they offer tele-therapy. This link points you to the directory for cities here in the United States. If you are in another country, go to the home page to select another country.

Moreover, a wealth of DBT information is available at [DBT Self Help](https://www.dbtselfhelp.com/), which contains many DBT videos and links to resources. This site was primarily written by pwBPD who have taken the DBT training and are describing what they experienced and learned. They also provide a list of recommended DBT workbooks. Some professionals also contribute to that site."	Ambitious_Bad_3180	reply	na	na	na	0.997582197189331	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealth

"Whether you are a teen or an adult, you might have to first shore up your support system and consider you own emotional safety. I have a parent and a sibling and a best friend who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia. My entire childhood and on into my young adulthood was spent making sense of that and all the other stuff that comes with mental illness. 

In addition to the very good suggestions and information her, remember YOU cannot admit your mom and families of people with mental illness struggle with this day-in-day-out. It was pretty traumatic to *want* to understand my parent or to keep my sibling safe and not be in turmoil, and not really be able to help. I would stand around in a park making a scene or walking down a road after them — sometimes I could handle it but in the long run I couldn’t wish their illness away, love it away, or logic it away.  

Check out National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, they have support for family members and sometimes workshops. Making crisis plans, managing crisis, interacting with the system, and taking care of yourself is a lot, but it does get easier over time, even if their illness does not change. I picked up some skills along the way on what to do in crisis and how to advocate for folks on the psych ward and now help others. 

But if I could tell my younger self anything, it would be to remind myself how scary things are, that none of it was my fault, and accepting their illness is not the same as giving up.

She needs to want to change, see a treatment team, a psych Dr, and take her meds. As long as this continues, she will make all of your lives Hell. 3 days admission sounds right because long term hospitalization is a thing of the past. This is done to prevent abuse and violation of personal liberty. You can't just commit her. A person has to want to change. This is going to sound harsh, but if she will not get help, then you and everyone need to separate from her and let her reach rock bottom.

when i was a kid i had a dream of me in the night walking through long corridors of my building while seeing big spiders and seeing shadow figrues, it was the same as an dph/dxm trip the next day a dream about seeing spiders in my bed, and dreams about being in delirium ,dream about a full white like a blank space where i nedded to roll a big ball and i didn't want to do it but when i tried to make it stop the next day i dreamt the same thing, after 7 days of dreaming this, i accepted it and never dreamt it from that point on like a dmt tries to help with acceptance and frequently dreaming about entities talking a unknown language but i somehow understood it, after the experiences i had a kind of body high. Now from nightmares i get a body high. many things that i never did i just do it instantly.I started to just know what is going to happen and that somehow everything happens as i will even to this point. i have visual snow so maybe its a hppd from a realese of drugs in my brain somehow, or a past life thing.weed is making my ears ring and sound like im underwater and lose perspective like im watching everything from a screen, nothing feels real, could this be derealisation?

I think there's a good reason (not a BS) reason you're keeping going. We all know we only have one life and we should never stop striving to make that life worth living. I encourage you to get into therapy if you can, it can be extremely helpful to help you understand the root causes of your painful emotions.

My advice is to at least try and support your sisters, meanwhile try making money with a job and a side hustle or whatever that's what I'm currently doing.

"Hi all! (Warning, probably gonna be a long post.) So I've struggled with anxiety and depression since I was about 10 (I'm 20F), and at the end of my senior year of high school I got into my first real, long term, good relationship. Previously I'd had an abusive boyfriend earlier in high school, but I had had time to work through the trauma of that before starting this relationship. We stayed together and did long distance at different colleges for a little over a year, and it was a picture-perfect high school sweethearts relationship and we were completely head over heels for each other. Fast forward to a year into our relationship, and I had a sort-of mental health crisis where my anxiety completely skyrocketed and I could not calm down at all, to the point of making emergency calls to my psychiatrist and almost admitting myself to a psych hospital. All the while I was with my boyfriend at the time, and these sudden intrusive thoughts were SCREAMING at me to get away from him, break up with him, that I don't love him, etc. I had had doubts like any normal human being about my relationship being right for me but pushed through because I loved him, but it was like I couldn't escape these thoughts and they were coming at me full force and the only way I could partially relieve the symptoms was to not be around him. And this happened the day before our one year anniversary, and we had to essentially cancel all of our plans because of my freakout. A few weeks later it wasn't much better and I had to break up with him because my mental health was not stable enough to be with him and I was really confused about my feelings, and writing this now that was over a year ago (this happened March/April 2022) I'm still not fully over it or over him, and I find myself constantly coming back to it and wondering if it would have worked out in any other scenario or if there was something I could have done to make it work. My anxiety and depression is somewhat better now and since the breakup I've come to terms with the fact that we are very different people who wanted different things and didn't have much in common, but on the other hand it feels like my brain forced me to break up with him and I can't deny how strong my feelings were/are for him. Now I'm wondering if this was self sabotage or whether it was my gut instincts kicking in and telling me I need to move on, and since he was my first love and it was an amicable break up it just makes it all so much harder. Has anyone had experience with still loving someone but breaking up with them anyways or still being unsure if you made the right decision about a breakup? I apologize for the long post, I'm just now sort of getting into Reddit and any sort of support/advice would mean a lot. If you've gotten this far in this essay of a post, thank you for listening <3

Also I forgot to mention, after we broke up we continued to talk and hook up and pretty much still date without the label for a good 6-8 months before we realized that we may not be able to be friends and set boundaries well enough to stay in contact. We no longer follow each other on social media or talk to each other, but I still sometimes struggle with that and want to reach out to him."

"The void hears you...

While this sub is more focused on the mental health of people and usually acts like a therapy session. We think that a good answer to this is as follows.

First, we are different people as we grow up. Not only do our bodies die and get remade, but our minds shift and adapt. So, yes perhaps it was good to pull away, and give yourself and them time.

Second, many people have lingering regrets about people, places, and things. So talk about it with them, get closure about it, and try to find a center you can be content with.

Lastly, what do you miss most about it all? Emotion is a tricky devil that can hide simple truths, so think about what you miss the most. Let that be a gauge."	NeitherSpread8679	reply	na	na	na	0.9883484840393066	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth
"can't really put this in a sex related reddit because it's more trauma related and idk where to put this so if anyone has any good places to put this let me know. This is half venting and half a question, the question being just really what am I feeling? is there a term or am I just traumatized and hate them lol. I can't figure it out and I can't figure out how to prevent feeling like this.

i (f17) am really sexually repulsed by most if not all older men, and feel a huge discomfort around them. not only that but it's especially my brothers and my father. I grew up in a household where both my brothers (m23) (m19) would take everything out on me 24/7 and my dad(m60) stands by and watches, and also screams at me, verbally and physically too abuses me just like my brothers do. my mom tries to support me and she agrees they're terrible but it's nothing I can do because she loves her husband and her sons and can't just leave them or something, and to her it's not that bad that leaving is a good choice. to mention my mom is a complete control freak and wants everything done the moment it's even mentioned, it's all very intense when every manchild in your life has INSANE anger issues and your mom is a complete neat freak, it goes like mom wants thing done, I don't do it exactly how she wants and then my brothers or dad are hurting me over it because ""I can't do anything right"" when I'm the one who does everything for them when they refuse to do it because they're actual children. 

I'm on vacation right now, and here are the things my brothers have given me violence threats over, screamed at me over, or actually hurt me over in the past week.

>I tried to say hi to a dog ( the dog was standing and we were all waiting for my mom to find directions, I asked to pet the dog and they said ok but apparently i was DISTRACTING them and my younger brother got so mad he punched a wall and yelled and did a little trantrum and left)
>I wanted to eat a peice of my own candy (apparently my older brother has to feel the need to control me so badly I can't eat a peice of candy that I bought for myself as a desert after we ate at a resturant, he actually went insane)
>I asked for my snotty tissue my older brothers mug was on so I could prevent my him from using it and apparently that was too much for him ( tried to lunge at me in the kitchen, sauing how much he wishes he could hurt me)
> took too long in a bathroom, I took 10 minutes because I was legitimately ill and almost shat myself on the train (my younger brother started berating me and insulting me until I had a mental breakdown in a public train station and I couldn't breathe so bad I had to sit down on the floor in which he started insulting me and my dad started screaming at me to get off the floor, the entire time they both were shitting on me for taking too long and being sensitive)
> said Samsung wasn't a bad phone brand (younger brother broke his sunglasses in a fit of rage in the car, stomped on them like a little kid and threw them out the window of a moving car while we were on a bridge)
>leaned on a rental car (I got off and younger brother ended up spitting on me anyways and yelling at me)


anyways, I know they'd never assault me or harm me in a sexual way because we are family, but often I'm just given a disgusting nauseous feeling when I'm around any of them. it's like the feeling of being objectified and looked at like a young woman, prey or a target and not an individual, i feel like im always being targeted and i am not seen as a person. it happens more often when I'm showing more skin which makes me think it's something rooted in sexual discomfort but I have no idea, I think now writing this it's not sexual it's just the feeling of being safer when I'm wearing more covering clothes around them. I feel disgusting and it makes me want to run away, I have no clue what to do. for my situation of  abuse there isn't much for me to do, I'm kind of stuck here. yes, I've called the cops on my family before, and cps, but nothing happens and I'm just trying to tough it out by now. I'm going to college and hopefully things can be good then, but now I'm just disgusted by this feeling. I don't know how to get rid of it and it ruins my mood so often. I can't even stay in a room alone with my brothers or father if not I get a fight or flight response. they absolutely disgust me, all of their faces and their voices and even them breathing and sighing makes me so frustrated. even thinking about them makes me feel disgusting in my own skin. I can't stand living with them or being around them and I'm planning on cutting them off as soon as I can for my own sanity, I was just wondering if there's anything like this that has a name or is a real thing or if I'm just losing it."

"Sadly I don’t know either if this what you’re experiencing has a name or not. I’m sure it does, but I don’t know it. That being said, going by what you’re describing, it is obvious that you’re definitely in a toxic relationship with your family. I’m sorry to hear you have to tough it out and that no one near you wants to help out. Have you tried talking to your neighbors or other family members? 
Whatever the reason for their behavior is, it’s definitely not sane and nothing you should have to deal with. But as so often in life, you are left to deal with it. Not knowing all the details, I can only advice to tough it out, talk to your friends and family and try to find a way to get out of there asap. Either wait till you’re 18, so that you have more rights or ask for someone to take you in so that you can get away asap. But that might be a bit too hard to do depending on where your live and your local laws. Don’t lose hope and no, you’re not losing it, they’re being disrespectful and awful to you. What you could try to do for now is stay away as much as possible and interact with them only when strictly necessary. Try to meet friends more often and have more time to yourself that way.

I don't know if this will help you, but it has helped me recently. I am envisioning myself playing my own player character. Like I am watching myself from a 3rd angle and try to decide the best action for me and then execute it. It makes me feel like I am less trapped by my own mood. My character may be in a shit mood, but the person playing me still wants me to go study today. This approach lets me get a sense of objectivity and detachment, I think this is kind of what growing up is. Instead of the inner child in myself demanding my needs to be met right then and there, there is a calm and collected voice in me now that knows whats better for me long term.	junaidd09	reply	na	na	na	0.9988815188407898	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealth
"Hi, I need a advice please. 

Always when I am drinking or I am drunk I start to feel anxious, thinking about suicide, being in deppresions, thinking about hurting myself and telling to myself that my life isnt worth anything. 

Last time I almost hurt myself and I was sitting in the corner of the room where I was absolutely unable to do anything (but not because I was so drunk, it was because I thought that others wanted to do something bad to me). 

But on the other side, when I am drunk I can sometimes open myself to others, but I need some person I really really trust and just eye to eye contact between 2 ppl.

 Is it just me who are having these feelings when drunk? Should I avoid some situations when I am drunk? Is something bad with me? Should I speak to someone about it? Any other advice? Should I stop drinking (I am drinking max 2 times a month)?"	UpstairsAmbassador61	post	18.340915249037796	male	White	0.9951281547546387	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
You could talk to someone if you trust them well enough, I find people generally react better than we give them credit for. You could also go to therapy to look around your suicidal tendencies and depression and ways to cope with it. Alcohol is a depressant so you will naturally feel sadder on it, I find it can put me in a moody more honest state of mind which is ok if you stay in control of yourself and don’t entertain any impulses but if you find it too much you could go through a period of sobriety and do some introspection in your issues and what you can do to fix them. I had the same problem when I was 19, I’d drink and then feel disconnected and depressed and teeter towards killing myself, it scared me so I stopped drinking. The next two times I drunk i tried to kill my self each time only to be stopped by the police. I learnt a lot from those experiences and learnt to love myself over the coming years after deciding. I’m not happy but I am getting there :) Learn to separate your negative thoughts from the reality of it all, that most things aren’t the end of the world.

"I am an 18-year-old recent graduate who left high school a few months ago. I am currently trying to find a job and get my driver's permit. However, many of these things are out of my control. I recently moved to another city, making it difficult for me to see my friends and meet new people, especially since there are no social groups nearby. I live with an emotionally abusive father who often fails to understand me, causing problems for our family. As a result, I try my best to ignore him.  
  
I feel isolated, spending my days at home doing nothing but playing video games, watching shows, and working on whatever progress I can make towards getting my driver's permit or finding a job. Unfortunately, these factors are beyond my control, and I have to wait a whole month before I can take my test again.  
  
Overall, I feel hopeless and depressed about my life. I have given up on myself and my potential, simply existing and waiting for my life to end without any purpose. I want to disappear and believe that I don't matter to the world. I feel pathetic and as if I am no longer the main character in my own life. I just want to have some control over my life, earn money, go out with friends, and work on myself. However, it seems like I don't have the privilege to do so, which intensifies my desire to disappear.

I'll share my experience. I've suffered from intense feelings of depression and hopelessness a lot in my life. I considered suicide often, but the thing which stopped me from attempting it was the realisation that I hadn't yet tried every single other option to improve my life, and if I killed myself, I'd never have found out if there was a way to succeed in making my life worthwhile. I was often at the crossroads of option 1: suicide, option 2: that thing which is so unfathomably hard to do but I haven't tried it yet. I kept choosing option 2 and over the course of several years, my life improved, and now it's looking super positive and I haven't felt depression or suicidality in months. I highly recommend getting into therapy too as it helped me enormously. I'm a male former incel too btw.	Darksoul12233	reply	na	na	na	0.9983978867530823	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealth

Lately I've been getting those thoughts, kinda like flashbacks, about SA received when little. 
The thing is I don't remember my childhood (I remember just a couple of episodes) and I usually have intrusive thoughts so I don't know if it's just my brain messing with me or of it actually happened. Because I don't really trust my brain, I end up not believing it, however those 'flashbacks' have been popping up frequently and I hate it.

The brain is a weird complex thing. As a trauma responses, our brains can quite literally block out traumatic memories. This happened to me when I was in my early 20s and something made it unravel and I remembered a lot of my trauma. Intrusive thoughts can also (and very often) be due to trauma as well. Personally, when I think of these memories I feel very disconnected from it as if it wasn't me and it was someone else. Are these memories causing you distress? Or do you keep just remembering and are disconnected from it like me?	Medusa_h	reply	na	na	na	0.9978922009468079	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealth

"Hello. I spent years trying to figure out if my SA flashbacks were real or just intrusive thoughts (I suffer from those, severe OCD in my childhood). 

It made me question which of my thoughts were real or not... 

I would go through deep memory dives and try to compare memories to see which ones felt ""real"" or intrusive.

In the end, through deep thought and coping techniques, I was able to realize the flashbacks were real. They made me feel ways no intrusive thought ever had. The paralyzing body experience and sudden flashbacks were definitely me remembering SA I experienced and had tried to repress for years. 

This is my own personal experience. Yours may be different. I hope for you that they were just intrusive thoughts 🙏 but also don't be afraid to admit to yourself if you think SA really did happen to you. Acceptance can feel impossible but it's a first step to recovery.

"  
I'll share some depression advice that many people here have said is helpful. It includes advice for getting enjoyment out of things.  
  
I can tell you some self-help things but I'm not saying necessarily that these are all you need. Treating a serious case of depression with nothing but self-help is risky.  
  
  
A famous psychiatrist, Abraham Low, said that when we can't control our feelings we can still control our muscles. If you tell your arms and legs to get you out of bed, they will obey. Count down from 10 and at zero, move with all your might.  
  
  
Try this when it seems that you're too tired to work. Lie on the couch, close your eyes, and get ready to work by imagining yourself working for 5 minutes. Think in terms of taking it step by step and starting with something really easy.  
  
  
Taking things in baby steps - very important. This is the key to motivation and motivation is the key to recovery.  
  
  
Just 20 min of brisk walking a day can help, and you can add to that gradually so long as you don't make yourself sick of exercise with too much.  
  
  
This is a motivation trick that's been used in behavior modification programs since the 1930s. If a task seems like it's too big, think of it as a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time, and start with something really, really easy. Cleaning - start by cleaning for 3 or 4 min and take a 5 min break. Homework - start by proofreading a paper or previewing a chapter you're going to read by looking at headings, sub-headings, etc.  
  
  
You can even use the baby steps principle for having fun. If you're not getting any enjoyment out of things, here's something people here have said is helpful with that problem. Look all over and do a complete inventory. You should be able to find at least one or two things you like, such as your favorite music or movie. If there's just one movie you like, watch it once or twice. Then, find movies that are like it in some way - with similar story or the same actor. Keep adding to your entertainment supply to give it variety.  
  
  
If you're thinking about professional help, treatment usually begins by seeing the GP, who can give you a referral. I mention referral because just a bottle of pills is not a very good approach. The things you'd want to tell the doctor are how you feel at different times of day, any symptoms you might have such as change in appetite or sleep, and things in your life affecting how you feel.  
  
  
If you're depressed, I can't tell you exactly what you need. There's no one size fits all solution. I can tell you though that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits.  
  
  
Video, below - details about self-help based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and lifestyle choices that help with depression - nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise, and social support, also traditional Asian methods.

"Hey so just a question.

I know a girl, and she’s had a lot of mental health issues and trauma in her life. She does I think over embellish a bit, and possibly mix up different events, or even lie. I’m not quite sure and obviously I don’t want to talk badly about it, but I noticed something she does;

When you’re having a regular conversation, she will interject something traumatic into the conversation. And I don’t mean occasionally, I mean every time, within a minute of talking. 

I’m just curious what this might be? Is it a way to cope? Or a specific disorder? Or is it a manipulation tactic to try get sympathy?

I understand as I’ve been through quite a lot of trauma myself, but it seems like she doesn’t want help? I know I can’t help her or be a saviour, she’s been in the system for years. But it was just curious that she interjects it into every conversation, even if it’s completely unrelated in anyway…

Like you could talk about the happiest conversation on earth then immediately goes to suicide or death or abuse..

It’s called trauma dumping. And it is draining to hear it when it’s out of the blue. So tell her that before she’s gonna vent something that traumatized her, or is extreme in that same sense, to let you know so you can either choose to listen or not. If she’s got a problem with that then there’s something wrong.	LandscapeBitter	reply	na	na	na	0.9854544401168823	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealth

I'm 21m going into my senior year of college. I have so much going on in my life I don't know where to begin. I'll try my best. Back in high school I used to be so care free. I didn't really stress about life much. I used to get mediocre grades. When I got a bad grade I would just brush it off and move on. I didn't have many friends or a very close friend where I live for various reasons. My mother was also really strict so I never went out or to parties. My life was pretty dull. I began to complain about how my life is being wasted and I wanted to go out and do fun stuff. Then I got to college and things improve a lot. I met a good group of friends and go to do stuff and finally have a life. In college my mom would flip out on me for having a bad grade on an assignment even though my overall grades are really good. She would threaten me and yell. I wish she was more understanding and I could talk to her. Instead I am afraid of her. This semester I did well overall, but things got very bad and I ended up failing a class. I didn't tell anyone. I have been dealing with a lot from school because my degree audit has been messed up. So I've been constantly trying to figure out if I will graduate on time. All of these things have been causing me a ton of stress and anxiety to the point thinking about it I feel like I'm going to have a panic attack. I sometimes deal with things by laughing or joking about it. I tried talking to my friend's about it. When I mentioned I failed the class they seemed to be judgmental and I feel stupid for telling them. I can't really explain it, but I wish I has one very close friend that I could relate to and help me. I feel so alone sometimes and like the world doesn't understand me. I don't know what to do?

"I can't give you much advice i feel you.

I am 17 , I'm a waste i have 0 friends and extreme social anxiety ever since I came into the uk, i am lazy and spent all my day playing games but im still happy due to 1 single thing.

My perspective in life has always saved me. For example what does it take to be successful and have a good life? Degrees? Hell no, you dedicate yourself to something you enjoy and you can easily make money. Ask yourself , are those classes you want to complete something you want to do in your life or are you wasting time, people don't realise that there is so much time in this world, your only 21, you can be and choose what you want to do and if you put your mind to it you will achieve it.

Cut all ties with the negative bullshit in your life and do something that will actually help you in the future, there are people i know making lots of money when a couple of years ago they were working their ass of at hotels and supermarkets.

I know i write like shit and you probably didn't understand shit, after all i have ADHD , but what I'm tryna say is that you have to do something for the future what will make you successful and will give you and your family a good life."

"So the thing is... i have to relearn stuff that i didn't have in my childhood sadly.

One of those things is emotions and feelings.

So... basically i often meet with friends. and it's really great, i love it. but after we leave and i get home it hits really hard with depressive episodes and stuff.

For what i could ""find out"" it's basically because those meetings are full of emotions and feelings. pretty much only good ones to my luck. but that is... kinda the problem too. I couldn't learn all those good and happy feelings in my childhood. they weren't really that present.

And those emotions and feelings are way too overwhelming while i need to learn them and stuff.

While the meetings help me greatly, there's still a lot to learn and stuff. but with those bad episodes after each one i can't really enjoy thinking about the meetings beforehand because i know it'll hit hard after that. and that sometimes gives me thoughts of not wanting to go but when i'm not going i can't learn and heal.

&#x200B;

so... is there maybe a way to go around that? or maybe a other way to learn all those emotions and stuff without that kind of ""exposure therapy""? (online stuff doesn't help)

Nobody learns emotions, we feel them. It seems to me you are experiencing a lot of painful emotions like depression. These emotions can't be changed by 'learning' other, more positive emotions. There is a always a reason for every emotion. I encourage you to get into therapy and explore the reasons for your depression. IMO this is your best chance at improving your depressive episodes. IMO, when you see your friends, you are not 'learning happiness' -- that's impossible and trying to do this will most likely lead to confusion and frustration.

Okay so I am a Romanian citizen that has moved to the uk 5 years ago( i am now almost 18 as I'm writing this)
I was known for always speaking too much, it didn't matter that you were, a girl or a boy, I always had good conversation with everyone, i always made loads of friends, and whenever i saw a girl i liked i could not stop talking to her even in lessons , this was all in my home country, however me and my loving family moved into the uk.
Over the last 4-5 years ive spent in the uk school (year 9-13) I have never made a single friend or had s conversation longer than 10-15 minutes, it got the point where I was hearing everyone calling me the quiet kid and i could not do anything about it,  i would rather be tortured with lava than talk and say something in the classroom unless i was privately speaking with someone. This gets much worse when I am setting next to any girls no matter who she is , i can't even say a damn word, i miss every single party even the last day of school which was a ball/banquet.

I have a lot of social anxiety sometimes. It is very common but really difficult. Honestly I'm positive many people at your school have it too and they are just not brave enough to admit it. You have to be yourself and let other people accept you on your terms. Lots of people will not like you because they are assholes and you shouldn't worry about those people. Focus your time on a handful of people that seem to care about you at school instead of focusing on a lot of people that don't care about you. I know it's hard but you can do it.

He has depression and has been having a really rough time the last few weeks, the lowest I've ever seen him since meeting him (note: he is not self harming or a suicide risk but is feeling incredibly low to say the least). I have never dated anyone who battles depression and I just want to know for those who do, what is something a partner can do to help or support you?

"Not really because I'm not happy being this way. It's just, I'm from a small town, so everyone knows me, and they're all so religious. My own grandpa hasn't seen me in 3 years because of it, and we live in the same town. Some places won't hire me simply because of it, but they put it off as ""sorry we aren't hiring right now."" And then they go and hire someone else I know within days. I cant find a job for the life of me and I cant afford to leave. I'm just stuck and I'm almost out of options. I'm going to be homeless here soon l, and im not ready to be homeless again. I'm afraid I'm going to end up committing suicide because I have a family here to take care of and im letting them down because my depression and anxiety are so damn crippling. I've got severe anxiety, and bipolar 2 disorder, along with adhd that destroys any clear thinking. So im struggling to dig myself out of this. 
Just needed to rant before I go insane. Maybe this is part of why suicide rates in trans are so high. At least for me, I don't feel safe here. I was diagnosed before all of the transition. I thought this would help, but all ive done is ruin my life trying to be comfortable in my own skin and feel like me. I apologize for the long post, i don't really have anyone to outlet this to.

UPDATE; Rents due this week, and my girlfriend can't pay it on her own. Most likely won't have my own place for long, so finding a job was pointless because now I'm going to be homeless. Thank you all for the kindness. I just give up at this point. 😔

"I'm so very sorry to hear you're struggling like this. People really do suck hard, especially religious jingoists. I have a trans half brother myself. He's lucky in that he has a supportive mother and good friends, but he suffers a ton of micro transgressions, hate, or even straight up threats. It *absolutely* contributes to the high mortality rate of trans folk, whether deadly hate crimes or substance abuse and suicide.

Especially since they don't seem to be doing anything to support you. What part of the country are you in? I may be able to find resources nearby, like a LGBTQ shelter or something. If you're under a certain age, you might be able to get resources for the youth in our near your area. Are you afab or amab? You might also be able to qualify for women's resources depending on which one you are/pass for. These places are generally safe, but it might come to pretending or hiding your gender expression just to talk to certain people along the way. It's not right, but it's safer. I can help you navigate those situations/resources. Please keep me updated, if you wouldn't mind.

Do you feel comfortable in your own skin now?

Do you feel better now that you have changed physically and biologically?

I’m not sure what it’s called or if anyone has the same thing. So I figured I would make my first Reddit post hoping someone could help. But I have a thing where my body just disappears it’s like I can still feel things physically but everything is gone. I just feel like I’m numb. It freaks me out it happens all the time even if I don’t have any kind of anxiety/stress. It’s like a light switch that just flips. I recently figured out a way to kinda explain it. It’s like being in first person (just see stuff normal) then I’ll switch to 3rd person like I see everything around me. I hope that makes sense 🥺. Idk if it’s depersonalization or something else. When I try to google it comes up with depersonalization but I don’t feel like it explains how I feel. I feel like I turn into a ghost. I don’t know why it switches when I’m not worried about anything. I’ll just be watching tv and then it switches. When I’m not focused on it will switch back to being normal. It’s just kinda hard not to hyper focus on something that you feel. It’s an awful feeling especially since it happens all thru out the day. I think if I knew what it was and that other people have this also it would make me feel better about it. It’s kinda scary to have something wrong and have no idea what it is. 😩	killerkharma	post	18.841750164665108	male	White	0.9988038539886475	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
"Check this out ([What is Awakening](https://abhayakara.fugue.com/blog/2019/6/2/what-is-awakening)):

“
Another way this can be experienced is in non-identification: there just isn’t a feeling of identification.  This should not be confused with depersonalization. Depersonalization is a state of rejection: that is not me.  We normally tend to feel this way about things that aren’t our own body, so it’s a feeling with which most people are familiar, but depersonalization directs that same attitude toward the body and mind as well.

Non-identification, by contrast, is not a strong feeling that “I am not that,”, but rather the simple lack of a feeling that “I am that.”   This state is also probably familiar to you, because whenever you’re really deeply engaged in a task, there’s a tendency for the feeling of “me” to fall away.   A person who experiences non-identification is just in that state all the time.   You still interact perfectly normally with others.   One thing that can be quite nice about this state is that it’s possible to listen without needing to be someone.   So there’s no narrative going on as you are listening to the other person.   You are simply present, and you are hearing what they are saying.

"Since college I didn't really bother on making friends - in my mind the thought process has constantly been ""What do I stand to gain from being their friend?"", ""Is this time investment worth it?""

Basically whether I stood to gain any advantage in future i.e. like a job referral, LoR, etc

As such, I can confidently say, I only have 1 genuine friend so far and the sole person who has been in touch with me for past 8 years (since pre-college days when I did not have this line of thought)

Anything I plan to do, I keep thinking of it's pros and cons which can be detrimental at times

It's also why I focused solely at my job since the past 3 years since it only had pros and no cons

Now, I am slowly working on those issues, it's difficult to change the mentality quickly so I instead think of ""I stand to gain improvements on my social skills if I be their friend"", ""I could improve other aspects of myself if I be their friend"", ""Experience gained would be helpful when I go abroad"", ""Communicating with them could prepare me for handling certain situations/scenarios  - since my motto has been 'be prepared'""

I'm looking forward to the day that I stop thinking this way

"Something I didn’t learn quite as early as I wish I had.. Being social in college or in life isn't just about gaining advantages, it's also about learning to navigate different personalities and situations, which is a valuable life skill. Plus, it can lead to experiences that enrich your life that you never saw coming. 

The connections you do make may not feel like they matter right away, but the world is a relatively small place. Unless you move across the world and get a new name you’ll likely to run into at least a few people from your past well into your years.

"This was really interesting to read. I think there is ""something to be gained"" from everyone. I tend not to start as many friendships because of years of people-pleasing that I'm un-learning and right now it's just easier for me to keep my distance than to spend energy on holding boundaries when people want more from me than I am willing to give / have available. 

I wonder if you could try approaching relationships in a different way. By not attaching to the pros and cons thoughts and instead, consciously asking yourself how you felt from the interaction - did you feel like you wanted to talk or share or did you start looking for excuses to bail out of the conversation. I've started paying much more attention to how I feel in someone's presence to determine whether or not I'm willing to put any energy into a relationship or even a conversation. It makes a big difference over my old ways of thinking I had to be liked by everyone, maybe it could help you overcome your roadblocks around friendships too."	kyolichtz	reply	na	na	na	0.9884548187255859	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealth

So ever since I was a kind I have experienced instances where I’ve had a sudden overwhelming “bad feeling” that I can best describe as a feeling of dread/sense of doom. It’s intense and I just need to wait it out. It often happens in situations when my skin that is usually covered is exposed or when I feel cold water/fingers on my stomach or chest (so going into a body of water almost always triggers it) but it’s happened in other situations too. I have absolutely no idea what causes it. Has anyone else experienced this? Also, I sometimes experience intense feelings of disgust that can often last a few days where I feel disgusting ( that I am disgusting and my body is disgusting but also just a feeling of overall disgust and being nauseated by food and other things. This is part has to do with my bad body image). I wonder if anyone else relates to this experience as well."

"An intense feeling of doom - that is how people often describe panic attack.   
  
Although panic disorder can be very troublesome, it responds to treatment. Some people get over it quickly.  
  
Panic attacks can happen with no apparent trigger, but people can develop a phobia about a particular situation and the situation will trigger an attack. Let's say someone has a panic while playing the piano. The person associates the piano with panic, so the piano becomes a feared object.  
  
Panic disorder often responds to self-help. In fact, Handbook of Self-Help Therapies, which reviews studies of books and programs, says that of all the disorders, panic disorder is the one that’s most responsive to self-help.   
  
I heard someone say that although slow breathing is good for moments of panic, the attacks keep coming back. So, it looks like cognitive therapy is also helpful. Cognitive therapy for panic disorder involves understanding what the attack is. The symptoms are nothing but your system's natural responses to whatever seems threatening. You shouldn't get upset about them. You don't worry about fast heartbeat when you run, and there's no reason to fear it with a panic attack. Source - When Panic Attacks by Dr. David Burns.  
  
Dr. Burns is the author recommended most often by mental health professionals, according to Authoritative Guide to Self-Help Resources in Mental Health.  
  
  
You can't go wrong with stress management. It's something we all need. This could help you with your problem.  
  
Psychology Today online says that Dr. Dave Carbonell is a clinical psychologist who specializes in treating fears and phobias and the author of three self-help books, including Panic Attacks Workbook.  
  
In this video, Dr. Carbonell demonstrates a breathing exercise that he says is helpful for panic attacks.  
  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRIV2R3jzaQ&t=49s  
  
  
  
One of the best treatments is time. You know the old saying ""Familiarity breeds contempt."" After a while, the attacks are seen as a nuisance instead of a threat. Then the attacks become less frequent and finally go away altogether.  
  
I’ll tell you about two other things that you probably won’t need. It’s good to know they’re there if you need them.  
  
A study by a researcher named Meuret at Southern Methodist University showed that a biofeedback method called CART that reinforces slow, shallow breathing was effective. Slow breathing is often recommended, but deep breathing tends to promote hyperventilation, making it hard for people to breathe. Many people use slow breathing self-help successfully.  
  
There's a treatment called interoceptive exposure therapy. It's teaching people not to fear the symptoms of the panic attack by deliberately bringing on the symptoms - for example by bringing on a fast heartbeat by aerobic exercise."

About a year ago I moved out of my parents home. Which was an extremely abusive situation my entire upbringing. I am visiting for the week. I had been doing very good mentally before coming. After I got here a situation happened that caused me to snap mentally in a way. I had a mental breakdown, sobbing, punching the ground, shaking, my head became so foggy and fuzzy and after this is what was told to me by my boyfriend since I have no memory of anything after this point. I started rocking and having a blank stare. I began stuttering badly (I don’t stutter normally) and saying I don’t understand how I got here and questioning why I was at my parents house and why I looked different than normal? I seemed to not react as much to him speaking to me and mostly stared around the room confused. After some time he began asking me questions like what my name was and what was going on. And after some more rocking I instantly stopped crying. This is where my memory comes back, I found myself my the toilet on the floor and didn’t know how I got there. I didn’t understand why I was crying and stopped suddenly and didn’t remember why I was upset in the first place, I got up and went on with my night. I know this is long, I apologize. But I want to know what was going on"	Tommi_is_incoherent_	post	11.513523076551706	female	White	0.9970914125442505	na	na	na	3	MentalHealth
I think this is a pretty important thing you should look into. I don't have the answers but you should probably talk to a therapist or psychologist about this. I have a lot of issues with my memory as well. It's really great to have a counselor there to bounce things off of if you're having trouble knowing what really happened. I'm sure it can be very scary to have blank spots in your memory and there are probably ways to reduce the chance of it happening. However when it does happen it's also good to have a plan with your family and therapist.	Tommi_is_incoherent_	reply	na	na	na	0.9970914125442505	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealth

"The void hears you...

Sadly the limits of what you can do is support by being there, and not letting her push you away. There is a limit to how much you should stand, but flight behavior is common for people with trauma. They see good things and comforting things as dangerous because of the amount of hurt they can inflict. Which is why they often have many bad and abusive relationships, because it will hurt but not really hurt. They expect it, that expectation is comforting. 

Be consistent, listen, and communicate. Follow this and then the ball is in her court. Be content with the knowledge that you are doing what you can. Do not attempt to mind read her actions and behaviors however. That is a bad habit to get into, and leads others into the expectation you will do it all the time. That way leads to madness."

I have a friend (online only) who has been depressed for a while now, and along with that they’ve told me about things like anger issues and hallucinations (I won’t go into further details here) and those are of course concerning me significantly. I’ve tried to help as much as I can but being online only, and them living in a completely different part of the world limits what I can do by a lot. And along with that, I’m definitely not a doctor.

The world is a place made up of impressions, perceptions, and hard reality. The most you can do for a friend, especially online, is just let them know you are there. Communicate with them and expect them to do the same. Do not seek deeper meanings to things they say. We can only react to the things that are presented to us.

Mental health begins with the person who is at the center of it. Those around them can only orbit and be around to help when they need it. Part of growth is realizing that ""you"" are able to change and a source of your own problems.

"The void hears you...

We all learn what is normal as we grow up, and when that environment changes we start by getting nervous and then scared. If you grew up facing struggles, fighting, and scrapping by. Then peace and no resistance can be unsettling. It is a similar concept to veterans returning from war. We become addicted to the anxiety, the adrenaline, and the stress. 

Change needs a bridge to cross smoothly. This is why smokers need to slowly cut back or use replacement therapy. Some will choose high stress sports or risky friends to grant them the chaos or levels they need. Some begin meditation and affirmations to slowly normalize their new reality. Ideally we recommend the last of course.

Stress and risk being intentional can be problematic in the long run, and doesn't help with the change since it can often backlash. But it is your choice, and the void will always listen."	pinguins_8632	reply	na	na	na	0.003416242776438594	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealth

"Hey...shit news for you buddy...why do you feel like this?...Well its totally normal, you have been deceived, lied to so many times.

In order for this to have been kept secret from you, you have been lied to so many times that if you knew you more than likely could not keep up counting.

This is why you feel like this pure and and simple.  

Now regardless of this it is you and your thinking that will determine how you look back on this. If you choose to wallow in self pity and a woe is me attitude how will you move on? Do you want to feel like shit forever more?, feel hard done by? If you do, carry on doing what you are doing and thats how you will feel.

Now.... take some time, feel the loss, hurt and pain, its perfectly natural. 

Take a week and go over all of this, write it all down, write down every thought, feeling good or bad and just put in down on paper.

After a week re-read all once then take it outside and burn it.

This relationship is over, treat it as such and move on, go out party, enjoy what you do, don't do it to get back at her, treat this all as part of life.

More shit will come in life...thats a guarantee, people will shit on you, people will lie and decieve you, sometimes you will find out but many, many times you will never find out.

The only thing you can do is control how you feel and react to the 100's or many thousand times you will be decieved, lied to, fucked over in your future.

You cannot control others and their actions, just your own.

Someone once gave me a present and it was one word, no more information and that word was 'stoicism'.

"There is a saying ""there is always a better fish in sea than that one"".

Sorry to hear about that bro, here is the up and downs.

Downside is, yeah, you felt the world is crushing on you no matter what right or wrong you did.

Upside is, now she cheated on you, what is the next best thing to do. You have to keep moving forward. Considering your age, you got a LONG way to go.

Relax, take this a life lesson of what not to do for your upcoming relationship, just don't take negativity to the point it ruins your life.

Personally speaking, i am now in my 30's (no joke), still single, i mean, yeah sure, ""when are you going to settle down"" will appear in everyone's mouth the moment they see you.

I was also in a relationship, twice, but both went down the drain.

The first one i meet was through the standard ""whatsapp chat then lets meet-up sort of tactic and recommended by their family. It worked till i found out their family had some 'problems' that is too hard even for me to comprehend. So i stop 'whatsapp'ing her after that

The second one was slightly longer but strictly on whatsapp only, but with a catch, recommended by parents not to mention 'over-the-seas', ugh. It worked till she just stop replying me on whatsapp. I just gave up 

So that was, i felt kinda discouraged till today regarding with what i went through so far, but i told myself, just keep moving forward, and live your life. It is not the end yet.

You need to take to recover, sure, take your time, but don't forget, it is not gonna stop for anyone.

Another one was recent, I was applying for a important job I rly wanted to do + it had benefits and all. I failed so I took like 3 mg of Alprazolam to feel happy and don't care it kinda worked for a few hours
... I am also using SSRI's which generally made my anxiety less, and my mood much better (i haven't had depression just social anxiety)

Now its like 2 days from that failure day I had used the Alprazolam and I still feel kinda not excited. Not happy. More like slightly sad. Apathethic. I also feel kinda more ""stupid"" or like having a brain fog... I hope this ain't permanent.

Im more worried about getting a job even. I just feel like shit bcs 1. I keep failing at stuff and being unlucky a lot. And 2. I took xanax and now the after effects are emotion suppression which is rly true, making me only slightly happy or more so slightly sad. Lazy. Unmotivated to do much.

If thats not enough my psychologist I visited only once, wrote me that she cancels the upcoming appointment and will have to majorly limit her practice because of family injury which I understand but still... I would need some psychology help ASAP. Now i just want support is all I want....."	plshelpmeh284	post	21.213218235922977	male	White	0.9985390901565552	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
"There are things you can do on your own for anxiety and I'm happy to share them with you, but first I really have to say that it's a terrible idea to take a drug like Alprazolam or Xanax except as prescribed.  
  
Those ""benzo"" drugs have limited usefulness, and they can be very addictive.   
  
Most people with anxiety disorders do better with therapy (CBT) than with medication.  
  
Although self-help based on CBT has not been shown to be as effective as the standard treatments for anxiety with office visits, some people benefit from it. Authoritative Guide to Self-Help Resources in Mental Health, a book based on polls of more than 3,000 professionals, says that The Feeling Good Handbook by Dr. David Burns, a psychiatrist and cognitive therapy expert, is the one recommended most often by professionals.   
  
In recent years, there has been very encouraging evidence for therapeutic breathing, which can be combined with cognitive therapy methods for dealing with worrisome thoughts.  
  
When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.  
  
One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.  
  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.  
  
Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
Also, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.  
  
The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication.  
  
Don't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety.  
  
Video - a lot of helpful information, including the 3-part program of Brown and Gerbarg -

"A few days ago, I was living with two roommates. Suddenly, they decided to shift to a different place, and I had no idea about their plan until the day before they were moving. I feel hurt and confused as to why I wasn't included or informed. Now, I don't want to see their faces, but unfortunately, I can't avoid them because we're in the same class and group project.

On top of that, I used to have a best friend who cared a lot about me. However, over time, our contact diminished, and now we hardly talk unless it's related to work, even when we're in the same room. Recently, I went through something difficult and ended up crying, so I reached out to him for support. Now, I regret being vulnerable in front of him.

I'm feeling a mix of emotions and could use some advice on how to handle these situations. Any suggestions on how to cope with these circumstances and improve my overall well-being would be greatly appreciated."

"So I struggle with women due to my social skills and im not that outgoing but Im very sexually fustraited. I've never even seen a pair of tits in real life (only in porn or pictures), I've never kissed a woman or had sex before.

I was on holiday with a few friends and when I would go home from the club id see other men bringing back girls to thier appartments and deep down it would make me fucking angry, I remember walking home once hearing this guy say ""sorry lads shes with me tonight"" and I wanted to beat the fuck out of him. I've even heard 18 year olds talk about sex while im 25 and have never even seen a pair of tits with my own eyes.

Im tall, athletic, I try everything to make myself attractive and work my ass off at my job but I feel like im slowly turning into an incel. I keep this side hidden from me and I dont give off vibes but deep down I feel this way. My brother talks about girls he has sex with and although I love my brother but also have a hatred towards hik because he's getting pussy while I aint, my brother is also a waster while im very driven with my shit together

I dont even want to give a relationship to a woman who has slept with guys casually until I start sleeping with a few girls casually. I would date a virgin as im a virgin but I would feel very jealous over being with a girl who has had hookups while I aint.

I keep these feelings hidden because if I said this shit to anyone then it will be ""fuck off you incel, you hate women"". Then if I do pay an escort women would judge me for it while its ok for women to go around getting hookups because sex is easy for them to get, If your a woman who says ""my past shouldnt matter"" and then you say ""But I wouldnt date a man who has paid for sex"" then you are a hypocrite!"

The anger and resentment is your biggest enemy, more so as time moves on.  Those feelings are what turn potential incels into self fulfilling prophecies.  The anger and frustration will start manifesting in every interaction you have, and people can sense it and will be repelled.  If you want things to change, you’re going to have to start realizing these feelings as your biggest problem.  Even if it doesn’t seem fair, you have to treat it this way.  Your real enemy are not other men who are having sex, or women who don’t seem interested in you.  Your real enemy is in you.  It’s those feelings of frustration and anger.  You’re going to have to change your perception so that the only real failure is giving into those feelings.  You may have sensed by now that the biggest indicator of male success with women isn’t looks or even money.  Looks and money can get you cheap, unfulfilling victories if you have them in spades, but what will really make you successful or fail is your attitude.  When you are frustrated, pent up, stressed out, resentful, or agitated, people can sense that, and they don’t want to be around it.  It may be hard to accept, but there isn’t anything worthwhile you can do about this problem externally.  Some frustrated men think they can just make enough money and the problem will go away, but that’s not how it works.  The type of person you attract with money alone is not someone you can have a fulfilling relationship with.  You’re going to have to look inward, and start paying attention to the way you feel and behave, and question everything.  Why am I doing this?  Why did this make me angry?  What were the effects of me getting angry?  At the end of the day, most people just want to be treated as humans.  When you fetishize/idolize someone as a sort of prize to be obtained, you are thinking of them as an object.  Here is an example of an ideal alternative state to thinking of people this way.  Stop caring about failure the way you do now.  Ideally, if you try to develop a relationship with someone and they don’t reciprocate, you just say fuck it.  Successful people tend to take failures rather lightly, and focus on using failure as a learning opportunity.  However, people who fixate on perceived sleights and injustices toward themselves, and indulge themselves in anger and feelings of unfairness and victimhood, tend to manifest and become victims themselves.  The frustration and feelings of victimhood with begin to feed off each other, and you will eventually go to far to easily return.  You’re going to have to find a way to take this stuff less seriously, to the point where when someone doesn’t reciprocate, you just smile and shrug it off.  Treat people with respect.  Don’t get mad at them for not being interested, instead focus on the thing you can control: yourself and your reactions.  Ultimately, you’re going to get old and die (hopefully with the old part).  Some people find out way too late that the casual sex, career success, and money are not really the things that matter in the end.  What matters is your relationships with people.  And if you treat people with respect, understanding, forgiveness, and kindness, you will be surrounded by loved ones when you need them the most.  Who cares if any of them are fucking you, you’re going to die some day and the thing people always end up regretting is a lack of human connection.  If you can become comfortable as you are, and are relaxed, and comforting to be around, the sex and romance will start falling into your lap, no pun intended.  Sex isn’t something you are entitled to or are being cheated out of.  It’s something extra you get for being likable.  Your life so far is what it is, you can’t change it.  Every second you spend thinking about how it’s unfair, or how the system is rigged and getting angry about it, is honestly the only real way you can fail in this regard.  It’s a paradox that you have to sort of stop caring in order to do better in this regard, but it’s true.  If someone doesn’t like you, it’s not a big deal.  Not if you’re comfortable with yourself and fulfilled in other parts of your life.  Treat people with respect and dignity, and don’t fault them if they get the wrong impression of you.  You are young and will have many other opportunities meeting people.  Get to know yourself and what makes you feel angry and why, and you can start to change things.  It sounds difficult, but if you look on the bright side, your mind is ultimately something you get to shape yourself, and that can be a good thing or a bad thing, you will decide.

I am doing fine but this situation gets me depressed: indeed invite me for Snapchat/ Facebook friends but the bond is forced; because, in real life show poor patience. Few times, some of these family members invited me for dinner at their house and ignored me the entire time. I was like a ghost eating their food, lookin into their eyes as they talked. They did not let me speak. Once when I tried to speak during a dinner day out at their house they would just ignore me straigh forward. I used to talk to them by Facebook but they still do not tell me when Someone dies (for instance) in order for me to attend the funeral; and other things. I stopped replying to my cousin Facebook messages. Every now and then this cousin asks me “how are you” by fb text and I have no special answer either because I am never told about anything important: some serious health surgeries/ issues are never spoke to me, either.	precisoresposta	post	30.32269611835336	male	White	0.999502420425415	na	na	na	3	MentalHealth

"My uncle has done similar things to my cousin because he thought she couldn’t “handle the truth”. She has had some mental health issues in the past and he was worried it would overwhelm her. Maybe that’s the same idea with you? 

Worst case scenario, you don’t just have the family you are born with, you have the family you build, and that includes friends, partners, pets. It sounds like you have reached out a lot to them. It’s up to you if you want to continue to do so, but you can also start investing time and energy into people who reach out to you and want to keep up with your life. 

If you are not emotionally burned out you can try sitting down with your family and saying how you feel. That it is painful that they don’t tell you what is going on, that you feel the conversations are superficial and that it hurts your feelings that people ignore you when you try to speak with them. Hopefully hearing how their actions impact you will make them want to change to be more open and inclusive with what is going on. But if they try to guilt you for feeling upset or come up with excuses, unfortunately you have your answer and it is that they aren’t going to change. It’s up to you to decide what you want to do with that information; if you want to keep trying to reach out to them, wait for them to include you better, or to walk away from the situation.

"Hi, this is a pretty hard fear to explain, but I’ll try my best. This has recently sent me down a spiral of depression, which is rare for me. Even the thought of it makes me want to breakdown into pieces.  


Is the world truly just a bad place?  


I live in a verbally abusive household, with a narcissistic, very mentally ill father and a cheating mother. After we found out about my mothers affair, my father has been really into ‘psychology’ and manipulation. Now trust me, I really enjoyed psychology as an idea before my dad started talking about it. He’s forcing me to learn it now, saying that if I don’t know these ‘psychology hacks’ that i’ll end up weak and a loser and my future bf will cheat on me, my friends will leave, and I’ll be a poor unsuccessful person.  


I don’t like the idea of manipulating people, and becoming one of those business people who only care about money and how to get to it. For me, I’m down to earth, I love nature, want to follow my dreams, and care about being a good person. But for my dad, being a good person will get you no where and I have to be ‘smarter’.  


And I am so afraid that he is right.  


Everywhere I go on social media I see stories of people getting cheated on, getting n\*des leaked, how love is fake, how friends betrayed them, how you can manipulate a guy/girl to fall in love with you and I’m so damn tired of it. Is this really the world? Is it just a big ‘game’ where whoever is the most cunning will win? Am I forced to live like this?  


From my past traumas, I have serious trust issues. And being a hopeless romantic, all of this information has been a heavy hit on me. I just want real love, is my dad telling me that if I don't manipulate people, nobody will ever love me? I recently suspected that I may have a crush on one of my classmates, but instead of being happy with this feeling - I started thinking far ahead and fearing that if we ever dated I’d just get my heart broken.  


I can’t even look at people without thinking they’re out to get me and/or everyone is using manipulation/psychology to get their ways. Can anyone help? I’m sorry if this is a pretty complicated rant."	Queasy-Emphasis9092	post	18.133256361598015	male	White	0.9973804354667664	na	na	na	2	MentalHealth

"I often talk about a book that has been a best-seller for generations, How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie. Businesses often recommend it to their employees. People in sales say that it's an invaluable resource.

The best salesman, says Carnegie, is an honest one. A salesman who thinks he's clever will try to divert the customer's attention to the most expensive thing, but a successful salesman wants to know the wants and needs of the customer, treats the customer as an individual.

Building a good rapport with customers means more business from them.  It pays to remember what the customer likes, and personal information, things like what the customer does for a living, the Little League baseball team the customer's child belongs to, etc.

It pays to be friendly, to smile.

If you want to call that ""manipulation"" OK, but it's good for everybody concerned.

The key to making friends and keeping them is **sincerity**.

Flattery will get you nowhere but a sincere compliment now and then can work wonders, especially when somebody is feeling down.

Be seriously interested in what the other guy says. Above all, be a good listener.

parents split up when I was 13, lived with my dad who is always nice to me, lived with him for first few years as my mum cheated on him which I didn’t respect at all, then I decided to live more with my mother when I turned 16 as a lot of my work and friends were in that area that she was living in, and well as that I’ve 2 younger brothers that lived with her so I wanted to be around them as well, they would of been a lot younger than me so I would act as a father to them basically, 

well up until 4 weeks ago I’ve been living with my mother since, but she is a narcissist and I’ve put up with so much verbal and mental abuse over the years I’ve acctually become numb to it, she kicked me out of the house over an argument about not paying rent for a week when she was away abroad with her current boyfriend ( the same one that she cheated on dad with) and I was paying for myself basically ,food electricity, etc

Well fast forward to the present and I’m now living with dad (45) and his girlfriend of 6 years (30), now my dad is lovely to me but his girlfriend steps over the boundaries way too much especially around my younger brothers basically having no patience with them and me and acting as our mother which she is not! I’m disappointed in dad as he just takes the backseat now and basically lets her parent which is messed up in my eyes, I’ve so much anger and frustration inside me that I’m scared I’m gonna flip out sometime and tell them really how I think of them.. oh yeah I hate her btw

"It's always hard to make other people change, it's a path to frustration and anger. 

Forgiveness on one hand, especially with your parents. It's for yourself, not for their benefit. Make it happen inside of you. Repeat it when the anger comes up. It will make it much easier for you to deal with the situations when they happen. Numbness is a way to cope with it but it's still there and it will show up. 

Express responsibility for yourself. From small to big situations and decisions. Express patience with her. Set boundaries and find ways to express them. Shouting at someone can sometimes help to get things moving but most times it's a short lived relief.

Hi this is a long one, basically I think my partner is having a psychotic episode. Or maybe she is going to kill herself and the drugs are keeping her alive. Based on her multiple different reactions to me when I found her drugs. 

My partner was really successful top of her game intelligent hard working driven and inspiring. We got together and really I just knew I was punching but she seemed to like me and I did my best. We never fought we always found a way to listen to eachother's needs. We moved in together things just got better we loved eachother and would do our best for eachother she would listen to my trivial BS and make things better and I would try and do the same for her. I'd make her breakfast and by her flowers or some nice bit of Tec I'd researched. Then COVID happened we worked through it but honestly we struggled a bit with rent because we couldn't fill the. Spare rooms. In the house but we were both earning good many and we had loads of savings I didn't worry too much about it at the time. 

Then we got pregnant... Wasn't such a big deal we have 9 months to figure this out! But

to be honest I'm really excited.. I've always wanted a family I mean I love mine and I always wanted the same. She worked up until she took maternity, she managed to do a good job handing over all her projects into the not so capable hands of her MD. 


So my partner took maternity leave and I go about attempting to secure myself extra work and more hours in attempt to cover the excess costs. It took me a while to secure consistent work, there was a mini attempt by my coworkers to take my job when I took three or four weeks off to help with my partners recovery after child birth. I pushed myself back in and everyone eventually backed off. But we we're doing ok again.


My partner comes back from maternity... So my partner comes back from maternity but I don't think her company is ready for her to come back. So they had a new project manager cover her position while she was gone they got this guy in basically as cover and gave him all of her projects. Which is fine but when she came back all her projects weren't her projects anymore they were this other PMs on to of this they didn't have enough work for her so they tried to get her to take a reduced role with reduced hours... This was where is all started to go wrong. Because straight off the bat she started to try harder to battle back for her position she obviously didn't take the reduction in hours that all the women who had babies in that company had previously taken. Along with their reduced roles as essentially assistants to the new male project managers who won't take maternity. Anyway, long story short they had put too much on the new PM they expect him to be able to do his job but didn't think they needed to check in on him at all to see if he was actually doing it. They eventually gave my partner some of her old jobs back but the ones that were furthest away from home and the ones that had fallen into complete crap. So she went about putting all these right and finding other projects to keep her Carrer ticking over, She wanted her main project back but the new PM wanted to keep that and the MD wasn't going to do anything to upset his new star. 6 weeks later the star hands in his notice all of a sudden the MD needs her to do all of her old projects and as well as her new ones. The takes on some of them but not the main project because it required full time managing and she was already overworked at this point. This was reasonable I think but she was at this point already way too big for her boots so she wasn't about to say no in my opinion. I think anyone else they would have respected that position and worked around it which did happen next with the new new project manager. So a new project manager came in and took over the main project and instantly pulled out of it. It was one of the premier contracts in the country so you would think it was worth fighting for but nope.. and of course this decision was respected and supported. But of course my partner got the blame for not re inheriting the project she wasn't allowed back when she could justify the workload, even though she hadn't stepped foot on site for over a year and is now only considered an 'assistant'. 

By this time I was completely burt out I had reached my quota work wise but was powering through. My partner was fighting tooth and nail to get her old team back but they were being used on the new new project managers sites. So she sent an email out asking if he could start building his own team going forward as she needs them to bring another sizable project to completion. A project she had programed and priced accordingly. He too offensive to this and went to her line manager and the MD the line manager took over her role when she decided she wanted to project manage another prestigious major project she had tendered for and won. So basically not exactly adept at managing teams of people. They called her in for an appraisal and basically gave her a dressing down and demanded an apology from her.. that was it.. they broke her. She battled on but essentially everything she had worked for was being eroded away. She started to descend into depression and this was taking a role on me also. I was burning out. I could see us both being jobless very soon. So I took our little one out of nursery which was costing nearly 2000 a month and tried my best to manage costs so so we could survive. I was rite and she couldn't work anymore she was crippled with anxiety and she couldn't face the battles anymore. And I was having to take more and more time off work to support her. This was the beginning of the end of my position also I was pushed out of work the vultures swooped in and picked at my carous I had a good run but my carrier was definitely cut short I was building towards something great but such is life. 

Anyway, she had a proper psychological break. She was gone for a good two weeks she couldn't get out of bed the doctor gave her some medication but it did nothing but make her sleep all day. She eventually started researching workers rights and started to find out she had been treated inappropriately to the point where she was legally entitled to take them to the cleaners. But she wasn't interested in doing that. She wanted them to understand what they had done but they used her nature against her they saw the weaknesses and exploited it. They got a female HR person in to chat with her and they all finally agreed to pay her off and had her sign any future lawsuit away. 


With that out of the way I thought we would draw a line under it all. I wasn't working very much at this point but still pulling in some money I was looking after our kid and I was letting out a room that was essentially more than covering our rent. So we were fine financially. My partner got a new job almost straight away but I know now how and why. She most likely started doing gear to drag herself out of this depression and was all of a sudden able to make things happen just about. So her new job she was something she would have in any ordinary circumstances excelled at. But she was erratic and knee jurk. It put everyone on edge. If she wasn't on drugs she was imbalanced. She didn't last past her 3 month probation. This is when I found loads of gear in the house. She had been taking it all the time. I didn't know how I was going to address it but I was going to have to. I was hoping she was just using it to get out of her depression and that she would just stop but she was pushing me really hard to get a job. I realise now it's because drugs are expensive and because I didn't have a full-time job I wasn't buying everything, so she was expected to now. But she didn't have the money because she was spending all her income and all the household income on gear. She was also very jealous of me hanging out with my daughter apparently (who knows she didn't seem to care what I wanted) she was driving it home really hard that she wanted to put the little one back in nursery. Anyway she took it upon herself to just enroll her again. When this happened I instantly went back to work my partner last her the little one has been back in nursery for 6 or 7 months now. My partner has been out of work about the same amount of time. Now she is cycling between her and crazy. Right now she is crazy she hasn't slept for 6 days yesterday she was just relentless she wouldn't stop coming at me with these impossible positions that she need me to agree with. She thinks I'm controlling and now that I'm trying to get everyone on side but I'm genuinely just concerned for her and our child. I've seen her cycle through this behaviour for a few months now this is the worst I've seen her I know she will crash eventually I'm just wondering is it appropriate to call a doctor on her when she finally comes down she needs professional help I only involved one other person about this whole situation which happens to be her best friend who I know she respects I was hoping that they could get through to her but she sees it like I'm a splinter cell infiltrating the illusion she has created for herself. So now because she is having interviews and potentially getting some new jobs it's confirming to herself that what she is doing it correctly. But this illustration that it is not obvious that she is on something is delusional. Some people read it as anxiety other read it as drugs. My sister was over to visit for a couple days and picked straight up on it. I hadn't said a thing to her because I don't want my family to know what she been up to they will not be as understanding as me. My mom has already lost a load of respect for her because of a provis incident she's probably pretty upset with me right now I have spoken to her in months. It's hard to tell her I'm ok when I'm not.. even typing this that's absolutely kills me. I know there is something I need to do but I don't know what it is. Should I call the police?  Have her commited? Tell her mom? Take my child away? I hate living like this she's currently babbling to herself in the toilet with her bag when she has her drugs ""hidden"" in her grandmother Russian doll it's just so pathetically unoriginal it infuriates me how average it is. Life is difficult that's why it's depressing she's just copped out now but I don't have that choice. I have to stay sane for my daughter I don't know how much more I can take of this though and it's scaring me."	robocoprobochicken	post	32.626583935648924	female	White	0.00426919711753726	na	na	na	2	MentalHealth
I myself.... had this issue- I ended up finding an ER ... AND THEY got me into crisis unit (that was free). I don't have a drug problem- but people at the crisis unit I was with did - they were able to be prescribed narcan or however it's spelled for their drug problem. The units are usually an in person stay.... then they refer you to an intake process and psych eval to get the help needed.

I applaud you for putting up with this for as long as you have. I can tell how much you love your family and have sacrificed so much for it all to work, but I think you know what the right thing to do is. However, I wouldn’t call the police. They are just going to see drugs in the picture and a child, and do the job they are trained to do which is not always in favor of situations that require more than just their due diligence. I think if I were you, I’d call for some professional advice from an institute that deals with drug abuse/stress or anxiety related issues and go from there.	robocoprobochicken	reply	na	na	na	0.00426919711753726	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealth

14 years old is way too young to write off someone's potential for recovery. It sounds like she is in an extremely difficult place but so much changes in the brain over the course of adolescence.

i don't know how to make sense of my thoughts and feelings anymore.

everything just feels like they're going on all at once and sometimes i can pretend to keep up but most of the time i am just floating by.

i don't feel like me anymore, or maybe i don't feel like me for a few months now.

i feel my emotions too much and process them too less. i feel then forget about them and it's been affecting my ability to focus at work, to be kind at others, to feel motivated and disciplined.

i just let things happen and it's like i don't care enough about the consequences. but i want to care, i want to get focused, i want to stop being late and procrastinating, i want to be kinder and nicer to people around me, i want to do things for myself. but i can't bring myself out of this ditch. whether it be the excuses that even i got tired of coming up with...or the extreme laziness. there's always something that would suddenly steal any kind of productive momentum i have.

it feels like i'm only fooling myself everytime i'd say tomorrow will be better. coz it's still the same. i still can't care enough to change. i feel hopeless.

when empathising with others. The way I see empathy is to put myself in their shoes. However now, if I were in their shoes during these small inconveniences or stressful times not relating to
death or disease, I would be laughing through it. If my friends are going through a seemingly difficult time, I still try to help them out, but in my head I just can't bring myself to care.

"Need advice for me and my wife.

Ok so I am married. I married my wife 6 months ago. She has 2 kids. I also have a mother and 2 sisters. My mother had a stroke in 2017 that had made her paralyzed on her left side. She is in a nursing home. I have been visiting her every week since that had allowed us to after Covid. My issue is that my wife think that I put my mom first before her that that I should be making a life with her and the kids. And I feel that I do. But I take 2 hours of my week to sit and talk to my mother. She enjoys that visits. One sister visits every few weeks. And my other visits every weekend because of the drive. My wife had a problem with when I went on sundays because we had to plan around it. So I agreed to change it to Fridays. Well that last a few months and she still doesn’t like it. She says that it’s hard to plan around it cause I had to be there. Now granted. If we plan for trips I go a day or 2 before. Just so I don’t miss a week. My question is. Is it wrong seeing my mom? Am

Your wife sounds horrible, I suggest you making it very  clear to her that you are not going to stop seeing your mother because it bothers her. You need to establish a clear boundary here that any talks regarding you abandoning your mother will not be tolerated or your wife will keep crossing those boundaries (I could bet that she is also trying to control other aspects of your life). Its even more disgusting that she is a mother herself, would she like her kids to abandon her too once she gets old?

You are not wrong and the fact that your wife thinks this is a problem is very alarming. Does she want your mom to sit alone in a nursing home forever? Would she be okay doing that to her parents? 2 hours a week is totally reasonable. It’s beyond reasonable. Are you allowed to do other things like go to the gym or is that wrong too because it’s an hour away from your family a few times a week?

I'n here since i've had some thoughts that have been bothering me. 
I see myself acting diffrent, to be someone the other person wouldn't easly get bored off, and how do i explain it, i know its wrong to catfish with ur personality but i have the urge to do it yet not do it. I see myself acting a bit coy or docile but when i actually feel into it and imagine myself as that i feel a sense of discomfort and disgust, im not sure if its because ive hardly even embraced my femeninity or if its because i find it hard to completely let down my guard when with a man(i see men as a diffrent species, not because i hate them ive just had a rough childhood with an alcoholic step dad and a few incidents with a step father) i find it hard to even befriend a guy. 
I wanna be able to date but i just cant seem to let my guard down, I feel like i would be taken advantage of or looked down upon as a weakling.

You need to apply and then explain at the medical that you were an immature twat as a teenager but you've now matured and realise the mistake you made as a child.

UK answer... What goal are your mental health records interfering with? It does make a difference.  You can't change what was written at the time, that you claimed to be suicidal,  as it's a true record of what you said at that point in time. You can, however, speak to your GP and request that a note is added to your medical records explaining why you said what you did and acknowledging that you were never suicidal. Not knowing your goal, it's hard to advise further.	DazzlingAd8374	reply	na	na	na	0.999177873134613	weak	no	strong	na	MentalHealth

"Pretty much my entire life I’ve felt “off” or different. I (32M) don’t know how else to describe it. Usually I just say “social anxiety” because that’s something that most people can understand, but it feels like so much more than that. I feel like I’m not really a part of life. It’s hard to explain, so I’ll try to stick to the facts:  
\* I’ve never been in a relationship of any sort. Wouldn’t know how to initiate one and certainly wouldn’t know how to participate in one (I’m filled with immense fear just thinking about it). I’ve never been intimate or physical with anyone.   
\* I don’t have friends. The last time I had friends was in university, more than 10 years ago. It didn’t end well. Even then, my friendships mostly felt superficial and they would always peter out over time. I never felt like I brought anything to friendships except the ability to make people laugh.  
\* I don’t have a job. I never have, really. I’ve done some freelance stuff in the past, but never enough to make a living out of it. I’m riddled with self-doubt and fear, which makes it difficult to apply for jobs (let alone interview for one). Even the simplest tasks cause me to second-guess myself over and over again until I either give up or force my way through it and make myself sick in the process.  
\* I live with my parents. Lately I’ve started to suspect that my dad may be on the autism spectrum. I’ve wondered that about myself for a while as well.  
\* I’m short-tempered and get stressed out/overwhelmed very easily.   
\* I’ve become incredibly regimented the past couple years. I do pretty much the same thing every single day. I eat the same things every day even. I guess it gives me a sense of control over my life.   
\* I often feel guilty or ashamed of being me.  
Sorry for rambling. I’m not sure what I’m hoping to get out of this. Maybe it just helps to write things out. For what it’s worth, I am in counselling, but resources are pretty limited where I live so it’s only once a month and barely scratches the surface of what’s going on inside my head.   
Anyway, thanks for reading.

"Have you taken any of the online RAADS tests? They’re supposed to be the sample tests for the autism spectrum. 

I’m 33F and have felt some of the things you have and have been doing a lot of research on ADHD and Autism and how they present. Being undiagnosed with either can also lead to heavy amounts of anxiety/depression. It’s definitely worth looking into. 

I, too, wonder about my own dad being on the spectrum (that or he’s truly just a narcissist) because from what I read it would be inherited from the paternal side. 

Do a little digging and if you have can afford to get an evaluation, it wouldn’t hurt.

I’ve suffered with mental health since I was 11 years old. I was self harming by the end of my 1st year in high school (age 12) by 13 I was trying to make my own life ect but I’ve always been rather troubled as I’ve had a horrific upbringing I was sexually abused as a child and went into care at 4 years old. I’ve always had inappropriate out bursts in public iam adhd and I’ve struggled to make friends but I described a very well liked little girl who had issues and another side to them I was extremely aggressive as a child too but not to other children. I was restrained by adults on a regular basis but my foster carers didn’t think about how all the trauma made me feel and thought I was a horrid kid but my mum did leave me at the reception desk at a hospital when I was 4 saying she couldn’t cope with me.

When I was 16 my mental health took a turn I stopped self harming but my outbursts got more inappropriate ANYTHING set me off it’s almost like I’m jekrell and Hyde I ended up been a victim of domestic abuse too and had two children who are only 11 months apart. I was 17 when I gave birth to my 1st but I often feel like I was beaten up due to my mood swings and hurtful comments when my bad side came out but my children’s father was very similar to me on mental health side of things the only difference was I’d never hit him 1st or hit him back I never laid hands on him but he hospitalised me I said the same hurtful things he said to me. So the verbal abuse was mutual but I would be very upset and very remorseful about what I said But every time I snap at anyone I’m  extremely remorseful and it hurts to see I’ve hurt someone’s feelings who I love but I switch like a light switch. Im extremely insecure too some months are worse than others. I’d go from feeling beautiful and making an effort I’ll post lots of photos on social media and then I’ll switch and hate myself for weeks and I’ll criticise myself to the point I go crazy and actually kick off and think I’m disgusting and won’t even go to the shop for essentials this is still the case to this day it’s effected me for years. I hate to admit this but I’ve got a huge fear of what everyone’s saying about me, I think my current partner is cheating on me when I go into a mood i think I’m not good enough and that he’s going to leave and this leads to me getting very upset, but I go from been the most loving and empathetic person who would do anything for people I  love to literally “go away I hate you and don’t need you” and say some of the most vile shit you’ve ever heard and in that moment I mean it . I end up crying the next day and call myself a monster for losing control with my words and then realise ive made my partner feel like crapand then I get suicidal and think the worlds better off without me ( I never mention my suicidal thoughts to my partner as I don’t want to look like an attention seeker) I keep what I can to myself . I have regular mood swings that are EXTREME but at least 2-3 times a day from been happy, sad, angry, loving and, psychotic. But some weeks/ months when I feel extremely on edge and energetic almost manic the mood swings are more intense the mood swings are always there but some months are so much more intense than others. I have gained some more symptoms since having children too (who were removed from my care for domestic abuse and of corse mental health issues) i now can’t leave the house I’m constantly thinking I’m very poorly and think I’m dying of a new illness and it causes intense breakdowns and sheer panic. Going out in public I feel embarrassed as I feel I’m been looked up and down from head to toe and that they know my kids were taken and that I’m just like my own mum. And I’m getting very slow cognitively 
 I forget what I’m saying mid conversation. People struggle to understand what I’m saying I’m jumbling words often misunderstand people and see the negative and think there degrading me.

It’s so confusing been called borderline personality disorder by my own mother and then bipolar by my current partner. Iam currently getting help but I’m on a mad long waiting list to see a psychologist and I’m so confused with what’s wrong with me I feel like I’m a horrible person and that I’m ruining everyone else but the rage built up in me isn’t normal I don’t even know my own triggers my thoughts are cloudy my brains foggy and I’m just overly fed up with life but I just want everyone to feel loved and happy by me I feel like locking myself away so I don’t hurt anyone 😕I’ve noticed I’m significantly worse in relationships but I don’t know if this is a fear of been emotionally hurt or because I went through extreme domestic abuse. But I don’t think my child hood has anything to do with this as my mum did struggle with me it’s like I was born this way. I don’t know who iam anymore."

It does sound like you probably have BPD caused by your traumatic childhood as well as health anxiety. I'm assuming you're here in the UK where mental health services are stretched so much that it's incredibly difficult for anyone to get treatment.  You do need the support of a community mental health team and DBT but it's up to your GP to refer you. In some areas you can self refer so it's worth googling the system in your area. If you're not in receipt of personal independence payments, it's definitely worth applying.  It's completely up to you what you do with the money but if you get help filling in the forms by the CAB you could be looking at an additional income of up to £691every 4 weeks even if you work or claim other benefits. You can spend the money on anything but I do recommend seeing a private psychiatrist for a diagnosis and medication to help you feel calmer as well as a private therapist that specialises in DBT. You can call your local mental health crisis team 24 hours a day to speak to a mental health professional, and if you ever feel unsafe you should go straight to A&E and they'll keep you safe until you're assessed by the crisis team in person. If you go to mind.org.uk you can find a good explanation of BPD and treatment options.	TheseAd8210	reply	na	na	na	0.9944326281547546	weak	no	strong	na	MentalHealth

"i want to emphasize that I am not suicidal, or in danger of self-harm or physical abuse. i marked this as NSFW just in case, since I can't really tell how sensitive my wording might be. 

i've just turned 40, and been diagnosed with anxiety/panic disorder at 14, depression at 16, OCD at 19-ish and late-diagnosed with ADHD in my mid-20ies. i've dealt with these on and off for most of my life, and usually i get by. i have no memories of any abuse in my childhood, but over the last 1, maybe 2 years, i've come to strongly suspect i'm showing signs of C-PTSD. i am not diagnosed for that, and, as i said, i have no memories of any type of abuse. Which is a bit of an empty statement, since I really have very, very few memories of my childhood and teen years in general. 

i've been in and out of therapy, mostly just seeing a therapist, but i've been in a hospital twice, for 3 and 4 months, respectively. 

what i want to ask your guys' opinions about, is my relationship and life plans. 

i am in a marriage with my wife (we're both women, she has asperger's autism, which she also only was officially diagnosed about a year and a half ago)

we've been together for \~10ish years now. we've started as friends, then roommates, then we moved apart again, and then moved into our current home and adopted 3 cats. neither of us wants kids.   
so, i am aware of her own troubles with her aspberger's, and that she's very sensitive about sounds and people (me) in her space. we've been planning to move to another city, for a couple reasons, and i do want to move there eventually. 

however, right now, i am so very happy at my work place, which i'd have to leave (the other city is over 2 hours drive away, so no possibilty to commute) . i love my job, i love my coworkers and my boss, i've been there for over 10 years, and while i've been open about out plans to move in the early next year, and my boss is understanding... i've started doubting my decision. 

i love my wife. in our own, weird, neurodivergent and asexual way, we've found each other and been through some crap together. Two years ago, i'd have moved without a second thought. Now, i have \*so many\* second thoughts. 

our dynamic has become... awkward. i don't want this to sound like she's a bad person, because she's not, i just need to vent and get this off my chest. I have no ""only me"" friends outside of my coworkers. (i have two friends which i met through my wife), so i have no place to get this off my chest at. 

she's become... unfairly harsh towards me, i feel. over the last two years, i've tried and given my best to make things easier on her developing symptoms (as in, the symptoms coming up as she learns to stop masking), i've stopped using the living room when she's around, and i've started using headphones instead of listening to anything on my laptop or tv. I've stopped suggesting movies or series to watch, since most of everything triggers her in some way, and i've stuck with watching stuff by myself or joining in with what she wants to watch. 

which, overall, wouldn't bother me so much, if she wasn't so... i don't know if ""condescending"" is the right word, but oftentimes the things i bring up, she brushes off as low-quality or low-brow-entertainment. which i won't deny, but i am easily amused and don't mind some slapstick skits or memes or ""funny noise humor"". i've adhd, i like the quick and simple things, i can't pick up on a youtube singer's below-average singing if i like the song, i just... like to like things. i'm a generally optimistic and happy person, i find joy in random nonsense, even if it's dumb or childish. 

and these last months, she's just... managed to make that go away in me. or made me feel self-conscious and dumb for it, and i can't tell her. 

which brings me to my biggest problem, i can't push back. i've never been a very firm person. i can't stand up for myself, i'm scared, sometimes \*terrified\* of conflict. i'm scared i'll lose her, or worse, make her yell or get angry at me.

a part of me thinks it's the RSD from my ADHD, another thinks it might be a ""fawning response"", since it's gotten worse and it's just strengthening my C-PTSD suspicions.

i just feel so lost for what i should do. i want to move with her (though we'd get separate appartments since she can't be with anyone in her space, which includes her home, even if she wants us to be next to each other) 

i want to stay here, because of my work and my colleagues and because i feel like she wouldn't be able to support me through the emotional part of having to find a new job and start all over again, possibly several times 

i also want to move with her, because i do love the city we'd move to, and i'd be closer to my parents, but... 

&#x200B;

i really am lost for what to do and where to even start. 

i'm ""stuck"" here until at least february, because i'm doing a work education thing (about trauma counselling, ironically enough... i'm a social worker and working in a nursery with kids with and without disabilities) so i have a few months to work myself out at least."	blackiedwaggie	post	27.638221894312103	male	White	0.002906863344833255	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth

"Hello all
So I (F22) just had a fight with my mom (F50) and she got angry and dramatic (in my opinion)

Usually after a heated discussion, I’m confident in what I said to explain my actions and stuff, but I still feel upset about her reaction, meaning if i was in her place I wouldn’t be THAT angry. 

So basically her reaction is disturbing me. I want to move on with my day but every time I try to distract myself with smth I’d still think about the situation. 

Am I not validating her feelings? I think she was dramatic and idk how to accept it and not let it disturb me. 

TL;DR: Regardless of the situation and how intense it was I don’t want to be affected and upset by people’s reactions.

"It’s possible you’re not validating her feelings, but at the very least, it sounds like you’re not validating yours.

Her reaction made you feel resentful and angry. And that’s normal. If you’re willing to process it, that emotion would tell you a lot and help guide you to communicate a boundary with her. 

Instead, it seems like you’re suppressing your resentment and just trying to “move on.”

But with emotions, the only way out is through. You need to spend time with your resentment and process through it. I read a newsletter on resentment a few months ago [here](https://us8.campaign-archive.com/?u=9aef9111fe420044bd58e57ea&id=96310e5eca) if it’s helpful."

A lot of people are talking about gaining contentment with mindfulness. Therapists are into this big time.  
  
Psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg, who have published 6 papers on breathing and mental health, recommend a 3-part program of mind-body methods - breathing, meditation, and slow body movement. Incorporate these into your daily life. Be aware of changes in mood and respond mindfully, aware of your breathing.   
  
Brown and Gerbarg says that 20 minutes of their breathing exercise is a treatment for anxiety.  
  
Calming down helps you to think your way through the thoughts that worry you. Think about the worst that can happen, how likely that is, and what you can do if it happens.

"How do I give myself a reason to live? I KNOW no one needs me, and my cat died last month; she was my only reason for living because she was the only living thing that actually needed me to live. My family moved a thousand miles away, I have very few friends.... they'd all be perfectly fine if I ceased to exist right this moment. They might be a little sad, but eventually they'd get over it and move on. Not to mention, I live alone, so no one would probably even know I was dead for several days. 

Literally the only reason I'm still here is because of my intense fear of failure. I don't want to try to off myself, only to fail and be a semi-sentient vegetable for the rest of my life.

The only issues is that I’ve felt this anger for about 2 years after she cut contact and it has prevented me from dating or connecting with anyone else emotionally.

Look at what you achieved without her. She lead you on and hurt you, as you said she doesn't deserve to be in your life.

Recgonize the anger and be careful how you present it. The emotion is not the problem it's how we display it. If you're achieving things with anger then I'm sure it's just a good motivator for you.

I have no idea why, but I have a feeling that I'm becoming dumber. This started a couple of years ago and it is starting to worry me.  I make unlogical descisions in the moment and am unable to explain my thought process later. This is tied to schoolwork mostly but not exclusevly. I am good at learning stuff but I can't seem to logically use the knoledge. For example when I was learning how to drive I learned the rules but was unable to recognise when I actually needed to apply them. I  Sometimes my brain just does weird things and I jump to conclusions WAY too quickly, but on the other hand sometimes I am not able to connect the dots. I also often mess up when I need to answer questions verbally. I study a subject but then when I am graded I realize that I had a totally wrong picture in my head! I don't know if maybe it is the problem that I study quietly (in my head) instead of repeating information out loud. I have social anxiety and I suspect that I may have autism but I'm not sure. My family is very introverted and we don't speak to one another often, I also mostly text with my friends (and I don't have that many tbh). Since i tend to stay quiet for longer periods of time I often feel like I'm going crazy and it's getting overwhelming to read/look at/listen to media and people while I myself don't participate (if that makes sense).

Dating someone with mental issues is extremely exhausting so people are bound to explode sometimes and say things they didn't mean. Give him a break and find other ways of coping with your issues.

I read your previous posts. No offense, but you 100% sound like a burden to your partners. Only you can change that by working on yourself, striving for evermore self-awareness. Get treatment for your BPD. Stay out of relationships until you're better functioning. I recommend you look into DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy) which was specifically created for individuals with BPD to cope, take things less personally, and learn to be more fair and reasonable to others. I took it myself years back when they diagnosed me, but me and my doctors are looking into it it's actually ADHD. Both suffer from extreme emotional dysregulation. Borderlines tend to have a much greater emotional dependence on others, though. You've got to train yourself to be alone and okay with it. As someone with BPD, you basically have to think about your emotional dependence on others as an addiction, because chemically, that's what it is. You need to learn how to be your own person without heavily leaning on others for support, entertainment, distraction, etc. Stop thinking about others for now. Just focus on your therapy and possibly seek some antidepressants, they do often still help those with BPD, as depressive episodes are a big part of the problem.

"I am so sorry you are hurting. I can understand the pain, I deal with severe mental health issues as well.

Can I still look at his side? If he is an unsupportive partner who in fact burdens your life, you should unburden yourself and seperate. Dealing with mental health is hard enough, there is no space to please a ""partner"". 

If he is usually supportive, this might be him at a breaking point. Having a partner with mental health issues is hard as well. And when this is the case, talk. Hear him out. Help him find recourses (is there anything online for relatives of people with mental health problems?)

"I am not at all denying your pain, on the intensity of your pain.  But from reading your past posts, you said that once you got super drunk and called your fiancé a perv. So one possibility is to accept that your mental illness is making life difficult for you but that doesn't mean it can't make life difficult for the person you are in a relationship with as well. One thing that a therapist friend would say is what about if you were able to say (in addition to what you have said here) ""What about if this is good information for me to have?""  And be able to get more information about exactly what burdens he feels. It seems to me that when in a relationship, that's when you definitely want to be in therapy. And when something like this happens, a few sessions of couples therapy would probably help. Mental illness of all kinds is a pain in the ass. And we each have to accept that we are in charge of learning as best we can how to deal with it, manage it."	LostandProvoked	reply	na	na	na	0.9994737505912781	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealth

"My partner has said the same thing before, I have bpd, cptsd, social phobia and am being assessed for adhd. My brain can be a scary place where I see and hear things that aren't there, I always say that my brain is convinced that something will hurt me and I have to fight that feeling every day. 
Before I really put in the work with therapy and medications, I didn't know how to deal with emotions myself. Instead of reflecting on things internally, I always looked for him to help me. Growing up, that's what my family did. We all have pretty complex mental illnesses and physical ailments so it was very common for my siblings to do something traumatic (or even me) and it normalized it. 
He was getting so bogged down with carrying the weight of my illnesses. He always  cooked dinner, did the majority of the cleaning and worked more than me. He kept it all bottled up because he felt bad for me, because life can be hard. And in my dark days, I will admit that I was selfish and blind to his own needs and struggles because I was drowning in my own. 
One day, he lost it and said very hurtful things. But it was after six months of holding it in while he watched me spiral further down. He told me he couldn't continue how we were, it wasn't sustainable. Left no room for his own trauma or mental health needs, left no room for intimacy and connection. It hurt a lot and it took me a while to fully process it. I beat myself up and felt bad about it but eventually I started putting myself in his shoes. 
I still struggle but now I make a point to check in regularly with him. In a calm setting, I'll ask for a ""relationship check in"" where he can say how he's feeling, if he has any needs that aren't being met or if he has something going on that he needs support with. I make a point to ask about his day and ask questions that encourage him to tell me about his passions (for him, it's his workouts and routines. He's a personal trainer). I started keeping track of how many times he's cooked or done a chores in a row. Started thanking him more and doing things like leaving sticky notes around to remind him how much I love him. I try to dress up every now and again and use my good moments to feed into the relationship by planning intimate nights, cleaning up his work station if he's been overloaded with tasks, started going to my friends instead of him when I need to talk (not all the time, but about 60% of the time). If he asks for something, instead of immediately saying no because I'm tired mentally and physically, I try my best to push through it. 
I continue working on my functioning in the house (I'm a very messy person in the house so I've been really working on my cleaning habits), been more trabsperant with him about things (if I notice I've been neglecting something, I will be the first to bring it up and say ""I'm struggling with this but I have plans to get it done on this day"" or ""I need to find another system to help me stay accountable for this, can we brainstorm together"". This makes him feel more confident even when my dark days come because he knows that I see it, I acknowledge the extra weight he has to carry and I'm willing to meet in the middle. My goal with that is so he doesn't have to stress about whether or not I'm going to do it. 
He's also working on not bottling things up and exploding. Our communication has gotten a lot better as well. If he doesn't feel comfortable saying something to me, he knows he can leave me a letter or send me a message online and we have a boundary that I should take a minute and process it before responding so I don't do so emotionally. We use that for times that he's been really wanting to bring something up but he's worried about starting a fight, so that way he can be vulnerable with me.

You aren't a burden. You are you. Now everyone has something in life like mental illness, physical illness or accidents. Could he just mean that sometimes it can be overwhelming for him at times. Truth hurts . You are doing your best with what you have.  Sometimes your partner might be putting your needs over his. I would take it in as a different perspective and just wonder what made him say that. Despite your high and lows he is still there? Does that count for something. Or was he just being honest or just being a dick. Dick then you just think it's a reflection of him. Not a you problem. Not my monkey not my circus. If it's more that he feels the weight of it. I would hear it out otherwise to understand how he came up with the burden theory?  First work on you feel about yourself? Challenge your thought process Do you feel like a burden? 2. Why? Then start asking what do you contribute to life? People kind of underestimate their value of their presence to people. You being here and managing bpd and telling your story helps alot of others who would feel alone. Love yourself and what you bring to the table. Hope this helps you!!!   And repeat yourself that you are valued contributer to society. How you contribute? If you feel you don't how can you improve on it.

"There are many problems at home.
Its a lot of times very toxic, always messy and my mother isnt able to do the basics. She doesnt even know how much money she gets every month or what we spent on food. Every bill just comes up magically in her mind. Its like playling lottery every month to see if we can afford food at the end (bit no worries there is always money fof cigarrets and my bis sister (19))

Well because i (18) also have mental problems, my therapist wanted me to move out. I wouldnt have to pay anything, i get my own room in a flat and live together with other people (16-22). 
The only problem is my mother gets child allowance and half-orphan pension and if i move out she wont. 

After i told her she got very mad at me. Im a traitor and egoistic. I also want them to land on the street. Our current flat isnt payable without me in her eyes but i think that she schould look for a smaller place then? 
Like im 18 schouldnt she be finacially independent from me? 
Also i think that child allowance and my pension is for me and not my mother but i dont get any pocket money or anything else for me.

Well now my family hates me. I dont think i can move out in less than a month but i hate every second at home. When im in a room and someone sees it they turn around and if i leave they enter and talk about how horrible i am. My sisters gossipd 24/7 about how shitty i am with her friends and my mother even wanted to kick me out. 
She only didnt do it because in my country, she is still responsibel for me till i finished school and she would have to pay me several hundred dollars. 
They changed the passwords everywhere. I can even use the laptop i need for school.

I dont know how to do it. I feel like a stranger in a home i lived in since im 5.

"I am a 17 year old female. So My friends from highschool all left me and they all told me they no longer wanted to be friends with me anymore. I told one of my ex-friends that I thought their friend was rude and was insensitive towards people's feelings, and bc of the way he spoke to me I would never interact with him, and he would yell saying that I am rude. She then said that 'he didn't mean it' and that 'it was just a joke' and then I asked if she still wanted to be friends with me (just as a question) and she said 'no thank you.' Another friend who I shortly reconciled with last december also told me she didn't want to be friends with me anymore because she was 'tired', she didn't see the point in being friends with me anymore and told me that she had 'made up her mind'. I am now currently in college, but there have been many days where I would go back home by bus whilst crying because of the pain. Someone that I go to college with (who is also friends with my ex-friends) has said all sorts of things to me regarding to the situation which really hurt my feelings and didn't consider how I felt due to the situation. He even said things like ""Oh, you're so emo"" or ""I feel like you are going to get revenge on my friends"". He also brings up my ex friends in conversations and then he's like ""Oh sorry. I shouldn't have spoken about them"" when he already knew what happened. After that situation he kept pressuring me to find new friends ""otherwise he wouldn't be friends with me anymore"" when I'm not mentally and emotionally prepared to have friends again after everything that happened. He also told me that when he was speaking to one of his friends during one weekend about me, he told her that he ""doesn't see me as a friend because of what I said."" Sometimes on the bus I see my ex-friends all happy and laughing while I feel as if I'm left in a deep, empty pit on the ground. Its like no one ever gave a damn about how I felt. Even though this happened last year, I've noticed when I was at my cousins house on Friday and her cousin came and they both went to the cinema, I suddenly felt emotionally triggered bc it reminded me of how I got treated by my friends. Recently, the friend at school is beginning to pressure me to find new friends again bc he is going to go to another college next year but I'm just not emotionally or mentally prepared to have friends again. I am waiting to cut this boy (the day before he goes to his new college) out of my life bc the way he spoke to me regarding to the situation hurt me so much I cried everyday after school.

"I lost all my friends (friends for over a decade) due to my mental health when I was 27. It was brutal, and I totally know what you mean about not being ready to seek out new friendships, I wasn't either, for a while. However, I started a new job where I happened to really jive with the social environment and I made some good work friends, and met my current best friend who is legitimately the best friend I had ever had. Meeting her made me realize how unkind my old friends were, and how poorly they treated me, and talking about it all with her, she validated the experience I was going through that led my ""friends"" to dumping me (it wasn't all unjustified and we were honestly all kind of going through it at the time in our own ways) and now that I have such a wonderful person in my life, I have really healed/began healing a lot of the negative self talk I had about myself about being unloved and unlovable, worthless etc. I will say honestly, I think I got extremely lucky with her because I've never been the best at making new friendships last or really allowing myself to really connect with other people, but we became fast friends, and I'd do just about anything for that woman. I put a lot of intention into being the kind of friend she deserves, and she says I am the best best friend she has ever had, and she adores me and values me. 

This is something SO unusual for me, as I grew up really isolated and those 3 friends who dropped me when I was 27, they were distant friends. They never really included me in anything, never were really all that caring about me, put me down a fair amount, hurt my feelings on a regular basis, I just didn't know any better to be able to see how unhealthy those friendships were, how they were hurting me and that honestly, they were kind of just mean girls. 

I understand that you're feeling too vulnerable to begin forging new friendships at this exact moment, but please don't write it off entirely. I feel if I can be pleasantly surprised by life, and win the best friend jackpot, other people are just as entitled to being able to find their true friends and supporters in their lives. I went into that job with the mindset that I was going to keep my head down, do my job and just keep to myself. But once I started, I for some weird reason really ""fit in"" with the whole store full of people who don't fit in (like myself) and I was able to make some fun, solid connections with people there. Even if the friendships didn't go far beyond work, or that I am no longer in contact with people since leaving the store, they were still people I considered to be on my team, no matter how temporary it was. 

Please don't give up. And you did nothing wrong, by the way. If they dropped you because you stood up for yourself, those are not the types of people you want to be around. They are, like my friends were, just being mean. That's not true friendship, and it's a waste of your emotional energy, care, worry, and the love you may have had for them. I truly believe if you're open to it (even if you're not seeking it) the right relationships will find you sooner or later. My bestie is still one of just 4 friends I have, but I did just meet someone new while volunteering and we have been getting together to for coffee and she is helping me knit! I'm saying this because I think friendships may be able to come out of a variety of places, situations and dynamics. This woman is probably 15 years or more older than I am, she's married, seems to be financially well off, and we totally get along and I can be my weird little self around her, and so far it's going super well! 

Please, don't give up and remember that those ""friends"" are being assholes, and mistreating you and you don't need or deserve that. Allow them to fuck off, because you're better off. It may not feel like it at the moment, but I can tell you that my time on my own was way better (in retrospect) than the 13 years I spent being friends with a group of people who didn't even really care about me. I was better off without them, and losing them allowed the space for true friendships to blossom. Totally worth the pain, in the end.

"Hi I need someone to give me good advice and also listen. 

I'm stuck in a pit of depression. I have been for a long time. My friend feels suicidal and I'm worried at the moment I can't help as I'm not well with in myself. I am trying my best to help. I'm worried I'm gonna wake up one day and she is gone. 

I've experienced a huge loss and a bit of betrayal so I find it hard to get close to people. I may stop talking after a while or act flaky. On top of this I have memory problems. So sometimes I forget to respond. 

I'm struggling in work as I get anxious and holding down a full time job is difficult. I need to figure out the next steps so I can sustain myself. I don't know what to do or what I want. 

I'll continue to support the people I care about as best I can even if I feel meh. Because I'll be dammed if something happens and I could have prevented it. 

I feel a bit suicidal myself right now.

"There were a lot of things, tragic things, that happened to me recently. Financial, academics, and longingness to return home. Last week, we had our case presentation and the panel decided for a complete revision and repeat conference. Everyone's crying, of course, considering the money spent, sleepless nights, and all. But I was just standing at the corner, looking at them. Yes, I feel sad but there's no tears coming from my eyes. And today, I feel so down. Just finished our exams. My body seems to admit that I'm drained. And my chest kind of heavy. I feel the need to cry. But I can't. I can't. And it's aching not able to cry. I'm trying to stimulate my emotions into thinking sad thoughts and events. But nothing happened.

I think this is because of repressing my emotions for a long time that I forgot the emotion itself. But it's unsettling. Still got a heavy heart right now and a desire to cry.

"""You're struggling through a loss(es), but emotionally not sure what that loss(es) means to you."" At least I remember my psychologist explaining that too me when I told him I couldn't cry. I bet you just don't want to think back on all the hard work and draining effort that you put in to get where you are right now, and that's fine. If it's traumatic, I wouldn't either. So yea, this is likely from repressing your emotions a bit to help get you through everything you were going through. You're probably still repressing it, unsure if another curve ball is heading your way. When you feel safe and vulnerable (you likely won't notice when you are), it'll def probably hit you then.

"My mental health has been bad for many years, up and down. Child abuse, domestic abuse, toxic relationships etc. It's been messy. I've finally got enough self respect that I won't be in these positions again. But I'm feeling really down that all I've been through has taken away who I am.

I used to love singing and dancing (badly), cooking from scratch and baking, playing with my son and being silly, and mostly I used to have a real soft and caring streak. I was able to be really optimistic even through the biggest shit storms.

The singing and dancing is somewhat coming back but...I struggle to cook a basic meal, I can't keep up with house work, I'm so overwhelmed and overstimulated all the time, I have to often force myself to be with my son which makes me hate myself and that softness is gone. Even my voice is harsher than it used to be. I have no optimism left, it mostly comes out as ""jokes"" but I'm just so pessimistic and negative now.

Ive been in survival mode for a long time. I'm scared that I'll never get back to those parts of me. I don't even know how to attempt it. Do I just keep on focusing on healing?

"First of all, you are a champion for saying that you don't want to go back to the awful things you left behind. That in itself takes a lot of strength, every damn day ❤️

Secondly, you're trying to heal. A broken leg continues to hurt even when you take steps to make it better and it keeps hurting until it's healed. You will feel better, but it just might be on a longer timeline. But look for little things each day, tiny spots of joy. You had a laugh, you enjoyed a sunset, you kept a meal down without gagging, you hugged your kid and said you love them. Small things, because they all add up to the big thing.

Personally I think your path lies somewhere between accepting that you're currently in a state of fatigue and trying to heal, but also believing that things get better, because they can. Belief is a very powerful thing, and you can and will get better. It just takes time. It hasn't taken away from who you are, it's added to who you are. You're just trying to find the balance of who you want to be now. You said you're a kind and caring person, so extend that to yourself too. You'll be ok.

The worst thing is that i dont even have real problems, just a bunch of small things that ill probably get over eventually but it just happened all at the same time and i dont know how to keep going. i dont think anything makes me happy or even satisfied enough to not think about things for a bit. Ive been alone my whole life and its kinda settling in that i dont know how to change that. ive taken 5 naps in the last 2 days.

"Hello, I'm F20, and I've been experiencing various symptoms of declining mental health for about a year now, but have struggled with anxiety since I was very young (6-7). I strongly believe that this is due to trauma surrounding growing up with an emotionally explosive parent (who has slammed doors, punched holes in walls, purposely broke various household items when angry, etc.), exposure to verbal altercations between my parents, and growing up in a household which always felt generally tense, since the ""vibe"" of the day typically relied on how the explosive parent felt.

In July 2022, I began to experience intense DP/DR, anxiety, feelings of emptiness, panic attacks (triggered by yelling/loud sudden noises or built up anxious feelings), mood swings, loss of sense of self, intense brain fog, and a general sense of emptiness. These symptoms seem to lessen and worsen depending on the day, but they have all persisted for almost a year. However, I can't help but hold on to the idea that I might just be exaggerating these or faking it. But then again, why would I WANT to put myself through these? But my dad makes comments like ""she needs to get over it"" and ""I don't understand why you want to feel like this"", and they really get to me.

I don't know what I have or what diagnosis is awaiting for me in August (I have a psychiatrist appointment) but I'm afraid that it's just not as bad as I'm making it out to be. But again, if I had the choice, why would I choose this? I don't know, I'm sure this sounds silly, but has anyone else struggled with these thoughts?"

I have no helpful advice, but I can tell you that you're not alone. I have effectively gaslit myself into believing that things that happened to me in my life I was making up (I most def am *not)* and I think telling myself this is a way to cope. As like one of my primary ways of coping, I dismiss, invalidate, belittle, or ignore my own feelings, experience and such. I have also thought that I was more or less faking my mental health issues at times as well. Again, I am not, by any stretch of the imagination. It's all real, and it all happened. It's just hard to cope with reality sometimes and telling myself I'm making things up can be easier.	Significant_Duck_926	reply	na	na	na	0.1295304298400879	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealth

"I am sorry your mom is going insane. Are you safe? Where is she finding all of these human bones? 

It may be illegal to keep human bones. If you would tell someone say the police about these bones, would you have a place to stay if they cart her off? Although I kind of doubt with healthcare in the abysmal state it is, they might not do anything at all to help her mental state sadly. 

I do know Detroit is a human trafficking hub, and if the bones are indeed human, turning them in could possibly bring closure to some random family out there. Not just trafficking victims but any missing person/ unsolved death. It is simply not usual or normal to happen across so many human bones in the wild, that one has a literal collection of them, Detroit or not. Is there a graveyard nearby?

I came from a very toxic on and off 8 year anxious-avoidant relationship. This relationship included him emotionally cheating on me with 2 girls, the usual stone-walling, shutting off avoidant shit. I finally mustered the strength to leave the said relationship last Nov 2022 with the help of a rebound. Early months into 2023 was healing for me beacause i fell in love with a secure (i think?) partner but then I started spiraling downwards after we broke up due to personal reasons (healthy break-up). I was sleeping soundly, my nervous system hasn’t skyrocketed, my anxiety was at bay, I was healing. However, I started seeing and talking to my ex again last week and months of healing and self-love just washed down the drain in a blink of an eye. I just finished the book “Attached” by Amir Levine and it helped me understand fully my attachment and that my ex’s. He wants me back. And i now understood his need to want me back and i think he’s on labeling me as his “phantom ex” hence his persistence on wanting me back. But this circumstance has my anxiety on highest level, last night I had to self-soothe because he forgot to update me he has come home already and he just slept. I am on my wits end. I am torn between giving this relationship another chance yet I know this is bad for my mental health. I don’t know what to do. Should I give this relationship another chance? Is he capable of becoming a safe haven for me as an anxious person? I need help	HolycrapihavePCOs	post	32.346979967257546	male	White	0.9989984631538391	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
I think you know what to do, this person isn't good for you. No, I don't see any reason to take someone back who has you feeling like this, especially after making significant progress in your healing. Let it go, lose the dudes number/block him wherever you may need to. You don't need to be hurting.	HolycrapihavePCOs	reply	na	na	na	0.9989984631538391	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealth
"I'm having an extra hard time with my emotions lately. I had been on an SSRI for over a decade and am almost fully off of it after slowly titrating down (reason being, I plan to try psilocybin-assisted therapy for my ED and PTSD as I've been stuck for years). Maybe the harder time is just that I feel things more, or am more aware of my emotions as opposed to being so numbed out…

Now, I know no one's life goes perfectly according to plan, and tragedy happens to everyone. As a kid, I thought I'd grow up, be married and have two kids of my own. That didn't happen. I just turned 34 and the last of my close friends my age have now just had babies. Not only am I not married, I haven't even been in a longterm relationship…ever. My longest relationships are about 3 months. I never let anyone in closer than that.

I have PTSD after (TW, SA in early teens) having been sexually abused/raped \~300 times as a young teen. (I still struggle with self-blame and struggle to call it rape, because no gun to my head, but I was groomed and manipulated and threatened throughout it all). When the abuse finally ended and I went away to college, I felt ""free"" for the first time in my life, and despite nightmares from the PTSD, I was doing pretty well.

That's when I had my first normal relationship. I didn't open up and get super close, but I was with a good guy. I met great people at college. Still keep in touch with some of those friends daily.

But a few months into college, my dad died suddenly and unexpectedly. Going through that somehow triggered my other, worse trauma and I couldn't cope anymore. I wound up with an eating disorder which became severe by that summer, and I had to go to a hospital to save my life.

Without divulging too many details, that was kind of bad too because I was in treatment for a long time. Met good people, had a great therapist, got to do some normal things while in treatment, but mostly…lived in a hospital and the winter was lonely. Spent birthday and Christmas there. Remember sleeping in the library when I got out on a weekend and didn't have family around, remember how sad I was.

I did finish college when I got out of treatment. I'm in the career I wanted to be in! I never gave up on that. I'm glad I made it in that realm. I have passions and great friends and some good things in my life right now.

But situationally I am so grief-stricken and depressed being this age and knowing it's too late for me when everything painful happened in a row. I feel like I didn't get a chance. To live without pain, you know?

This is a slight side note but I feel stuck in therapy and I'm afraid I'll come across agitated by complaining here. Because maybe having gone down on my Zoloft is making it easier for me to get agitated. But sometimes I'm kind of bummed out that my therapist wants to talk about one date I went on or random gossipy silly things when I'm hurting so much inside. I know she keeps it light sometimes because she knows I struggle so much daily.

I'm sorry this is so long and all over the place. I guess what I'm asking (aside from just needing to get this all off my chest) is how do you move forward knowing you lost so much and it's too late for the life you wanted? What if I wanted kids? I wanted to be a mom. It's hard to figure out what I'm living for. I know what brings me joy. I know I love certain people (family, friends). I love certain things about life. But it also seems too hard and so sad sometimes."	sandopsio	post	28.799020372415974	female	White	0.9915217161178589	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth

"im 17, i'm not sure how to write this paragraph but i thought maybe letting my feelings out would make me feel better.  
i recently lost interest in my hobbies like drawing or gaming and anything in life, everyday i just wake up prepare myself and go to school, i dont feel the hype of anything anymore, the hype of meeting ur friends  or some future events. i used to have a group of online friends i hanged around with 2021 and 2022 but theyre all busy right now so i dont really have anything to do or anyone to talk to. i would love to get professional help but my family just isnt the right one to ask.  
my finals are coming next week and i planned to study these few days, im quite the sensitive person so i get distracted easily, i made a study scehdule and everything but i just dont seem to be productive, i studied history for around three hours and did not pick up a single thing i feel like im just wasting my time and life away and i am on the verge of breaking down cause of how useless i feel, i searched up many study methods, noted them down but i just dont seem to successfully do it :/

"Hey.. I completely understand the way you are feeling and I wish I could come and give you a hug. What you are going through is stressful so you’re feelings are completely valid. I’m sorry that you don’t feel that your family are the right people to go to for help. Have you ever thought of sitting them down and expressing how you feel? Sorry if that’s not the best advice obv I don’t know how your family reacts to that kind of thing. 

When I find I’m having trouble staying focused when studying I also make a study schedule!! I find it can be so helpful so I would say to try and really stick to it. Make sure that it’s reasonable though and you are giving yourself breaks. Studying for 3 hours in a row in theory sounds like a great idea… but it can be hard to retain information without taking some breaking during those 3 hours. One tip I like to do is active recall. What I would do in your case maybe for a specific event in history is I would write down what I know about the event (including the dates). Then I would check my textbook or notes from class to make sure I am right. Then I would ask a question about the event out loud and answer it out loud. Then you read what you wrote before and see if it’s correct. It does take a lot of time but is extremely helpful!

Depression brings a lot of avoidance. Pressure for him to visit a therapist or specialist is the kind of harsh love he'd need. Don't need to force him, but keep up a constant reminder to commit visiting someone.	Old_Movie3534	reply	na	na	na	0.0015913040842860937	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth
It's amazing to hear that you want to be there for your partner and help him through this difficult time. Supporting someone who's experiencing depression isn't always easy, and it can often take a toll on you as well. But it's so valuable and important to have a support system. The first thing to do is to have open and honest communication about how he's doing and what he's experiencing. Then, you can start to work together to identify what he might need in terms of support. This could include things like helping him with daily tasks, helping to problem-solve, or providing emotional support.	Old_Movie3534	reply	na	na	na	0.0015913040842860937	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealth
Therapy isn't everything. Looking after people with depression is hard work , but I can be more achievable, but you have to make sure that you look after yourself first. You can't feed people off of an empty plate. Get your routine better, look after you, and if you feel you have the energy, help your partner to find the same thing. Sometimes just having a solid routine can really lift the mood (mine is literally get out of bed, make breakfast, watch some YouTube. Then maybe go for a walk or a ride on my bike for a bit). Having a sleep routine for me was difficult as I suffer from insomnia that comes and goes in waves. But having a good foundation to build from helps a lot. At the moment you need to be that if you want to help him, so make sure you're stable first.	Old_Movie3534	reply	na	na	na	0.0015913040842860937	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealth

"My boyfriend just went through a depression and it helped him a lot that I gave him a lot of space when he asked me to. And that I didn't get angry when he didn't do anything all day or quit working etc. 

I did however ask him every day how he was doing really and if he wanted to talk about it. I told him I could give him all the space he needed but that I wanted him to be hoest about how he was feeling. We could even talk about suicidal thought together without me getting really scared or upset. 

It helped him to get some dogs in the house for loan, so that he had to walk them 3 times a day. And it helped him to sleep a lot. 

tbh everyone has their own needs when in depression. However, most people need some understanding that it is hard and that it really feels like it will never go away again. And they really need a good day to say rhythm.

"I guess there might be reasons but they all feel stupid, like there’s no reason to be depressed about them. It makes me feel weak that I’m so stressed like this for such trivial things. I really wish I was stronger than this.

There’s so many things in this world that are traumatic and actually depressing and here I am being all hung up over school and my parents.

I hate my life even though I live such a good one. I’m not in poverty, I have a comfortable house and room, I’m in an amazing school and get good grades. So many kids living in worse conditions than me would kill to be where I am so why am I not happy???

Why am I burnt out in high school? I was the one who chose the school with a higher workload. Why do I feel like my life is going nowhere? Even though I’m so young it feels like I’m going to be living a lie my whole life…

Then my parents. My dad scares me, he’s unpredictable and shouts at me a lot, it stresses me out but even so, he’s still good to me and does everything normal dads do. It feels like I’m wrong for being scared of him.

I’m just so tired of it all, I don’t want to die but this life is just the opposite of everything I want and it seems like the only reason I make it through each day is just because of my will to live. This doesn’t feel like living, I’m barely surviving… maybe there is a reason after all. It just seems insignificant."

"There’s never no reason when mental health is involved.  

What you experience as your reality is after your brain, your mind, your subconscious have done a whole load of processing to combine your in the moment with your past experiences and feelings.  If your mind has been traumatised by any bad or difficult experiences, your experience of life can be affected.  How you see yourself can be affected.

You mention your dad.  Has he always been angry like that?  If you’re always on edge or scared of him then that could well be affecting you subconsciously.  You could, at some level, be living your life so he doesn’t get angry and that means you’re not living for you and because of that you aren’t seeing your worth in what you do. 

Look up attachment theory.  An angry dad won’t allow you the secure sense of attachment your mind needs to feel confident and happy.

Also look up ACE, adverse childhood experiences… angry dad again.  

Also, as a teenager you are becoming more aware of you and the world around you. You may be experiencing some level of existential crisis

Brains are complicated places and so many things can affect how they work and, as a result, how you experience life and how you experience being you.

I'm riding higher and higher, yet the string keeps on going. Sometimes the tension comes back and I feel the anxiety build up in my chest but I'm singing and acting silly again. I feel giddy and zoomy and it's just not right.
I'm afraid it may be my meds. I'm afraid it may be something worse. I don't think have bipolar and my therapist/med provider hasn't mentioned it this time around.

"i don't think there's such a thing as being too happy or uplifted, and in my opinion the only time feeling good is a negative is if it's causing harm to anyone. as long as that isn't the case, i would say you're fine, and should embrace the feeling without worry.

have you ever had issues with feeling like there *must* be negative feelings to ""equal out"" positive ones? or that there simply must be a drawback for being happy? one of my friends struggled to enjoy positive events or feelings because they always waited for the ""price"" for it, which they would assign to the first bad thing that happened, no matter how obviously unrelated to them it was.

if that isn't the case and you're just completely baffled by the feelings, then if you can, try to pin down and interrogate the thoughts as they come up to figure out why they're here. just like with real people, if they have no justification nor reason then they aren't worth listening to.

"I have a permanent physical disability, along with some fun emotional traumas, and come from a long line of dysfunctionality. One parent left when I was 12, the other when I was 17. To say I've seen my fair share of shit is an understatement.

I've realized I have a lot of baggage that needs to be unpacked for good, and I'm making progress, but I find myself hitting a familiar wall:

Because I had to learn a lot of things for myself (and often the hard way), I almost take offence when someone asks me how I did something. It's almost like I'm that kid in class that no one wants to be friends with, but everyone wants to copy their answers on a test.

I know a true leader is someone who shares their knowledge and wants to see other people succeed. I do want to see people be successful, I just don't want to give people the answers that I had to struggle for.

As an example, I went through a big weight loss. There were a lot of people asking me for tips on how I did it, and I was reluctant to tell anyone because I worked SO hard to figure it out for myself.

"i can't offer much beyond my own personal reasoning for why i want to go out of my way to help and teach people, since i feel we have fascinatingly opposite ways of viewing this subject.

to keep it short and avoid traumadumping *too much* in someone else's post, i've always been isolated from the world by my parents. i was taken out of school after one day because of the simple fact that the school mostly consisted of black people, and racism took priority over their child having an education. at 25, i still don't even have an ID, nor enough paperwork to *get* one.

suffice it to say i've always had an immense deficiency in knowledge, problem-solving, social etiquette, and experience, and so i've always had a lot of questions. questions with incredibly obvious answers to most people, which has fairly consistently led to me being met with impatience, anger, and mockery. i could never distinguish what was ""worthy"" of being a question without being torn apart for being a moron; it's like being called stupid and laughed out of the room for guessing the ball is under the wrong cup, when you were blindfolded while they were being shuffled. and then the next person who gets it wrong gets sage nods of understanding or a few chuckles and a pat on the back, because it's normal for people to get it wrong. it's maddening.

so i learned not to ask for help, and not to ask questions. i learned things alone, by studying others, or waiting for someone else to ask (which i've found to be the most reliable indicator for a ""worthy question""), and i'm still stricken with *immense* anxiety if i do something for the first time in front of someone who's done it before. even now with my closest friends, i still outright refuse to do anything new with them if they've done it before. it's made me miss out on an unknowable amount of bonding, fun, and experiences, i'm sure.

now i look at all of that, my complexes and anxiety, the ridicule i've been subjected to for something i can't help, the systems i've had to build to maintain a veneer of competence, and i think ""i wouldn't have to do any of this if someone would have just been nice to me and answered my silly but genuine questions.""

so all of this has led to me being extremely patient and gentle with those who ask questions. with just a handful of words i can give someone clarity and understanding, i can make them feel safe and able to ask more questions if they don't quite understand, i can ease the anxiety it may have taken for them to reach out, i can be an example of not being rude even when answering questions that are supposedly ""obvious"", i can make my impact on someone's life- however brief- a positive one, i can spread knowledge to degrees i'll never know (i wonder how many people have parroted what i've said to others who have had similar questions, or how many people were like me and quietly watching to gleam the information for themselves?)

the main motivator for me though, is to prevent other people from going through what i had to. it's needless suffering, and there's no reason to perpetuate it beyond personal spite, especially when it's one of the easiest opportunities to be kind to others, to be the person that i didn't have.

i did not succeed in keeping it short, but hopefully my perspective does.. *something* for you lol. i wish you luck on your journey of self improvement, i'm proud of you for making the progress you've made so far. just being aware of this problem is a good step, even if it's not obvious how you can conquer it."	getyourglow	reply	na	na	na	0.9917248487472534	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth

It can be tough at first. These mental health pages are pretty fair game. Sometimes it can hard say if you have to post about it in r/suicide because that can be triggering if you are avoiding that and not ready to walk through that Death Valley. I have been journaling when I’m out of control, posting on mental health or thoughts, and writing a lot of poetry when I am in a good groove. But sometimes things can be too rough for poetry.

"HI 

You sound very overwhelmed and depressed.   Find the energy to get help and medication to help you to cope with whatever is going on.  If you are on meds already, then it is time for a change or adjustment.   We must never let ourselves get so hopeless that there doesn't seem to be an answer or solution.   Please, trust in those of us that have been there and believe that you will be alright.   

You need a safe and controlled place to talk about your feelings.   Although, it might seem easy to tell your thoughts to an online chat where you don't have to feel like being judged, in a crisis, you need professional support.

I tried to post my life struggles by seeking advice on an escape plan out from my mother after I got the courage to post about how she had groomed me since a little girl into making me believe it was my responsibility to always support her financially (I was homeschooled, “aka no school” never allowed friends or knew the real world much until she allowed me internet) on r/narcissisticabuse or whatever, I got an autoban and a rude message from a mod saying I was “soft begging”… LOL. I realized then their was no hope out so I gave up. Needless to say, never felt more helpless in my life. Supporting her with SW since I was 16, and I got accused of begging for money. I have always supported us and my kids. I never asked anybody for help. I have never needed help is the thing.. I work for our money. It was a complete kick to the face. I told my therapist about it, and she said to try writing it down and tearing it up, then after that I needed to work better on my triggers. So I felt like double shit. I always try to avoid my triggers but I thought that place was a safe place. Some Reddit forums suck & are hypocrites. The more I analyze it, that mod probably got jealous at the idea of I guess someone maybe possibly offering to help or give advice?… But then again, I never asked for help financially, I have never needed help with money as I’ve been taught very young it’s my job to always support and supply. I have never been handed a thing, let alone would think what the Mod did. All I did was ask for advice on a way out of my situation (aka how to grow some balls) so I could invest in my kids future instead of cigs and pot for my mother who has never worked a day in her life.

"I still live with my parents, and they seem pretty sure that I’m addicted to the internet and video games. Deep down I think there’s some truth to it, but I don’t really want to tell them that because that’s the kind of information they’d probably weapon or against me. 

Most of my time online is spent socializing. Just today I was on the phone for a good few hours talking, laughing, and taking turns showing each other shows we had prepared for “movie night”. And honestly, the connections I’ve made are some of the biggest helps I’ve had in order to grow as a person. I’m not sure if that’s a bad thing or not, but it has. As someone who is neurodivergent and queer in a home that isn’t very happy about either of those things, it’s pretty hard to find friends who are like me, and it’s so hard for me to leave the house, let alone even shower consistently. I WANT to, more than anything, but I fail so much. So remote connections are often the best I have. 

My parents are upset that I’m so unproductive and despondent, and have made talk of sending me to “one of those camps for addiction.” Honestly, the scariest part of that isn’t me not being able to play video games or whatever, it’s total cutoff from my friends (assuming internet access is either taken away entirely or limited to an hour or less). 

I’m not sure what to think. Do I truly have an addiction? And would having my access be restricted really be what’s best for me?"	yoomtahzing	post	24.51675903132993	male	White	0.0024449736811220646	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
">As someone who is neurodivergent and queer in a home that isn’t very happy about either of those things, it’s pretty hard to find friends who are like me, and it’s so hard for me to leave the house, let alone even shower consistently. 

This sounds like you are very sad about your family not accepting you and that this is affecting your Self-Esteem.

If you want to break out of any addiction the key is to find activities that make you happy like Workout, Hobby, Learning something new and basically spreading out your interests as to not rely on internet/friends for your happiness.

However if you don't even feel like showering, it may be because you are constantly thinking negative things about yourself and every interaction with your family is unconfortable due to them not accepting who you are.

Depending on your age it would be good to talk to them to start therapy as to talk this things with a professional or find a job to move out. 

Anyways, meeting new people may not be a bad idea, it may seem scary but **usually people are way more chill about sexuality and diversity** (your parents are probably the exception). You will be surprised of how chill the world is outside of your parents, you probably have friends online that you enjoy talking to, but you will be surprised how many people - even if not like you- will be willing to ***hang out and accept you for who you are***."	yoomtahzing	reply	na	na	na	0.0024449736811220646	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealth
"So cards on the table first, over the last couple of years I've been diagnosed with comorbid bipolar II and BPD. The latter diagnosis was more recent and I'm still trying to get my head around it.

I've been struggling a lot recently but in trying to boil it down to one key issue, it's the silence. I have always lived with either a roommate or a romantic partner but in the past 2 years I've lived alone. I have a cat, who is an affectionate wee sweetheart and keeps me company, but I can't help but feel that every time I come home my apartment feels empty.

Sometimes this is after work-- usually when I get off a shift I prolong going home as much as I can these days. Sometimes it's after spending time with a friend, or talking to a friend online. I experience such a massive drop off afterwards, where I feel acutely alone and isolated. Ftr I'm a trans woman so as much as being in public can put the fear on me, some nights being at home does it just as much.

Idk it feels mental, given that I'm a generally private person who appreciates my alone time, to freak out about coming home to an empty flat. But sometimes I get back here and it's so quiet that I just want to scream.

I guess I'm not looking for an answer per se. But if there's anyone out there who deals with similar who would at least confirm to me that I'm not alone and not crazy for this, I would appreciate it.

So for background, I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, adhd, and ptsd. Before one of my appointments, I did extensive research about the possibility of having a mood disorder. When I read about Borderline Personality Disorder, I checked almost all the symptoms of it. I brought this up to my psychiatrist, but she said, “Someone with BPD wouldn’t think they have it.” I thought this was a weird response. Is she right?	coolzzzzzz	post	28.405237435147946	female	White	0.9726860523223877	na	na	na	8	MentalHealth

Well, the thing is that it is possible for someone with any mental health condition to be aware that they may have that condition. Some people with Borderline Personality Disorder might be aware that they have it, while others might not be. So the psychiatrist's comment that someone with BPD wouldn't think they have it is not always true. But it's also true that the way Borderline Personality Disorder presents in individuals can be very different. Some people may exhibit a combination of the symptoms to varying degrees, while others may only show certain symptoms but not others.

"This gonna sound dumb, but the more you read into problems, the more you believe you start having the problem. Correlation doesn't equal causation, sometimes it can just be a coincidence that things from other problems line up and make something else make sense.

Borderline is also not a mood disorder, you are thinking bipolar disorder. 

I disagree with the idea you would not think you have it, but it sounds more like you're psychiatrist thinks focusing on the adhd and ptsd will resolve more of and explain more of your symptoms 

One more point, the over stimulus associated with adhd and ptsd can actually be treated with medication while there is really no medication for a personality disorder.

Tldr diagnoses are mostly for insurance and there is lots of overlap. Eliminating symptoms of ptsd and adhd will also eliminate what you are experiencing with borderline personality disorder, or at least make it way easier to cope with."	coolzzzzzz	reply	na	na	na	0.9726860523223877	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth

people always tell me to be yourself, but i don't know who the fuck i am, i know what i want to be like, but it's too scary to start acting like that. and I'm not sure if i know how to. saying hi to my classmate is stressful. walking in front of people is stressful. i know it doesn't matter what they think but i just can't help it. 
and even if i wanted to start conversation with someone, i don't know what to say, i literally can't start a conversation (probably because my parents never allowed me to meet with my peers when i was younger, i remember being in 3rd grade wanting to go to party of friend i finnally felt more comfortable with buty parents refused)
i have this problem since i remember, my only memory from kindergarten is watching other kids play, i never joined them
I'm bringing this all up because we have a trip that is a week long with people i only know from seeing them at school, i want to use that time to try and overcome some of my fears, but i don't know how to
because even if i start to have conversation with someone i will either get bored if we're talking about sth boring (i recently realized that when talking with one of my friends k wasn't even paying attention to what she was saying, like we are technically friends but she was talking about sth really boring, is that sth i should work on) and start to zone out until someone else joins us and I'll be the third wheel, or i will just get stressed and start freaking out

I honestly don’t really know what to do anymore. I feel so lonely and depressed but I don’t tell any of my family about it. I have one person that I tell some stuff too but I don’t want to overwhelm them with everything. The last week or two I’ve cried myself to sleep almost every night. I struggle to fall asleep and don’t fall asleep until 2 in the morning because I’ve just been overthinking so much I ware myself out and cry until I fall asleep. I’m “talking” to a girl right now too but I’m not really the only guy. I always love talking to her because she’s such an amazing person in so many ways. Whenever I’m talking to her and get left on delivered for 20,30,40,50 minutes sometimes it hurts. I think what hurts more though is that I know she’s talking to other guys. That hurts a lot. I can be talking about something amazing but then I’ll think that there are other guys in the picture too and I’m not the only one. It’s gotten to the point where if I’m alone in my room at night for more than an hour I usually end up crying. I workout to take my mind off things and that helps temporarily but I also just get so frustrated with myself. I don’t really know what the central message of this post is but if any of you have any tips on fixing myself I’d love to hear them. Whether it’s hateful or nice comments I’d love to hear them all.

"Hello  
  
In my opinion your biggest issue is **Emotional Dependency / Codependency**: Basically your only source of happiness is people (girlfriend/friend) instead of from multiple sources (hobby, work,etc)... Even your username has the word ""Dependent"" on it!  
  
\- Our **Activities affect our self esteem**: It's important to have different areas in your life that make you feel happy, not be emotionally dependant on one area (for example a girlfriend)  
  
\+ Exercise / Sports  
  
\+ Hobbies  
  
\+ Friends / Love/ Family  
  
\+ Working or Studying  
  
\+ Having long term projects in our life by yourself , etc.  
  
The key is to not obsess over one area and spend all your resources there because your SELF ESTEEM will depend on that thing only (relationship) and you will feel empty, depressed and suicidal when that doesn't work out. Because if you don't have other activities suddenly this is all you have in your life. Literally, every hour of your day is focused on that relationship.  
  
You will be constantly insecure, checking hes messagess, feeling bad when she isn't around: *That's not love, it's dependency!*

This emotional dependency is the reason why people stay in abusive relationship knowing it's bad for them or why they become extremely controlling of their partner and sabotage themselves.  
  
Your Anxiety can be caused by negative thoughts about yourself (self doubt, blaming, feeling inferior, ""sacrificing"" yourself for others, etc)  
  
\- **Our Thoughts affect our mood**: What we think is what we feel, if you spend all day thinking bad things about yourself then you will feel bad. Thinking that she doesn't like you because you are flawed and that nobody will love you then you will feel bad all day-  
  
Taking the blame for everything and thinking negatively about yourself is the equivalent of eating rotten fruit: *It doesn't matter who sold that to you in the past, the problem is that you are still eating it!*  
  
All those thoughts that you have, you gotta ask yourself:  
  
**Are they actually true?**  
  
**How useful are them?**  
  
If you assume something as true without questioning it, you will let this very toxic thoughts ruin your mood daily. This internal dialogue, even if in some situation is true, is not useful, and consuming that daily will make your mood worse.

Hello everyone,

I don't know how to do this or if I should even do it but I just need to let it all out and maybe ask some advice/help. 

I (26F), am currently coming to terms of a part of myself that I guess I've been denying. I've always told anyone who would ask I don't need anyone (where I'm from a lot will ask why I'm not married yet or have a boyfriend). Even to friends, yes I enjoy when we get together but I usually prefer going home and just doing my own thing. 

Since pandemic my only constant social activity is gaming with cousins but now that has also stopped. (One got married, one got busy with college and one has lost interest on gaming apparently) so now, yes I got lonely. 

I recently met online friends that play the same game and has been in a high of happiness as we got along really well but now theres this urge in me to 'test' them. Like will they notice if I suddenly went radio silence. 

Ofcourse logically they shouldn't, we just met after all. But it seems like I want their attention. 

I'm actually a clingy person I guess 🥹

I don't know what to do and just wanted to get it off my chest and ask strangers for help.

Thank you for taking the time to read this"	OkLet2806	post	15.931525074901842	male	White	0.0062111178413033485	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
"It's pretty normal actually: We need different areas in our life in order to be happy and **socialization is an irreplaceable one**.

Usually it goes like this:

\+ Exercise / Sports

\+ Having long term projects in our life by yourself , etc.

What's happening is that since your online friends are your only source of socialization, suddenly you are feeling insecure because if they left that would leave a void in your life again *(and your self-esteem knows that feeling)*.

It's not like you are Clingy, it's that **we all need social life to be happy**. You are basically milking them (that doesn't sound good) ... I mean you are squeezing them dry (ehem...) you get the idea...

"I’m creating this post as I have no other choice and I will be discussing a very serious issue right here and therefore warn all readers for explicit content..  
  
I am currently 18 years old male and I’m here asking help on what to do regarding something I did when I was 13 or 14 years old. I engaged in some sexual activities with my best friends younger brother who was maybe 9 or 10 at the time. It included us lightly penetrating each other with acts as fellatio. This happened 1-2 times a month for a period of 3–4 months and after that me and my family shifted out of the country. We both engaged in these act when I would go over to my friends house for a sleepover where me and his younger brother would share a bed since there weren’t any extra beds in their apartment. I remember asking him to join me in these activities, where he willing accepted as we both were interested in these topics, we were both not at the right age to make a wiser choice. I never forced or assaulted him into doing theses things with me, but I did initiate them, with him only complying in return. But this does not justify my actions  
  
It’s been 4–5 years and not a day goes by when I haven’t regretted what I did with him. The guilt and regret tears me up inside to a point where I thought to end myself. But I realized that would not undo any of the damage I’ve caused upon the child.  
  
His parents and mine are good family friends and very close, and when they help me or my family out here and there, this issue gets brought up in mind and it destroys me, leaving me in guilt and self hate for days at a time. And in the past few months its been coming up more often.  
  
I’ve seriously thought about telling my parents or his parents but that would cause a rift between our families and cause serious issues. Even though I have come close to involving an adult in the past,I always ended up backing out since I lacked the courage to face what I’ve done.  
  
At this point I don’t know what to do or how to make amendments to the kid.  
  
I’ll accept any form of help any user has to offer.  
  
I plan on making amendments by openly talking about the issue with him and seeking forgiveness but I’m not sure if its the right course of action.

"This is more serious than anyone on this Reddit can really deal with. The truth is that it was to a degree you taking advantage of him. Even if he said yes, bruh he was 9 yknow? I know you were young too but still older and I think deep down you would have known back then that it was still bad. For instance, you wouldn’t have done that with anyone else so why him? Because it was an easy “target” to put it that way.

I say all this because this is part of how you try and do what you can to make the situation better for the kid. You need to acknowledge these things to him and make sure he knows you are taking responsibility for what you initiated. I know you know it’s wrong and all that and it’s a good thing you’re doing this.

I guess the first thing I would do is say something to him, and explain why you’re sorry, what you take responsibility for, how it makes you feel, what you feel about the potential effect on him, etc. but at the same time idk he’s still so young idk what the best action would be. Like obv the best action would be to tell a parent but I know you have to make that decision on your own. If not that, and again that’s prob the right thing to do, then yeah I guess if you have a way to communicate with him then you can try… have you interacted with him at all since you moved? Almost sounds like you haven’t. So it’s a bit weird because maybe he doesn’t want to have to interact with you or something? But personally if I had to make a guess I think it would be worth trying.

Maybe start out with something like “is it okay if we talk? I want to try and explain some stuff to you from when we lived in X” something like that asking for his permission to even have that convo and if he says ok then be real and take responsibility etc. yes you were young so that’s relevant but he was even younger… like whatever you knew basically you have to imagine he knew so much less so that’s very serious. gl and I hope it works out for him."

This is in context of things I've (24) done in the past that I feel bad for: I've tried to limit my contact to a select few people who haven't been judgmental of me over it. While that's going on, I still have this going on/reflecting back on it and if what I've done truly makes me irredeemable/a bad person. So, my level of fearing rejection (which is as well as isn't related) is sky high too and that keeps being a problem (having a level of anticipation for thinking that it'll all eventually end so it's better to have a level of detachment despite also wishing that I could just let go without worrying about what may come of it if I were to be more vulnerable/attached). I know that the majority of my issues if not all of them are just symptoms of a bigger and recurring problem: being traumatized throughout the course of my life without my environment changing by much since I'm still in the same town living with most of the same people despite trying to leave.	diss-is-a-throwaway	post	26.19922862256791	male	White	0.9851095676422119	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth

So you made some horrible mistakes in the past and that because of them nobody else will love you, you can't even forgive yourself for them and you're still punishing yourself for them? Well that sucks...  
  
The good news is: **Your past has no control over you.**  
  
What happened in your past triggered the beliefs and thoughts that you have daily:  
  
""I'm irredeemable""  
  
""I'm a bad person""  
  
""I will never get better""  
  
""If other people knew what I'm thinking they will hate me""  
  
""I'm flawed and people will dislike me / I will always be alone""  
  
As you can see, it's not your past what's triggering you, it's actually your own thoughts about yourself (right now, today!)  
  
\- **Our Thoughts affect our mood**: What we think is what we feel, if you spend all day thinking bad things about yourself then you will feel bad!  
  
Constantly remembering about your past mistakes and thinking negatively about yourself is the equivalent of eating rotten fruit: ***It doesn't matter who sold that to you in the past, the problem is that you are still eating it!***  
  
All those thoughts that you have, you gotta ask yourself:  
**Are they actually true?**  
**How useful are them?**  
  
If you assume something is true without asking yourself if that is true to begin with then you will feel terrible all day. Not only that, this internal dialogue **even if true is not useful**, and consuming that daily will only make your mood worse.

This is like when you get a compliment and think *""The person wants something from me / They say this because they feel sorry for me / This is fake""* as you can see the other person gave you something beautiful, but you believing in your own thoughts without questioning turned it into something negative.  
  
\- Our **Activities affect our self steem too**: It's important to have different areas in your life that make you feel happy, constantly trying to improve our lives by removing those friends/activities that makes us feel bad.  
  
\+ Exercise / Sports  
  
\+ Hobbies  
  
\+ Friends / Love/ Family  
  
\+ Working or Studying  
  
\+ Having long term projects in our life by yourself , etc.  


If you learn how to be Assertive in your relationships and let go of toxic people, you may find an empty space in your life to fill: This is where activities and new people come in!  
  
You gotta question your thoughts, spread out your activities and work on yourself!"	diss-is-a-throwaway	reply	na	na	na	0.9851095676422119	weak	no	strong	na	MentalHealth
"College student, architecture, 22M, Latin America

To earn our bachelor's we're required to write a thesis. I'm in the investigation phase of mine and it's taken a pretty heavy toll on me. To do this we go through 3 sequential different courses over the course of 6 semesters (1 year and a half). The course has 2 professors and one is an architecture snob and a die-hard academic and really expects us to write a PHD-level thesis with undergrad level experience and will settle for no less. He is genuinely unfair, making up stuff that is not even in the rubric just to give you a lower grade. (Talking to anyone in my faculty's board would be a fool's endeavor as we do not have any sort of student support or services or any mechanisms any student can leverage in their favor for basically any reason)

I've been living off of little to no sleep for the past month, I have severely overworked myself this whole semester and for the past 2 weeks it's been catching up to me, 2 weeks ago I became ""paralyzed"" with my work schedule after I became aware that I might fail this class. It's a big deal because it would set me back a whole semester and that although it is technically recoverable the sheer weight of everything that I have to do to make it is just too much. There's also a luck involved because if I swear if that professor grades me one more time in any of the remaining evaluations I'm actually done no matter what I do.

For whatever reason this course is extremely back-loaded so the last quarter of the semester's workload is actually like 60% of the total work. So I need to snap out of it. I've been basically working non-stop for days I mean like 12+ hours a day + my other courses just on this stupid thesis no one will ever read.

I'm burnt out I get so little done in a day and when it's time to go to bed I stay awake for hours because my eyes are just burning from looking at a screen for hours and the knowledge that sleeping will only make the time between resting and working go by faster. At this point I'm not even emotional about it, I'm completely drained, spent, just mindlessly typing at a computer for days on end.

I NEED to work I need to get this done I can't bare another 4 months of college but my mind just doesn't let me get shit done. Is there anything I can do at all?"	zyper-51	post	18.058682589085592	female	White	0.999239444732666	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
"I'll give you some stress management advice and share ideas that as a writer I have found to be very useful.

I understand that you are pressed for time, but some of the things that are good for stress take no time at all. One of the best is the habit of responding to a moment of stress by breathing slowly. Doctors recommend breathing gently through the nose, 6 sec in and 6 sec out.

Taking a bit of time to relax with slow breathing is good. As little as 5 or 10 minutes can help with stress, and relaxation is important in creativity. I'll say more about that.

This comment gives you details about dealing with stress -

[https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/12wa6r5/comment/jhemi2s/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/12wa6r5/comment/jhemi2s/?context=3)

A famous science named Helmholtz said that solutions to the problems he was working on usually came to him while he was going for a walk. This is interesting in two ways. Psychologists say that we are most creative when we're relaxed. Also, Helmholtz was using a division of labor - he studied a problem at home and found solutions outdoors.

Think about a division of labor. When you're looking for an idea, don't do it at your desk. Lie down, go for a walk, take a shower, or whatever your idea zone is. Use the desk for writing text.

The morning is special, the time when out mental strength and creativity is greatest.

One of the most interesting things I know about this is a New York Times article ""What's All This About Journaling?"" The author of the Times article says that she has been very happy using the approach to journaling recommended by self-help author Julia Cameron, which is writing three longhand, stream of consciousness pages right after waking up. Stream of consciousness - just writing whatever pops into your head at the moment. The Times author said that this is therapeutic and helps her with solving problems.

A book on public speaking has a fantastic remedy for writer's block. It says that this is better than writing an outline. Spend an hour writing questions the audience might ask about the topic, as many as 50. Put them away and write answers later. This gives you a lot of text to work with. This may be the best advice I can give you.

OK, people won't read your thesis but it will make you an expert on the topic and a scholar."	zyper-51	reply	na	na	na	0.999239444732666	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealth
"And i mean REAL MESSY. Example: i had a chance to live alone for 2 month. In span of those 2 month..

my kitchen was cleaned when i was cooking dinner, leaving after-dinner mess till another day.

When i had mental strength (rarely), or days off, i was cleaning and doing laundry, but it was once a week. I might've been tired from studying and working at the same time, but there was also times where i was perfectly rested and had no strenth to clean.

I was coming from work, closed the door, unwore all of the clothers and toss it on the floor till the next laundry. I had a chair and lots of drawers, but who need those, am i right? 

In the end, i did laundary when i had almost nothing to wear.

It's kinda circumstantial, but i was always forgetting to flush the toilet, cuz i had only one flush in 4-6 hours due to electricity shortage, so it developed into a habit. 

I had two beds - a simple mattress near radiator and a couch-transformer. A simeple matress was my ""depressed bed"", cuz when i had no will to make the second bed, i was sleeping in the sad bed. I often caught colds, cuz it was low on the floor. Again, due to weekly cleaning, i was sleeping in a comfy bed at least on day a week, cuz the flat sheet is messed - I'm outta to sad bed.

In general, i have little cleaning skills, besides dusting, moping, vacuuming and laundary. Meaning i learned that you have to clean and take care of bathtub, shower, fridge/freezer etc. quite recently (age 16 maybe? 18 currently).

My mom tells me noone will ever give me a chance to rent an appartment for a long time, cuz I ""became lazy"". Idk, I'm trying, if i wouldn't, the flat would be disaster. Should i notify my future landlord i have mental issues, but will try my best; or don't mention it?"	RedMasker	post	22.23440727066096	female	White	0.9953821301460266	na	na	na	6	MentalHealth

"Don’t tell your landlord anything about messiness or mental health issues. Mess is fine (damage is not cool, so don’t do that). 

Honesty, this Sounds like me right now and I’m much older. 


I’m adhd and messy. It took a long time to learn how to clean and maintain an apartment… and it takes time and effort to continue to do that every week. 

Everything just started slipping recently when I got depressed, and now everything is a complete mess. I cleaned a little today and felt a lot better.

But I still couldn’t let anyone over to hangout, I’d be too ashamed. Pretty sure the landlord won’t kick me out, but also not sure they would be thrilled.

So, in the coming days I plan to get to an acceptable mess that would allow some friends over. That is the new goal, try to leave the place in just an okay enough state I can invite friends over on the fly."	RedMasker	reply	na	na	na	0.9953821301460266	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealth

"To my standards, that isn't ""really messy"", that is quite the norm, or better than a lot of people, better than me for sure. I have an ARMHS worker who helps me figure out routines and cleaning, and I've made a lot of progress and my apartment is well kept and organized now, but it still gets messy. 

However, I will say that yes, a landlord can evict you for being *truly messy, especially if it damages property.* This does not seem anywhere near that. I had a complaint from my neighbor because my apartment smelled bad shortly after I moved in and before I got the hang of cleaning (I grew up in a hoarding house until I was 27, so it was a learning curve for me), and they had an inspection and then gave me a certain amount of time to clean it up, and then they reinspected and it was all fine. My mom works in housing and she has had lots of clients be evicted due to hoards/bugs/damage to property.

"First of all, dont kill yourself. It is a permanent solution for a problem that is not.
Second of all, social anxiety is hell, I feel you. But to fix it you NEED to go to therapy (or just be some god that can fix everything, Im gonna assume you are not).
It will be hard on you because of your anxiety but the first step is yours, I cant help you with that. 
But when you step into that office or whatever is the place with a therapist called (English is not my first language as you can see) you will start to make progress in whatever tempo makes you feel good 
It can be once a month, a year or even every other day.
But whatever the tempo is you will be getting results.

"We hung out for the first time in 10 years. She basically confessed while catching up, that her and her bf go to a methadone clinic daily. I felt stupid not knowing what this meant. She explained and didn't say it directly but I figured out that she does drugs like m.e.t.h. very often. Obviously why she goes to that clinic. This means they are trying to get clean? She me this guy while they were both homeless. While living in her car next to his sidewalk tent. They just moved into her moms' back house. She has a 5 yr old daughter from another man who was her fiance and he overdosed. I believe the baby has always lived with her mom the grandma or has most her life. She carries around this small bag for her pipe, drugs, cigs, and Narcan shots (prob cause of how her fiance died) as she also mentioned how she often saves others' lives. Throwing them in the shower when everyone is drugged out and freaking out. She is very knowledgeable about it all and wants to be an EMT one day. 

I feel wrong being hesitant about continuing to see her cause I would have been homeless too this last year or so, if not for my parents supporting me, and I do not lead a sober life. I was living in my own apartment and she has at some point too in college and over the years since, but we both struggle a lot with mental health. I had a breakdown last year after lifelong abuse from my parents and others. (Pretty ironic how now they are the reason I'm getting better).

  
We are the same age. I met her at this private high school. Junior year I transferred to anotherl and we lost touch but we'd still hang sometimes. My mom was paying lots for private school but things were so toxic/abusive at home I started rebelling and flunking classes. At this time my parents were separated. I was self harming and in therapy. We were very broke too. The last time I saw her I stole a lot of clothing and other similar things from her room. I gave everything back soon after but am still so ashamed. That is basically when we stopped talking. Surprisingly she was not upset but it of course changed our friendship. I think I distanced myself due to being so ashamed and she just did the same. She has not brought it up since and I guess has forgiven me if she has kept reaching out to hang these last couple years until finally last month we made it happen.  
My dad had left my mom to care for my siblings and I alone. I think I felt that by having nice new trendy clothes and stuff that I would feel better overall and be able to ""keep up"" with others at this private school we were at. There were def other kids of color like me who were receiving financial aid but even they had extra money for nice/new clothing etc. or just general stuff like lunch. When I saw her it was really fun and we remembered why we were such great close friends but I did hit her pipe that night. I have experimented with drugs before and still do but I am a huge light weight. I do not do anything daily but I do party with friends sometimes. She mentions her other friends a lot (we are constantly texting/calling/making plans for next time) who also go to the clinic and who she is often hanging out with late night. I notice some friends are nurses or others who don't seem to be addicts but I have no idea. I party/hang with my friends late night too, even on weekdays how she does, but I actually have been distancing myself so that I can get my shit together and move out and/or get a full time job again. Nonetheless her and I both said how it seems we are both kind of at rock bottom and could use a good friend. I do have a best friend thats been there for me but she is 27 and we are starting to grow apart for various reasons. 

Maybe it is possible to remain friends with everyone but just with new boundaries? Am I in the wrong here altogether?"	PerformerSmart9941	post	24.08029217448273	male	White	0.006872315425425768	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth

"Hi guys,

I’m currently on holiday with my partner of 3 years we are in the Caribbean which I guess you would say should be a paradise where you switch off and relax forget all your problems and enjoy your holiday right? Only I feel I’m not able to do that and it is reflecting on his mood and the holiday. A few months before we came on holiday I was diagnosed with ‘clinical depression’ you guys may know more about this than me as I have chosen not to research it etc as I don’t want that to define me or people to think I am using this as an excuse for my behaviour because I really am not. However I am finding it hard to just be able to switch off and fully relax. When asking my partner what I am doing for him to notice this he has explained my moods have been a rollercoaster I have been crying quite often and over silly things which I think is annoying j because we are on holiday why am I crying I should be happy and greatful that I am on this beautiful island. But it’s just not as easy as that as some of you may know. I don’t feel as though I have been snappy but my moods have fluctuated for sure throughout and this could be over anything small such as ‘going to the bar and me thinking we’re going to get food and he says just drinks’ and then I kinda get into a mood about it. The way he explained it to me is that I’m like a child on holiday meaning when you take a child on holiday they don’t understand how lucky they are etc as they are young so they will have tantrums throughout the holiday and mood swings etc. 

It’s just really getting me down because I don’t think he and other people really understand that I hate being me for these reasons above j wish I could just switch off and enjoy the moment and be in the moment but I don’t seem to be able to do that. I don’t want to ruin the holiday for him we have one week left and I feel like the whole holiday that is all I have done. Please if anyone has any tips for me or has experienced this please let me know because I’m at my witts ends right now where I know he probably hates me and doesn’t even want to spend time with me or be on holiday with me.

"Hello!

So you're having mood swings because you are constantly thinking negative things about yourself and then feel guilty about feeling like this because ""You shouldn't feel this way""... Then you feel like you are ruining your boyfriend's holiday and feel even more guilty, making you feel terrible about yourself, making you more depressed?

The problem is simple: You feel bad BECAUSE you think this way. For example you tell yourself things like:  
  
*""I shouldn't feel like this""*  
  
*""I'm ruining his holiday""*  
  
*""He will leave me because I'm such a child""*  
  
*""I will never be happy""*  
  
*""I'm flawed and people will dislike me / I will always end up alone""*  
  
As you can see your own thoughts about yourself that are the cause of your low self-esteem.  
  
\- **Our Thoughts affect our mood**: What we think is what we feel, if you spend all day thinking bad things about yourself then you will feel bad! Think about this as a **Parrot** that is constantly repeating stuff without understanding it, that's basically our brain!  
  
Constantly blaming yourself because ""You shouldn't feel sad"" and thinking negatively about yourself is the equivalent of eating rotten fruit: **It doesn't matter who sold that to you in the past, the problem is that you are still eating it!**

\+ Working or Studying  
  
\+ Having long term projects in our life by yourself , etc.  
  
If you learn to recognise this thoughts as they appear and QUESTION THEM, you will see how much your mood starts to improve: Your mood is swinging wildly because you are thinking wild stuff *(""Oh he's talking to that girl? He's going to leave me because I'm not beautiful enough and he's tired of me, I'm such a failure I should end myself"")*

Just take a deep breath and talk this stuff out with your boyfriend, you will start to see how off your assumptions can be. Don't just blindly believe what the Parrot tells you, talk to yourself in a more compassionate tone and you will see how quickly your mood shifts.

"TW: sensitive subjects. 

good friend's mother passed. mom walked in balling telling me the news. took 1 month to actually get upset about it. broke down. -- middle school

my uncle passed, took 2 months to feel sad. fell on the floor and balled. -- late highschool

took 9 months to realize i had been raped by my ex. broke down fell into a deep depression and hurt myself. -- highschool to adulthood

took 2 years to cry about my 3 year old sister leaving. bio mom took her and vanished. no goodbye. all of a sudden it hit me and i went into a terrible depressive state for months. hurting myself and crying. -- highschool

took about 5 years to realize how terrible my bio mom was (before the sister insistent). -- middle school to highschool 

when in stressful situations i sometimes get really happy and lowkey manic too. heated arguments? i'll laugh. then i'll feel really happy for a while then after that rush wears off i'll get depressed. i chuckled when my mom revealed the news abt my friend's mother passing. this really comes off terribly to others. 

it really sucks. i'm unable to get therapy at this time. anytime i post here that's mostly what people say when i talk abt stuff. this is something i haven't brought up tho. and would like to try and understand it more. 

why may i be acting this way? and what can i do to become normal again?

"first off the ""chuckling in response to things that should definitely not be chuckled at"" is a fairly well-known stress response in humans, you can get people laughing inappropriately during just about *anything* stressful, from interrogations to being told a loved one has died. it's unfair to pick on someone for that, but i would chalk that up to people being emotional and not really in a state of mind to be understanding of strange human coping mechanisms.

as for the rest of it, people do process things differently and that's entirely valid, but the *cause* for such long delays is often rooted in trauma that brings about an inability to process your emotions correctly (which might also line up with your mania during arguments and depression afterwards.) you mentioned your biological mother was terrible, and that it's taken time for you to realize other events were traumatic, so i would confidently bet on there being *something* that's changed your ability to process your emotions, whether you remember it or not.

without access to therapy, all you can really do is try to self reflect on your past and question the sources of behaviors, as well as do your own research on delayed emotional responses. but in the meantime, try not to see it as something wrong with you that needs to be fixed so you can be ""normal"". it's simply who you are, how your brain has wired itself to deal with stress and trauma, it's not a conscious choice that you're making- and honestly your family should simply be supportive of you when the impact of events *does* hit. it's equivalent to you being supportive of them when the impact hits them, it's just that it hits them much earlier."

"Have been experiencing burnout from work with increased anxiety the last month or so. Work has been very supportive thankfully (my boss is the one who told me to take some time off following a traumatic experience at work - I'm a health care worker who works with organ & tissue donors). I'm so grateful for work's support and am slowly going through the process of getting back to work but trying not to be like I was before and jumping into everything.
Also currently on week two of increasing anxiety/OCD medication dose and I know that comes with increased mood swings, anxiety, nausea etc, so trying to ride that out as well until that helps. And am going to therapy which I know will help, but haven't got a session for another few days.

"Anxiety and OCD have a really high success rate in therapy (CBT being the main one), once you learn how your mind works you will start to see changes in both at the same time. 

Medications may stop being necessary after some months of therapy and if you understand how the process works you will be able to apply the techniques by yourself to feel good.

"I've been seeing him for about 2 years now and things have been going okay I guess? he diagnosed me with depression, anxiety, ptsd, bpd and adhd. got me on the right meds and I'm feeling good. the weird thing is he's super concerned about my sex lif and that im not having enough of it. every visit he asks about how it's going. obviously antidepressants lower libido and I'm asexual so I'm not having a lot of it which has never been a problem in my relationship. but he's so concerned about it especially my husband's ""well being"" my husband knew I was asexual when he married me and it has never been a problem.

but my psych keeps saying what I'm feeling isn't normal and he keeps trying to put me on meds that raise my libido (they don't work anyway). is this normal? should I seek out a different psychologists? it honestly makes me feel so uncomfortable but getting into a psych is so hard I don't want to lose access to my meds."	frooploot2	post	40.13929099664537	female	White	0.012849145568907261	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth

"Most of my life growing up was one that involved a lot of moving, followed by a 6 year period of a proper social life, to me dropping out of high school and losing all contact with anyone my age. For a good 8 years after that I spent most of my time alone, depressed and wondering if I would ever have a social life again.

I now see myself constantly avoiding any kind of difficult situation, reacting far too emotionally to things.  I feel like I've internalised a lot of terrible attitudes and behaviours over the years that relate to being fearful of rejection.

I really don't feel comfortable with myself in a lot of ways. 

I've started therapy and the guy has been super helpful so far. Had a few emotional sessions but today was the first time he has started me down a certain path: acceptance and commitment therapy. I've not heard of this before so am wondering if any of you have experience with this? The way it's described seems very useful and the issues it seems to be tackling are exactly what I struggle with.

"Hi Everyone,

So I have a younger brother that is schizoaffective. For those that aren't familiar - it means he has a combination of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia (at least in his case - I believe it can mean additional symptoms as well or a different combination of them). It's been a long journey and he is now 29 and living on the streets.

Without getting too much into the weeds here... he currently believes he is married to a singer and that she is trying to get him from Los Angeles out to New York to live with her. He's had this idea before and I've always tried to reason with him that it isn't real or at times - went along with it just so I could spend time with him.

He called me this morning out of the blue to have lunch and I met him. While there we had some catching up conversations and I took him out for lunch. After we ordered the food and sat down, he started talking to me about how he needs $2,000 for the ""corporation"" the singer works for so that he can be picked up by her management team and flown out to her. I thought this was him trying to trick me into giving him money at first (because he has done this before)... but it turns out he's been talking to some people and he showed me all of the text messages he's made. 

There must have been 4 months of conversation that he let me scroll through of back and forth between him and his ""wife""... where half the time she is asking for money and he sends her the minimal amount that he has (my dad or myself give him $20-30 a day to help him out). He has probably given her all of the money we've been sending him over the last half a year...

I'm not upset seeing this - because he really believes he's in love with her and that this is a real thing. It breaks my fucking heart. He pays on CASHAPP or other untraceable transaction apps and doesn't question it. In fact when I question it - he gets upset.

After speaking with him about this for a while I told him that if he could prove to me that it's a real corporation - that I would pay the money he needs to get to his wife. I told him to let me call them, but they don't accept phone calls. Only texts. So I asked for them to text me or for the number so I could text them, and they only said he could send me an email. SO - I have the email.

I won't go into the weeds of it... but he's had accidents before that have put him on disability. He could be receiving money from the government for disability but he's saying the people he's talking to have told him NOT to accept the disability money or let himself be put on disability... 

The amount he was offered could at least keep him off the streets - so it's super sad to see him living this sort of life just because these people are telling him to. 

The question is... now what do I do? This is clearly a scam that has been influencing my brother's life. 

Anybody know any organizations that can track down scams like this? Report it to the police? I just dropped him off and I can't stand the thought of him believing in this and getting his heart broken down the line. It is legitimately dangerous with his conditions. 

&#x200B;

I know I kept saying ""not getting into the weeds of it"" but I could probably elaborate on this story and type 100 times what I have above... sorry for the lengthy post. Also sorry for typos - I don't have the energy right now. 

&#x200B;

TLDR; My brother has mental health problems. He believes he's married to a singer that is asking him for money and he is paying it. I got their email - need help catching these assholes so my brother doesn't keep sending them money and getting his heart broken.

"So I just moved and started a new job.  It has been very stressful and overall just not going great. I had an interview for a better position in the company yesterday and was excited.  But about two hours before work I started feeling dizzy and nauseous. I might have been able to push through but just did not feel like I could. I also have a MRSA infection in my nose. I faked a fever and slept all day. I had to reschedule my interview. I have had to leave early twice before and now this.  I've only worked there a month. This is a pattern for when I get depressed. I'm desperately trying to get ahold of my doctor to see if I can up my antidepressants. I told my boss I would be back tomorrow and for some reason she got confused and thought I would be back today so now she is irritated. Even though she told me I can't come back without a doctor's note? Anyways I feel awful and it's actually making me feel sick. I normally pride myself on being a good employee expect for when this happens. I need to hear your stories or thoughts because I feel like a shitty worker. I come from a family of workers who don't really take time off so I had to lie to them as well and I feel awful about it.

"I understand your situation. To be honest the only thing I can say is that it is common with people who are chronically depressed. If they're allowed the excuse they will use it, and shelter in their cocoon.

I've heard good things about getting jobs in which doing this would be so dangerous and threatening to someone you are responsible for, that you are consciously forced to go to work and muddle through.

"I would say that it is ok to feel bad that you lied, but at the same time you need to practice having confidence in yourself and your decisions.  You made a determination that you would not be functional at work so you stayed home.  Have confidence that when you go back, you will be doing a better job than you would have if you forced yourself to go when you were unwell.  EVEN if you go back and it seems hard, have confidence you made a good decision and are capable of doing good work and making more good decisions.  You don't want to miss too much work,  sure.  You want to be reliable, sure.  But everyone needs a day off now and then.

Try to have some confidence that you are a good worker and when you get back, keep practicing that confidence.  If you do, you will find that you are able to do an ok job even on bad days because you have confidence you are doing your best and that your best is absolutely good enough.

"I haven't been formally diagnosed yet, but after doing extensive research about BPD, I feel I have it. My therapist was in the process of evaluating me when I ended up losing them due to moving. 

Anyways, on to the topic at hand. 

Today, someone who I felt extremely close to hurt me so bad that I’m in a rage. Like, burn a gift I got them kinda rage.

Without going into details, we had conversations in the past that should certain events occur, I would be helping them with a task. Today, based on a comment made on social media, I found out apparently they got someone else and never bothered to tell me. When I asked about it, they nonchalantly told me ""yeah X person is doing that."" I responded with a sad face and ""ok"" and no response was given to that. 

This whole thing that I feel might actually be minor, has turned my entire day upside down and now I feel like I can't trust them at all anymore and I want nothing to do with them.

If you do have BPD then it about you not being able to control your emotions, the main problem with BPD. You took your friend's action way too personally (again if you have BPD this is common behaviour), and reacted way too strongly. Its good that you are aware of it at least cause that's the first step. The second (longer) step is to treat it, for me it was DBT.	3fluffypotatoes	reply	na	na	na	0.9992177486419678	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealth
"I (23F) really hate that I feel this way. I can't even take a proper break or relax without feeling I should be doing something during the day, or doing something more with my life etc. 
For some reason, without me wanting it to, my self worth and self esteem etc has become tied with my productivity. And by productivity I mean in terms of employment. I realised this first when I just graduated and wanted a small break before looking for jobs. During that time I couldn't even enjoy my break because soon I started feeling so absolutely shitty. Most of my time was spent trying to deal with that. I felt behind from others, like I hadn't really done much with my life, like a loser. Even though I understand this may not be the reality, nevertheless I feel this way. It's very frustrating when your brain can think one way but you feel another. I think I automatically tend to compare and try to meet ""societal standards"" etc and then feel shitty when I don't meet them, for example when I'm unemployed. I started feeling different when I got a job. However, I've noticed it again for the second time since I'm currently unemployed. I realise this time around to a greater impact just how persistent this way of feeling is. And I really need to address it. Because I can't even take time of to enjoy what I like to do/or relax etc, without these feelings coming up. I feel like I'm behind, or I feel I'm losing time etc etc.
At the same time I know that not all that I think may even be true. Yet I can't be happy with my accomplishments etc truly and I think that's because I tend to compare how I am to how I should be. I'm trying to practice more acceptance etc. But sometimes I feel really so low about myself."	_sisterofthemoon_	post	18.805717538679126	female	White	0.998145341873169	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
"I'm not saying that one of these comments is necessarily all you need, but I'll share these observations.  
  
First, there's the obvious fact that we all hate boredom. We need things to do in order to be happy. Also, being active is a coping method for many people. I hear people say that keeping busy is how they deal with anxiety.  
  
Rest is part of our work in the sense that stopping at a gas station is a part of driving. We need proper rest to do our jobs well.  
  
Maybe it would help if I offered you some good advice for how to relax, but the best thing for you might be getting professional help.  
  
Psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg, who have published 6 papers on breathing and mental health, recommend a 3-part program of mind-body methods - breathing, meditation, and slow body movement.

"\-I've been having extreme paranoia surrounding the government, 1984 stuff. But, like, I genuinely believe it is something to be concerned about. Whether I'm feeling normal, depressed or crazy. But this is next level, kind of ruining my life, I feel I have to whisper everywhere, cover cameras, I'm paranoid my TV is watching me (well, the people looking through the TVs camera) and all that.

\-I'm too paranoid to take medication, too much big Pharma shit. Plus Canada is well known for experimenting on their citizens, who's to say they're not still doing it. 

\-I feel my thoughts are incredibly jumbled. I don't know, like I've been writing better than I ever have but its SO much and so jumbled, and one topic to the next, to the next, not being able to finish things because I rambled too much on one thing. And confusing, I'm trying my best to keep it together for the post, but I've been writing letter and they turn out 10 pages long of just, re-written stuff, and side-notes and jumbled thoughts, etc. 

\-Every fucking thing I try and interpret as a spiritual sign. Numbers, clouds, songs, people, dogs. I don't know, I just need guidance and help and I have literally no one so I hope God shows me a sign but he never does. The religious cyclone going on in my head is making me sick. 

\-I feel no one cares, absolutely no one. And if they do its solely for selfish purposes. I've been battling severe anorexia and nobody expects anything of you when you're dying, but the moment you gain 10lbs and look healthy again its ""well what's wrong with you get on with life. Listen to me."" Counsellors have re-traumatized me, been completely unhelpful, and I've been through a few. Friends who say they care are simply text friends. I knew them in school, but 7 years later and we text off and on, maybe see eachother in public once in a blue moon and pretend like nothings happened, plan to hang out, and nothing. I'm partially responsible, when someone does follow up usually I dont feel well enough to leave my house. And I'd invite them over but my house is a mess. So repeat the cycle. I want help, but nobody listens. The ONE person who could help, is my first best friend, them boyfriend, then ex, now best friend and roommate and we have a lot of complicated history which has just led to complacency. He watched me slowly die and didnt say a thing, and as I feel I'm losing my mind, hes still not saying anything. So, even the ONE person I can talk to about this stuff never does anything to help. And its making me lose my mind, because I get upset with him. And I shouldn't.

\-I'm scared to drive, I cant make myself slow down, I have do many speeding tickets, lost my license for a month and still cant all down, have a court date for a ticket (it actually wasn't my fault, not this time! lol but the putting it off has been)

\-Nothings helping anymore. No weed, no alcohol, no tramadol. I had a break from clonazepam for a while and I recently started taking it again and thats been nice. But I keep smoking and drinking more and more hoping something will help. 

\-Ive lost all hope. Im scared to die but find comfort in it as well. I want this to end, I want it to be over with. I'm not a low enough BMI yet where I'll die, but I'm hell-bent on getting there. I'm scared, but I think its what's best for me.

\-I've been drinking, abusing meds, starving, smoking and all that fun stuff so much more recently, I was on track to quit and just. I don't know, just like that I lost hope. And I just want it over with. I have no one to help, no one in medical positions ACTUALLY cares, its just their jobs, I dont want to burden anyone, my family is complicated and I dont think I can let them in anymore. I think the door for that closed, and I'm sad about that, but I've been without ""parents"" for too long and have learned to live that way. With parents who I emotionally take care of, and financially support me. We love eachother, we know its complicated, even though it all goes unsaid. But you dont need to say it to know. And I think I think I'm ready to be done. I feel bad for them losing a kid, but, if we can talk about it before I die, come to agreements, forgive eachother and talk, laugh, reminisce, and just come to the understanding that my emotional torment and financial burden isn't worth a life, its like cancer of the brain. Nobody would expect someone actively dying, and slowly, to stay alive just to keep them happy. Its torture. So maybe it would be okay. I wouldn't kill myself until I had everything in order and felt like things have been resolved. 

\-Should mention I deal with severe and enduring anorexia, and I just dont see a way out. And I dont know if I want one anymore. it scares me, but I think its easier. I've been losing a lot of my ""recovery weight"" recently, and fast, and suffering the physical and mental effects of it. So maybe thats contributing. I don't know if that can cause psychosis or if its just malnourishment, but I still want it over with. I know its only been 3 years of the struggle, since it got life threatening anyways, but I want it over with.

       I used to be very strictly anti meds, and like you, thought that I could handle everything on my own, self medicating with alcohol and street drugs.  Getting on bipolar meds was one of the best things I’ve done for myself though.  It made me realize how much more damaging the alcohol/self medicating was.  You can research how the medications work, most of them can be demonstrated clinically to work.  For instance, antipsychotics are very effective, on record, for stopping psychosis.   Some antipsychotics like seroquel also increase appetite.  Most people find that those meds do what they were trying to achieve with the drugs and alcohol, only it actually works.  It calms you down.  It stops obsessive thought cycles.  It helps you regulate moods and regain control of your behavior.  They work by, for example, blocking neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine activity to bring them down to normal levels.  For instance, schizophrenics tend to have greatly increased levels of dopamine, which is connected to schizophrenic psychosis.  Mania in bipolar people is often tied to both higher dopamine and serotonin, so these meds really help.

I understand the fear of medicine, but if you want to get better you’re going to have to admit to yourself that what you’re doing now isn’t working, and open yourself up to new possibilities.  For me, I thought the meds would turn me into a dissociated zombie, but in reality they just made me normal and more content.  I think the self destructive part of my ego was trying to preserve itself.  Different parts of our psyches often take measures to protect themselves, and my self destructive side used fear to keep me from getting the medicine I needed to get better.  

You are incredibly lucky to live in a wealthy country with free healthcare, it would be so easy for you to get help with these problems.  Government institutions have done plenty of sinister things, but they are ultimately just interested in preserving or expanding themselves.  You could go to a doctor and request a specific antipsychotic you’ve researched, and they either prescribe you or don’t.  No room for them to experiment on you.  Please think about it, there is at least a chance that something this east could solve many of your problems"	1f_ckdperson	reply	na	na	na	0.998936116695404	weak	strong	strong	na	MentalHealth
"when we were first dating, it was a fucking MESS. two weeks before we met, i was SA’ed. i should’ve gotten therapy instead of a relationship, but my brain was completely numb. and he was trying to move on from his ex who he had broken up 3 weeks before we met

i told him about the assault and he made a joke, but said that we could work through it together, but i kept reiterating that i should get therapy before we dated cause i myself didn’t know how to handle this trauma let alone share it with someone else, but he was set on working through it together 

i had flashbacks of the assault for a week straight. he got drunk and we got into a fight, which happened more than once, so i texted him a paragraph of how i felt while he was asleep and then blocked him. which i feel fucking horrible for, but it’s the only thing i thought of

that was 2 months ago and i unblocked him yesterday. it just felt unnecessary and just wanted to unblock him. he noticed because he texted me, we called, and i apologized and explained everything that happened and he said “i wished you stayed instead of leaving to get better,” “we could’ve worked on it together” “it’s hard to believe that you’re back because i’m scared you’re gonna leave again” “i needed you and you left”

i said, “i left your life once because i was stupid and suffering, here i am now trying to renter it because i’ve gotten help and i’m better, i want to give you the choice of letting me back into your life, but if you don’t want me, it’s okay.” and he just kept saying “i’m not gonna make you do anything you don’t want to,” “if you wanna leave then leave, just don’t say anything because i think about your text everyday” 

we go through this everytime we talk. he says the sweetest things and then we talk about painful things like this. i ask him more than once if he wants me in his life and he never answers, he just says “it’s up to you.” he’s only said he wanted me in his life twice

i genuinely feel like shit for blocking him and leaving him and i recognize that i have toxic behaviors that need to be worked on, but i feel like he’s just constantly blaming me. i was assaulted, didn’t grieve, jumped into a relationship, got scared and ran. but at the same time, he’s making me feel like shit. i was doing bad and got help for it, and he makes me feel bad for doing that

am i the asshole for what i did? is this a relationship i should stay in and work on? am i supposed to feel like this?"	aceshighma	post	14.582878649686924	female	White	0.0028778414707630873	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth

I want to apply to grad school but there’s no chance I’ll get accepted, I’ll just get tossed aside. 

I have no actual meaningful friendships. I’m just not a fun or likeable person. I’ve lost so many people in my life. They all hated me. I’m too exhausted to trust new people to form friendships. I have “friends” yet they truly don’t care about me. I’m no one’s priority.

I’m not even a genuinely good or caring person. I’m filled with so much anger, but most of it is directed at myself for being such a useless POS. The other anger is envy directed at people being happy and having fulfilling relationships. I hate that I feel this envy, I’m such a piece of crap, why can’t I just be happy for them that they don’t have to suffer the same way I’m suffering? I’m just not good.


I literally have nothing going for me. I’m just a stupid POS college student.

I’ve only been diagnosed with depression and I manage it ok I guess. However I have reoccurring thoughts that the people in my life are just making fun of me, setting me up, or have some kind of power over me that I’m not aware of like they’re in on something I’m not. I can’t exactly confront people about this without sounding crazy and intellectually I know it’s not true or at least hope so. I recently had a psychedelic experience with my gf which is something I haven’t done in 2 years and it was great but that feeling covered the entire experience and this feeling is something that has grown more obvious in my head since going into my 20’s.

"Your anxieties are certainly making you very scared… anxieties do that…. it’s a defence mechanism, but yours is running at beyond maximum so everything is seen as a threat.  Even people who are trying to help you which is what these people are doing, and why you’re seeing them in the first place. 

If you have a NEW therapist…. why do you have a new therapist?  

I can’t say this in another way, but if you keep running you’ll never get to the bottom of what happened to you and what you’re suffering.  Whatever happened to you must have been really upsetting for you to be feeling like this.  

“You” are not your mind, but “you” are strongly affected by how your mind works and if your mind has been traumatised “you” will feel that trauma in all the fears you’re going through now.

I have never experienced the level of fear you’re experiencing now, but please please please understand, your mind is lying to you because it is scared and I believe it is scared because of what’s happened in your life.  

Everyone is trying to help you, even though may not believe it, you may not be able to believe it.

"I want to preface this my saying I know this will sound ridiculous and very likely that it doesn't work for others, but holy crap this works so well for me and offers instant relief, maybe it can help someone else too.

The technique is as follows: focus on whatever anxiety you're feeling, how it feels in your body, the sensation of the panic/your nerves on edge, then instead of trying to stop feeling that, try to brute force your mind and body to feel MORE anxious as fast as possible. To be clear, I'm not saying you should think about something that will make you feel more anxious, just try and amplify that feeling without any other thoughts in your head, just by focusing on it.

I swear to god, as soon as I try and do this it's like there's some kind of failure within my system to handle this directive and within seconds, the anxiety is just GONE. Of course it can creep back later if unchecked, but it's useful when I'm feeling suddenly overwhelmed.

I thought of this method when I realised how trying to calm down makes me panic more, and wondered what effect the opposite would have.

I've been doing this for several weeks now and would love to know if it works for anyone else. Please be careful though, I don't want anyone getting in a bad way because of my advice."	slowron	post	30.18593493013536	female	White	0.001232448499649763	na	na	na	3	MentalHealth
"Find someone trained in this https://focusing.org/felt-sense/what-focusing  if you can’t do it yourself. 

Excerpt from website for those who hate clicking :

Focusing is an experiential, embodied and evidence-based practice of self-reflection. During Focusing, your attention will open up to multiple layers and aspects of living.  It’s called Focusing because it requires a special kind of “focus” to notice what is not yet clear, fuzzy and vague, implicit in how you interact with your situations and environment.  This fuzzy dimension of experience is called the “felt sense.” Focusing on the “felt sense” allows an in-depth clarification process to happen. Sometimes this leads to an amazing experience that the body is reliable in its living-forward tendency.

For some persons, Focusing is a very natural process, while others can do it only after some training.  The subtle movements experienced during a Focusing session have the potential to transforms the framework of thinking and stuck emotional patterns.  In the speed of your daily life, and in the overflow of information, Focusing is helpful to get a clearer sense for anything that matters to you among the complexities of life. The practice has been found to enhance well-being, meaning in life, and all kind of healing and creative processes. Ongoing research since the 1960s robustly demonstrated that clients who get in touch in a Focusing way with their experiential process, are more successful in psychotherapy than those who do not know this act of embodied self-reflection.

Focusing is often compared to Mindfulness, Zen and different kinds of meditations. They are related in cultivating non-judgmental attention to the “here and now” that can be felt in the body. Focusing is different from its “neighbors” because bodily felt sensing creates a space for meaning to be freshly formed. Focusing engages language more than its “neighbors”. That’s because during Focusing you use language to explicate how you experience something, and thus learn how to (re-)connect language to your ongoing experiencing body. Therefore, Focusing is considered a process that integrates feeling and thinking, body and mind.

While Focusing can be done alone, it is mostly done together with another person. Focusing goes hand in hand with a thorough-going practice to listen in a non-intervening, attentive, open-minded and open-hearted way to each other. In this respect, Focusing is a practice to generate a space for yourself and the other to allow the exploration of the felt-sense dimension of human living to happen."	slowron	reply	na	na	na	0.001232448499649763	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth
"I'd say, you're basically doing your own weird form of **mindfulness** training.

The principle is: You can't force a feeling to disappear. But you can focus on it, really feel it and let it grow as big as it needs to (without amplifying it, just giving it the room it needs) and it will disappear on its own. If you try to push the feeling or thought away forcefully, it will just come back stronger.

You can try it with just a thought that comes up. If you try to push it away, it'll stay or come back stronger. If you just let it be and focus on the present moment (what you feel, see, smell), your thought will just go away.

Works with anxiety, cravings, addiction and many other things.

Basically, I was tasked with cleaning our room. I asked my teacher for some brooms while unconsciously extending my arm, but she saw my scars (honestly, I don't hide them anymore because they're already healed and I'm already a month clean), and she snatched my arm in front of so many people and asked out loud, ""What ARE THOSE?"" I was so stunned to answer because I didn't mind my scars anymore as they healed. After I got home, she privately messaged me. At first, I thought it was just some words that could ""cheer"" me up because they were typed in caps, but after I read her whole message, she said she knew me as a discipline student and that I was the last person she expected to do such things, and she said she was very disappointed. She wasn't my favorite teacher. I don't have a favorite teacher, but hearing such words from the people I look up to because they treated me fairly hurts so much. Upon seeing my scars, I actually feel proud of myself for being able to at least heal them and be able to still survive despite certain circumstances, but now that people are doing those acts towards me, I can only feel nothing but shame and dirt towards myself.

"I have my degree in education, and that is very VERY inappropriate for the teacher. I understand if you don't want to do this, but if you think it is necessary, you could always talk to the school counselor or principal and tell them about the incident. They will likely talk to your teacher. That is 100% up to you, I don't want to make you feel pressured if you don't feel comfortable doing that.

I have no idea how the teacher thought that was acceptable. 

In my experience, having many family members and friends who are teachers, this is not normal behavior for teachers and it makes my skin crawl. At least not where I live it isn't normal.

For example, I opened up about my mental health to a teacher right before I graduated high school. I gave him a letter explaining that getting me involved in his agriculture classes essentially saved my life and gave me purpose. He was concerned, so he took me aside in private and asked if I was still feeling suicidal like I alluded to in my letter, and we had a great talk. He had my back and never made me feel embarassed. That is how it should be handled.

I know it's way easier to say than to do, but don't let that teacher make you feel ashamed. I don't know you, but I am genuinely proud that you have been clean."	_alivingavocado	reply	na	na	na	0.9984322190284729	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealth
"Hi all,

For the past year or so I've had some random thoughts about a terrible scenario that has a pretty low likelihood of occurring, yet, I can't seem to get the thought out of my head even months after getting that initial thought. I think about these everyday, multiple times, and worst of all, I start preparing for these scenarios as if they're gonna happen, which in my head isn't a dumb move at all cause what if it does?

I've been told by my friends that it won't happen and I definitely see where they're coming from, but it's as if there is a little voice in my head saying anything that can happen will happen and you must prepare. It's not really destructive but it's just kind of annoying when I have these random thoughts during the day.

Is this anxiety and should I be seeking professional help or should I just stick it out"	throwaway05121106	post	18.119636853942602	male	White	0.9887267351150513	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
"It's not dumb to consider a worst-case scenario if we're worried about something, but we should do this calmly, because that helps us to assess the likelihood of a scenario, also to assess our ability to deal with the problem.  
  
It seems that you're very troubled, so it makes sense for you to consider professional help. Remember that if you talk with a therapist, there's no commitment. You can stop seeing this person after the first visit if you like.  
  
  
 Statistics tell us what's best for people in general, not you as an individual.  
  
This article from the American Psychological Association says that most people with anxiety disorders do better with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) than with medicine.  
  
https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/medication-or-therapy#:\~:text=For%20anxiety%20disorders%2C%20cognitive%2Dbehavioral,improve%20outcomes%20from%20psychotherapy%20alone.  
  
Although self-help based on CBT has not been shown to be as effective as the standard treatments for anxiety with office visits, some people benefit from it. Authoritative Guide to Self-Help Resources in Mental Health, a book based on polls of more than 3,000 professionals, says that The Feeling Good Handbook by Dr. David Burns, a psychiatrist and cognitive therapy expert, is the one recommended most often by professionals.   
  
In recent years, there has been very encouraging evidence for therapeutic breathing, which can be combined with cognitive therapy methods for dealing with worrisome thoughts.  
  
When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.  
  
One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.  
  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.  
  
Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
Also, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.  
  
The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication.

"I have had very bad experiences with men since I was a kid, which effected me a lot more than I’d realized. One more recently where my friend assaulted me in my sleep. This extremely effected my perception of men and how I feel around them. I’m in therapy and am trying to heal but I still feel very nervous and scared around men. It isn’t too bad to the point where I can’t be around them anymore, it’s more like a lingering feeling of fight or flight and finding escape routes if I’m by a man.

Im in a friend group and have known this one guy for about a year now. He’s very kind, handsome and has always been respectful to me. I realized I had feelings for him recently and he told me he felt the same. I feel the stereotypical butterflies, warm feeling in chest and happy feeling around him. However that anxiety and fearful feeling is still around.

He’s much bigger and stronger than me. That kind of scares me a little which idk if that’s dumb. I really like him but I’m scared of the worst possible scenario and it’s making me hesitant to move forward with our relationship. I know I can’t just get over that feeling but is there anything I can do to make it dictate my actions less? I don’t want to mess things up with anxiety."

"The void hears you....

We recommend taking things slowly. If he knows about your fears good, if not, make sure he understands. Communication can bridge the divide of anxiety and fear. Set some rules or questions he should ask before, during, and after any scenario you want to think up. A good person will listen and understand. Don't feel like you should hide or bury these feelings. Instead, talk about them with yourself and him.

We often don't understand or consider the weight of ""inclusion"", the act of having someone or something added. For people being included is a powerful thing. We also recommend some simple breathing meditation and affirmations of yourself before bed. These can help reduce background and overall stress."

"I (17F) have been thinking of putting myself in a psych ward to avoid/seperate myself from my abusive mother for a short period of time. Obviously that's  not the only reason. I've struggled throught various amounts of metnal health's issues such as Bulimia, PTSD, anxiety & depression, and possibly Bipolar disorder. Both of my parents physically, psychological, and emotional abused me to the point where I saw them as people I should fear, not trust. All of my success weren't ever acknowledge unless they could brag about it and all my flaws were insulted and beaten to the ground. My dad was more violent and physical and he would yell and scream that therapy was a mistake for me when I was in middle school and he would dismiss any mental disorders my brother and I had (he also has PTSD and autism). I have been to a psych ward twice already; one when I was 11 and the other I was 12. Both times my mother took me there. The first was when I was thinking of hurting myself while the other was because I called the Hotline about my dad in my mom's home. She thought that since I called the hotline at her house that I was ""seeking attention"" and ""they'll see me as a bad  mother "" I know now that those words were outright horrible to say to a 12 year old child who's thinking of ending their life, but during that time the only person I blamed was myself. My mom was the emotional abuser for all my life. Shes kinda the main person who caused my body dsymorphia and Bulima as well as my pushover and clingy habits. She would threathen to leave me at my dads house and never come back (theyre divorced and live seperately) if I ever disobeyed . Although the first visit was kind of sad and I felt outcasted there, the second time visit made me feel somewhat open to improve while I was there. In fact, that's how I met my therapist (we'll call her Clarissa). Clarissa is a cool ass therapist and actually helped me regain confidence as well as self-esteem during our visits. However, in my sophomore year, I realized my MOM has her for my therapist. Now, my mom is very mentally ill as well and she struggles with depression from her past marriage, childhood and parents passing away. I do want her to see a tharpist. But it feels weird that it was the one I picked out. If this is normal, please let me know cuz it feels fishy to me. Fast forward  and Im finished with my junior year and living across the country and I start to experience deeper depression. I have no friends, I have no job, I have nobody but online school and my mom. She takes any opportunity to bash on the way I look, the way I act, the way I'm nothing like her, my orientation (I'm NB and very gay), and most importantly my emotions. I'm very sensitive and whenever I'm going through a strong emotion, I cry. A lot. Anger, crying. Sadness, crying. Happiness, sometimes I cry. It's the only way I can relieve my stress because any other way is also shamed on in my family. Whenever she sees me cry, she immediately says ""y'know if you're so sensitive, just go back to your dad's. I have money for a plane ticket where you can be all alone on a plane to see your dad"" the reason why we moved is to GET AWAY from my dad. So in order to not have me get kicked out, I stay quiet and wipe my tears. Just a few hours ago, I missed a therapy appointment that's was scheduled yesterday but cancelled and changed to an open appointment today. I forgot to put an alarm and book ot in my calender so I forgot to prepare myself. When my mom text me, she decided to cancel EVERY. SINGLE. APPOINTMENT. and KEEP HERS assigned. I don't plan my appointments at all. My mother does and she will only tell me last minute or AFTER I missed it unknowingly. So now the only adult  figure other than my mom who helps mentally support me in my life is out of the picture. I'm alone. I spent the last hour sobbing to my gf about the situation and she was livid that I had to go through all of this. She hated my  mom and I'm started to not see her as a mother more and more. She's threatened to kick me out and she's done that to my brother before, only to cry for a day when he left and bash  on him for it this day. So I know she'll kick me out. I just dont know when. I feel like I'll either rot in this cold place I call my apartment or I'll die on the streets. I dont know the family I have here, I have no friends here, no income, and I lost my license. If I'm ever going o get a break from my mom, a psych ward might have to be it. Or else I might just run away or something worse. I can't take it anymore"	StinkyCryptid	post	20.745431096753034	male	White	0.005080077797174454	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
"The void hears you....

We often find ourselves in places where light doesn't shine. It seems to be hard for people to not be assholes to one another, which we find odd. First, your feelings about all this, and your gf's, are valid and on point. A parent like that is worse than the dark feelings we often have about ourselves. This can be a good thing, but the perspective is off.

At 17 you can walk away from family, and find a new one or become your own. Minor Emancipation is not exactly rare, but does require you to have a plan and a job lined up. This doesn't seem like your case, but we felt we should include it.

We often recommend meditation and personal affirmations before bed to help with stress and anxiety. This is no solution, but might help in small ways, and each step is helpful here. That she cancels your appointments is quite interesting and a right @*%*@>#*÷ move, yet you might be able to take control of such things with some knowledge.

In the end we are here to listen and suggest. The void isn't a cure nor a place to escape. Troubles follow within your heart and mind, and it is something that requires time, love, and space to close. We are always here to listen, you are not alone."

"Firstly, Trigger Warning, I’ll be mentioning abuse but not in detail. 

I, 21 female, was in a very bad abusive relationship with a man for two years. I’ve gotten a lot of help for it and at the end of last year he was arrested and charged for what he did to me. 

I feel like I’ve healed a lot and I’ve gone to therapy. I’ve put the time and effort into fixing myself. I waited a whole year and a half before starting a new relationship. That didn’t go well and I let my fear and triggers control me. Unfortunately I wasn’t ready yet but he wasn’t either so it didn’t work out. It was a very good learning experience for me tho. I took another 8 months to myself before starting getting into a relationship. 

My new partner is an absolute saint. She’s so patient and caring. I still have triggers and can feel panicked but I do a good job hiding it and self soothing. Im trying my hardest to not let old wounds bleed onto loved ones. But will I ever be fully healed? I hate feeling like I’m not good enough for my partner and like they deserve better. I can’t control my past or what happened to me, but I’m trying my hardest to be better. I don’t want to be a victim, I want to be a survivor. I don’t want my trama to control me but it still does some days. I’ve been told you can never get over the abuse I’ve been through, that is scars you for life. Is that true? Will it never go away? 

My biggest struggle is communicating my feelings to my partner. I just can’t talk about my feelings and every now and then I have panic attacks because I think she’s acting “off”. I can’t tell if it’s from my autism or PTSD, or a mix of both. I’m at a lost and feel like I’m failing. I don’t know what more I can do, I’m on meds for depression and have spend countless hours on a therapist couch. I no longer cry, have nightmares, or shut down completely when I’m upset but I still have triggers. If anyone has any advise it would be greatly appreciated."	atigerwithtea	post	23.49935972054501	female	White	0.004365027882158756	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
"Hello, it seems like you think that the problems of your past are what's affecting you today and are scared that you may never heal...

The good news is: ***Your past has no control over you***.

What happened in your past triggered the beliefs and thoughts that you have daily:

*""I'm not good enough for her""*

*""I'm a burden""*

*""I will never get better""*

*""If other people knew what I'm thinking they will hate me""*

*""I'm flawed and people will dislike me""*

As you can see, it's not your past what's triggering your panic, it's actually your own thoughts about yourself (right now, today!)

\- **Our Thoughts affect our mood**: What we think is what we feel, if you spend all day thinking bad things about yourself then you will feel bad!

Taking the blame for everything and thinking negatively about yourself is the equivalent of eating rotten fruit:***It doesn't matter who sold that to you in the past, the problem is that you are still eating it!***

All those thoughts that you have, you gotta ask yourself:**Are they actually true?How useful are them?**

*If you assume something is true without asking yourself if that is true to begin with then you will feel terrible all day. Not only that, this internal dialogue even if true is not useful, and consuming that daily without questioning it will only make your mood worse.*

\- Our **Activities** affect our self steem too: It's important to have different areas in your life that make you feel happy, *not be emotionally dependant on one area (for example your girlfriend)*

\+ *Exercise / Sports*

*+ Hobbies*

*+ Friends / Love/ Family*

*+ Working or Studying*

*+ Having long term projects in our life by yourself , etc.*

The key is to not obsess over one area and spend all your resources there because your SELF STEEM will depend on that thing only (relationship) and you will feel empty, depressed and suicidal when that doesn't work out.This ***emotional dependency*** is the reason why sometimes you may stay in abusive relationships knowing it's bad for you: It's all you had. Literally. All your life, every hour of the day was focused on that relationship.

You gotta question your thoughts, spread out your activities and work on yourself first!"	atigerwithtea	reply	na	na	na	0.004365027882158756	weak	no	strong	na	MentalHealth

"So when I got with my fiancé he had two best friends, Garret and Drake. Garret has a girlfriend that never liked me for whatever reason. One day she commented on my Facebook post just absolutely bullying me, called me “fucking weird” said I’m ruining the friendship group they had before I showed up, stuff like that. She even got two of her friends who I’ve never even met before to start bullying me. Just randomly out of nowhere. Anyway my fiancé backed me up and we stopped being friends with Garret. My fiancé told Drake that we could still be friends but not if he keeps hanging out with garrets girlfriend and her friends because we don’t want to be associated with the kinds of people who think it’s ok to just put people down. For reference Drake hangs out with her and the two other girls who were attacking me a lot. He agreed except he didn’t keep up to his word, he started canceling plans with me and my fiancé to hangout with them so we decided to cut Drake off too. Except now my fiancé doesn’t have his two best friends anymore, or any friend group really, and I can’t help but feel like I ruined it for him. Maybe if I wasn’t so fucking weird, people would actually like me and want to hangout with me but now I’ve ruined that for both me and my fiancé and I feel like a disgusting weirdo that will continue to have no friends because of how weird I am.
Edit: I want to add that I’m an age regressor, therian and use xenogenders. The post they were commenting on was about xenogenders. Normally I’d just say “haters gonna hate” and move on but now I’m insecure that these things I like are actually things that I shouldn’t because it will scare people away."

"The void hears you...

Friends aren't friends if they cannot handle what you love. He loves you, and thus they failed the core part of being a friend, to support each other. We all have things, kinks of personality, that make us ""wierd"". That just means that no one is normal, but like to cut people out because they cannot get past being uncomfortable. Perhaps it's something in their own past, or how they are raised. It really doesn't matter. 

Finding new friends can be hard and also simple for adults. Sometimes it's a matter of looking for similar activities like gaming, coloring, or knitting. Other times it's more complex. But that is part of the adventure.

"  
Considering how long you've been smoking, I'd say that you're doing great. People often complain of being terribly depressed when they stop smoking weed.  
  
My guess is that all you need is knowing how to calm down when you're agitated.   
  
For what's it's worth, I'll mention SMARTRecovery.org - like a brainy version of NA, ex-users who believe in psychology.  
  
Also, advice from experts about depression in my comments, including the self-help things, which as mostly very easy.  
  
DBT, the best treatment for borderline personality disorder has very good methods for calming down called distress tolerance.  
  
Good habit - responding to moments of stress by breathing slowly.  
  
If you're tempted to get mad at somebody, stop, calm down, and think about the best way to respond.  
  
Marsha Linehan, who created DBT, was talking about the methods and two she emphasized were DBT paced breathing and distractions - things that change your mood, like a funny movie or video and beautiful music.  
  
Paced breathing - put a hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, then breathe gently while counting seconds - inhale to a count of 5, exhale to a count of 7. Breathe gently through your nose.

"I (16F) think I’ve had some mental health troubles in the past and currently but the two times that I’ve brought it up with my parents they’ve said that it’s normal for for a teeenage girl to be emotional and moody, and sometimes I’m dramatic and overreact. 

When I was 14-15 I had quite a low point in my life where I had zero motivation for anything which turned into me missing assignments or doing the bare minimum. Whenever the result inevitably didn’t turn out well I not only got disappointed in myself but my parent would scold me and yell at me for not putting in enough effort and being lazy etc. during this time i had suicidal thoughts and rarely did self harm. I ended up planning exactly how i would commit and bought the supplies i needed. Before I actually attempted, i was having what i assume might’ve been a panic attack and decided to message one of my friends (now boyfriend). I never mentioned my feelings or intentions at the time and just asked if he wanted to talk for a while. We talked for about 2 hours about random things, before i decided that committing would hurt him and my other friends and i wouldn’t want to be the cause of that. 
These days I’m doing better but still occasionally have episodes of panic? Or just sadness? Which are often caused by a disappointing grade or a chore or homework being incomplete resulting in my parents (usually mother) yelling at me. I’ve noticed that i now avoid talking to anyone I’m not already close with as much as possible, and i start crying a lot when someone raises their voice at me. Recently my mother and i got into an argument to which after a bit i raised my voice back because she wouldn’t stop to let me speak. I feel awful whenever i have to get louder, but i couldn’t stand her being loud with me. 
Often my parents will both say that I’m being rude but i really don’t think what i say is particularly rude, just bluntly saying what happened. I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong. 
This has led to what may be poor mental health, however google hasn’t given me answers i can work with, some of my friends say it’s normal and some don’t, and at this stage i can’t really bring myself to talk to a doctor or anything. Am i just being sensitive?

"So sorry about what you’re going through.  Being a teenager is tough at the best of times without your mind being in the wrong place.  

I’d guess that if your parents are like this now they may have always been like this and if they were tough with you when you were younger this could have affected your developing mind.

So, for starters, look into attachment theory for the different types of emotional attachment… basically, secure and non-secure.  

Secure is as the name says.. you’re happy, confident with those around you to talk about stuff because of the caring or sympathetic environment you were brought up in.

Non-secure is the opposite (and there are 3 sub-types) where you can have social and emotional difficulties in relating to others, how you see yourself, etc, and this can make you withdrawn, attention seeking and various other behaviours.

Many websites list the various behaviours.  

Brains are complicated and who “you” are is the result of how your mind, your subconscious, processes what you see, what you hear, your experiences and feelings into your “reality”.  But also, early experiences can make you more anxious, maybe, and that feeds into how you behave… not talking about stuff, not wanting to raise issues, not wanting confrontation."

"It's true that people your age are more likely to be moody than adults, and that is one reason why parents are often reluctant to help their children with getting professional care.  
  
There are simple things that help us with motivation for getting things done, even if we are depressed. I'll say more about this.  
  
I'm sure they would have no objections if you said you've been reading about ways to improve your grades (details below).   


   It has become difficult for people to get therapy because of the demand, but you have options. A very good site called Healthline rates online services.  
  
  
If you can't see a therapist, self-help is better than nothing. A lot of people benefit from it. Self-help is a way to show you're serious that doesn't create friction in the family. In fact, it wouldn't be surprising if your parents liked some healthy changes in your behavior.  
  
  
Self-help can be educational for parents as well as kids. A good self-help book explains what therapy for depression is like.  
  
  
With depression, there's what seems like a Catch 22. People say, ""I know there are things that will make me feel better - getting exercise, taking care of myself, straightening up the house and cleaning, but I'm depressed and I don't have the energy.  
  
  
Here's the thing - very important. People do have energy when they're depressed - as much energy as they always do, but for some reason, the system is reluctant to let you use your energy.  
  
  
We have to use psychology to coax energy out of our systems. Psychology has some nifty tricks.  
  
  
A famous psychiatrist, Abraham Low, said that when we can't control our feelings we can still control our muscles. If you tell your arms and legs to get you out of bed or to the bathroom for a shower, they will obey.  
  
  
Try this when it seems that you're too tired to work. Lie on the couch, close your eyes, and get ready to work by imagining yourself working for 5 minutes.  
  
  
This is a motivation trick that's been used in behavior modification programs since the 1930s. If a task seems like it's too big, think of it as a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time, and start with something really, really easy. Cleaning - start by cleaning for 3 or 4 min and take a 5 min break. Homework - start by proofreading a paper or previewing a chapter you're going to read by looking at headings, sub-headings, etc.  
  
  
You don't have to be an athlete to benefit from exercise. As little as 20 min brisk walking a day can help, and you can add to that gradually so long as you don't make yourself sick of exercise with too much and quit. Steve Ilardi, the therapist/researcher who headed the lifestyle-depression project at the Univ of Kansas, talks about enjoyable ways to get exercise.  
  
  
If you go to Metapsychology, you can read a psychologist's review of Dr Ilardi's book (""splendid"").  
  
  
Of all the traditional mind-body practices (meditation, etc.), the one with the best evidence for affecting mood disorders is yoga breathing. Slow breathing is used for treating anxiety, depression, panic disorder, and PTSD. It's safe and it doesn't take any training.  
  
  
Video, below - details about self-help based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and lifestyle choices that help with depression - nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise, and social support, also traditional Asian methods.  
  
  
It has advice specifically for depressed students, such as StudentsAgainstDepression.org.

"This question has recently perplexed me but I was hoping that someone here would have the answer.
Whenever we get an injury on our physical body, we understand wether if we need to go to a hospital or not. For example:
1. A broken arm = Hospital
2. A small paper cut = plaster 
3. Can't hear out of one of your ears = Hospital 
4. Tripped and grazed a lil bit of skin = probably not serious enough to go to a hospital

My question is: When is it a good time to go and seek a mental health professional? Becuase unlike a physical visualisation of a broken bone, to me the severity of your mental health doesn't seem as obvious as a chopped off arm bleeding. 
My worry is that if I feel depressed and I go to a psychologist or psychiatrist and say that ""I'm suffering a mental pain that's equivalent of a broken arm"" but in realty it's nothing more than a ""mental paper cut"", I would feel like I'm wasting the professionals time.

"As of current, I've run out of ideas on how to help my mom. 

She (since me or my brother was born) has always been very volatile and emotional. She was years ago diagnosed with ""some"" personality disorder, but that's it. Mainly because she's adamant on lying/manipulating, which she has bragged to me.

But it has gotten so bad, that she barely cares for her or the house she lives in anymore. There's rotting food everywhere, and her electricity has been off in the heat... I just want her to get help. But I'm unsure how.

"I broke up with my boyfriend of five years about two months ago and it is really catching up to me, all I do know is work, cry and waste my time on my computer.

I hurt him really badly and couldn't be with him anymore as I felt guilty about the things I did, he didn't deserve this and I never appreciated his efforts he put into our relationship this makes me feel so terribly selfish and stupid, now I look back at the times we had together and our texts and I think: how could i've been so blind? I never really loved myself, so I could never comprehend how someone else could love me, now I lost the only person in my life I am now really confident about, who loved and cared about me, who was there for me and really understood me. He really understood me in the sense that I could say or do something and look into his eyes and know he gets me.

It feels like a loved one died. Because after all the shit I did, I feel like he could never trust me again and there is no hope left. I got told that time wil heal my wounds, but with every day going by it feels like it's only getting worse.

What comforts me is the thought that I deserve this, I truly know that these are the consequences of my own actions and the pain I feel now is a sign that I am aware of my mistakes, i genuinely hope he is happy and he has all the best in his life, because he is a wonderful person and truly deserves it.

Hello , so basically i saw a reel [ik ik absurd ] and yeah it was this reel about if you are going through deep loneliness.  amd personally peoplebwould say why would you believe in it , its fake and to some extent i would agree but all those things that were said were matching with my own self and life events

i was a bit shocked and in denial that this cant be true like duh its a reel it cant be that true . but my overthinking self made it a a big deal. i then started shaking, thinking, what about if it is true, what does that mean and overall freaking myself out.

After that i calmed myself down by distracting myself.and now in a much better state.but its still making me feel haunted that what is happening to me. i really cant actually discuss it with my family considering that these people do not actually believe so in ""mental wellbeing"" and they wouldn't care. rather they would actually make me feel bad about saying such stuff as i am the fault in it

i really don't know what to do."	SamasyaInto100	post	6.1242334312433115	male	White	0.009176379069685936	na	na	na	2	MentalHealth

What I usually tell people who have a problem with money -  
1) Your GP may be helpful, perhaps in directing your search, helping you with your priorities, or giving you a prescription. You might get help at Mark Cuban's affordable drug company online. This  company is getting a lot of attention lately. Some are saying that it can radically change the drug industry.  
2) There's a variety of things that can help - low-cost, low-risk things that are easy and can be combined with each other. I have advice from experts in my comments.

3) Do research, including study of the online therapy reviews. Healthline, a site I rely on for good information, has an article that rates online services.  
  
Do what you can to get a therapist. You may have to do a lot of research about this. Don't give up. Call your local social services (211?) and ask about Medicaid and Obamacare. Also, you can google ""affordable psychotherapy."" The cost of therapy can vary a lot.

Relatable. I wish I had good advice, but all I can do is commiserate. It’s probably mostly that people don’t know what to do, but it is my experience that when I need them the most is when the people closest to me abandon me. And when I’m the most vulnerable that they are the most insensitive. Last year I confessed to my fiancé that I was struggling with thoughts of suicide and she just said “see a therapist” (which I couldn’t really afford but eventually did anyway. It helps but isn’t a substitute for support from your loved ones) then she immediately went to a friends house, and a few pleas for her support and time later she dumped me. That is just one example. All these people who do these things are people who I love and respect and would do anything for. It is hard not to notice that I am the common denominator in these disappointing events.	strugglingbitch	reply	na	na	na	0.998129665851593	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealth

"I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ADHD, and body dysmorphia. I’m currently on 75 mg Effexor and 20 mg adderall twice a day. 

Since starting the two medications, I have noticed my depression is much better. I rarely have low days. My anxiety is still pretty bad when I’m in social settings, and I get really insecure about how other people are viewing me. My most recent concern is that I’ve started picking uncontrollably at my scalp. I used to pick at my nail beds and now it’s my scalp. I now have scabs on it and can’t seem to stop. I do it when I’m anxious or when I’m deep in though. And if there’s a scab, I literally can’t stop my body from picking it off. I could sit in one place and daydream while picking at my scalp and won’t stop until my arm hurts. 

I have gotten really insecure about my scalp and have to part my hair in ways that won’t show the redness or scabs. I am getting headaches now and people have even commented on how often I pick at my head. What is causing this?? How do I make it stop? It’s taking up so much of my time during the day.

What you are experiencing is called a Body-Focused Repetitive Behavior. I don’t think it’s uncommon for people with ADHD to do them, as it’s stimulating or soothing. It can also be made worse by anxiety. I struggle with it too, picking my cuticles, and in the past I picked the scabs on my shoulders. The best thing you can do is find something else to occupy your hands, such as a fidget. Is there something on your scalp that you feel the need to ‘fix’? You could get do a scalp treatment like hair mask to get rid of imperfections that you might be picking at.	sharpytcheddar	reply	na	na	na	0.002831813180819154	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealth

"My bf asked me to go to a large wedding with him in a few weeks and I am torn on whether or not to go with him. The majority of the attendees will be people he knows from his hometown and college. I am acquainted with one other couple that will be there. 

Pros:
-good opportunity to meet more of his friends 
-good opportunity to practice overcoming my social anxiety 
-bf knows the situation makes me uncomfortable and will try his best to help me feel as included as possible 

Cons:
-wedding is an hour away from home, can’t easily dip out if it’s too much 
-I’ll be the DD, can’t drink to ease my anxiety and loosen up 
-I’ve been through a similar situation with the same group of people on a smaller scale and felt like the odd one out the whole time. I don’t have anything in common with these people except my boyfriend. Small talk is so uncomfortable for me. 

Recently talked a lot with my therapist about how I hold myself back socially by overthinking. I need to stop overthinking and “just do it” for six months and then reassess how I feel about social situations. This is an opportunity to take that advice but my skin crawls and I want to cry just from imagining myself in a crowded room feeling awkward for hours. I also feel like I let him down when I can tell he feels bad that I’m not doing well at an event or hangout. I appreciate so much that he notices and cares, but the guilt is still there. I feel like I’m letting him down if I don’t go at all, or that his friends will feel like I’m not interested in them. 

What should I do? 

TLDR; talk me into attending an event that will definitely trigger my social anxiety, or talk me into feeling ok with avoiding the discomfort that will surely ensue."	pricklypear84	post	19.93694516537732	male	White	0.9948421120643616	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
"Between a rock and a hard place - you're not comfortable either way.  
  
If you decide to go, here's a couple of tips -  
  
Slow breathing can help with awkward social situations and phobias.   
  
The most common treatment for phobias is exposure therapy, and that can be done with clients exposing themselves to mental images of the feared situation.   
  
You can get good and relaxed, then imagine yourself in a situation that makes you nervous.  Doctors recommend a simple exercise - breathe gently through the nose, 6 sec inhale and 6 sec exhale.  
  
Also, you can also slow your breathing just before and during a conversation.  
  
One of the best pieces of advice I know of, from a book that has been a best-seller for generations -  
  
Good listeners are always welcome!  
  
You can be regarded as a good conversationalist by simply smiling and saying things like  ""Oh really!"" That's great!"" ""Wow, that's interesting.""   
  
You have the advantage of your bf with you. He can intervene if you're at a loss for words. Tell him, ""Feel free to interrupt me.""

"Sometimes, simple motivation advice will do a lot of good, but I'm not saying necessarily that these are all you need. Treating a serious case of depression with nothing but self-help is risky.  
  
Someone was here the other day and said, ""I know they say you should take things in steps, start with something really easy, but I can't even work for 5 minutes.""  
  
He was satisfied with my reply - ""If you can't start with 5, start with 3 or 2. Hell, you can start with 10 seconds.""   
  
  
It's all about confidence - a great antidepressant. >>  
  
  
A famous psychiatrist, Abraham Low, said that when we can't control our feelings we can still control our muscles. If you tell your arms and legs to get you out of bed, they will obey. Count down from 10 and at zero, move with all your might.  
  
  
Try this when it seems that you're too tired to work. Lie on the couch, close your eyes, and get ready to work by imagining yourself working for 5 minutes. Think in terms of taking it step by step and starting with something really easy.  
  
  
Taking things in baby steps - very important. This is the key to motivation and motivation is the key to recovery.  
  
  
Just 20 min of brisk walking a day can help, and you can add to that gradually so long as you don't make yourself sick of exercise with too much.  
  
  
This is a motivation trick that's been used in behavior modification programs since the 1930s. If a task seems like it's too big, think of it as a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time, and start with something really, really easy. Cleaning - start by cleaning for 3 or 4 min and take a 5 min break. Homework - start by proofreading a paper or previewing a chapter you're going to read by looking at headings, sub-headings, etc.  
  
  
You can even use the baby steps principle for having fun. If you're not getting any enjoyment out of things, here's something people here have said is helpful with that problem. Look all over and do a complete inventory. You should be able to find at least one or two things you like, such as your favorite music or movie. If there's just one movie you like, watch it once or twice. Then, find movies that are like it in some way - with similar story or the same actor. Keep adding to your entertainment supply to give it variety.  
  
  
If you're thinking about professional help, treatment usually begins by seeing the GP, who can give you a referral. I mention referral because just a bottle of pills is not a very good approach. The things you'd want to tell the doctor are how you feel at different times of day, any symptoms you might have such as change in appetite or sleep, and things in your life affecting how you feel.  
  
  
If you're depressed, I can't tell you exactly what you need. There's no one size fits all solution. I can tell you though that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits.

"Hello

Stomach Aches can happen, when we are anxious. Anxiety can cause all sort of psychosomatic symptoms, regardless of the why.

In my opinion the root of your Abandonment Issues is **Emotional Dependency / Codependency**: Basically your only source of happiness is people (boyfriend/friends) instead of from multiple sources (hobby, work,etc).

\- **Our Activities affect our self steem**: It's important to have different areas in your life that make you feel happy, not be emotionally dependant on one area (for example your boyfriend)  
  
\+ Exercise / Sports  
  
\+ Hobbies  
  
\+ Friends / Love/ Family  
  
\+ Working or Studying  
  
\+ Having long term projects in our life by yourself , etc.  
  
The key is to not obsess over one area and spend all your resources there because your SELF ESTEEM will depend on that thing only (relationship) and you will feel empty, depressed and suicidal when that doesn't work out.

You will be constantly insecure, checking his messagess, feeling sick when he isn't around: ***That's not love, it's dependency!***

This emotional dependency is the reason why people stay in abusive relationship knowing it's bad for them or why they become extremely controlling of their boyfriend and sabotage themselves: *It's all you have in your life. Literally. All your life, every hour of the day is focused on that relationship.*

Your Anxiety can be caused by negative thoughts about yourself (self doubt, blaming, feeling inferior, ""sacrificing"" yourself for others, etc)

\- **Our Thoughts affect our mood**: What we think is what we feel, if you spend all day thinking bad things about yourself then you will feel bad. Taking decisions for yourself and being CONFIDENT without needing others is also a key part here!  
  
Taking the blame for everything and thinking negatively about yourself is the equivalent of eating rotten fruit: *It doesn't matter who sold that to you in the past, the problem is that you are still eating it!*  
  
All those thoughts that you have, you gotta ask yourself:  
**Are they actually true?**  
**How useful are them?**  
  
If you assume something as true without questioning it, you will let this very toxic thoughts ruin your mood daily. This internal dialogue, even if in some situation is true, is not useful, and consuming that daily will make your mood worse.

"Hey guys, I normally didn't wanna do this but I just feel like I should say it somewhere. Not sure if this is the right place but I'm sorry if it isn't.

Recently, I've come to a different country with my parents to spend some time off after a very stressful academic year. But ever since coming here, I've just been burdened with my results, looking for accommodation for my next terms (WHICH CONSTANTLY GET REJECTED) and also the financial burden I feel like I'm putting on parents for my education. Idk if it's all of these combined or what but I've been basically overthinking about these for a month, day and night. I don't know what to do honestly. I have tried explaining to certain people (I don't open up easily) but all they say is that wait and time will come and like just hope for the best. But i feel like I'm all out of hope already.

I'm not upset, nor am I happy or stressed. Idk how to explain it but it just feels like nothing, like a strong emptiness in my heart to everything and every now and again, I break down. I can't really explain to anyone close to me either.

"Hello

It seems like you feel like a burden, that your parents are suffering because of you, that you are not good enough for what they expect and that all this pressure is building up, you doubt yourself and are trying to do your best but fear at what cost?  
  
You should talk about this with your parents and let them know what they think abou this: It could be the case that the thoughts that are causing the anxiety, maybe reality isn't like that 

*Maybe they are glad to spend money on you as long as you're studying and knowing that you will have a solid education gives them inner peace despite the economical strains. If you don't talk to them, you won't see their perspective.*   
  
\- **Our Thoughts are just that THOUGHTS**: Just because you think something it doesn't mean it's true. Our mind is like a Parrot that is constantly repeating stuff, you gotta listen to what it says and QUESTION IT.  
  
You can't just let thoughts like ""I'm a burden to my family"" or ""I shouldn't accept a gift because it's expensive"" through without analyzing them. You have to check for evidence.  


***""I'm a burden to my family""*** \> You are not responsible for their decisions, they CHOOSE to send you there because THEY wanted to. They don't need to support you financially at that age. **They do it because THEY LOVE YOU.**

***""I shouldn't accept a gift, it's too expensive""***\> Again, a gift from someone else is NOT YOUR DECISION. It's not your money, it's their money and they choose to do what they want with it. If they feel like they can spend their money, you have to trust their judgment and not feel guilty about it: You can give gifts too when you have a PhD and work!

If they couldn't handle your studies and the sacrifices were too much, they would have told you already. They have their reasons TALK TO THEM.   
^(My parents would pay my studies even if it was just to boost their egos!)

All those thoughts that you have, you gotta ask yourself:

***Are they actually true?***

***Are they useful?***  
  
If you assume something is true without asking yourself if that is true and not taking in other perspectives, **then you will never see reality**. Not only that, this internal dialogue is not useful, thinking about this daily without questioning this will only make your obsess more.  
  
\- Our **Daily Activities** affect our attention too: It's important to have different areas in your life that make you feel happy, so you don't obsess over money or your exams:  
  
\+ Exercise / Sports  
  
\+ Hobbies  
  
\+ Friends / Love/ Family  
  
\+ Working or Studying  
  
\+ Having long term projects in you life by yourself , etc.  
  
The key is to not obsess over one area and spend all your resources there because your ATTENTION will ALWAYS BE ON THAT THING. 

If you don't even leave the house to not spend money, then you stop doing stuff... and what happens? Oh yeah **you have nothing else to do in your day than to think about money**

I have extreme worries and paranoia that can come and go instantly. For example, I can worry about something on my body and obsess over it for days. All I'll do for those days is constantly check myself and Google non stop. All of a sudden I'll instantly stop worrying about that particular thing and something else will pop into my head that I'll obsess over for days / weeks, until the next worry rolls on.

When a worry is superceded by another, I no longer worry about the former topic at all and almost laugh at myself.

If the worries go on for long enough I get extremely tired and start to dissociate. It affects my day to day life hugely.

Does anyone have experience with this?"	Successful_End_3861	post	28.136822514699755	female	White	0.9810024499893188	na	na	na	3	MentalHealth

"Hello, it looks like your biggest issue are your constant thoughts about your health and you focus on one thought obsessing over it.

It seems to be a very common case of ***Obsessive Compulsive Disorder*** were you have this irrational idea in your head and this gives you a lot of anxiety, so to feel better you google about it just to ""be sure"" right?.

As you can tell, it your own thoughts that are causing the anxiety, not reality itself.

\- Our **Thoughts are just that THOUGHTS**: Just because you think something it doesn't mean it's true. It's like reading something from the internet, you can't just believe it!Our mind is like a **Parrot** that is constantly repeating nonsense, you gotta listen to what it says and ***QUESTION IT. DEEPLY.***

You can't just let thoughts like ""I have an undiagnosed terminal ilness"" or ""This person is chasing me"" through without analyzing them. 

Like you gotta form the habit of analyzing what you think and seeing the evidence.

*You checked google for 15 minutes already and it doesn't look like it? Well that's it, you don't have it, let it go. It's a dumb parrot, just stop listening to it and do something else!*

All those thoughts that you have, you gotta ask yourself:**Are they actually true?Are they useful?**

If you assume something is true without asking yourself if that is true to begin with then you will believe nonsense stuff all the time. Not only that, this internal dialogue is not useful, thinking about this daily without questioning them will only make your obsess more.

\- Our **Daily Activities** affect our attention too: It's important to have different areas in your life that make you feel happy, so you don't obsess over one thing all day.

\+ Exercise / Sports

\+ Hobbies

\+ Friends / Love/ Family

\+ Working or Studying

\+ Having long term projects in our life by yourself , etc.

The key is to not obsess over one area and spend all your resources there because your ATTENTION will ALWAYS BE ON THAT THING.

*You don't do anything else all day, of course your attention will go towards that one thing you do (worrying about illnesses and googling).*

*You literally have nothing else to think about in your life.*

***This has become your life.***"	Successful_End_3861	reply	na	na	na	0.9810024499893188	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth
That sounds like an anxiety disorder. Depending on the specifics either GAD or OCD. I had GAD and this is exactly what I was doing too. It's all coming from being too uncomfortable with uncertainty. You must avoid all reassurance and get used to uncertainty in order to get better. But you might also need medication.

"  
Last night we argued with my bf. After he was asleep i left the room for a short walk. Then something happened to him, i dont want professional help or diagnosis here. He will of course go to a psychiatrist but it will take weeks because of the  health system. İn the meanwhile i just want to have an idea about it. It doesnt fit into anything i know. Me(and my bf) want to further read about this. Did anyone experience  something similar. And can this be related to cptsd or ptsd. Maybe something triggered him and he had an episode like this... can anyone relate? What are your stories?    
(Also what other suitable subreddits can i crosspost this?)    
 When i returned from the walk i found him sitting on the floor with a thousand yard stare. I knew something was wrong and i sat with him and hugged him. As soon as i did he started to shake uncontrollably and twitch and cry. İ felt him lose control of his body. All his weight was on me, i couldn't hold him no more and we fell laying on the ground. He looked like someone who just was shot in the stomach. Clamping his muscles, twitching in pain and letting out grunts and moans that he couldnt hold back(we have housemates he was trying to be quiet) his eyes were swollen and red from conracting his body and crying but there werent much tears. I put a pillow below his head.he would keep moving his hands, first laying like starfish, then he would place his hand on his stomach and dig his nails in. He would turn around, bury his face on the ground, at one point he was about to bang his head but i stopped him and placed my hands under his forehead. He started gasping. He would cover his face in agony and subconciously scratch his face. His legs were jiggling and he couldnt talk. At onr point i told him i was calling an ambulance. He shook his head aggresively. I asked do you really think this is emotional and he nodded. It wad obvious that it was hard even for him to move his head intentionlly. When he dug his fingers in his skin or did anything that might hurt, i would stop him gently, i gave him my wrists and told him he can clench tight instead. İt went like this for... i guess half an hour but im not sure i had lost my sense of time because it was such a horrible situation. He was in terrible pain the whole time. He was holding on to the legs of the bed and unintentionally overstretching. It just looked like a transition scene out of a werewolf movie. İ felt completely helpless and didnt know what to do except for saying; im here, dont forget to breathe and kind words.while later it found a rythym of him getting a hold of his breath, for a while, being able to relax his muscles and looking calm. Laying on his back, arms open. And then all of a sudden his face would have painful expression and he would quickly roll over to his side and end up in fetus position holding his knees, bury his face in the floor or the pillow, sob, grunt, clench and tremble. He was covered in sweat. I kept reminding him to breathe. He was unable to exhale from his mouth. İ would help him open his lips. He altered between these two states for 2 or 3 times. I told him to blink once to say yes and dont blink to say no. Then in the times he looked calm i would ask him, is it okay to touch? (Yes) Do you act like this because it hurts? (Yes) can you open your mouth(no) can you control your body(no) does it feel like sleep paralysis(shook his arms as in i dont know) are you able to think (yes) is it just dark thoughts (yes) can i ask questions about what happened (he shooks his arms slightly) would it make it worse(yes) do you want me to talk about something or tell you about simple stuff and get you distracted (no) do you want music (no) can i go quickly to the bathroom (no) can you feel your body (yes)     
Then i tried to distract him asking does he feel hungry or does he remember what color our blanket was.    
 One of those painful states he kept raising his hand as if he was trying to reach at something and he would grip the empty air. He opened his and looked at the ceiling. His stomach looked like it was flexing again and again. He looked possessed. He started gasping, he was shaking completey and and he mumbled as he cried, he was trying so hard to talk and i finally realised he was repeating this,  ""help me please"" he kept moving his body from side to side. .    
Finally he calmed down he even got up with my help and got on the bed. But he didnt seem much concious still, even then. İn the morning he was awake but couldnt open his eyes. He moved but barely. because it was too tiring for him. İ helpled him, made him clench and relax some of his muscled for him to gain control, eventually after a lot of love and hugs, helping him through he was able to get up even come out with me, i needed to go to work. We work at the same place but differrnt shifts. Hr came with me talked with people even laughed but he was a little off. His movements were too slow. He told me he still felt the pain. He didn specify where exactly. He asked me did he get up on the bed himself or did i carry him, he told me he barely remembers what happened that night."	skysalight	post	23.680929084015506	male	White	0.996756374835968	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
"That sounds like a panic attack, yeah. That’s what I get from time to time. It might be more than that, too, but that’s for a professional to say. 

The only thing I’d recommend for you as a partner is to ask if he wants touched when he is like this. Sometimes I don’t want to be touched and it sets me off more. Beyond that, you’re a lovely person and it was good for you to be there for him. It’s incredibly kind what you did, and I hope you know that. ❤️"	skysalight	reply	na	na	na	0.996756374835968	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealth
"I am 16 years old and throughout this entire school year and summer vacation I have had this guilt in everything I do. I can't describe it with any other emotion. I do anything, really, and I feel like I'm wasting my time. Doing homework? Guilty. Watching YouTube? Guilty?  Doing artwork? Guilty. Even making videos and skits, something that no matter what always boosted my mood, makes me feel incredibly guilty. And it's not just this overarching feeling of guilt, everything I do feels like it is bringing its own unique guilt to the table. During the school year I ignored the feeling, but now that its summer I can't ignore it and it's so confusing and stops me from doing anything. I just sit and stare at nothing trying to figure out why I feel so bad. It feels like I'm desperately trying to avoid making my parents mad at anything I do. Like I'm always about to be yelled at for doing something wrong or doing something too much.

On top of that, random things have been giving me this dreadful feeling of sadness. Like I'll look at someone eating something unhealthy and for some reason I feel just sad. Or I'll hear someone say they played video games all day and it makes me feel horrible? I don't usually judge people for these things and I think that it's ok and functional to do those things yet I feel awful still.

And it's not helpful that I'm incredibly lonely at the moment. None of my friends want to hangout. It's strange how kind they seem at school and the genuine friendship they offer me yet when I attempt to set up something over the summer they suddenly stop responding to what I send them. Most of my friends are in relationships, and I am too, but they only seem to want to hangout with their significant others. Also most of my friends seem to have their own friends away from me and they seem to just be hanging out with them rather than hanging out with the friend group I've developed at school. My best friend doesn't want to hangout anymore because his gf is upset at him. And my other best friend just ghosted our entire friend group. I miss playing video games with my friends who now play without me. I miss hanging out during the summer without feeling like people don't want me around.

I do ""the right things"" I journal, work out,  socialize (I have a kickboxing class 3x a week), take care of myself, engage in hobbies, talk with my girlfriend, I'm present with my family and yet I just feel absolutely awful and it's messing with me so much. I feel like I'm wasting my summer. I need some sort advice please."	wowtatprerrtylit	post	19.087474893500552	female	White	0.9992510676383972	na	na	na	3	MentalHealth

"This is literally just hormonal puberty and the fact that school leads to certain social dynamics because of the forced socialization it provides. Outside of that dynamic people change. What other interests do you have? Engage in those. Try a summer camp with more opportunities for socialization. Try gaming shops if you game. Ty volunteering at places (i had a lot of fun and experience volunteering in my teenage years at a horse rescue, working with cats and horses and dogs) and i got a lot of shrooms from the fields too! 

You may also just wanna hunker down in your bed and eat junk food and binge watch tv. I still do this with x-files, buffy/angel, firefly, and star gate sg1 to this day when im depressed. 

Its normal to be judgemental and hormonal at your time in life. It can be normal to retreat. If it feels too much to you then consult with your doctor and ask them for resources. You likely dont even need an appointment. Just ask. 

As a minor if your parents have health insurance your covered to 26. If they dont, depending on your state you can get free coverage. Betterhelp.com offers text, voice, and video coverage for differing rates (22-60 dollars a month) if you wanna talk to somebody. Seraph.com can issue you prescriptions and allow mental health screenings for as low as 9.99 a month. There are also many support groups available at community centers and churches if you research them. 

Just dont take anything too seriously right now. Your whole world will change if you go to college or a trade school and both lead to new opportunities and experiences with new vastly  broad social networks.

"so about a month ago, on May 15th, i moved south with my partner — from michigan to north carolina.  we both thought it would be a fairly easy process, because the apartments down here are fairly cheap, and i was enroute to receiving my liscense soon.

it’s now june 23rd — we’re on the waitlist for two apartments, with no word back.   we’re still calling apartments, but they either won’t pick up the phone, or their waitlists are months long.   we’re currently staying with my partner’s grandmother, but she has to be out of her current place by the 30th of this month.

i’m planning on getting my driver’s license next week, and i just started work again.  thankfully the family is letting me borrow a car for the time, but they’re advising that i wait until we have a place to actually buy one for myself.

our living situation is getting unbearable and i don’t know what to do.  in a week, our state of homelessness is up in the air.

at this point, rent and other expenses are the least of my worries.  but i can’t focus on those until we have a place, and i don’t know when that’s going to be.

"Over the last week or so, I’ve been working with myself to become more assertive and stop letting people walk all over me. I’m already really proud of my progress. But it feels like there’s been a shift in my emotions that go beyond nerves about leaving my comfort zone.

Things that didn’t make me upset before now causes me to tear up and want to cry. Same with frustration, stress and I’m assuming anger (though I rarely get angry so it’s hard to tell). The same applies to positive emotions too. When I’m happy, I’m more visibly cheerful.

When you avoid problems and let people walk over you, what happens is that this *external problem* we avoided (discussion, conflict,etc) turns into an *internal problem* (self esteem). This really makes us depressive or aphatic, makes us feel inferior and that we don't deserve anything, that expressing our needs is a bother to the other person...

i think the most common form of derealization is that your vision gets a bit blurry and nothing seems real. The main reason why I think you've got it is because you mentioned how this often happens when you're in a fight with your mom. I think your body gets triggered into protection mode and starts disassociating as a way of coping with her abuse

I feel so alone and that no one is taking me seriously. Sometimes I wish I never got off of the antidepressants because I wouldn’t have been in this predicament. I don’t think I’ve ever witnessed bedtime anxiety this badly before and I feel like that’s the issue because I am off of the antidepressants.

The key is to not obsess over one area and spend all your resources there because your SELF ESTEEM will depend on that thing only (relationship) and you will feel empty, depressed and suicidal when that doesn't work out.  
  
You will be constantly insecure, checking his messagess, feeling bad when he isn't around: *That's not love, it's dependency!*  
  
This emotional dependency is the reason why people stay in abusive relationship knowing it's bad for them or why they become extremely controlling of their boyfriend and sabotage themselves: It's all you have in your life. Literally. All your life, every hour of the day is focused on that relationship.  
  
Your Anxiety can be caused by negative thoughts about yourself (self doubt, blaming, feeling inferior, ""sacrificing"" yourself for others, etc)  
  
\- **Our Thoughts affect our mood**: What we think is what we feel, if you spend all day thinking bad things about yourself then you will feel bad. Thinking that he doesn't like you because you are flawed and that if you leave him then nobody will love you, all this things affect your mood daily.  
  
Taking the blame for everything and thinking negatively about yourself is the equivalent of eating rotten fruit: *It doesn't matter who sold that to you in the past, the problem is that you are still eating it!*  
  
All those thoughts that you have, you gotta ask yourself:  
Are they actually true?  
How useful are them?  
  
If you assume something as true without questioning it, you will let this very toxic thoughts ruin your mood daily. This internal dialogue, even if in some situation is true, is not useful, and consuming that daily will make your mood worse.  
  
You gotta question your thoughts, spread out your activities and work on yourself first!"	Capable-Farmer8963	reply	na	na	na	0.9988240599632263	no	no	no	na	MentalHealth
It realy hurts. It feels like they are leaving me, even if they obviously arent. I dont feel included in anything anymore, even if i make an effort to talk in groups, i still feel like an intruder invading their privacy. I feel so selfish, i feel like i only care about myself deep inside, but everyone else says i dont. I dont know why. I dont know why they put up with me at all, i truly believe the people i love so much dont deserve to put up with how annoying and selfish i am.  Why? Why does the person i love so much even give me an ounce of attention? Ive been the worst to them, i know it. Because all i ever do is ask them how they feel about me, and i feel like ive absolutely exhausted them. I feel so guilty for even being in their life. So guilty for doing anything at all. My poor mother has to get surgery and all i care about is when i can see them. I think that really shows how terrible i am. Im so selfish and egotistical. I hate myself. I regret everything ive ever done, and none of my poor friends or family deserve to have to put up with my selfishness. I hate myself. 	strawberrycake819	post	16.620659271302763	female	White	0.9994189739227295	na	na	na	1	MentalHealth
"If your where the selfish type, it wouldn't even cross your mind. The fact you're worrying about the effect your having to those around you means you care about them. You care because you have morals. Even though you feel like your undeserving of their love and attention.

We're our own worst critic. We're quick to blame ourselves when things don't go to plan. We're quick to over analyse all our faults and short comings. It sounds like your struggling with your self worth. I also have this problem. There's nothing worse then feeling like a burden in those around you. I wish I had the answer, but there isn't a quick solution. I would say you need to speak with a therapist. 

I've had therapy in the past before. CBT therapy focuses on your triggers, and what happens when you hit that bottom line. It's the loop back from hell. The thing that makes your life miserable. The bottom line is that your mind has fallen into a bad habit. And habits are difficult to break, but not impossible. You have to fight this. Don't be afraid of having some me time. I know it's a lonely and terrifying place. So I'll make you a deal. You tell me that you'll try to get the help you need, and I'll promise to do the same.

"I was recently diagnosed with BPD (Borderline) and I've had mixed anxiety and depression for a couple years now. I shared the diagnosis with a friend of mine. He responded with 
""I think if you want to diagnose everyone and everything, everybody's bound to have a disorder. I was once diagnosed with Bipolar, took medication for about a week and gave up once I realised pot heals me better. I've just replaced medication with pot now.""

This felt incredibly invalidating to me. Almost makes me feel like my disorder is just a commonality and my medications aren't to keep my hormones at check but a cover under which I've been hiding my true self.

"I honestly think BPD is one of the most misunderstood disorders. Emotional Regulation Disorder would be a far better description. I don’t know if you have looked at Dialectic Behaviour Therapy (DBT) but it’s author, Marsha Linehan, had BPD and designed it as a modality of treatment for BPD. So, if you haven’t done it, I would highly recommend it.

I would very strongly disagree with your friend. What he demonstrates is a very superficial understanding of Mental Illness. If he sat down with the DSM-5-TR or Chapter 5 of the ICD 11 and hypothetically try and diagnose people he knows, if he is honest, he won’t be successful. Theodore Roosevelt once said, “Comparison is the thief of joy.” Comparing yourself with your friend is not actually a valid comparison, you have been diagnosed with BPD which must be one of the hardest conditions to manage and his sum total understanding is one week which is not enough time for any Bipolar medication to be effective or even get to therapeutic dose. 

I think some of the language you use in your second paragraph well and truely validate your diagnosis. I would challenge you to take all those thoughts and name the feelings (in your own journal) and address the feelings. I know you feel invalidated but hopefully you feel more validated now. You feel like a fraud because you have been invalidated. You are not a fraud because BPD symptoms are not what everyone goes through at some stage. Think Emotional Regulation and your difficulty controlling that and any maladaptive behaviours you may adapt, that is not an everyone behaviours. In terms of modalities of treatment, I am not sure how you can actually manage BPD without some form of medication. My approach to medication is that it actually levels the playing field with others. So,rather than looking at medication as a cover of your normal self, think of it as allowing you to be normal self. Most mental illness is stigmatised but BPD is probably more so than most, but I think it is ignorance and the name doesn’t help.

Wouldn’t recommend ssri’s unless you really believe you need them. Nicotine and caffeine are literally drugs in the sense that they release dopamine, so they definitely give a sense of joy.

"You need dopamine. The ""satisfaction, pleasure, reward"" one. You could try NDRI's. Of course I have no clue if you would benefit from serotonin boost as well but if it comes down to ""reward"" it's better. If you need both the dopamine and serotonin (happiness, well-being) you can also do a combo.

There is a lot to say about the subject and people only focus on SSRI's.
There are 3 main ""molecules"" - serotonin (well being), dopamine (doing things and feeling good for accomplishing) and norepinephrine (dealing with stress, bodies natural element to adapt to situations).

It should always go well beyond a conversation of ""anti depressants"" - these 3 are all extremely important. Ask your doctor about it directly don't feel ashamed. Unfortunately many doctors take advantage of the info most public has and prescribe SSRI's left and right when the issue might not have anything to do with serotonin. 

It doesn't hurt to ask and say you are aware of more options - and if they take it the wrong way, they're not good professionals, it's a fast track for finding the right help for each person. 

I would dare say the majority are not the ones who will try to find the exact cause/neurotransmitter. And people should voice their knowledge and create a dialogue. The patients know best after all - they are the ones feeling what's wrong.

"I would advise you to speak with your health professional. Only you can make the decision how to treat your own health and wellbeing, and a health professional can provide you with advice. You can also do research on different types of SSRIs, each work differently at different doses on different people. 

I would ask people who take SSRIs what their experiences of them are, rather than asking a blanket question like ""should I be thinking about SSRIs"", because you're going to get the usual pillshaming garbage from people who don't know shit, rather than people telling you about their experiences of taking meds, which could help you to make a more informed decision about your own health needs.

Personally, I've had good, bad and horrific experiences with meds, because there's no one-size-fits-all medication and no objective experience. The meds and dosage I'm on now work extremely well for me and have done for years. I experience far less anxiety and after decades of being numb, the meds have enabled my emotions to resurface. 

But that was after literal decades of trying numerous different meds, both MAOIs and SSRIs. Some were bloody awful, some were so-so, some did nothing, some were bloody amazing. But due to my body chemistry all of them stopped working. The ones I'm on now are the only ones that haven't. 

If you decide you want to give meds a chance, do so. If you decide you can do without them for the moment, do without them. That's about it, basically. You don't have to get into moral or lifestyle arguments with pillshamers or pillpushers. If you think they might help, try them for about 3-6 months, and if you don't feel a difference (whatever that looks like for you), you can switch to a different SSRI or stop taking them altogether. 

Diet and exercise are helpful tools, but they're not a panacea. SSRIs are useful tools, but they're not magic. A combination of a low dose of meds, diet and exercise might end up being a happy medium for you in the short term, or in the long term if you decide to take meds and stay on them for longer. 

Whatever you decide to do to improve your health is a valid decision. Anyone trying to persuade or dissuade you can jog on-- they aren't you, and they bring their own biases into what is ultimately your personal decision. So take meds if you want to, don't take meds if you don't want to. 

Do do your own research, talk to people with lived experience of being on medications, and talk to your own health professionals, that way you'll be better informed when it comes to making a decision either way."	PsychologicalGold611	reply	na	na	na	0.0034701693803071976	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealth

"Depends. On you and your therapist. My first therapist was okay but I wasn’t very much satisfied with how it was going. For instance, I am a person with generational family trauma (and it’s intense) on top of that I’m queer. So initially it was good but by the time I was in third session I noticed that the therapist kept me from talking about my problems and she would divert it to minor issues that really didn’t bother me at all. Like I get it that they’re trying to “trace” why I think or feel so but I really didn’t see how that was necessary when I had already narrated everything. I eventually stopped going to them because I saw no improvement and my condition was only getting worst with her forcing me to write down things or think when I’m not ready to. She even recommended meds after the third sess. 
My second therapist was a blessing to me. Super patient and understanding. I gradually sensed improvement in my behaviour and perspectives. I had always struggled with stress, studying, reading, anxiety etc my whole life. Though these aren’t curable I was able to manage and ground myself after therapy started. It’s also the factor that someone out their understands my situation and struggles that helped me improve somewhat. I was able to talk freely without shame or any guilt and become more aware about myself. For example, when my thoughts consume me I am able to neutralise them when I realised they are my thoughts and not the reality. 
Therapy can be long term or short term depending on you and how honest you can be with your therapist. Mine is longterm and I still have a long way to go to overcome my thoughts, fears and insecurities. It’s scary at times when you’re putting all cards on the table. 
The downside would be 1. The expenses; especially if you’re a student and unemployed. 2. It may take some time to find yourself the right therapist. Some times though some therapists work out fine for your friend it might not for you. Some might even get extra personal and try to enforce their personal opinions regarding your situation (which was what happened with me at first) and blame you for the entire thing.

Walk into the hospital and just tell the nurse exactly what you want. Ask a friends parent or somebody you know who can drive to drop you off a few blocks away from the hospital. I know you are 15 years old but normally they don’t turn people away, who ask for help directly in the hospital unless they are drug seeking. I don’t think you are drug seeking, or anything of that sort. So I think you could probably do that to be able to find out about resources in your area from a reliable source.

Different for everyone. I personally have had great luck with it but I had to find a match for me. The first few sessions are basically interviews for both of you. They gotta feel you are in their scope and you gotta feel good with them. It can take a while to open up. My first sessions were me giving 1 word answers. Opening up was never good for me before.

"My theory is that it rarely hurts in the long run.

If you know going into it that it may take a few tries to find the right therapist (different therapists offer different niches, some like ""traditional"" talk therapy and others like CBT, somatic therapy, EMDR, and endless others) and that relief likely won't come instantly (personally, it took me two very painful years of weekly therapy to start recognizing and sorting through my deeper issues), having a realistic mindset will be helpful in setting expectations. It can be a quick commitment, but for some, therapy is a lifelong practice. 

You've only got one ""you,"" and strong emotions rarely just fade away, instead searing themselves into *your* self – so why not take care of it, and you, now? Therapy can help you unravel this idea of your ""you"" and see and understand the incredible, endless, awesome beauty and sublimity of existence. It's easy to forget that we're not just born into the world, but are made out of it – there are reasons why you feel the way you feel, like what you like, hate what you hate, crave what you crave. 

There are reasons, but there doesn't need to be any blame. We're just animals on a big old rock floating in, so why not? Shame is taught to us, usually not out of malice but out of pure *habit*. 

After growing up in an abusive household, losing a sibling to suicide, being in abusive relationships, etc. etc. etc., I didn't even realize that life didn't have to be something that just *happened to me*. I never planned to have a life past \~18 years old; I'm not sure if I would be alive without the help of therapists and psychiatrists, among other support systems I'm grateful to have. 

Best of luck!

Unfortunately we didn’t work well and the way she questioned me and just the general flow of the sessions left me feeling so much worse for at least the rest of the day after. I only went 3 times though, and some people have said to me before that it’s supposed to get worse before it gets better and it’s normal to be in a much worse mental state after like at least the first 10 sessions?

I think it is. It's like a good, outside, detached, perspective on your issues. Helps with reframing and keeping situations in context. I feel like not every session I have is a breakthrough but, every now and then, my therapist will just drop a little nugget of insight and it sticks with me.

"If you open yourself to it, its absolutely amazing. But it takes a lot of vulnerability and ownership of some not-so-pretty things about yourself sometimes. I always say that the people who therapy truly helps are the bravest people out there. Cuz NOTHING is scarier than putting it all out there to be examined by someone else. But the bright side is that the more people are open to it, the more people can heal. And the world needs that.

Therapy can be incredibly beneficial for many people. It provides a safe and supportive space to explore your thoughts, emotions, and challenges. A skilled therapist can offer guidance, perspective, and tools to help you navigate through difficult times and improve your mental well-being.

my mom has ptsd, depression, and anxiety. she also has chronic pain from severe scoliosis and a bulging disk. she rarely had any episodes anymore until her husband and i got into a pretty nasty fight right before she got into a car accident. now it's like she's having a constant episode. it's been like this since the end of march. anything i say can throw her over the edge. it's always like walking on eggshells around her. it's gotten to the point where i can't even ask what she wants for lunch. normally when she has an episode i get the children to go to there rooms and play on there phones. i leave for a few minutes and come back when i feel like she's ready to talk. then i just sit and listen and when she's calm enough i silently offer her medicine and tea. now she's not talking to me, i'm not allowed near the children because i act too much like their parents and there is no one else there to help deescalate the situation. i don't know what to do i'm just so burnt out and completely powerless.

The next day, I took a short walk around my neighborhood. I listened to the birds, smirked at a squirrel being cute, and decided to walk the next day, too.

"I'd say the ""best way"" isn't the easiest answer. Like said, I feel like different things will work differently for everyone.

Like I'm on antidepressants. Those definitely help me. 

One thing I do from time to time, especially when the times come I start feeling worse, is setting up a to-do list with little goals to accomplish throughout the day. These can be whatever, but I typically put small easy to accomplish things and  can keep building upon things if I want. I like to try walking at least .25 miles with the Charity Miles app running on my phone (fortunately, the app has an indoor walk or run to select if you don't feel like leaving home or something). No reason I can't do more once I cross that off the list.

"Generally speaking, it's treated like this -  
  
Moderate depression: therapy (usually CBT) and healthy lifestyle  
  
Severe depression: same as above, often with medication.  
  
The lockdown has changed the therapy situation. You may want to look at online therapy and self-help. Healthline, a site I rely on for good information, has an article that rates online services.  
  
  
  
  
What I usually tell people -   
  
  
Treatment often begins by seeing the GP, who can give you a referral. I mention referral because just a bottle of pills is not a very good approach. The things you'd want to tell the doctor are how you feel at different times of day, any symptoms you might have such as change in appetite or sleep, and things in your life affecting how you feel.  
  
  
If you're depressed, I can't tell you exactly what you need. There's no one size fits all solution. I can tell you though that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits.

"It's a daily battle for many. 
A lot of it is dependent on lifestyle choices though.
Try to avoid sitting in silence. Be proactive in your health and hobbies and being in contact with people you care about.
Avoid being in the dark when you dont have to. Sunlight and exercise are great benefactors to happiness.

Most importantly - talk about it. A lot of people wont understand but be open to communicating your moods and needs. It'll help combat the loneliness and hopefully open people up to helping out when they can.

diet, exercise, fresh air, etc are all great advice but on my bad days i feel paralyzed. not only do i not have any interest in the things i like, but even if i did i physically can’t bring myself to do them. i almost think it’s more important to give yourself permission to have those days and be ok not leaving the bed, but also fight to convince yourself it’s not permanent.
