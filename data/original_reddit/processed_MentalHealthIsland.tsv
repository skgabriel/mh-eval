"Hello folks.

The MHI discord is pretty bare. We still need to work things out like channels, or text channels.

When you join, you should only see a rules channel. Once you click the I agree button for the rules, the  talk channel will be available for you.

There is an inaugural talk for 11AM CST on 4/9. This is listed as a server event, so I hope it adjusts for your local time.

Note: If you join but don't click the I agree button, and go offline, you will be auto kicked. Please click on the invite link again.

I have a dislocated right arm since I was a baby. It happened when my mom tried to prevent me from jumping into the pool and accidentally twisted my elbow. I went to several doctors and they gave different opinions on when to have the operation. Some said it was better to wait until I was 13, when my bones would be fully developed. Others said it was better to do it immediately. However, my parents could not afford the surgery, so they decided to postpone it until I was older. Growing up, I did not let my dislocation bother me. I hardly noticed it and I ignored any negative comments from others. I was confident and happy with myself. But now that I am 22, I have become more insecure and troubled by my appearance. Every time I look in the mirror, I feel irritated by how my arm looks. Some people have noticed it and made me feel embarrassed. Some have even said that I am a pretty girl but too bad I have a dislocated arm. This has made me feel very insecure about my body and myself. I am afraid of what others think of me. Now that I am in medical school, I try to hide my arm by wearing a jacket, but I know that is not a permanent solution. I live in a tropical country and it is too hot to wear a jacket all the time. I have consulted some doctors and asked if there is a chance to fix my arm, but they said it is too late. They said that my bones have deformed and that surgery might damage the nerve. They also said that it is unnecessary to fix it since my arm is functional. But of course, I want to fix it for aesthetic reasons. Now every day I feel insecure and have anxiety attacks. I feel like no man will ever accept me for who I am. I feel like my arm will be a hindrance to my career. I am scared that someone will belittle me or discourage me from pursuing my dream of becoming a doctor because of my arm. I feel hopeless.

what do you guys think I should do? i feel so bothered and I just want to have a peace of mind. üòî"	Ok-Curve-130	post	27.848262153601357	female	White	0.9921693205833435	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

"What exactly would you call it? Radial head dislocation? What is the deformity? Does the elbow area look larger? Sometimes when you hyper focus on something, it becomes everything to you. Everything you are. Everything you see about yourself. You forget your eyes, your smile, your intelligence, your personality! How does a jacket hide it better than a long sleeve, tropical weather friendly shirt? A flowy shirt? Or forget about hiding it and own it! If someone ever said something negative, they‚Äôre literally miserable inside.

But own the story. Say yeah it happened when my mom saved my life. Who would have something to say after that. I know you said tropical area so I‚Äôll assume not the U S A or EU. Have you ever emailed orthopedic surgeons in the U S A or EU to ask their opinion? I also want to ask what is your goal in med school? I know someone with a major facial deformity who went to med school and is now a pediatric facial reconstruction doctor. They wanted to help others.

I think taking ownership of your body and your story can help. You‚Äôre not your arm. Your arm is fully functional. You can teach people that they‚Äôre not to speak negatively to you. You can say do not comment on me physically. It is your body! You stated a man may not want you. If you find a man that no longer likes you or isn‚Äôt interested because there is a difference in your arm then he is not the one. He is not caring, compassionate, or mature enough for you. If you hide your arm and appear sad or embarrassed of it then people recognize this. Own it. You can definitely build yourself up and maybe even use it to change other kids lives in your medical career.

You‚Äôre going to be a doctor so you‚Äôre hardworking, compassionate, and one part of your body is different because your mom saved your life and they didn‚Äôt have the means to fix it. There are so many with stories in life, own it.

Also, google/search about owning who you are, self/confidence, improving insecurity. There are some TED talks about disfigurement or deformity (more facial) but just accepting you and just being you. Google ‚ÄúTED talk owning your skin‚Äù ‚ÄúTED talk owning your self‚Äù ‚ÄúTED talk owning your deformity‚Äù‚Äî this brings up people who may look different and they own it and have made it their lives work. They will not be exactly your case BUT trust me so many of us feel the same way and insecurities. Hype yourself up!"	Ok-Curve-130	reply	na	na	na	0.9921693205833435	no	no	strong	na	MentalHealthIsland

"I break into these fits of rage over the smallest unimportant inconveniences (dropping something, misplacing something, tripping over something etc) where I curse and say or scream the most vile disgusting things I can‚Äôt even believe my mind could conjure up (and even worse it‚Äôs all mainly directed at God). I slam my hands or fists on any hard surface that will cause me pain. My hands are always bruised and/or cut and trying to heal. From this I have nerve damage and scarring. I tried punching a pillow or the couch instead, but it doesn‚Äôt relieve any of my rage. Only when I‚Äôm hurting myself do I feel relief. When it‚Äôs really bad I‚Äôm thrashing around on my bed or throwing myself to the ground, screaming. I end up with bruises on my legs and head sometimes. The screaming sometimes leaves my throat sore and scratchy. 

I only freak out in private bc I‚Äôd be mortified to act like this in public and no one deserves to see or hear this. So I suppress everything when I‚Äôm out. (Also I live alone.) The impulses are getting harder to control and it scares me so I try to leave my house everyday to escape. (I usually end up freaking out in my car too) but then I can have peace in a public place where I won‚Äôt lose it. I get sad when I have to come home.

What the heck is happening with me?! 
I want this to stop it happens daily, at any hour of the day or night. I have caused physical damage to my home (walls, floor, door, cabinet) and other belongings.

"Hello everyone. I know I haven't been active much lately. 

I'm struggling just getting ready for the day lately, much less going to work regularly. When I left my job of six years scheduling healthcare appointments back in March, I thought I could prove myself in a retail setting.

My plan was to go back to cashiering at Target, which I did previously for about a year. I wasn't able to get the same position and have struggled to meet the speed expectations of my current job there. 

Applying for disability is a job of its own that I didn't feel up to, even though I've gotten it in the past. I'd hoped to move back into healthcare at a front desk position after providing I could work a consistent schedule full time. Instead, I'm finding myself unable to do that either.

SI tends to become more active when my depression worsens. It's been hard to manage lately. It's been almost a year since my ex of 13 years told me he wanted a divorce. It still hurts every day.

If I can't work or get in disability, I don't have health insurance. I'm signed up for health coverage at Target which will start next month if I can keep my job.

I don't know what to do with myself anymore."	roanwolf75	post	36.76794367759092	male	White	0.9988372921943665	na	na	na	6	MentalHealthIsland

"Hello all, 

&#x200B;

I am very new to reddit, just joined today. Thank you for your time if you are reading this. 

Today was a rough day. I lost something of great value to me (financial and emotional) in the Swedish forests and will not be able to find it again, I was hiking off-trail. I cried a little, drove 4 hours back home from the hiking area, and thought, well if I am sad, then at least I want my puppy to be happy, and I bought a big bone for her. 

I decided to give it to her in her crate so I could vacuum the apartment ""in peace"", and when I wanted to let her out of the crate again, she growled at me over the bone. This behaviour is called ""resource guarding"" and rather common in dogs, but I had thought that through training and showing her that she can trust me I had gotten rid of it ( I have also posted about it in the Dogtraining subreddit, but no answers yet). 

&#x200B;

Now I was already really down and crying because of the lost thing, and now I am just really feeling hopeless, alone and empty. I am alone here in Sweden, without any family, and have not managed to make any friends. The dog is the only one, and now I feel like she doesn't love me either, 

&#x200B;

In the past weeks, I have repeatedly thought about what is mentally wrong with me. Here's my problem though: I have applied for an outdoor job, which is my dream job and would allow me to be outside all day with my dog. There's no other comparable job with my field of education. But since it is a state job (I'm just gonna tell it here, it's state forestry) I cannot have any mental health record. So I cannot get officially diagnosed or treated. I start to feel really alone, exhausted and hopeless. Does anyone of you know of any kind of anonymous, affordable online support? I think about bridging the time until I have the job I want - I am still a university student - and then get proper diagnosis and treatment once I have my dream job and a secure income. 

&#x200B;

I just feel currently like I am a loser, always make mistakes, always am alone and my only friend is an animal that actually isn't capable of loving me. 

&#x200B;

Thanks all. "	Taxus_revontuli	post	21.444314181387583	female	White	0.9974268078804016	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

"I'm an entrepreneur, and after a couple of years of burnout, my condition has significantly worsened 3 months ago, and I've been diagnosed with moderately severe clinical depression. I've been having an indescribable feeling of sorrow, anxiety, apathy, helplessness and emptiness; in the first week of the whole episode, it was even hard to get out of my bed. For the past 3 months, whenever I tried to work (or even just thinking about work), I would experience immense anxiety, fear, anger, as well as physical symptoms, such as massive headache, body tremors, and faster heart beats (and one time, almost hyperventilating). The trauma around anything remotely related to work has been significant (I scored 70 out of 80 on DSM-5 assessment); to date, I still can't open/reply email, or think of anything/anyone around work at all, since all of these give me tremendous fear and anxiety.

Around 6 weeks ago, finally decided to take a month off work (totally offline), to try to recover. I was supposed to go back to work after one month, but I've continued to struggle, coupled with flashes of suicidal thoughts. To make matters worse, there was some emergency at work (happened during my leave) that I would need to attend to -- and it was going to be extremely stressful. Hence, I decided to take a couple of extra weeks off, and during the past six weeks, because of the severe trauma, I've eliminated all direct contact with folks at work (including my business partner) and my friend was helping as liaison point.

As I'd have to come back to work soon -- regardless of my decision, whether to officially extend my leave, depart from the company, or something else -- I've been getting hints that folks at work, including our shareholders, have somewhat been upset with me, as I've been fully offline (in the past, I've always been very online & responsive even during weekend and time off). I briefly shared with them that I'm ill and would need some time off, although I didn't share the details as I was afraid of repercussions to the company (except my business partner, who knows everything). But now, I've a feeling that they would start blaming me and pinning me for all the problems that have happened at the company over the past 6 weeks (and there were a couple of them, while I was away).

A part of me feels guilt for taking time off and went completely offline, as I know some people were probably upset by that, but at the same time it was something I needed, as I was desperately struggling, and who knows, if I haven't taken that break, I'll probably not be here writing on this forum now. I also question whether I should have been more transparent, but there was no one ideal choice, and my business partner wasn't supportive of transparency at that time either.

What would you have done if you were me?"	throwaway-78285	post	29.239868715423995	male	White	0.9915117621421814	na	na	na	4	MentalHealthIsland

"Coming to a realisation that I'm just failing day after day breaks my hope.

Failing at everything since school up until now and ruining my life. And feeling powerless even for a slight change. It's really hard for me to believe that I never did a right thing in my life. I wish I could change that but I can't, I don't want get into why I can't because it's so complex to explain.

All I know is that there's nothing like, one step at a time, for me. It doesn't exist for my situation.

When I wake up and I know that day I'm going to get destroyed by everything, both outside and inside... when this pattern just continue over and over while I am unable to change it... then only my dark side talks to me.

I wish I wanted to lie but I don't feel any hope for me. I never got better and I just got worse and I know I can't do anything about it. I know that I will never like or know myself

We don't see you that way.  We see you as brave and kind and someone always ready to pick up someone else when they're down.  I know you've done that for me.  And many others.

I feel like there‚Äôs a switch in my brain, I go back and forth between wanting to be with/around a friend or my partner forever to wanting to leave them and never speak to them again. Like when I first got to college my best friend wasn‚Äôt answering or returning my phone calls (she would answer my text tho) and one night I just snapped. She didn‚Äôt answer my phone call and I felt a switch of emotions for love to just angry and frustration. I was so upset I almost blocked her on everything I just started to cry and my brain kept telling me that I would be better off without her friendship, but then the minute she called me back the next morning all those feelings went away and I was right back to loving her so deeply. And with my boyfriend he didn‚Äôt answer my call and said he was busy I accused him of lying and that he just didn‚Äôt wanna talk to me; I got really mad and started yelling about him to my siblings (he wasn‚Äôt lying he was actually busy) but when I seen the proof that he wasn‚Äôt lying and that he was actually busy I felt guilty for getting so mad and switched back to being ok and not being mad at him. Everyday I go through fazes with friends and family where I will see a change in tone either in person or over text and I get defensive and want to cut them out of my life. I know this way of thinking is toxic and yet I can‚Äôt stop it from happening.	Helpful_Song_4666	post	19.524618766523496	female	White	0.0040231854654848576	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

I completely understand how you feel. This is how we defend ourselves from disappointment and getting hurt. If you have already decided that the reason someone is not texting you is your worst fear, they can't possibly tell you something that could hurt you even more. By trusting in the moment that someone might really just be busy we are leaving ourselves vulnerable to the unknown that may be more hurtful if that doesn't turn out to be true. Have you looked into attachment theory and attachment issues in relationships? I went through the same thing, and attachment theory helped me name and understand those feelings that were coming up in relationship hiccups. There is an instagram profile, thesecurerelationship, which was a great intro to me about attachment theory.

I‚Äôm not sure what it‚Äôs called or if anyone has the same thing. So I figured I would make my first Reddit post hoping someone could help. But I have a thing where my body just disappears it‚Äôs like I can still feel things physically but everything is gone. I just feel like I‚Äôm numb. It freaks me out it happens all the time even if I don‚Äôt have any kind of anxiety/stress. It‚Äôs like a light switch that just flips. I recently figured out a way to kinda explain it. It‚Äôs like being in first person (just see stuff normal) then I‚Äôll switch to 3rd person like I see everything around me. I hope that makes sense ü•∫. Idk if it‚Äôs depersonalization or something else. When I try to google it comes up with depersonalization but I don‚Äôt feel like it explains how I feel. I feel like I turn into a ghost. I don‚Äôt know why it switches when I‚Äôm not worried about anything. I‚Äôll just be watching tv and then it switches. When I‚Äôm not focused on it will switch back to being normal. It‚Äôs just kinda hard not to hyper focus on something that you feel. It‚Äôs an awful feeling especially since it happens all thru out the day. I think if I knew what it was and that other people have this also it would make me feel better about it. It‚Äôs kinda scary to have something wrong and have no idea what it is. üò©	killerkharma	post	18.841750164665108	male	White	0.9988038539886475	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

"Hej,
I can understand that's kinda scary. I rarely have something similar, but for me it happens when I am overall/generally stressed, but right in that moment it's a ""neutral"" moment. Like, let's say I have had a few hard weeks but right then, i just want to go shopping and -bam!- I feel like in a third person video game and there is no mental connection to my body anymore, that's not me. Is it similar for you? 

I have to admit though, for me I suspect that it comes from how stressfull my past months have been, while for you it seems to have gone on for longer already? Always remember, it's no shame to go to a psychologist to get a diagnosis, just as you would go to a doctor to get a diagnosis if you feel physically unwell. 

Take care of yourself!"	killerkharma	reply	na	na	na	0.9988038539886475	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

Have you ever felt so lonely that you didn‚Äôt want to be alive? I have. Maybe it was when my mum and dad started to forget that I was there. Or the moment my brother lost his way in grief and turned my innocence into abandonment. Ever since I was little all I could remember was how easy it was for people to have friends unconditionally.
Never having to worry whether their mum or their sister would stop thinking about them. No one ever sat with me in school or work. No one gave me passing compliments and stuck by my side. Sometimes when I‚Äôm by my self I wonder what I did wrong in a past life to deserve this. I am in a constant state of paranoia and self doubt, ridiculing and justifying every way I am the observed and not engaged. Constant state of justifying why I am the way I am. The first time I remember feeling lonely was when I was 6 in pre-primary. There was one time (out of many experiences with failed friendships) when I thought I was with friends in my class.

I couldn‚Äôt say yellow properly. It just came out like ‚Äúlellow‚Äù. My gut tore and my confidence was shut down when everyone mocked me. I know that I‚Äôm not interesting or worth wanting to be around but it was like getting kicked in the stomach. Throughout school kids made fun of me, be it was my home life. Or the colour of my skin or the way I looked. It chews me up that no one will ever look at my eyes and wonder what I‚Äôm feeling. It cuts me deep knowing that I‚Äôm always the last option. That no one will exchange soft kisses with me or call me when they need a partner in crime. 
 
I try to remember that no one is responsible for my happiness and that one day once I die, my accomplishments and failures wont matter. Theres nothing really to lose. The grass is always greener on the other side but fuck, loneliness sucks."	SafeInside6750	post	21.441135045383444	male	White	0.9952901601791382	na	na	na	5	MentalHealthIsland

"Loneliness is for sure difficult. There isn‚Äôt any way to sugarcoat this. But, at least to me, it‚Äôs far better than superficial and transactional relationships. 

I had a group of friends I‚Äôd made in my postgrad but over time, we just didn‚Äôt click. They were a large group and I knew there were people in the group who strung along for the sake of being included. That‚Äôs how daunting loneliness can be. But it‚Äôs a bit sad, too, if you think about it. 

I don‚Äôt have a lot of authentic relationships in real life and every effort I make is futile since people want things to happen instantaneously but that‚Äôs not entirely possible. You‚Äôve gotta put time and effort into relations and that just doesn‚Äôt seem to be something people want to sign up for. 

It wasn‚Äôt until I met the amazing people in this community that I thought ‚ÄúSo healthy people who are capable of cultivating and nurturing healthy relationships **do** exist.‚Äù

"Hey Safe ü´Ç I want to say that I can relate to these thoughts in a different life of mine. Whenever my mind starts shattering and I don't have control over it, the worst moments come to my mind, that how I felt weird and different in school, with parents, uni, work... everything just connecting my thoughts and thinking that I am not human. Feeling like I am something that I can't recognise myself, a shape without soul. It was always hard for me to understand that how people  I saw in my life, can connect and talk... but I couldn't understand that. Feeling like a lonely shade in a dark world. It was like nobody could understand me. I feel this everyday and I just try to not completely disconnect from myself but most of the time I just fail.

"Safe I can totally relate to this.  I am a work in progress right now.  The biggest task that I am working on now is self love. I have lived a life ever since grade school trying to accommodate others to be accepted when I should have just been true to myself even if that meant playing tether ball solo during recess. 
Where I am at now in life has stories of success but tbh not a large amount of friends.  I remind myself that there are people around that are here to support me if needed but these same people can not love me anymore than I can love myself. *remind yourself of this*
I've found that meditation and mindful deep breathing help me to see my situation differently. It also helps me to realize that my thoughts that I have can be seen as just that, thoughts.
These thoughts do stem from your subconscious due to things that have happened in your past. Just know that you are worth so much, you are cherished and valued. 
Try to discover some things that you enjoy. Some hobbies that you can do by yourself. I've just started scrabbooking and am loving the creative spark that I have discovered."	SafeInside6750	reply	na	na	na	0.9952901601791382	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
"I'm seeking out bad habits again, and internally I'm screaming at myself to stop. I dislike when I get these ""episodes"" where I just want to run into chaos and dig myself deeper in a hole. 

I just want to drink, do drugs, and just ultimately feel numb. 

The difference in this now is that I'm not even remotely sexually active. I crave intimacy sure, but at this moment solidarity is nice. In this moment I want a connection, yet I'm afraid of how that connection will blossom. . I just don't want to waste time.

"Lately, it feels like I have to seek out everyone else, and the moment I stop nobody cares enough to come after me. Everything goes dark; no phone calls, no texts, no messages, nobody stops by. Nothing. Just silence, forever. While I like to relax... I'm socially awkward as all hell... I hate being alone... But that just seems to be how people like it. Leaving me entirely alone. Days, weeks, months. If I don't directly message a friend, its like I stopped existing. I just dissappear from their lives. And, of course, I would never harm myself, but so far the only times people seem to come after me is to check and see if I'm dead.



Im not saying people are bad for not trying to talk to me frequently. Logically, they are just... Quiet. Or don't know how to start. Or socially awkward. Or busy. But it sure doesn't ever feel that way.



I feel like ive become a ghost in my own life. Nobody really tends to seek out ghosts. But it seems ghosts sure like to seek out others.

"I had a chat with an ex friend. They never gave me the reason for why they left me, so today, many months past our break up, I messaged them.

I just asked for what happened. And they gave me their reasons. While I have my side of the story as well, it hurts so bad to lose someone important to me.

And the worst part is that they don't want to hear me out, and don't care anymore, they just want nothing to do with me.

I don't ever wish to break a boundary, so I can't share until they want to hear. Which they don't. So I said nothing. I just thanked then for their help during a crisis I had. I said I was sorry that the last impression of our relationship was so terrible and I said goodbye. Friendship over.

Feeling lost. Feeling alone. Feeling as if it would be better to simply go away and become a zombie. Feelings can be extreme. 

Feeling also as if I'm a villain, or supremely selfish. I don't wish to be either of those things, but maybe I can't help it. Maybe despite my desire to be nice, I'm just wired to be an asshole. A selfish self centred asshole.

What's the point of making friends with people if I'm only going to hurt them? I don't want to hurt those I'm close to. I don't want to be alone either but...

"Well I don't think that you are selfish if you actually kept your feelings to yourself because you didn't want to overstep boundaries! It's more than I could have done. It's actually rather selfless. 

I know the feeling that you just want to stop... Feeling. I also feel lost and alone. I think I would be proud to have a considerate friend like you. 

I think it's now time to keep going, even if you feel like it's for nothing. Do you have some kind of interest that can be combined with a social event - like sports courses or crafting courses where you could join? You will not immediately make friends there, but occupy your mind, have social interactions and over time perhaps make new friendships. Just keep going even if you feel like you can't. I know it costs so much strength, and feels like such an effort to Google, let's say, ""local pottery courses"" or ""local jogging/running groups"" but give it a try. You can do it. Then the first time actually going there will also feel like a struggle. And the second as well. But after the third, you might start looking forward to it. You got this.

Keep going. You are strong and you are on the right path - the first step, getting help from a psychologist, is done, because you are brave and have courage. Just keep going. One day the sun will shine and you will sit down in a park or at the seaside or on a warm rock and it will feel real again, promise. You will put on your favourite song and it will feel real again, promise. You will admire the colour of the sky, and it will feel real again, promise. Just one day after another, you can do it.

"Because I don't know when the internet and/or power will go off again, I wanted to give a brief update to the situation where I am.   


A confirmed EF-1 tornado hit my area in the early morning hours 6/16. This was strange to me because I'm a trained weather spotter and did not see this on radar, nor was the tornado warning called; it was only mentioned for the first time yesterday, as far as I know.   


The area I live in looks like a warzone. Huge trees are blown out of the ground from the root, parts of trees are literally everywhere. Multiple power linemen have been brought into our area to try to restore power, but because of all of the debris everywhere, things are slow going.   


A huge tree fell on my property but did not hit the house or any structures, which is a miracle. I will have to deal with this when I am able.   


I had a window blown out at the back of the house, which has been repaired.   


There is currently intermittent electricity and internet but reception is still poor.   


I lost every bit of food I had i the freezers/refrigerator. We had aquariums and over half of our fish died, despite our best efforts to keep the tanks cool and aerated. That  has been really hard.   


And there is vandalism afoot-- the catalytic converter was stolen off one of the vehicles, which is at least a 2,000 replacement-hoping the insurance covers part of it for vandalism. Costs are adding up quickly...but I'm  hoping insurance will cover some of all of this.   


All of this and dealing with temperatures of 95+ degrees F, and trying to stay cool/hydrated/fed (grocers are out of ice/water/food and fuel, so we've had to travel about 2 hours out of town daily for supplies).   


I am hot and miserable, heat-exhausted and feel sick. Blood sugar is also an issue as I cannot eat properly, so it keeps dropping and I get sick, then it gets too high at times--which has other issues...so I'm in a perpetual state of exhaustion and survival mode.   


My (ex??) partner and I have been helping each other through this, for which I am thankful. We make a pretty good team in dark times, actually.   


I apologize for not being around but I simply haven't been able. I hope everyone is doing ok and I will try to catch up when I can. For now, I am miserable but safe, it could be much worse...so I am very grateful for what I do have.

"Hello there!  
I'm 20 years old and the last time that I was sure I knew what I wanted to do with my life was 10 years ago when I was convinced I would become a fairy when I grow up and fly around in the woods performing magic for people.

Soon after that I didn't even think I would grow up anyway, so I stopped thinking about big life and career plans and concentrating on just staying alive day after day. I've come such a long way since then, I'm at a point where I can say that I am genuinely grateful and happy to be alive. 

Still, I feel so incredibly lost. I see all of my old classmates and my friends go and build their life, start studying and working in fields that they are just good in. I used to work at a supermarket until a month ago. There is really nothing wrong with that, I really liked working there, but it didn't fulfill me, but I genuinely don't know what would. Maybe nothing ever will? 

I don't know if you guys feel the same, but when I think about certain people, I connect them to the things they are passionate about. My friend loves the ocean and diving and is now studying to become a marine scientist. My boyfriend's passion is football and just started his own business giving private lessons to kids. I don't think I have a thing like that.  
I see all of the people around me realise their dream, and I don't even have one. I feel like maybe I just don't have a personality. Maybe I'm just not meant to succeed, I've tried so many different things over the last year and nothing works for me. Of course I have some interests, but nothing really that can stand on their own. I'm really struggling to accept that, because I'll have to work for the rest of my life and I've just been thinking about how it's not fair that maybe I won't ever really enjoy what I'm doing.

I don't know what I'm trying to achieve by posting this here or if any of this even makes sense to you, but I'm currently looking for a new job and it's so frustrating and stressful to me."	zukosbikini	post	30.956323192400568	female	White	0.9918517470359802	na	na	na	5	MentalHealthIsland

"I'm an entrepreneur, and after a couple of years of burnout, my condition has significantly worsened 2-3 months ago, and I've been diagnosed with moderate to severe clinical depression. I've been having an indescribable feeling of sorrow, anxiety, apathy, helplessness and emptiness; in the first week of the whole episode, it was even hard to get out of my bed. For the past two months, whenever worked (or even just thinking about work), I would experience immense anxiety, fear and (sometimes) anger, as well as physical symptoms, such as massive headache, body tremors, and faster heart beats (and one time, almost hyperventilating). The trauma around anything remotely related to work is real -- I still can't open/reply email, or think of anything/anyone around work at all -- all of these give me tremendous fear and anxiety. Lately, I've been feeling resentment towards my business partner and team, as I believe I'm the most committed one and they have not been fully pulling their weight (which leads to my burnout). I've given everything to the company, and it hurts me to see that they cannot function without me.

Anyway, I've finally decided to take a month off work (totally offline), to try to recover. I'm supposed to go back to work, but I've been having an extremely difficult time getting myself in the right mind space to even think about work. To make matters worse, there was some emergency at work (happening during my leave) that I would need to attend to -- and it's going to be very, very stressful. A part of me strongly want to either leave or shut the company down, but even to do so (which would involve discussing with my business partner and all follow-up tasks) seems insurmountable to me now. Especially the last week has been difficult (potentially from thinking of going back to work), and there were brief flashes of self-harm thoughts. I can't bring myself to think or read (let alone respond) any message about work now.

"It's one of the most uncomfortable questions when you meet someone after a long time or meet someone for the first time. I know that's one of the ways to keep the conversation going or catching up but the real answers can be hard to get out. It leaves you so vulnerable because it starts this thought of 'oh my god I'm not doing anything, I'm wasting my life'. 

I'm going through something similar. I really need to remind myself that even if I don't have a 'traditional' full time job, considering the field that I'm in and my limits, I'm doing my best. 

Those limits can be very restricting. I have had to give up job opportunities, done horribly in interviews, change my desired work environment and profile. But in the end, it all helps me work my way towards something that will fit my needs. It sucks that corporate world doesn't take into account mental health concerns.

Instead, I got a blunt person on the other end telling me that I'm not trying hard enough to find a job and that Ken my ex-now roommate can treat me however he wants to, he can go out and he can lie to you, and you have to deal with it, or come home.   


Yes, I was severely crying out for help saying I don't wanna be here, all I got was that's a copout, do you want me to call the cops, and go call 988 they'll help you. As if either one of them has called them in their life.  They aren't helpful.   


I got angry hung up, and didn't wanna take another call, but did tell my own mom I don't wanna talk. Yeah, I know I threw a fit, but I learned that from her. Only she got away with it. The fit was because I don't want to let my Dad's stuff go, but she has my ""truth-telling"" Godfather and her going through it.  

&#x200B;

Dad has only been gone for four months, and she can't see how it affects me. The only time I had a say was with what I wanted.  


You see I've dealt with my Narsasictic mom forever. She used to throw fits if I tried to have friends, she would push them away, get angry because I wanted to be me, and harass me making me cry saying that's the truth. When she got angry she would follow me around the house daring me to hit her. She only stopped because Dad said she'd be the one to get arrested if she did get me to hit her.   


I had to raise myself through T.V. and movies. Because my dad was too busy working himself to death because my mom couldn't keep a job. She'd get angry and quit. No, that's okay with my godfather because she raised you. No, she didn't.  

This fight was the last straw even though  it started with my so-called godfather it ended with her trying to manipulate me with the ""I'm sorry you feel that way, or it's your problem if you can't handle me telling you the truth."" Manipulation is everywhere, and I can't handle it anymore.

She said I was to call her if I ever felt like committing suicide. This was the help from my godfather and her.  She's a liar and so is he.    


That was the last straw the camel's back broke in half. I'm never going to trust her again."	Candy__Canez	post	10.585267374086374	female	White	0.9993457198143005	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

I had posted here while back about feeling I'm drowning. I was recommended to seek help. And I did. I was doing really good but now I haven't been able to get back for a few weeks because of life and work and I'm down so far that I don't know what to do. I'm barely able to take care of my baby girl by myself. My mom has to help me a lot. Today I hit a complete low. I want to stop hurting. I want to stop having to fight so hard to survive. I'm tired. I'm worn out. I'm exhausted on so many levels. My baby girl has been having some health situations going on. I even ended up in the hospital for a few days due to health (spent my first mother's day in the hospital.) feel like I'm failing on every front. Just want to disappear.	cumminsgirl6081	post	25.03684640703154	female	White	0.9992710947990417	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

"I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through what you are. It‚Äôs not easy. 

Healing is not a smooth and linear process. There will be ups and downs. There‚Äôll be days you‚Äôll feel like a rock star and there‚Äôll be days where you‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôve barely made any progress. Unfortunately, there isn‚Äôt a shortcut to heal. To deal with the emotions, you have to go through them. Bypassing it only delays your response to it. 

You‚Äôre a strong person to be doing this in the first place. 

Doing this with a child cannot be easy at all. I recommend taking some time for yourself. 
Since child care takes the majority of your time, take some time, anywhere between 5-15 minutes, and do something for yourself. Do something that serves its purpose to YOU. 

It could be applying lotion, making yourself a glass of juice, doing your hair, writing a journal, meditating. But yeah, take some time to do something to do for yourself.üíô

I‚Äôm so damn proud of you, you‚Äôre so strong but remember that you‚Äôre allowed to fall apart, too. Any time you need support, we‚Äôll be here for you. üíôü´Ç

"Hey you gave up anyway .. tried to do the right thing and didn't work anyway you'll get yelled at anyway.... so the only option you have is to do what YOU want .. i mean you'll be to everyone around a suck up anyway so why not a suck up that does something at least they like? 

You are allowed to give up from trying to do things that are no longer working 
It's okay that doesn't mean you are a loser or good for nothing  ... it means you are fed up and burned out from doing things that you don't even believe in and you know you won't get the recognition and appreciation from anymore.. so giving up makes sense 

So I'm encouraging you to give up on trying to get someone else's gratification and appreciation to try to fit in their picture of how you should be and how you should please them 

And start to find what version of your self that pleases YOU. 

It won't be easy .. but it'll be worth it

"I'm an entrepreneur, and after a couple of years of burnout, my condition has significantly worsened two months ago, and I've been diagnosed with moderate to severe clinical depression. I've been having an indescribable feeling of sorrow, anxiety, apathy, helplessness and emptiness; in the first week of the whole episode, it was even hard to get out of my bed. For the past two months, whenever worked (or even just thinking about work), I would experience immense anxiety, fear and (sometimes) anger, as well as physical symptoms, such as massive headache, body tremors, and faster heart beats (and one time, almost hyperventilating). As a result, I've not been productive at work and in every sense of the word, dreaded it. The trauma around anything remotely related to work is real -- I still can't open/reply email, or think of anything/anyone around work at all -- all of these give me tremendous fear and anxiety.

I've finally decided to take a month off work (totally offline), to try to recover. However, I've been guilty about taking the break, especially with regards to our external stakeholders. Of course, I didn't just disappear; my business partner and the team know about my leave. But I've been thinking whether I should have communicated about the break with external stakeholders more properly -- which I did at a minimum because I didn't want to share about condition, which I was afraid may impact how people see the company. For me, the decision to take a break was like an ""emergency break"", because my condition got pretty bad and I was (and sadly, still am) extremely miserable.

Also, around this time I've had lots of guilt and shame around how I should have done better in my work for the past couple of years -- in operating the company, managing people, et cetera.At the same time, I don't think a month is sufficient. I was getting a bit better, but been back to worse again.

How do I overcome these feeling?"	throwaway-78285	post	27.409122023970884	male	White	0.996394693851471	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

"You deserve time away from work to sort out your own feelings and tend to yourself. Feeling guilty when you‚Äôve given so much of yourself and your time to your occupation and everyone attached to it is natural. It‚Äôs completely normal. Cut yourself some slack, thought. Feel guilty once and then let it go. Consciously stop yourself from going there. 

Taking time away is important. 

Now, you‚Äôre on holiday so try to spend as much time away from work-related stuff. Distract yourself, find an activity to do! 

Once you‚Äôre back in, I recommend taking at least 20 minutes for yourself. Spend those 20 minutes completely disassociated from work. Invest those 20 minutes towards yourself. Take a walk, have a cup of tea while listening to music or reading a book, heck, do nothing! But spend some time with yourself for yourself. 

Your work is important but so are your thoughts and feelings. They need validation, too.

For a few years, I've been dealing with suicidal ideation and thoughts and the last year, I met someone at work who has been a major emotional support figure to me and has really helped me at times when I needed someone, especially when I've thought about ending my life.

"Well, the problems arent your suicidal thoughts (they are a problem, don't get me wrong) but what is underlying causing them. Try to find out why you seek death and split it into small parts you can work on. Having small parts that you can work on is better as working on the big thing right away, as you see way more improvements that motivate you.

"A few days or so later after my twin brother passed away.

I didn't know that I would feel as helpless as I do with my own family, and yet they still don't seem to understand that we're all grieving differently. They had flown out to the other state where my brother passed away at and retrieved his belongings. They really want to unlock his phone, but I don't feel comfortable doing that at all. Even when I explained that I am not comfortable with being invasive with my dead brother's phone, right after he died, it seemed to strike a nerve that I wasn't on my family's wavelength. I do understand that they've to process things differently and that we're all sensitive, but I wish they didn't have to make me out as the bad person for not wanting to be part of unlocking his phone yet. I'm really having a hard time still accepting that he's gone. I still feel like he's here. I don't think they know how others grieve differently compared to themselves.

Then, it felt like they were gaslighting me to make it seem I was the one that needed to calm down. I was shaken but not angry with the idea of unlocking the phone, but my other brother made me feel like I was being unreasonable. He always said to ""put yourself in others' shoes to understand how they feel,"" but when I asked him if he understood how I felt, he looked at me and asked, ""what about you?"" As though everything I just said didn't click with him at all and that I was still being unreasonable when I explained again. *I HAVE to think of others first before myself*, is what his motto is. But that's what I did - I paid for their plane tickets to see our dead brother's coroner and to fly back home with his belongings. They wanted me to stay home and watch the baby brother of the family. I wanted to go but they insisted I stay behind. I get that is a commendable attribute to think of others before yourself sometimes, but right now, I feel like I'm full of pins and needles because I can't decide if I'm being a bitch or if I should feel valid for being afraid to do something they want.

When my brother left the room, a few minutes later, I asked my dad if I wasn't being helpful. He gave me a silent, ""I don't know,"" without looking at me. I just left my room and cried. I just feel so filled with regret that I said something wrong but I don't know why it has to be me that's the problem. Maybe I am the problem.

"I wasn't strong enough to quit all at once.  It was too hard. So I've had to manage an extremely rigid controlled taper, which still has  withdrawal issues but not as bad.  

The worst is the depression and anxiety.  I didn't realize how many triggers i encountered in a day to use (kratom). Get sad because I'm alone after work? Take some tea.  Need a boost at work to get through a presentation? Take some tea.  Intrusive thought of literally any kind? Take some tea.  

I realize that even though i was not taking large amounts, it's the frequency that got out of control around the holidays, when the sting of loneliness was just too much to bear. That's when i said screw it...i have to get through this somehow. And i did what i had to do to survive. But the price of peace has been steep.  

In addition to being more mindful of triggers and not giving in during those times, i has a procedure last week for nosebleeds and apparently it wasn't successful because this morning i had another one. So I'm trying to quit kratom and trying not to bleed out (dark humor).

Take care of yourselves. It's easy to feel like giving up.  I know i do these days.  I don't even know why I'm trying so hard most of the time, except i don't like facing a challenge that i don't beat.  I'm prideful that way, so it's really, really hard for me to accept i may be facing something stronger than i am.

It came to a point where I started to realize that these conversations weren‚Äôt healthy for me since they were impacting my mental health negatively. 

The way I could let it go was by realizing that making someone change their mind was not my responsibility. If someone has certain beliefs, it‚Äôs not my job to show them the ‚Äúright path‚Äù. 

I also limited my interactions with such people altogether. That helped me tons. 

Upon gaining that distance, my way of communication also improved. I no longer get angry for no damn reason. I still have debates here and there. But I no longer speak with the intention of proving someone wrong or trying to change their mind.

Try not to worry about those things my friend. If she already has a boyfriend, then just treat her like a friend. But if she doesn‚Äôt, then make the move since you feel so strongly about her.

"I don't know if my actions actually crossed that line, but it haunts me‚Äîconstantly. It pertains to a former internet friend. While I wasn't constantly trying to contact her (no more than a 2-3 times per month, at most), I *do* think I was too persistent overall. She blocked me on IG in January 2022, but not on any other website where we previously interacted. Nevertheless, I have not attempted to reach out to her since. I've really missed having her as my friend, and I sincerely hope that what I put her through didn't cause her as much distress as I'm worried that it did.

I believe I have a type of OCD that makes me see myself as a bad person, and I engage in all sorts of compulsions to try and alleviate the anxiety that stems from it. One of these compulsions is sending messages to people seeking some kind of reassurance that I *haven't* bothered them or worn out my welcome. I don't ask them these things directly, but I apologize or say things like ""I value our friendship"" to try and coax something out of them. I also have ADHD-PI, and part of that diagnosis is rejection sensitivity. The two feed off of one another, creating this intense fear of being abandoned and the resultant desperation on my part to prevent it from happening. Ironically, the most common obsession I experience with my suspected OCD is with myself stalking women, behaving in a predatory manner, making them uncomfortable, etc.

What sort of professional should I speak to about this? Who can I engage with for third-party insight into my behaviors, so that I can confirm whether I crossed the line or am blowing things out of proportion in my head?"

"I apologize in advance for grammatical errors and if this post seemed kind of all over the place.

My (18f) mental health has been rapidly declining in just a few months. I have been through a lot I have 4 siblings I am the youngest. We were abandoned by our father while our mother was pregnant with me. Our mother never really was the caring loving type she got us the bare minimum and called it a day she didn‚Äôt like when we would talk to her she would get an attitude when I was younger and yell at me If I tried to speak to her while she was doing anything. She would spank us with objects such as wire hangers belts our toys ect (that kinda stopped tho after we all got older although she still will threaten to ‚Äúbe our ass‚Äù from time to time. My mom picks favorites (I am not one of them) she projects her issues onto us if she has a bad day at work she will come home and find the smallest thing wrong and flip out on us call us ungrateful spoiled abusive brats and then she will start to slam stuff and stomp around the house. She‚Äôs emotionally neglectful, and when you do go to her with private and sensitive information she cannot and will not keep it to herself. Because of my lack of an actual healthy parental figure in my life it has caused me to be susceptible to grooming. I have recently come to be able to admit that I was being groomed by my best friends uncle. He is 40+yo married with multiple kids. He always gave me such sweet vibes and was very comforting (I met him when I was 16) after a few months of knowing him I got his number and he would give me rides home from work, during these rides he would often grope me and say inappropriate things (even when I would push his hands off and ask him to stop) but I would continue to make excuses for him in my head because I just wanted that comforting parental figure. I was able to distance myself from him after I turned 18 and moved away for college, but I never told my friends or family about what he would say and do. I didn‚Äôt want to get him in trouble and I didn‚Äôt want to get blamed so I figured it would be easier to just keep it to myself. When I was back in my home town for winter break I was sexually assaulted by a friend of mine. ||TW|| I got drunk and he was ‚Äútaking care of me, I let him sleep in the same bed as me but soon woke up to his hands down my pants I didn‚Äôt know what to do I continued to pretend to sleep for a few minutes (those minutes felt like years) when I realized he wasn‚Äôt going to stop I sat up and just left the room without saying anything. I ended up only telling 2 of my friends about it one I swore to secrecy and the other well she blocked me and hasn‚Äôt spoken to me since. After the assault I felt isolated and alone I tried to push what happened out sm so that at some points it feels like it wasn‚Äôt real like it was just a dream or like I wasn‚Äôt there (idk how to explain it I know logically it happened but another part of me is just detached from the whole situation). Anyways after the SA I couldn‚Äôt really sleep much I was exhausted and frustrated and just full of so many emotions. Because of my lack of sleep and intense emotions I ended up having an over the top mental breakdown over some slightly annoying comment my mom made to me before she went to work. I was sobbing in my room and just couldn‚Äôt stop I started to punch myself lin the legs and head and face (I used to do that when I was younger but hadn‚Äôt in a while) after a few hours of angry cries and hitting myself I fell asleep and just continued on as I was. I was trying my best to pretend like I was ok but with the feeling of so many emotions coursing through my body I started to cut my hands In hopes to cope, and after that first cut I haven‚Äôt been really able to stop I started cutting my palms and then moved onto my thighs. In this time I still pretended I was ok and went on as if nothing was wrong. I went back to college where I met my current boyfriend at the beginning of second semester and I like him a lot but he has pointed out to me some of my self destructive habits and behaviors of pushing him away and then pulling him back in when the fear of abandonment gets a little to much. I have noticed that I tend to go from liking him so much that I feel like I would die if he left to where I want to leave him and ruin him for doing something small like not answering my text fast enough. I don‚Äôt understand why I think this way, there will be a slight change in his tone and I will go through a wide range of emotions because of it. I go from hating him to loving him and needing him to be with me always. And because of these thoughts it‚Äôs made me look back on my previous relationships types (he‚Äôs my first real bf) but with my previous bsf‚Äôs I noticed I would act similarly towards them. But yeah I feel like this post is all over the place but I feel like my brain is constantly scattered so can someone please tell me what they think is wrong with me and why I‚Äôm so crazy.

Now my friend group has vastly diminished but i really wanted to visit a pride event, to just have fun and hopefully make chill connections. 
Here i am now, a bit frantically walking around the city, feeling quite lonely, quite insecure and scare about going and the negative selftalk has taken over. Feeling fat, thinking i dont deserve any person to talk to because i was an addict and things i have done in the past.

i have been diagnosed with depression since 10 years old. its been better for about a year since getting out of the hospital due to an od, meaning the thoughts arent as strong and i actually have pure happy moments. but at the end of the day, i feel empty. i feel like i have no emotions in my body, but all of them at the same time? im not sure how to explain it. but now that its getting to be too much again, im starting to think about all this stuff in the future. is it worth it? feeling like this? im not a strong person. the close people in my life tell me i am, but im not. i keep everything inside, im a very very strong people pleaser. but i have no idea how to take care of myself mentally. i need help.

I can understand that overwhelming feeling where we feel empty and so full of emotions at the same time.

I found talking with other folks really helpful. Especially friends. If you don't have friends/family IRL that you can trust, you have a community full of people ready to support you here ‚ù§Ô∏è.

Trust me, it is worth it. It's the little thing that keep me going, ya know? Seeing people around me laugh, seeing stray dogs wag their tail waiting for me to feed/pet them....

It is very easy to feel like a failure; a let down to the people close to you. And that's completely normal. It doesn't matter how far we fall down. All that matters is how we pick ourselves up.

"I need things to change.

I need all of MY pain to stop, right here, right now, once and for all. I have tried so. Fvcking. Hard. To pray and get better. I want to fix this world and this universe, I really do. But whenever I ask for things to change to whatever magical warlord there is in the sky, I'm always ignored. Always. I don't care about being called the good guy, I just care about the world's peace. I want the innocent humans to live long, happy lives. To live life as they want, as long as they aren't hurting themselves or anybody else. I want the other creatures on Earth to be at peace and not have to worry about being hunted. Most of all: I just want us to come together. All of us. Life doesn't have to be this way! If we could all just hold onto each other before we slip, then we can conquer anything. We could all watch the stars at night, y'know?

How could I ever be happy with me being happy, if others around me are not, and suffering? How? Tell me how. 

I want to live, I really fvcking do. There's so many things I want to see, do, and achieve. I have dreams and goals. Wants and desires. I want to be human, not a monster. I want my mind to work with me, not against me. I wouldn't be so morbid like this if things around the world weren't so morbid. I really freaking love this earth, I do. But I can't get comfortable here because NOTHING lasts. Not a damn thing. I can't live because the next second I'm wondering if the planets going to fall, or the world will end, or the sun will come too far, or whatever creatud us would just decide to uncreate us... Or if someone would just snap their fingers and like that, we'll stop existing... I'm scared.

I wanted to learn about everything. Our existence. Our purposes. And the secrets or the truth of this universe. But when I think about all of this, I start to go insane all over again. Actually, I'm breaking myself again and again. How can I ""pray"" if I don't know ""who I'm praying to""? 

I've tried su1c1d3 about 5 times... Still here. Od'd on Seroquel and trazadon once, then zyprexa, prozac, vistaril, and some other bullshit*t prescription meds I think they were called Zoloft or something. All these attempts, and yet I'm still f*cking here??? WTF. The people that want to die , don't. And the people that won't to live, die. Amongst prayers and even more attempts and thoughts of trying to die... I lived through all of it. And for WHAT? What am I? What am I meant to be? Why am I even here in the first place? I don't understand. I really don't. And yet... I keep seeing the truth. Over and over again. Why do I do this? Why don't I get answered? Why can't I just give up and di3??

Whatever. I have various mental illnesses. Horrible thoughts damn near everyday. Compulsions and sh*t. And I can't do another day of this-- actually I won't. So yeah, I need things to change. And they need to now. 

Tell me the truth. Is there a god? Is there a creator? Was there ever anyone out there? Is our purpose just to suffer? What is MY purpose? Why am I allowed to live after they aren't? Am I quote unquote ""chosen""? Why was I born... Etc.

If someone would just write a long a$$ list of these things , tell me to stfu, do what I want despite not knowing the truth while I'm still alive, say f*vck the world and it's creator, get my sh*t together and manifest/work for my dream life instead of worrying about the world/things I can't controll, take/regain controll of my power+ Etc. I'd do it. And I wouldn't regret it. 

(Also, I'm only 18 years old, so I'm probably naive, or just don't understand things that adults do because I'm younger. Maybe I'm too young to understand this world or whatever.

His death was so sudden and I'm so depressed knowing he died alone. We live in different states.

I'm trying not to ramble but this is so painful. I don't know what to do or who to speak to, it all feels like the world decided to fuck me over with the worst thing possible by taking somebody I loved away. I always think I'm ready for these things, but never did I think I would lose my own twin so soon. I wish it were me, I wish I died instead of him. He doesn't deserve to be gone.

I wish I could've told him that I loved him one more time. Nothing feels right anymore. I'm going to visit the place he passed away soon. I want to just say goodbye.

"I'm working through some big stuff, have health issues from neglecting myself, brain fog from severe anxiety and probably long haul COVID, and on top of everything, I just got a nasty sinus infection. 

1. My therapist has been pushing me to go for a physical, so I did, the day after I scheduled it! I'm still proud of myself.

2. I put ""I have a sinus infection"" and ""I'm going to the doctor"" in my head at the same time and remembered to also have her check my sinuses. 

3. She did check and said I looked fine, but then surprise surprise, I get a notification that my Rx is ready. Huh? 

4. I've taken one dose of antibiotics and I'm already feeling closer to human. Hallelujah!

He wasn't the best person. I came home today, and I was told he died. He's not my father, and hasn't seen me in years, but he was there until I left apparently. I was told it was like an attachment from birth or something, I keep crying. I relapsed today I was 20 days clean. I kinda new it was going to happen. Since this morning. It was going to happen. I just feel like I'm suffocating.  Like there's a hole in my chest. Like something left when he died. I barley new the guy. Not even my father but I was told that there was attachment from birth and that he was my siblings father. He and one of my brothers had the same name and I thought my brother died, which I have had nightmares about before.  I'm relieved that it wasn't him but I still feel like I'm suffocating.

"Some days are worse than others. Sometimes it's easier for me to hate myself and feel pathetic. 
My feelings were staggered, shattered, I felt alienated, and I couldn't feel my body.

Today I struggled a lot with intrusive thoughts, some worse than others and passing the time was all suffering. Sometimes it's not easy for me to handle this pressure and the devil didn't stop rambling. I started crying in bathroom and I felt even my tears didn't help. I just wanted so bad to punch my face or cut myself to just wake up from the nightmare. I planned to grab the blade and just talk to it, not to do something wrong but just to feel it. feelings didn't matter to me as well as my life. I slowly lost my hope in the other side of sanity. Shame, feeling worthless and the hatred... today wasn't a good day.

I may not believe that things get better and that's ok and I don't need to force positivity to myself. Thinking that everything right now is flooded makes me feel more calm"	Sin_Boom	post	22.841538014636527	male	White	0.9977739453315735	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthIsland

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having a hard time right now.

Moreover, all of us are in different time zones. As a result, the frequency of talks are varied at the moment. 

In the meantime, please feel free to vent out here in the space of the subreddit! Don‚Äôt be dejected if a live talk isn‚Äôt happening. 

We love that you find solace in the talks but it‚Äôs important to remember that the talks are an extension of the subreddit, not vice versa. 

Much love!üíô

"Hi all This is B1GR3D from discord, I had spoken on the 27th and was asked to update everyone on my situation when i have one. For Reference My brother is abusive to my mother and recently assaulted her and nothing was done by the police. I had called Victim Services on Saturday and got a call back today, They sent me resources and is going to be in contact with my mom in the next few days.

 I had also reached out to a friend of the family's that also used to be a police officer, he is a person we hold very highly in our lives and when I told him what was going on he made a plan to visit on Wednesday to ""Read him the riot act"" And remind him that my mom isn't the one who needs to press charges, that if there's signs of abuse the cops can have him charged and the crown (Court + I'm in Canada our terms are weird) will decide what happens to him. 

 This is where I am at and will keep you all  updated, on top the woman from victim services informed me to make a complaint every time he is abusive to non emergency when there's a fight and when I hear that he was abusive to my mom again I will make another report."

No one knows this about me, and most likely no one ever will. I am thinking of taking my life. The only thing keeping me from it is a good reason. I have a loving family and friends.

The health impact of long term COVID can be both serious and formidable. You could indeed be considered disabled by federal guidelines. You'd just need a healthcare provider to attest to it.

Having just been divorced last year after a thirteen year relationship, I can sympathize with *some* of what you may be doing through.

"My recent diagnosis helped me better to know myself and having a better understanding why I am going through these phases. In hospital they told me it even may take a few years to finally I can feel the results and gradually feel better. So logically I understand that. But I am not a logical person most of the time...

It's a few days I am slowly feeling hopeless. I even don't know how it started. I never know, it's always out of nowhere. I slowly can't recognise myself on the mirror, hard to explain. I am slowly feeling disassociated but still in some parts of me I am aware of myself but usually in these situations my dark side eventually covers all of my sight but it didn't happen yet. I know these signs and they are not new to me but I never learned how to cope with that.. seems impossible. So I started to fantasise about hurting myself, not as planning but as some sort of coping. I know it's not healthy but I try my best to feel better. 

I hope I can find something to do, something productive to give me satisfaction so I feel better about myself before my mind shuts down and I lose my perception of reality. I need to be patient"	Sin_Boom	post	20.529790671836196	male	White	0.9950963854789734	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthIsland

"Hi folks, 

Lately my mental health has been in a bad shape, mostly from being burnt out and some unfortunate events at work. I have been dealing with it myself, not involving my family in it, as they get too concerned.

One effect of this state in my life - has been the difficulty to get up, leave the bed and start working (I work from home, white collar job). Unlike earlier days, I struggle to get off the bed to do my morning routine in sync with my family - I hope you can sympathise with feeling ""to avoid the world as long as possible in the morning"". Recently I been going from bedroom to work-desk just 10 minutes before my first work-call of the day. 

Probably as expected, my family is not happy with this, and apart from worrying about it has resorted to name calling, calling me lazy, unconcerned about other's convenience, etc. 

I'm really trying to out of this darker period. How do I communicate this without making them too much worried (I don't wish to take their help, there life is already too much for themselves)?

Thanks... If you have any other suggestions for me that'd be great too..."	rikaro_kk	post	33.23461064673918	male	White	0.9944692850112915	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

Now that you are working from home you have no motivation to get up and take a shower. I think the way you are feeling is pretty normal for people working from home.  Maybe you should create a morning ritual that you might enjoy doing before work.  You could start getting up 30 minutes before work to sit outside and enjoy the morning. Also since work from home your family might expect you to do more household duties while you are working. Make sure to let them know you have job and they need to take care of household duties while you work. Also practice some self care. Treat yourself nicely and make sure your family treats you nicely. Calling you lazy is not right!	rikaro_kk	reply	na	na	na	0.9944692850112915	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
So, whenever I feel happy or joy, overwhelming guilt can pass over me. Whenever I hang out with my friends or family, I feel happy and makes me feel good to be alive. Yet, there are these waves of thoughts that are like, ‚Äúothers are having a bad day, you shouldn‚Äôt be happy‚Äù. I know that it true, there probably many these people on this world who are having a bad day or going through a bad time. So, I get the feeling I am not allowed to enjoy my life because there are many that are having bad days. It feels like I‚Äôm not worthy to have a good life or good days. I know this probably sounds weird and I don‚Äôt know why I think this way, it just happens.

"Truth be told I don't know where I go. It's like I'm stuck in limbo. In a perpetual state of... needing. 


Lost my job, no savings, fallen behind on car note, on phone bill, on other debts had to register with the food bank which honestly just felt like admitting defeat. Insurance for my car is running out, can't renew, so I'll soon be without legal transportation... (yeah car will shit in my garage, can't use it) sending out job app after job app and nothing, one interview where nothing came out of it, so that's bust. One friend... whose in the same boat, but at least he always has food in his fridge that hasn't either expired or gone bad, and a car he isn't worrying about getting repposesed.



It doesn't help that when I did have some money left to live with, I bought myself an Oz of kush (stoner... it's been my one saving grace here. Cause I'll just sit baked as hell sending out job apps not worried about anything. It's... relaxing) but my own fucking father has been practically BEGGING me to give him my weed and when I say no, because I know his habits versus my own, an Oz from just me smoking would last me like 2-3 months but now I'm low, he calls me fucking selfish for not letting him take it. Probably a third of that bag went to me, while 90% of the rest was taken by a combo of my father and best friend, but at least my bro respects me saying no...

"So last night, I was watching the new DnD movie with my family and I absolutely loved it. As a DnD fan, you can tell they wanted to have fun with movie. There was something fro everyone. It warmed my heart that they even made reference to the 80s cartoon. That‚Äôs awesome. After the movie, my brain started thinking about this war between wizards of the coast and 3rd party players, and ‚Äúburning DnD‚Äù or whatever.

However, I don‚Äôt really buy any of the books or whatever Wizards of the Coasts sells. I just have dice and a character sheet and if I wanted to make a campaign, I would research and just find out what I should do. I don‚Äôt really care. Yet, WOC is owned by Hasbro. I like to buy Transfomers toys, not often though. However, I‚Äôm pretty sure that Transformers and DnD are two completely departments of the company.

"I'm 24M & for the first time in my life I visited a psychiatrist. 

I told her my life's story and what I'm struggling with. She listened to me carefully, didn't judge & asked a few questions. 

For many years I had trouble concentrating while I study. I don't even know since when I had the issue. The doc told me it's probably from childhood. I tried to do everything as told by various people- eat healthy, sleep early, study in the morning, excercise regularly, etc. Everything had it's good effects but it didn't improve my attention. I was just too tired of doing all the things. I tried, I really did. But something was out of order & it wasn't my fault. 

Anyway, after the talk, she prescribed me certain drugs. Told me that it's okay. 

The drugs help on focusing throughout the day. I'm supposed to take them 6 times a week if I pass the blood tests. ( I need to pass blood tests to ensure that the drugs won't negatively affect me. )


Gosh, I was tired, I knew I wasn't stupid or lazy. I just couldn't focus. My mind would just wander off without my control. 

I'm glad I now have clarity. 

If anyone is on treatment right now, would you please hit me up? I would like to talk about your experiences- specifically related to the treatment and how it's helping you.

@outrageouscollar, thanks :)"	Entire_Blaze	post	32.11729468735989	male	White	0.0013474911684170365	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthIsland

"Wanted to share some accomplishments this fine day! 

I‚Äôve been deep in depression these past few months. Didn‚Äôt feel like getting up, cooking for myself, cleaning the house, so on and so forth. 

Well, today I feel like a total champ! I cleaned my house, my front yard, cooked a delicious meal for myself (roasted mushroom grilled cheese sandwich), and did the laundry!

It‚Äôs a constant battle but I‚Äôm so damn proud of myself right now. 

Now that‚Äôs accomplishment no. 1 and while it makes me very happy, it‚Äôs not as much as this one. 

I‚Äôve had eczema on my hands for a while. It usually makes doing mundane tasks pretty challenging for me. 

Well, I don‚Äôt have a washing machine at home cuz it‚Äôs just me and it‚Äôs a waste of money for just one person. I can hand wash them perfectly fine. Except wringing the clothes once they‚Äôre washed used to be a challenge. My fingers are yet to heal completely, but they no longer hurt when I wring clothes!!

Just wanted to share that today!‚òÄÔ∏è

You are struggling right now, and people who are struggling are worthy of compassion and kindness, right?

"I am a 27, almost 28 year old dude from Indiana. I had my first 2 mushroom trips a few months ago with my brother to work through some shit. He got a nice job in  Texas so that's where he lived my entire life, up till a few years ago when he moved to Arkansas. He came down a few times, but we went to see him for a week over summer every year once I was old enough. We had a terrible roach problem. He brought his family down once and one of his sons get a glue trap stuck to his head.

&#x200B;

We clearly needed help but he just went back home. I guess mom was too proud to ask him for help. As far as I remember he never offered to help us. He just gave us a distraction from our lives once a year. He even made a ""joke"" to my mom and sister one year. They were outside smoking and he said something about white trash. I didn't hear it myself though so idk exactly what he said.

&#x200B;

I've never been a social person. I always saw myself as a thinker. I started trying to be more social in hs cause everybody was really nice to me. Didn't have much luck. I was convinced that I knew what my problems were. I was wrong.

&#x200B;

1. I played alot of video games. Eventually decided I wanted to make a game. Starting thinking of ideas. One day at lunch in about 4th grade, I went to the bathroom. I started thinking to myself that socializing was pointless and that I'd be better off thinking of ideas.

&#x200B;

2. My teeth have always been bad. I had to get crowns on most of them when I was little. Got my front teeth pulled in jr high cause they were too big. I always felt self consious about them, but it got worse in hs.

&#x200B;

I was close with my mom when I was little. I would sleep with her on the couch. Put my arm under her head so I would know when she got up. She never seemed healthy though. Always smoking and working. Pretty much raised by my sisters, while I had to help them raise their kids. Became an uncle when I was 3. Mom was super bony. She would randomly need to throw up so I would have to get her a walmart bag.

&#x200B;

She somehow managed to make it all the way to my senior year. She had to go to the hospital one night, because she couldn't breath. She got out for a few weeks and went back in with sepsis. She got through that and woke up, but couldn't talk because of the tube, so she had to write. My brother tried to get me to hug her before we left one night, but I just wasn't comfortable hugging her. I justified it to myself by saying that hugging her wouldn't solve anything, so I didn't need to. She was there for about a month before my siblings decided that it was time to pull the plug.

&#x200B;

I lived with my middle sister for 4 or 5 years after that. In a trailer by the train tracks. She got into an argument with her daughter  almost every morning, so that was fun. Both her kids seemed to enjoy making each other mad. Didn't get out much except to go to my other sisters.

&#x200B;

My home was very unstable. 3 sisters. Always had kids around. Sometimes other people stayed with us. Their heavyset alcoholic dad moved in for a few years. He tried to strangle one of my sisters once for saying fuck. My mom and another sister had to pull him away from her. I didn't forget about that though. It just didn't seem like a huge deal to me, looking back. I did forget part of it though. 

&#x200B;

I walked past the kitchen counter and saw one of my nephews, probably around 5, standing there just watching the whole thing. I didn't want him seeing that shit, so I took him to my room and closed the door. Tried to just play around and pretend that everything was fine and normal.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My family moved when I was in first grade, so me and my sisters had to change schools. Within a year or two, one of my sisters decided to make me hang out with her friends brother because I didn't bring people over and they didn't live too far. It was fine at first. We'd play video games/with toys or play outside. I went over to his place alot too. Stayed the night sometimes as well...

&#x200B;

We were in bed one night, watching tv. He starting talking about ""playing with each other"". I wasn't comfortable touching his, but I let him touch mine. I think I liked it. His mom came in to check on us. She got a little upset and told us to get our hands out of the blanket. Then she left. She stopped at the door first though, and turned to me. She seemed to be looking at me with disgust.

&#x200B;

I completely denied that I had been molested throughout hs and then forgot about it completely. I was still in denial at first. I was more focused at the time on my anger with my brother for never being around for me and the rest of the family. I put Deadpool 2 on, on a whim at my sisters. Usually I would debate with myself what I should watch, but I went with the first thing that crossed my mind. Cried/teared up alot lol. Not long after, I started to begrudingly accept the truth. Once I did, I remembered about something that happened on my second trip that I didn't understand before. 

&#x200B;

I was trying to find something to watch to distract myself from the weird physical stuff I was feeling. Decided to put family guy on. Spent 5 minutes trying to figure out how lol. Finally get where I need to be and head to the first episodes. Start reading the titles. The first 3 said something about death and the 4th about murder. Think I'm tripping and decide I don't want to watch family guy anymore lol. Left me a bit scared. 

&#x200B;

My brother takes his headphones off a few minutes later and asks what I want to do. I wanted to put something funny on but I didn't want to fuck with the tv so I went with the first thing I saw that I liked. The first deadpool. I thought about putting the second one on since I had watched the first recently but my brother didn't watch it with me so I went with the first. Probably wasn't the best movie choice  considering how graphic it is though lol.

&#x200B;

I started feeling scared in the first scene. So much so that I decided to turn the light on ""to change the mood"" lol. Brother was annoyed and kept asking what was wrong. I even started acting like a child, balling up and just making noises when he would ask what was wrong.

&#x200B;

Then I started repeating two words in my head. Haunted and Spooky. I didn't understand what they meant, until I finally accepted that I was molested. As soon as I accepted it, I remembered about those 2 words and finally understood why I started thinking about them. I even imagined a glass shattering sound when I realized lol.

&#x200B;

My ""friends"" name was Casper.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There have been many good things happening recently though. Many coincedences. I feel pretty hopeful about my future now. 

&#x200B;

I'm planning on going to a therapist and I'm going on a retreat with my brother for his birthday in a few months which will include mushrooms, but I'm just so tired of carrying this shit around so I decided to just get it out on here."

You don't list past crimes but it is hard to build trust once it is broken.  It might be a long process but don't give up. Maybe you did bad things when you were younger and are now mature.  Start small being kind to all who are around you. Look into finding programs that help people get back into society. Churches are a good place to look.  Do some self reflection. Answer the questions why did you do bad stuff? Something must have caused you to choose the wrong path. Once you come to terms with what you did and why you did it you can learn to forgive yourself and learn to love yourself.

"I've been recently engaged, and I'm super nervous.

First, I have a lot of preoccupation and anxiety about whether I'm worthy as a human being in terms of having a partner. A lot of my online research indicates you MUST be attractive to have a partner - there is a lot of good analysis of how you have to have a lot of sexual marketplace value in order to be worth anything. All day I notice little bits of data - for example, someone who might otherwise say that we should treat everyone equally will then make small comments about the hotness or unattractiveness of another person...based on this, attractiveness has to matter on if we look at things purely logically, empirically, and rationally.

Now, I am not quite worth anything due to several issues that would severely hinder my sexual market place value. I am a firm believer that everything is objective, all things can be quantified, and there is little to no value in wu-wu qualitative assesments. The onus is on me to be genetically fit to be attractive to others. This appears to me, on an empirical level, to be how our species works - we replicate the best of us and the rest of us are weeded out.

So, now I find myself engaged and the person I'm with finds me attractive and I can't explain it because it doesn't fit into a lot of the online material that I have studied and incorporated into formulation of how we as a species are supposed to work. Now, I feel like I am stealing something because there is no way a person who is so worthless such as myself (I am not tall, excellent model good looks, nor rich) should have a fiance. And I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop - that she will realize she made a mistake and that she accidently picked a worthless person and will decide not to marry me. And i will be crushed."

"How have I been so blind? I‚Äôm 52, have wonderfully successful kids 24,22 and 18. Married to a surgeon. Had a great career in the OR. Despite being an educated person I am just understanding all the autism in my family. I was adopted at birth. My mother was mostly deaf but also educated and earned a Master‚Äôs from UNC Chapel Hill in the early 1960s when few women did. I still care for her in my home and also cared for my father until he passed in 2020. While caring for mom, and when dad was ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù, his behaviors started to stick out to me as so odd. Doctors and my own children posed that he had autism. He‚Äôd been kept quieted by mom my whole life. When she lost the ability to speak he started speaking unchecked. 
I knew dad was a bit different. I thought it was his ‚Äúcountry background‚Äù. Yet he was a successful man having retired from a government job and had amassed about 50 rental properties. Through many different situations plus hindsight. It was obvious the healthcare professionals were correct. Dad had been autistic for 84 years before he was diagnosed. 
That was a surprise to me yet it made so much of my childhood make sense. My cousin then revealed how her dad (dad‚Äôs brother) didn‚Äôt speak until he was 10 years old. And not in full sentences for another year or two. He spoke differently but I just thought it was a very country accent. It‚Äôs so obviously a pronounced speech impediment as I see now. 
Just recently, after a visit with my daughter and my (mom‚Äôs side) uncle and his adult son we realized he is autistic. We knew he was different. He‚Äôs been diagnosed with dyslexia as a child. He‚Äôd had the benefit of extremely expensive private schools and then boarding schools and therapists to help him succeed. Despite 6 years of college he was never able to graduate. Now I am looking back at many other uncles and cousins and a grandfather I have only heard stories about and I can clearly see the autism is pervasive. 
I was always treated as an outsider even though I was successful in school and otherwise. I was made to feel less than. I knew I could never do anything right enough. I‚Äôm just very sad. There is a reason that there was so much turmoil in my family life and why I never felt like I truly fit in. I was loved and I know that. But we were odd. I left my house at 17 for college and never went back. It took a few years to learn how to interact normally with people though I only see this in hindsight. 
It‚Äôs just so surprising you can be so close to a situation and not see the reality. It makes me sad for young girl me, but happy I now understand."	Real-Ad-9926	post	29.975157013325386	female	White	0.03065781481564045	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

I know the feeling. My mom is in her 60s and it wasn‚Äôt until very recently that my oldest sister told me she‚Äôs probably autistic. Every autistic person is so different. They say if you‚Äôve met one autistic person, congrats, you‚Äôve met one autistic person. There is hardly a template you can apply to every person with autism. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a spectrum of abilities with some issues being more prominent than others.	Real-Ad-9926	reply	na	na	na	0.03065781481564045	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
I have been struggling with my rumination-focused OCD, in which my compulsive behavior is ruminating. I am trying my best to resist ruminating as part of exposure response prevention therapy.

Hello everyone my name is Josh and I am a 40 yr old man and I live in Kentucky .Im hoping on receiving some much needed help. I recently quit my job in the middle of January and my wife and I moved in with my my grandmother and I became her caregiver . She can go days and be perfectly fine other than forgetting and losing everything l but like the flip of a light switch she can think I am mean to her or I‚Äôve stolen her things which is completely untrue . She will get so mad at me because she truly believes these awful things . I don‚Äôt know what to do or how to handle these situations . I love my grandmother to the moon and back but it is really causing tension between my wife and I . My wife can‚Äôt stand my grandmother because my grandmother makes all these awful things up and then tells people these things . Luckily no one believes her . I just feel so lost and discouraged . I‚Äôm so lonely I have no one to talk to I‚Äôm here all day and into the night with just my grandmother and myself because my wife works a lot . So I‚Äôm basically just here all alone day and night. Even though my grandmother is technically here yes but I can‚Äôt really have a conversation of any meaning with her because she forgets things so quickly . I‚Äôm just lonely and really need some one to talk too . Anybody	Restless-toy1786	post	9.71957456475567	male	White	0.9982471466064453	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

"Does anyone think havin' the mindset, "" if it helps do it regardless of how your viewed or how anyone feels"" is the mindset to have? 

I'm sayin' that because ever since moving away from my toxic relationship and havin' to adjust to life not being completely weak-minded has honestly been hard. Internally and I cant just keep putting the crap on the back burner because it mentally and now physically bothers me. Everyday I'm constantly worried about my medical condition with me havin' epilepsy, trying to figure out work and then jobs. The crap has taken literal months and honestly I'm in and out of wanting and not havin' enough dedication to do anything. I have a job I'm working but its not enough for bills. It's not enough for a car wanting to drive, then with that I'm scared because I know I'll be put on curfew I know it's a possibility behind the wheel even with a focal aware seizure that I could crash and die but I need to drive to get places the bus takes forever and most good paying jobs are out the way of where I stay. Some buses don't even go that far havin' a car is a need. Then I'm havin' to deal wit the person I live with, their under stress themselves and have done the upmost to care for me. Their getting tired because shits goin downhill even for them to carry and they have people who are playing around as if the person doesn't have to deal with the aftermath. And with all that it's coming down on me havin' been as reliant as I've been on the person. They are tired of caring it's alot for them and I can understand I've seen alot these past months but like leaving won't make it easy especially for me, then it's like I'm proving I don't care. But staying only makes it seem like I don't care and I'm being lazy when in fact I have mental issues goin on everyday, I'm waking up with a pounding heart if I'm not completely alone when I'm around people I have heavy focal aware seizures off of getting too overwhelmed. That's at work that's when I'm really only ever around people I work customer service. I have bad social anxiety for needing to get a better job and a car and take care of myself I have that to worry about by myself besides the other person and their Problems. Yes I can understand their problems physically have shown their bigger than mine because the person has to constantly make stuff happen. But at the same time even though Im not doin what they are I still have my own issues I'm trying to ignore to move around like them but my issues are creating a road block because there are easy fast ways I can be financially stable but that will create more problems. Then there's doin it the right way which is a slow process because finding good paying jobs takes a while especially bein epileptic and non driving. Am I making excuses can I jus force myself to do things even if I know mentally it's Gonna backfire and turn physical on my brain and body please I need real answers."

This mindset sounds logical and quite healthy in my opinion. I say this because you live for YOURSELF not for others: you have to feel good about yourself not about others. 

also you can't compare yourself to others: you are your unique person, your flatmate is their unique person, etc. just last year i learned that when help is offered to me, i have to just accept it."	Dreadedupdej	reply	na	na	na	0.9920652508735657	no	no	strong	na	MentalHealthIsland
"     So ima just keep this short, but most of my life I‚Äôve never gotten attention from my parents. That‚Äôs do to the fact my mom had many jobs and was still in college while my father was an addict. I think this is where it came from I‚Äôm pretty sure. But according to my mom I have an addict personality, and to be honest I don‚Äôt disagree with her I have been addicted to many things and not only just the harmful stuff but specific foods and things that might not seem harmful. But they can most definitely be in large quantities. 
     The reason why she said this is because she has plenty of evidence to support it. I have always been addicted to something ever since I was a kid I had an addiction wether if it was bad or good I had always had one. Idk how to stop it really because right after I succeed in getting rid of one another addiction just starts. So if anyone has and idea of something that would help me or been through this it would be nice to hear that I‚Äôm not the only person that has this problem."

I Used to Love video games and Building Things in my garage and working on projects on my house.

"My mom passed 9 years ago (i was 40F), courtesy of the big C. I'm not making light of it. Maybe I should reconsider the first sentence?

But maybe not. Is it apropos of how i felt about my relationship with her?  My relationship with my mom was so messy, that I find myself second-guessing every statement. Every thought. Every sentence. Every emotion. Every feeling. Every opinion. Screw it. The first sentence stands. 

When she died, I was holding her hand. The last thing we said to each other was, ""I love you."" After I signed all the forms and arranged for the first call, in my car in the parking lot, I exhaled a guttural scream, a primordial, mournful wail I didn't know I could produce. It was reflexive. I don't know where it came from, but it was the most genuine emotional response I have ever had in my life. 

Up to that point, I was guarded with her. I didn't trust her to put my needs first. I always knew she's was an amazing mother when someone could see her. In the quiet moments, when, at 14, she threw me out because her husband didn't like me...  a few years later, when she told me I wouldn't have a family unless I had an abortion...  calling it ""messy"" is an understatement, a term I chose that's less affrontive than a term more befitting, but also more caustic. 

Tomorrow is Mother's Day. It is also her birthday. I've intentionally avoided making plans. I don't know how I'll feel, and I don't want to have to contain unexpected emotions around other people. Maybe a little isolation, but more freedom to do me. 

I have no idea what to expect or how to feel."	RockieRoo916	post	25.36730817713795	female	White	0.9796859622001648	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

Quite recently, I have had the opportunity to be in a supportive role for three adults who are struggling with current-day abusive relationships. They do not know each other, but they all have childhood trauma in their past.

We are a society of instant gratification. I wish that applied to parents with young children so they would immediately see what their behavior will blossom into, when their child is 45 years old."	RockieRoo916	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9796859622001648	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

OP, your story is sad, I cannot imagine the pain you are going through, it really hurts me to read your husband is refusing to help you out. I wish I can give you better advice, but I can't.

"At this stage, your wonderful rescue cat is an excellent focus. She's counting on you.

You've dealt with some really painful life events, and are facing some new ones. I can't imagine how hard that is. 

I went through a divorce last year and my attempt to live alone didn't really work. Now I'm living with friends. I'm very lucky in that sense. 

Would it be worth telling your friends about your situation? Even if they can't help, maybe they know someone who could. 

Some larger employers offer employee assistance. It may be worth talking to someone in human resources, if that's an option in your position. 

Country assistance might be available, if you haven't already sought it out. I know the wait list can be quite long. If nothing else, maybe do a roommate search?

If you can do it, consider calling your creditors. Any amount of money they can get is better than nothing. It may be worth your while. 

The bottom line is, you're irreplaceable. We see that. You're going through wracking life changes and your cat is one of your main concerns. I think that speaks to what a lovely person you are.

Your cat sees how precious you are. You've given her a sense of love and security she's lacked in the past. 

The hardest part of your situation is that *you're* still the one who has to figure out how to live through it. 

I desperately wish I had more for you. I realize it's unlikely I have anything to suggest that you haven't already thought of.

So, I‚Äôm not someone who likes arguments. I don‚Äôt like hearing them or making them. I mean sometimes there are fun arguments. Like, who would win, Batman or Superman? Those types are fun because I can learn more about that person. I mostly mean arguments with jerks. Like, I mean people who are rude about others based on who they are or where they from. I just want ti do that because that gives them more power. There is also a least likely chance to change their mind. However, mean words don‚Äôt matter, the people who say the nice things or treat you right, do matter. I don‚Äôt know if this is weird.

start with grace. give yourself grace.

if your body is tired it's indicating a need that might not be sleep but it doesn't know how else to tell you. maybe you have some habits you do recognize need changing?

studies say if we wait to check our phones after waking we'll become more productive (i've tested this a little and it does appear to help. i read someone recommend turning the phone colour display into grayscale to make the phone less interesting. i've not tested this much yet, but it does feel calmer to me.) so that just might be a place to start

"It's a weird feeling. It is raining heavily outside my bakery shop where I have recently started working. Just a moment ago, it was hot and sticky, but now the sky is dark and gloomy. It's 6:30 pm and nothing describes a good day or a good mood.

However, I feel a slight happiness and a small voice whispering to me at this moment - 'I love myself!'

Perhaps it's because I used an AI chat to generate a 5-page children's story, and it's giving me one page at a time. I am planning to challenge myself to draw those pages and publish them on Amazon Kindle. Something is calling me to do so, maybe after watching a couple of YouTube videos, but what matters is that I am interested in it.

I think I can do it, and that may be why I have this voice. I might be paranoid to think that it's the voice of my 'inner child,' who finally has an adult version of me agreeing to do what she wants. For the longest time, the adult me has ignored her 'nagging' to do this, too afraid due to discouragement from my parents. It may have become a bad habit to disregard my inner voice and only do what I think others will approve of.

So, I am glad that I am doing what I always wanted to do now, and I finally accept myself a little bit more. That's pretty good considering I used to hate my outer shell. Maybe I have finally met her and love her exactly for who she is now."	mangadrawing123	post	32.510011075430974	female	White	0.003882646793499589	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

"Yesterday while cleaning out my grandparents house i fell off a ladder.  It wasn't super high but it was quite the shock.  I woke up to a splitting headache.  I was wondering if i had a concussion or injury that might be serious but then pretty much laughed it off because... who cares anyway. 

I talk to myself a lot when I'm over there alone,  going through things.  I don't know if i think I'm talking to my deceased family or God or what.  I'll ask why so much is on my shoulders, what am i being punished for.  Maybe in a past life i was a terrible person. I have all sorts of thoughts. 

Today is my mother's birthday.  She would be 66 years old. 

I have been thinking about how an animal feels if it's starving and it waits patiently for someone to throw it scraps. And how even if the person who gives it scraps isn't good to them... they're starving, so they'll eat it. But one day would they be strong enough to refuse the scraps,  because the person isn't kind to them?

And that's how i have always felt amongst people... but especially now.  Emotionally starving. So i take the scraps when they come my way, because I'm starved. And nothing i seen to do for myself has cured that hunger for interaction and love.  At least not yet.  Will i ever be strong enough to resist the scraps thrown my way from time to time. I'm mostly used to the hunger now,  so it doesn't bother me as much anyway. 

The one thing i had to look forward today isn't going to happen... but again,  it was only scraps. But I'm a bit upset, and my head is killing me... and i just want to go home.  But there is so much to handle. And no one else to do it."	mrsheartbroken	post	16.90699083094964	female	White	0.010971066541969776	na	na	na	4	MentalHealthIsland

"Concussions can occur when your brain gets jiggled around inside your skull. This happened to me, and I had a splitting headache for an extended period. Turns out it was a concussion. If you can, it doesn't hurt to get checked out medically. There are things you should and shouldn't do while healing from a concussion.  

Concussions can also trigger a spike in anxiety, and other difficult emotions and even personality changes. .... 

Sorry about feeling so lonely and emotionally disregarded. I totally get it, please keep trying and asking for clinical support for emotional needs is ok too.

"it‚Äôs possible.

It‚Äôs much harder to believe that you can do it. Something that you have never done before and you had always dream of it.

i can become a UX/UI developer.

i. can create an app.

i can learn adobe illustrator and make an animate character like Duolingo. 

I won‚Äôt be blindly believe in it Without a Plan. 

it Will be Slow. 5-10 years ( but i had learned my lesson to take it easy on myself. One smallest step at a time)

I learn to be 1% calmer during the time i frustrated with myself. 

I will be depressed about myself. But i will start to recognize those though now. and start watching youtube video that help me reach my dream.

i will pay for class on Coursera to get me credible ceritifcates.

I will join group on Facebook. 

I will take it One day at a time. 

Not Blaming Myself. Anymore.

I had do my best. No. I had done enough for a day. That‚Äôs my best for today. And i don‚Äôt judge myself that i should have done more. Like my aunt who think i work slow, but she is the one who always stress out and making mistake that need to be fixed at the end.

Slow but steady!

One Firm step at a time! 

I had done a good job today. This is my best! According to Me.

So, I had a very good day today. I spent time with my family, went to an antique and found some cool things, went to go watch Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 (it was amazing). It was really nice day, but I heard something terrible happened that was really far away and out of my control. Now, I feel like I'm not supposed to appreciate today because something sad happened and there are probably others having a bad day. I just want to appreciate today. I like having good days. I know sometimes I will have bad days, but that doesn't mean all my days have to be bad.	Secure_Opening_6852	post	19.31959425222498	male	White	0.0011985928285866976	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

"I felt the signs. I knew It's out of control. I knew I can't handle it.

&#x200B;

Last week.

&#x200B;

Thoughts came to mind. I knew what it was meant. The feelings and the desire. So I went to hospital. I needed help. They gave me injection just temporarily for the night. They offered me to stay if I feel it but after taking med I felt better so I didn't stay the night there but at least I knew I was safe.

&#x200B;

I already had three appointments with this psychiatrist at hospital. She tries to help me, I know but at the same it's exhausting and I feel hopeless.

&#x200B;

I went there 3 times last week and again tomorrow and it's too much for me... asking me questions for hours. I'm was on this road before and it feels horrible to do it again. Feeling hopless

"I'm glad you recognized when things were getting out of control because that alone signifies that you are more in tune with yourself and your emotions. 

That said... yes.  YES...1000x yes.  Mental health treatment is exhausting.  All the questions... then wondering if what you said is exactly what you mean, or how did the therapist take it.  And that's not even the real treatment part of things, just the initial questions.  

But it gets better.  Kind of like learning a new skill or exercising.  At first it's so hard you don't want to do it anymore.  You're no good at it and think what's the point... I'm exhausted and miserable.

But... in time,  slowly, it gets easier.  Bit by bit, your endurance improves.  You aren't as tired.  You see the bigger picture. And later,  you find this is something that is beneficial and you feel better from it and you want to do it. 

But that's a long way down the road.  For right now, try not to get discouraged.  The exhaustion is real.  But it gets better.

Unless your parents emancipate you, you will end up back at home via police or you will end up in the system or you may get ignored all together and you‚Äôll probably end up homeless in California. You haven‚Äôt even begun to think about the cost of living difference between those two states or what will happen once you get there and you have no job and no money. I live here in California. Unless you have some people you can trust to help you get in your feet here, you will not make it. You‚Äôre qualified to work only the lowest wage jobs which will barely afford you low income housing, not to mention food and amenities. Sometimes life teaches you that you can‚Äôt run from your problems and you have to find a way to overcome them, even if it means learning to have tougher skin and to be able to ignore all the negativity that you‚Äôre experiencing. If you do decide to venture off on your own, give it a little more thought than, ‚Äúmaybe I can hitchhike across the USA.‚Äù.. You can‚Äôt. You‚Äôre too young and you‚Äôll end up dead or worse. If you do go through with moving in general, you‚Äôll need to map out exactly where you‚Äôre going to want to live that will give you access to public transportation to get to and from work since you obviously don‚Äôt have a vehicle, and California sadly isn‚Äôt super great when it comes to that. You‚Äôll also probably need to save up two months rent that you can pull out of your bank as cash to help you get set up, otherwise you‚Äôre just going to crash and burn.

"I was recently engaged and to my fiance, whom I love dearly (of course)...and we are meeting my mom. Sigh, where to start...let's just say I'm feeling **incredibly** vulnerable right now. 

First, I'm a CPA who has an aptitude for computer programming, financial analysis, etc...but I'm not a math genius. My fiance *might* have the impression that I'm really smart at math and I do not want to let her down. We are to play the game *Set* tonight with my mom and her husband, and I don't want her to think I'm stupid if I don't win or at least do well. I'm practicing but I don't think I can make myself a math whiz or anything and it's causing a lot of pressure.

Second, we were walking around yesterday talking about music and she mentioned that I wasn't *cool* in the rock-and-roll sense (she admits she is not either). She did say that she wouldn't care about me if I were cool...which really shook me. It was my understanding that cool was one of the attributes that society uses to determine worth (a lot of my time is spent worrying internally about how I measure up to what society deems as a worthwhile and desireable person).

I'm a little out of sorts this morning...basically, I need to value myself on a logical, rational, scientific scale **consistent and measurable**. It infuriates me when people throw platitudes out there that have no scientific proof or rational backing (i.e. ""we are all valuable""). That statement would be completely inconsistent with data from the field (people show partiality towards the better / more attractive / more popular specimens among us). The one thing I am sure of is all things we engage in are transactions and we are all merely trying to maximize our return.

I'm not sure how to deal with this fear that if she finds me less than suitable due to my skills she won't hand the ring back over."	Saab_340_Driver	post	23.526724413074668	male	White	0.9891387820243835	na	na	na	4	MentalHealthIsland

"You want something measurable your fianc√© fell in love and agreed to marry you. The ‚Äúcool‚Äù conversation was an affirmation of her love for you. She‚Äôs going to this to have a good time with YOU. That‚Äôs all there is, that‚Äôs how she‚Äôs chosen to spend her life by having fun with you. Intellect is great but not strong enough to be the sole reason for attraction, there‚Äôs more to you than your intellectual capability. 

Additionally, it‚Äôs a game, meant to be fun, that‚Äôs what she‚Äôs anticipating, having a good time not necessarily seeing you win. Just because you may be perceived as smart doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre infallible and will always win/do well at things. You‚Äôre just a person complicated and flawed and loved dearly by your fianc√© all the same give her and the legitimacy of her love more credit.

"     So hi I‚Äôm fin/Koshca I‚Äôm a normal student just trying to get through the next few weeks till school ends. And I‚Äôm pretty sure I got sick like 2 or 3 weeks ago(I have still been going to school because it hasn‚Äôt really affected me that much). I‚Äôm more then sure I got it from one of the other studentsü•≤.
     To explain what it is I can breath right, I am really cold even tho it‚Äôs really hot outside, most of my body seems to be in pain(except my head and chest), this also makes it hard for me to eat drink or do productive activities. I have drank water tried to exercise and even rest but non of it seems to work. The weirdest part is that I don‚Äôt look or feel like I‚Äôm burning up so I don‚Äôt think I have a fever or cold even tho the symptoms are very similar.
     Yes ik this is a community for mental health issues but that‚Äôs the point in all this. I was finally able to feel like I was on the right track to getting my mental state back on track, but then this came up and made it so hard for me to control me emotions I ended up hitting someone just because they pat my on the shoulder(which is just a normal way to get my attention since I listen to music often to get away from all the noise).

"From the earliest I could remember, I had severe social anxiety. Up until high school, I more or less survived socializing by being independent and a perfectionist. I realized (very belatedly) the perfectionism and my overly serious, practically mute demeanor was just me not letting my guard down 24/7. Afraid of scrutiny. Afraid of letting people know things about me. Afraid of showing incompetence, so I did the best I could by myself. This worked in HS. Not so much in college where I had to adjust to completely new things

But my life plan derailed and then of course, pandemic hit. I‚Äôve been learning to work on my social anxiety, which was a major factor in my plan blowing up in my face. 

It‚Äôs a lot of one step forward and two steps back. Made friends at the start of the pandemic. Discovered we had barely anything in common and lost touch. Made a few more friends. Lost quite a lot of close friends and family, which has affected my ability to trust

Now I‚Äôm trying to negotiate boundaries with myself that I should‚Äôve learned years ago. Straddling the line between allowing myself to be known and allowing vulnerability vs guarded stonewall or inappropriate oversharing. I‚Äôm not exactly where I wanted or want to be, but I‚Äôm still in school, so that‚Äôs something. By next semester, it might even be easier since my university will finally have face to face classes"	iSwearfml	post	24.101222702654322	female	White	0.020672747865319252	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

"It sounds like you've been through a tough time, but I'm glad to hear that you're actively working on your social anxiety and trying to develop boundaries. It's definitely a process and it can be challenging, but the fact that you're making an effort to improve is a huge step forward.

Developing trust can definitely be difficult, especially after losing close friends and family. It might help to focus on building smaller, more gradual connections with people rather than diving into intense friendships right away. It's okay to take things slow and get to know people slowly over time.

Have you considered seeking professional support, such as therapy or counseling, to help with your social anxiety and the process of building trust? It can be a helpful resource to have someone to talk to and work through your thoughts and feelings with.

Overall, keep in mind that it's okay to make mistakes and stumble along the way. Developing trust and vulnerability takes time and practice, so be kind to yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way."	iSwearfml	reply	na	na	na	0.020672747865319252	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
"I'm trying everything I can to support myself and my daughter. Meanwhile, I've been sick as hell (in the ER 7 times in less than a month). I'm waiting to get in with rheumatology and oncology/hematology. They gave me a toradol (non narcotic injection of like super anti-inflamatories) shot and I've had ten days of feeling slightly less shitty (no ER visits!). But I'm walking on eggshells (absolutely terrified) at the possibility of another decline. 

At the same time, my eight year old is readjusting to school, after being on homebound schooling for around five months. She went on homebound after she had a mental health crisis at school, the day before Halloween. 

Last week, we had a meeting with all her teachers and they announced that they thought it was time to roll back some of the special Ed accomodations they had set up for her because she was doing so well. 

I was really excited to hear that she was exceeding their expectations. The next day, I had to pick her up early, because she was highly anxious and reactive.

Y'all, I could scream!!!! We have had seven school days since that meeting and she's had to be picked up early each day for one thing or another. 

Her teacher tells me I shouldn't worry about "" a few bad days"" but I'm so over all of this. I have been on nonstop, active, mom duty since the end of October. I feel so damn selfish, but I'm exhausted. I thought getting her back into school would take some of that weight away, but at this point I'm absolutely hopeless. 

I don't even feel like there's any point sending her to school tomorrow. I don't understand how they can say she's doing all this so well and doesn't need increased support and literally the next day she is in need of additional support (insert surprised Pikachu face)...

I can't even contact the school right now, because I'm so angry, I won't be coherent and I'm not even sure who/ what I'm angry about or at. I'm just overwhelmed. How am I supposed to balance her needs with my needs (that have been ignored to a frightening level) and taking care of our needs. I feel like I'm going to pass out."	eminva02	post	24.905429673465942	female	White	0.9994063377380371	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

"thinking on my couch, the part that made me angry, was the way in which it was all approached.  The authority over me.  The harsh tone.  I wasn't used to that.  I didn't understand it.  Especially as a 30 year old man searching for my meaning and fulfillment in life.  Every instance where I ever had a problem it should have been trying to understand where the other person was coming from.  All I remember is them trying to tell me to shut the fuck up and listen to them.  I mentioned that my brother looked different since I haven't seen him in such a long time oh no!  And that is what I was getting demonized for.  But all I saw is this loud obnoxious ""YOU MUST APOLOGIZE NOW!!!""  I still remember her screaming on the top of her lungs while in the car as they left and abandoned me on the side of the road.  I remember them telling me I must apologize for ""talking behind my girlfriends back a couple of months ago.""  all of those text messages with demands making me feel guilty as if I was some kind of criminal escaping my wrongdoing.  All of the anxiety I had while starting a new job.  I was scared and nervous enough as it is.  Trader Joes seemed like a pretty prestigious place to work for.  On my lunch, I will get another text message from my brother.  At this point, it felt like harassment.  I needed someone who I can trust to talk to that happened to be my mom.  I felt a certain way about your girlfriend.  As far back I can remember 5 years ago on that camping trip.  I saw nothing else other than an authority figure.  A new mom telling me what to do.  Mad at me for not planning the camping trip enough, when I didn't have enough money to begin with being a college student majoring in something stressful like computer science with calculus 2 difficulty level classes.  I always resented your girlfriend, I was just forced to keep it to myself because I didn't want to hurt your feelings."

"My story about how i was manipulated and used as a vulnerable teenager, be careful who you let into your life.

&#x200B;

I am now 16 years old but at the time I was 15, I had just moved to this new school about 6 months before this. I didn't get a lot of attention from boys and I never really had in my life then. This one popular boy though would give me just the right amount of attention. He was not cute in any means he was just a popular kid. We ended up having classes together and became closer over that whole first semester. He would flirt with me and obviously I took it seriously because I had never gotten male attention ever. Well this boy had a bad reputation within certain groups of girls, he was accused of sexual assault etc. I did not know this until after this was all over but it turned out to be true. Basically the flirting escalated and he would try and get me to go places with him after school to do things. I never did. Then at school football games he would try and get me to go behind things and do stuff with him. I also never did. while he was doing all this he would feed me lies and tell me everything I wanted to hear. I was being completely manipulated. At this time we were not anything and he told me he wanted to be with me but was not allowed to. ( turns out this was a complete lie). A couple months go by and he eventually started to ""date"" me, after I told him I wanted to date or nothing. Eventually he would start forcefully kissing me, I would say no and he would force me to. He would constantly ask me for nudes ( I never sent any). He would make sexual comments to me constantly. We ended up breaking up due to him having sex and messing with my best friend ( at the time) while we were together. I ended up figuring out he would lie to his parents about where he was when he would be at my house and they did not know we were dating. we broke up around march of last year.  Then this most recent summer he made a rumor to the football team that I gave him head, which never happened. This rumor really upset me because that tears you down mentally and its not a good feeling knowing people have that idea of you in their head. There is a lot more that went on that I have blocked out from my memory now. After that I began to get more attention from boys and got comments about my body from popular boys that I thought were cute and that they actually liked me but in reality they just wanted in my pants. In September of 2022 I started dating my current boyfriend, I am his first girlfriend and am his first everything mostly as he is mine too. He loves me so much and has never tried to get me to do anything I don't want to. Just anytime anything sexual comes up in conversation I get those feelings back I had when I was being used and manipulated. I start to get worked up and think I'm being used again, When in reality that's not true at all. I just hate feeling this way and it upsets me that I'm still effected today and in my current relationship. Every single sexual thing he says makes my mind immediately go to bad thoughts and ideas that aren't true. I think of his intentions towards me as bad when I know they are not. I never have fully told this to anyone and I don't feel comfortable talking to anyone about it fully."	Riversss111	post	17.272689419534295	male	White	0.9951170682907104	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

"Hi. I've never been on Reddit before, but here I am. 
I need some advice and I can't ask anyone around me.
I'm 21, turning 22 this year. And there is just a lot happening. I was gonna write it all out but thought that maybe I shouldn't and that it wouldnt really add to my point.
I just feel insanely trapped and stuck in my life as I watch it fall apart.
Back in highschool, after some events and realizations, I asked my mom to go to therapy. I thought it would help. She and my dad agreed and I started going to therapy, which ended up being a bit more than I bargained for at first. But I stuck with it. I don't really remember much cause I don't have the best memory, but I opened up about stuff that was happening then. Ive always had a problem telling her what the big problems were cause my biggest fear was ending up in a mental hospital. Still is. She ended up getting me to sign up for the medicine for my mental health. I had a hard time taking meds but I went with it cause I thought I would feel better. 
But after a bit I started having side effects and I stopped taking them. With a big argument that morning with my dad and a bad day at school, I stopped going to therapy and taking meds. 
Years later, after I graduated I believe (which was a trainwreck and one of the worst years). I went back, different therapist since mine had left. She was nice and I opened up more. Finally telling myself I needed help. But I fell off it again. Nothing she said helped, and she often had nothing to say. I still felt trapped and I didn't know what I was missing. Then about just last year I tried it again. Different therapist too. She even tried a different approach but I just couldn't. Every time I promised myself to speak about how I felt and all the issues Ive been having but every time I am in front of them I don't. I can't say anything to anyone. It stops just at the back of my throat and I start a new conversation. I've never been honest about anything that pertains to myself. 
I have a hard time explaining things too cause at the end of the day, I don't know why I'm this way. I have a bunch of symptoms but no explanation to why. They always ask me if I had any traumatic experiences, but I haven't had any. Some days I feel like I'm really bad mentally. But some days I feel like I have nothing to complain about.
I just don't know what else I can do. Or how to even get words out to explain to anyone that I don't know what to do. 
Sorry about the long post.
Anyone have any advice or anything?"	boog-ghostie	post	26.094443420446538	female	White	0.9988238215446472	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

Alot of people feel like this, you are not alone. Our own brain can be our biggest enemy. I do this too. I know there are things I really need to talk to someone about, but when I try to speak it out loud, suddenly my vocal cords dont want to work.  Medication is not for everyone and its not there to cure you, its just a helper to reduce symptoms. I have changed medication so much over the last 13 years. Some worked so well until your body just gets too used to them.  Alot of people fear exactly what you are expressing about telling a therapist everything in your head.

"Most of the time I get away with just pushing this sadness down and getting stuff done but today is triggering and I just want my mum and I just want to hear her voice. 

When I was 6, I was playing outside on the footpath/sidewalk. I was 6. An elderly white gentleman in a fast car tried to scare me by driving into the curb. He told me to get off the path and go somewhere I belong followed by racist slurs. 

I went to mum straight after the incident and none the less (even tho she was intoxicated) she hugged me and told me it was ok. 

This morning a lady on the footpath changed to the other one after I walked on the same one as hers. Living as a 23 year old queer man of colour in a predominantly white city is so traumatising and I just want my mum to confide in.

Maybe you can change your scenery with a nice walk in nature or visit to a lake or beach. Diet can also greatly affect our moods, for example most people are lacking sufficient magnesium and that can contribute to depression. Physical exercise can also improve our mood and self worth. Many people go through the same things and you're not alone, there are people that love you and if they aren't around you currently you can find them and put them in your life. Dealing with stressful situations in life can be similar to exercising a muscle, it's not easy at first but if we accept the challenge and look at it as an opportunity to be stronger in the long run,  we can strengthen our response to it.

"So yesterday I was humiliated in the halls at school over a stupid outfit and with bad depression I want to kill myself over it and I feel like my parents don‚Äôt care I told them that I am not going anywhere and I don‚Äôt care what they say and they‚Äôre just like ‚Äúkids will be kids‚Äù or ‚Äúyou still have to go‚Äù Are you fucking serious?! You want someone who is mentally unstable to deal with worthless students?

"\> halls at school over a stupid outfit

The ""kids will be kids"" part, I have kids myself. They are essentially saying ""ignore them"".

Separately, if you have been threatened, then report it to the right agencies, in the least amount of words and emotions as possible. Get it in writing.

Being picked on in school over clothes is probably one of the most juvenile things that have been happening for decades. You'll be ok, but you have to change your mentality in how you let kids into your control of your emotional state.

tips, in no certain order:

1. This is a concept of be wary of what you put out there, like don't give people bait to egg you into a conversation you don't want to be in. Modify your wardrobe, hit up a thrift shop and don't turn your presence in school into a fashion statement, you have absolutely zero things to prove to any of those booger pickers.
2. If you have suicidal ideations, talk to your doctor, call a helpline, talk to your parents, find a therapist.
3. Your parents are probably doing the best they can and don't know how to help you adapt or how to talk the same language as you but give them a benefit of the doubt that maybe they want too. For example, I grew up in a very different era than what my child has. I can only use my experience to help my child face their problems. The stuff your parents/me went through is ALOT different than what you/my child are going through, with tiktok, and voice changers and this/that, we wont understand each others burdens to the tee, BUT the stuff we went through def probably feels as serious/strong as the stuff you are going through. There's a communication error if you are trying to tell them something and they don't understand it. I assume your parents have experienced school and probably had a social life before you. Try to make peace with your parents because they won't always be there, and when you lose one, you'll never get that time back. I'm not saying this next part to tease you, but you're 16, don't make decisions out of an emotional state, especially one out of rage, anger or depression. Let them talk, and if it doesn't make sense to you, ask them to explain it in a different way.
4. You are 16, you have a lot to live for, and 1-2 years left of this before you can be free of this cycle, but if you don't adjust your mentality now, you'll end up leaving school and having someone else fill in the gap (the gap of letting someone use words get you into a frenzy). Try to fix whatever you feel might be a problem or at least find some peace so you can find some happiness. What you are going through is not permanent. You can have a whole life ahead of you, don't let other people control your emotional state.

&#x200B;

I know it might feel like the right thing to do, but hurting yourself over a tshirt or whatever it is (and no, i dont need to know what it is) and boogerpickers picking on you, it's NOT worth it. Please do not hurt yourself or run away. Talk to your parents and/or ask them to help you find someone you can talk to confidentially, like a therapist or a local religious person you connect with, and no i'm not saying attend church, just general advice, priests or chaplains tend to have a confidential contact with people they speak with."

Ask your parents if you can do online school for a while. You can ask to see a counselor at school and tell them you don't feel safe at school. They could give you a safe place to do your school work.  You should not have be abused.	DrFoxclaw-_-	reply	na	na	na	0.9988620281219482	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
"First, I'm so sorry to hear about how much pain and frustration you're going through. For many of us, high school was one of the worst times in our lives. That's especially true when bullying is involved.

The phrase ""kids will be kids"" is  problematic in several ways. It excuses verbal and physical abuse as normal and expected. It suggests ignoring the damaging behavior will solve the problem. It puts the responsibility for stopping the abuse on the victim.

I don't care if bullying is common. It's not okay, and it's not acceptable.

Outrageous Collar makes some excellent suggestions about getting help. You don't have to suffer in silence, and I'm sorry your parents responded the way they did.

The primary trigger for my depression was my  high school experience. While high school lasts only a few years, the damage carried from it can last a lot longer. 

I've dealt with suicidal ideation throughout my life with depression, even today.  Sometimes it *feels* like it's the only way to get relief. You can and will, however, develop other ways of coping. 

By now, I take medication (prescribed by my psychiatrist), go to therapy and make sure to stay in contact with my friends and family. 

Remember, all of you, you are precious. You are worth it. You are irreplaceable.

P. S.

I called a crisis line (988, a United States mental health crisis line) in January of this year when things got really bad. Sometimes you need to talk to someone *in the moment* that you're most in distress.

My experience with the crisis line was very positive. The counselor was very sympathetic and helped me focus on constructive action so I'd feel better. Most of all, I didn't feel trapped in my own feelings anymore."	DrFoxclaw-_-	reply	na	na	na	0.9988620281219482	strong	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
"I want to start off by staying I don‚Äôt want this post to get political. I‚Äôm just trying to see if there‚Äôs anyone out there that has had similar experiences with guns and their omnipresence.

About 6 months back, I was on my porch of my apartment when I heard a horrible car crash. My unit is on the end, closest to the main road, so I leaned over my porch to see what happened. I see a man walking down the middle of a normally very busy road. So as to not get involved, I turned around to go back inside. That‚Äôs when I heard 5 gunshots go off. I live alone, so I hid in my closest and cried, waiting for the chaos to end. I would later learn that the man I saw in the middle of the road, maybe 15 ft from where I was standing, was the shooter. He terrorized our city, killing and injuring multiple people that night. One of his victims was right outside my window. I heard her daughter scream. 

I‚Äôve never been in a situation where I was that close to a person and a gun that killed somebody. I didn‚Äôt sleep a lot for a week or so after. 

Fast forward to yesterday. I was driving to work and I pull up to the intersection and I‚Äôm about to turn right. I see a man walking through the middle of the intersection, in the middle of the road. I was staring at him, confused. It was 7:30 am and he wasn‚Äôt in the crosswalk so the whole scene was very odd. As I‚Äôm looking at him, he‚Äôs walking in front of my car, and he looks right at me. 

That‚Äôs when I look down, and I see he has a gun in each hand. 

I remember thinking as everything I‚Äôm seeing registers, ‚ÄúIf he wanted to, he could shoot me and I would die.‚Äù That‚Äôs when my whole body starts shaking, I start hysterically crying, and I put my hazards on and try to reverse my car. He was right in front of me!! All I knew is I had to get out of there. I called the cops once I make it a safe distance away. I have no idea what happened to him. 

My work let me stay home as I was very shaken up. The whole day all I could think was, ‚ÄúI must have horrible karma. Why does this keep happening.‚Äù Nobody else in my life has had such close encounters with guns in this way where their life was in danger. I‚Äôm hoping to find people who have been in similar situations and how they coped. 

Because, since the second one has occurred, I‚Äôm struggling. I‚Äôm suspicious of everyone I don‚Äôt know that I see walking down the street. I tense up when I see a car drive up quickly behind me. I‚Äôm overall just genuinely terrified and I don‚Äôt want to live life this way. I don‚Äôt want anyone in my life to know how I‚Äôm feeling because I don‚Äôt think anyone would actually understand."		post	26.989133161323647	male	White	0.8655654788017273	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

"Hello MHI friends, its been awhile since I have popped in here to say hello. I think of you all often. I have been on a different road to wellness. On the week of March 13 my husband and I took a week trip to Colorado Springs in southern Colorado. We stayed in Woodland Park up in the mountains just West of there. On March 15th while at Campus Days at a  college in Woodland Park I enrolled in the college. I am now in college 38 yrs after graduating from high school. I am in Bible College. I will graduate hopefully in 2025. This first year is online but second year I have to move to near campus. It‚Äôs only a 3.5 hour drive south from my house so hubby and I wont be selling our house since our youngest will live here while we are gone and we can come home for long weekends and holiday breaks.   I just started my 6th week and each week I have 8 hours of video lessons. 

I was kind of nervous about my weekly exams because in High school i struggled with a learning disability and my grades were not very good. So far I am only missing 1 or 2 questions due to the sentence structure and my understanding of it. What will I do after graduating? I have no clue. It‚Äôs all paid for with my inheritance from my dad so I could even go on to 3rd year which is more specialized and might go into film and production school, but I don‚Äôt have to decide right now.   Hubby might even go to school too, but thats his decision.  He is watching my lessons with me and getting som first year teachings.

I worry every day that I'll lapse ... my eating habits. And i can't allow that because it means my health will crumble.  I'm afraid of allowing myself one tiny anything that i shouldn't have with my condition because I'm afraid it'll open the floodgates and I'll lose control. 

I've also always feared i will die early,  like my mom.  I'm 45 now and some days i think well...i have two years left....

But you know...i have to take it a day,  sometimes am hour or even minute, at a time.  

I won't dare say how strong you are because in this moment i know it doesn't feel that way.  At all. But... you are a survivor.  And this is scary shit.  But you are not your brother, nor are you your mother, or anyone else.  You are your own soul, with your own choices and your own destiny.

I'm better off alone at the moment. Love terrifies me, and to be vulnerable with someone that I feel myself being emotionally manipulative is terrifying.

"I'm tired. It's been a few days that my suicidal ideations increased over time. All I'm feeling is just pain and I can't take another one. 

I've been thinking about the ways I wanted to finish myself... no one knows what's inside me. I was thinking how it feels to pull out my tooth.. the joy in suffering 

I broke the spoon and tried to scrach my arm but it didn't bring me the satisfaction. I can't convert the pain into joy anymore. I can't stop thinking about blade

I know the truth about my life and I know nothing will change. Each day is just worse than previous one. 

I hate myself. I hate that I'm breathing

I don't feel real. I don't feel that I belong here. 

I'm not sure what I am anymore... the devil...I don't know what happened to me. All I know is that I don't want this anymore. I know I'm not brave enough to do it so I'm just in this world to suffer until it ends by itself.

You are not who believe yourself to be. You are so much greater, so much more precious, than you can see from where you are.

So I'm a 37 year old, mum of 5.. SHM I've not held a job in a long time as my eldest is 14 and as I'm watching my partner evolve and grow as he's now a manager of a shop. I'm very worried where this is going to leave me in the future applying for jobs and sitting for interviews. Am I not going to be a good candidate as I've been out of the workforce a long time and to be honest I've lost my social skills and may be socially awkward as a result. I try to ask my partner questions but he gets frustrated or says I won't understand.

"I can only respond to the first question. You have committed yourself to your family, a 24 hour, seven day a week job. It's nonstop. I couldn't imagine what it takes to do what you do.

You have developed several skills that translate to the workplace. A remote job might be easier to approach if you have concerns about social skills. 

However, trying to work from home can make your tasks much harder to accomplish depending on the type of work. 

Having said that, social skills take time and practice to develop, no matter who you are. You're more competent than you think you are.

"This is a daily struggle for me.

I can't make sense of it - and I have trouble buying into things my therapist tells me - namely that we all have value, that we don't exist purely to advance our species, that there is some special ""inherent worth"" as humans beyond just the purely being an excellent and highly valued member of the species.  Basically, the concept that we can just ""exist"" as anything but being excellent.

My therapist tells me to have faith in self-worth - this I find to be an infuriating statement. Faith is a terrible thing in many respects - it's anti-scientific, anti-rational, anti-logical - anti- all of the notions on which any evaluation must rely upon. 

Just in engaging in **any** social activities in the past week, the following messages came through to me in statements by others, statements in tv shows / movies, podcasts, etc:

* looks are paramount - people care about them and ""rank"" each others value based on them.
* social status is incredibly important - if you are not of sufficient social status you will be considered to be worth less than others.
* it is so important to be attractive to others - those who get praise for being attractive are worth and valued more than those who are not.

These messages cannot exist for no reason - it would be anti-logical, anti-rational...it must serve the species a purpose to value the best among us as it likely makes us ""better"" across the generations through selective breeding, etc. It absolutely must be an important part and mechanism to making better humans (I think we can say we see this at work with any species through evolutionary biology). 

I don't want to be someone who merely takes up space and I don't want to be sub-optimal.

My one requirement is that I absolutely don't just take this on faith - I need some actual proof and when people tell me that such is not required it's shockingly insulting to my intelligence. Every time my therapist tells me ""you have value"", I essentially say ""prove it..."" she never has a response to that."

"\> have faith in self-worth - this I find to be an infuriating statement. Faith is a terrible thing in many respects

Your therapist isn't telling you to be religious, they are saying to trust/believe in yourself.

I'd suggest logging out of social media and cut down on your exposure to whatever outlets you are intaking information from and consider seeking anger management or further therapy sessions.

I say anger management because you responding to therapist/media/etc, you literally challenge it.

You should invest that drive into finding out what your own self worth is. 

If you can't find it, it's probably because you dont have any and should build some."	Saab_340_Driver	reply	na	na	na	0.9990405440330505	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

What you need is something more practical, like an occupational therapist, or teaching yourself how to self regulate by doing Dialectical Behavioural Therapy.

You can still have purpose and value without being optimal. I know there are others more optimal than myself and some less. But you can still have a worth while role in others lives or a purpose you pick, like environment or child well being,  animal rights. I struggle like you cause as get older my usefulness has drastically diminished. No grandkids or good friends, I struggle too. I try to be a person who encourages others who look to  try homesteading as I lived that life for decades. I try to be helpful in any small way I can. But yes I struggle with this too and my logic struggles with what my therapist told me as well. I am a realist, and I fight depression but I fight it with hope I can find some way help somehow in this world.	Saab_340_Driver	reply	na	na	na	0.9990405440330505	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
"Mm, so their arguments seem quite eugenicist to me, my opinion is that your life is as precious as you believe it to be, so I‚Äôm that sense, I agree with the therapist. 

However, your life doesn‚Äôt have to have a net negative value for humanity, every little thing you do to help others, helps humanity as a whole. 

Is humanity worth saving? Probably, if not for just the fact as far as we know we‚Äôre the only sentient beings in the universe. Is sentience relevant/important? Well, maybe not in the grand scheme of things, assuming you proscribe to the idea that we‚Äôre all just a bunch of matter and consciousness is but an emergent property of evolution by natural selection. 

But one consequence of evolution is that we‚Äôre pretty much hard coded to look after our own, ie, other people, and we tend to get subjectively positive feelings from helping others, which solves both your net worth problem (contributing to the well being of other people probably makes your existence a net positive assuming you‚Äôre not a kiddy fiddler), and helping others certainly can bring a sense of purpose, a goal, and a reason to highlight self-care since it improves you and your ability to help others.

Self worth is a hard subject for everyone you not alone why it comes to this all I have to say is to ask the same question to the people around you. That is what really matters is how you live your life rn then what happens when your dead . I just hope one day you will know that and understand you self worth isn‚Äôt based off anything but how you live you life and there is never a wrong route to life	Saab_340_Driver	reply	na	na	na	0.9990405440330505	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
"I started to see the signs again a few days ago. It's not that I'm not paying attention to my situation, it's  just I can't further calm myself when it's out of my control. 

A few days ago when I was taking my pills, I was thinking what if I take 100 of them. I didn't pay attention too much to that because I'm usually like this from time to time. All I knew that I was aware that I'm feeling overwhelmed. Then after passing a few days I started to feel numb. 

So this morning I grabbed the razer blade to cut my shoulders, not because I hated myself, no,  but I wanted to feel something else instead of the pain in my mind, just to feel some relief. I still have regret that I couldn't do it. So I punched the wall to at least release something but after punching two times, I was disappointed that I couldn't do it more because I could punch the wall in past constantly without feeling the pain but now even my body is weak. So all I feel is just weakness, both physically and mentally, and the pain is still inside me. After that I had a sudden imagination of a suicidal ideation but it wasn't dangerous because I knew I have these intentions to feel free of my current pain and not death itself. So as some sort of coping mechanism I used my imaginations to stab my chest to feel some relief inside my mind and some other imaginry suicide scenarios just to help my mind for feeling some freedom. 

Eventually I dropped two tears and I think it helped me a little bit. I took a shower and it didn't help much but at least I'm trying to find a way to feel some peace. All I wish for myself is some peace. I hope I can find it in future"		post	21.526115327264428	male	White	0.9933891296386719	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

"Hey guys and girls and theys and thems! ‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôve just woken up from what may be my most intimate dream I have ever had. 

As some of you may know I‚Äôve lost my mum in the recent past. Ive also had to let go of people that didnt serve me. Im sober from everything at this current moment. 

From time to time I get a dream that makes me sob in real life.. welp I just had one. 

I cant always know for certain if its being guided by any particular thought process. But I know for sure this is where I am right now. 

For the longest time I have blamed my self for the way people have hated me. I forget that in this life you have a particular goal. And I know for certain that mine is to let go of what doesnt serve me any longer (particularly peoples judgements). 

I was on the beach but shortly before I was at school. I said something wrong, and my childhood bullies laughed and all started yelling at me. I went to the beach and shouted ‚ÄúWHY DOES EVERYONE ALWAYS FIND SOMETHING TO HATE ME FOR‚Äù. I screamed that so loud I couldnt hear my self. I could only feel the vibrations ring thru my skin on my arms. This scream wasnt an ordinary scream, it was like I had just shed layers and layers of heavy weight off my chest. 

(Mind you) i visit this beach in my dreams a lot as a safe space. Its my childhood home. 

After I had let out the scream, a red token rolled in front of me. There was no one around me at all. I picked up the token (it was kind of see thru and the size of my palm), and it happened to be a heart. 

I looked behind me and this white, hairless, out of this world dog walked up to me and gave me a cuddle. Then his bigger friend of the same breed? I think these two were my guardian angels or parents from a astral world. 

I cant stop thinking about the correlation this has between the waking world and whats protecting me on the other side. 

If you got this far, thanks for reading. I hope my dream inspired you somehow‚ú®ü•π"	SafeInside6750	post	22.71745196100999	male	White	0.0014292062260210514	na	na	na	4	MentalHealthIsland

"I'm looking for some ideas to help my 10 year old daughter get through her medical trauma. For some background, when she was 4 she had a hernia in her belly button that required surgery. The situation was traumatic for her, and she has been terrified of doctors ever since. Only in the last year has she had the words to describe exactly how this has impacted her. She said she had many people fighting with her to put the sleeping mask on her, and she thought she was being kidnapped because they took her away from me. She has sensory issues, so feeling her belly button afterwards and having it be different was also deeply upsetting to her. 

How this impacts her in the present day is that any time there is a doctor's appointment of any kind, she goes into panic mode. Kicking, screaming, anxiety attacks, hyperventilating. I've tried telling her well in advance to prepare her, and I've tried telling her the day before or day of, and both plans have gone equally poorly.

I've tried getting her therapy to talk about her fears. I've called in ahead of the appointment to find out if she will be due for vaccines, and ask them to walk me through the entire appointment from start to finish, so we could role play at home. I've had them give us options, like saying we don't need to do height or weight or change into a gown. I've called ahead to get a child life specialist to help us out. I've called the hospital ahead of time to remind them that she is anxious and we will need extra time. I've had her school guidance counselor talk to her about it. I've had a heart to heart with her, by reminding her that as my kid I'm responsible for her health and wellbeing, and I'm just trying my best. I've allowed her to skip a vaccine or two along the way just because I can't handle the panic attacks and seeing my kid freak out. It's difficult. She's also 4'11"" so almost as tall as some adults, and I can't carry her in under my arm like I could when she was younger.

Well, doctor appointments are once a year or so, so no big deal, right? Wrong! We learned at her last appointment she has scoliosis so she will need to come in 1-2 times a year for an x-ray to monitor it. Believe it or not, I'm actually so stressed out about the idea of getting her to cooperate without losing her mind, kicking, and screaming, that I haven't even had a chance to worry about the scoliosis. I'm just worried about getting her in the building! 

Am I missing anything? How else can I be helping her? I worry for her future with this much medical anxiety. Someone with this much of a struggle will have a difficult time getting adequate care or seeking out preventative healthcare in the future. I want to be a good mom and I want to help her overcome this. Thanks!"	snibbledibble	post	33.736578777954264	female	White	0.9975842237472534	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

"It sounds like you yourself are quite anxious and understandably so. If you are worried about your child‚Äôs anxiety, your child will pick up on that and believe they shouldn‚Äôt be anxious. Whatever feelings we resist, persist so if we give the child the impression that it‚Äôs wrong to be anxious then she will be subconsciously trying not to be anxious which will perpetuate the anxiety indefinitely! 

Your child needs to learn thats is okay to be anxious, it‚Äôs okay to be afraid. It‚Äôs a natural human emotion and she will NEVER get rid of fear. So instead of trying to fix or remove fear, we have to learn to live with fear. 

Practices like meditation and yoga can help to really feel these feelings without trying to run from them (which causes them to escalate). Meditation helps people to get better at feeling, not to feel better. When you don‚Äôt mind feeling afraid then the anxiety will settle. 

For this I suggest you lead by example with meditation/yoga (perhaps it could be an activity you both share?). If you aren‚Äôt worried about your child‚Äôs worrying then that will show your child that it‚Äôs okay to worry and she‚Äôll stop fighting it and things will settle in time. Also give grace, we all have anxiety and it takes a lot of time for us as humans to truly reconcile with fear.

Also I do want to stress this. Don‚Äôt see anxiety as a problem in your child that needs to be removed. Anxiety is a part of your child that needs to be embraced.

"     Hi I‚Äôm fin/Koshca, I just found out a kid went missing from my school and I could have prevented it. I don‚Äôt feel too bad about it I just and seeking some advice to cope with my anger rn. He went missing the same day I was on the bus with him he sat across from me(this was 4days ago). Quite literally he could have been at school Monday morning not even knowing he dodged a bullet. 
     I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm that much of a bad person anymore because I have been getting better with my emotions. But now that this happened I feel like I should have told the school but I didn‚Äôt because I thought the authorities had it under control up to like 10 kids went missing in my age group and they all went missing in my area. I could have told the police at my school to make an announcement but I didn‚Äôt. I sat back and didn‚Äôt say a word. 
     I feel like this kids life could still be saved but I can‚Äôt find any information about him since he went missing. I‚Äôm not a pro at finding or tracking people down but I have conations. I can‚Äôt believe that I can find him but if I at the very least was able to remember he name it would help a lot because I know he has Snapchat. 
     I have a feeling that someone will find him before he is found dead (I assume this because two of the kids that went missing have been found dead) I just hope for at the very most he is alive rn. Idc if he was a jerk to everyone at my school and was really annoying but i don‚Äôt believe someone should die like this without knowing what is going to happen to them. My beliefs are making me feel more guilty then ever since I could have done something I could have stopped him from getting kidnapped this is something, I just hope one of you can help me overcome these emotions of guilt and anger that I feel. I will cut it short here before I start to say anything personal."	FIN_1937	post	21.099524807808272	female	White	0.9847511053085327	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

"Not in the best place right now.

I was hearing someone singing in opera into my ears... funny.. I even don't like opera. voice of an angel.

I heard imaginary voices in my ears before, but it was the time when I was very sick. I didn't expect to hear another again... and this time someone singing from the heaven... or maybe it was just my insanity.

All I knew that I didn't want to be alive that moment. I wanted the peace. I still keep thinking about harming myself.

"I was exploited by a rich psycho

I got ‚Äúsued‚Äù by some rich psycho

Hi, I‚Äôve told this story to so many people, so many therapists and yet they just think i‚Äôm overthinking and need to be put in a psych ward. The thing is I‚Äôm not overthinking. Basically when I was in high school, I used to hang with this super rich girl who was fake asf. I remember her making comments like ‚Äúbitches wish they were me‚Äù or ‚Äúbitches be dumb‚Äù and ‚ÄúI be ending bitches‚Äù she would refer to her male partners as ‚Äúassets‚Äù so basically she would set vulnerable girls up with her male partners love bombing the girls and and then those men who were referred to as ‚Äúassets‚Äù would steal financial resources from the girls family. She would also misinterpreted my identity by callling be a ‚ÄúPalestinian‚Äù because i don‚Äôt from from great wealth as she does. She would always make comments like ‚ÄúPalestinians are oppressed‚Äù and ‚ÄúMuslims are oppressed‚Äù basically saying that people of my background are inferior and are not worthy of wealth. This is just a heinous thing to do to someone. So basically when I was 15 i gave this girl an unintentional back massage and she got really mad and yelled at me (she was 17/18 at the time) i got really scared and teary and i said I‚Äôm sorry and apologized. in return she stole my financial resources. When I was 18 she set me up with a man that was 10 years older than me who was super disrespectful to me and abusive to me.  According to my instincts this man preys on girls who come from working class families, stalks where their dad works buys out companies and coerces girls to have sex with him. My dad got laid off in October 2019 and he slid in my DMs again acting nice. I would be deleting this man off my social media and he would add me back right away. I was coerced into performing oral sex on him multiple times. Last time i met him, he reclined my seat and said ""i have an idea"" he got on top of me and thrusted his penis so hard that it was hard for me to breathe and i choked. I felt violated. I had my hands on his hips he said ""grab my ass"" i did t feel comfortable and a dropped my hands from his hips to the side of the my seat. He ejaculated in my mouth and then said ""f**k"" with a malicious grin on his face and then he's like ""where do you f**k other guys?"" and then i try not to say anything and his like ""hmm?"" and i said ""at their place"" and then he leaves me in the middle of the street. I felt violated and humiliated. Not only he did that but he bought out the company my dad worked at and got my dad laid off so we can't afford rent and we can move out of our house so his rich girlfriend can rent my house. I just get so angry at this incident‚Ä¶ this feels so unjust and i‚Äôm angry I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. Like what do i do? Where do I go ? who‚Äôs going to believe me??? Basically this rich psycho capitalist ‚Äúfriend‚Äù i had ‚Äúsued‚Äù me, because he was in a relationship with her and liked her so he bought out my dads company basically stole my dads salary and gave it to her‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just disgusting how entitled and oppressive rich people can be and it makes me sad and angry‚Ä¶ like anyone cares‚Ä¶"		post	21.473768272594654	male	White	0.9917762279510498	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

"Hello, 

I struggle deeply with anxiety. For the past year a lot of it has stemmed from food and body image. While I have not been diagnosed with an eating disorder by any means, I feel like I am mentally struggling with food. I counted calories strictly for months and lost some covid weight (about 40 lbs). I remember when I was younger I managed my weight decently by eating when I was hungry and stopping when I was full. Now I eat when it‚Äôs time to eat and stop when I‚Äôm done with the pre portioned calories in my plate. This has effected my ability to go out to eat with people and it takes up a lot of my thoughts. I have been trying to be easier on myself and I gained about 2 lbs. I feel horrible about it. I have a trip coming up next week and I‚Äôm scared I won‚Äôt even be able to enjoy it because of all the numbers in my head. I really just want to be normal again and stop obsessing. I‚Äôm constantly looking at nutrition labels. I need to know the macros and calories. I use my Apple Watch to count how many calories I burn. And while I know these things aren‚Äôt accurate, I can‚Äôt turn it off. I really want to eat intuitively but it just doesn‚Äôt feel natural and I don‚Äôt want to put the weight back on.

"It takes a lot of courage to speak out and ask for help. It sounds like you are really struggling with the current diet and number crunching. I wonder what would happen if you gave yourself permission to enjoy the vacation without number crunching. What would happen if you were able to make healthy food choices without the strict regiment? 

For me I think about everything I put in my body and think about the benefits versus taste, overtime my taste acquires as I take notice of the overall benefits in my body. I eat until I‚Äôm at 80% full and always drink multiple glasses of water or herbal tea. Choosing fresh organic fruits and vegetables and staying away from anything processed has been the best ‚Äúdiet‚Äù ever for me. Now I find myself craving water and fruit instead of soda and sweets.

Heyo! Survivor of three attempts  here. The first paralyzed the left half of my body, and being physically  disabled motivated the other two. I'm writing a novel wherein the  protagonist experiences similar things. I have two options I'm  considering:

1. Show  the attempt. I have no memory of my first; I guess my brain was in  ""crisis mode""  dealing with the damage. In the story, the attempt would  fail, but cause a later stroke that would half-paralyze the MC. I can  see portraying the attempt maybe helping some people feel ""seen,"" but I  worry it would give somebody an idea how to do it and/or, if I wrote it  really true-to-life, how to motivate oneself to go through with it.  Narrating the stroke could also be educational.
2. Make  the attempt happen ""off-screen."" I feel like this could be  underwhelming, but it might be safer. I'm also unsure whether I should  mention what the method was.
3. Regardless, this wouldn't be the climax of the story. What do you  think I should do?"	satyestru	post	18.652441848344747	female	White	0.9374602437019348	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

First off, Im so happy you are here today. Tell your story in the most genuine way you are comfortable with. I personally like alot of detail and seeing something like that from the main character's POV is important. I actually know a young man who jumped off a building and all the details of what happened. I told him he should write about his experience. If someone is feeling suicidal, thats not because of what you wrote, the idea was already there. You just put a disclaimer in the beginning. Have you learned from your attempts? Are you ok now?	satyestru	reply	na	na	na	0.9374602437019348	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

"I've been thinking a lot about family, and my history of what that means and how, in the end, I actually have little concept of it.   


My grandparents took me in because my mom was mentally ill and a drug user. My dad wanted no part of me, and I didn't meet him until I was 22. He was married to someone else when I was conceived (or about to be married). I was an unintended child.   


I am thankful for my grandparents and all they did for me, and the love they gave me, but there were a lot of things that happened in my youth that made me feel like I was a burden, and I took away what should have been their child-free years.   


When I was 11, my mother got out of the mental hospital she was in for 2 years and came back with a girlfriend. At first, she ignored me completely and only spent time with the girlfriend, but in time, we all did things together-me, mom, her girlfriend, and her girlfriend's children. It was more like a family than anything I'd known up to that point. I got to actually be in the world around me--go to restaurants, watch cable television--I finally didn't feel like an outsider to my peers.   


Their relationship ended; Mom stopped taking her meds. All of the gifts her girlfriend got for me when I visited their home were taken away when I went back to the house the last time. That hurt. The birds that they kept had been left behind and were all dead. That destroyed me.   


I fell into depression and eventually got a boyfriend who I couldn't stand, but was desperate to regain the feeling of being part of something. I was with him 4 years too long, then ended up meeting the man I married-which was also a mistake, and he left me after 11 years.   


By the time my husband left, I had been talking with my biological father. We weren't close but it was good at the time. He lived a state away, but his mother, my grandmother, lived in town. I'd never met her, and met her in 2007.   


Later that summer she broke her hip, and neither her son nor her daughter (my aunt) came to see her. I went to see her every day, did her laundry, signed paperwork, got her sorted into rehabilitation.   


Later, my father's sister finally came to see her mother and take her back to their town so that she could live with her family. I met my cousins for the first time. They didn't know I existed and were shocked that their uncle had a child. I felt humiliated.   


When my father's mother died a year later, I wasn't included in the obituary. I didn't exist, again.   


When the property was divided amongst the relatives, I was contacted as a ""family contact"" to assist with locating the property...but not as an heir. Again, I didn't exist. 

In 2012 I started a relationship with  my most current ex, and we were together 10 years. I loved him, and his family welcomed me.  I finally had acceptance. Love. They called me daughter. We had meals and celebrations together.  They were my fairy tale--my Cinderella story. I finally had a family.  


Sure, I always knew that I was not actually their child--little things were said here or there to make me understand my place, and I often felt tolerated instead of loved. But it was better than nothing, especially after my grandmother, my last close family member and true parental figure, died.   


But last August, my partner left and with him, I lost the last bit of family I had come to love.   


I am struggling with this. I am struggling with the knowledge that I have been discarded time and time again. I am struggling to make peace with the knowledge that there is no one for me to go to for help or in times of need. I am struggling to understand where I fit into the world around me without anyone at all.   


My therapist tries to remind me that it's not my fault-that it isn't me, it's them, etc. But I can't internalize it any differently. Entire families that just...negate my existence. Over and over again. A dirty secret swept under the rug.   


I have tried so hard. I swear I tried so hard to show I was good enough to be loved.   


I can't try anymore. I am tired."	mrsheartbroken	post	29.948183441417093	female	White	0.015249824151396751	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

You always did the best you could with the circumstances given. You're worthy of more than love. Understanding our past helps reconcile our futures. Making better decisions is part of understanding.

"We are like a crystal. We have many faces.

We form relationships by exposing certain faces to certain people. This is the self we present to others. This faces combine to form our whole self, much like the facets of a crystal form the crystal.

The whole self, much like the whole crystal, is composed of many faces. 

There are few people we connect with perfectly. Such connections are often with family or loved ones. We are accepted for our many faces. Other relationships only require one or a few faces. We need not expose our whole self to form a relationship. However, a relationship where one can be totally transparent, honest, exposing ones whole self, and still be accepted, is unconditional love."

"I know this post is massive, but its extremely important to me, so i'd appreciate if you could take the time out of your day to read it and offer some advice. Thank you, i really appreciate it :)

Marked as NSFW for a briefly detailed mention of SH.

So, my girlfriend and I are long-distance and we've decided we're gonna get our lives together, go through college etc. and then move to the same country eventually to be with each other. Currently we're both nearing the end of highschool, both in grade 11 but she's slowly revealed to me over many months of talking all her mental health struggles.

She gained addictions to substances and vaping from peer pressure but she said with my help she's mostly conquered those, though she still has withdrawal symptoms. She told me once she cried a lot about how she worried she had damaged herself too much to live a long life with me which honestly broke my heart, I can't stand seeing her miserable like that.

She has ADHD and an addictive personality, she accidentally overdosed on ritalin at a young age and her parents took it away from her, and her ADHD i personally believe is the cause for a majority of what im about to say.

She used to scratch at scabs and rip them open often as a habit, and eventually that turned to self-harm and eventually it grew to be self-harm as a comfort or stress-relief and then once someone found out once and told her it wasn't good, her mind shifted. She says she get's terrible withdrawal from it and craves seeing her own blood, because she likes putting bandages over it. I told her when she feels that way to put a bandage on without hurting herself and to contact me immediately which has worked pretty well so far, but there are of course rare times where im unavailable due to irl issues and during those times it doesn't work quite so well. She lives in south-africa and they have these times that she calls a ""lights-out"" period where the wifi, power and data goes out for about 2 hours, usually during the early nighttime. She stays up late usually, and as im sure most people have experienced, the greatest thoughts don't always come during the nighttime. So there have been many occasions where the lights were out and she was unable to reach me and ended up hurting herself. She mentioned during those times she feels a really strong urge to do it and she gets this recurring image in her head of a thing she calls ""Li"" and she says it tempts her to hurt herself and then taunts her forever if she doesn't do it. She said she even feels like she's beint physically watched during those moments and that she can almost feel a presence of some sort. I've fought this feeling off a few times by distracting her with music and affectionate and engaging conversation but i need to help teach her how to distract herself when i can't be there.

Beyond that, she's an extreme perfectionist and is constantly overworking herself and worrying herself to the point of exhuastion during school. She becomes noticably miserable and anti-social and extremely depressive and if she does even slightly worse than usual on anything, she beats herself up over it. I have tried sitting down with her and talking in depth in a calm and loving manner about how she needs to practice being less hard on herself. She genuinely does not understand the concept of not setting impossible standards, she thinks if you don't beat yourself up over failure, that you'll never succeed. This causes major issues because it sends her into a depressive mood which makes her preform worse creating a viscious cycle, and these negative feelings cause her self harm to become more frequent or severe. notable examples being, she onces mutilated the side of her inner hand with scissors, got broken glass and sliced up her legs and once cut pieces of flesh off herself with nail clippers.

We're making slow but real progress on combatting some of that stuff, and i've made sure to never ever show signs of disappointment or upsetness when she hurts herself, i always tell her im proud of her and that she's still getting better because the incidents are becoming less frequent. it's not gonna go away immediately after all, its a long process. but the thing that's really worrying me is that she has moments during her really bad days where she becomes anti-social and wants to isolate, and during those times she told me she has frequent thoughts of suicidal ideation, and if she's alone she gets the urge to do ""really bad things"" she's always vague about that part. Just today she had a miserable day and she said she stopped at a hill on the way home from school and she looked at the edge of it. She said two parts of her fought each other, and she was tempted to hurt herself badly but she decided against it.

My worry is, if i don't heal her faster, what if that self control fails one day? what do i do? I love this girl so much, she's my baby and she's genuinely the perfect girl for me and i want her to just be happy. She wants to marry me, she says it all the time and she's always so loving and affectionate and clingy, i adore her so much. I just want to heal her and make her happy, that's my only goal anymore. but what if i can't? being so limited in my abilities and being the ONLY one to help her, i feel as though i may fail.

As a final note, i have encouraged her to go to her parents but she insists she'll get disowned, she says her friends and almost everyone where she lives bully people with mental health struggles because they dont believe in it and i know she's too stubborn to get professional help, at least until she moves to a different country first. So any advice i would appreciate it if it was something me or her could put into use ourselves. Thank you, I love you guys. <3"	MagmaticDemon	post	21.312741916838263	female	White	0.0013400050811469555	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthIsland

"It's incredibly hard, especially if self medicating (with alcohol) has been a primary coping mechanism. It also doesn't mix well with a lot of psychotropic medications (medications taken to treat mental illness). 

You're still learning different coping strategies, still working on putting together and utilizing new skills.

When our life stressors and/or symptoms worsen, it's very common to fall back into our old habits. They ""worked"" for us before, just at a substantial cost.

I can't tell you anything you don't already know. You can still reach out to your medical provider and level with them.

"First of all, I (F,23) live with my parents and two siblings. Unfortunately I do not work (related to some family issues) and have so little money.

(It's a bit long so u don't have to read all of it but please read last paragraph at least.)

I and my mom have arguments time to time and I'm confident that I can express my feelings/thoughts/needs etc. And sometimes I have breakdowns when I feel it is impossible for them to understand me no matter how hard I try or use plain sentences. It feels like I'm all alone and nobody will ever understand me and my pain will be lasting. Anyhow, nobody seen my breakdown ever. Usually when I feel like that I go to somewhere I can be alone then cry a lot, scream and I do harm myself.

This morning we had a fight, I don't want to share unnecessary details and bore you guys. But my mom said ""you don't even know how to explain yourself"" with a humiliating and tired face... That was my breakpoint then I couldn't control myself and start pulling my hair and scratching my face with my nails. It's not something I think and do, it just... Happens... In those kinda situations I don't even realise what I do till I went calm. My mom saw me in that difficult situation but she didn't move a finger and said ""stop having a crisis"". That was my cue to get out, I took my bag and now I'm I'm in streets with no idea to what to do.

Now my question is, we do have a second house in our hometown. I thought that I can go there but most of our relatives are living there. And I don't want them to interfere with anything. And since I dont have much money  I can't rent a room... Should I talk to some of my friends whose live in different towns and go their house?"	5now_rabbit	post	19.223865272416003	female	White	0.010038191452622414	na	na	na	5	MentalHealthIsland

Family can be difficult and it sucks when they don't understand you. Wherever you are be sure to stay safe. If you have a second house it sounds like a good idea to be there. You can let your relatives know that you are out for a small getaway or vacation. Your friends live in a different town and if you decide to go there make sure you'll have enough money for the travel and other things.

You should reevaluate the job situation and try to move on to your own life, and find a therapist to work out the situations where you blackout and start hurting yourself.	5now_rabbit	reply	na	na	na	0.010038191452622414	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
"I think that if there's any way you would be able to find a small job, it would do wonders for your feelings of self efficacy.  And then, you can make plans to move forward with your life, making time for your family only when and if it suits you. 

It's hard knowing how to take that first step.  But saving some money by doing some sort of work may give you the self confidence you need to do more.  Baby steps."	5now_rabbit	reply	na	na	na	0.010038191452622414	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
I‚Äôm sorry to hear your having issues with your mom and it‚Äôs horrible that she said that to you but went my mother and I were kicked out of our own home we couldn‚Äôt stay at her friends houses I think it may be best if you reach out to other family but I can understand that you don‚Äôt want them to know or get involved in your situation but if your friends are the only other people you can go to go to them and if you have to go back there you might have to get authorities involved Ik that might sound harsh but you should be selfish when it comes to your health mentally and physically it sounds like both are a risk of collapse![img](emote|t5_70gnl4|25762)![img](emote|t5_70gnl4|25460) (and I also think you should get a better job at some point it would help I‚Äôm sure of it)	5now_rabbit	reply	na	na	na	0.010038191452622414	strong	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

I'm so sorry this is happening to you. I experienced emotional violence and I know how that makes you feel. My best suggestion here it's to start making some boundaries. You don't have to make anything big if you don't feel ready right now for that. But you could just tell them that if they talk to you like that you will leave the conversation. If saying it it's not safe for you, you can just leave the room. If they follow enter into a safe room. I really hope this helps. You're not alone with this pain and your experience.

"My brain is not on 100%. I've got something going on in the ADHD/bipolar/anxiety/depression/autism world. Yeah, I know that's a broad range but it all seems fitting in different ways. 

So I've been to my GP, to a psychiatrist, to a psychologist, to a variety of therapists. All of them want to talk a tiny little bit about anxiety and depression, then toss some beginner depression pills at me. Y'all, I've been on the same dang pills for a decade with very little change and no one has done a dang thing to actually look into my brain and the way I function at all. I specifically state that I'm here to figure things out with a diagnosis and we just dabble in the shallow side of trying to get by in today's world. 

Who is the best kind of doc to go to and what do I need to say so we can actually dig in, do some hard work, and get things actually addressed? I don't need someone to just say, ""you need to have self confidence."" I need someone to realize that I've been insulted and left out and ignored and minimized my whole life because I'm different and I'm depressed because no one will acknowledge me long enough long enough to freaking help! 

Don't worry, my husband and I have been able to dig me out of the deepest fall ourselves and I'm really excited to better myself. But I just had the biggest crash ever and have not been stable enough to work for about six months. I need to make some big life changes and I'm just not really able to do that when I can't trust that I'm making wise choices and not fear based choices. Did my career fail because I followed what I was told to do and landed in the wrong field, or am I running from other problems?

Help me figure out who I need to find for help!

"I had a similar experience with with trying to get a diagnosis for ADHD. After struggling in highschool, and eventually getting extreme burnout, I started suspecting that I had ADHD or ASD. I asked my mother if I could get an ADHD assessment done and because neither of us knew what to do she ended up just putting me in therapy. The therapist I saw eventually recommended a psychiatrist, but she was no help at all. My first season I mentioned that I suspected I had ADHD or ASD and wanted to get an assessment done, but she completely brushed me off, ignoring what I wanted entirely. I had no good experiences with her and she wasted a ton of my time and money. Finally we called a place and specifically asked for an assessment. My therapist at the time helped us get in contact with a psychologist who finally (after an initial session where me met) gave me an assessment and diagnosed me with ADHD. Getting good mental health care can be extremely frustrating, especially if you are trying to get a diagnosis. The best advice I have is to call into the mental health centers/offices near you and specifically ask about getting an assessment. It would be best if you narrow down wich one you are specifically wondering about because they will want to know your reasoning for why you want an assessment. When they do assessments for a specific thing it also covers everything else because they have to rule out other possibilities. 

Tldr: You could try calling different locations and asking if you can schedule an ASD/ADHD/depression/whatever. If you do get one scheduled be prepared to give reasonings as to why you want the assessment because they will ask.

Please take all of what I said with a grain of salt as I am barely an adult and got my assessment almost completely out of luck. I really hope you find any of this remotely helpful! Best of luck to you! ‚ù§Ô∏è"	terminator_chic	reply	na	na	na	0.9971502423286438	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
"Or maybe its just the people I have been around.  But for a good majority of people, you know I try to be friendly and sociable but they end up not being a quality friend.  I have a hard time trusting certain people.  For example, a coworker complained that I didn't say hi and I wonder why that concerns him/her in the first place.  I also believe that if someone doesn't understand you or know who you are, they can be very toxic.  

It goes like this, someone wants attention from me, I acknowledge them, I end up disliking them for whatever reason and realize that they mostly only give a shit about themselves.

"Hello,

I have experienced limerence about 7 or 8 times. The most recent one ending in a Panic attack. 

This week

I added this beautiful Italian girl off of Tic Tock and we hit it off. I was unhappy in my two year relationship and after talking with this girl I ended things. I was open and almost was telling my whole life to this girl. She was kind and responded, we talked about cultural differences about her living in my country for a year. We kept talking and we called on the phone a few times. 

After this, things went downhill. I couldn't get her out of my head and started having extreme anxiety when she didn't respond to my messages. Eventually we stopped talking as much and I got worse and worse. I texted her on my morning shift that I had a crush on her. This was only after a month of talking. She said she didn't. I told her I was fine and that we could stay friends. Then two days later I called out of work because my anxiety was through the roof. In the afternoon I started breaking down. I watched videos saying ""Be a man and reject the friendzone"" so in my mental state I texted her like four paragraphs saying how I couldn't be friends and I wanted to take her on a date. Then I freaked out, laying in my bed feeling like my insides were tearing apart and my muscles spasming as I was having a full on panic attack. I sent her a desperate voice message saying how I was sorry I ruined the friendship and I was too attached. Took a nap thinking she would probably block me and she sent a voice message saying how she just wanted to enjoy her time her, she didn't hate me, it was somewhat her fault and that whatever happens happens. I responded with another voice messages saying im sorry again or along those lines. Haven't texted her since. I really wanted to be friends with this girl witch sucks the most. 

Next day I leave work to go to urgent care to see if my thyroid is fucked up (its not)

Tomorrow im going to try and see if I can get a therapist finally

Something similar happened about three years ago causing me to call 211 and being stuck in a depressive state for almost a year. 

How can I prevent this and not resort to the nuclear option every time because this has happened every time I get like that, please help. I hope I can get connected with a therapist tomorrow."	ThrowRA132435453	post	27.559890427856672	male	White	0.9984788298606873	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

"Let me be clear, I am NOT going to unalive myself.

I don‚Äôt think I have feelings, like at all. Not that I don‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel them‚Äù, but that I really don‚Äôt have any. I‚Äôve been so constantly forced to mask my whole life, that I‚Äôm not sure if what I show to people is me actually feeling something, or if it is just a repetition of how I have seen others act. I genuinely don‚Äôt think I have feelings, or maybe emotions is a better way to put it. Like I don‚Äôt get happy, sad, hurt, emotional the way others do. I don‚Äôt feel love, I don‚Äôt love anyone. My love is more of an earned obsession. I mimic all of these feelings, but then if I think about it for even a brief second I realize that I‚Äôm not actually feeling those things. The only feeling I have ever been certain of is the feeling of not wanting to be alive. I know that sounds drastic, and maybe it just sounds like I‚Äôm depressed or numb. But I‚Äôm not, like I‚Äôm not sad about anything. Nothing hurts, I don‚Äôt feel broken. I just don‚Äôt want to be alive, and that seems normal to me even though I know it isn‚Äôt to everyone else.

Also, when I am exhausted. It is like an actual physical bodily reaction, my eyes are heavy, my body is heavy, it‚Äôs like I haven‚Äôt slept in months even though I have. But I‚Äôm not doing anything exhausting, I have an easy job, I have an easy life, nothing is wrong. But my body is tired. It‚Äôs like the past 26 years are a literal weight in my body, that is so hard to carry that my brain has just decided this is enough. It‚Äôs enough life, it‚Äôs enough of this world. I want to know what is on the ‚Äúother side‚Äù of life. What happens when I die, what happens if I just stop existing. My body is retracing my old steps of depression, I can‚Äôt shower; or brush my teeth. I can‚Äôt eat normally, I can‚Äôt take care of myself anymore.

But I don‚Äôt feel depressed, I don‚Äôt feel like anything is actually wrong. My body just won‚Äôt do the things it needs to. I know it all sounds dumb, and maybe it makes no sense. But this is the world I‚Äôm living in, and it is not enough. I have never wanted to die, even when I was suicidal. I just wanted to be okay, I wanted to feel better. But now, it isn‚Äôt like that. I just want to move on from this life. But I can‚Äôt just hurt all of these people who care about me, and who I have led to believe I care about them. I feel like an accidentally manipulative person. I‚Äôm not trying to lie to these people, I just don‚Äôt feel the ways that I should. Because I don‚Äôt have any of those feelings.

"I was diagnosed with Bi Polar many moons ago and was put on Lamotrigine and Duloxetine for the depression.  My brother got me a trial for audible so I could listen to audiobooks at work and I've been trying to find a book on the disorder to listen to.  The main problem is, everytime I read a description on a book, it talks heavily on manic episodes and the awful lows, however I don't have manic episodes ever.  I'm aaalways low...mentally, emotionally and physically (this is the hardest part) - Is it possible I was misdiagnosed forever ago or is it my depression overpowering my bi polar? I have an addictive personality and I want to better understand my impulses based on my diagnosis, as well as any other nuggets of perspective I can get about why I do/think certain things that I do.

Only a therapist can diagnose you. The tricky part is that a lot of mental disorders seem to overlap each other. If you feel that you have something else, definitely reach out and get a second opinion.	TellahC	reply	na	na	na	0.992766261100769	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
"(I made a post not too long ago and all it's talking about is how I am able to welcome myself and love myself more than I have ever in my life)

So. . . I'm not hating myself as much! But I have this thing where I make a mistake and get pissed off over it. It's kinda funny you know? I'm the type of person to preach to my friends about ""Hey, it's okay to make mistakes"" or ""A mistake is a lesson learned"" 

I'm still embracing and trying to love my appearance every day! Such a work in progress you know?

I feel like now since I'm on the path of self love and acceptance I should also work on being easier on myself, people are bound to make mistakes. . . It's just human. I need to work on realizing the fact that I'm not going to do things correctly for the first time. Aiming to be a perfectionist just led me into being in the same spot for years. 

I'm not going backwards, I only want to go forward from here. No matter what it takes I won't let myself down because I can't. It's not in me to do so.

Remember: It takes time to love yourself it's not an easy journey, you don't need to aim for something you aren't. You don't need ANY validation of the sort from other people. Don't care about what anyone else thinks because they can be whiny little piss babies that have no life and it makes them feel good to trash on yours. Be strong, it's okay to be vulnerable. You are courageous and can do anything you need, okay?"	CringeKINGGABEGABE	post	24.259255659883845	female	White	0.005125041585415602	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

This is just the worst way to start a day. It's like it's easier for my brain to think like this without my permission. I'm not sure if I explained it well or not.

Until one can develop new strategies that consistently work for them to alleviate their symptoms, it's likely they'll fall back on maladaptive behaviors for relief.

"Hey, guys! It‚Äôs been a while.

So, bit of an update on the personal front. I am and always have been a person who approaches things logically. That usually has led people to believe that I‚Äôm impervious to emotional distress (so genius, am I right? *eye roll*).

While I, obviously, do have the ability to emotionally react to things, as we all do, I see that the list of things (read: people) that can bring out that reaction has grown shorter. That makes me happy and I wanted to share that with you all. 

It‚Äôs also a step in the right direction for me to combat my own internalized misogyny. I‚Äôm so happy that I‚Äôm able to recognize that now.

I don't mean I have a song stuck in my head, I mean I literally hear external music, like with my ears and not my mind. Over the past year I have been waking up and hearing music, various songs, sounding like it is playing in the room with me or somewhere in my apartment. I would ask my spouse where it was coming from but he said there wasn't any music playing. After about an hour it would go away. I eventually stopped asking him about it and have just kinda accepted it for now. Has anyone else had this kind of experience?	woh3	post	30.610544315888667	female	White	0.9965614676475525	na	na	na	9	MentalHealthIsland

"I called it ghost music. Others might call it auditory hallucinations...

I would hear music playing and would try to locate the source. The closer I got to it, the lower it played. I always heard it at the level where if there were words you could hear them but not enough to make them out. 

The reason I called it ghost music and not auditory hallucinations is because one time I heard it in a room at my dad's house. It seemed to be coming from the ceiling. I asked about it and he at first said he didn't hear it (then). He asked what song it was and I tried to explain it but I wasn't very good at mimicking the sound. Getting a bit frustrated, I said ""it sounds like it's coming out of one of those old music players with a horn thing, but it sounds like a warped record."" (Gramophone)

He immediately knew what I was talking about and had heard it before too. Same room, same spot. I think he assumed it was just in his head at the time too.  Realizing we both heard it years apart was odd and was kinda like *play x files music* moment and we just shrugged it off. 

So, ghost music imo. üòÇ"	woh3	reply	na	na	na	0.9965614676475525	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
Do you happen to live in a very noisy environment? What I mean is you are used to hearing certain sounds daily repeatedly. An example of that is; my dad's bedroom is under mine, so I can hear his TV because the man is deaf as hell lol.  Then on my way to work I listen to my music loudly just because, I jam in my car lol. However, my dad was in the hospital a few weeks back for like 2 weeks and so the constant sound of his TV wasnt there. He watches NCIS on repeat. Even though he wasnt in the house, I kept swearing I hear the NCIS them song. I had to keep checking his room so I didnt feel crazy. It is your brain's sensory nerves or something to the affect. You are more hyper aware to noise than you think and your brain doesnt like to be still.

"Hi, I want to share about a specific matter here.  I was molested when I was eight year old. The molester was 16 year old back then. I did not share about it to anyone for almost 22 years old. Recently I talked about it to my mom, dad, husband and my elder brother. 

The matter is that I fantasized to kill him frequently. From the momen i understand what he did to me, i wanted to kill him slowly. I do not do any harm to that person though. 

My question is that is thinking about killing a molester or rapist frequently is a sign of mental illness? Whenever I read something about it or get to know through social media, i want to kill that person wholeheartedly. I made plan on how to kill them. 


Not to mention, i consulted with a psychologist. She is an wonderful person I have ever met. But she could not help much about it. What to do?"	Bati_18	post	28.02491371496256	female	White	0.005415584426373243	na	na	na	9	MentalHealthIsland

"I think your response to your trauma is understandable. You were damaged and helpless, whatever the circumstances were. 

At this stage, consistent work with a therapist is really important. If you can find someone who specializes in treatment victims of SA, that would be even better.

 A survivor support group for those who were sexually assaulted could really help, too."	Bati_18	reply	na	na	na	0.005415584426373243	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
"Wanting to kill someone in this instance is pretty normal and so is fantasizing about it.

But you experiencing the emotions and feelings of wanting to kill your abuser is part of your abuse that you need to eventually let go of.

My understanding is that with all traumatic things, if you think about it over and over again, you‚Äôre running the risk of increased rumination, which can lead to mental health issues.

I‚Äôd suggest you give meditation a try for a couple weeks. It can work wonders in situations like this and can help you learn to note the existence of those thoughts and allow them to dissipate. The more you practice, the easier it becomes until you realize you just don‚Äôt care about that person anymore. And then you can move on with your life. Until then, you‚Äôre trapped.

This meditation can be practiced for 10 minutes a day or as often as needed. With practice, it can help you release attachment to repetitive negative thought patterns and find a sense of inner peace and clarity.

1. Begin by finding a comfortable position where you can sit undisturbed for the duration of the meditation. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth.

2. Visualize a clear blue sky. Allow yourself to fully immerse in the image of the vast, expansive sky. As thoughts arise, acknowledge them but do not engage with them. Simply observe them and let them drift away like clouds passing through the sky.

3. Bring your attention to your body. Start at the top of your head and slowly scan down your body. As you scan, notice any areas of tension or discomfort. Breathe into those areas, allowing the tension to release with each exhale.

4. Focus on the sensations of your breath. As you inhale, feel the coolness of the air entering your nostrils. As you exhale, feel the warmth of your breath leaving your body. Continue to focus on your breath, noticing each inhalation and exhalation.

5. As thoughts arise, observe them and let them pass. Do not engage with them or allow them to take over your mind. Return your attention to your breath whenever you feel distracted.

6. Visualize yourself surrounded by a bright, healing light. Allow this light to fill your entire being, washing away any negative thoughts or emotions. Repeat a mantra to yourself, such as ""I release all attachment to negative thoughts"" or ""I am free from repetitive thought forms.""

7. When you are ready to end the meditation, take a few deep breaths and slowly open your eyes."	Bati_18	reply	na	na	na	0.005415584426373243	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

"Fuck if I know why I'm writing this. I'm just so tired of feeling mixed up inside. Long story short: a woman I had a very strong connection with who had been on extended hiatus reappeared in my life recently. She was my first true source of emotional affection outside of my family ( the EA I get from them feels obligatory because they are very loving but also stuck with me). She was the first person I actively romantically pursued and received and equivalent response, this caused me to cling to her very tightly because I am socially inept and finding something like that is very rare for me. We corresponded for 2ish years and shared many parts of ourselves but I pushed some of her boundaries without understanding that's what I was doing. This caused her hurt and I was unaware of it until she out and out messages me to that effect. 

Now that she's back I immediately reestablished contact and she was justifiably hesitant as my previous boundary stomping worries her that I might continue with that behavior. I apologized profusely and tried to make amends but she says it's going to be a long hard road to rebuild trust and connection. I'm solution oriented, when confronted with a problem I start looking for a way to solve it. There's just no given way forward with this, there's not a ton I can do to make improvements to our dynamic right away I just have to be respectful and patient. Logically I understand this but I'm in my emotion mind too much. Emotionally I just want to interact with her. She's understanding, and encouraging, and uplifting. She makes me feel like the best version of myself and without her I feel like a low polygon version of myself just low movement, low energy, low drive etc. 

All that pontificating out of the way I come to the question relating to the title of my post. Logically I should give up and move on. This way I don't cause either of us undue pain in trying to continue but I'm a stubborn SOB and I can't bring myself to let go of the chance of being with her. Does anyone know how to let things go when you're stubborn?"	Block-Money	post	21.59270355548141	male	White	0.0039993468672037125	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthIsland

You are absolutely right that there are people who care, I care for you. Please keep your head up, keep fighting because you can get better. Life is much more beautiful when we start to appreciate the little things, instead of getting caught up in social media and worrying about how other people view us and all this other distracting and demoralising stuff. 

I‚Äôm glad to hear that you want to carrying on living. Remember that life is full of ups and downs, it may at some points feel hopeless but it will get better. Try and take everyday day as it comes, take a step back because life can often feel chaotic so it‚Äôs helpful to take a step back and breathe. Also try and be kinder to yourself, you have been through a lot and it‚Äôs very easy for us to blame ourselves for that. Also have you tried therapy? It was very helpful for me. Also opening up to people you feel comfortable with (family, friends) is great help as well. 

I hope this helped and please stay strong. Have a wonderful day."	FIN_1937	reply	na	na	na	0.005373760592192411	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
It's very difficult to let go of my fur babies because they mean the world to me! Sure they can be a pain but then they probably think we are to them as well. I love my two cats and how much joy they give me! Been away from them has made things difficult because I miss them sleeping on my bed or just waking me up for food!

So I came out to help someone out. And in total of been happy with what's happened, I'm not. It's turned into an absolute nightmare. I'm fed up with it all. I don't get asked how are you in the morning, just an case of make me an coffee please. This for me is really upsetting and pisses me off. I say something and it's always Nope! Nope!... So then what am I meant to say? It's pointless! I try to prove things and constantly told I'm wrong. When I'm trying to explain my actions, it's an excuse. I can't win. I decided now that on Thursday, I'll simply leave. It's an shame because it was an friendship I wanted to keep but she ruined it.

"I had been experiencing terrible brain fog, fatigue, and memory loss (scary!) and decided to clear my brain of some of the pharmaceutical meds I was taking. I have been on a health journey (alcohol free 1 year!) and this was my next step. 

So, 3 weeks ago, I stopped Zolpidem (Ambien) 5 mg (10 years daily use) and Citalopram (Celexa) 40 mg (15 years every other day use) Cold Turkey.

Wow!! I didn‚Äôt realize this was actually pretty stupid and dangerous to do and I should have talked to my doc and tapered. The sleep issue surprisingly hasn‚Äôt been bad and I am sleeping 5-7 hours/night and only needed to use zz-quil around 5 nights to get to sleep. (I Stopped zz-quil now because, it too made me groggy in the morning) 

The shocker was how messed up I am emotionally from the Citalopram withdrawal! I didn‚Äôt realize that it‚Äôs a pretty powerful drug. I have used it for my general anxiety disorder and never ‚Äúfelt‚Äù it‚Äôs effects like you do with a faster acting benzo. 

I‚Äôm a hot mess with my moods, but funny, I thankfully don‚Äôt have any of the brain zaps others are experiencing. 

It‚Äôs been rough. I have been irritable, angry, bitchy, anxious, depressed, and for the first time had suicidal thoughts!! (I‚Äôm good now and passed those intrusive thoughts.)

I do not recommend going cold Turkey without a doctors permission, have a supportive friend or family member to keep on eye on you during the withdrawal, and seek help if you have suicidal thoughts. 

 My brain fog is gone and I am much more productive. 

 
Some of the helpful tools I have used are: 
- drinking Calm (magnesium drink) before bed 
- 1 gummy of Ashwagandha before bed 
- lorazepam (as needed when I‚Äôm really anxious)
- reduced my caffeine intake to 1 cup per day 
- listening to hypnosis or 528 hz podcasts with timer set when I go to sleep. 
- nature walks in the sun 
- listening to music 
- drink a lot of water to flush out the built up toxins"	Critical-Finance7162	reply	na	na	na	0.9993512034416199	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
Never ever stop medication that alters brain chemistry abruptly. The withdrawal is the worst. you gotta wean off it slowly. I used to take cymbalta and you want to die from the withdrawal symptoms from that. My mail order didn't deliver it in time so I was without it for 5 days. When I finally tried to wean down off it, it took me a year and half. Its one of the hardest antidepressants to ween off. I was on it for 6 years at the highest dose.  Just try taking the smallest dose you can and see if the symptoms go away after a few days. Then slowly decrease how often you are taking it. Its always best to ask the doctor who prescribed it though	Critical-Finance7162	reply	na	na	na	0.9993512034416199	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
"My psych and i have been meeting regularly weekly for months.  In some of these visits the brings in ""special guests""- other psychologists, psychiatrists, etc, within the circle she practices in. 

I've been feeling very... sick, for lack of a better word... for a while.  I can go to work and do the things,  but many normal human interactions either feel completely foreign,  or they have the emotional equivalent in me of slapping someone with a sunburn. Meaning everything either hurts in an excruciating way or is so unrelatable to my own life experiences that i feel like an alien.

Add to that suffocating guilt,  a chronic feeling of emptiness and worthlessness,  isolation, and unrealistically high standards of productivity, and you get me... basically a hot mess. 

All this time something has felt missing.  PTSD, depression, anxiety, dissociation... they all feel like symptoms of something deeper.  

Today i found out what that might be.  The psychiatrist wants us to explore treatment for the ""quiet borderline, "" which he said is a subset of BPD often misdiagnosed.

I'm scared but over the moon. It makes sense to me.  This may be the answer I've been looking for, for years and years.

"Please excuse my bad grammar. English isn't my first language. Here's gist of my background, I had to go through brutal bullying in school during my teenaghood for maybe 5 years. I have some traumatic experiences 7 years ago with religion/work/friendship and my relationship with parents. This experience pretty much shattered my foundation/ identity. I had to go through a journey alone to find myself. There was nobody to talk to about the loss, rage, abandonment, and shame I felt. This ended up me bottling up my intense anger. One day, I couldn't hold my rage anymore, I just had to unleash it with violence. Just for your information, I didn't hurt anyone or my pet. It was mostly self harm and breaking my property. Ever since that door ""violence"" was opened, it never really closed. Im scared that it will eventually ruin my life. Small wind of stress can easily prop open my ""violence""."

"""Violence"" in this sense is your body being frustrated. You were helpless and being abused. That bottles up and builds up pent up anger. It might feel good... but once that door is opened, it is very hard to close. I was very physically destructive due to abuse.

One day I caught myself, when I was very angry. I felt the sense of rage coming on. Then a voice popped in my head:

""You dont... really want to do it do you? You know what's going to happen afterwards"".

After reminding myself of that several times, I had the biggest headache ever. But it's allowed me to control my anger ever since.

I‚Äôm sorry you are going through this. I can tell you have been hurt by people who are supposed to love and care for you, and it‚Äôs really disheartening you have had to struggled alone. But you are not broken, and you have done an incredible thing by noticing it and asking for help. It shows that you are more than just your anger, you want to get better, and you will get better. Your traumas have disregulated your nervous system to a point where even seemingly small stimuli or situations can trigger a big reaction. If you don‚Äôt have access to a therapist or a person who can help you find ways to regulate your emotions in a healthy way please look online and do some searching, trial and error for what works best for you. Keep posting online, talk to someone, join a group, or start journaling about everything you feel, and in the moments where you can feel the anger building up inside your body, focus on your breath to center yourself. Be patient with yourself and give yourself grace. Your mental health is important and healing takes time. You are more than your emotions. We are all in this together - best of luck on your journey.

"From one formerly aggressive, and I mean *aggressive* person to another person attempting to let it go, I only have this to say - when you catch yourself in bouts of intense anger, *try to take a step back*. It‚Äôs not easy because you‚Äôre basically re-wiring your brain‚Äôs response to situations. It‚Äôll be difficult and there will be times you‚Äôll want to lose it. Don‚Äôt. 

This expression of anger feels fucking good but making aggression and violence a part of your style of response is, at the end of the day, destructive to you. 

I was a person who used to take anger out through aggression against others and myself, mostly myself. It‚Äôs not a fun position to be in. 

I hope you this helps you, my friend.

"I'm a little over half way through but I guess it's ok. Still sitting in class trying to concentrate and stuff but it's hard. I started taking adderall prescribed to me for my ADHD and this is the 3rd day I'm on it so I'm still trying to see the effects. I feel different but idk how to describe it, like I feel like I'm talking and more outgoing when I'm on the meds, but it kills my mental state. Like when I'm on adderall, I feel like my issues get cranked up a few notches, same with my ADHD, it feels like it's 2x worse than what it originally was. I haven't sh for a few days and I'm getting frustrated cause I'm starting to crave it again and I wanna try to start doing it again. 

I also find that I'm writing way more stuff and speaking more than I should. Like on this comment and on other reddit posts and stuff I'm writing essays and stuff for simple questions or topics. Same deal when I'm talking to friends and people I just talk and keep talking and keep jumping between different topics and stuff. It just feels like a weird feeling, similar to being tipsy when drinking or something, but I don't feel dizzy or stuff like that. Idk it's really hard to describe but so far the day is going about the same as usual so thank you for asking, I hope your day is going good :)

I feel super weird about an interaction with a coworker and we tried this disgusting ice cream, but I feel like I said too much and overshared on a weird situation with a coworker from my old location just being a little screwy.

I help 2 people I randomly met online overcoming some interesting mental health problems. But I‚Äôm proud of the 2 of them very much. One of them wanted to hear me vent lol. But sadly I can‚Äôt really vent without doing something bad now. But hey on the other hand they finally got the chance to talk about their own experiences that they might have been having problems with. I‚Äôm just glad I was finally able to help someone. It‚Äôs nice to hear thank you more then ‚Äústay away or you might get hurt‚Äù it‚Äôs nice to know you had an impact on someone‚Äôs mental health even though you don‚Äôt even know each other l. I think hearing things or just simply reading about someone else going through something is soothing for me idk why I like it but I have alway felt like literally to every single thing that person needs to let go of their feelings the pain in their heart and soul is like a sad song finally ending is climax. This is something I tend to do in my free time when I get the chance to it‚Äôs just so good to be able to listen to them and help them be comfortable with themselves and needs. What do you think?

So I have a 13 year old daughter and she is bloody testing my patience. She is the most arrogant/antagonistic person I have ever met. She's admitted she doesn't care about my rules that she keeps breaking. Harrases me when she can use the net after I ground her for sneaking on the net. She's not comprehending that she's in trouble or she just has no respect. If I yell at her she screams in my face. I have 4 younger children under her and the are starting to copy her with disrespect. She got caught shop lifting, I had to go pay it... and she was just like yeah so.  She is purposly cutting herself but little super ficial ones and telling people at her school for them to feel sorry for her. Which is making me angry as I grew up around a mother who suffered with this and would gash herself. I just don't know what to do or where to turn.

"Didn't have any suicidal ideations for 5 days. Although I tried inflict scratches on my body but it wasn't serious. My soul still hurts... a lot. But I woke up and trimmed my beard. I felt better.

 Of course feeling better is a very slow progress, and I still feel the darkness but I'm not blind. My surroundings is foggy but at least I can still watch my steps. During these travellings sometimes I find an abandoned camp left by another person and some notes, I rest there for a while and read theirs , and find out they were here long time ago and their experiences... I don't know them but I can feel other souls in the past and present. I need to bandage my hand, so it can be healed. It's time to rest for a bit while watching the stars shining in distance through this dark sky.

Edit: couldn't sleep... I feel the damages when I can't sleep. I need to be kind to myself and hug my mind and having some sleep before that intrusive thoughts gets worse... counting stars may help"		post	23.32554218540736	female	White	0.00418836111202836	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

"These past few weeks have been very sad and really just made me realize how lonely I am. I know it sounds stupid to be talking about relationship stuff here, I honestly don't know where else I could be writing this down.

""Am I weird?"" is the question that always gets stuck in my brain. It doesn't help that I identify as Non Binary. I try to look as good as I possibly can, but it really seems like it's when I start talking that makes people go the other way. I'm struggling to build any kind of romantic connection.

I really worked hard on finally being able to accept or like myself even a little bit only to find that I'm not ""date"" material.

It seems to be taking a toll on me and I don't seem to know where to place myself. I can see myself being the weird kid seated in the back of the class again."	yshbrws	post	14.762540623988874	male	White	0.9974344372749329	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthIsland

"Currently, talking about that chronophobia stuff, it's better by now. Didn't even think about that until recently which makes me feel kinda nervous/stressed again but not to a point where I can't do anything.  
Another matter, my parents kinda hate me right now (or at least don't really care about me) and I also do I hate myself too (not absolute hate, rather disliking) and I feel mentally trapped right now. Never got the motivation to do stuff and my plans with the uni are off now since I couldn't find any place because I didn't have a guarantor which almost always gets asked for in germany.

"The first time was with this girl who I was talking to and got to hang out with and stuff. Then her and I really didn‚Äôt talk much and I was afraid to text her cause I‚Äôm never comfortable making the first move or anything. I later found out through one of her friend‚Äôs social media posts that she had been seeing this other guy and was now dating him. 

So flash-forward a month later I meet this other girl at the school cafeteria through a few other friends. Her and I were talking to each other about stuff for like 3 hours before I had to go. Like half an hour later I look on social media to learn that she already has a bf. 

I feel as if anytime I try to talk with a girl and stuff, it‚Äôs 1 step forward, 5 steps backward. I‚Äôm starting to give up on dating and relationships cause I know that any girl I talk to or get interested in either has a bf or isn‚Äôt interested in me. I‚Äôm probably gonna end up dying alone :/

"Theres this chick within the group of friends I‚Äôm part of. Growing up her & her sister were always very well known for physically fighting. Mostly in high school & early adulthood. Now as adults & mothers they have chilled out & matured but there‚Äôs been a couple times it‚Äôs happened again. I was out with one of them recently at a concert & she almost initiated a fight because the crowd kept pushing her (this was happening to everyone) but she is very petite. She‚Äôs been really nice to me now but I feel the need to tip toe around her just in case.

There were a couple times in high school where she, her sister, & other friends tried to jump me. I had just been introduced to the group & they were jealous that I was being brought around more, getting close to everyone. I was always able to talk my way out of it lol I never learned how to fight or defend myself. Wish I did. Parents were real strict cause of the area we were in but they‚Äôre controlling narcs too but anyways.

We grew up & live in ‚Äúthe hood‚Äù where physically fighting is extra normalized. Most of my friends have been in physical fights at some point or wouldn‚Äôt be afraid to get down now as adults. Even within my family it is normalized. I‚Äôve seen my aunts & uncles get down with friends/family. Sometimes they make up & become closer than before, sometimes they don‚Äôt. 

Am I being too sensitive here? What if when any of these people I mentioned (or anyone who resorts to physical fighting) puts another in the hospital? Or one wrong move/slip, someone hits their head or whatever & it causes permanent damage? Is this not possible or a concern at all? Is it too far fetched? What does it mean about these people? Are they mentally ill? Does it matter that it doesn‚Äôt happen as often as before or at all anymore?"

"I don't think you're being too sensitive. I think you bring up some good points... but no one here is able to make a diagnosis, so whether or not they are truly mentally ill is hard to say. 

I will say that, in my experience,  people who react aggressively typically have underlying reasons for doing so.  Meaning they may feel as if they must be ""dominant"" to be seen or respected, or maybe it's simply the only coping mechanism they have.  

Whatever the reason, you're right to keep them at arm's length, and you definitely bring up valid concerns about what the potential outcomes of these outbursts could be.  

I hope they're somehow able to recognize that aggressiveness isn't necessarily the best way to handle an uncomfortable situation eventually... for their sake and the sake of others.  üíú"	PerformerSmart9941	reply	na	na	na	0.012821149080991745	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

"I don't feel unhappy, I don't really suffer.

But through the years I feel like my enjoyment of life becomes less and less with time. 

One of the biggest thing for me is music. Like most people, I used to love music and listen to it all the time, loved discovering new artists, etc. Now I basically don't feel anything when I hear some and don't have the drive to listen to it. I feel pretty much indifferent to everything, visual arts don't elicit any reaction, beautiful natural scenes either, I don't get sad watching sad movies,‚Ä¶

I just feel generally emotionally indifferent. I don't have passions, dreams or goals. I have some interests, but they're mostly intellectual, which makes for a dull life and a sense of meaninglessness. 

Dead inside really sums it up well.

I feel sad and jealous of people who love music or art, who are engaged with life, moved and touched by nature or beauty, who care about things and people‚Ä¶

I really would like to know about other people who feel similarly. And if you do, how did you get there? Have you been like this for a long time? Do you have an idea what caused it?

Hey I‚Äôm sorry you are feeling that way. I feel that way sometimes too. Most things I do enjoy doing, I tend to not enjoy anymore, but the best thing I do is go over what I have learned. Maybe take some deep breaths. I hope you have better days ahead of you	bipolarquickquestion	reply	na	na	na	0.9991600513458252	strong	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
"Short answer, yes. ""Anhedonia"" is a term that means an inability to enjoy things you used to take pleasure from. It's a symptom of more than one mental illness, clinical depression being one of the most common. 

*For me*, a severe bout of this particular symptom is a red flag. It means I can't or am not emotionally refuelling. It's a slippery slope from there.

I see a therapist, or used to, on a regular basis to help keep things in check. I need professional help. It may be something to discuss with a mental health provider or even your GP (general practitioner), if you haven't already.

The good news is, it's temporary. The bad news is, you can't ignore it."	bipolarquickquestion	reply	na	na	na	0.9991600513458252	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

Emotional and mental burnout can lead to feeling the way you are right now. It isn‚Äôt a good place to be in at all, and I‚Äôm sorry you find yourself there. 

I hope you get better. I hope you find the joy in things as you did before. Or a newfound joy in something entirely new to you.

I started feeling like this beginning in graduate school. I used to be unstoppable and interested in doing so much, but that somehow vanished over a period of a couple of years. I've spent the last 2 years trying to recover and become interested in things again and its gotten better, but i think i def need help still but havent reached out. I really lost who I was during my burnout and my life became pointless. I'm not that sad, but I'm also never really happy. I'm just here and I think what you feel has become a normal reaction to how we are forced to live.

Sometimes it's really hard for me keep my mental and physical issues both in balance. Feeling weak because my body can't be healed at least for another year and it makes me impatient and worse. I need to remind myself my physical health doesn't change my soul and my value as a person. It's gonna be ok, even if dark thoughts ambush me again.

Depression is insidious. It affects not only your mood, but also your ability to feel, think, and function. At it‚Äôs worst, shuts down hope. For that reason, your physical health doesn‚Äôt defined you as a person. The most important thing is that you‚Äôre trying your best to rehabilitate the mind and body.

"I'm so sorry to hear about this! You deserve better. ü´Çüò• Hopefully we can talk soon?

I had my first full day at Target yesterday, second day overall. It was mostly computer training, which was surprisingly overwhelming. I will retain about five percent of that new information


Then helped with a time sensitive collection of customer pick ups for delivery; Another training. You have thirty minutes once you start picking up refrigerated and frozen goods to get them back into their respective cold holding areas. You collect for several guests at once.

I worked with someone experienced, and he was great. I don't know the store, which was not great.

It was very stressful and I learned that I was just being cross trained. If I had to do that regularly I would leave. It's not what I signed on for.

Hopefully today will be better. I took a major pay cut, about one third less than I was making, to find something I thought I could sustain.

"I haven't felt good about myself in a long time, like, there will be this weird spontaneous burst of confidence and then? Nothing. I would (and probably still kinda will) hate my appearance and then next thing you know I hate my body and my personality. You know? The whole shabang. 

This time I know it's different.

I look at myself in the mirror a bit more now, there were times where I would look at myself and just cry cause I hated it so much. When I look in the mirror now? I give myself the baddie girl talk like: ""Damn GURL you look SNATCHED"" or ""You are just BOSSSIN up for the BETTER!"" It GENUINELY makes me feel good. I finally recognize my self worth and respect myself more than ever before. 

As soon as I started loving myself, this weight on my chess, or a headache (every now and then), it just goes away. I'm finally happy all on my own. I really don't know how long this will last but I hope it lasts as long as it can because, this is GREAT! I'm embracing myself with open arms.

If there is anyone out there that doesn't feel good about yourself? Just know that it takes time, try to get to know and welcome yourself again. It can be as slow and as gradual as it needs to be . If you feel bad about yourself you should take a moment and try to find where the proof is, sometimes the brain makes it's job to trick us into believing terrible things about ourselves. We are not really terrible, we just make mistakes, but allow those mistakes to be lessons for the future.

"I have written a lot of posts over the past few weeks on the topic of self-harm, and how the urge runs deeply, even after periods of non-harm. I have also discussed my history of self-harm and how long it has been since I've engaged in this, but how sometimes, I still have the urge.   


The urge today has been stronger than it has been in some time...perhaps years.   


Multiple things have happened in a short period of time which have reactivated these feelings in me. I haven't done it, but I would be lying if I said that I didn't want to. It is a struggle to fight against that urge, even after over a decade without using a blade. If the frustration, anger, hopelessness becomes too great, the old feelings resurface. And I have to somehow regroup and rewind, which often means crying until I am exhausted, writing about my feelings, or making a audio-blog recording about what I'm feeling.  But the urge doesn't go away.   


I just wanted to let anyone out there struggling with this to know that, despite everything I've said, I still also fight against the urges, and it's not easy. I'm there with you."	mrsheartbroken	post	14.278953480380745	male	White	0.0054120514541864395	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

"I‚Äôm 21 years old and I live with my parents in the UK. I currently work a part time retail job 16 hours a week. I currently have an ongoing health issue for almost 3 years which requires me to lose loads of weight and potentially get surgery to fix it. I have a surgeon appointment booked for this November. I‚Äôm currently losing weight and gradually getting to my target whilst waiting on this appointment.

The health condition has physically and mentally affected me in a very negative way. I‚Äôm not happy with my life at all, I feel horrible. As I currently live with my parents they ask me to pay them around ¬£150 a month. I do my own laundry and everything else. I have around ¬£4000 in my bank account from saving. 

The reason I‚Äôm saying this is because I‚Äôm not happy with my life and my body so I honestly don‚Äôt see the reason to work currently. I‚Äôm constantly depressed, I‚Äôm not happy and surely my coworkers can sense this as well. I was also meant to go to University a few years ago but due to this health condition I didn‚Äôt go. 

I just feel like I‚Äôm putting everything in front of my health and my own body and for what? ¬£650 a month in a job which I mostly hate with poor health? What‚Äôs the point? I don‚Äôt want to do retail, I want to fix my health and go to University. I‚Äôm currently not happy at all. 

I feel like a slave. I feel like a mug for listening to everyone else‚Äôs pointless expectations when I should‚Äôve just applied for sickness benefits until all of this is sorted and I‚Äôm happy again and then I can go to University."	lifedeath21	post	37.03999352534639	female	White	0.9989237189292908	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthIsland

"Oh dear.  I hope you've been able to sleep a little by now.  I know when I'm tired it just seems to exacerbate all of my negative feelings, which then makes me unable to sleep... its a cycle. 

And no,  you're the farthest thing from a devil.  Everyone in this subreddit knows what a loving heart you have, and how empathetic you are with everyone's struggles.  You are a pillar of support to so many people... but you mustn't forget you deserve the same kindness and patience that you give to others. 

That's tricky.  I am guilty of being far more critical and unkind to myself than i ever would be to another person.  I have to step away from myself sometimes and say... "" what would you say to another person who tells you they are feeling this way?"" And then, i try to extend that very thing to myself. I'm really amazed at how that simple question sometimes turns my entire thought process around.

If I have something that I don't want to do I force myself to do it for 10 mins and then treat myself to doing something fun. The getting up and getting started is the hardest part. Sometimes I breakdown the chore into sections and finish one section at a time. Like doing the dishes. One section would be unloading the dishwasher, load dishwasher, wipe counters, sweep floor, mop. No matter what you accomplish even if it is only one section it is a good start. Also treat yourself to some meditation or stretching or a nice walk.  ü§ç	MikeWheeler10	reply	na	na	na	0.9991382360458374	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
My negative and critical self talk is what leads me into low motivation and depression. Most of the time I am my own worst ally and can spin with my own thoughts. If the self talk is really not helpful I have found talking with a trusted therapist/friend can really be grounding just being heard or receiving a different perspective. For me the shift in perception/mindset or realization of distorted thoughts leads me back into motivation/production mode via self love and compassion.

"(TW) I find a lot of my motivation through fear or just forcing myself to do something because I feel I have to do it in order to please someone else or make myself feel like I‚Äôm useful, which I‚Äôm not. 

Like for example, I‚Äôve been setting a wierd mental schedule where I have to cut myself a certain amount of times a day before 12:00am or else the next day I have to cut myself twice as much. I try to use fear to give myself the energy to do it, even when I really don‚Äôt want to do it. Same thing with my duolingo cause I‚Äôm trying to keep up a streak of 650+ days, and if I ever lose it, I‚Äôll have to cut myself. 

So in short I just use fear and punishment into completing certain activities, even though I punish myself regardless if I get the task(s) done or not. I highly recommend you DON‚ÄôT do what I do because it‚Äôs not healthy. 

I think trying to set up some other sort of reward or something for completing tasks can work a lot better. Maybe let‚Äôs say ‚Äòif I complete this or that today, I can have ice cream or some fruit or something after dinner tonight‚Äô. Idk if that works better but hopefully you can find a strategy to help make your life a bit easier.

"When I find myself lacking motivation I take the day off. I shut my laptop, step away from my work desk and do something fun. May watch a movie, sleep, or do anything that I was thinking of when trying to work. It pushes me to work the next day because I know that now that I have taken a day off I can start working from tomorrow.

Also when I'm distracted or demotivated but still try to work, I don't actually get anything done but still feel like I did work just because I was at my desk. So taking that break helps to really seperate break/not doing anything from working."	MikeWheeler10	reply	na	na	na	0.9991382360458374	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
I‚Äôm not me, but it‚Äôs been so long I don‚Äôt even know who I am anymore, I think this is who I am now. I don‚Äôt sleep, sometimes 3 nights in a row with not a single minute of sleep. I am so alone, I have very few family and friends and what little I do have I feel I have isolated myself from them all for so long. In the same breath when I was around them I just feel so disinterested in interacting and found my mind was always elsewhere, it all just felt like too much work. On the rare occasion I do see them I feel guilty for being shit, I can pick up from them that they aren‚Äôt enjoying my company and are there out of obligation. I feel I have made them all hate me or at the very least not want to be around me, which is fair I don‚Äôt even want to be around me. I quit my job and now have nothing, but I couldn‚Äôt handle being abused for a living, that guilt and panic for leaving without a plan is so heavy. My home is a disgusting mess, I tell myself I will start on it everyday and just never get there. My personal hygiene has taken a massive hit, I feel so gross but just can‚Äôt muster up the energy to do something about it. I have long hair I have wanted my whole life that is matted and painful to even try to fix. I feel my relationship is falling apart and I‚Äôm neglecting my dog. I am overweight, over eating and embarrassed to leave my house. I finally got set up for a psychologist and my first session was horrible where the guy spoke non stop and rambled shit, I barely spoke. I need to do something, but finding a new psychologist feels so tedious for the same thing to happen again for an exhausting hour long session. It‚Äôs too much, I can‚Äôt do it. I am tired.

1. Wash your hands
2. Brush your teeth 
3. Throw away 1 single piece of garbage into a garbage can
4. Pick up 1 piece of dirty clothing and put it in the laundry bag

"I have a decent job, I go to the gym, and most of all, nothing makes me angry.  There are a lot of things in my life that should make me angry, but I immediately forgive others and say its no big deal.  I want to get into a cause that helps others and do things that are very giving.  

But the moment I think about my brother I genuinely get angry.  I think of awful things I could say to him. I want him to be sad.  In a world where I wasn't angry and I forgave him, I don't even like the guy so I would still want nothing to do with him.  Since more ""recent events"" occurred it has only escalated.  Most of the time, I try to ignore it all.  Distract myself.  Pretend that nothing happened.  But most days he is on my mind and I get angry at nothing.  I yell at him while walking down the sidewalk.  

I have made many attempts to see a therapist to no avail.  I don't feel like talking about the events that happened between my brother."	LizzSaldana94	post	11.430707176536814	female	White	0.9951424598693848	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthIsland

"The rest bitch face. Known in some cultures as ‚Äòa cunt‚Äô.

I have nothing to facade. You see me as me. I dont have the energy please others of consume their opinions of what I look like. 

But today was another story. I have started work in a cooperate environment with a big team. One of our team members loves to press their opinions on people. He is well respected even though he gossips? (Make that make sense). Without even a second thought he tells me that I have a rbf. Not an ordinary one either. One that makes me off unapproachable, harsh & intimidating. 

Anyone that knows me‚Äô knows that I am terrified of the thought of conflict. Inflated egos press my nerves and I don‚Äôt react well to conflict in the slightest. As someone that has been told their whole life that wearing my emotions and how I look has always been a negative; I am not ok.

Its one thing for one person to say it, but others joined in to say I in-fact do come off intimidating. I, LIKE ANYONE ELSE wants to feel appreciated and like they are loved in community. 

I have always had thoughts that maybe its because Im black or gay but now I just think its my spirit. Am I that uncomfortable to everyones presence that I consume them with the thought of running away? 

Anything I ever want is to feel like I belong. I am really shaken up by it and left work early.

"Sounds kind of like we have yet another thing in common.  

I just don't have a passively happy face...i don't.  I've literally been asked to ""look"" more approachable.  Not at my current job, but in the past (government work= nobody gives a shit lol). 

While this has bothered me in the past, over time, I've realized it's a weird superpower.  People can see on my face when it's time to talk or not a good time, and I'm left alone when necessary.  Also, people automatically assume I'm not going to take any crapp (although at the end of the day,  LOATHE conflicts and will do anything to avoid them).

My current trainee recently admitted i was a bit intimidating and she only now feels comfort now that she knows me.  That stings a little but i guess it earned me a modicum of respect in the beginning,  as she figured she had to step it up for me. 

Anyway... anyone who gets to know you, like we have,  knows you're super approachable and willing to do whatever you can for someone else.

"Safe,

How you're feeling is 100% valid. 

It is totally normal at a new job to be a little bit in your shell. You've got have time to get comfortable in a new space.


You have to feel out the vibe of a new group, and  get comfortable communicating.

You have to learn what being there physically means.  Getting used to the space--moving around other people, passing them in the hallway, making eye contact or not, saying hi and so on. 

These are all things that take time and effort.

For someone to tell you that *you*  are the intimidating and cold one when you've recently joined a new group is quite the dig and it's not fair.

Sounds like this person / people think that busting chops is how they relate to people. That can be really tough when you're new.

Consider that this person didn't say that to you understanding it would get to you the way it has. It may just be how they know how to relate to people and they don't even understand they're being mean. 

If you want to, consider telling them that it really got to you. 

You were thinking about who knows what and to be told you're intimidating just being in a space makes it really tough for you to feel comfortable.

Also, consider taking a deep breath and saying ""it was just a joke, and that's an issue on their end.""

Say to yourself (as if you're talking to them): That sounds like a you problem."	SafeInside6750	reply	na	na	na	0.9960850477218628	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
I'm sorry to hear that you're going through that, it must be tough to feel like you're being judged for something you can't control. It's important to remember that other people's opinions of you don't define who you are. Just because someone said you have a resting bitch face, doesn't mean that's who you are as a person. It's important to focus on the positive aspects of yourself and your personality instead of dwelling on negative things that others say about you. Maybe you could try doing something to showcase your approachable side, like smiling more or asking others how their day is going. Remember, you deserve to feel appreciated and included in your community, and it's important to surround yourself with people who accept and value you for who you are.

You sound to me as someone that is adept at spotting fakes and this guy knew it and was trying to bring you down so he could keep his status. You should just keep being you, eventually this guy will get what's coming to him.

"Each day that passes I feel another part of me is fading. This room is dark, there's no window... don't even know if it's day or night. Lost tracking the time. I can't find the key for the door either. I just hear my own voice and him. The room's wall is cold and touching it reminds me of a soundless death. I can't see anything, there's no light here... it feels like floating in space, it's somehow peaceful but it's painful that I don't know what's happening around me. Not sure if my eyes are closed or open... seems my body doesn't care either. I'm in love with the demon though, at least he's beside me, can't see him but hearing a voice in this silence can be comforting. At least fire can burn things and bring chaos... well I'm just tired of this darkness and fire can light this room for me. Maybe fire can burn the room's door and set me free...

"I wish you were feeling better! 

I must say, you describe the pain, darkness, and isolation of depression as well as anyone I've ever seen. Your writing is very expressive and evocative.

That said, I hope you have the opportunity to experience a gentle, loving approach to yourself. I know how hard that is, at least for me. I haven't dealt with your past or present trauma either, and I can't imagine how hard it is to get through each day.

Please remember that the view you have of yourself is not shared by those in this community. We care about you deeply.

I need to vent a little. Everything and every one seems to be yelling around me. I know its my anxiety. It‚Äôs been hard lately. Just knowing the truth needs to come out soon. Lately I have been broke which is a first for me in like 10+ years. I need a divorce but am struggling to reach that goal to reach my ultimate transitioning goals. I need to be the person that I have felt I am inside. Im tired of living a lie. But I am terrified of the changes I must undertake. I sit wondering if finally turning in my prescription and starting HRT will give me a push to make the changes I need to live for me‚Ä¶. I just feel so tired lately‚Ä¶ I dont enjoy waking up.. I don‚Äôt feel safe in my own house even though I am. I feel like I can be by myself‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs frustrating me. It scares me. I hate divorce. I hate change. I feel like I cant be the solution to anything. I feel helpless. I forget to breathe sometimes.

I applaud you for taking whatever steps in whatever order you have to take them-any movement is better than stagnation, if it's for the ultimate end goal.

I understand your feelings. Transition is a paradox. The more something frightens you the more you need to face it. If you think about it every day then you need to do something about it. Small steps like growing your hair out, taking T blockers, taking E, you never know how far you will go until you take the first step. Life is like a box of chocolates,you never know what you are going to get. Relationships are hard.  Your spouse. Your family. You have a relationship with yourself. Both of you, your he vs she. The internal conflict is so tiring. As one side grows the other dies. Transition is the journey from conflict to inner peace. How far that journey goes is entirely up to you. You will know when you get there.	Glittering_Layer_602	reply	na	na	na	0.9926815629005432	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

"Hello,

Today I really hate myself. It's... hatred. I'm 30 yrs old, very fat. I remember my 6-7 yrs old self who tries not to eat when she's hungry. Not to eat at all. It's easier. Not eat at all, than eat a little and stop.

I remember the kid who tries again and again and again... More than twenty years gone and I always tried to lose weight and finally always gave up. I can't do this in the healthy way and I don't have the strenght for the unhealthy version. (We don't have specials. Not affordable ones.)

Six months ago my friend got sick. He has to take several medicine and go for walks. I did it with him. I encouraged him, take walks together to help him not give up. It was good.

And now, on last Saturday I hurt my back.

Today we took a walk again. I was suffered after a few meters.

I helped him to do this but I was proud of myself too for doing it. But today... I feel like it was for nothing. Six months again for nothing.

I feel pure hatred for myself and I don't know how to carry on. I'll anyway. Just... don't know how. Don't know how not to feel this uncontrollable hatred."	Near9182	post	43.555694614333106	female	White	0.9986194372177124	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

"Yesterday I didn't intend for my session to turn into a recollection of the events of 2020 that led to my grandmother's passing. I didn't intend to talk about her maltreatment, or the diagnoses that they missed, or the fact they nearly let her die so many times I lost count.   


I didn't expect to talk about the rage and helplessness that I felt at that point in my life. But what's more, I didn't expect for the wave of corresponding emotions to hit me like a tidal wave.   


I felt everything that I felt in 2020. It wasn't as if I've forgotten how horrible it all was, or how it affected me...but I'd filed it away somewhere so that I can function. But in talking about it, all of the fear, rage, helplessness and grief just...well, it consumed me.   


At the end of the session, I told her I felt like I was going to vomit. I heaved a couple of times, but never did actually get sick. I've never had that reaction in a session, not even during EMDR. I think recalling the emotions, sights, smells, was too much. Especially when I told her about the food that I had sent to my grandmother to eat, and the facility never refrigerated it...so on our last visit together, the room stunk of rotten yogurt and puddings (that should have been refrigerated at least a month prior, but had been sitting in a bag for that long). They had assured me that they had not only refrigerated it, but were giving it to her to eat--just one of countless lies that I was told during those 7 months.   


And the final indignity--not telling me that she was at the end, and not calling me, or letting me see her, but allowing a non-family, ex-employee to visit her the night before she died. 

Recalling this was just too much. And today, all day, I've not been myself.   


I guess I didn't realize how much I've had to endure in such a short span of time, from 2020 to the current issues that I'm facing. And it occurred to me yesterday that even those closest to me have no clue how much this all did to me, and is still doing to me--from my grandmother's dehumanization to her death, to the loss of my partner and his family... it's all very alienating and infuriating, so much so that when today, at lunch, coworkers were talking about their family relationships and such, I realized I had nothing to share. Nothing to contribute.   


That feeling made me feel so...inhuman. Panicked. 

I'm managing,  but I can't stop feeling those feelings that were dredged up. I feel quite ill, still, especially when I talk with others about their families or similar things.  


It's just interesting to me that something can happen to us, and we don't realize how bad it really was until we talk through it again, after not really speaking about it for a long time."	mrsheartbroken	post	29.56768949185766	male	White	0.9914904236793518	na	na	na	4	MentalHealthIsland

"God, I feel you. I suffered something similar... 

They know that you loved them, and wherever they are now they know in their heart of hearts that you loved them too. They wouldn't want this regret and suffering for you. It is not your fault. No matter what you think, say, or were doing, it is NOT your fault and they knew that. 

I had a similar experience right before 2020. My grandpa passed away and I got the news on Thanksgiving at my grandma-in-laws home doing my rounds for dinners. I booked a ticket that night to go comfort my grieving grandmother, and as I landed on my way home I learned my mother's mother was in the hospital...

I buried that in a lot of things. Work, hobbies, drinking. There were many things happening, but this drove me over an edge. I ignored it except in long car drives alone on the way home from work. That festering wound eventually popped in a not-healthy way. I was drunk on a week day and gushing horror onto my fianc√©. That ended in me calling off work and being a newly shattered person all over again. I'm glad you're doing this process through a professional. 

It was like burying something fresh in my soul, then coming back months later to dig it up all spoiled. It hurt like hell, but I won't preach to the choir. 

It seems that you're with a therapist who has been helping you lance these lesions as they come up in therapy. I know it hurts like hell, but its better with a professional than with yourself and your thoughts. I went through some *dark* fucking times, and I promise you that I wish I had gone through it with a therapist by my side rather than alone at 6am. The last thing you want to do is talk this out by yourself. Having someone to talk with is very important, which is something I found out very abruptly with my fianc√©, who is my saint for helping me through that.  

I'm thankful every day for the people I can lean on when I cannot be the rock I want to be for my fiance who is going through her own issues. I'm thankful for those who are gone, because they are still a part of me in deep and meaningful ways. 

I'm truly terribly sorry for your loss, and the awful experiences you both went through, but they wouldn't want you to dwell on them anymore in that light.

"This is a very hard topic opening up to talk about.. Please be kind when you see this post, and before you respond, stop to think how you would feel in my situation‚Ä¶ is your comment really helpful or should you keep your opinion to yourself and keep going.

With that being said.. I‚Äôll begin by giving some back story to give you an idea in our lives and 9 year relationship. My boyfriend is my best friend, he‚Äôs my person, my human who understands me, and I understand him.. I‚Äôm his person, his best friend.. We got together in the beginning of 2014.. I had just gotten out of an incredibly toxic, mentally and physically abusive relationship with my high school boyfriend of 7 years.. (as you can see I‚Äôm a relationship girl, I‚Äôve never been single in my adult life.. as I digress) 
When my current boyfriend and I got together being with him made me feel safe, he made me feel loved, seen, wanted, desired.. I felt the love we all want and need in a partner. In return I provided the stability, love, and safe haven for him. We were on the same frequency level, our energies collided, and it was on. We finished each other‚Äôs sentences, we‚Äôre always hungry for the same foods.. same sense of humor, the similarities yet differences between us fit..We just clicked together, both finding the missing half we‚Äôd been needing.. he‚Äôs my twin flame.. and I his twin flame, but in being twin flames the relationship of 9 years has not been easy. There‚Äôs been so many lessons, tribulations, heartache and pain that has made me question at times why I‚Äôm even still here‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs had some very hard times in his life before we were together and during, but throughout it all I stood by his side, even when he did not deserve my forgiveness, kindness or trust. No matter what fucked up situation was taking place, we always got through it, together.. us against the world..at the end of the day I love him. It‚Äôs hard to see myself being with anyone else.. I only see him. Which is why this current situation is so heartbreaking and difficult. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.. 
Before I can even begin to explain the hearing voices situation there‚Äôs something else that‚Äôs needed to be known. You see now in the past my boyfriend wasn‚Äôt always a law abiding citizen, who didn‚Äôt keep the best company around.. BUT that all changed and stopped. He changed his life around for the better, and was doing so great! He was starting up a new business, going to school, working full time, just handling life, he was happy.. or so I thought.. 
In 2021 I started a new job which requires all my time Monday - Friday, up at 4:00am, drive an hour to work, work full 8 hours, drive hour home, doing this while finishing up my degree. I was focusing on myself for the first time in a long time, just as I thought he was focusing on himself so we both could grow and achieve the goals we have.. but then the switch was flipped.. Here we begin the roller coaster I‚Äôm currently trying to survive. You see this all started around August 2021.. one of my boyfriends past friends started coming around the house, at first I didn‚Äôt mind it because he was a buddy of mine in the past (only through my boyfriend) well this ‚Äúfriend‚Äù of his was still a scumbag doing scumbag things. The friend asked to use my boyfriend‚Äôs phone and idk what this guy did, but that near moment set us on this path we‚Äôre on. It started out by my boyfriend saying he‚Äôs being followed everywhere, his phone is hacked and there‚Äôs now a federal investigation taking place and he‚Äôs being watched by this neighborhood watch program that the fbi has developed‚Ä¶ Everyone around us according to my boyfriend is apart of the investigation and their watching us. Nothing I say to him could get him to change him mind‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just gotten worse and worse at this point. He comes up with these illogical ideas and he is not able to separate reality from intrusive thoughts. Whenever I would say something he‚Äôd tell me I‚Äôm wrong and I‚Äôm against him‚Ä¶ now to bring us to present time‚Ä¶ this investigation idea has become so bad he fully believes people have broken into our house and planted nano cameras and microphones to listen and spy on us.. he can hear the people watching us talking through the hidden cameras. He has full blown conversations with no one. I‚Äôm freaking out! I too him why can‚Äôt I hear them? His response, is the voices don‚Äôt want me to hear them. He doesn‚Äôt know hes sick, he won‚Äôt go see a doctor.. and he gets mad when I tell him I‚Äôm worried about his mental health and this behavior is signs of schizophrenia.. He‚Äôs boarding up our house, taking down my decorations saying there‚Äôs hidden cameras on them through this new nano web technology the government has.. I‚Äôm scared for him.. this is so hard to watch him loose himself, his mind and he won‚Äôt listen to me. I‚Äôm fearful the bounces make him turn on me and hurt me or himself.. When we‚Äôre out in public he yells at random strangers saying they are a part of the neighborhood watch whose investigating and following us. These people are so confused when he does this, and it‚Äôs just getting worse. At times I see the man who I fell in love with still there, but those times are getting fewer by the day. I‚Äôm at a loss and need help. Has anyone ever dealt with something like this with a person you love or even yourself? What did you do to help get your love one on medication or even believe you that the voices are only inside his mind and not real? I‚Äôll take all the advice, hard truths, (I can handle hard truths, just don‚Äôt be rude) please send information on how to handle this situation. Personal experiences and tips, medications, therapy, that got you though this and saved your love one from a tragic situation. My boyfriend is suffering and I‚Äôm barley hanging on here, I need help to help him.

"Your story is eerily similar to what happened between myself and my partner last year.   


My partner had a history of substance abuse, but for 2 decades had been clean. He's always had a touch of paranoia, and some ideas of reference, but nothing I couldn't manage.   


Last year, things changed for the worse. He began having significant paranoia, to the point of not living his life in a meaningful way because he feels he is/was being hacked, followed, etc. I could go on and on about the auditory hallucinations, and the paranoia/delusions, but...there's no point.   


At any rate, I finally coaxed him into seeing a psychiatrist. I am not sure how well that is going because he still has these ideas and fixations, despite medication. But at least he's able to work.   


That said, he left me last August. In some ways it was abrupt, but in others...my heart knew what was coming. He'd distanced himself from me. I still don't understand it all. I don't know if I ever will.   


We work together, so that's tough, and we see each other often but as time goes on, and I have more time to myself, I'm realizing that even though I love him deeply, even if he wanted to reconcile tomorrow and move back into our home, I've come to cherish my peace of mind.   


If I had any suggestion at all, do some research into psychs in your area. I chose one and I don't think it was the right one, but at least he is seeing someone I guess. It wasn't easy getting him there, but somehow, he did. One of the things I remember telling him is that his anxiety was way high, and that wasn't good for him, and he needed someone to get meds to take the edge off.   


I tried to get his family involved to get him into some sort of care...but it didn't work for us. Maybe that might be an option for you, if he has family you can talk to 1:1. 

Now...the other side of things is more heart wrenching if he won't go alone. It sounds as if he's getting more volatile in his interactions. It may come to having a PEC (involuntary hold). My mother was schizophrenic, and so is my aunt, so I'm no stranger to those, either.   


If he won't willingly go for treatment, hospitalization may be the only option...particularly if he gets more volatile. I hope he doesn't, but if it happens, that will likely be the outcome, which could be beneficial. 

It is terrifying to watch the person you love descend into chaos. I kept telling myself...if I'm this stressed over the situation, imagine what's going on in HIS mind.

What I just don‚Äôt understand at all, is how others will come to me, say that their autistic, or have some extreme disorder that you would imagine probably makes their life very hard, and then right after talk about how they‚Äôve been in multiple relationships and are probably on their (say for example) fifth relationship. I just don‚Äôt get it in the slightest. I‚Äôve never been in a single relationship in my whole life and I‚Äôm 30. My anxiety is terrible, my BPD isn‚Äôt great either and as hard as it is that I haven‚Äôt been able to bond with someone like that, it is what it is. Yet others go on about the multiple relationships they‚Äôve been in despite their disorders or whatever.  I‚Äôm assuming many of us probably are constantly asking this question, and it‚Äôs funny how to this day, I haven‚Äôt heard an explanation that actually makes any amount of sense. So can someone just explain it to me? Because even though I may not have been in a relationship, I can at least confirm that the fact that I‚Äôve been emotionally unstable in addition to other difficulties like the bpd, it makes sense that finding a relationship for me would probably be pretty hard"	Ok_Anxiety4808	post	27.47174597499066	male	White	0.9980351328849792	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

It's difficult to give a concrete answer to this question as everyone's experiences and situations are unique. However, it is possible that those individuals who have been in multiple relationships despite their difficulties may have had more resources and support available to them, or they may have been lucky enough to meet individuals who were more understanding and accepting of their situation. It's important to remember that relationships and finding genuine connections with others can be a complex and challenging process, and it's okay to take things at your own pace and in your own way. It's important to prioritize your mental health and well-being above all else, and to seek out help and support when needed.

"When I was a teen, I grabbed the razer and went to bathroom/shower and was looking at it for one hour under the water. I was trying to feel something.

I don't know what it does feel like to be normal. All I know is that I don't want to be in this reality anymore. I don't remember the last time I felt real... never.

I'm sorry to hear that you've been going through such a difficult time. It's important to remember that the illusions we create in our minds about ourselves and our lives can be deceiving. It might not feel like it right now, but you are not alone and there are people you can talk to for help and support.

"I understand some of this a great deal.  In fact, i have been wondering what illusions I've not noticed in my life... ones that have been there a long time. Since i was a kid myself. 

Recovery and healing take so. Much. Energy.  And time.  No different than going to physical therapy to regain strength after an injury or illness. It doesn't happen overnight, but slowly.. things start changing for the better. 

But in the meantime, we can't see it because there's still so much pain.  And it seems like we'll never get there. 

I've been there and back again, to quote Tolkein. Nothing is static, and is always in flux... whether the things are good or bad. That's a hard lesson for me to learn. It all seems like such a gamble.

I feel like my life and/or happiness is just not important. I feel guilty whenever I feel happy where I am at. I feel guilty when I perceive things a different way because I get the feeling it‚Äôs wrong. One of my biggest things is that I just want to be kind to people. My biggest motivation is a quote. ‚ÄúYou can still be a kind and good-hearted person and still tell people when to f*ck off when necessary‚Äù. However, there are times where I just can‚Äôt be there for people because they are so far away. I couldn‚Äôt prevent something terrible from happening. I just want to love. I don‚Äôt want to hate, I don‚Äôt want to be shitty to people. We live in dark times, so it‚Äôs really important that we are all a little nicer each other.

"I‚Äôm apart of the LBGTQIA and work with those in my community. I love my job. Don‚Äôt want to work anywhere else. However the Nashville shooting has really shook me up. 

Yesterday my dad tried to call me and was very out of breath on the phone. I had not paid attention to the shooting all day as I was at work. From news reports the shooter was transgender. My dad is worried that some right wing nut case is going to come to our agency and harm myself/others. 

We got an email today on how to talk as staff, talk to clients that this is a gun problem combined with mental health issues. 

We have lock down procedures and when guns are brought in the facility it‚Äôs run fight hide protocol. My office is open cubicle so no places to hide. My agency lease let the security go a few months ago. I did not tell my dad this as it would have only increased the worry. 

I tried to tell him I could be shot at a grocery store but that didn‚Äôt work. He kept coming back to you are my only child and I don‚Äôt want to lose you. How do I maintain my love of advocacy and also maintain safety? 

I have no children or spouse and single so I have never really considered how important my safety is to my parents. I‚Äôm usually the first line of defense at work because I‚Äôm good at diffusing difficult clients. 

I have seriously considered moving out of the US so I don‚Äôt have that worry."	Economy_Arugula4527	post	30.524781358301546	female	White	0.025328300893306732	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

I share this worry with your Dad after seeing/hearing what some are saying about this person. I don't think moving out of the US would 'fix' the problem but I can absolutely understand the desire to do that. Having been heavily involved in creating an organized safe space for lbgtqia in my community, upon hearing these things lately made me very concerned for everyone's safety. More than usual. Dough heads have loud microphones these days and it's hard to know what will come of it. I wish I had something smarter and more valuable to say but I hear you. I understand your Dad's concern. I'd like to believe the general conversation about the real problems will be addressed but I just don't know. I do think your natural gift of being a diffuser is a wonderful thing that will help you identify any problems before they unfold.

I don‚Äôt know, I always find myself finding really toxic people or just people talk kinda nasty sometimes. I usually like hanging around a lot of chill and kind people. They‚Äôre just wonderful to have around, but sometimes there‚Äôs just too many people spouting hatred sometimes. Like ‚ÄúI hate this‚Äù or ‚ÄúI hate that‚Äù. It‚Äôs ok to hate something, but sometimes I think I consume to much of it and I forget to hear myself think. I forget how I perceive things. I really struggle with this.

I'm just so scared bc what if I wake up one morning and one of my other friends have texted me saying she's gone,  or whay if I'm in class and get a message,  ik then it would be my fault bc I knew that she was feeling like this and didn't help.

"Make sure you have sufficient medical records to show your treatment history, including any inpatient hospitalizations,  outpatient treatment, emergency room visits, etc.  The records must show your functional capacity, and your doctors must be willing to provide the records.  They usually go back two years. 

You will also be sent some forms to complete and return.  Those must be returned for your claim to be reviewed. 

If there aren't enough records, an exam will be ordered for you. If you do not attend the exam,  you may be denied. 

If you're not approved, you can file what's called a reconsideration.  If that is also denied, you can request an appeal with an administrative law judge.

The process timeline is dependent on how long it takes to get all of the records and information they need.  

The biggest key to the entire disability process is sufficient medical records.

"‚ö†Ô∏èPlease don't read this because if you think that it can be triggering for you.

Thinking about it all day. Finally decided to do it.

So I grabbed my knife. It wasn't sharp. Spending a little time to sharpening it while listening to my favourite playlist. I was so confident and happy about my decision. I wasn't trying to attempt suicide but to damage my hand. Holding it but I couldn't do it... I felt shame so I tried once again but still couldn't so my shame increased... Over and over but I still couldn't do it. I just accidentally scratchd my finger tip but I wasn't satisfied.

I have lost my senses through the day. I don't know what I'm feeling but it hurts a lot. I don't like my situation. 

Please I don't want any advice. I'm already damaged and suffering. I'm just breathing without being alive and no place to hide... just a cursed life. I prefer to be dead"		post	10.948087500677579	male	White	0.9981918931007385	na	na	na	7	MentalHealthIsland

"From one cursed person to another, start Dialectical Behavioural Therapy. Find a psychologist you can be completely honest with, without judgement. Learn to stop judging yourself by others' standards. If you keep comparing yourself to others, you'll always make yourself feel terrible.

If you can find a DBT group you can go to in person, it's even better. It might not make you feel amazing, but it'll make you feel a bit less terrible and stop you from making the situation worse. 

You can learn to regulate your emotions and impulses better.

"I think I'm suffering from some kind of compassion/empathy fatigue and I'm not sure what to do about it.

I've just felt this increasing aversion to any discussion from other people of emotions, relationship issues, life crises, etc. Now I know I'm supposed to be a caring, empathetic person who feels others' pain to some degree, but I just don't, and that doesn't seem normal. I'm trying to figure out what is happening with me and what I'm supposed to do about it.

*I just don't give a crap* about other peoples' issues anymore. I know that sounds selfish and uncaring, but those feelings are there, and I figured it's better to examine them rather than bottle them up. Friend's grandmother died - don't care. Another friend had to put her dog to sleep - don't care. My aunt has stage 4 cancer - don't care. Girlfriend found out a close relative might be terminally ill - don't care. I recite the empathetic words, make a facial expression that suggests concern, pat shoulders, and hand them tissues, but the genuine feeling is just not there. I look in the place where it's supposed to be, but it's missing. 404 Not Found.

When people start talking about these things, they just seem like the most loathsome, annoying, sickening topics imaginable. It's a physical sensation - my stomach knots up, my head starts to ache, and I would just do anything to *STOP* hearing it. When my girlfriend gets on her phone and starts talking about some drama with her friends, I have to put my headphones in or leave the room. Sometimes there are urges to tell her or other people to just shut up and stop bothering me with their problems. I have zero tolerance anymore for any movies/TV about interpersonal drama. All I'm really in the mood for is dumb comedy movies or nonfiction books.

The only time I'm relaxed and feeling ""normal"" is when I'm all alone and I can just exist without having to recite, ""I'm sorry to hear that"" or ""That must be hard for you"" (her extended family is rather tumultuous, so there are a lot of times I have to be a shoulder for her to cry on).

I recently spend a lot of time daydreaming about disengaging completely from all social life and just moving somewhere else; sending out letters to all my family and friends telling them, ""*It's not you, it's me, but we won't see each other anymore. I know you'll get over it with time. Be happy.*"" And just move a few states away and nip every relationship in the bud. Alfred Adler said ""all problems are interpersonal relationship problems"" - so no people, no problems, right? (I know that's not the point of Adlerian psychology, but my weary mind makes it so). My mood during this recent crisis has been emotionally dull or neutral, but I get choked up thinking about the days when I'd wake up and have literally no responsibilities or social obligations that day; when I could lose my phone and not even care about finding it since nobody calls it anyway. I literally get a lump in my throat thinking about it and want to cry. There's something incredibly beautiful about it. I could write passionate poetic odes to the joys of sitting on a (metaphorical) hillside, looking at all the drama, sorrow, rage, and anxiety in the little city below and being blissfully disconnected from all of it. I want to be up in my peaceful little homestead far, far away, and only glance occasionally at society and giggle at what a horrid mess it is. It sounds silly, but that's where I am right now.

Let me restate: My goal in life is to be a kind, helpful person. But these feelings of apathy (haha, kind of an oxymoron if you think about it) are there, and I can't just make them go away. The girlfriend knows something is wrong with me and is upset that I'm not spilling all the details to her. She doesn't believe my excuses that I'm just tired or have a headache. I just have no idea how to tell anyone about this, or if it's even a good idea to tell anyone. I'm just so sick of being needed, wanted, and depended on. All the philosophy and psychology I've read (which is a lot) harps on about how important relationships are, but that just doesn't seem to be good advice in my case. I've always been kind of an introvert, and I'm worried I've taken on more relationships than my emotional machinery can handle and now I've permanently broken something.

I read up on this and the main suggestion was self-care and taking some ""me"" time now and then. I occasionally get a ""me"" day as I've mentioned before, but it doesn't really recharge me; just kind of makes me long for every day to be like that. Other places online have advised me that I'm being a ""people pleaser"", but I'm not sure that's true. They already frequently call me a selfish person, which I don't really agree with (I'm not demanding that others do things for me that I'm not willing to reciprocate. I really don't ask much from other people at all; I just wish they'd be mindful about what they're asking from me).

I'd appreciate any advice or similar experiences. Is it fixable, or is this just part of who I am now?"	Old-Measurement-9801	post	26.233378187545377	male	White	0.9990912675857544	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

"I think this is a pretty normal reaction when we're bombarded with situations that we're expected to emphasize with.  To me it seems almost like a mechanism that our subconscious puts into place to shield ourselves from potential or ongoing pain. 

I'm very similar...i have a deep desire to help others- everyone who knows me I do as much as i possibly can.  But the well has been running dry because rarely are the same courtesies extended to me.  

I've had to back away from some of the emotional vampires in my life-- the ones who have come to expect a certain type of reaction from me without ever giving anything in return.  In setting up some boundaries,  I'm more able to extend appropriate empathy to others.  But it's become a matter of choosing my battles/ duties. 

Sometimes breaking away for a bit is needed to recharge.  I think about it quite a bit, also. 

I would be honest with your girlfriend and tell her you're quite possibly emotionally overwhelmed... because that's usually where these feelings come from.  Hopefully she'll understand.

"Recently i mentioned i was having trouble ""adulting"" due to lots of responsibilities in various ways. 

Today I've got to deal with a great amount of that kind of stuff and I'm already tired.  I've been doing things since about 7 am and it's barely 10 my time. 

I'm fine.. or as fine as i can be i guess. But i would be lying if i said i wasn't aggravated.  

I think of all the ways some of this could have been alleviated, or how i feel like i was sucker punched, basically.. left holding the bag with multiple situations i would have never chosen on my own, for myself, alone.

I feel a bit thrown to the wolves i guess.  Tricked and deceived.  And some of the people who could have helped avoid that reality  are just flapping around with no care in the world.  

I'm going to do everything i have to do, but if i were honest, I'm pretty angry about it."	mrsheartbroken	post	23.74141466742038	female	White	0.9984092116355896	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthIsland

"Coping with dark thoughts is not easy. Every time that happens it's like my first day. Nothing can change the phase. Listening to my favourite playlist, doing my hobbies... no. Nothing can change me when my brain turns off.

For me Coping with it is useless. Like how bleeding have pain as a consequence...so as well my unstable mind hurts when it enters the loop... and unpredictable.

I don't feel right and my brain is trying to trick me. Even though part of me knows self hate is absurd, the other part feels all the hate. At the same time I know that I'm not a monster and still I feel the demon. It seems jekyll is turning into hyde... not much control over it tho.

"It's so hard to pull out of the nosedive depression and self-hatred put us in! üò•ü´Ç

I would argue that your dark thoughts are based on a false image of you in a fun house mirror, dark and twisted in ways that you have never been. 

I really wish you could see yourself as we do. Sina is a really sweet guy. He's very kind and is responsive and comforting to others who are hurting.

Maybe you can look at that picture of yourself as a kid, and tell him you love him. Even if you can't look in the mirror and say it to yourself now. You deserve that love. I really believe that. 

Sometimes when I'm stuck in a loop, putting very cold water on my head for a moment can shock me out of it, if only for a moment.

You are not a bad person. Please don‚Äôt let your mind convince you otherwise. Life is beautiful, although it may not feel like it now, you can get better.

My family is always being unintentionally hurtful because they think mental health issues are just imaginary. I‚Äôm very hung up on my ex who has long moved on. I keep having vivid dreams about her. We were together for five years. She was the best friend I ever had and I just miss her. I‚Äôve tried dating again and I feel like it made things worse because I realized how good I had it in my last relationship. I‚Äôve been having suicidal thoughts. Everything feels meaningless. My ADHD is rampant, it is so hard to focus and be productive, and motivate myself. I‚Äôm not sleeping well. I have no appetite. I am out of my antidepressants and I can‚Äôt afford to go to a doctor.

You sound like a generous and loving person. I‚Äôm sorry you are struggling. I know when you are caring for others it can be easy to ignore your own needs. And many mental health struggles make motivation a challenge, especially if your energy is already spent on other things. Don‚Äôt feel bad about letting hygiene get away from you, but recognize your needs and that you deserve to have them met. Hygiene can be a very enjoyable part of self care. At my most depressed times I was unmotivated to shower, but a long, relaxing bubble bath felt easier and more rewarding. May or may not be true for you too. Maybe having somewhere to go can also be a good motivator. If that‚Äôs the case, try thinking of something you want to do or an out of the house errand and get ready for it. The important point is that you deserve some self care.	DamnedWeirdo	reply	na	na	na	0.9983435869216919	strong	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

And people say that giving up isn‚Äôt the best idea when it comes to things like this but I don‚Äôt feel like I have a choice this time. I think I‚Äôm just going to end up just like he did dead at 47 in a small rehabilitation center for people with ‚Äúproblems‚Äù I don‚Äôt want to be around me anymore I try my hardest to no be like him nor be me cuz both or horrible people.

You can't change anything that's already happened, none of it matters anymore in terms of who you are as a person. What matters is who you are tomorrow, the choices you make to become the person you want. If you focus on who you were you will never make it there"	FIN_1937	reply	na	na	na	0.9973969459533691	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
"Recognizing where you are and how you feel, is very powerful just by itself. Regardless of where you are now, where you would like to be, who you are, and who you would like to be - having self awareness and introspection as to what you are how is so unbelievably commendable.

Change takes time, habits take time, and healing takes time. I know how aggravating and hopeless it can feel to feel like you're failing yourself, or not doing good enough, or not being where / who you wish you were. But lingering on the feeling of dissatisfaction makes the healing and the growing much more difficult.

The most difficult thing I could possibly ask of you, is to forgive who you are and who you've been. Even just accepting it alone is a monumental task. But it's the second step to overcoming yourself and being who you want to be. The first step is realization, and you've already accomplished that :)

I'm proud of you Fin. You're always searching for a better tomorrow, and that's not something everyone has. I know you are going through a lot, and you've been through a lot, but you're still pursuing a better future. That's worthy of great praise. The road ahead is tough, because there's so much healing and hurting yet to go through, but after a certain point of healing, things stop hurting as much.

"Since I was a kid I‚Äôve always been told I‚Äôm like my father. Usually not a compliment in context. Anxious, pessimistic, judgmental, and unable to control my anger. I think he and I have both worked hard to overcome that part of ourselves. I‚Äôm still working on it. It‚Äôs ruined a lot of relationships. Hurt myself and the ones I love. However, the last few years I feel I‚Äôve made great progress. 

Some things that have really helped me are: 1. learning to recognize my feelings and talk about them. To some that may sound obvious, but a lot of my problem was that I wasn‚Äôt in touch with what I was feeling, who I was or who I wanted. Just thinking about it, and taking any opportunity I can to talk about it and evaluate what I wanted and how I felt out loud has helped me immensely. Therapy was good for this. 2. Learning to appreciate myself. Recognizing your shortcomings is important, but for me it was much harder to recognize my merits. It‚Äôs still hard for me, but when I recognize my good qualities I become more focused on letting those shine and my negative ones naturally become less prominent. I also feel more motivated to work on myself when I don‚Äôt hate myself. 3. You gotta be patient and forgiving with yourself, even if others aren‚Äôt. Change takes time. This post shows you‚Äôre trying. You‚Äôre moving in the right direction. Feel good about that. Take pride in your growth, and don‚Äôt beat yourself up when you mess up (in my experience other people will do that part for you). If there‚Äôs a bad habit that used to be daily, every day you refrain is a success. Recognize it and feel good about it. 

Reading my own advice, it sounds cheesy as hell. It‚Äôs gotta come from a place of sincerity, but it helped me, maybe it can help you. Don‚Äôt give up on yourself."	FIN_1937	reply	na	na	na	0.9973969459533691	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
"You need to forgive yourself and be kind to yourself. It‚Äôs good that you have this level of self awareness. You want to change and be better and you can. 
But please remember that nobody is perfect and change isn‚Äôt easy. It‚Äôs a difficult thing to come to terms with ourselves and then want to change our habits, but it‚Äôs also an incredibly brave and strong thing to do. So well done. I know it‚Äôs easy for me to say but please try and not be so hard on yourself. You can change, you can be better. It‚Äôs not an easy path, but you can do it, please be strong, please keep your head up. 

You sound like a really kind and understanding person. So please be kind to yourself and understand your situation. Have you tried therapy? It was very helpful for me.

It might be good for you go get away for a long weekend or even a week, take a vacation for yourself and get away from everyone who is talking about this situation and reminding you of it.

What is psychotherapy?

Psychotherapy is a form of treatment for mental health issues that involves talking to a trained mental health professional such as a licensed therapist, counselor, or psychologist. The aim of psychotherapy is to help individuals overcome emotional and psychological challenges, improve their mental health, and achieve personal growth and self-awareness.

In psychotherapy, individuals work with their therapist to explore their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and to develop strategies for managing difficult emotions, coping with stress, and improving their relationships. The therapist provides a safe and non-judgmental space where individuals can share their thoughts and experiences, and work towards positive change.

There are different types of psychotherapy, such as cognitive- **behavior**   therapy, psychodynamic therapy, humanistic therapy, and others, each with its own approach and techniques. The type of therapy that is most suitable for an individual will depend on their specific needs, preferences, and goals.

# There are many signs and symptoms that may indicate a need for therapy. Here are some common ones:

&#x200B;

1. Persistent      feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or anxiety that interfere with daily      life.
2. Difficulty      concentrating or making decisions, or frequent forgetfulness.
3. Changes      in appetite or sleep patterns, such as sleeping too much or too little, or      eating more or less than usual.
4. Intense      or frequent mood swings, or feeling easily overwhelmed.
5. Difficulty      managing stress, or feeling constantly on edge.
6. Avoiding      social situations, or withdrawing from friends  and family.
7. Struggling      with a traumatic event or experiencing flashbacks or nightmares.
8. Experiencing      relationship problems, including difficulty with communication or      intimacy.
9. Experiencing      a significant life change, such as a divorce or job loss, and having      difficulty adjusting.

If you or someone you know is experiencing any of these symptoms, it may be beneficial to seek the help of a mental health professional. A therapist can provide support, guidance, and tools to help manage and improve mental health.

I don‚Äôt know what is normal either. I think normalcy is largely a socially propagated myth. I used to be very private and secretive. I didn‚Äôt talk about personal matters at all. Not even to friends or family, and I was afraid to see a therapist. I was afraid of being judged or misunderstood. To be honest I still am, but I realized that being so secretive was stressful. I also realized that my secrets weren‚Äôt as shameful or shocking as I thought. Now I‚Äôm pretty much an open book. Try not to worry. If someone else is judging you, in the words of my therapist, ‚Äúf*** them.‚Äù (Idk if we can swear in this sub). Just try your best to be true to yourself and live in a way you feel proud of.

"Hello!  


First things first:   
Yup, I think I am dealing with depression but no, I am not looking to harm myself, I am not on that edge and I can sort of see where I should go. Why am I so tired? Well that's a different question.  


I am 33 years old. I am an immigrant. I immigrated from Mexico to Canada 5 years ago. When I moved in, I felt like I was living the dream. I always wanted to move to Canada, moved in with a good Salary, The support of my friends, My family and my GF.  


5 years later, I am running out on fumes. Holy shit, I am exhausted. And I come here to be honest about what was the biggest change. Of course, one of the reasons was the Pandemic, 100%. But the biggest reason is:  
My relationship ended.  


You might roll your eyes and be like ""Ohh, another broken heart"" but no, I spent 7 years with this person. We were VERY good friends before dating, we knew each other since I was 16 in Highschool. We were really close and until 2020, I didn't know what a Life without her was like. I forgot rather. Sure, she wasn't my GF from the get go, but she was my friend since Highschool. That's why since we broke up in 2020, has been a constant drag. Specially as it was for reasons out of my control!  


She lived in a different country because it was her dream to live there, and I fucking supported her! I was like Yeah! You go girl! And she did it! I was fucking proud of her moving to that country, although it was temporarily, I was so happy for her.  


And long story short, while in her country, she got sexually assaulted by a piece of shit. That broke havoc in our relationship but because she didn't tell me she was a victim, she blamed herself, and it wasn't until she talk with a therapist where she was able to tell me what happened. But things were wobbly until one day, she broke up with me. She came out of the closet and left me for her best female friend, who is also a victim of the same person.  


And here I am, three years later, 2 in complete isolation due the pandemic. Living in Canada, with not so many friends and working remote. I do have friends here mind you, I am not completely alone, I am actually known for being very social! Even in here. But the thing is, is super hard making friends as an Adult. And I couldn't ""Party out"" my break up as we were on a pandemic. I wouldn't go back with her, and I don't think I miss her, but I miss being cared for.   


I of course care about me, but man, I miss being hugged, just lying down on the couch with your partner watching whatever. The content didn't matter but the company. Just grabbing your jacket and walk outside with that person. When you had a bad day just one phone call away. Now, jesus, three years later being an immigrant, trying to survive, trying to make friends. And the worst for me is... I am terrified of being alone. I mean, of course there's somebody out there that I can be a partner with, I know that for a fact... but the chances of meeting any person is super hard in my current life, and I am fucking exhausted.  


I finished the Edgerunners series on Netflix, and man that shit hit like a truck, I felt so alone seeing how Lucy cared sooo much for David as... I did the same for one person. And it feels fucking terrible to be here, alone in the world. I am TIRED.   


I keep telling myself that I am lovable, and that I deserve care, but It is so hard to keep moving forward when your mental health is in shambles, you're tired, I don't love my current job (But it pays EXCEPTIONALLY well), I don't have as many friends as I had back home, I don't  have any family here, I am not at school so making friends is sooo hard, and honestly, I do want to meet people, but I am just too exhausted to ""start over"".  It doesn't help that I work remote. I always wanted to work fully remote but man, now I really need to go grab a coffee with people more often.   


I wanna meet a person to be able to be... me. Love and being loved, because I did loved in those 7 years, but it feels that perhaps I wasn't being loved. I don't know at this point. But I sure felt loved at the time. I don't know what to do. I knew I was tired in the past, but I assured me things would be better... and yet, here I am. I am just exhausted.  


I just want to be hugged."	porky_bot	post	28.691484982576995	male	White	0.9977236390113831	na	na	na	4	MentalHealthIsland
I can‚Äôt say much but I do think you burned out and any for of energy drinks can really help that I think you might need to seek professional advice to get better but when I‚Äôm feeling down in the dumps it normally helps to just slow down and think about you in the present time and ask yourself how do you think what will help you get better from this or listen to music until 1 AM it help it might seem ridiculous but if you have the time on your hands, you should probably try it you would be impressed by how much just listening to music that‚Äôs eternal in the dream/nostalgia genre can help or listen to a playlist about ‚Äúthe end‚Äù or something happy you will feel at least a little bit better this has always helped me and many other people do this because music helps I‚Äôm sure you can find many people talking about their fav songs on the subreddit	porky_bot	reply	na	na	na	0.9977236390113831	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
"Hey I think it‚Äôs totally normal to want to be loved and it seems like you have done some introspective work to figure out what you want. Loneliness is a powerful emotion and exhaustion can be a side effect. You know your body best. If you‚Äôre actually needing rest, honor your self love, epsom salt baths can work wonders. If it‚Äôs the depression creeping in, I encourage you to use a tool called Opposite to Emotion Action. Challenge the emotions by acting opposite of the feeling. For example when feeling low or down or isolated challenge the feeling by going for a walk or calling a friend. Little by little these shifts can help us find the balance. I believe when we are true to ourselves the ‚Äúright‚Äù person will be found. You are worthy and thank you for sharing. 

Ps. After recently reconnecting with an ex of 7 years only to find more toxicity, I can tell you that hug was not worth it. Continue to value and respect yourself is the lesson here."	porky_bot	reply	na	na	na	0.9977236390113831	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

"Hi people, I haven‚Äôt really opened up about this issue for a while. So here goes nothing. Every few months my behaviour around drinking gets really bad and my habit actually starts to feel uncontrollable. Which can be really scary.
I‚Äôve always had booze around me growing up and thought to myself things would calm down as I got older, well I‚Äôm in my mid/late30‚Äôs now and still I can‚Äôt seem to be able to stop drinking once I‚Äôve started. I‚Äôve had drinking pains for years, they‚Äôve recently got worse and now a pain in my chest due to smoking which kicks in whenever I drink as-well. I don‚Äôt really know what to do, I‚Äôm a really healthy guy outside of this habit but I feel my life is being destroyed by this drink, heal/rest, drink again habit, it‚Äôs ridiculous. 
I work from home and feel pretty isolated a lot of the time, I used to have really bad social anxiety, thankfully that has subsided though the habit remains.

"One of the most upsetting issues I have with both anxiety and depression is my limited ability to address symptoms for either of them. The result is that I'm anxious about the anxiety I know I'll face at work because I can't avoid it. 

All I can do is put my head down and endure it. I'm so tired of just living through adverse situations. I'm tired of knowing that even if my depression isn't at its worst now, another wave is coming. It's hard to enjoy the brighter moments fully.

I put in my two weeks notice at my current job. I work, for now, scheduling medical appointments at an incoming call center. My anxiety seems disproportionate for the actual stressors present. Yet our turnover is quite high despite great benefits, being part of a union, and good pay. That's even if you don't have a college degree.

I really like helping people meet their needs. I just can't handle the pace, the functional isolation. Even if someone else is reasonably close, I can't talk to them because it's too busy. There's never a break between calls during almost the whole week, except weekends, when I was alone with no one near me. 

I have an adjusted limited schedule of only two days a week, and I was still too anxious to make it in today. Mondays are the busiest days. I'm just sad. I got up in plenty of time, made lunch, ate breakfast, took my meds. 

Of course, that means I haven't been able to afford rent. So I have to break my lease. I'm moving in with friends this weekend and starting my new job at Target for $8 less an hour. 

I'll be doing general merchandising, which is stocking, price changes etc. I'll be *moving* though, which helps me deal with my anxiety. At my desk job I can't do anything.

So I'm working on life changes to preserve my mental health. I tried to work at my current job for six years and it's just gotten worse. 

I got divorced last July which just compounded my mental health issues, especially my depression. 

I never thought I was going to have to live through this. I've used suicidal ideation basically as a release valve. I've had a couple close calls over the last several years.

I still miss my former husband and the life we had. It was an amicable parting.

 I gave up the house we bought. I don't want or have the energy to take care of a house. 

 We bought a car together but I don't drive. 

So I gave it all up. It made sense for our dog to stay with my ex because there's a fenced in yard and he (my ex) works mostly from home. I didn't ask for anything. My ex is having trouble making the mortgage by himself and got a second job.

You'd think this was all new the way I'm going on about it. I came in with all these issues when Mental Health Island, in a previous incarnation, started. I'm just still grieving, still struggling.

At least now I'm making life changes instead of trying to change myself to fit into the life that doesn't work for me.

I'm just tired, and depressed, and anxious, and I'm weary of all three."	roanwolf75	post	35.63508388526745	female	White	0.9967203736305237	na	na	na	5	MentalHealthIsland

I was born and raised in a country other than my nationality because of a contract my dad had that alowed him to live in another country, at that time i was cheerful and talkative and could make friends with anyone to the point where i was friends with an entire grade, but then my dads contract span ended and we had to go back to our home country, at the time ive only ever visited there as a kid so i didnt know how the people their were like,and i only had one friend here but we couldnt hang out because we were too busy skrting our lives out, and at the same time the pandemic started and school was suspended, and when i finally went to school the class was basicaly if you put all the meangirls in a class, after i was done with that school year we transferred to yet another school and tried to make friends like i did before but i ended up being overly soially anxious and it didnt help that everyone knew eachother except me, i made friends with a girl that was sitting next to me until i realized that she had a bad personality and that she was toxic, the next day fater i relized that i moved seats from her and was seated between two childhood friends and we became really good friends, all the while my friend that came here from the other country and me were slowly drifting away because we were so far apart that we couldnt find common ground and now im scared that the two friends i made are going to abandon me because i feel like im butting inbetween them even though they did nothing to make me think so, i feel like a hypocrite thats just a shell of what she was before and my graded and social skills are both slipping away from me, and i feel like i will never become the honor student that i was before	No-Residentcurrently	post	9.261773767039356	female	White	0.9972623586654663	na	na	na	4	MentalHealthIsland

Breathe. I've been there. You just need to relax a bit, let go of the pressure. Yeah, you're in a new environment with new people, and I get that you miss your old home but it's gonna be fine. You just need to adjust. Your friends won't abandon you. They're your friends for a reason, if they didn't like you, you'd be able to tell. And it's okay if you and your old friend are drifting apart for now. There's no rule in life that you have to be someone's super close friend forever. You can still be friends but maybe you won't talk as often as you used to and that's okay. As long as there's no beef between you two then it's fine. Just take it one day at a time. Don't stress yourself worrying, just try to have a good day today. They go to bed and do the same tomorrow. Make fun memories with your friends, tell jokes and talk to new people as well.

"If it‚Äôs overwhelming you, one recommendation from a psychologist that helped me was cold water or ice packs. 

- Splashing cold water on your face.

- Ice pack on the face while leaning forward in a chair (think diver‚Äôs pose).

- Putting your face in a bowl or sink full of cold water and holding your breath as long as you can.

- Taking a quick, brisk, cold shower.

For me, the anxiety was reaching a level of overwhelm that breathing exercises, meditation, mindfulness, and physical exercise weren‚Äôt doing anything, so these were suggested as a way to kind of shock me out of it. They‚Äôve been incredibly effective in retraining my flight or fight responses, and the ice packs on the face while leaning forward in a chair helped me calm down waaay faster from a panic attack.

I have this friend with that I am not particularly close, but we are on friendly terms. So, we sometimes sit in class together and whatnot, but I have not attended classes twice and I am concerned that she may get annoyed, or she has found someone else to hang out with who would naturally push me aside. 

Am I overthinking this? But what if this does happen? What do I do to make myself feel that it is okay, so I won't feel so awful about it? And was this so-called friendship with her even worth it in the beginning? 

Does this happen to anyone else before? What's your story? 

I have gone through crap like this back when I was in public school and the emotional and mental trauma that resulted from it was torture. I always felt miserable being so anxious over whether they are upset over me due to this, but I don't want to put myself through that again how?

"I know... it affects me. I had my sleep on schedule before but the recent events didn't allow me to have a good sleep. But it's fine. I can change it slowly. Had a little dark thoughts at night but it didn't last long. Some self hatred and other usual stuff but it wasn't that bad. I mean can I get better in one night? Of course not. Still felt lonely (or alone... I don't know my English sucksüòí) but that's fine too. Pain is part of my journey. I'm not feeling strong yet but it doesn't hurt like last week. 

Also I had a small good conversation with someone which made me happy that moment.

I was supposed to go to see my psychiatrist but I didn't go because I was scared. It's really hard to go there. But it's ok at least I tried to think about going there. I need to change my medicines. 

Overall I'm sad but not too much. Like 4/10. That's good. I mean it was 9/10 last week so I'm still satisfied ."		post	19.30161742477996	male	White	0.007683080621063709	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthIsland

"Hey, everyone so I(17) have been in hot water so many times due to severe ADHD (but can't get diagnosed or even get help(thank you momma and papa) so I have decided to fuck it and self-medicate. I am 90% sure I have ADHD as these are my symptoms: A) I can't concentrate on anything, I have to tie myself up to even read my favorite books. I can't even do things I like for an hour straight. Since childhood, I have procrastinated until the last minute. Nothing, nothing has helped me be productive. I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING. B) When I get these periods of hyper-fixation, I just cannot think about anything else, and I only wish to do those things I'm currently hyper-fixated on. C) I tend to forget things all the time and there are many more symptoms but I'm getting too tired to list them all. So I cannot access therapy thanks to my parents and live in a country where mental health is taboo so what can I do to get out of this dilemma?

I have to do something because I have a test in two days and I haven't even touched my books and can't get myself to touch them. I just can't get myself to do anything, except pace around the room. Please help. So do I self-medicate? If so which one would be better Concentra or Modalert (the only ones available without a prescription)?"

This shit has been rough. I have felt so alone and so isolated for the last 6 years of my life. I try so hard to make friends and put myself out there and I just get left on read, or they‚Äôre busy. I‚Äôm starting think it‚Äôs me maybe? I know I talk to much and that can be annoying but I just get excited to talk to people as most of the time I‚Äôm at work and most of what‚Äôs discussed is work related. I‚Äôve tried making friends with my coworkers but none of them seem interested. They all enjoy working with me I just don‚Äôt get it. I feel like I‚Äôm riding through life solo and I have 0 support system or anyone to cut loose and go fishing or camping or 4x4 with. Shit I don‚Äôt even have a number in my phone to call to see if they would even want to just get a beer. I wake up at 4:30am go to work and then I‚Äôm off at 7-8pm where I come home to an empty house. The weekends I just go do things by myself or I sit at home all day and tinker with shit In my garage. Work makes dating hard so I‚Äôve kinda given up on that. I don‚Äôt even care about having a girlfriend right now. I just want a friend. Im just tired of being alone. Im tired of doing things by myself. Im about to turn 28 and this will be my 7th year spending my birthday alone. I didn‚Äôt expect writing this to tear me up so bad. I‚Äôm just at a loss and I‚Äôm worried if things don‚Äôt change I‚Äôm not going to make it to 30. I don‚Äôt know how much more loneliness I can take	EfficientAd5781	post	19.94114628977339	male	White	0.9974629878997803	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

I need to remember that I will someday die

The very absence of my being

I feel like a russian doll inside a russian doll  inside a blank canvas

No one loves me the way I pretend to love my self

I just read a post from someone i love, so i wrote this...

Oh my sweetheart.  If you could only see yourself as i see you...

You would see that every aspect of the presence of your being-- your dreams,  aspirations, the depths of your very soul

Transcend any frailty of mortality.

The fact that you exist, in the vastness of the chaos of the universe... and that you are not only sentient but intuitive, insightful, and courageous...

And that i have met you even across oceans... is miraculous. 

Just as you are miraculous. 

I press my lips together as i reflect on your grief,  and your longing, as if i were pressing them against your forehead to show you i understand,  and you're not alone.  

We are all layers upon layers... and inside is not emptiness, but rather the cosmic dust that we all come from.

We all seek out our own value, pretending that the world doesn't assign value to us, whether it's being good enough at that job interview, or having a credit score good enough to buy that house-- i wish it wasn't so,  but the world is designed differently...

But the universe is not. 

In the timelessness of the eternity of the cosmos, what is the chance we would both exist? And you and i would come to know each other?

You never bore me, darling.  Because when the layers fall away,  in you i see myself,  and all of that brilliant,  shimmering stardust,  and i feel... safe, inside.  

It is, rather, hello again...i have missed you so. ‚ù§Ô∏è"	SafeInside6750	reply	na	na	na	0.9951991438865662	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

Please consider that maybe, this if us who care about you may be seeing you differently for a reason. You didn't trick us into seeing the beauty of who you are.

" I always held onto a belief that if you are nice to others naturally they would be nice to you as well but somehow they took it the opposite way. They push our feelings around thinking that we will condone it because nice people are forgiving and are afraid of confrontations. They have a point I do not like confrontations but that doesnt mean I think the way they do things are right cos they arent.

At this point I want to put a boundary of being nice and respectful for myself as that is what I believe in instead of thinking that it will please others.

Am i blowing this way out of proportion?

"as with many things in life. being nice is a good quality, up until it starts to encroaches on others areas of your life or sense of self.  if a 'friend' is using or manipulating your 'nice' personality then they are not a friend. they are using you.

a real friend will appreciate things you do for them, return some of that in acts or words of appreciation. 

if you are nice and kind because you feel its the right thing to do, thats about your beliefs, self worth, sense of self.  if you do nice things to garner favor in others - then your actions are more focused on external manipulation rather than internal beliefs."

‚ö†Ô∏è   TRIGGER WARNING  ‚ö†Ô∏è  

Life is just so hard rn. I'm trying to fight so hard but it's slowly getting harder. 

I have separation issues and anxiety and depression.  I struggle with self harm and suicidal thoughts.  

February 24 u think it was, I was taken away from my home. The home with eh family j love and √æhe family I have always been in. And it's my brother's fault.  It's his fault that I'm sitting here alone in the middle.of the night crying, bc I am worried that I won't be able to see them again. And I don't like to blame people unless I absolutely have to, but this is all his fault. Worse thing is, I'm being treated like a baby. A fucking baby. No body wants to tell me things even after I ask so many times.

I was sent to live with my sister but she left for vacation for almost a month and I'm alone. When she left she took something in my with her.  And this is very weird but I have gotten to know her more over the past few weeks and so she left and I'm having trouble coping with it. I came home last Monday and she had already left. I didn't get to say bye to her. But we call, but like there is no point t to these calls. I just listen to the background noise and conversation. 

Relapsed from sh again. Idk why I can't stop. Its stupid. I've had panic attacks more frequently then ever.  They haven't been bad but I'm afraid they will. But I can't trust anyone. J can't tell anyone this. I have to pretend like I'm fine. Bc thats what I am to everyone.  I'm fine. I act normal. Help everyone when they need it.

But I can slowly tell that I'm not helping them.  Just with how j respond to them. I know I've gotta get my shit together before Monday bc school startes up again then and between my homework, helping g my friends with there homework and shit, ik that people are gonna need my help. But like I wish that they would go to someone else, yk?

Everything is getting on my nerves lately and I just don't know how to like be around people qhenni feel like I'm gonna snap at them. I try so hard not to, like I don't wanna make them feel worse about 

I just- i know that if I can't go home. I'm  not living here no more. There will be know reason to live here ko more. I don't have my family to make me smile, I sont have my mum to hug me, j don't have my sister tk sit with me, at the kitchen table every night for hours, I don't have my oldest nephew to bug or the second nephew to play video games with or to talk to anymore.  I don't have my nieces laugh or her putting makeup and nail polish on me. I don't have my dogs. I don't have anything anymore.there is no reason to live.

Anyways, I could gonk  for hours and hours but if anyone read this, I'd  wasting there time, and if anyone did, I apologize for this stupidly long post about my life.

Also hope everyone is having a good day/ night! Stay safe ‚ù§"	MikeWheeler10	post	25.709892717550854	female	White	0.998390793800354	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

"It's been strong the past few days. 

I've noticed it happens after what i perceive as a ""slight. "" for example, there was an important meeting earlier this week and due to time constraints i didn't have the chance to speak, and i had been preparing for two weeks. 

I also feel slighted when i message someone and they don't message back... but when they're in need I'm the one they message. 

Lastly... weird dreams involving the need for immediate evacuation and my partner's family's displeasure in knowing i had to evacuate alongside them. in the dream they were downright mean. 

It's funny how all of that piles up until your brain tricks you by saying ""see? You're not what you think you are. You're insignificant.  The ones who don't know you well don't know any better yet.""

Just exploring the weirdness of these feelings, which seem to trump everything i know about my accomplishments and myself."	mrsheartbroken	post	19.758873807198032	female	White	0.005325353238731623	na	na	na	4	MentalHealthIsland

Staying clean is hard when you have so much going on, and you feel like you've lost your support system and you're overwhelmed. It's already an acheivement that you've been clean for 10 days, congrats.

I hope you manage to stay strong, cause it will get better, it will get easier in time.

"A classmate whom I sat with for 6 classes at the back of the class said that she should be sitting in the front. Her reasons are that a friend of hers is persistently telling her to join him at the front and that she believes that she can focus better on the front which I feel it could have been the same if it were at the back because it is not that far from the lecturer, the room isn't that big. 

But I was super polite and totally fine with her leaving me dry at the back while she goes off with the others when I knew she wants to be much closer to them than she ever was with me. 

This crap of people who I am SOOO awfully nice with just loves it to leave me out once they find a better and cooler crowd to be with. I thought this would be over when I am in my postgraduates but a situation like this is rising again. 

I refuse to think that I am boring or that I would be a loner without her because frankly, I didn't find her that interesting either. I just sat with her cos it started off that way. I may be acting irrationally but I went through a bunch of this melodrama in the past that it is giving me trauma at this point. and the potential of it happening again is giving me so much anxiety and if it really does happen. How can I overcome this so I won't be bothered by it, and I can go off on my own? 

But I hate the anxiety of now that I am sitting alone. Will people judge me? Although I really don't mind being alone, as an introvert I enjoy my own company but for one with social anxiety, the fear of judgment from others begs to differ. 

I know this isn't really an introverted sort of thing although it does play a part a little. This is more of social anxiety, and I could really use some support. 

I am left with 4 classes. What should I do? How do I overcome this? To make me feel that it's okay."	Oddlawstudent	post	24.88131293419127	female	White	0.9982060194015503	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

It is very difficult to not fear judgment by others but you should remember that it is not in the interest of everyone to judge specifically you. The most important of all, however, is to remember that, ultimately, you decide who you get judged by (this is why we have the concepts of idols, villains, and heroes). It is important to determine what kind of person you want to be, with certain morals and goals. As for social anxiety, I think it's more of a case of a certain fear of loneliness, the events that repeated multiple times have led you to a fear of being alone. It is very difficult to get out of this as an introvert, and I'd really recommend taking up a team sport or meet someone on an app and become gym buddies	Oddlawstudent	reply	na	na	na	0.9982060194015503	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
"So I had lots of ups and downs recently, making me exhausted and most of the time hopeless. But I learned that it's not permanent... well, nothing is permanent. And being patient is really hard same as self love... it all takes time. 

I'm satisfied that I didn't gave up my last tiny hope. So right now I believe things will get stable eventually, but danger is always in my way... dark thoughts will always come back. But my mindset will also get stronger over time.

I'm still not functioning and it's ok. My situation is just on hard mode so I believe I can find a way to adapt myself. At least I don't hate myself that much, and I want to show some love to myself that I never did before."		post	13.44597753415038	female	White	0.004890624433755875	na	na	na	4	MentalHealthIsland

"Idk why but over the past few months my thoughts have started to become pretty violent. Anytime I'd see someone doing something I don't agree with or doing something wrong I'd start to imagine hurting or killing them. Like if I see a person driving bad or something, I'd imagine driving up next to them and attacking them and stuff. I would go into detail more about it but I don't wanna say anything too bad that'll affect anyone reading or get me banned from this sub. 

It's weird tho because I'd also get angry at people who do the same actions as me, like if I was to do something the same way or matter that they'd do I'd still get mad at them. And I'm kinda scared because I'd just be in public and I see someone and I'll be imagining to myself ""I wonder what'll happen if do this or that to them"". I don't want to sound like a freak or insane or anything but it's not so bad but it's definitely getting more prevalent  the last few months. I'm scared that if it does get worse then I might eventually hurt or kill someone if it does happen more and more.

I also have been having these conversations with a fake voice in my head. I'd imagine another person's voice and I'd have conversations about stuff like football, Minecraft, music, or other topics with them, and sometimes also about mental health stuff. Sometimes in my head, sometimes talking out loud. But it's not really that serious, but just like all the thoughts I've been having, it's also getting a bit more prevalent. But I keep writing the convos off because I keep accusing myself of forcing myself to have these conversations just to convince myself of being a freak and making me feel worse about myself. Idk it just feels really weird.

"It sounds like you're dealing with some pretty serious anger issues. So the question is, do you feel scared, hurt, or vulnerable? Those are often underlying causes that may bring thoughts of violence to mind.

Violent thoughts sometimes give people a sense of control over a situation where they lack it. Unfortunately, acts of violence work in much the same way. That said, the thought and the act are very different things.

These sound like issues to go over with a healthcare professional. If you don't have a therapist, it's worthwhile talking to a primary care provider. This can be a family practice or internal medicine doctor, nurse practitioner, or physician's assistant. 

In my experience, physical activity helps lessen the feelings that can lead to vengeful ideation. While exercise isn't a substitute for any medical or mental health treatment, it can be an important tool.

I hope you can find peace in your future."	sticks_04	reply	na	na	na	0.9986438155174255	no	no	strong	na	MentalHealthIsland

"I've seen a lot of posts lately about self-harm, so I wanted to share a brief version of my 20+ year history with it.

I started cutting at age 14. I won't get into all of the details as to why, but I will say I didn't know what else to do...and it just felt like the thing to do. It continued to feel like the thing to do off and on until I was in my thirties.

Ending self-harm wasn't a linear process. People often describe feeling like a failure, or with less worth, when they self-harm after a period of not harming. **BUT THIS COULD NOT BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH.**

We are NOT failures when big feelings and emotions are reactivated. I do not like the word ""relapse"" because it has such negative connotations with it. I feel like ""activation"" is a far better word because it describes what has happened in our brain--we've been called to action in a way that is familiar and provides instant relief.

My experience is that self-harm began when I had no coping mechanisms in place. As time moved on, and I got therapy and developed better coping strategies, my cutting decreased. I feel strongly it decreased organically, naturally, because new neuropathways formed as I practiced things I learned in therapy. For me, cutting wasn't the issue itself, as much as it was a manifestation of my negative self-worth, my inability to regulate my emotions, and my frustration with how people treated me in day-to-day life.

As I learned how to better view myself, regulate my emotions, and weed out the people in my life who no longer served me any positive purposes, the urge to harm myself decreased.

I'm not perfect-I still have a fairly low self worth, and am treated for PTSD/anxiety/depression, and get frustrated easily. And I will not say the urge to cut ever went completely away. But I am 45 years old, and I haven't seriously cut since I was...32 maybe?

Anyway, my point in writing this is to let anyone who struggles with self-harm know you are not alone. And stopping self-harm doesn't happen overnight. It finally comes as you are able to develop more coping strategies and learn to be patient with yourself and honest with yourself about your feelings. If you go a period of time without self-harm, and it surfaces again, **YOU ARE NOT A FAILURE.** This kind of coping mechanism is embedded deeply in our psyche as a quick fix to whatever has activated our emotions. It isn't a linear healing process; in my case, I sometimes went years without cutting, then encountered something I couldn't deal with, and went right for the razor.

Give yourself some grace. Take a moment to breathe, and really think about what has activated your need to do this. And maybe, over time, you'll be able to manage those reoccurring activations a little easier.

Much love."	mrsheartbroken	post	30.713622172972233	female	White	0.0016872830456122756	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

"I've had a few hospital stays in my life due to mental health. I absolutely hated almost everything about them. Lately though I've been feeling very alone at night and realize there's one thing I really miss from being there. When nights really sucked nothing was better than having the someone stopping by, even when your half asleep or passed out, just to check on you. It is like your own mental grounding check. I miss that. I miss the nurses asking if I'm okay and me say yes even though they knew it was a lie. They'd always smile back.  It was minor stuff but it just made me feel connected and grounded.

I hated most hospital stays but damn if the nurses,techs, staff (whatever your title may be) didn't make it so much better. I guess in a way this is actually a thank you letter to the nurses that do it everyday.

"A few days ago I was triggered by something and made me feel so lonely and unwanted. It was so bad that I was nearly wanted to do something wrong to myself. 

That night before sleep I was holding my own hand and talking to myself to not feel alone... trying somehow to pass the moment. 

I'm getting better but I'm still sad, but it's not severe like before.

It seems I can't catch a break... everytime something horrible needs to happen to me to crush my soul... But it's gonna be ok."		post	14.657649131790581	female	White	0.025814007967710495	na	na	na	7	MentalHealthIsland

As some people might have seen in my last post about bad things I‚Äôve done. I started to think I owe it too the world to not be around anyone anymore as to not disturb them or hurt there reputations by associating with me in anyway whatsoever. I‚Äôve also been slightly scarred of people knowing my history. Even though I feel selfish for putting thought into that. I just don‚Äôt want to lose people I‚Äôve already lost so many and I feel like what‚Äôs the point in trying to rebuild anything for any reason. I‚Äôve hurt so many people and I want to be good and help people but I think it‚Äôs too late for all that. So what should I do?

"I've been where you are now. I've hurt others and caused harm. I shut myself away so my darkness couldn't infect anyone else. I thought ""no one cares so I might as well go away, it's what's best for them"". I took time, decided to work on myself even though I believed I'd never succeed. I've been on that journey for a while now and I can say with all honesty that it's worth it. People benefit from who we are today and with everyday that passes my life enriches theirs with my growth which in turn enriches mine. It's hard and some days I want to just quit but there's a light at the end of the tunnel and with each step I take to grow and be the person I can respect and believe in I get alittle closer to that light. You can get there too friend. Hiding away only robs the world of the person you could become.

"Many years ago, I watched the Robin Williams movie ""What dreams may come"", and I  always thought that in part, it was saying heaven will be whatever you want it to be - that each person's heaven is a manifestation of their own imagination. At least this is what I think. 

I think about that often. My idea of heaven is a small cottage in the countryside, near a lake with no other houses around. I have my cats and dogs. There are no mosquitos, spiders or moths (the things I don't like). It rains every night from 6pm to 6am. 

There is no stress, no noise. Just peace. Silence. Stillness. I am not being pulled in multiple directions as a mother, wife, friend, pet owner and employee. 

Sometimes, when my heart and soul ache I feel like I could walk away from it all. Not death, just walk away and become an anonymous nobody.. 

Sometimes I wish someone could just wipe away part of my brain / memories, so I am not tortured anymore by my past, so that everything I do is not because of the abuse I suffered as the adopted child of a woman with untreated mental health issues..  

But in the end, I am always alone and no-one is coming to save me."	Tattoosnscars	post	41.855877046288526	female	White	0.0027539567090570927	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

"I hate to say this... but i don't think a lot of parents understand, or want to understand.  And sometimes, i don't think it's because they don't care...i think it's because they don't know what to say, or how to react, so their response is dismissive at best,  inflammatory at worst. 

Of course, that doesn't absolve her from responsibility of hearing you out and listening, and helping you through this.  I guess what I'm saying is that her reaction is reflective of her own issues and inability to be what you need, rather than a reflection of you, or who you are or your value as a person. 

When i was growing up, i know my grandparents loved me. But they weren't emotionally available.  As I've aged, i know a great deal of it was due to their health issues, my mom and aunt's mental issues and ongoing drama, and lots of other circumstances.  I don't think they meant to emotionally starve me...i just don't think they knew how to interact with me in a way i needed.  That's when i turned to self harm.  And they knew... there was no way not to know.  Still, nothing changed,  and my cuts were never mentioned or discussed.

"I like to think that when someone close to me rejects me and my pain, it's because they're going through their own pain, but haven't found the strength to express it and begin healing. I've opened up to friends before in my life, and they've laughed and ridiculed me, and called me weak. It hurt a lot, and I always wondered why they would approach my vulnerability with such animosity, it seemed unreasonable and in very poor taste. But those same friends, much later in life, have started to introspect and shared with me that they were going through the same things.   


I don't mean to suggest your mother understands what you're going through, or is going through any of the same things herself. All I mean to say, is to accept someone else's vulnerability, you have to be vulnerable yourself. Being honest, genuine, vulnerable and open with people is unbelievably terrifying, and leaves you open to so much pain. Though, in my opinion, being vulnerable and open about yourself is incredibly powerful, and very much worthy of respect. It's a way of accepting yourself, even if just a little. And self-acceptance is something worthy of great respect, and a gigantic milestone for anyone struggling with mental health.  


I'm sorry your family hasn't been validating, accepting, or supportive to you Sina. Fighting these kinds of fights alone and isolated only make them more difficult. But I'm so very proud of you for reaching out to her, reaching out to us, and always working towards a better future. You always inspire me to continue to accept/forgive myself, and keep becoming my best self :)

"I generally don't like this part because I know reddit is also extremely toxic sometimes, but reaching out in 7cups(dotcom) was worse. I have been on the path to get an expungement (no drugs/violence) and often times I don't get anywhere or feel like I am just going to get denied and this sucks because I was falsely accused. I am also trying to fill the SO gap that has been 20 + years and not a single non-crazy date that could last. I had hopes because college has plenty people to meet. I met this girl last week that I had been trying to meet for the past month but couldn't find time to jump into a conversation. I have heard her say to the other guys hitting on her that she likes Harry Potter, and has said other things that just impress me greatly. Her positivity when I met her was amazing but I feel like  I got a look of dropped interest when I asked what class she was in. There wasn't enough time to talk but I may have forced 1 question and that something wasn't received well? I at least want to be her friend because she's extremely intelligent, but I am also about ready to call dating life a complete joke and quit. I over analyze but sometimes I am right. I am kind of dependent for a relationship but acting like it's going to happen one day doesn't help either.

Someone I went to high school with died and he was younger than me at age 22, while I'm 26. I regret not having a conversation with him that I should've had. I know we had only had one issue, but after high school we didn't have any, yet we didn't apologize to each other. We were cool after high school and learned we have similar interests, but I still feel guilty.

"I'm so sorry! So many bad things happen that just don't make sense. My mother was killed in a car accident when she was 22. I was just a baby. I've never understood why. She had so much life ahead of her, and I know she wanted to spend it with me. 
Let me ask you this: do you think that conversation you wanted to have with him would have changed anything? 
Many times actions speak louder than words . You said you got back in contact with each other and things were okay, correct? That's what's important!  You could have not done that and left things as they were. Sounds like you both had a mutual understanding by your actions that things were now much better between you.
When and if you can, visit his eternal resting place. Tell him ALL the things you wanted to say, and then some. I believe he will hear you. 
Some people go in and out of our lives because time, distance, and disagreements separate us. You might have more regret if you'd never got back in touch before he died.
Sorry that was so long, but some things to think about. I have 55 years under my belt, and it's based off of things I've seen others do and taken part in myself.

Were I work I‚Äôm the villain in the black hat. Working with people who mental health problems when you have them also just sucks. You come in thinking you can help but yeah thats bs. What actually happens is everyone treats you like poo because you refuse to let them violate your boundaries of play favorites.

"Depression is depression...don't misunderstand me. But there is a marked difference between how depression felt, and how I reacted to it, when I was in my 20s versus my 40s.   


I'm not sure that I'll explain it well. In my 20s, I didn't know how to manage my emotions. I cut regularly, my arms mostly (the gnarly scars are now covered with the maple leaf tats that I've shown you guys previously). I started counseling in my mid/late 20s, and learned different ways of coping with the constant feelings of desperation, abandonment, etc. Until counseling, I couldn't work very well, had difficulty focusing and interacting with others. I was in a constant vice-like grip of a black cloud...or something. 

In my 40s, it's different. There's almost a silent resignation now. I know I'm depressed, but I'm largely able to function. I go to work, do the things, come home, do the things I have to do to take care of myself. But there's always this...feeling. Kind of like an annoying mosquito that you can't kill and it keeps circling you. The feeling has become ""I'm 45 years old. The opportunities to do so much is past, and the relationships I tried so hard to build have failed."" That's usually followed with a list of things I didn't get to do. It could be as vapid as wishing I knew what it was like be young and vibrant in a big floofy cupcake dress walking down the aisle for my wedding, or as mournful as wishing I had had a chance to reconcile with my grandparents and my mother before they died, and have seen them as human beings, and interacted with them as adults, away from their parent roles.   


Then, in my 40s, the resignation follows: this is my life. I don't have anything to look forward to in the immediate future. No family to speak of for support...just years and years ahead of me in solitude. And I get scared.   


There also seems to be some sort of stigma after a certain age with depression,  I'm not sure if it's isolated to being female or if everyone experiences this. But it's almost like...I'm not young anymore and should have figured out my shit by now, and my experiences and feelings aren't as important as they used to be.  I'm worth even less than I used to be worth, because I'm aging.   


I know a lot of these thoughts and insights are colored by the depression--I know they're skewed and not entirely accurate. That's why I'm in counseling; I have a great analytical brain, but it often takes information that is not factual and draws what it thinks are factual conclusions.   


Whatever I'm trying to say, it boils down to this: the mechanism of depression is always the same, but the way you interpret it seems to change. Or at least, it has for me. Maybe it's the meds that has made the hopelessness more bearable, or maybe it's my aged indifference...I don't know."	mrsheartbroken	post	31.997405258067595	female	White	0.9553870558738708	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

"I know you've dealt with depression and other mental health issues for a long time. It *is* heartbreaking and I tear up every time I read or hear about it. 

I feel the expectation, internal or external, that I should have my shit together by now too. The pressure feels greater as I age.

It might seem like your value has decreased now that you're middle aged, and that's youth obsessed culture for you. Your experience in life and passion for helping others only enhances how greatly you can impact others positively.

You have opportunities that you didn't before, even if you don't want them. As you go about the long painful, process of learning to love yourself, people will only gravitate towards you more.

i don‚Äòt even know how to explain this, but i think i need help from you guys. yesterday i sort of attempted suicide, but not really. i had everything prepared: the suicide notes, the pills, my last will, a list of people that i want to be informed etc. after i had taken maybe 10 pills i needed more water, went to the kitchen and all of a sudden i thought: no. no, this doesn‚Äòt feel right. this just isn‚Äôt it. just the change of rooms kind of kicked me out of my wish to die if you know what i mean. luckily i hadn‚Äôt taken that many pills, so i just kind of slept through the day and felt a bit hungover. long story short: i discontinued my own suicide attempt‚Ä¶don‚Äòt know how i feel tbh. part of me is embarrassed, part of me is relieved that i‚Äòm still here and part of me wants to try again and pull through the next time. i don‚Äòt know if I want to even talk about this to my psychiatrist or therapist, because i‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äòs a story worth telling and i feel embarrassed about it‚Ä¶it feels like i can‚Äòt even get my own suicide right, you know. feels like I failed‚Ä¶	thinskinned_xi	post	17.669259799082397	female	White	0.050224266946315765	na	na	na	7	MentalHealthIsland

"You made the right call by stopping yourself it's called will power, your consciousness kicked in. No shame in sharing it with others that can relate and understand (that's been there before). 

I've have a situation like this back in 2010-2011 when I took 3-4 bottles of medication an downed it, going for 5th started hallucinating an mom an aunt freaked out first they thought I was being me or weird then they started to noticed when I ran out my room an almost out the house. Instantly it was hospital for me besides the hallucinating,seizuring ventilating and Poisoned to the core. Pumping out my stomach on the hospital bed out for two days straight woke up in the hospital bed wondering how I got there. With mom next to me. Bloated stomach and everything make all that meds & poisonous chemicals out of my stomach.  I had other episodes after up to the duration of 2015 then I had to wake up.That was one of the very first episodes for me to support, this matter will be complicated to share with friends not many know what to think of it. 

Therapy isn't bad if you feel unsafe they will send help for you right away without you knowing or knowing. Every life is valuable. We all have a part to play in life not everyone is going to be your friend choose your battles and relationships wisely (we only live once). Anyone dealing with mental health should be treated lightly because we came from a different environment,settings from others..life sometimes or people will get the Best of us. 

Keep fighting friends and use that as strength and fuel for what's to come. Don't be ashamed everyone has been through something embarrassing in their life we're only human after all.

Keep fighting stay strong stay positive that will help bring a more positive crowd. Going to sessions like groups for cognitive and cognitive behaviors and how to deal with it.

That's a good way of thinking in my opinion. Yes, a lot of shitty things happen in the world and people can be horrible but people can also be kind and most people have both sides. There is no black-and-white, we just like to assume that sometimes because it's easier to understand then the complex nature of things, how they actually are. In any case, the world won't get any better if we all think that everyone else is horrible. We have to acknowledge the positive sides of people and bring attention to them and share the love.

I feel that, kinda different for me. Ruined my engagement cause I took so long to try to get married for no actually reason just pushed it off. While everyone I knew what getting married and engaged faster. Lost her (8 year relationship), now I've seen she's talking to peoples. ( Happy? Idk) but I hate that I failed and looking back on my old buddies that made it and their happily married or working through their troubles with their partners. I'm happy for them, I envy them. I hate them for it but maybe it's my own faults/shortcomings , being the reason I feel like this. Not to take away from your post and stuff this is your time. But know one else feels you if that helps . My situation is mostly my own fault kinda I guess but still.

"Happened to me this week.  A couple at work had a wedding shower, which sent me into a spiral of all kinds of emotions: sadness, bitterness, anger... and the ""almost human"" feeling i previously described,  as i realized i have come so close to the human experience,  but never fully.  And i never will. 

I start EMDR next week to try to ""Rearrange"" my thoughts so that they're not always taking over, basically. But in the meantime... it has been bad.  I told my counselor it isn't as if I'm not happy for people when good things happen, but i also get angry, bitter, and depressed.  She assured me it's possible to feel both. 

One of the silliest,  but biggest issues i have is that when people get married or have a baby or some kind of celebration (or even loss), at work there is always a party or donation or something.  I give to all of them, but there's nothing going on in my life where I'll ever be able to experience the same.  Even when my grandmother died, or i graduated, or was promoted, there was nothing.

"I am not a doctor or therapist and this is all based on my own personal experience with CBT. Basically the way I would describe it is like you‚Äôre re-wiring your brain. Your therapist is most likely going to have your do some worksheets where you write down your thoughts and then re-frame them. You essentially learn to acknowledge your thoughts and then try to restructure them. Therapists can do this by asking questions to dig a little deeper and then help you think of a more helpful or supportive thought. 

I‚Äôm a bit weird but I would write notes during my therapy sessions of things that came up or things my therapist said. I also asked for ‚Äúhomework‚Äù or things I could be doing outside of sessions. You only spend 55min-1hr with your therapist so a majority of the ‚Äúwork‚Äù comes in between sessions so i always asked for some guidance on that.

"If you want affordable tele-therapy DM me and I will send you my list of referrals.  
I cracked the problem of affordable therapy.  I needed to crack it.  I get 8.5 hours of psychotherapy a week so I need to get most of it cheap.  (You can't get the delicious buffet of three therapists who work on me simultaneously.  But you can get pretty close to what I have.)    
I have made amazing progress in the last 10 months due to two things: first, the right drug.  See r/TherapeuticKetamine and KetamineTherapyForMentalHealth.com.  Second, because I found a really extraordinary therapist who was so cheap I could afford her for 6 hours a week.  There really are cost-effective solutions to most of our mental health problems.  I'm a very difficult case.  Nevertheless, I'm solving my problems fast enough to see the progress from month to month."

"Yesterday I couldn't feel things, feeling like a an empty shell. Feeling Things doesn't matter anymore. It was like I even couldn't be sad, just like a robot. So as usual I was convincing myself death would be a better option. I am still feeling it but not as much as before.

I was thinking how many weeks is left for me. How much I can survive... some unbearable questions. Can't adopt to pain.

Sometimes I hate myself... just too much. I mean when I feel nothing is left, should I be happy? 

I am still struggling to understand the concept of ""hope"". Sometimes I can feel it and most of the times there's nothing of it.

We just found out that the Reddit talks are coming to an end. It was an experimental feature that Reddit introduced and it‚Äôs coming to an end on 21st March. 

We‚Äôll try to host as many talks as we can until then.

"Saw my therapist today and I explained what I've been feeling.  A lot of this was triggered by two coworkers getting married to each other, and having a wedding shower.  I was also in a long term relationship with a coworker... but obviously it didn't end the same way. 

And I'm angry about that.  And sad.  And sucker punched.  And paranoid that others are whispering about us, and what a horrible person i must be. 

The wedding shower was today.  Baby showers, wedding showers... they all remind me of the ""almosts"" i described in my last post.  I've contributed to so many,  but never had anything remotely like this for myself.  Never. 

It's not exactly jealousy... it feels worse than that.  Bitterness maybe.  Anger that i played the hand i was dealt and lost all the family i had, or could have had, despite my best efforts. 

She said a lot of things today about my feelings... things that affirmed my feelings but acknowledged that my reasoning was faulty, and assured me that I'm human.  But she thinks I'm ""too smart"" to believe her... I've developed neural pathways that run deep, and a superior problem solving capacity, so I've convinced myself of false evidence. 

We're going to try EMDR for something different now.  I've had it for years for trauma and painful memories with good results,  but there are too many things that set me off these days.  So we're going to try EMDR as a tool to help me refocus my mind on good things now.  

I'll let you know if it works.  It helped my CPTSD so I'm hopeful."	mrsheartbroken	post	21.433347827746953	male	White	0.9923195242881775	na	na	na	4	MentalHealthIsland

"I was born to a young woman with a drug addiction and schizophrenia. She couldn't care for me. I was taken in by her parents, my grandparents. My father wasn't involved in my life until I was 22 or so years old.   


My younger brother was born when I was 3 years old, but I only saw him once until I was 27 years old. Since I was 27, I've only seen him about 3 more times, so I can count the number of times I have seen him in my 45 years on one hand. He was raised by his father's parents. 

Mom was in and out of my life, many times off her meds, when she'd deny I was her daughter because her daughter wasn't fat, and didn't wear glasses. Or any number of other reasons.   


My grandparents loved me, I know they did. But occasionally, things would surface that made me realize that I was a burden to them in every way. And I harbored a lot of guilt for that. 

I also had/have an aunt who is also schizophrenic, and she was around during my younger years, ripping the heads off my stuffed animals, or ripping necklaces from my throat in my sleep, or trying to crush my grandmother with a dresser. But she didn't help raise me necessarily. 

When I started school, I didn't realize it was weird to have a different last name than your parents. My last name was, let's say, ""Pancake."" My grandparents' and mother's last name was, let's say, ""Biscuit."" My father's last name (I didn't know when I was a kid) was, let's say, ""Croissant.""   


So where might you ask did my last name come from? ""Pancake"" came from the name of the man my mother was married to when she conceived me. I have no relation to him, but I was forced to carry his name.   


I started cutting when I was 14. It seemed like the most natural thing to do. 

When I turned 18, I felt that I had to leave my family home-not only to save my grandparents from the financial burden of caring for me, but also because their over-religious ways were stifling to my intellect, and life that I hoped to have.   


I fell into the arms of a man for 11 years-a man who humiliated me, betrayed me, and stole from me. I attempted suicide at age 19, and was hospitalized. Due to the abuse in the marriage, the cutting worsened, requiring stitches.   


He eventually left me, and I was alone for 5 years, until I found the man I wanted to be with forever. But last August, he left me too.   


Prior to August, everyone except my  aunt and sperm donor have died.  I don't know where my brother even is. There is little attachment or relationship with any of them, except that I pay for my aunt's clothing, food, and toiletries, and my father's phone bill. Why I do this, I don't know.   


I also pay for the remnants of the house we used to live in when I was a child. I'm not obligated to, but I feel responsibility for it. Again, I don't know why. I guess I just feel like my grandparents worked hard to build and maintain that house, and what kind of gratitude would I be showing if I left it to ruin.   


Anyway...tonight I'm struggling with the fact that I was almost a human being. I was almost a daughter, almost a sister.  I almost had a real last name, given to me by blood family or marriage, instead of getting the leftovers with no association whatsoever. I was almost a mother once. I was almost an aunt. Almost a cousin (my father's sister has children that never knew I existed until 2008). I wanted desperately to be a bride-a real bride. A real wife, as opposed to whatever I was when I was ages 21-30.   


My most recent partner was my fairy tale-he was everything I wanted, and the cherry on top was having been accepted by a real family, a mom and dad, and a faux sister in law. We had holidays and birthdays and dinners and they were wonderful, even though I often convinced myself that my presence was merely tolerated, as opposed to being loved and wanted around.   


In the end, to my dismay, I was right, as they've cast me to the wind as easily as dandelion blooms. Ten years of holidays, funerals, and memories meant nothing. I meant nothing, despite everything I did to love and care for their son and brother.    


A lifetime of ""almosts."" Almost good enough to be any of the aforementioned things, but not quite. Just not quite. ...because I do not quite have any of the relationships with anyone that other people have.  I've been shown time and time again that I'm good enough until something better comes along. I'm never a priority, never first, never the best option. I never have been. I've tried so very hard, but I never have been.   


I've mused that maybe I'm a mystical tulpa, a cursed golem, or a rogue planet--anything but an authentic person. I know how to look like one, and act like one, but I'm not one. And it's evident in the way my life, and the interactions in my life, have played out.   


I do not feel human tonight.

"Hello Mrs. Heartbroken i am somehow controlling my tears reading this. First of all I'm so sorry that you went through all this. You are such a strong person. You've endured so much and for so long. I wish you nothing but peace and joy. Please take care of yourself. You pay for all those bills, I am guessing you can afford taking care of yourself/pampering yourself. 

Secondly i have been going through a lot too lately and believe it or not i too was struggling with this feeling of not feeling human,  or that I'm not me, but living someone else's life. 
And recently things have changed.  I would like to share that with you maybe you'd find a perspective in here that'll help you. I got medical help. Not therapy (i had one session and i couldn't afford it further cuz it was 1,000 INR for each session) but i am on medicines for my mental health (anxiety, overthinking, lack of Focus). The treatment started in last October. 
It didn't change things like made me all happy and super productivity overnight. But it did help me with my constant breakdowns, anxiety, overthinking, and the peace that came with all this allowed me to think and make good decisions. Like getting on a diet which changed me physically and mentally. Which helped me get over my body image issues and i could go to my native place for more than 3 weeks. I havent been there in more than 7 years. I could not only stand them but could carry a conversation. So much so that i could make an impression that they are now missing me. Now that I'm back i have a new found spirit. Its not big I'll tell you but its there.  I feel human in what seems like decades tbh.

"If everyone were as human as you, we would have a much better, much different world. 

You are one the loveliest people I know. You're *so very* intelligent and kind. You truly want the best for others. You have the most giving of hearts. You are a rare jewel in this world. 

Most of all, for me, you gave me a hand to hold getting through my own heartache at the end of my relationship. It is not the same story.

You're grieving and in pain from both past and present. Seeing our worst fears play out, seemingly telling us we were right all along, is just brutal.

Except you are enough. You always have been. 

If anyone else were in your place you would know that. You could see that the damaged people, the abuse, the relationship that didn't work -- weren't about you (weren't your responsibility/fault). You gave love, you cared, you got hurt and neglected.

It was *never* about your value or humanity.

"I am 18 
Before I was diagnosed with anxiety. I was seriously ill because I didn't know how to handle my emotions. It caused me to throw up, have terrible head aches and stomach aches... 
When I finally was diagnosed with social anxiety and adhd 
I was sent to a remedial school... there I was sent to home school where I thrived..

But in highschool I was sent back to ""normal school""


This then exposed me to people who self diagnosed themselves with anxiety, ocd, and depression 

This infuriated me because after years of my struggles and doctor appointment after another, with medication that made me so thin because it killed my appetite and break downs all the time to be finally I'm a place where I can cope 

For people to fake, lie and falsely experiences episodes of my own illness because they think it's ""cool"" or trendy to be need extra attention and help through things they don't need help for... 

I feel many people in my community that suffer the same things I do, are being falsely misrepresented and our problems being seen as something that is a must have 

My personal experience is of When I had camp and a girl asked my directly how it is to have social anxiety/ general anxiety  and adhd 

I said difficult. Because I struggle in school because of my lack of focusing skills and my anxiety of people judging me.. 

She then says how she suffers from ocd because she had to turn the light on 3 times and can't have her books not colour codes because it stresses her out... at this point I blow up because I've known her for  years at this point and never had she had the need to do any of these things 

Ocd does not just consist of light and colour. But constant stress of everything around you 

I want social media to stop making disorders trendy because, I find it disgusting for me and others to be seen as a trend.

Flaky\_Revolution4104 there's no reason for you to apologize for ranting about these problems. I strongly agree with you about people who fake disorders for attention, I'm 18 as well, and I have adhd, ocd, and really bad anxiety. Most days are very difficult for me because I go to a school where I'm the only person with all these issues. Most of my classmates don't associate with me because they don't like the fact that I talk CONSTANTLY. I have gotten used to being alone. But I turn to God and it really helps, especially when I sink back into my depression hole. Aside from all that I just want you to know that you aren't alone and you can always talk to me or anyone else in this community.  üíñ	Flaky_Revolution4104	reply	na	na	na	0.9962090253829956	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

So, I tend to take breaks often from Instagram. Most of the time, it‚Äôs only because I feel like I have been doing it too much or there so much negativity. I tend to doom-scroll a lot. I know it‚Äôs not a healthy habit, but it‚Äôs kinda hard not too. I  just feel really drained after being on there for so long. So, I usually take breaks. The break usually lasts for a week, but recently, it‚Äôs been much longer because I haven‚Äôt really been tempted to go on there. Is that weird?

"Not at all. It's actually been proven that the overwhelming majority of social media  accounts are fake and have things like scammers, bots, or even nation-state misinformation programs behind them. And then the majority of actual human accounts are just curated fa√ßades which lend little to what is actually going on behind the curtain.

Just disconnect, take a breath, live your life, and save on all those monthly data costs while simultaneously improving focus and attention to things that are important in your life, like actual loved ones, family, friends (the real ones, not the hundreds of thousands you don't really know that you just clicked a button on the Interwebs to accept as a friend from lord knows where).

I deleted my Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat over two years ago. One of my better decisions. For me I came to realize I was constantly comparing myself to others and seeing myself as a failure through a social media lens. It also forced me to be more active socially and find lots of new hobbies away from my computer to fill the void. One thing I regret is I did not save all my pictures and videos, the comments/messages haven‚Äôt thought once about but the memories were in those photos and videos. So if you decide to delete it all together be sure to download or screenshot anything you might want later.	Secure_Opening_6852	reply	na	na	na	0.9949079155921936	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
Currently gave up social media for lent. I‚Äôm not particularly religious but there is something about challenging yourself to give something up for 40 days/40 nights. The first week or two was really challenging for me because it was such a bad habit. But I think I‚Äôm over the ‚Äúworst‚Äù of it. And I feel clear headed and more grounded. I don‚Äôt know if I would give it up forever but I don‚Äôt think it was healthy spending 2+ hrs on it everyday when there were more beneficial things I could be spending it on. I feel like I have SO much free time now, I‚Äôm finally finishing learning Spanish and read 2 books. 12/10 recommend giving it up even for just a few weeks!

"Definitely! Especially if you use social media mainly to interact with random strangers debating things that are not at all constructive and only causes frustration in the process.

Best way to do that is to uninstall the apps completely off of your phone. I had Facebook uninstalled a few weeks back and I am way better off now. I still use Facebook every now and then when I have to see something, but on my desktop browser or my mobile browser, and using it in a browser makes me way less likely to get hooked to it and keep using it for hours.

So you don't have to 100% disconnect yourself from social media, but definitely limit the time you spend on it and what you do there.  


As for Instagram. I completely despise it. It gives you a false view of the World around you, everyone looks so good, their lives looks so happening, in the process you feel like your life is so much worse, when in reality the pics you see the people in it are not any different. One pic at a party is not their whole life, after the party they go home, they have the same old life, they cook food, worry about money, have to go back to work.. so never tell yourself you are worse than anybody just because you don't post photos of you doing parties on a cruise ship every now and then."

"I am struggling with many things at the same time, but right now I feel like I can't get over my past, especially stuff that I didn't do/experience when I was younger and that influenced me in adulthood and stuff that I will never experience in my life, at least not in the same way that I could have experienced as a teenager/young adult. (It's mainly romantic/sexual things and the toll it took on my self-esteem and confidence.)  
  
So I read articles and watched videos about CBT (because I prefer things that are evidence-based) and now I decided to start therapy (CBT), but something has been bugging me:  
  
Everything I read/watched seems to be focused on the present and the future, but what about when the cause of the problems comes from the past? If someone has difficulty accepting the past or feels that they did not do what they would like at some point in the past and that they missed an opportunity and this affects how they feel today, as there is no way to change or to have those experiences now. So the time has kind of passed. The articles/videos seem to be focused on anxiety and motivation and more tangible things, but for less practical things and the past, it seems that CBT ends up being just an exercise in conformism since you can't change the past, and changing how you feel is not a practical solution in itself, it is ""just"" a way of accepting what happened, which seems to go against some suggestions that I saw about emotional intelligence: don't run away from your feelings, dive into them, so that you can understand your feelings and take better decisions. But why would you delve into your feelings if they are unresolvable situations, so there are no decisions to be taken?  
  
Does anyone have suggestions about what I could do?"	The_Dark_Anubis	post	28.482844498067973	male	White	0.9989675283432007	na	na	na	4	MentalHealthIsland

sticks\_04 I know how you feel, 2 weeks ago I ran from my house bc I'm in the same boat as you, but you have to think about what you do once you run away. I didn't think ahead before I left so I had to figure out where I was gonna go bc I don't have a car, so I didn't have a place to stay. Eventually I went to a friends house and they let me stay for a while. I ended up going back home and talked to my parents and they were understanding about it, and they are trying to get me the help I need.	sticks_04	reply	na	na	na	0.07186931371688843	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

"Possible Tw?
I‚Äôm 18 years old.
I‚Äôve been wanting to start driving since 16. I don‚Äôt want a car, I want to start drivers Ed and to learn. 
Last week my mom finally got me a new birth certificate (she lost my old one), and we finally got an id.
I‚Äôve been wanting a job, but cannot get one since I had no id.  As well as, my parents will complain if they have to drive me places.

Tonight I went outside to do dry off the fake wooden shelf we put one of our cat boxes in. I washed it. My mom started screaming and scolding me because she ‚Äútold me to bring that thing in 2 weeks ago.‚Äù
I replied it has only been a few days.
She proceeded to scream, threaten me, scream some more.
When I go outside and start drying it, my father approaches me and starts scolding me, and scolding me. Then starts saying I need to do more around the house. That I don‚Äôt do enough.
‚ÄúWhen I was your age I had 3 jobs!!!‚Äù
:(
I would have a job by now if I could.
I do the best I can. I‚Äôm the only person who does the inside housework basically.  I keep my grades all A‚Äôs, I‚Äôm in hard classes, I just got two medals for a competition. Yet it‚Äôs never enough.
So I began crying.

He stared at me like I was some sort of freak. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to leave until he was done scolding me.

When I go inside, I started crying even more. I was so scared, I know I‚Äôm not allowed to cry. I was right.
My mom came in, threatening me for crying. Then calling me immature and like a little 5 year old for balling myself up and sobbing.

Then my dad came in again after she left. Scolding me again.


I feel trapped. Im not happy.
I just feel like crying, but Im not allowed to. They‚Äôre always like this."	Elegant_Mix_7239	post	16.000802303085408	female	White	0.9985357522964478	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

Sometimes I‚Äôm just not enough. My friend feels horrible when he stays up late, but because our time zones are so far apart, he stays up late to talk to me. I when I found out him hating himself so much correlates with staying up late, I told him he should stop staying up late to talk to me. He refused though, and said that if he‚Äôs one of the few things preventing my mental health from going downhill again (which he is), it‚Äôs worth it to stay up. He said it would be selfish to go to sleep earlier and I get the feeling that he wouldn‚Äôt go to sleep sooner even if he had nothing to do with my mental health. I told him it‚Äôs not selfish to take care of himself and I‚Äôd be fine even if we talked a bit less, but he still refused. I told him I‚Äôm worried about him and don‚Äôt want his mental health to get worse over time, but he said it‚Äôs fine because he has me and I make him feel better. My mental health used to be like his, hating myself, thinking everyone else does and not understanding why someone would care about me, and it was horrible. I‚Äôve also had other friends who had horrible mental health that I tried to help, but it got too out of hand and just like this, they wouldn‚Äôt listen when I told them to take care of themselves. I wish I could just force people to take care of themselves, but I can‚Äôt. Not all of those friends were alright in the end and I‚Äôm scared that he‚Äôll end up like them. I don‚Äôt want his mental health to get as bad as mine used to be either. He won‚Äôt listen to me though and I of course can‚Äôt do anything about it and I just feel so helpless again, being able to do nothing. I‚Äôve been helpless too many times when it relates to other people‚Äôs mental health and I don‚Äôt know what to do and I‚Äôm scared.

"I try to be kind and supportive as often as i can because i know what it feels like to be starved of those things.  

I tried to be supportive of someone online, but the conversations went south.  I asserted myself and told them i didn't want to talk about certain things (sexual things), and that i wasn't  in a place where i felt comfortable with it.  They seemed cool about it,   but then the conversation went south a second time.

I blocked him, but I'm second guessing myself.  Was i irrational? He was pretty cool, and we had some good talks,  but I'm not looking for anything more than friendship and being able to provide support. When things turned the second time,  i couldn't handle it.  I'd already told him once i couldn't do that.   

Talking about those things makes me super uncomfortable. I panicked, and because of the sexual pressure and illness and other things,  I had a week long ""episode"" (all this was going on when i made my last post about dissociation and derealization).

But it is one of those situations where you are frustrated over their know-it-all attitude and when you have finally reached your limit and your expressions show some sort of annoyance. They would depict it as disrespectful when in reality you did not say or do anything. 

And it would totally be fine if she tells me things or corrects me in a respectful and friendly manner, not in a way that makes me feel like utter crap and that I have made the worst mistake in my life.

They made be considered the elder due to their age but that does not give them a ticket to act however they want and just assume that the younger one would continue to lick the bottom of their foot like some kind of submissive dog. 

Like people with anxiety and who have gone through depression before. this is some additional baggage that they have to deal with and I for one am sick of it. 

Sorry, this is a burst of frustration, and it gives me some form of comfort here. I hope that's fine."	Oddlawstudent	post	29.703061734840503	male	White	0.9987366795539856	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthIsland

"So there was this sort of festivity going on at a public space that is known for hosting festivals. I thought I saw some food stalls and heard loud music, but didn't see a ticket desk. So I asked the security guard what kind of event was taking place and he just smirked without looking at me and made a small hand gesture that signified get lost. Body language is very expressive. I felt humiliated but played dumb. I asked again in a friendly voice what kind of event was taking place, holding my hand to my ear, as if I hadn't noticed his dismissive smirk and gesture the first time, and simply thought he had said something inaudible.

This time he turned to look at me, made a couple of quick steps towards me and said in an aggressive tone: Do you want something buddy?

I repeated my phrase: What kind of event is taking place?

Some event, he said. A private one.

I had made him give me an answer that didn't denigrate my humanity. A simple piece of information a person in charge of admissions to a public space would give passers by who inquired in a civilized society.

I left, still feeling like worthless garbage of course, but successful at appeasing the guard who had contempted me.

Why do I care if some professional thug likes me? Why do I want to be friends with him. Even the word buddy resonated with me nicely when of course it was said aggressively.

It all starts in childhood. From abusive parents. A child can't say I don't care. A child loves his parents. Why do you hit me when I love you? The appeasement begins. And is then repeated throughout life, in random situations like this, in reflexive behaviors that manifest instantly, before you have time to think. 

Does any of the people who treat me poorly in life care what I think of them. They have their own people. 

Weakness makes you lonely. Noone likes a lonely person. And loneliness makes you even weaker. Needing the affection of any random stranger."	Peripatitis	post	27.957334744910124	male	White	0.9855836629867554	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

"Again,  your words echo what i often feel.  

I don't know how old you are,  but I'm 45. If there's one thing i can tell you, it's never too late to press the reset button if there's something you aren't happy with in your life. For me, one of the things was not finishing my degree in my twenties... so i finished it by age 40.

That being said, did that ultimately bring me happiness? No... but it did satisfy a longing to finish something i started, which in turn helped me create some semblance of security. 

I struggle every day wondering what the point of all of this is.  Every day.  Some days the only thing i can do is tell myself i exist to piss everyone off who made me feel like i shouldn't exist.  Some days i don't have the strength to even do that. 

If there's one thing that I've found to ease some of these feelings... and it is going to sound kind of lame... it's taking care of the child side of me who wants little things every so often.  Like... if i see a stuffed animal i like,  or if there's any tiny little something that i never get for myself,  I'll give in to the little girl that wants something... just to show her a little bit of attention and love.  I don't go on a spree or anything (well, i just got a bunch of work pants but that doesn't count), just that one little thing.  It's amazing how much better it makes me feel to give myself something small,  even if it's just a couple of gummy bears or a face mask off the clearance aisle in the store.

It's not about the amount i spend or being frivolous as much as it is almost like the feeling of giving a child something they would like.  And the adult and child in me feels good.  

I do believe things will improve for you.  It doesn't happen overnight,  but they will.  In 45 years i can tell you that nothing lasts indefinitely, good or bad.   üíú"		reply	na	na	na	0.9994625449180603	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

I've been meaning to attend one of their get-togethers for months now. And all week, I was telling myself, today's the day. I'm gonna get up there and meet some nerds and it'll be great.

So this morning, I'm getting dressed, and then I just found myself staring at myself in the bathroom mirror, thinking, I'm not going to know anyone, it's going to be awkward and weird, I'm not going to have a good time, and then I'm going to feel trapped in this unknown place, a 40 minute bus road from home. And I just couldn't bring myself to do it.

"I have been using escapism to the extreme these past few years. This has only exaggerated my problems. In these past few days, in these moments of clarity , I am getting immense anxiety. My heartbeat accelerates and I'm in tears.  I feel everyday that I am really really close to a breakdown and I am afraid of facing the consequences of all the things I'm avoiding. I feel like everything is going to come crashing down and everyone's going to know how much i have been lying about things. I have always been a coward. I keep lying to people I care about. And is the biggest issue for all my problems. I know i should stop lying to everybody and most importantly myself but over these past few years this has become a habit and almost become second nature. I'm so lost in my fantasy life I can't feel anything except the occasional crying which i quickly try to get rid off by more escapism. I'm so used to things being the way the are. I don't even have a decent memory anymore. 

But today at this moment rgt now I want to remember all the trauma and pain just to feel something. 

This constant cycle. I am exhausted. I keep avoiding my friends coz i feel such a worthless person. Meet them once in like 6 months. I get worried about me not caring about their lives which only leads  more guilt and isolating myself even more.  They must be confused about what's happening with me. Disappear. Show up. Disappear. Show up. What the fuck is wrong with me? It feels like I don't have real reason to be like this. Its me pulling myself down everytime. Will they forgive me for not being a part of their lives for so many months? What a shitty friend i am? Man i should lay low again.

Idk how long i am going to keep living like this. Is their any advise/ small steps u can suggest me in this situation"	punpun_pun	post	15.740538427761681	male	White	0.9960553646087646	na	na	na	6	MentalHealthIsland

What were the steps to shifting your mentality? I could use a paradigm shift too xD I'm dealing with the aftermath of a miscarriage two years back and had some weird symptoms last month that brought it all back up. My husband is stressed with work and took it out on me while I was struggling, which was similar to what happened during my loss. I'm functioning fine on the outside, but inside there is so much inner turmoil. I feel alone, insecure and unsupported by everyone- some of this I know is a pattern that started in my childhood, but I can't seem to logic my way out of it- bc it feels like a deep truth.

One big thing I‚Äôve learned recently is that perspective is the biggest thing in life. I‚Äôll tell y‚Äôall what when shit sucks‚Ä¶.it sucks but rather than feeling like everything things against you look at it in the sense of a friend going through the same thing. I‚Äôm sure many of us are the same as myself and if someone needs to open up to me and wants to talk, I‚Äôll drop everything to just listen. We have to remember that WE are people too and that other people would be willing to do the same thing for us. If it‚Äôs just us on our own trying to process everything we‚Äôll convince ourselves that we‚Äôre bottom of the barrel and not worth caring about. That‚Äôs just cause our brain is against us. Imagine a doctor operating on themselves, it‚Äôs gonna be a whole lot harder than if they had someone to help them. It‚Äôs the same exact thing as all of our mental healths.

" I and my ex were in a long distance relationship. He used to force me to touch myself down there and send him voice messages of me moaning. It all happened over texts and I told him 'no' many times. He still wouldn't stop and text things like ""when I tell you to do it, you do it"". I was scared that I would disappoint him and I did it. I enjoyed it sometimes but not always.

When we met, at one instance he wanted to touch me down there. I told him 'no' but he got angry and I was scared again that I won't be able to satisfy him. Hence, I gave in again and let him do it. The second instance was he wanted to finger me. I kept saying ""no"" repeatedly but he did it.

I really didn't think of these all until a month after our breakup. He was the one who dumped me telling that he wasn't over his ex and he never loved me, he just thought he did.

Anyone who went through the similar situation, please help me understand what this is. Thanks in advance <333"		post	27.09890863754966	female	White	0.04656543955206871	na	na	na	6	MentalHealthIsland

"I hate that you're feeling these things, however,  your candor tells me that you've got insight into what you're going through, and that insight is half of the battle.  

Self harm isn't linear, and you just stop wanting to do it in times of stress. I still think of it, but now, the urges are kind of like little waves that come over me and then wash away.  I don't know how to explain it.  It isn't as if i don't want to still do it, but it passes quickly.

"I used to message here a lot about my abusive parents and my anxiety. For those of you that read my story, I‚Äôm out of there now and staying with some super supportive people.

I‚Äôm currently trying to get a tutoring side job off the ground. It‚Äôs been‚Ä¶a struggle but I‚Äôm making slow, steady progress. I have the skills, just not the students.

And I‚Äôm a little happy about it? Like, it‚Äôs nice taking this time to heal. I‚Äôm noticing a lot of the trauma I need to address once I can afford therapy (i‚Äôm currently on Medicare and Food stamps no shame!) 

Is that a normal response? Is it okay that I‚Äôm doing this? Is it okay that I‚Äôm taking time to breathe? 

I have been applying to jobs as well, don‚Äôt worry. I have a backup plan to go for my teaching credential or eventually save up to get SAT/ACT test certified.

Today I had a meeting with a career coach from my school. It‚Äôs been 8 months since I‚Äôve graduated and I still haven‚Äôt landed a full time job in my position. I know my problem isn‚Äôt new, in fact it‚Äôs fairly common, but it still sucks. During the meeting the couch gave me good advice and helped me with my resume, but I still lack the motivation to start applying. With this recent economic downturn, who‚Äôs going to be hiring now a days. It feels like getting a full time job seems like a Herculean task. I‚Äôm so sick and tired of spending hours of writing, researching, drafting and applying for jobs. I mean what‚Äôs the point, it‚Äôs not like anyone is hiring. Anyway, everything sucks, things seem to get increasingly worse before they get marginally better.	cerulean-heart	post	18.11566463966664	female	White	0.9988858103752136	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

Struggling to obtain a permanent job and feel disheartened to carry on is rough, yet there are still opportunities out there, even in a turbulent economic situation. Think about extending your job search to related industries or jobs and check with alums or pros for networking. Take care of yourself and solicit aid if needed. Continue putting in the effort and stay committed, and eventually you'll discover the appropriate job.	cerulean-heart	reply	na	na	na	0.9988858103752136	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

"This past year has been about exploring all of my feelings. A lot has come out in the last year and I think its been a little volatile. I have never been allowed to really express all of my feelings and emotions until this last year. I‚Äôve never allowed myself to feel. It‚Äôs been hard. Even my wife doesnt want to hear some of the stuff I feel. I feel deranged. And I think its a bit much sometimes. I feel sorry for my therapist. She says I shouldn‚Äôt apologize. But I feel like a lot of the toxicity of my life is finally coming out. My head hurts. Ill never be perfect. I am still trying to figure out where the line is I can‚Äôt cross and it is scary. I‚Äôve felt like a monster for years. Three years ago I stopped talking to my family all together. I‚Äôve never felt supported really by them even though they say that they support whatever I do with my life. Did not feel genuine to me. I‚Äôve been harassed without mercy for having ADHD. I wanted to do things my way. I never had a real childhood and I fear my kid is experiencing the same thing. I felt embarrassed to have friends at my house growing up as a kid. Nothing felt normal as a kid. I wanted therapy as a kid but was scared to actually ask for help in anything I felt. Any issues i felt was met with more ADHD medications. Gender Dysphoria as a kid was bad. I felt scared to ask for help for it because I grew up catholic. I knew it felt wrong and right at the same time. My last marriage was just for my kid. I was going to leave my ex before I found out she was pregnant. Alcohol was a terrible substance at the time we were together. I cut back significantly to one to four beers every month. It doesn‚Äôt control me or my life. It does however control my sons through my ex wife.

I had to bow out of my kids life for several years (yeah I know i sound like a monster). But what other options did I ever have. I had zero support system where I live. I lived 12-15 hours away from family who would tell me to experience the nightmare of my now exwife. It would have been the literal end of me. (Avoiding the banned words here) I was at wits end with her."	Glittering_Layer_602	post	32.22871149975394	male	White	0.0027243567164987326	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

You aren‚Äôt the monster.  From what I see here you are working on things.  I can‚Äôt remember where I read this but I know it was some self help or medical journal.

The memories of the relationship at this point are jumbled and hazy‚Ä¶ I worked through EMDR.. I think its unfair that I can‚Äôt recall everything just to work through my past. People sometimes tell me its over and move forward. I can‚Äôt I still live with it. I want it to stop. I get stuck in the freeze cycle often. My sense of self worth sometimes is stunted but that even stems from my youth. My current wife tells me that I have had a better life than most and that I shouldn‚Äôt harbor any negative feelings about my youth nor my family‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know really what to feel about that. I try to encourage my kid to do great things.. He‚Äôs good about the thoughts of staying away from alcohol. In fact he knows all too well what it does. I cant imagine what he has seen and heard. I‚Äôve been trying to reach out to my sons therapist and tell him my concerns‚Ä¶ He doesnt respond. Frankly im convinced that my ex wife has told his therapist not to talk to me.

Firstly, I‚Äôm not suicidal, never have been. I have children, when I‚Äôm at my lowest I think of them and going to leave the planet like that and have them left to grieve. I‚Äôm disabled, and most of my time is spent just taking care of myself. I have chronic pain, chronic fatigue and it takes me so long to complete the simplest task- preparing food, taking a shower. At the end of the day I ask ,myself what did I do today? The answer is embarrassingly short. I‚Äôll probably add more detail of my miserable existence in the comments. I‚Äôm posting to ask for help. Please recommend podcasts or documentaries on Netflix . I‚Äôd found a few podcast that were uplifting and made me laugh - in a dark humor sort of way. But they have stopped making episodes. I live alone and want to listen to something and have something to think about as I slowly go about my day. I like history, I like understanding how things work. Sometimes I like comedy and advice podcasts. What I don‚Äôt care for is anything religious or romantic. I‚Äôm single and lonely as fuck. Don‚Äôt care to hear about anyone else falling in love. TIA for suggestions.	mentaldrift13	post	33.374050788491886	male	White	0.9972298741340637	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland
"Just curious‚Ä¶do you have fibromyalgia?  I also suffer from Chronic Fatigue and pain and have fibromyalgia.  One lucky thing for me is I‚Äôm still able to work full time.  But I‚Äôm so exhausted from work that when I get home I can‚Äôt do anything.  I struggle taking showers and cooking meals.  I just want to nap after both.  When I was first diagnosed I was suicidal for the first few months.

Even though I was down for a few hours today but I'm happy that it wasn't suicidal and I see myself recover better each time I fall down. Although I hated myself for a few hours but then regained my strength better. I feel I see the results slowly. As we know there are ups and downs so I'm more patient with myself.

"In August, i said it would be a miracle if i survived the winter.  Holidays, birthdays- i didn't think i would be able to make it.  I thought the sadness would swallow me whole.  

But yesterday marked the end of the birthday/ holiday season.. FINALLY.  A long 4 months, in agony if i were to be honest.  Torture... torture of the heart and spirit. A reflection of my loneliness and everyone and everything I've lost,  magnified by the veil of mirth and consumerism as far as the eye can see. 

But i survived.  I feel like i can breathe again.  For now anyway. No holiday magnification of a life that is no more... at least not for now. 

The days will get hotter now,  and longer,  drenched by a humid blanket of sweltering summer sun.  But they will be free from the ghosts of lifetimes past... at least for a little while.  üíú"	mrsheartbroken	post	26.1747035286308	female	White	0.002464442979544401	na	na	na	5	MentalHealthIsland

We don‚Äôt have a set schedule. Live talks are hosted at the moderator‚Äôs discretion and sometimes we like to take breaks too, to tend to our own mental healths.

"Recently i was talking to my psych regarding stopping of anti depressants because i feel a lot better and have not been suicidal for a very long time. He also agreed and said we'll taper it once you get settled with your career.(this was when everything was going smoothly i was exercising daily,getting my sunlight, making profits in trading,proper wake up routine). 

Today i had been so suicidal,the burst of all the emotions. I have so become so scared to even do anything in my career. My parents, specially my father has way to many illnesses (even had mucormycosis,in which his one eye and left jaw has been removed). He's also blind. So mother is the one who takes care of him(medicines,food,bathing,insulin,bp)while he manages his business. And his businesses have started to create financial havoc.(one is rental which profitable and other is wholesale trading which is loss making.)

 So basically i have to take care of some parts of business,but they are majorly back end. So due to my parents health I've not been able to make up mind to leave them alone and there aren't much jobs in my city. And now that since it's been such a long time since i left college ,i find it very difficult to even try for jobs.(after college i was managing my father's loss making business,but after finding out it's been loss making i left it). And my father is very toxic and narcissistic,he makes sure i feel very low about myself and he kinda of coerced me into joining his business because of his illnesses. 

So,now i am so scared to do anything in my career except for investing or trading in stock market,and when the trades don't go my way i start to criticize myself that you're going to burn all your mother's savings.
I don't know what to do,i just find excuses to everything.I get anxious doing anything,and have left any hope whatsoever.I feel like i should die because i know I'm a piece of shit."	bitchh_im_a_cow	post	17.446323122045634	male	White	0.998927891254425	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthIsland

"So, I'm dealing with being in a new relationship. I DESPERATELY need a framework in which to evaluate myself to know - with 100% scientific and rational certainty and not with ""wu-wu"", feel-good platitudes not rooted in anything scientific or rational. I'm afraid I'm going to blow it in this relationship with this woman, and it will result in my suicide because it will confirm I'm not worthy. I don't understand how to construct a fully cogent and logical rubric in which to evaluate myself as a member and contributor to the species. Additionally, I have the following:

* I am a follower of a pop-culture related sub where they are comparing sexual marketplace values. This SCREAMS to me that this is a critical measure for evaluating my worth as a human. I can't seem to create a logical flow in which people discuss this but it is not important your worth - it must be somehow important for it to discussion-worthy. I am SO TERRIFIED that I have little to no sexual marketplace value due to my height and other things, and if this value is 0 I think I would need to consider suicide as I'd just be taking up resources and not valuable to the propagation of the species otherwise.
* It's a Friday night and I can't think of anything to do. This indicates I have low social worth which TERRIFIES me and indicates I might not be deserving of a life and completely failing. I hate Fridays so much because there is so much pressure to be a social person - I'm really convinced marketing, advertising, social comparison serve CRITICAL function to separate the worthy from the unworthy and am feeling VERY unworthy.

I'm really struggling...really, really struggling...I need a near constant return signal of validation that I matter and I can't find it. That's the only evidence I would have to know that I should exist."		post	24.068698881640252	female	White	0.9965298771858215	na	na	na	5	MentalHealthIsland

"Please don‚Äôt think like this. It really seems like you are over thinking in so many aspects. Your life has value not because of your height and sexual marketplace value but because you are a human being. Don‚Äôt let sub reddits and other peoples opinions determine your worth as a person. You are a human being, you have value and you deserve love and kindness. You say that it‚Äôs Friday and you don‚Äôt know what to do, which means you have no social worth therefore you have no value. That is false. I‚Äôm sitting at home on a Friday night as well, but does that mean I‚Äôm not deserving of life, absolutely not. 

Your really overthinking this. Please try and be kind to yourself, you have worth and value don‚Äôt let the media tell you otherwise. Also I hope your relationship is going okay, just be yourself and see how it goes. (I don‚Äôt want to seem pessimistic here) but if the relationship doesn‚Äôt go as planned, that is in no way a reason for you not being worthy. Relationships work and sometimes they don‚Äôt. You just have to keep your head up and try and find the right person. You are worthy of life, please don‚Äôt give up. 

I think it‚Äôs really sad how media, advertisement and so on, can have such an affect on peoples lives. We often feel pressured to follow the constructs of society, which is forced through media, and that just creates a negative belief that people have on them selves. It ruins self esteem and value and it‚Äôs wrong. But please don‚Äôt let this mess with you. Don‚Äôt let other opinions change you as a person. 

Have you tried therapy, it was very helpful for me. Also have you opened up to family/friends about how you are feeling?

"The idea that humans only have value according to their social or economic contribution is rooted (in the West anyway) in some dumb Protestant ‚Äúwork ethic‚Äù.

The framework you seek is simple. You have intrinsic value. That‚Äôs it. You matter. If you‚Äôre looking for some kind of proof, you won‚Äôt find it, but I can tell you unequivocally that you matter. I know this because you matter to me.

There are no ‚Äúunworthy‚Äù people. The idea that there is some social framework against which we should measure our value is pure evil. Don‚Äôt drink that kool aid.

"It's hard, but try not to judge yourself by your success in dating.

Dating culture is pretty shallow and gross at large. The apps have made judgement based on quantitative superficial features even worse. When in reality you spend most of your time with this person and it's the non-quantifiable features that make the connection meaningful and worthwhile.

I've witnessed a majority of people in my life pick pretty terrible partners that end in divorce, affairs, or other categories of big messes --  they picked their partner not based on compatibility but based on useless morphological features or social ranking features that get amplified to pointless levels in social media and traditional culture.

There's alot of pressure to date or seem socially relevant, so I get that. But life is so much richer and deeper than manipulating dating scenarios to increase your reputation in the minds of judgmental, surface-level people.

If you're surrounded by people who's lives are entirely about dating and mating, which is pretty common (at least in America), then you're going to see the world through that lens and likely going to be unhappy most of the time.

Life is really a wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide open thing. It just gets reduced to a needlepoint by popular culture. You can analyze your feelings and relationships to determine what is actually bringing your joy and sorrow, and whether playing those games are worth it.

Something that works for me when I get depressed or have landed in a toxic social group is to work on hobbies or my career, where I know that my time spent will lead to a wider variety of options in choosing how I live my life. 

If I feel up to dating, then I focus on the external factors and get in shape and all the sort of low-bar hoops you have to jump through, which can also keep you busy and pay off. But remember that dating is a rollercoaster and we have sex hormones built in that are some of the strongest internal signals we have (e.g. if we don't mate, we don't survive, so evolution has selected organisms with nervous systems with strong sex drive, and these aren't really tuned to mate selection as much as generating children as crude as that sounds.)

Hopefully others can offer suggestions as well and worst case just focus on getting through the night and re-evaluate your situation in the morning."		reply	na	na	na	0.9965298771858215	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
"Here's the challenge with the metric you're asking for - it doesn't exist. It isn't real. There is no scientific, rational framework to measure human value. 

Furthermore, the pop culture standards you're referring to are unrealistic. They're candy coated bullshit. The makeup, lighting, tailored clothing, plastic surgery and physical trainers and all that it takes to get the ideal body and the best look? It's not sustainable.

"Happy birthday mate. Try not to worry about what others may or may not think. Your a star you deserve the absolute best life has to offer and it's never too reinvent yourself. 

Just a few small adjustments will have a massive effect on your confidence and self esteem. 

Drink water as often as you can, it'll help with the dark spots/pimples etc. 

Do 1 press up everyday, (yes just 1) at roughly the same time every day. Strength isn't the goal at first, it's about developing the habit. Once you have the habit down increase to a number your comfortable with. But for now just aim for 1 everyday. 

Baby steps is the key to all of this start small but  start. Document your progress here if it helps or in a journal.

I am sorry you feel this way. My son is 20 and struggles with acne. He was able to resolve his face pretty well by working with a dermatologist but he has a lot on his back. I know he is embarrased about that. I imagine that you have tried medical help for the skin issues? Many people are successfully treated for acne.

"When I am out in the world or speaking with people, I get so frazzled and have a very difficult time trying to piece together my thoughts or remembering important and revelant information. This usually ends in all parties being confused, frustrated, and some sort of valuable information or details being left out unintentionally. As a result, I feel like my reputation takes a hit and I get labeled as spacey and unintelligent. My confidence also takes a huge hit because of this, which seems to just make this problem even worse. However, I have noticed that when I am writing my thoughts out and communicating via text, letters, emails, etc that I am really able to form my thoughts completely and that I actually am fairly intelligent, logical, and informed. It is so frustrating that I can't seem to figure out how to bridge this gap between my written and verbal communication or communicate in the moment to others without everything just coming out like a giant plate of word spaghetti. I was also recently diagnosed with ADHD, which I had known and suspected since basically birth but never got treated. I had a defect in my heart and now my psychiatrist is making me wait 8-12 weeks to see a cardiologist to see if they will clear me for stimulant medication for my ADHD since the straterra did absolutely zero and made me feel very sick. This seems to be negatively impacting me in so many areas of my life, causing me to struggle and get reprimanded at work, fail my classes, struggle with building and maintaining relationships and friendships.. etc. Which just makes my depression and anxiety so much worse. 

Anyways... can anyone relate to this? Feeling lost, confused, and very frustrated. Why am I this way? How can I change it?"	capitalcali	post	35.03861261610601	female	White	0.9983788728713989	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

So basically I‚Äôm what is commonly phrased by society as a ‚Äònice guy‚Äô. As I continue to socialize and explore more of the world I just hate more and more being a nice guy. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt exactly feel as if it‚Äôs something I can just turn of. I recently made this friend who eventually confessed that she‚Äôs into me. Obviously I was shocked and couldn‚Äôt believe what I was hearing. I began paying her more attention and things seemed to be going well. However as our time together continued she came to the revelation that I‚Äôma ‚Äònice guy‚Äô and all of sudden our time together just ended. When I think of what comes to mind, if I was to not be a nice guy, my thoughts are pretty much getting really flirty with a girl. Saying inappropriate things in the hopes that she‚Äôll enjoy hearing that side of me, and basically being a bit if a jerk. So to put it more simply ‚Äòa bad guy‚Äô. I know this kinda guy isn‚Äôt exactly a bad guy but you know as well as I do, that it‚Äôs the jocks and bad boys that‚Äôll usually be in a relationship. Whilst in that relationship, the relationship will either eventually end, or that ‚Äòbad boy‚Äô will suddenly realize that he actually really likes this girl and decide to change his ways. The point is, even if that dilemma did actually become an actual relationship, it began with that boy putting on the bad boy face, and then went on from there. It makes me feel like I want to be a bad boy. Like I want to go grab some girl and be all inappropriate with her becausefrom what I can see, that is what will eventually lead to actual feelings between us. Being a nice guy is the worst	Ok_Anxiety4808	post	9.379992824181123	male	White	0.9983227849006653	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthIsland

Yes as someone that just got diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, I see how my phone has played a huge role in contributing to that. I deactivated my Instagram, took YouTube off of my phone, and I'm about to do that with Reddit. Everything is just a distraction and I'm over stimulated with all the information that is available right at my fingertips. I am actively trying to get better at focusing on one thing at a time. Just the other day, I was able to read one chapter of a book. Granted, I had to read out loud so I could hear myself because if I read in my head, I can't comprehend.

"And I've been trying to learn how to love myself (not that I really did before). I guess now I just have to learn to love this version of me also. I've had it for almost a year now. I've had to mourn the loss of my former self. The realization that I can't be as impulsive and free as I once was which actually isn't necessarily a bad thing now that I think about it. It allows me to take my time to get to know somebody. I am a lot more guarded now. I know that herpes isn't as bad as the media portrays it to be now that I've done my research on it. ""A lot of things will kill you, but herpes is not one of them"" is what I keep telling myself.

I have my good days and I have my bad days. Along with that, I have recently been diagnosed with ADHD. I also have general anxiety disorder and some days I just feel like I'm a functioning depressed person. I always have the chatter in my brain. I feel chronically fatigued.

"Hi, I am struggling with pimple and the worst hyperpigmentation possibly someone could ever have. I always try not to see my self through mirror(cause of insecurity).

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with me, I cried yesterday, and I am turning 25 tmr. I must be happy.
I have a perfect full time job in IT, the best family possibly someone could ever have, best health, but just because of my face I am so scared of everything and forgetting my other best thing.
I tried to kill myself last year, but got fail. Police showed up and took me to emergency ward. I don‚Äôt fill confident around people, I have a crush but never talk to her cause of my face. I am super alone but not by choice it‚Äôs cause of my face.

Nowadays I always come back to the saying ‚ÄúComparison is the thief of joy‚Äù. Take a step back and ask yourself if really the loneliness you experience could be alleviated by having a romantic partner? If not then I‚Äôd recommend doing things you find to be good for you outside of being involved romantically. Take part in things you know you enjoy, had once enjoyed, or have a keen interest in partaking whatever that may be. That is a very good start. Also hang out more with your friends if you have some in mind. Build deeper bonds with them if you‚Äôd like. I‚Äôve benefitted greatly from hanging out and bonding with my small circle of friends. I can‚Äôt say I know the kind of loneliness you‚Äôre going through yearning for a partner but I‚Äôve experienced/am experiencing the worst kind of loneliness there is in my life right now.

"Unsure if you‚Äôre in HS or College now. I dealt with immense feelings of loneliness and frequently wanted somebody to share my experiences with. Always had buddies telling me how different it was than a friendship and how great sex is.

Didn‚Äôt happen until my senior year but in my book it was 100% worth the wait. Most of your buddies‚Äô relationships will likely not last, if they‚Äôre also around 18. People are immature and often don‚Äôt have the ability to work through their relationship in a productive manner at that age imo. You‚Äôve got so much time and waiting is ok :).

Have you ever slept on the floor? Really. Not talking about camping here. Cement or wood underneath. When I was a kid, I remember it. On family gatherings, once or twice a year, we got the last spot. No air mattress. Just a blanket and pillow. I don‚Äôt remember it as bad. I remember it as fun.

I've been trying to do this more because my mattress is really bad. There's like a huge dent in the middle of it and I always wake up with back pain. I don't find sleeping on the floor that bad but my lower back does get bruised. Or that area right above my butt crack. I probably just need a little bit more padding and I should be fine.

"I feel kind of vulnerable and slightly embarrassed to share this but I will anyway.
On a morning while listening to Sparks by Coldplay I laid in bed. I was having flashbacks of when I was younger of moments where I felt unsafe. Moments of where someone fault me for things that wasn‚Äôt my fault. Moments of where I was being yelled at for something simple. Moments of when a traumatic event was occurring. During each flashback I imagined and placed Me, this adult I am now, running to her hugging that version of me. Allowing her to express how she felt . While hugging myself in real life in bed crying.  The thought of just hugging the younger version of me brings me comfort in a way that feels so safe and healing. I haven‚Äôt accomplished every goal I have yet, I make ends meet , but one thing I know for sure is that I‚Äôve become the person I needed when I was younger. The person I am now is the person I would have felt safe with as a kid. Not giving up on myself now is not giving up on little meüê£ ‚Ä¶anyway thank you for the taking the time to read this I‚Äôm not one express this out loud too often. But I felt like many people relate to wanting to run to a younger version of them self letting them know that they‚Äôre going to be ok. having a picture of little you and carrying it with you can also help with some everyday choices. Also I just wanted to share because this is my method of comfort for days that I feel low, just like every city uses different colors and different signs or decorations , different patterns on stairs or walls, or traffic lights, different architecture designs or similar inspired ones (because we‚Äôre all creative) the goal is the same to climb up or down, give directions or follow them for guidance or to simply just look at to acknowledge to understand. 

I didn‚Äôt know what mental health meant or self love. I wasn‚Äôt aware of any of those terms until I was 20 years old. 20 year old me had an overwhelming time accepting and grieving everything.  It truly is a different lens‚Ä¶ years later I‚Äôm still grieving and working on unhealthy habits..it takes time a practice,a lot energy when sometimes I have none but just gotta keep trying.

They convinced me to tell someone and I tried to tell my mum like 10 minutes ago but I woke her up and I couldn't talk. I told er that I needed help but the words wouldn't come out of my mouth. She got pissed at me because I woke her up. So I didn't tell her. But I tried so hard to. 

I thought she would be patient with me but she wasn't and she I couldn't tell her anything. But I will be fine for now.

Is there another adult in your life that you trust and can open up to? Perhaps someone inside the mental health field? I‚Äôm sorry your mom reacted the way she did and invalidated your feelings AND I‚Äôm also happy you were able to talk through some of the other thoughts.

"Your mum probably isn‚Äôt aware of what is going on so she was most likely annoyed that you woke her up but didn‚Äôt say anything.

I (15) think I was abused.

I don‚Äôt know what to do from here, I don‚Äôt know how to heal I don‚Äôt know how to deal with all of this I‚Äôm just scared. 

As a kid I was spanked by my parents screamed at in my face for pointless things by them, they took away my dinner as a punishment, they made fun of me, if I was upset I would be filmed and my parents would show it to me because I was ‚Äúacting ridiculous‚Äù, if I started to cry my parents would yell at me and tell me they didn‚Äôt want to hear it (told me to stop or go to my room)

 I was terrified of my parents. I used to run up to my room if I got in trouble because I was scared of what would happen. I would cower in a corner of my room and wait for my dad to come stomping up the stairs ready to yell at me. I had nightmares of them doing the same thing.

"If you are an only child, you might be at the receiving end of parents not knowing how to be parents.

As a child, I felt the same way and I didn't know how to communicate it or know the right questions to ask.

As a parent, I also felt the same way because I didn't know how to communicate or know the right things to say or questions to ask. It's all really about communication.

I'd bring up that you want to schedule your routine medical exam if you have one, and mention possible counseling (either for yourself or as a family) and/or mention the behavior neutrally to a school representative and ask for advice from a trusted person there.

Some of the biggest things I learned:

If they are asking you to do something, and you don't know how to do it or don't understand what it is there are asking, just ask them upfront. ""You asked me to do this, so does that mean x,y,z?""

Their behavior is not your fault, and it doesn't mean they are bad people.

Tone and body language are 99% of the conversation, they see yours and you see theirs, try to learn what yours looks like to them and try to explain to them what theirs look like, even ask them if you think something is on the horizon.

"Hey Mike, I am not a professional or have any training in regards to psychology, mental health, or suicide. However, you very clearly stated that ***You don't want to die, you just want the pain to go away.***

I very intimately know the difficulty of straining every ounce of energy in my body just to keep moving on. It's disheartening to see other people living so freely, when every moment feels like you're suffocating. I'm not going to say anything like ""Life gets better"", since like, fuck if I know what you're going through. What I'll instead ask you, is Can life get any worse? When I was staring down the proverbial barrel earlier in my life, the mindset that ended up changing the trajectory of my life is ""I can kill myself anytime. I can do whatever the absolute hell I want, and kill myself if it doesn't work out. I can live my life like I've already died"". I then proceeded to a laundry list of dumb shit and live my life in a way that truthfully, I'm not entirely proud of for a few years. However, those years were instrumental in me gaining insight and knowledge of living, and finding a way to make a purpose in life. After gaining those core values and experiences, I now had gained something that I didn't want to lose, and gradually started wanting to die less and less. Now, I don't even want to die at all, which might sound like it's not much of an achievement, but I'm very proud of my progress.

&#x200B;

There was a time for me where there really wasn't anything worth living for, there was no joy in my entire body, and thinking about dying was the only thing that brought me any comfort. Now, I can find genuine joy in the everyday mundane. I'm not going to say ""Life gets better"". I think saying that is pointless. I believe it to be true, but hearing those words always pissed me right the hell off. I don't give a fuck if life gets better, I just want to be happy. If you feel the same way, I implore you to reach out for help (or start your villain arc, whichever feels like it makes more sense for you). That's why I'm still here.

My dad was abusive to both of us, my mom mainly to me. I have 2 boys: one is 26 and one is 16. My oldest has asked several times about why I‚Äôm treated differently by my mom and my youngest asks me why my parents say I was such a horrible teenager but won‚Äôt tell any stories about me but will about my sister.  I‚Äôve explained to both of them the answer.  I spent my entire life knowing that my mom never wanted me, I ruined her life at conception.  I‚Äôm finally old enough and strong enough to walk away from these people. Yet I‚Äôm still the problem as my entire family is concerned (except 1 aunt).  I‚Äôve been yelled at by a cousin for ‚Äúgetting her Uncle in trouble‚Äù and he is a wonderful man that would never do what I accused him of.  To be clear, I never went outside my household with any accusations.  I could have ruined both of their reputations and possibly costs them their livelihood if I did.  There are a lot of things to unpack so I can‚Äôt get all of it in.  However; my biggest issue since my dad sobered up has been his controlling behavior.  This is what got us into a fight in Nov.  He has texted me since trying to make me understand that he‚Äôs tried to make up for the past for all of these years.  So, I wrote him a 13 page letter trying to explain that I actually have forgiven him for the past (when I was a kid), but his and mom‚Äôs continued narcissistic behavior towards me is the true problem.  I‚Äôve made it clear that I don‚Äôt want to speak to either of them until they have went back to counseling (or in my mom‚Äôs case to start counseling).  Now my youngest son feels like he‚Äôs been out in the middle because I‚Äôm not willing to talk to his grandparents.  Every time I think about contacting my dad to attempt to meet in public to talk I start stressing out, sometimes to the point of making myself sick.  I‚Äôm back to going to Al-Anon meetings for support and clarity.  It‚Äôs definitely helping but I still freak out when I think about sitting down with him and talking.  Thanks for letting me rant and get this out of my head.	No-Assumption1298	post	25.679832591522008	female	White	0.9962816834449768	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

I‚Äôve let the memory and replay of my abuse control my life.  My cousin molested me when I was 6.  I had never told anyone until high school.  The way my secret was exposed was possibly just as traumatic.  My mom found a notebook which I wrote about what happened.  She approached me at 16 and I was so infuriated that she violated my privacy, it gets worse.  Her and my dad don‚Äôt really talk about it with me.. then a week or so later I come home from school and my abuser is sitting in my living room..  he came to ‚Äútalk‚Äù‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm assuming my parents thought this was helpful- god no!!!  So he said basically I don‚Äôt remember this happening but I was young and stupid and I‚Äôm sorry if something did happen.  I pretended to forgive him and then spent the next year feeling awkward and alone and in denial of my own truth.  I‚Äôm now 38 and I am struggling with depression and anxiety and I still think of this every day. I just hope that if anyone else ever finds out that their child has been abused they will talk to them and find them the proper care and help. I have lettuce so it ruined my life and I‚Äôm still trying to get better. So angry that I let myself become this shell of a person. Ive have learning disabilities growing up and it has majorly affected my education and career. I used to have so many goals and aspirations and now I am just so tired and feel like I e failed in overcoming this so now it‚Äôs just swallowing me up.  it has taken such a tole, keeping a secret, wanting to tell someone, wanting help.. wanting to forgive my parents for how they thought was the best way to deal.

"I don't think you've ""let"" your trauma control your life. No one gets to choose how trauma affects them. You have done your best. 

You don't owe anyone forgiveness for the past. You went through a series of violations.

 *Acceptance* is for you, not anyone else. It doesn't mean you need to forgive. It doesn't mean you condone the damage done. What it can do is help you release some of your suffering.

"Hey u/Sir_Vdam999 , I saw your comments you had in response to u/bluesky1742 , and would like to kindly suggest you search out resources in your area. I won't give you any sweet words like ""things get better"", or ""life is worth living"", or anything vague and empty in meaning to you, since I don't know you. I don't know the life you're living - and even if I did, who am I to tell you how to live your life.   


However, as someone who has come face to face with suicide twice and has continued living since, I can confidently say I've been improving my life since. Shit isn't easy, and it probably won't get much easier, but I'm finding reasons to life and shit to do with my life. Again, your life not mine, and I'm not going to convince you to change your ways, and I certainly don't intend to have a discussion or argument on the pros and cons of not committing suicide. When I was staring down the proverbial barrel, its because I didn't want to hurt anymore, and I wanted to escape the pain that felt like it would last forever. If you're running from something right now, running from pain, running from guilt, running from anything, then why not face that fear before you choose to end it all. What do you have to lose.  


Sorry if this was a harsh way of putting all this, but we aren't suicide watch. We aren't therapists, not professionals of any manor. We're just a peer support group. I'm telling you all this as a person, talking to you as another person. I recommend you seek proper help, because while I won't say ""Life will get better"", I will say that there is a significant chance your life can still improve. Goodluck out there, stay safe."

"Yesterday I did pretty well. Today, as I was exercising on the elliptical, it came up again.

I was watching television-which I rarely do because so very many things set me off-remind me of things. Not even necessarily bad things...just things in general.

Anyway, there was a guy on TV who reminded me so much of my first husband-the one who was emotionally abusive-that my brain felt like it instantly went back to a place where I felt helpless and hopeless. Then, there was something else on TV and it reminded me of my grandparents, which reminded me of the horrible church I grew up in and again, how hopeless and helpless I felt.

So in a span of just a few minutes, my brain somehow was transported to two different places where I felt very alone, abused or ignored. But mainly absolutely helpless, with everything outside of my locus of control.

But it didn't stop there. At that moment, I looked around me and saw various reminders of time gone by--the time when I was taking care of my grandmother before she died, the dishes on the wall my partner and I used for holidays to entertain my grandmother and my aunt. The table centerpiece which was at my grandparents' house for years. The curtains I carefully chose for our new home (my partner's and mine). On and on--reminders of several lifetimes that are gone, and no longer exist.

Not only am I not the person who lived those lifetimes anymore, but all the people who were there with me are gone.  So it feels like that was some kind of weird dreamworld that I can't relate to anymore...and because my partner is gone (at least intermittently), it feels as if I have no future, either. So all of the things around me that I see every day are reminders of a world that no longer exists, a person I no longer am (not that I know exactly who that is anymore, to be fair). And it feels like some weird ""otherworld"" like in Silent Hill (I've made that connection to panic attacks before, how when it happens, it feels like when the reality shifts in that video game/movie). 

In my last derealization post, I'd said I feel kind of like a ghost caught in a realm where I can still see things, people, places, but I can't appropriately interact with people or the environment. I think what I just described is why. The disconnect to the world around me, based on items from a very brief lifetime ago, is why. The feeling that I have nothing in front of the years ahead is why. The realization that the life I had, not very long ago, is gone, is why. And all of this...combined with the fact that I can't simply move on, but must continue to be here, or work at my grandparents' house, or care for various things for a lifetime that is long gone, is disorienting at times.

I think this is definitely the root of my most recent dissociative episodes. Now, the trick is to figure out how to not allow it to control me."	mrsheartbroken	post	28.27272605008196	female	White	0.9956619143486023	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

"My mom had a stroke 3 days after the most insane family torment on Dec 17 2022. 
In hindsight, our family planned a fake Christmas get-together. My mom and I and my husband were mobbed by our family for sport. It was mean vicious and cruel.
My mom forgot names, and I watched my young nephews being encouraged by adults to yell at her viciously that she forgot their names. 3 days later, she had her stroke.
I just want my mom back. She is not the same. She forgets to call now. She doesn't remember anything.
i found my Christmas present, and I remembered how purposeful and thoughtful she was when she saw us open it that night.
Because her neighbor took her to the ER and didn't call anyone,  she didn't get meds i  her golden hour.

"Lemmie put this to you bluntly: *Not enough time has passed yet for you to know how things will turn out.*

I had my strokes Dec 14, 2015. I got out of the hospital Feb 16, 2016, and everyone thought I had an insanely short time in the hospital. Even when I got home, I was definitely not the same. My boyfriend left me. My friends were all kind to me, but they knew I wasn't the same. My father and aunt were good to me, but they also knew I was not the same. Most of all, *I* knew I was not the same.

I didn't just have the ""forgets to call"" problem, I had the ""can barely hold the phone long enough to call"" problem and the ""can barely stay awake long enough to call"" problem and the ""can barely remember *how* to call"" problem. My memory was also not functioning correctly, and I knew it. I'd repeat myself often to friends, and I'd think ""I'm repeating myself,"" but not until I was almost done.

Around about 10 months after the stroke, a friend told me that he thought I had achieved ""normality"" in that he could no longer tell, talking to me, that I wasn't myself. *I* could tell, but *he* couldn't. And this was with pretty extraordinary effort. It's kinda like a duck - you see it effortlessly gliding across the surface of the water, while what you can't see is that its feet are paddling like mad to make it happen. People see me being me, they don't see all the effort my brain puts into making it happen.

8 years later, *I* can still tell. Some friends can *sometimes* tell. You wouldn't be able to tell.

Your mother's stroke was 2 months ago. Some stroke patients aren't even awake yet by 2 months. She needs support and care and therapy and time.

By the way - you tried to explain what your family did and strongly imply that this caused the stroke. While it probably didn't help, what would be more accurate is to say ""their last memory of her before the stroke will be their cruelty."" Bad experiences don't cause strokes to occur several days later. (Immediately, *maybe*, but in that case more likely the person was a stroke waiting to happen and the bad experience pushed them over the edge.) Also, it's not entirely clear from your description what happened, other than that they were rude about it."	lootsincombat	reply	na	na	na	0.9953904151916504	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

So, I was heavily depressed and I spent a lot of time getting my head fixed by doctors and meds, now Im feeling much better but still not as great as I used to be. I took an academic leave, but since I had not passed some examinations I had to take an additional course which started in the begining of February. I have a lot of time on my hands, but I can't just bring myself up and get myself to study. I used to be very productive, I used to memorise 50 pages worth of lecture notes per day. Now I can't even memorize 20. I feel crippled and I am falling behind in my studies. I dont know if that's because of my meds or because I had a big gap in studying. But I have to start studying now or I might end up expelled.

I talked to my mom about this she doesn‚Äôt always give the best advice but it helped me. The brain is like a muscle and you have to work it to get better and smarter and able to pay attention longer and be more productive. Like if u got a sports injury and doctors had to work on you when u went back to working out your muscles wouldn‚Äôt be as strong and u wouldn‚Äôt be able to lift as much weight or do as much as u could before. Sorry if this analogy sucks ass but like comparing yourself to your past self doesn‚Äôt help anything just try to be better than yourself now.

Going step by step could be a great option - attempt dividing your studies into tinier parts and concentrating on one job every time. That manner, you can steadily increase your assurance and you'll find yourself productive again. Also don't forget about taking some time for yourself and doing activities that make you feel great. With some patience and effort you can be back in the same place you were before.	NotRealPerson1805	reply	na	na	na	0.9976366758346558	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
Ty all for your support and advice. I understand that it takes time to get back to normal, but I have to be productive asap, because my first examination is next week. Of course, I'll have more than one attempt, usualy no one passes on the first time, cause, you know, med uni, but I am still far behind and I have to get a lot of lecture material into my head the sooner the better	NotRealPerson1805	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9976366758346558	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

"I‚Äôm currently in a trio right now and it‚Äôs causing me so much pain right now. I genuinely care about them and I think they care about me too but I feel constantly left out. 

They were friends a year before I became friends with them. They are really really close and I don‚Äôt want to hurt their friendship in any way. 

I don‚Äôt want to leave bc I‚Äôll have no other friends and I do really like them. We have the same interests and I feel like I can be myself with them.

They invite me to hang out with them but when I do I feel like a third wheel a lot and I know they‚Äôve excluded me a couple of times and it really really hurt. 

This is hurting my mental health right now and I feel so alone right now.

"Just know that I am saying this with a lot of emotion. Strong emotions that I have.

I weighed 300 pounds. During the pandemic all I did was study. I talked to no one. Before the pandemic I was so fit. I looked so good. 

I wanted the old me back. I made a consistent effort to be healthier. I did everything in my power. It was like climbing a mountain. And I did it all! I became fit again! I am starting to look good great. 

And 7 months ago, I found a job that pays me 19.50 an hour. Not too bad. But it's still just a typical customer service job. I am a 30 year old dude and I feel like I don't fit in sometimes. It could be my own thoughts and I could be wrong about all of that.  I do my best to talk to other co workers there, I had some genuine conversations, but for the most part, it just feels repetitive and empty. I don't feel like I always fit in. The job isn't stressful but I yearn for something more fulfilling some days like today. I just don't know what it is. Sometimes I research a job as a social worker, because I want to help people. I always cared about societal problems, anthropology and the working class. When I studied sociology and psych in community college, it was all I was interested in. I love reading books on my own about it as well on my free time.

 Sometimes when I get off of work I look at a job as an electrician, but I am never completely certain. I hear a lot of awful things about certain jobs. Like social worker you are overworked and underpaid. Electrician just seems grueling to as hell to me. It's physically and mentally draining. But I also heard that people love it in a lot of ways. It's sad but I can honestly never really decide what I want. It's always been a problem I had. I majored in Computer Science in my younger 20s and dropped out later on. I got my associates in psychology. But then when I was trying to get my bachelor's, I  dropped out Psychology   because of a lack of resources. During the pandemic I felt like I couldn't get the assistance I needed or go to the teacher during office hours or ask a fellow classmates. I just played video games because I couldn't deal with the isolation. And now I am here I guess. It's my own fault I know.

I have been seeking a therapist but to no avail. Sometimes I journal. I pretend like the person listening to me is someone who truly loves me and has my best interest at heart. What would that even look like? I wonder.

I feel like I improved in so many ways. I improved socially, physically, mentally. I can see it. Sometimes I compare my pandemic self to who I am now. I feel like I've come so far. I am slim, I have long hair now for some reason, I have a good muscle tone. I look in the mirror and love who I am. I just feel like society doesn't recognize all of my great qualities a lot of the time. 

But then again, I feel like most people don't understand me or where I am coming from. There is a lot of my life, a lot of moments, parts, bits and pieces that make me who I am, that no one will ever understand but myself and all of what I've been through and what is going on inside my brain. I just want to be somewhere I belong. A happy place of friends my age I can relate to, fun activities to look forward to, a fulfilling job that pays well, and a sense of meaning. Yet, all I really have is a Trader Joe's job, physical and mentally health improvement, and enough to live in a single apartment by myself. I have loneliness and video games on my free time basically. That's it. No friends, nothing else.

It just all gets so lonely at times. I wish I had more. I feel like I will never figure out this out. Any path I choose, I get discouraged or uncertain. 

Sorry for the long rant. I doubt anyone will actually read all of this. But thank you if you did put in the time to read this and try to understand."	LizzSaldana94	post	21.05293563607059	male	White	0.9915564060211182	na	na	na	4	MentalHealthIsland

"I don't have answers but I relate so much to what you've said.
I feel I've done so much work to be the person I wanted to be, overcome so much, I tuck all the boxes and do all the self care and all the work to fit into the world and get on.
It never seems to be enough. there's always the feeling of not belonging and yearning for meaning.
I'm resigned to being alone because as much as I do want a place I fit in, and feel comfortable, it seems like a never ending task to find and maintain and the work doesn't feel worth it anymore.

I'm generally at peace, I have a decent job that a like, and plans to re-train and build myself up self employed, I have a small rented flat and it's not the best but not the worst, I have hobbies I enjoy. I just can't seem to break into actually living life. I feel I'm just here, moseying along, and waiting for it to be over.

"Thanks for sharing you two. 

If I may pass on a bit of wisdom from similar feelings and counselling others: 

1. First, recognize the hard self work you  already done, thank yourself and be grateful. Many others are in far worse shape.

2. There are many ‚Äòsuccessful‚Äô hard working people that experience the same emotions. This is because you can‚Äôt work yourself out of loneliness. You have to engage and love others. The best way to do this is search out others with similar interests  and passions and commune with them. 

3. Much of our post modernist angst comes from too much self- analysis - which we think is the answer- and not enough helping or serving others. To have meaning find meaning in serving others. When others recognize your value to them, not to yourself, you will see their gratitude, feel value in yourself and be more fulfilled. These are not empty platitudes but rather experiential from a life time of trying to help others. 

4. Be happy in the small things in life rather than fantasizing about the future and what it might hold. Dreams are good but taking joy from every day simple pleasures is more tangible. 

5. And understand that others do truly care even it is an anonymous Redditor üòä

"For the past 3 days I've been having some really intense derealization-Jamais Vu type stuff.  Nothing around me-even in my own home-feels ""right"" or familiar. I had to fight against throwing everything out today because the feeling of absolute disconnect to my belongings was so strong.   


I've had it before with anxiety...especially ""covert"" panic attacks that don't present as a typical panic attack, but rather manifest in dissociative ways. But it hasn't happened in a long time.   


Nothing, no one, no place, feels safe. I've been living in this weird state that feels like it's somewhere between reality and a nightmare since I first tested negative for Covid Sunday. The best way I know how to describe it is...imagine if you suddenly found yourself dead, but you weren't gone-your spirit or whatever were still around, lingering. You can see the world around you, your loved ones...but you can't really interact with anything or anyone. Imagine how disorienting and confusing that would be.   
That's the best way how to explain how I feel, although it's not depersonalization exactly... I don't know. It's hard to explain. I just want to feel mentally normal again, even if it's my usual anxious/depressed state."	mrsheartbroken	post	20.862272745434936	female	White	0.9949553608894348	na	na	na	4	MentalHealthIsland

"I am 17 F and even my ex is 17. We were classmates for 2 years but never really spoke to each other. He texted me after 3 years in October 2022 and we got close. He was out his relationship of two years with a girl who was elder than him. They had a on and off relationship going on and he told me she was 4 years elder to him. His ex ghosted him for a few months and then suddenly she was loving for a few days and back to ghosting. A few days later he told me she was 7 years elder.

We soon started dating towards the end of October. Not even a week into our relationship and I found out that he lied to about his ex. His ex was 11 years elder than him and she was one of my very closest friends. I've known her for 3 damn years as she was our mutual friend's step sister. I mentioned about her many times during our situationship stage and told him about how much I respected her.  He apologized to me and I forgave him. He told me that she was cheating on her bf with him. He used to get her a lot in our convos but I shrugged it off thinking that he was just opening up about his past.

But guilt was eating me up somewhere. I've known her for 3 damn years and she was there for me at my lowest moments. I wanted to cut off ties with her and admit the truth to her. I told him that I will text her up and confess it out. He agreed. I confessed it out to her and apologized. But she reacted in a very furious way. She asked me to tell him to text her. He did text her. I saw their chats as I had his password. She told him that she still loves him and me seem like a hoe who sleeps around with many guys. He told her stuff like ""I love you"" ""You are my fav always"". When I asked him why he was doing that, he told me that he was ""sugarcoating"" her as he wanted to be sweet to her cause she was a harm to us.

After that incident I told him that I was hurt. He apologized to me and I forgave him. A few days went by and he took me to his home. His parents knew about us and they were much fine with our relationship. He introduced me to his mom and that day we had a lot of physical intimacy. The same day he left me over a phone call telling his parents weren't fine with us. Nothing made sense to me. His mom was legit telling me to come over for lunch in the morning and he stated that reason in the evening. He blocked me on social media.

I spent 3 weeks begging his friends to ask him to text me at least once for one last time. He didn't text me. One of his friend talked to him and me that he didn't want any ""distractions"" in life. I decided to drop a final text on his number a week back and leave it. He replied to it immediately telling that he broke up cause he wasn't over his ex. We had a last phone call and he told me that he ""let me down slowly"" cause he didn't wanna hurt me more. Told me that he didn't love me and thought that it was love but it wasn't. Told me that it was cause of me that the relationship ended. I didn't understand what my fault was. I texted her only cause I didn't wanna be consumed by guilt of dating her ex behind her back.

We said good byes. It hurt me a lot. I'm healing. I apologized to his ex and told her to forgive me if I came in between them. I wish nothing but the best for both. Even if they end up getting together in the future, I hope that they stay happy and blessed. Idk if I was the wrong one or the right one. He always told me he ""wanted"" me..Now it all makes sense. He needed her and wanted me. The big difference. I was just a rebound for him.

The thing which I don't understand is that he held me in his arms in the morning and talked to me about marrying me and having kids together. If he realized that he didn't love me, he could have dumped me before using my body...I was nothing to him but for me he will always be my first love."	illbuyflowerss	post	33.64725781908287	male	White	0.9884935021400452	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthIsland

"Ok, I'm probably going to go off topic again, sorry if I do.

So, I never been a person that feels hopeless. There are days where I feel scared. I feel scared when I can't fix an incredibly bad thing and I feel like it's my fault. I feel scared when I don't understand things. I feel scared when I felt like I have said something wrong or have an opinion. I just been feeling hopeless.

One of things that I learned to accept or at least trying to be that you can't always change someone's opinions. You can't always change how they feel. You wish can, but it's not really as simple as that. It's really up to them.

Another thing is that there will always be shitty people in this world. Trust me, the world is not perfect, no one is really, but the thing you don't need that type of stuff in your life and try to make sure less of that is in my life.

The real reason I'm writing this is that I just want to do the best I can. I just want to treat people with kindness and live my life to its fullest, but yet I feel like I'm worthless when I can't help people that are so far away or prevent a terrible incident.

So I‚Äôve felt incredibly guilty. Because I‚Äôve done many horrible things. Including had physical fights with my family many times and also had stuff that warrants being called sexual assault and even something that could be called predatory to a minor. Now all these things were done without intent to harm and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve wrestled with because I know I didn‚Äôt intend to be emotionally manipulative or predatory. That is what the actions ended up being though. but I didn‚Äôt understand the gravity of the situation. So even though there‚Äôs no warrant and also even though my family won‚Äôt press charges on me. And even though my incident that I call sexual assault has been downplayed by those around me. Also that I‚Äôm not attracted to minors. I feel the only correct form of action is to turn myself in.

it takes a lot to own up to your actions, be proud of yourself for that. that being said ima be real with you, you need to get help before something even worse happens. prison won‚Äôt help you, even though prison/jail is supposed to be ‚Äúrehabilitation‚Äù it‚Äôs obviously not. something that‚Äôs helped me a lot with my impulsive/destructive behaviors was DBT, it was made for ppl with borderline but it‚Äôs helpful for anyone. there are plenty of workbooks, therapists and programs that teach DBT skills, id seriously recommend checking it out. my other suggestion, if you feel like you‚Äôre likely to act out again and lack control is to check yourself in to a mental hospital. therapy is really helpful, and you won‚Äôt have the opportunity to make bad decisions. plus you might be able to get some more insight and resources. good luck dude	ZZE33man	reply	na	na	na	0.15816247463226318	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
"On Monday I had to go to emdr (as usual). On the way there, hesitantly asked my father to drive me there. I dont like asking, because the report usually goes along the lines of‚Ä¶ I dont amount to anything, so why should I be driven etc. On the way there we had an argument about my work situation. He basically drilled into me about how useless and lazy I am. I was sitting right next to him so its not like I had the opportunity to walk away. It triggered a severe c-ptsd flashback. The flashback was like a slideshow of terrorising noises and body sensations that I thought I had kept under raps; Of so I thought. 

4 days later and I‚Äôm a mess. Every inch of my being is telling me how useless and lazy I am. My c-ptsd is recalling SA.. Physical abuse.. Abandonment. I tried cutting again today but cowered out.

If you read the titles and hello, you may know me. I‚Äôve posted like five times I think already on this sub Reddit. I have just finished getting all my anger out on my poor wall so yay my knuckles are as red as a cherry and I‚Äôm still crying as I type this. I really don‚Äôt know why I continue to let people use me as a puppet people fear Mia people also think that it‚Äôs funny to mess around with my emotions. I‚Äôm just a teenager that wants to live a normal life I‚Äôm really try not to cuss rn cuz that‚Äôs all I have been doing since I got home to my room being a mess after a horrible day at school. I hate this house I hate everyone that lives with me the only thing I care about are my friends and my pets my relatives are a piece of shit and the only ones I like ether are too far away or dead. I just want to talk with someone and no one really cares about me anymore. It‚Äôs quite obvious. If the only things you‚Äôre gonna do is yell at me, lecture me and say you still care do you think that‚Äôs quite manipulative. I may come from a manipulative family and bloodline. I may be a little bit manipulative myself and I am a horrible person i know that at the most and that I have done some horrible things in the past but I‚Äôm trying to correct myself for what I have done. But not a single person really believes with me to separate. It is pretty much the last thing I have I have been going through the same family torture for years now since I was 3 years old. I know there‚Äôs people that have gone through worse than what I have gone through divorce people does not think that‚Äôs the reason why I don‚Äôt tell anyone I know or anyone that says they care about me about this. I have kept my pains, Ptsd etc. all to myself and I‚Äôm at a tipping point not really I have been a broken glass for a while now, I literally have scars all over my left arm from self harm and now I have band-Aids, keeping all the blisters from popping on my knuckles I am not okay so why do people still say I am. I‚Äôm just seeking support I guess but this really hurts especially because only a few days ago, I broke up with my girlfriend so yay I‚Äôm single on valentine‚Äôs Day‚Ä¶	FIN_1937	post	18.12701201401908	female	White	0.997367799282074	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

That's totally understandable - it can be tough to feel like you're missing out on something special when everyone else is celebrating. But you don't need to feel bad for not having a relationship, there is so much more to life than that.

"Every tiny thing is almost grating at my soul and making me so fucking angry. From reading my friends group chat and thinking what a bunch of horrible imbeciles to watching my usually favourite TV show and thinking how god awful the acting is and why am I wasting my time with this crap?

I don't feel like this often, maybe once every few weeks but it just comes on so suddenly and sporadically it's hard to know where it's come from. No, I don't think it's anything to do with my hormones or cycle, as it's not in any real pattern to put it down to that.

"I can relate to this so much. Your description of it is very good and I don't know what or why it is, either. It's weird how it just shows up out of nowhere but it did that this morning for me. I noticed it right away and faked a big smile that scared it off. It's funny how just moving those muscles sent a message to my brain.
I'm just guessing but I think it happens in part because almost everything we see or hear (especially lately) has this peppering of negativity, chaos, disparity and rage sadness (?). I don't really have any good advice but I hear & understand you for sure. I think it's awesome that you are aware of it when it shows up rather than just slipping into the river and going with its flow for the rest of your day. That's a great thing!

Hey! I've been dealing with something similar. I don't know if my circumstances are anything like yours,  but for months I would on and off get that horrible grating feeling. It feels out of character for me but I feel irritable and annoyed so easily even now. I eventually got blood work done just to check if anything was screwing with my hormones,  and it turned out to be an issue with my thyroid- specifically hyperthyroidism. Symptoms leading up to that were extreme irritability/anger, insomnia, faster than normal heart rate,  and intolerance to being too warm paired with heightened tolerance to being cold.  I couldn't tell you if what you're experiencing is linked to a similar cause,  but it might be worth it to get a blood panel done to check if there's anything biochemically screwing up your mental state.	midnightMushroom2	reply	na	na	na	0.9989092350006104	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

I've held down my current job for over a year. Finally found a job that works. I just find myself waking up everyday and the motivation is gone. I usually have a strict routine I follow, now it's a struggle to get out of bed. I'm going through the motions of life, but it just feels so robotic and pointless. I was a late diagnosis on the autism spectrum, and I also have ADHD. I used to frequent here before but forgot my login. Just mainly wondering what I can do to give myself more spoons for the day... because I have been starting work with zero and am psychically/mentally exhausted. To the point where everyone thinks I'm mad 24/7 because masking is just more stressful now than it used to be. It just seems that maybe I'm stressed out and it's heightening my sensory issues. Work has offered me to take time off, but with valentine's day Tuesday, I can't abandon my other kitchen mates. So maybe after that I can take a break to work on my hobbies. I'm just venting really. Possibly seeking advice on how to make it through the next few days until I can take some PTO and get this figured out with my therapist. I'm just trying to not push myself to into a meltdown or crisis mode.	Phillip-J-Fry94	post	17.36359111339663	female	White	0.9988477230072021	na	na	na	5	MentalHealthIsland

"Get your life force back, It feels like you are already burning down at this point. Kitchen is tough and personally, I don't think it can sustain an exciting life apart if you are really passionate about it and think it's your Dharma.

If you are indeed passionate, then It can be helpful to take a long break from it. The last thing you want is to become sour and lose your inner child into the abyss of your shadows.

You can ""*abandon*"" (I wouldn't use such a strong word) the company or restaurant you work for has to take responsibility for this. Better to save your other kitchen mates before it becomes out of control, and better to prevent than destroy.

If you like to write you could offer your services as a writer? There's plenty of people out there looking for writers for all kinds of projects.

Could turn your hobby into a profitable side venture without any pressure and eventually scale upwards at your own pace if you're enjoying it. 

If all goes well you could cut down your hours in the kitchen and maybe aim for a nice balance between the kitchen/writing that'll enable you to enjoy both without feeling like you need to rely one or the other. 

Give it some thought. the possibility of a new challenge, the idea of being paid for something you enjoy doing or the change of pace could be the solution.

"I am so sorry you went through that.

Shame really sucks.  I hate it so much‚Ä¶ I was reading from Patrick Teahan about how it can drive people to bully or give up against a bully‚Ä¶


What happens to the 5 year old bullied by the 12 year old?  It‚Äôs not fair; that 5 year old doesn‚Äôt have a chance.

Same applies if the bully is a parent.

We learn we can‚Äôt win (or we learn bullying is winning).

Anyway, sometimes I give up and hermit, and sometimes I eat the shame and continue forward anyway, even as it burns my heart.

I like the second approach because it lets me keep going, but I can only handle so much of it.

"This is tough for me because I was doing really well. Last week was the second week of my college courses and I had already had a perfect schedule on how I will be balancing my full time job and school. 

I use Saturdays to do all my studying and homework. Sundays I use to relax and maybe some more homework if I didn‚Äôt finish. 

My mom knows this. But since she doesn‚Äôt drive, she already had plans for me to drive my sister to a doctors appointment and then take her grocery shopping. Even though I knew I would be short on time for studying, I agreed.

My mom has bad anxiety with driving. And every little thing makes her freak out. She had already yelled at me about which way I was taking even though i was using a gps. I was driving and this car in the next lane was getting really close to the side of my car. She then started screaming again and made this disgusting comment about Spanish people because she assumed the lady driving was Spanish. I immediately called her out and I told her, can you please relax?? You don‚Äôt have to insult an entire race of people. How would you feel if someone called you a ‚Äústinking [insert race]‚Äù. 

Then she started getting angrier and screamed why am I insulting her because of other people, as a child I should never do that. She screamed at me the whole way. And then started to play the victim saying she‚Äôs not a bad person and she‚Äôs not crazy. 

Later she wanted me to drive her to the grocery store so I did even though I was still mad about how she acted. The whole way she would not stop talking . She continued to nitpick about my driving saying I‚Äôm going too fast even though I‚Äôm going the speed of traffic or just 5 / 10 above. Even the way back it was the same thing. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore so I said please stop talking to me. That made her angrier and she just bombarded me with insults and started tearing up. I just wanted to be out of the car. So I drove recklessly back her which made her angrier. 

I‚Äôm still super upset at what happened. I couldn‚Äôt focus on school. So spend the entire Saturday in bed and still with today. I have a big assignment due on Tuesday and haven‚Äôt even started. I feel really sick. I just want to disappear. This isn‚Äôt even the first time something like this has happened. It‚Äôs the millionth."

"I don't know how to unbelieve this, but I believe, based on signals I get from just doing social things, that in order to be a worthwhile human you need a lot of external validation and need to be striving for the exceptional. This weekend has been brutal.

* I'm in a *relationship(?)* but I'm not so convinced where I stand, I am not sure I'm truly worth being in a relationship as I am unconvinced that I measure up in terms of desireability. This leaves me with a sinking feeling of ""when will the other shoe drop"", in which case I will be devastated and have to consider I've lost my last chance to be worth anything and might need to consider options to end it.
* This weekend I received at *least four* input signals - two from a sitcom, one from a comment made about dating, one from a movie - that appearance and relationship status are **so very important** to determining your worth. How am I supposed to reconcile this with the rather unconvincing platitudes I get from therapy and other sources about ""everyone has inherent worth""? It's not consistent, precise and/or objective and so the latter statements are just not credible.
* I went out to dinner the three nights this week - and I have not kept up on my calorie restrictions and extreme workouts and am **very concerned** about gaining any weight. I work extraordinarily hard to keep my body in a shape that nobody would be able to case negative aspersions on me (aside from things I can't fix, like my short stature - which is a endless well of self-hatred). I have ""disordered eating"" - though I am fine with it, I think it's a regimen that serves well in pursuit of self worth. But this week I've fallen off, and that makes me feel bad about myself.
* When I've discussed the strategy of suicide with my therapist, there is an immediate tone of urgency - as if the suicide itself is bad, but I don't feel there is precise logic on this. A conclusion that suicide is an undesirable result doesn't seem to be fully fleshed out or supported by facts. For example, if I am worthless, why wouldn't suicide be a good solution?

I can't seem to build a solid logical foundation on which to determine my worth as a human and if I would be immune to any criticism through curing of flaws and making myself a person that would not be deserving of bullying.

I just can't seem to ever find a pathway to liking myself."		post	28.327283914886348	male	White	0.9989117383956909	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

"*Your value is inherent. It does not need to be earned *

The concept of earned value is one of the most toxic of all societal ills. As long as you place your worth on external validation, you will continue to be unhappy with yourself. 

My therapist says, ""We are human beings, not human *doings*."" 

You've placed unrealistic expectations on yourself that no one would be able to meet. No matter their success, everyone has insecurities. Even if you were to meet all your goals, the emptiness persists.  Overachievers like yourself run into this consistently. 

You are not deserving of your hatred. You cannot hate yourself into someone you can accept. You deserve the nurturing and kindness you would extend to anyone else.

I'm going to revisit my idea of using a picture of yourself as a toddler or young child  and reflect on whether you can attack and berate them in the same way you do your adult self. Literally have a physical or digital copy to look at.

You, like all of us, have within you that same child. We aren't taught to parent ourselves as adults. We're often not taught to validate ourselves as children. 

You're allowed to value yourself *as you are now.* You don't need to be more.

I know how hard it is to accept yourself as you are. I deal with similar self esteem issues and self hatred. It's difficult to rewrite the messages we've given ourselves for years. It's also doable. 

The people who care about you have a much clearer picture of you than you do of yourself, no matter how hard your mind may fight the concept.

"I get that ""everyone has worth"" can sound like a platitude. Have you considered that you may have been indoctrinated into a system of values that is both subjective and antiquated?  Most of the rest of us have been to some extent. 

Here's how I look at it. I adhere to the belief that everyone has value because I refuse to contribute to a toxic ideology that some people are just inherently ""worth"" more than others. The greatest challenge is accepting that we, ourselves, are deserving of the same grace."		reply	na	na	na	0.9989117383956909	no	strong	strong	na	MentalHealthIsland
"I dated my boyfriend for five months. And throughout the relationship we had mostly our rough time. He is a game addicted and would spend hour on game without paying me any attention. And he do drugs. He has short hot temper and anger issue. On January, I decided to break up with him once because I couldn‚Äôt handle it. But then his mom come to talk to me, and talk some sense into me, and ask me to be back with him. And yeah I did. And then they all start to plan about marriage out of the blue. They give me pressure about getting marriage within this year. I mean I just know him for five month! 
They even go on on not wanting me to apply for a scholarship to study abroad, while asking me to go work with them, and gonna do a house chore. 
I feel super uncomfortable when his mom comment to me regarding my scar and the fact that I wear short in public, saying I should wear something long. I have big scar on my legs, and it took me ages to overcome my insecurities and body acceptance. And here she is trying to save her face by saying I should wear something long. She even comment if I go to work with her, i need to wear long while everyone else can wear short. 
After the trip, I decided to break up with him the second time. I cry my eyes out because I feel very disrespectful."	OKIEDAYO	post	15.890864445669184	female	White	0.9992278814315796	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

"Hi, 

I'm so glad you broke up with him the first time. I'm not sure if you want support and or advice. So, I'll add my observations about your situation instead? Perhaps another perspective might help you. 

You are dating an addict, any reasonable partner would break it off. Addiction is a deal breaker, as it should be. Addicts are almost always in denial and until there is admission of the problem on their part and demonstrated behaviour change, there is no point in staying. In fact, staying in the relationship can be enabling. Speaking of enablers, his mother is a problem. Your bf has not changed and he will likely never change if you stay. 

The mother has raised this addict and she has her sights on you now. It seems obvious she wants to control you, and exploit your labour for personal/family gain. This family is toxic and dangerous to you. 

Regarding the clothing and scars. I'm glad you found personal acceptance and worked so hard to establish your self esteem. Keep at it. Please avoid anyone who asks you to go backwards in your personal growth. That's what I see happening here with him and his mom. 

Prioritizing this amazing opportunity to study abroad is such a gift to you. Don't pass it up, not only will this offer you a brighter future, the life experience and the joy of travel and education... please don't let someone talk you out of it FOR ANY REASON. 

You owe them nothing. You don't owe them your time, labour, marriage or otherwise. You are worthy of your own life independence. 

Also, it was not 'talking sense' to convince you to go back to your bf who is an addict. His behaviour hurts you and diminishes your joy. How it it sensible to go back to that? It's not. 

It's sensible to stay away from his mother and the bf. Give yourself time alone to think without the influence of her or anyone on that family. 

Please take your own time and take the opportunity to break away from what is certainly an unhappy and abusive future with this family. 

You can do better. It's ok to go away and it's ok to be single and wear shorts and feel joy! Education is amazing and you're being offered a great opportunity.

"Me (M18) and my friend (F18) have been friends for about a year now. Back in July, we would call on the phone for hours each day, and talk all the time. We hugged almost everyday, and showed each other we cared about each other a lot. Buying things, making cards, all that stuff. We had this connection I couldn‚Äôt let go of. I thought about them all the time, and got excited whenever I did. We were/are each other‚Äôs best friends.In November, things started to change. I started to lose that feeling (which I think was platonic attraction) towards them. I started to talk less throughout the rest of the month. It didn‚Äôt matter too much then, until late November the feeling was completely gone. I then became suspicious I was really their best friend, and became jealous of every time they hugged or spent time with someone else, I felt bad. Early December I was struggling. I felt as if I was being punched in the stomach constantly, and it wouldn‚Äôt go away. Every time she was nice to me, it didn‚Äôt mean that much. I felt like she didn‚Äôt appreciate the things I did anymore. We stayed in contact over the holidays, and I still felt horrible. I barely could hold a conversation with them anymore.It felt like a chore talking to them, so starting early January, I stopped talking to them. I cut myself off for about 20 days, and during those days I got a lot better. My stomach didn‚Äôt feel as bad, and I stopped worrying.I texted them near the end of January, and they were just happy that I was okay. This made me a lot better, but it was short lived. I never felt good around them like I used to. When I got to seeing them for the first time in a while, on the way there I got suddenly more and more sick again. I felt almost as bad as I was back in early December.When I got there, I didn‚Äôt feel that connection, and wanting to hug them like I used to. It was new there where I realised what I might have been going through. Fear of abandonment. This would explain the stomach pain, jealousy, and worrying. I cracked down on this until I felt as good as new. I felt like nothing had happened, besides my inability to communicate well.Since we saw each other again we barely hugged at all. It felt like we were two different people in real life, and online. When we texted, we would always say nice things, and have meaningful conversations. When we were in person, they just felt like any other friend. Maybe it‚Äôs because we‚Äôre alone online in a one on one situation instead of in a group, but I don‚Äôt know.I noticed they felt much more empathy to their other friend, and It got me thinking about us. I didn‚Äôt think too much about it, as I realise it might just be my possible fear of abandonment.I decided to talk them about this, and they understood, but they didn‚Äôt act like anything had even happened when I saw them the next day. Then something snapped. They were having a hard time, so I told them it would be okay, I‚Äôm here for you, etc. I asked if they wanted a hug, because we hadn‚Äôt In a while, but they said no.It‚Äôs the first time they‚Äôve ever said no, and I got taken aback a bit. I respect their boundaries and all, but they hug their other friend who isn‚Äôt even as close as I am, but why not me? I feel like they don‚Äôt feel the same way about me as they used to, and that I‚Äôm not their best friend anymore, even if they say I am. I‚Äôm not sure what to say or do to try and improve the relationship if I even can.

TLDR: Me and my friend‚Äôs relationship isn‚Äôt the same as it used to be, and I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre l my best friend anymore, because they don‚Äôt act like they are."	Polar-3322	post	17.678534321210694	male	White	0.9967765212059021	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

"If you were feeling jealous or upset when they hugged someone else, (and my initial reaction is) the attraction wasn't platonic. The reason I think you're upset is because you feel like that other person might replace you as your best friend's favorite person. 

It's understandable as friends to feel bad if they hug another friend but not you. That's being left out, so it feels bad. My guess is when you told them how you were feeling, they picked up that the attraction or attachment was not platonic and so they're trying to gently put space in the relationship.

"Hi there, Mrsheartbroken (btw username checks out)

Lol, awful jokes aside, I just wanted to let you know that, despite how hopeless you may feel, there are always people out there who are willing to help you with your situation and are absolutely eager to put a smile on your face. I know what it's like battling loneliness because I've had my fair share of that in the past. It's definitely not a fun place to be in life, and I understand how, due to loneliness, our ever racing self -defeating thoughts makes our minds 'foggy' and 'clouded', making it especially hard to see the bigger picture exactly when we need it the most. It's completely natural for us humans to view our situation as the absolute worst one, and that no one else has it as bad as us, and that people will never be able to understand what we're going through, but rest assured, no matter how messed up your situation is, no matter how hard and difficult the battle is, there is ALWAYS a bright light at the end of the tunnel. Nothing lasts forever. This is just a brief period of time you're going through, and with proper help and support, it can be made even briefer. That's the most important thing to remember, that help is always available. People that genuinely care about your well being are always there and always eager to help you.

I'm here for you, both through the good and bad times in life. Feel free to reach out and have a chat whenever you feel like it :)

P.S: I run my own community where we host talks on a daily basis. If this subreddit doesn't have an active talk, then you can join us over at r/InterestingTalks and have a chat with us over there.

"Tommarow is February 8 and it will mark 2 years since j got out if the hospital.  It has been bothering me but it didn't last year. But last year I had people distracting me. Knownim alone in a new school and just don't have any energy. This also bothers me so much because nobody has seen the pain I've been in since.  They thought I was ok.

Though I have let a guidance councilor knew some stuff about my mentel health. Told them about my anxiety and panic attacks.  I told him that I've been  in dark places before but never really told him other then that but I'm not gonna lie, I felt alot better when I left that office then I had jn a long time.

"We talk a lot about recognizing that we all have an inner child in this group. 

We're all navigating this world in grown up bodies with the same needs we had as children. Now we have appropriate social boundaries that we at try to least abide by. 

We often forget that we need to parent ourselves with the same kindness we would offer our own children or loved ones.

Doing that is difficult because we often think of our inner child as someone we outgrew. That makes it easy to let abusive self talk we think we deserve to run unchallenged.

Try this. Find a picture, if you have the ability, of yourself as a young child -- old enough to react to and understand what's being said, and young enough to be effectively defenseless. 

Now see if you can say the same things to that three-year-old or five-year-old child, while looking at their picture. 

They don't deserve that cruelty, and neither do you. The two of you are the same person.

You may find yourself feeling a more protective of that kid and shooting down those negative thoughts more easily.

I hope you do, because you deserve kindness."	roanwolf75	post	46.75031070042046	female	White	0.011123532429337502	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthIsland

I took a short break from cutting for about 2 weeks cause I had a doctors appointment and I didn't want anyone to notice. After that I started cutting again and now I feel like I have to cut at least once a day. I've started to bring a razor cutter everywhere I go, and I get the urge to cut at probably the worst places; work, school, in public, etc. I've cut up on my wrists, arms, and on the back of my right hand. I don't know how or when I might stop, probably won't stop for a little while. I'm not looking for help or advice or anything, just thought I needed to write about this somewhere.	sticks_04	post	21.969885597129135	male	White	0.992644190788269	na	na	na	6	MentalHealthIsland
"I used to feel this way.  One of the things i did that kind of helped was putting a rubber band on my wrist (i cut my arms) and i gave myself quite a pop when i wanted that sensation. It helped. 

Another thing i did was get a dermaroller thing.  It's a little wheel with sharp spokes used to help circulation to the face,  but the sharpness really helped me get ""the feeling"" without actual harm to my skin. 

I've since covered most of my scars with tattoos... you can see them in other posts here."	sticks_04	reply	na	na	na	0.992644190788269	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
"*trigger warning*

This is kinda long, but if my story may help, I'm sharing.

Can you write out how you're feeling when you get the urge and then when you're actually doing it?

In my experience, and I only cut a handful of times in the same area (carved something I saw in flashback into my arm, have scar), I always felt like I needed a release. There was too much emotion  and pain inside, and I felt cutting was the only way to let some of it out. 

I also felt relieved to be able to see the blood come out which visually represented the emotion and pain leaving my body. 

I haven't cut for maybe a a few years now (lost track). But, I do think about it occasionally. I still kinda get the urge, but it passes.

There's an exacto knife on my desk. It's one of the things I've used before. At one point, I thought about getting rid of every single thing that could possibly be used to cut myself. But...unless that's for a short period (like while in crisis) that's a bit ridiculous to me bc that removes daily objects I might need. 

So, I decided I would get rid of everything that wasn't a regular use item (loose razor blades) and keep others such as scissors, knives, and the exacto knife. Tbh I don't even need the exacto knife anymore, but I think I'm keeping it to remind myself of my strength.

I knew I must be able to control the urge to cut, while those objects were around. I'm not sure how, but I've done it. 

I should probably get rid of the exacto knife bc seeing it reminds me of cutting and brings up a slight urge when I'm stressed and see it, but...I look at it and the urge passes after a minute. Lol... maybe I'm keeping it as a souvenir of past road I've traveled. 

I used to keep plenty of gauze pads and stuff just in case I did cut. I wanted relief, not to bleed out if I accidentally hit a vein or something. 

I think it was a huge healing step to finally remove that stash of medical supplies for that purpose after not cutting for over a year. Keeping them felt like it was gonna happen again. Removing it for that purpose was like telling myself ""I no longer need this, because I'm no longer gonna hurt myself for what others did to me.""

Refuse to harm yourself. Find other outlets for getting rid of those feelings: therapy, journaling, beating a punching bag/kickboxing, exercise, scream therapy, meditation, or whatever works for you. 

*I say ""for that purpose "" bc I have an allergy to some bandaid adhesives and medical tape, so I probably have some gauze and wraps on hand for other accidental wounds."	sticks_04	reply	na	na	na	0.992644190788269	no	strong	strong	na	MentalHealthIsland

"You know... if i got someone sick i would shoot them a text and check on them.  Maybe I'm just a different breed...i don't know. 

Also, if i knew someone was sick and couldn't get to the store, I'd offer to bring them food or meds or something.  Especially after that person has done the same for me (the person who got me sick is a different person than who i think should offer to help me).

I literally live 5 minutes from work from these people.  And yes I'm capable of ordering whatever i need.  It's the point.  I've gone delivery/ expense of eating out on my business trip poor (I'm not destitute- i can get what i need... is just the point that between the trip and now illness DUE to the work trip,   I've spent hundreds i wouldn't usually spend).

"the attempts by case mgmt and myself are failing to house me. i am unmoored, super embarrassed it about it all. got evicted 7/2022 over camera write ups for comings and goings for 11 months. I found several places to live as did case mgmt. Denied after the reference from the eviction is called. I list everything as a matter of routine courtesy it doesnt matter a eviction is on there over my mnetal health crisis call. even if the eviction was wrong its still part of file because im low income housing. 

its month 6 or 7 or 8 I dont want to count it out and Im down about my life Im certain its my last decade. my health is failing and im mid 40s. 

case mgmt tried to call the old landlord, didnt reply. 

I love my frens (my family is now deceased) i love my art and my life even if its a tempoarily messed up. i feel like case mgmt is failng me, probably not true just my worry talking. and i feel the landlord is right is ruin my housing i feel im trash and dont deserve housing. thats how bad the depression gets. how to walkmyself out of that? imsorry im this old and this way. theres no one life in real life to ask im not ok with going up to pple i don t know or that i know and tell them how bad housing is going. im so ashmaed then i get angry at LL for weiting me up as my dad was dying. the triple banger is that i was too upset by the tenant default letter i got 11/1/21 then dad dying that month to leave home. i was honstoiliaed 12/2021 for malnutriotn, not eating, not drinking, then i drank beer, threw my cardiac chemicals off then i had ketosis. total fuck up. total fuck up i hate my outcomes. i was too afraid of 70+ to go to dads funeral. im that much of a weak person. but all i recall was them not at 70 but at 30 something and all in power over us kids i was fraid to face my elders yelling at me.

"You have done the best you could under very adverse circumstances. You have an illness. It puts limitations on your functioning, not you worth. You deserve love. You deserve shelter. You deserve nourishment, both physical and emotional.

It's so easy to buy into our mind's damaging propaganda that we're unworthy. It gives us an answer (the wrong one) to why bad things are happening. Maybe if we can just accomplish the things that make us worthy, things will get better, we think.

You're already worthy. Sometimes life is really hard, and our circumstances are painful, at the same time.

"Hey I just wanted to let you know that I've felt stuck for months, almost a year now. My lease was terminated illegally back in May 2022, was homeless for June. Since then, very little has worked in my favor. I have great friends who gave me places to stay and after months of a downward spiral with money and health, my family has come back into my life. A client loaned me $1000 and my parents have basically offered me support in the case that I slip and have enter into inpatient again . I'm a type 2 bipolar, OCD, Panic Disorder patient.  My mania episodes can last for months and with new insurance for 2023, my meds switched in December and I lost it. 

I don't plan to commit suicide , or do anything bad. I hope to purchase a new LLC to better protect my painting business, and continue to pursue my art career. I've almost got it!! All it takes is a few months of bad luck to take someone down & out.

"Holding pattern over negative rental references from a landlord that evicted me. Pple today post cameras. I think nothing of it but duh security to the property. LL won't let go I'm going outside at night on warm nights over physical pain or I get tempted to drink. I can't drink. I did for a few years over parents and relatives. Pain mgmt is too harsh o can't swallow those pills. Last decade I'm so sorry family suffered so much I'd try anything to ease them but I fucked up. one time I bought mom, dad and I these bracelets about Faith and health her sister laughed at it. I don't have siblings or understand what I did. In some childush way I was trying to unify us three. I've seen chemo, stroke, debilitating illnesses and I keep forcing myself to breathe thru pain and deny I'm in pain but it's a lie. But there are good days when I'm not in pain I'm just laying in bed and  getting car sick to the point of I can't drive and sleep in my car. The trajectory I'm on is my last decade alive and I'm not in need of 741741. Reddit cares big time. I paint, live life at my own pace, I'm just failed. 

The old landlord won't let anyone rent to me. I don't know how to overcome that. I'm HUD housing and I list everything what's wrong with being honest? I've already bought homes, cars, junks, shame doesn't occur to me in housing after old foreclosure 09. Every decade the economy goes flipping I just ride it out. I can't ride out family pain that tethers me to a world that's past tense. I try to live in today, love life today, love others today, love faith or god today, love art today, love(learn about) myself in new ways.

I stress to myself hey you can't give your inner child beer or wine now. Fortify body during tent living. I'm camping where it's warm. 

...I'm probably leaving Oklahoma soon I just can't make it here. I have a good plan in mind for a retreat that I can extend to march. I'm afraid of living in my truck for a long time because what if I'm approached for crime? That crosses my mind but I see such safety in life.

"To give some content, I'm currently on an break from my relationship and not seeing my partner. I said we should take an break because she said she got scared of me. This was due to me raising my voice after someone was pushing and shoving me from behind. 

At the moment, it has been over a week since I seen her last and to be honest, I feel like I can breathe and be me in some weird way. Issue I have is that she has already bought stuff for V Day and honestly, my mind goes blank on it. I just got no real connection for it and that's pretty bad.

"That's a toughie for sure. I have nothing but sympathy and a few observations from past relationships. Consider them, if you will.

&#x200B;

1.) The concept of trauma bonding and how I have sometimes chosen relationships.

I was made wise to this concept from a short term relationship I had and it was quite revelatory to me. I realized I chose other partners who similarly struggled with depression, anxiety, or general neurodivergence. This gave me comfort and understanding, but created a feedback loop where sometimes we would feed into each other's weaknesses but feel comforted by the fact we mutually struggled. I'm not saying you can't or shouldn't date people who struggle with mental health, but for me, I had to realize if what I was attracted to was their struggle, which is not healthy usually.

&#x200B;

2.) Codependency and using resources

My most recent relationship ended out of nowhere when the realization that both of us stopped taking care of ourselves while inside a relationship. That was a tough pill to swallow, but I realized how much of myself I would place on the other person. I forgot I had friends I could utilize, I automatically went to my partner always, I let myself get quite comfortable with having my entire validation be from the other person.

&#x200B;

I guess what I'm getting at is the typical RuPaul ""If you can't love yourself, how in the hell you gonna love somebody else"", but it's true, even if I forget about it the second I get into a new relationship like, every time. Maybe you should look inward and question whether you're using your love of somebody else to distract from the love you may or may not be giving yourself. You need to think yourself worthy of being that partner that is good for her, and based on your rhetoric, I don't know how convinced you are.

No feeling is final, change is possible. Personally, I have found group meditation (I'm not that great at it, but I am honestly trying) somewhat regularly over discord has helped me be more mindful of how many of my problems of depression are just me standing in my way for no real good reason other than ""nah, I don't wanna be better"". Thinking myself unworthy most of the time. Introspection and mindfulness might help you a bit. Take a new breath, start over after the argument, you're still alive.

As someone who has not worked in the mental health field but received a lot of treatment. I can‚Äôt say I relate personally to your experiences but I do relate to feeling spread too thin by the world and people around you. So my only suggestion is maybe get a therapist yourself and I also love your idea of the online service. Because if it successful it could help thousands like yourself and even if it  ‚Äúfails‚Äù at least you learned something and got some new experience out of it. So I hope my post could at all help in just knowing that I care about you as a fellow human and that you‚Äôre thoughts and feelings are important and valid. üíú‚ù§Ô∏èüíú		reply	na	na	na	0.995322048664093	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
So this job i interviewed for told me they would tell me ither way if they accepted me or not. They blew me off and then reposted the job again today. How do i respond on monday to let her know she didn't follow up in the post in a professional way to say im dispointed in her behavior? Im quite livid about not being considered when they obviously found no one better. The location is also undesirable, and they were very snobby during my interview.

"NSFW WARNING!
Well I've never told anyone this but its online so who cares, but probably since like highschool (I'm now 21) I've had fantasies of terrible things happening to me or some characters in whatever game I'm interested in, but I always see myself in the character so it ends up being me. I used to daydream sooo much in highschool I would spend pretty much the entire day doing it just to not really have to be there in the moment, or even just for my enjoyment. I had normal ones like I don't know what if this character and another one fell in love and blah blah, but I would also have ones like what if I was raped at school and how would everyone react and treat me? Or what if my character cut herself but another character finds them doing it or whatever. 
Now the fantasies are a few things, one that I keep thinking about is if I lost one of my legs from the knee down, I don't think about the actual thing that caused it but just my life with a missing leg. It feels nice to think about walking around with shorts and people seeing it, or going to a beach and knowing that people see me with it. Another is getting raped and beaten in different scenarios, like when taking my boyfriends dog on a walk at night or at work, I imagine what would happen then how I would call my boyfriend and be crying and then later just being held by him and crying, typing that one out feels so disgusting jesus.
I kind of think it's me wanting to have a physical thing that shows pain to people? Like instead of feeling terrible inside and no one can see or notice, I would have some physical thing that would show people I have had something terrible happen to me but I am still going. I feel like it would make me feel proud and kind of let people not judge me as much as I think they do. Or maybe it would make me judge myself less because I have a physical reason for not being able to do as much as people or not as good, since I've always felt I do thinks worse than others or just am a bad person in general. This is more how I think I rationalize these daydreams now, but back when I was younger I'm not sure what the reason for thinking about them were.
I plan to tell my therapist about them next session, but honestly I kind of don't completely want to stop thinking about them. I'm not sure I'd say they make me feel good, but they make me feel alright? I think maybe getting more insight into them is good though.
Sorry this is long, and thanks."	SpriteAlright	post	19.935768123817017	female	White	0.4173319637775421	na	na	na	5	MentalHealthIsland
"I used to daydream a lot in past and still do but it's reduced. With lots of characters, scenarios, languages and even new worlds. 

It used to be annoying. But now I still do daydreaming but it's moderate and I use it as coping mechanism whenever I need it. Some people write down their fantasies to release them from their mind.

"I have daydreams/fantasies about bad things happening to me too, although mine are different. I started doing this probably when I was 6 years old. For me it was detailed stories that I pictured vividly, usually about me being kidnapped or constantly trying to escape from someone trying to catch me. I often pictured myself as a different person (characters I made up with their own personalities). Every night I had and still have dreams similar to these stories, but I feel less in control in the dreams-- I can't choose what happens. Reaching adulthood, I began to feel more bothered by this habit because most of these stories are very vivid and descriptive of me going through all kinds of abuse. I have pretty much stopped doing it, but I still have an urge to occasionally and it took a long time to stop. I guess it kind of scared me that imagining so many bad things happening to me made me feel almost comforted or something.

 I still don't understand why I started doing this or why it was so appealing to me to continue doing it. My best guess is that this is a way to put real pain that we've been through into a story that we can control. In my stories, my characters varied greatly in personality from story to story. I could still be whoever I wanted to regardless of the circumstances in the story. And in the stories, I never got too exhausted or depressed to give up on myself, I could be strong when I wanted to. Or maybe it was a way to feel understood and less alone in the abuse I was going through in real life."	SpriteAlright	reply	na	na	na	0.4173319637775421	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

The beliefs that ""I am the worst person"" (or something similar )  is not healthy and it's not true.

The self-destructive beliefs that I have about myself in triggering moments can be rooted in my childhood traumas, while my inner child tries to survive in that moment.

I feel better that I recognized my emotions.

"I'm so proud of you. You deserve better and your feelings are valid. I believe you made the best decision for yourself in this situation. 

If she's telling you to ""man up and stop being like a chick"" she obviously has some maturing to do. She needs to let go of the BS most of us were raised with, that men cannot express themselves emotionally without being ridiculed. I believe it's a very damaging belief that generations have passed on for far too long. 

Bottled up emotions usually lead to exploding in rage down the road. I know this from personal experience as I picked up the message as a small child that I couldn't cry without being seen as weak or being teased for it. Note that I'm female, but I witnessed the harassment my brother received firsthand and I internalized that lesson for myself as well. We both grew up bottling up emotions and exploding into rages because of it. 

Again, I'm so proud of you for standing up for yourself, protecting yourself, and for refusing to take someone back who is being emotionally abusive/demeaning towards you.

We don't have to start back at the beginning when we mess up. We can acknowledge the relapse and the why if we know, and then just continue on from where we left off / from where we fell.

"I ªve struggled with uncertainty my entire life.

I spent time in therapy, group therapy, self help of every kind.

Many years ago, my parents died. I was sent 3 big boxes of stuff from my family. I put it in a garage and forgot about it for many more years. I never could go through it because my entire childhood and young adulthood was about escaping from unhappiness. Recently, I decided to  ªclean out, ª and actually started digging thru my childhood. I came across envelopes full of letters from old boyfriends, friends, penpals, others whose identities I just couldn ªt remember.

I really thought... oh, here is my history. And then I started reading one of the letters and it immediately plunged me back to a time and place where I didn ªt want to be. It took me back to the dysfunction of my family, the whole root of so much unhappiness that has taken decades to reframe.Then I thought.... why keep them? For others to find someday when I ªm dead? To ponder about how fucked up I was as a child and young adult?

I went thru a few more, putting aside old photos. Sure, among the letters were a lot of fun ones, but there was a lot of strife in others. And while I ªve revisited the past through therapy, I just didn ªt want to go thru it all again. I was so lonely back then. So confused, so desperately unhappy without mentors or love. I ªm not famous, there will never be a biography.

So I walked into my office, shredded everything and walked back into my present time."	WesternTumbleweeds	post	33.61575048097037	female	White	0.9846051931381226	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthIsland

"Hello everyone.

I have been struggling a lot recently, I feel like I have been finding some sort of copium on Alcoholism as damn, my life has been crazy sin 2020. Basically I had a GF that I loved, LOVED for real since 2012. We met all the way in 2007, when I was 17 and she was 16. We were really good friends but nothing happened until we turned 21 and 20 respectively.

We spent 7 years together, but out of those 7 years, we spent around 4 in a long distance relationship as her dream was to move to Japan at least temporarily. And me being me I just supported her:You go girl! You got this! you're not alone!

And she made it! She moved to Japan. One year after she moved I managed mine: Moving to Canada. She was so proud of me, and the plan was after Japan she would be moving here to Canada with me. Little did I know, Something horrible would happen.

Long long long long long (3 years story) short, an American friend in Japan, sexually assaulted her. This absolute piece of shit was an absolute waste of skin and I always told her ""Be mindful of this fucker, he sounds like an asshole"". I said that because I saw my partner crying several times because of him. This douche suicide threatened her several times.

And because I told her that this guy was not to be trusted, when this fucker sexually assaulted her, she didn't come clean with me, she told me straight up:I cheated on you

Before this relationship, I had a GF who cheated on me. That problem depressed me so much that I needed antidepressants. My ex GF who lived in Japan said:I am sorry that I am making you feel JUST LIKE you previous GF. I am sorry. I am the worst person on the earth. Get angry at me, please, yell at me, tell my that I am thrash.

Which of course, I did not, I am not a violent person. After a few days of thinking about it we talked and omg, it was a shitshow. She did not cheat on me, she was assaulted by this fucker:He kissed her without her consentHe lifted her shirt forcefully and hurting her on the processHe pulled her pants aggressivelyAll of this while she was saying no, please stop.

And for people saying that ""Omg man, she cheated on you but she is not able to accept it"", she was diagnosed with Asperger's after the fact. So she has a lot of issues controlling emotions and when something over stimulates her nervous system, she goes into a shut off mode.

But the problem is that I have a trauma with my previous relationship. Long story short, after 5 months of this shitshow, she broke up with me and started dating another girl. yes, a Girl. A girl... who was a victim of THE SAME MOTHER FUCKER.

And here I am, destroyed emotionally, drunk at 5:30 am on a Monday, three years later, after a pandemic where I had to spend 2 years without seeing friends. I am destroyed emotionally, I am tired, I an craving hugs, I am craving confidence. I miss being just blobbing it out on the couch while hugging and watching a TV show.

Now, after 7 years of relationship and 3 years of being single, I am lost. I am in a different country. I am single now, no family, a few friends that I absolutely love, but it is not the same as all my friends at my home country, working remote without the chance of meeting more people. I am completely lost. I want to try to make more friends, but I am TERRIFIED now of what if I die alone?

I loved this girl, no kidding. I really did. Now she is lving with another woman, which of course, it means that she doesn't deserve my thoughts, still... it really hurts. I am afraid of dying alone now. I have not been bad at love in the past, usually the girl that I like is the girl I end up with but I am no player, which translates to just 2 GF, one for 2 years in my teens that cheated me and one for 7 years that left me because she came out of the closet.

I am afraid because last time I was on the game, I was 21 and now I am 33. When I was 21 I was thin, Athletic and good looking. Now I am many KG over, still not the worst looking person in the world, but defintely ""attractive"" not being the first thought you have when you see me, I am terrified that because I work remote in a country that is not my culture and now cubby nor my language, will fucking die alone.  


And also maaaaan, making new friends, in a new country, with a different language THAT I KNOW, while working remote? Daaaaaaamn, it is so hard and taxing :'("	porky_bot	post	24.95238174137994	male	White	0.9978848099708557	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

"I was feeling empty for the past few days. Mostly because I am having a relapse of my past. The mistakes I have done. And I told my friend about how I feel. I was over it, but I still get that feeling of regret. Instead of giving comfort, this friend of mine just wagged her finger on me about how wrong I was in the past. Tbh, that friend of mine wanted the best for me. But somehow, I felt like my feelings were not validated. 

Right now, I am learning to suck it up. This is the reason why I am scared to open up. Multiple times I tried, but I just ended up being scolded. It really sucks."	Only_Carpet_4517	post	20.101067516169696	male	White	0.9992967844009399	na	na	na	6	MentalHealthIsland

"Sometimes friends say all the wrong things. They're not therapists and so it's understandable but it still hurts. 

I've experienced this also, so what I do is mentally ""recalibrate"" the nature of the friendship. Some friends are safe to open up to, and some are not. It's a learning lesson, and it's ok to change the friendship. Your friend doesn't even need to know you are doing this. 

The thing to remember is even if they mean well, it's not always helpful to have certain conversations with people. 

Some to friendships have morphed into strictly ""superficial"" convos and that's ok too. As we grow and change, so do these friendships.

"I hear you. I used to struggle with anger management issues and it's always scary to talk about for fear of being judged harshly. I also feel down sometimes and remember what I went through and what I've done. Sadly when I talk about it sometimes, some people get all judgy and start talking about all the ways in which this is bad. Like bruh, I know... That's why I changed, that's why it hurts.

Sorry you went through that, it can definitely be very invalidating but the important thing is that you learned and improved, regardless of who judges what.‚ù§Ô∏è"	Only_Carpet_4517	reply	na	na	na	0.9992967844009399	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
It sounds like you really needed someone to listen instead of providing advice and their opinions. This can be super invalidating and for me it makes me withdraw even more. You being ready to talk about your past is an important step and I hope you can find the right person to help you through the tough times. Personally I have found that when I need to open up to a friend or family I will preface it with something like, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm struggling and really just need a sounding board right now. Would you be willing to let me share what is bothering me?‚Äù When we are direct it sets the tone and tells the other person exactly what we need.

People who make drug abusers and alcoholics, whether current or not, seem like bad people aren't helping them. It's the same tough on drugs mindset that didn't help people decades ago.

Life is complex and complicated so I‚Äôm not gonna go into all the stuff but I‚Äôve struggled with living for a while and there‚Äôs this dilemma. It‚Äôs so much easier to just do the easy thing, sleep, distract myself, watch tv, play video games, not water my plants, not shower, etc. While trying doesn‚Äôt make the place I feel stuck in much more meaningful I believe it might help yet it‚Äôs so hard to find any strength to do that. I‚Äôd rather try to get a quick dopamine fix then exercise or try, I‚Äôm tired of trying and if there is someone or something out there then they know it too. I have this dream of writing a book about my experience in this world but againI feel enslaved in this bed and it‚Äôs so comfortable. Besides, things usually, almost always still suck when I try. It‚Äôs just gotten really bad and it‚Äôs to a point where I feel like a robot, life has nothing to offer.	M31Gavin	post	17.980749688011976	male	White	0.999168872833252	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthIsland

"Hey buddy! Thanks for sharing. You really hit me with your words. Your lack of will to get the things done you know you ‚Äúhave to‚Äù, and the enslavement of your comforts and distractions, are so relatable. 

It sounds like you are going through something, and I don‚Äôt know much about your life, but I‚Äôm sure your feelings are genuine. I hope you know that these are most likely symptoms of distress, and they DO NOT define you. There is a lot more to you!

I‚Äôm curious to know how you feel the days you do manage to get something done?

"I was just thinking, what if instead of feeling bad about ourselves or our actions, we recognized them as at least a probable outcome based on circumstances?

Like, of course you snapped at your kids. You're exhausted and haven't eaten lately.

Of course you use alcohol to numb your feelings. You haven't learned any other coping strategies that work for you.

Of course you feel bad about your body. You're comparing yourself to the top three percent of people in terms of appearance. They're elevated as somehow more worthwhile and deserving.

Of course you're depressed. You're still carrying trauma and self worth issues that have haunted you for years.

We still need to be accountable for our actions. I just think unwarranted shame over what we think things ""should"" be is so insidious and toxic we don't even recognize it most of the time.

Once we start accepting that we're doing our best, that we didn't get to choose our life experiences or physical attributes, we can let go of unrealistic expectations. We can start celebrating who we are."	roanwolf75	post	39.40392252408353	female	White	0.007188198156654835	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

Personally, i don't think that ""I have nothing to offer anybody"" is a true statement. i feel/felt the same, yet here i am engaged to the love of my life.

Many of us have said and felt these things before
YOU'RE NOT ALONE
But believing all these things isn't helping so you need to try drastically different things including your attitude starring worth the language u use. Self defeating talk low self esteem everything must go.
Change may include meds, therapy, hospitalization, group support, changing living situation, nutrition and exercise, hobbies ect...
Everyone is different and needs to find what works best. First I suggest seeing a Dr. Sounds like you need a higher level of care like hospital or psychiatric care. You need cbt therapy weekly if not more like an intensive program to work on changing thought- behavior patterns. You need support. Group therapy or some type of support group (NAMI SMART recovery, meet up 12step ect) to find peers who understand you.
I've said exact things you have.

"There are certain feelings that dominated my thoughts over the years. 

Feeling the guilt and shame and letting it grow bigger and not controlling it and ending up into feeling unworthy and hopeless. 

I used to simply hated my existence alot just because I breathe, for no valid reason. I know that events in my past led me to think like this.

I'm kinda turned into two split entities, one that wants to destroy me and one who wants to fight. A conflict that I watch in a daily life. I'm trying to control these by understanding both sides.

My family started raising chickens for eggs last year. Out of 16, we‚Äôve lost 6 to diseases. Yesterday, I had to cull one who had become so sick that she had ‚Äúwryneck‚Äù (couldn‚Äôt hold the weight of her head up with her neck), and was having occasional spasms. Not knowing what I was doing, I tried to take her out mercifully and with as little suffering as possible, but I failed. After two attempts, she was still very much alive. I watched a YouTube video on how to do it right after that, and thought for sure that the third try worked. I left her in a box on the porch while I gathered my resolve, but when I came out to bury her, she was still warm, still kicking, and I‚Äôd swear, still looking at me. I took her out into the woods and just laid her on the ground. Today when I got home from work, I saw that an animal had helped finish her off, and buried what was left of her. After showing my stepson where she was buried, we went back into the house, but I noticed one of his parakeets was missing from their cage. We eventually found him laying behind a little ladder at the back of the cage, so I took him out and thoroughly cleaned the cage for the remaining bird. I wrapped the dead bird in tissue and set him on a high shelf where our other pets couldn‚Äôt mess with him until my wife got home. After supper, I took him outside to bury him, but he still felt warm to me, and didn‚Äôt seem to have rigor mortus. I had my wife double check to see if he felt warm to her, but he didn‚Äôt. I dug the hole, but I couldn‚Äôt stand the thought of burying the little guy alive, so I just set him in the hole and didn‚Äôt cover it. I figured I‚Äôd see if he felt cold when I leave for work in the morning. Does it sound like I‚Äôm hallucinating or delusional to you all? I really feel like I may be.

"I plan on deleting this post soon, I just want your opinion on my problems.

I feel insecure with every move I make, anything I say, it's like I can never do anything right. My main problem with all of this is that I feel like one of my friends is mad at me. Honestly, I've made a mistake because this friend of mine is really a good person, I just feel like I give them a bunch of bull because I'm an emotional wreck. This friend I keep on mentioning is someone I have feelings for. They know that I like them but said that I'm a good friend and extremely supportive but he doesn't feel the same way. You see, I understood that and I tried to make it clear through actions that I would not be trying to start anything. But I foolishly told a friend of mine my situation and they were all like ""I'm gonna put you on"". They ended up telling my crush that I liked them in front of two of his main bros, and I was just embarrassed. My crush looked at me and I crumbled. I played it off though making it seem like I was fine but after that day he has been kind of distant. I am not sure if I should repair the friendship or I should let it still be awkward and distant. I never told any of my friends that it hurt me because I hate being vulnerable. I don't like feeling weak at all."

I know that not many people will read this, and I doubt many will post on it. However, I need to get this off my chest. My life is complete shit right now, and I‚Äôm in a deep depression without a way out. On top of all that my roommate is stating he doesn‚Äôt know how much longer he can support me. 

I know he shouldn‚Äôt have to, and I am looking for a job, but my attendance track record is shit because of my manic depression. The cherry on the cake though is my Dad has spent the last 3 months in the hospital after having a triple bypass, and his chest had to be put back together. Saturday morning I‚Äôm heading back home for a month to see if I can help my mom get my Dad better. I‚Äôm not in a good position to be doing this, but what else can I do?

"Hey. 

It sounds like you're in a very rough spot. If you can qualify for any state-insurance I would recommend looking into it. The first step, in my opinion, would be to set up a doctor ASAP to treat your manic depression, or if you're already on medication, to tweak it so that it works better for you. 

The second step would be to lock down employment somewhere. It sounds like your roommate is suffering the stress of carrying both of you. I don't mean that as a negative thing, but keep in mind that they are also under a lot of pressure. It seems like your relationship hasn't entirely broken down, so an earnest step in the right direction--paying rent-- could help you to keep a solid footing where you're at. 

The other option is seeing if you can move back with your mother. She'll need help in all kinds of things, including emotional labor. Having you around *might* be beneficial depending on your relationship. 

I wish you the best. I know these situations can be mind-bogglingly difficult, but you can do this."	Candy__Canez	reply	na	na	na	0.9970484375953674	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

If possible please try to separate yourself from your situation, like don't try to identify with it or blame yourself, this helps me sometimes. As for your room mate, can you help them in other ways like taking up chores, cleaning etc. You can learn some DIY and maybe fix stuff in your place. This might help with your confidence and relieve some pressure off of your roommate.

I know jobs sometimes add to stress but they can also take your mind off from daily problems as well, try to get any job you can. It can make a difference."	Candy__Canez	reply	na	na	na	0.9970484375953674	strong	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

"I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I can't imagine what you've been through.  I imagine nothing seems as meaningful as it once did.  Is this how you feel?

Unfortunately, you may never fully heal from your grief.  But I can suggest three things.  

One is to find non-judgmental people to talk to, whether it's a group, a friend or a decent therapist.  Speaking out loud has a cathartic effect.  Again, it may not solve your hurt, but it may make it more manageable in terms of how you feel about life again.  Don't expect quick results.  Months or years of talking about it may be necessary before you start to feel better.

Second, try to find time to meditate.  I find meditation annoying to practice but helpful the day after I meditate.  I meditate for about 20 minutes a day if I'm good.  Unfortunately, I skip too many days.  But when I do meditate, I feel somewhat calmer and able to breathe the next day.  (Beneficial results, in my experience, are not immediate, so don't expect it.  Usually, you feel a bit better the next day.)  How meditate?  People have their preferences.  I keep it simple with mantra meditation where I close my eyes and just keep saying my ""secret"" word (""Harim"") for 20 minutes.

Third, when you feel ready, lower your creative expectations and take baby steps.  When I'm resistant to creating, I like to just open the creative thing and not do anything.  Like a Word document.  I'll just open the file so it's on my computer staring at me.  I'll feel like that's a big accomplishment.  Then I get used to it being open.  Then I keep walking past it.  Then I get bored and sit down in front of it.  I'll start reading what was there before.  Then I'll get up and ignore it.  But it's started to percolate in my head.  Then I get an idea and I rush over to write it down.  Often, half and hour later I've written a page or two and I didn't even notice the time passing.  I got organically sucked into it.  All because I had low expectations at the start and just did really slow tiny baby steps.

I sincerely wish you the best."	ForDigg	reply	na	na	na	0.014646523632109165	strong	no	strong	na	MentalHealthIsland

My ex of 5 months said he doesn‚Äôt want a relationship with me anymore. He said he tried and after all that, not anymore but I don‚Äôt see him struggling or communicating with me when he is hurt or when i did something that upsets him. That‚Äôs a bit unfair from his part as I would communicate with him whenever i feel something. He has been telling these to one of my mutual friend, thats how i know. 

He said the relationship did not fail, it ended. My friend said to start it, and he said no. My friend then ask what‚Äôs holding him back and said both of us still love each other and my ex said nothing is holding him back."

i woke up yesterday to a black chin like someone abused me but i cant remember, my best friend was at my house, i questioned her what happen, no response. she is technically my ex we have a love hate relationship toxic as fuck but shes ignored me 2 days now. her toxic i hate him bf was at my door, I didn‚Äôt recognize him through the blink so i was like who are u etc u didnt say shit i open door and he pulled her out. this was 2 days ago. today he moved in with her. like ok whatever I tell her I love her and I‚Äôm always here for her. That‚Äôs the end of that conversation. it is what it is. 6 years later she chooses hector like whatever the guy before him beat here everyday and was fucking my ex gf that couldnt get off the pipe even took that ex love of my life home to texas to help her get sober. introduced her to my family but once again disappointed she was mething around in my nieces bathroom. i left her that night i was drunk but fuck that came back to kansas. I once again forgave her recently but she did the same thing of why i left her. back to upstairs I mean honestly with all three been through alot. love-hate relationship. so I forget my girlfriends let‚Äôs go to the point of my story i just got out of jail 10 days long as ever $75,000 bond and a $7000 bond and only that I‚Äôm low key dating a girl in jail which I‚Äôm about exhausted from her because I‚Äôm going through a lot and she‚Äôs constantly blowing my phone up. Keep her money on her shit but sometimes I just don‚Äôt wanna talk anyways six years ago I was with a Muslim guy and I loved him because he almost killed me, so before I went to jail, I was drunk as fuck and I called him after five years or when I was in jail I remember why I left him and then I talked to him today and he was like if you keep bringing this up, I‚Äôm gonna block you because he has not adknowledge it, makes me hate him, even more like when I went to jail he stage my house to get robbed just bathroom jewelry which was super odd being that I‚Äôve left her for years and that‚Äôs never happened. If you‚Äôre going to rob me here I take a laptop podcast my phones everything but whatever he staged that so I could depend on him. I remember last night he was like you don‚Äôt love me etc. no i dont he put cameras all over the house made me lose my job there and the guy was fucking wife, between my sister and the Russian guy I got out of jail and I came home locks were changed I had to climb through my window to open my door, and then I called my landlord and him and russian guy were going to fight. I just slow just say fuck it and blocked everybody. I‚Äôm just so exhausted. Hears me venting on only partial of the story. I‚Äôm still trying to figure out why I‚Äôm bruised up in my face. i guess ‚Äúimcrazy‚Äù in the end we all die but im not crazy.

"I looked back and was trying to compare myself with my past. 

Whenever I fall down, I recover a little faster than what I was in past. My overall hatred toward myself is less. Sometimes I even don't hate and judge myself.

There are a few hours of day that I feel satisfied and sometimes I can feel joy. 

Sometimes when I feel hopless I talk to myself like a second person and try to understand my feelings. I'm not good at this but I wasn't like this before and I'm getting better at not expanding my sadness and not letting it control everything inside me.

Although I may fall apart next week, but it's ok because I was in this maze before and I'm capable of finding the better paths. Even if I can't find my way next week, that's fine, I can try it next time."		post	12.75619574539975	female	White	0.0023304205387830734	na	na	na	4	MentalHealthIsland

"I barely drink. I mostly have weed gummies or natural supplements. Last night, I had six beers while playing Red Dead 2. I was trying to discover every dinosaur bone. It was all so beautiful and I felt calm while doing it. Out of no where, I thought it would be fun to have a Corona Extra. I was perfectly calm before I had a beer. Simply enjoying my day off. One beer turned to two. Two turned to 3. 3 turned into 6. 

Over the summer I went to Canada with my family. I haven't seen my brother in a while, I made a thoughtless remark on his weight. Him and his girlfriend were hyper focused on it during the entire trip. I wasn't aware. While we were hiking I was trying to talk it out. I've been overweight at least 5 times in my life. And every time I got healthy again, it was an awesome change. I was trying to have him see it from my perspective. We were driving home and he put his radio on full blast to not hear me anymore. After an hour of silence, I broke it by trying to come to an understanding. But they were demanding of me. They didn't want an explanation. They kicked me out of the car. I had to fight off a wolf in the cold dark. 

So, while it was my day off from work. And while I was playing Red Dead 2. My feelings about this became amplified. I called my mom. I was extremely blunt about my feelings. 

I just wish I didn't drink last night. I would've just been playing Red Dead 2 hunting that legendary animal. Instead I am worrying about my relationship with my brother. I have reached out to him with no response. It was in the back of my mind. But in the end, I don't care about who is at fault. I want to get it off my mind."	chillingohdylan	post	20.5507095143035	male	White	0.018266407772898674	na	na	na	6	MentalHealthIsland

So, my wife and I are having issues.. I am not wanting to be in the relationship anymore. I am terrified to tell her this. She wants to work on our marriage but the marriage is wedging me away from being able to improve myself. College has caused so much anxiety because my wife says I over do it. I don‚Äôt have time for college and a relationship. I also don‚Äôt have time for work and school. Furthermore I have come to self admission to where I fall in line with gender dysphoria. Transgender issues have been a secret in my life since I was a kid and I came to terms with this since April 6th 2022. Wife doesnt know about this yet and I am terrified of it. She hates LGBTQ and would never support it. It‚Äôs mortifying to me that I must come to terms with this or live a lie at 40.

"This last year has been rough for me, and now I don't know how to describe what I'm experiencing so I want to see if anyone can relate. 
I feel so weird, like sometimes when people talk to me or i talk it feels like i'm high and i get that out of body uncanny valley feeling of the conversation just feeling Weird somehow. It's extremely unsettling and life feels surreal and everything feels so flat, purposeless/aimless and strange. Like I'm having this realisation that now i'm finishing my education i have to set my own goals and aims in life and i don't even know what i want beyond to live with my partner. 
I think about mortality a lot, probably obsessively, it is like it's looming over me and because I'll die one day it means my life is already past. I know it's not good to be so stuck in the future, especially a future where I'm no longer alive (it feels like i have fomo for after my death) but last time i saw a therapist she basically told me to just not think about it. 
i'm also quite irritable at the moment, and i don't like it. i feel a bit socially isolated beyond my relationship with my partner and a couple of close friends. maybe i will feel better when i return to study or work starts up again?

"I'm so sorry that you have to go through this with your friend. Trust me, she probably feels bad for shutting you out. I've been in her place (still am) and she'll probably open up when she's ready. You sound like a great friend but if you need to pull away or feel mentally drained by her actions, it is your right. You must try to take care of your own mental health issues first. Have you tried seeing a counselor? I'd start with that if I were you and perhaps your friend needs one as well.

"Thanks for sharing and sorry you're going through that! 

In my experience as someone who suffers from anxiety, expressing my true feelings can be hard at times due negative thoughts running through my head that aren't true 99% of the time (like thinking someone is mad/hates me when they don't at all) and overthinking the small things that feel like a big deal. Your friend could be thinking she's a burden to you or she doesn't want to drag you down so shutting herself in and avoiding people (not showing up to school etc.) could be her mind ""protecting"" herself, possibly? 

Maybe you could reach out again whether that's in person, text, call or video call and (gently) express how you're feeling. If I was your friend words of affirmation, expressing how she's not alone, suggesting reaching out to a therapist/counselor (at school or outside of school) and if you can relate to how she's feeling could help. 

I'm just sort of blurting out thoughts. I don't normally comment on posts and I felt that need to share my pov. Hope this helps OP!"	VolumeCompetitive529	reply	na	na	na	0.9993301630020142	strong	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

Woke up and felt lots of anxiety. The pain didn't go away so I wanted to feel something else. I was thinking about self-harm so maybe I could forget other things. I didn't do it. Right now I'm just aware if it's needed to go to mental hospital in  the next city. If situation gets worse I will go there. I somehow can't trust myself for the time being.

Did my best, asked them questions about what they did (what colleges they applied to, what course/major, reacted when someone told a story, cracked some jokes) then social anxiety hit me like a truck when I got home. I wouldn‚Äôt have done anything like this 5 years ago, so I guess that‚Äôs progress, but I wonder if I came off too strong/overcompensated.

"My friends in the group chat have this thing where we either play video games and watch tv shows which seems good but I don't like that I have to do it everyday because 1. social anxiety whenever I'm chatting, 2. Anxiety and depression, I have moments where I'm just not in the mood for the sesh due to high stress levels and me being so fixated on fixing my problems by spending too much time on google. 3. I have IBS-D so I often feel too sick to join but I don't want to bring up my sickness card too often because I'm worried they'll question me for it and I just have moment where I would much rather be on my own for whatever reason (let's say gaming). I didn't have a problem with it back then because it wasn't a daily thing. It used to be a once or twice a week kinda thing. I was perfectly happy with that and now it's a bit overwhelming. What frustrates me as well is that they expect me to always be available just because I'm unemployed. Yeah I get it but I can't do it everyday for physical and mental related reasons.

UPDATE: I finally got the courage to explain my feelings towards this whole thing (all thanks to everyone of you who replied) and one of them (the admin of the group chat) actually understood well enough to stop asking me to join. I think that's a win. I still want to join sometimes but certainly not everyday lol"	Tu5han	post	23.999198660168414	female	White	0.9928014278411865	na	na	na	7	MentalHealthIsland

"Find a good balance between introspection and activity. You want to take care of your feelings and nurture that inner child while at the same time not losing yourself in your sadness.

"     Hi I‚Äôm Koshca I am a jr high student that lives a rather normal lifestyle now after all the trauma I‚Äôve had since I was 3 but I want to vent about something that like just happened I will get carried away so I will try my best to filter anything that would be of offense on with what I want to say please take notice that I‚Äôm having a episode or breakdown rn so my words might not make sense 

     A little background knowledge I was two cousins living with me rn both are under the age of 5 and they‚Äôre both brats to be honest but I still don‚Äôt understand why the older one did this tonight. I will just refer to him as Gg for now. It like 9 pm and he is supposed to be asleep but he‚Äôs not he‚Äôs lurking around in the hallway and kitchen taking stuff from the kitchen and bringing it to his room. This is the first time he did this but not the first time he‚Äôs been an utterly rude brat. Gg is horrible to live with it makes me question why my uncle would even decided to have kids if he wasn‚Äôt ready. Well my step dad thought someone had broken in and so my mother had called me checking if it was me who was making all the noise in the hall and kitchen but I was sitting in bed not thinking to much of the noise thinking it was my step dad getting up because he forgot to take his medicine or something like need to throw out an old water bottle or something. So he went out of his room with a loaded gun in hand. He had went into the kitchen and didn‚Äôt see Gg under the table, so he when into the living room to check and well Gg thought it was a good idea to leave his hiding spot and run to his room. My mom was by her door which had a full view of the rest of the room doors including my Mexican cousins room. Then my gardens went in their room(cousins)obviously very angry that Gg went around the house making a reck. I won‚Äôt go into detail in what happens next but after a while of yelling from my gardens they brought Gg outside to show him how late it was they normally would leave him outside while somebody would watch him by the door window just in case he did anything dumb. but eventually he was brought back inside (it was only a few seconds) when he was brought back inside he had left the door open and one of the dogs which was my uncles had ran out the front door so me and my mom not wearing proper clothes were driving around the neighborhood looking for the dog we found her and brought her back after a few minutes. We go back to yelling and my step dad talking apart Ggs bed frame which was a race car so that thing was hard to get out because of its weird shape. After a while I went to go comfort the two pups in the house that slept in the dining room area I was yelled at for comforting them I can understand that you don‚Äôt want the puppy‚Äôs to run away but at least don‚Äôt yell. I hadn‚Äôt told my step dad about my ‚Äúmom diagnosed‚Äùcptsd and Lind story short my trigger is yelling and since I‚Äôm in jr high I have quite the problem with having a breakdown in class or I would just get sick after a while. So yay rn all I can think about is my horrible past and how if I did something differently my father could have still been alive. 

     On to the next one. I was thinking about how i grieve recently and honestly I think the way I grieve is by doing something that that person had wished for . For example my dad only wanted me to smile more and so I did it hurts when I smile so to the fact I don‚Äôt do it often but the 2 or 3 year since he died was nice cuz I‚Äôm some way I was able to smile again with no pain at all but eventually I would have gone back to how I was before with my almost emotional-less face and life I just survive these days I don‚Äôt really live my life to it‚Äôs fullest I know I have a lot more potential but I tend to ignore that and go straight to the gloomy stuff. I wouldn‚Äôt mind it though. I do like the fact that I‚Äôm more comfortable in my smile now because of my father‚Äôs last dying wish"	FIN_1937	post	17.26328902772841	male	White	0.9978506565093994	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthIsland

"Even as a kid I would have a hard time sleeping due to an active imagination, but I find that as I get older it keeps getting worse. 
-A few years ago I got a job in retail and would find myself tossing and turning reliving my day on the cashier and thinking how I could have said a word differently or pressed a button quicker to the point I had to quit because the thoughts at night were killing me more than the actual job itself. 
-I tend to ‚Äúplan‚Äù conversations with people ill see the next day even though when I wake up the next day I forget what I even stayed up thinking about. 
-I have endless amount of energy despite drinking caffeine or having lack of sleep to the point I feel exhausted but just can‚Äôt sleep. I‚Äôll try to count, zone out, use an audiobook, but somehow I find myself fixating on soemthing without even realizing it.

I‚Äôve taken magnesium but don‚Äôt think it has any effect on me. I don‚Äôt want to rely on Melatonin, but I‚Äôve taken it before and it works until I use it too much and it gives me awful nightmares or wakes me up at 5am no matter what.

Imagine a candle in a dark room.

The wax slowly melting... dripping down the length of the candle. Everything changes slowly except for that flame. Always moving. Always flickering. 

Any outside thoughts need to refocus on the flickering candle. Expend your mental energy on animating that flame. Bore yourself until the overstimulation fades into boredom and sleepiness. 

My problem has always been that my thoughts are more interesting than sleep. Refocusing my thoughts on a simple, boring candle has helped."	Cold-Country-3022	reply	na	na	na	0.9987506866455078	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

"I had a really bad morning yesterday. I called in for the third day in a row. My SI was really high, and for *once* I followed my safety plan at an appropriate time. In the past,  I've just tried to hunker down and endure the worst of my symptoms. I almost always pull away from seeking help because I don't think I'm worth it.

I showered up and was getting ready for work, but I just couldn't pull out of the steep depression spiral I hit. After a while of painful rumination, I finally called the Mental Health Hotline. 

It really did help to just talk over my feelings without trying to protect anyone from how bad I was. The key was getting help exactly when I needed it. When I went over everything at once with the counselor, I realized I actually *am* in a really rough place. It's been so hard, and my feelings are justified.

I actually cried while I was on the phone, which is quite rare.

Anyway, the 988 hotline is active throughout the U. S. and it's territories with Language Line assistance for any language other than English or Spanish (which are offered without a third party). I certainly recommend utilizing it or another resource as needed, *before* you're in an emergency ideally. You should still call 988 or 911  *in* an emergency. 

From what I've read, dispatch of emergency services and/or hospitalization is only done if it's required; it's not automatic. They utilize the least restrictive implementation possible.

We both had an amazing relationship. His parents knew about us since the very start of our relationship and they were cool with it. I met his mom and she is a very sweet lady. But all of sudden, he broke up with me telling that his parents are asking him to do so. His mom texted me asking to not interfere in his life again. I still don't know the exact reason why he broke up with me out of the blue.

I assumed it was about his career and told him that I can wait till his exams are over (we can take a break and figure it out later). But he wasn't willing to do that. He said that even in the future his parents won't let us be together and the relationship won't have any future if we date in secret. I decided to let him go cause I don't wanna ruin his relationship with his parents. They have worked hard all these years just for him and it won't be right if I ask him to chose me over them.

I'm completely shaken. Please give me some support on how to overcome this situation."		post	12.58600355979332	male	White	0.9980983138084412	na	na	na	4	MentalHealthIsland

He‚Äôs too young to go against his parents‚Ä¶sometimes when young adults find themselves in relationships they tend to lose focus on their priorities maybe he‚Äôs slacking in school and they want him to focus!

My ex of over 4 months, when asked about me by his friends, he said he doesn‚Äôt want to talk about me cuz he does not want to catch feelings for me. They asked why he hate me that much, he said he doesn‚Äôt hate me, he just doesn‚Äôt want to talk about it. 
What does that make me? Am i hard to forget? Is he forcing his feelings to get rid of me? Why is that? Does he still have feelings for me?

If there was something on your end that you could fix...than I would let him know you were willing to.....If you can't think of anything...he is just going to have to work out on his own what his issues are with you...and decide if he is going to contact you again.

He will know if he waits too long you will be gone...He knows this...you want HIM to decide because you don't want to force or pressure anyone to be with you.

I was miserable and questioned whether I wanted her back every day. But I‚Äôm going to do everything I can to not see anything about her or contact her. That‚Äôs the only way we heal.

I see a psychologist one time per week and it's working, really good actually. I'm seeing myself getting better, step by step. Eating a little better, exercising, being grateful, being happy.

But, there is something missing. I couldn't said what it was until some minutes ago. It was like my mind just clicked and I end up saying to myself ""wake up, respect yourself"".

And that was it. The last piece of the puzzle. I'm not putting myself first. I'm constantly living to help other people but when I should being help myself, I avoid it. I always help others with daily things but I end up not doing my own things right. And all of that need to get a stop.

It was supposed to be a restart. Brand new year. New beginning. Whatever you want to call it. But I'm struggling. I called in sick yesterday and today and I feel terrible about it. I just couldn't get my anxiety to calm down. I wasn't panicking. I've learned how to (mostly) keep calm (at least), but the anxiety, the dread, the just not wanting to leave the house because of it, won't go away. The closer it got to having to go to work, the worse I felt. This happens all the time and I really don't know what to do. It shouldn't be this way. It shouldn't be so hard to live life.

Give your self a break. I know in the cooperate world it means your value is based in your work load. But if you take all that garbage away, what are you left with? You gotta prioritise you. So what if someone else feels uncomfortable by what you do, you know you best. I struggle with holding down full time jobs for this very reason. All I can tell you is that its your responsibility to look after you. No one else has a right to tell you how to live your life	CherryCherry5	reply	na	na	na	0.9994786381721497	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
"I'm struggling with my pronouns and I can't tell anyone about it. I'm sure they would support me but I am just ahve trouble with it. The supported me as Bisexual but I feel like if I wanted my pronouns to be they/them, I would be pushing my luck even though I have been told they didn't care, is it normal to feel this way? I am very open about being Bisexual.  I don't even know anymore. 

Just... is it normal to be scared about wanting my pronouns to be they them but scared to come out when i don't even know?"	MikeWheeler10	post	19.354232017283334	female	White	0.9988383650779724	na	na	na	5	MentalHealthIsland

"Even with supportive friends and family, it's common to have lingering fears regarding gender identity and sexual orientation. It looks like you may identify as non-binary. 

The underlying fear of rejection is hardwired into us as social creatures. The brain's reaction to the threat of rejection is comparable to its response to physical danger.

There's no rush. Put yourself in a comforting environment when you're ready, and remember these are people who love you. They may have trouble adjusting at first and might make mistakes. With practice, they'll get it right. 

You're worth it, especially to the people who love you most."	MikeWheeler10	reply	na	na	na	0.9988383650779724	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
"It‚Äôs completely normal and it‚Äôs OKAY! Consider giving yourself some time to understand which pronouns you prefer and giving yourself more time to discover who you are. Once you feel comfortable in your own skin is when you can tackle other people. Give yourself some time and know that what you‚Äôre going through is completely okay. We all need time to figure out who we are, I know I did. 

When I was able to feel comfortable about my sexuality, I reminded myself of one thing, if those around me, whomever they were couldn‚Äôt accept me for whom I was/am, I couldn‚Äôt let them stand in the way of my happiness and my freedom to be myself. 

I promise you will figure it out! Xx"	MikeWheeler10	reply	na	na	na	0.9988383650779724	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland

"Just do yourself a favour and before thinking about that, feel how you identify with your body. Specifically, i don't just mean to think about it for 30 seconds. Eg do 20 push ups and measure how your muscles feel, and how that feeling is you right now, and what that means. Mental health is inextricable from physical health as the mind is from the body. If you're alienated from it, you'll have weird thoughts. I'm speaking from experience, which i regret. I'm just trying to warn you that not all thoughts, feelings and identifiers are true, good, or permanent. There is delusion, lies, and temporarity. So don't worry about it too much, first of all. It's not something you solve in 3 days. What you are will make itself clear as you polish your actions and character in the world and among others; not necessarily from what deductions and intuitions you follow right now, probably by yourself and only counting on yourself. And when you understand that your reputation is ultimately decided others, you'll also know that you're completely in charge of what they base their judgement on. You're already and always are yourself, that is your identity. Pronouns are the reputation you try to produce yourself, for yourself. (And please don't misinterpret this as ""i don't believe you"" or ""your identity isn't valid""; imo either it's right and you'll know and feel it's right, or it's not; but it will be evident on its own merit, and that doesn't depend on your efforts. Many parts of your identity are not chosen but given, inherited.) Sorry if I'm incoherent, it's half a vent and half a tip, so don't take all i said personally. 
Don't isolate, don't obsess, don't stress.

"So my grandmother died last week and I had to travel home go see family for the funeral. It's been a disaster for me mentally from the jump. I have a lot of trauma about coming home and being around family. I generally consider myself a worthless social reject as evidenced by by treatment I received in high school and the continued lack of attractiveness that would be indicative of being brag worthy enough for my family to be interested in me. My suit for the funeral is not fitting great and I feel like my face and nose and height and body make me absolutly worthless to the human race. I'm having some stronger suicidal ideations. My brother has a lot of charisma and people validate his worth by showing attention.  I have no such validation and absent of that I can't tell I have any worth.

Now I find out that the only thing I was looking forward to - my flight home so that I can seclude myself to cope- may be delayed due to weather and  I will be stuck here."		post	27.794963898770973	female	White	0.9994733929634094	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

"I'm so sorry to hear about how much pain you've endured and continue to suffer. Your value as a human being is not contingent on your accomplishments or physical appearance. Even those we envy often struggle with self worth.

I can only imagine how *very* difficult it is to see someone else in your family get the attention and validation you crave, and have been denied. 

I can understand why you would feel the way you do. I'm not happy with my appearance and the last three years seem to have aged me ten. I've never gotten past ""some college"" in terms of education. It's really hard to feel worthwhile in a world like this. 

There are people who will love you just as you are. I'm so sorry your family hasn't been among them. 

So come sit with us. We may be broken, but we have some warmth to share with you."		reply	na	na	na	0.9994733929634094	strong	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
"I‚Äôm sorry to hear what has happened and I am sorry for your loss. I just want to say that you shouldn‚Äôt worry about validation from others. We live in a world where we care so much about what others think that we lose our self worth to try and impress others. 

I know you have gone through a lot and it has caused so much self doubt, but you are worthy. You are worthy of love, kindness and happiness. People who seek validation will not be happy because they will always want more. Be happy within yourself, not how others view you. Be comfortable in yourself, you have gone through a lot so be kind to yourself. You are a human being. You have worth. Please keep your head up and be the best person you can be, not what others want. I don‚Äôt know if you are religious, but I just want to say that God loves you. You don‚Äôt have anything to prove to other people. 

I hope this helped"		reply	na	na	na	0.9994733929634094	strong	no	no	na	MentalHealthIsland
"I'm at a point where I don't want to hide my mental health problems (stress / anxiety /depression) with my family and friends anymore. For the major part I feel like I'm pretending to be okay in front of them, and that caused more harm than good. Have you guys got any tips on how to start sharing my circumstances with my close people?

Maybe you guys need more context to help, but I don't know what to tell, so feel free to ask and I will try my best to answer."	CheapBanana1050	post	43.373349471262216	female	White	0.9933298230171204	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthIsland

"yes, ADLs! yesterday was off kilter today was a swim and walk in the warm air. my phy pain put me in bed last week. i needed to be present and active, phy health then mental health put me on my back for a while. i was afraid to move from the pain i laid so still...today i madde sure I walked, swam, stretched...not eating today until later but thats a longer story. ADLs were slipping in november last month was better this month is still good. i track my details on my calendar. sometimes its called pool, gym, protein, pool, gym, protein. nourish, replenish. 

the pool was perfect today then the walk was special i saw a couple with dogs playing. i focused on the pets at the walk because my head hurts. ididnt feel like facing people or talking to anyone today. i told case mgmt i have no options but their office and their policies are unfair i said ok unfair policies i'll just suffer shit out. i feel i depressed my therapist so i wont go back.  i feel given up on. thats NOT TRUE its just a mood.
