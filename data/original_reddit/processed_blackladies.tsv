"A running joke I see on the internet is how white people will only compliments your braids when they're falling off the bone. The joke is framed to be a laugh at how ignorant white/non-black people are about black hairstyles but I've always had a sneaking suspicion it wasn't the truth.

Okay little diversion, for anyone thats lost a large amount of weight I'm sure youve experience """"friends"""""" that used to hype you up and compliment you all the time while you were big suddenly turn cold af now that you dropped a couple dress sizes, if you have white/non-black/lightskin etc friends you'll be 100x more likely to experience this because you know how they love a fat black sidekick and hate seeing black women be desired. 

This is the exact same experience applied to hair. Anyone with eyes can tell when braids stop looking nice, if they saw them when they were fresh and said nothing but when the roots are poofy white stuff is showing they're suddenly singing praises it's disingenuous.

""Babe it's not that serious, not everyone moving like a supervillain"" you might be saying right now and I need you all to trust me when I say non-black women are very very calculated in everything they say to us, they are the reigning champions of passive aggression, backhanded compliments and hidden meanings. I have a running joke with myself that when a non-black women is overly friendly with me I book a gym class cause I'm not about to become anyones sidekick.

This post is inspired by another post I saw on here about someone's white-latina co-workers making remarks about the posters hair. The question appears 'innocent' but they ask it to get you to admit to having *gasp* fake hair in order to humble you. Trust me guys non-black people, ESPECIALLY women know what they're doing.

"I totally know and understand where you’re coming from and I’ve learned this at an early age. When I was in 8th grade a classmate of mine who was Latina named “Jen” would constantly compliment another classmate of mine named “Greyson” who was dark skinned and overweight and honestly wasn’t that gorgeous in my eyes. 

Like Jen would go over the top with her compliments where I just knew the compliments were not sincere. So one day I asked her “do you think Greyson is that pretty?” 

And you know what she says? “No, I just feel bad.” 

I kept on asking her why she felt bad and she kept on saying that she felt bad with no explanation. So from an early age I learned that not all compliments from non Black women are sincere especially when they are over the top and grandiose for something or someone who is regular or below average. 

Sometimes they view it as a charitable act to compliment someone that they view as ugly and maybe it assuages their guilt for the racist thoughts they’re really having.

My co-workers usually compliment my braids when I have them because I usually have my short hair hot combed. Plus usually take my braids out after like month or 2 because it either grown out enough and/or hurting my scalp too much - so if your braids are failing out too much that even white people are cracking jokes about your braids falling all over the place, no offense, it about time to take your braids out anyway....	moo_moochi	reply	na	na	na	0.9963511228561401	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

"Lol I don’t see it as totally malicious. I think they just don’t have the same level of care or attention when it comes to our hair. They see it being intricate and compliment on that. Whereas we look at our hair and can see what’s out of place because it’s been ingrained in us.

"i just don’t think this is true? i’ve definitely worn my fair share of braids past their expiration date and have received genuine compliments from random white people. and i’ve seen white people with messy hair that i genuinely thought looked nice and so i’m sure the reverse could be true. like there’s a stereotype that the black woman with bad wig is married to a rich white man for a reason. 

when you don’t understand the intricacies of a culture it’s harder to know when something is off or “wrong”. it’s why you have white people walking around saying “gyatt” and thinking it’s an acronym.  it’s also why when an indian friend of mine didn’t like her henna i genuinely couldn’t tell what the problem was. 🤷🏾‍♀️

and tbh i don’t think most people are thinking about others hard enough to usually be malicious. and this is coming from someone that has spent extensive time around rich white ppl with million dollar houses. don’t get me wrong, a lot of these women are micro-aggressive in a variety of ways, but i don’t think this is an actual problem."	moo_moochi	reply	na	na	na	0.9963511228561401	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

Doesn’t just apply to braids. I’m natural with a a decently sized fro. I get compliments on my hair daily. But whenever my hair is in a fresh wash n go I only get compliments from other black people. The longer I go without refreshing my style the more compliments i get from white people. Now there is a sweeet spot where I’ll be getting compliments from both because my hair will be more voluminous so it’ll draw more attention. I also remember there was this girl at my old job who got this horrible weave. It was the most ridiculous thing I’ve seen in my life and white people were gassing it up like it was a work of art.

Also what’s not being addressed is that white people are used to seeing bad hair days. They spend most of their time doing the bare minimum for their hair so they’re used to seeing bad hair days as an acceptable standard.

I think it’s fairly akin to southern “bless your heart” culture. Even then, all those words we consider slurs now where the polite terms for a while.

That’s what I was going to say. The way their racism is coded reminds me of southern whites. I’m a bw from the south and I’m good at reading energy/very observant so I can tell.

"I live 10 minutes from my parents and am very close to them. My dad is disabled and I help out when I can (order meds, help my mom give him rides to appts, etc). I am also a lawyer, drive a Tesla and make $200k - these things don’t matter but my point is that I am traditionally succesfull by societal standards. However, I am single and not  married. But I am very spiritual the happiest and healthiest I have ever been…I also look better than ever. 

My older brother lives far but visits my parents once a year. Every single time, he starts drama with my parents. He is not married. He made a lot of money during the crypto boom and owns a nice condo, car, and now has a gf (that we suspect is a golddigger bc she refuses to introduce him her fam/friends).

Years ago, I cut him off bc be tried to sabotage my career but allowed him back in when he seemed sorry. He constantly insults me and my parents. He says my parents lack ambiton and are losers bc they are not as wealthy as him. He calls me a loser and says I should be married/have kids and that it is sad I rent an apartment (I can afford a home but rent bc I like living downtown and don’t want the responsibility). He said renting is for losers. I also prefer living in a secure building as a single woman due to a past stalker. I am in phenomenal shape and work out often, and he said he is “not impressed with someone who has such little responsibilities that they can spend 2 hours a day in the gym” lol. People literally stop to compliment my physique or tell me I look like a fitness influencer. He also says I am a loser for not having a man (I don’t share my dating experiences with him).  He insults my career bc I am employed and not an “entrepreur” like him. (I don’t share my multiple projects or income with him either). Mind you, his “gf” does not even work. He said that while it’s nice I help care for our parents, that I benefited from them bc I lived with them rent free in my 20s (but so did he). I am always listening to him talk about his life and he has no interest in mine, which is fine by me bc I have no desire to share details since he is unstable. But then he says I have nothing going on in my life and likens me to a child. 

It’s exhausting and never ending. I told him he sounds unhappy and I don’t understand the fixation on my life. He focuses on what he sees as my “shortcomings” if I dare say anything he does not agree with. But truth be told, I am SO happy (finally!). It took so long for me to get here and feel confident. And I am happy bc I found peace and meaning with my life, not bc of my financial, material or superficial accomplishments.


I feel sorry for him. And while I accepted long ago that he will likely never a supportive brother, I sometimes do get sad that my only sibling is a dud. I can’t rely on him to help with my dad’s health. In fact, he prob worsens my parents health bc he stresses them out. I feel sorry that they put up with it but my mom worries that if she shuts him out, he will harm himself. 

I asked him to seek therapy. Years ago, he agreed to get into meditation but he went the other way. He quotes Jordan Peterson and said I will always be a bitter single woman. Yet, he seems the most angry and bitter. 

Sorry for the vent. Any tips on dealing with toxic fam is much appreciated. Its sucks I can’t have the adult sibling relationship I see my peers have. But I am learning to accept it as it is. Thanks!"	throwaway4891kid	post	27.113150048651416	female	White	0.9947754144668579	na	na	na	9	blackladies

I had to cut off my brother for a number of years bc he denigrated me for not making more of my life. He thought depression--which I've struggled with for most of my life--wasn't real. When I was hospitalized on suicide watch, he said I just wanted attention. I am pleased to say that, over time, he realized that he'd been a jerk. We've been working on our relationship for a few years, and he's apologized. We're better than we used to be, but developing trusting him is still work for me. The difference was he got into therapy after experiencing his own depression. And we lost our Dad, which bittersweetly helped push past the bs. It sounds like your brother has some major mental health issues that need healing. I'll bet much of his condemnations of you are projections.  It's possible he sees your self-content as something he wants. So he lashes out at you. You may need to set concrete boundaries and avoid him as much as feasible.

the way this paragraph resonated with me!!! while the details of our lives/relationships are different, this paragraph is EXACTLY how I feel about my brother.

I don’t think you have to cut him off completely but engage in whichever way that feels right to you. Set boundaries and whenever they are crossed just disengage or ignore him. 

He is after all your brother and I do believe blood is thicker then water. He sounds very troubled, I wouldn’t take it personally. He can be an asshole and you can keep your distance.

"Yesterday was my birthday! I just turned 23, and it’s got me wondering when Im going to be able to move out of my house.😅 For some context, Im in my senior year of college (close by, about a 20 min drive but I do everything online). I don’t drive yet as I still don’t have my license. I currently only work one job at CVS and the pay is okay, but it’s not as good as it could be in my state. Plus, store hours are extremely iffy and this has caused me to think about getting another job because they’re starting to become very unreliable.
School is about to start up again, I would like to also job hunt as well and overall just create a good schedule for myself. The question is… how lol. Currently I live at home and I am grateful to not be paying rent, but the situation I am in… I won’t get too much into it as this will become a rant but I am basically taking care of myself. Buying myself (and sometimes my little brothers) meals/food to eat, buying necessities like toilet paper, soap, detergent, etc. This doesn’t sound too bad, but having to find ways to feed myself everyday on top of getting ubers to work and other places and replacing necessities for a 5 1/2 person household (my mom’s pregnant… yippee) takes a toll on my finances. I will admit I am sort of bad with i money and saving overall, but even the times where I don’t spend on ANYTHING but necessities… it drains me. Obviously I have enough to take care of myself day by day, but I just keep getting this dreaded feeling of being stuck here for another full year — it feels like it’ll take me forever to move out. It doesn’t help that my mental isn’t in a very stable place either… but it’s contradictory, because I feel like it’s the environment I am in.

So, how did you guys move out? What was your plan, where did you guys start? What was the turning point that made you really HUSTLE? I’m looking for inspiration and possibly some tips to help me at least formulate some type of plan… I’m ready to be serious, I want to be out of here by the time that baby is born or at least before they are 6 months.

"I get engaged in college. So I moved in with my fiancé after college. I went to grad school and he started working. We got married after I finished grad school.

My take is that the rent is too high to move out on your own though. Or at least it is where I live. I’d focus on school with the hope of getting a better paying job before moving out. Like honestly it sounds like it would be better to be out but how will your parents react to you moving out the  moving back if it’s too expensive to be on your own?

"Not in a conventional way at all. 

I moved in with my ex, got cheated on and the last thing I wanted to do was go back home, even though I was only making like $14/hr. 

I took a loan from my retirement plan for the deposit for an apartment, my aunt gave me furniture because she was down sizing, I bought a bed from Amazon and was probably the brokest I’d ever been. 

I was also bad with money, 0 savings, couldnt even get a credit card if I wanted one. 

I’ve had to pawn a few things here and there to keep lights on and have my bills paid, friends loaned me money for groceries sometimes. 

Things got better when I finally paid my car off, now I’m getting paid way more now that I’m in my career and moving to a much nicer place next month and my credit is spectacular.

I’d recommend searching for a roommate, maybe a friend is also ready to take the plunge? If not the struggle may be worth it, it was for my mental health because I was not okay living at home."	molovesyou	reply	na	na	na	0.9958752989768982	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
"You can't compare your situation to what you're seeing with others because it's not an apples to apples comparison.

1. People leave their parent's house because their college is far away. They can pay for this without having full time work because they are using student loans to pay for room and board/apartments/dorms while in college.
2. People who have just graduated can move out because they have full time jobs that can pay rent. Young people also have roommates to split the costs with if they can't afford a 1BR.

You're NOT falling behind for not being financially independent while you're studying for your bachelors. Other people your age do not have that. You don't need to hustle to make money. You need to hustle to finish that degree and find full time work for after graduation, and note that a LOT of people can't afford to move out until WELL into their 20s in this economy.

To answer your actual question, you can start planning for these things:

1. Full time work for after graduation. Your first job will not be perfect. Especially if you need to move out ASAP you should be open to entry level roles in any role that will pay you. You mention entrepreneurship major? Be an executive assistant at a startup, for example, and learn and grow from there.
2. At least one roommate to make rent costs more affordable.
3. Your drivers license so you can figure out reliable transportation when you have full time work

"TLDR below

Get your license now even if you don’t have a car!

Set up your savings and investment strategy. It doesn’t matter whether you have barely  $5/mo start now. Go to r/referrals to get bonuses.

Set yourself up career wise now. Below is one way;

Take your remaining semester break to collect some certifications in either tech or finance.  For example if you do an insurance & SEC license that will push your résumé for any financial sevices company even if you’re in marketing or tech.

Right now ask for an informational interview at evey company where you know anyone.  Ask them to refer you in and  ask whether they get a finders fee for your hire.  Frame it as though you’ll get them $1,000 to get you a job.  It doesn’t have to be their team or department.  The person could be custodian or CEO it doesn’t matter.

Comb LinkedIn and Facebook to see where every working adult you know works. That is where you apply for both internships and fulltime employment .

On campus jobs in a research institute or whatever facility looks good on a resume should be your secondary employment l. Your favorite professors and academic advisor need to help. Ask them where they think you should apply and where they recommend you apply.

TLDR —

Set yourself up for success while you’re with your parents.  Get a few months worth of rent saved.  Get to know people on campus who might make good roomates.  Canvas for kind relarives you can rent from for very little money nd even less drama.

"I moved out at the age of 25. Went away for college, came back home at the age of 22. It was rough in that I felt like I couldn't be my full self living at home, but I wanted to stack up my coins and make sure that once I moved out, I'd never have to move back. I waited until I secured a stable job (it paid just below $40k) and had $5k in savings. The first apartment I found had hella undisclosed pest problems and I had to break that lease, but I soon found a tiny studio that I could afford and I loved it.

"I met my first roommate and good friend at our first ""adult"" jobs out of college. I was fortunate enough to meet someone around my age at more or less the same stage in life. We both wanted to leave our homes, and even though we were only making $12-$13 an hour it seemed like a lot to us at the time so we decided to look for places together. We toured some really crappy places, but luckily she was close with someone who was leaving their place so we jumped on the opportunity to take over the lease.  She had another friend who wanted to also move out, so the 3 of us found a way to make it work.  


It just felt like it was time for both of us to move out. We were both living with our parents, and even though they more or less respected that we were adults, we still got the occasional ""I'm the parent, you're the child"" moments. The real turning point for me was when I was on a work call. My dad was in a bad mood because he wanted the dishes done RIGHT THEN, so he decided to start screaming at me when I was in the middle of work. That was my ""welp...Imma head out"" moment. In truth I actually really get along with my dad and am still close with him, but your late teens/early 20s are just a weird time with parents in general. 

""Just find someone on the same vibe and move in!"" isn't really sound advice.  Here's what I'd advise you to do:  


  
\-Unless you have endless amounts of money, you probably won't be able to afford to live on your own. I was lucky enough to move in with friends the first time around, but for the 2nd time I ended up moving in with someone I met on a roommate finding Facebook group. Start joining groups and trying to vet people now. You don't need to be BFFs, just someone who can respect your right to also live there in peace and can pay rent.   


\-Save up for your first, last, and security and make sure your credit is in okay enough shape. Every landlord is different and may care more about your paystubs then your credit, so make sure you're prepped on both ends.   


\-Work on getting your license. It can open up new employement opportunities and places to live.   


\-It's good to think about your career, but honestly your first few jobs out of college are probably going to be more about getting steady pay than working towards your dream job. And that's okay!  I worked the morning shift at a gym and did office work for my 9-5, then did some freelance work on the side."	molovesyou	reply	na	na	na	0.9958752989768982	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
"I moved out of my moms house the moment I turned 18. Literally graduated from high school, the next day I was moving into my own apartment. 

I had been employed since I was legally able too, at the time, started the emancipation process at 17, and was working as a waitress, and the money was fantastic for a 17/18 year old. I got a simple studio, $550. I know that times have changed and this is no longer the option for many people. 

So my advice, In this economy, stay home and save as much as you can!

You mentioned that you aren’t too great with saving, use this opportunity to get disciplined with that. Build up your credit report! Something that has helped me save is to divide my money by percentage. And have 2 bank accounts. 20% towards saving (comes directly out of my check into a high interest saving account), 50% towards necessities, 20% for debt, and 10% for leisure.  

Once you finish school, buckle down hard and get a second job, third job even lol. I know that’s a lot, but trust it pays off in the long run! Once your savings and credit is in good standing, start looking into ownership such as a condo. That way it would be far more affordable then renting and if you ever decide that you want to move or buy a house, you can have that as a form of income. 

I’ll also say, I did move back in with my mom when I was 24, I became a mom. Stayed with her for 4 years then I bought a home. It’s tough but with discipline and a plan, you can get it."	molovesyou	reply	na	na	na	0.9958752989768982	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
"The “basically taking care of myself” part will only get worse if you move out. ALL of the household expenses then fall on you - sure, you may not be covering those extras for 4.5 additional bodies, but even on your own, paying for all the things solo gets or can get very expensive. Depending on where you live of course and what kind of living arrangement you might be able to move into. Even having roommates can be $$$ 

As far as school, work, schedule, all of that - the time to job hunt was this summer, and get settled into that role so you could have some leverage as far as making the work schedule work with the school schedule. Do you have your school schedule already? If not, you need to get on that asap so the job hunt only entails roles that will work around school and your transportation situation. 

That being said, can you get a license? Is there a car you could access? Or at the very least what does public transportation look like in your area? If it’s available and reasonable to use to get around, stop wasting your money on Ubers and Lyfts. That is sucking up what could be monies you save to move out with, or that could hold you over if you have to leave CVS and don’t find something else right away. 

To answer your question, I moved out with a lot of help, basically.
1. To go to a pre college summer program at 17. Everything was paid for, mom paid for flights for me to get there and back. 

1b. To move for actual start of school year for freshman year of college. Parents drove me and my crap from CA to LA. Full tuition Scholarship but they paid my room and board. I had an off campus part time job and student taught on campus after my first year as a form of work study. 

1c. Moved off campus after my second year because they didn’t have enough dorm space to accommodate upperclassmen. Mom paid rent which included utilities (hella cheap at the time 😭, <$400/mo). I didn’t have a car till I graduated, gifted from them. 

2. Moved back in with them at 36yo when I relocated from FL back to TX. Moved out a year later for a job offer - again, I moved with help as far as physically moving my stuff from one part of TX to another. They also gave me a queen mattress and a couch to restart with since I’d sold all my stuff in FL. 

All that to say if you don’t have some kind of savings, family financial assistance or at least emotional support, and a GOOD job offer that can more than pay all your bills, stay right where the heck you are until you do."	molovesyou	reply	na	na	na	0.9958752989768982	no	no	no	na	blackladies

"I moved out once I got my first big girl job after college. I went to college in another state and then went to the peace corps so it all took a year after my return.

If I could do it all over again, and my parents weren’t so toxic, I would have stayed home for another 2-4 years before their divorce. Had I stayed home I could’ve saved and bought a house in 2019 like my mom told me. Rent is too high for the salaries their offering. 

If you can live with like 3 other people and only pay $600-$800/month then do that, but if you’re trying to live alone then just forget it. My 2 bdrm/2 bthrm 1 hour outside of DC was $1648 when I signed for it Jan 2020. By the time we moved out in February 2022 that same apartment was $2250. AN HOUR AWAY FROM THE CITY. 

Every day I regret not buying a home in the “hood” where I worked for 4 years 😩.

Also while living alone($995)/with a roommate($800) I had to work so much harder. I was making $55k as a teacher ($1200/bi weekly take home), $15/hr as a pastime concierge and I did Rover during the summer and holiday breaks. All extra money went to my savings and bills.

If they have enough yard space you could fix your credit, save up, and get either a shed/cabin or RV put on the property. With a lot of people moving back home with their parents, I believe we’ll see a boom in Gen Z and possibly millennials buying RVs or trailers since newer ones are just as nice as houses and can be less than 600 a month.

In all honesty, it scares me sometimes because I know that I might not have a place to come back to if that does happen — especially since she’s currently pregnant. If they did let me back in, I know it would be at the major expense of my mental health and I’d be charged rent on top of essentials as well. As far as the dorm situation, I always lived within a driveable distance from my college, so I never had to get a dorm. I thought of this as a blessing at first since I wasn’t too fond of the dorms/campus itself… now though, I feel like it would be somewhat of a hassle/waste to try to get a dorm now when I only have 1-2 semesters left and I AM still a driveable distance	molovesyou	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9958752989768982	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

"Thanks for the response… as for the school schedule, i’m mostly online. I’m trying to get something sorted out currently where I am able to be completely online again during this semester. I can take accountability and say I don’t really have what many would accept as an excuse as for not already having my license — i already took the written class, and have taken my drive times associated with that about 2 years ago. Since then I’ve had additional drive times here and then that i’ve had to pay for (50/hr when I had last paid, it’s probably more now), but I still don’t really know how to drive. I could get from point A to point B, but I’ve never learned how to park or really anything else (would you believe the driving school didn’t want to teach me parking because it wasn’t on the test..?) I also have such bad anxiety in vehicles most of the time. My mom always refuses to take me driving and tells me to ask my stepdad as they both have cars, and I have been in the car with him a few times, but it is really stressful driving with him. 

About two months ago he has picked me up from a friends house while I was hungover and on the way home, he unexpectedly pulled over and told me to get us home… needless to say I ended up hitting a few parked cars. It doesn’t help that he also likes to pick and choose the times he wants to teach me to drive; they’ve declined many times so eventually I’d stopped asking for lessons and waited until I had enough money to get a bunch of lessons at once. 

Sorry for the tangent 😭 it just frustrates me and sometimes I get discouraged with myself for not being able to drive at my age. I agree that uber is eating a lot of my money. The public transportation around here (Baltimore) isn’t too bad and I don’t mind taking the bus at all, but from my job would be 3 connecting busses and the busses just aren’t reliable/on time enough for me to risk that. My job used to be a lot closer, about a 30 min walk which I never minded, but we had to move a few months back so my transportation plans got all messed up"	molovesyou	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9958752989768982	weak	strong	no	na	blackladies
"That’s true of most degrees, really - it’s only a small portion that map directly to specific jobs, and even then those jobs are only a subset of fields that degree can lead to. So you’re not alone: most people are going to need to get creative 🙂

As far as moving out is concerned, I would do your best to save right now. These apartment complexes are out of pocket right now with some of the application fees and security deposits they expect. Then on top of that you’ll come across stuff you need to get to build up your household after you move. Having a roommate can help reduce those costs but not eliminate them.

If you’re planning to have a roommate, now might be a good time to start scoping one out - at the very least figuring out any dealbreakers.

I’d also recommend making sure your credit is good - doing whatever you can to get your score higher."	molovesyou	reply	na	na	na	0.9958752989768982	weak	no	no	na	blackladies
"true about the ""creating your own job"" thing.

And if you just want more money than maybe find customer service rep (they make... Something). Staying at home is a blessing and not paying rent is even better tho !! Unless your parents are draining your money another way...

If it’s available to you, you could consider the dorm as a way to “try out” moving out and living “on your own.”  And while there you could look for jobs around your campus’ area so you’re not having to go back and forth to your mom’s house, then try to transition that into a permanent job in that same area once you graduate.

"No problem!

I loved my little studio. It was prefect for a single teenager/young adult lol. Great starter for learning how to manage money and bills. 
Like the Ari Lennox song Apartment, you won’t be afraid of the dark once you get the bill 😂😂

Depends on where you live and where your finances are. So figure out how much are you willing to spend on rent. Rent is just too damn high at this moment! But you can always look, price check, look at amenities, and see what is worth it for you. 

I’m big on ownership, for equity and stability. Had I taken the risk on buying a condo/house when I was younger, knowing what I know now, I would be loaded and headed towards early retirement lol. 

The decision is yours. Just look into all of your options because you have them. Again, figure out if renting vs ownership is worth it for it. List all the pros and cons. Also, don’t be afraid to call around to apartments/condominiums and ask about prices like average cost of lights, water, rental insurance, HOA fees, etc."	molovesyou	reply	na	na	na	0.9958752989768982	weak	strong	no	na	blackladies
"Smh. Why would he ask you to drive if you were drinking? A new inexperienced driver at that. Stupid af - if you get the chance to have either of them assist you with their vehicles again, have them take you to an empty parking lot somewhere, the larger the better. Then you can practice the mechanics of basic driving, parking with the lines, parallel parking, etc. I don’t know what the test looks like now but I took mine in CA ages ago and you def had to park, parallel park, and enter/exit off the freeway lol. So make sure you get all the practice you can, I completely get the anxiety part as I used to be super nervous as well and rode way too close to the right a lot of times, but practice makes perfect. Hoping you can find a way to get the practice without paying for it as well because 🥴 that’s wack 

I definitely feel you on the dependability of bus schedules but - imma be honest with you here - 3 transfers isn’t that bad, frankly. Yes it probably takes you forever to do all that but sometimes you gotta bite the bullet to save a coin. Would not recommend if you work nighttime hours of course but if you have a day schedule - maybe try one day a week of bussing to see how it turns out. Reward yourself that first time with a coffee or something with the money you saved from not ubering, just because. Then increase to two days a week and put that saved money away for the future. Continue. 

My bad, I forgot you said you were online - does that mean you don’t have specific times you need to be online for lectures and such? The world is basically your oyster then as far as jobs, if there is anything else in your area that’s  available and more dependable than CVS. That being said - you’re already AT CVS…..you could maybe try to transition that role into something (remote!) in their corporate offices that leverages the entrepreneurship degree. Just a thought, internal candidates do sometimes take priority.

And no, I don’t have specific times that I have to be in class, just deadlines for when certain work is to be submitted. Occasionally there will be a test or assignment that has a specific window (for example, a test on Thursday that opens at 9am and becomes unavailable at 5pm), but that’s really nothing too bad. Unfortunately this semester I have ONE class that’s a requirement that isn’t offered online at ALL. I’m trying to work around that though so I can actually have some freedom with my work schedule/reduce transportation as it’s MWF…

"Hey ladies! Just a quick ish rant. My husband and I as well and my brother and his fiancé all live in the same city. Different sides of town but same city nonetheless. We live in an upper middle class to upper class area outside of DC so generally very liberal AND there is some general wealth needed to afford our cost of living here. My brother’s fiancé does very well for herself. Nice car, very put together, designer bag here and there but nothing outlandish or crazy flashy and same with my brother nice car, great job, doing well for himself. 

Now my brother has a 4 year old daughter in pre-k. My niece and another little girl in her class have gotten very close since last year. Well my brother’s fiancé decided why not set up a little play date/meet up, so her mom reaches out to her mom at pick up and basically long story short the mom doesn’t want her daughter hanging around so many people of higher socioeconomic status basically something about not offering enough diversity and her daughter can end up stuck up all that nonsense and turned down the play date. 

When my brother’s fiancé told me that, my mind immediately went to racism. You’re not finding a home below $750k here and the average rent is above $2500. So, I know that their family has to do well enough for themselves to even afford school in this area because that’s even more expensive here than it would be in another area with lower COL. But her as a white woman doesn’t see it that way and is like well maybe she just doesn’t like people with money and is on the side of “eat the rich”. 

This kind of makes me fear for my niece. I’m thinking she has a mom that doesn’t understand racism or ignores it. Do you all think I’m over analyzing the situation and it really is just an eat the rich classism kind of situation in an extremely liberal area?"

"That’s weird. I also live right outside of DC in an expensive city right across the bridge. Yes, homes/rent are pricey here BUT there are tons of options within the same school districts that are much more affordable. While the homes we may consider will be $3k/month in rent or $800k+ in housing cost, there certainly are rent/home prices significantly lower within the same zip codes.

So, all that to say, it is possibly this mother is not as comfortable/well off. But that is besides the point bc it is still a seemingly bogus excuse, and if it is true, it’s pretty rude and ignorant to dismiss a friendship for her kid because she wants to shied her from seeing higher economic statuses. You can’t shield your kid from everything “other”.

I had to explain to him (and later to my white and Korean girl friends) using a pen spring how coily hair stretches out to its true length when straightened and that, no, my hair didn't magically grow 7"" overnight by being blown out. Guess, who dramatically gasped 2 weeks later when I came back in with my natural coils in a wash n go that OMG I ""did a big chop"" and not to worry because the short cut looked pretty on me -_-

I didn’t think they were making fun of my hair. I didn’t even notice. This post brought this question to light.

I wear synthetic wigs in different colors and textures because I like my hair to match my outfit! I was in class one day, and a few people asked how do I change my hair “everyday.” One was a Hispanic male who looked genuinely confused (but he might have not been).

I just said that It’s a wig. One was thinking that I dye my hair every other day. That one made me think “Oh, come on.” 🙄 A black man in the class was surprised that I was transparent about my hair.

It’s a wig. If my wig is not pinned down properly and slides back, I might take it off completely (and have).

One white girl in my old university asked about my straight silver gray wig. I said it’s a wig, and she was (shocked I think) She was like how because it’s glued flat to your head.

From my experience, it’s both. Some of them want to have features that are usually found on black women, and many know they can’t compete where they don’t compare. Colorism is very prevalent in Latin America and within Latin American families. A lot of us were raised to believe that beauty is dependent on your skintone and by default that black women are beneath everyone else where beauty is concerned. Now that they’ve grown up, they realize how false that sentiment is, and it eats away at their insides. The only way they can feel better about being brought up on a false narrative is by trashing black women and women who are darker than them.

"I have a theory on this. I think the fetishization of light skin, Mediterranean looking  Latinas has contributed to the Black erasure in the Latin American context. When folk say someone ""looks Spanish"" they don't mean me. When Hollywood casts a Latina, they don't mean someone who looks like me. The conversation regarding Black Latinas is actually fairly recent. These stigmas and stereotypes are carried not only by white folks but by Black folk as well, so it was easy to adopt the ""looking Latina"" narrative, even though Latino/a/e/x is an ethnicity not a race. White supremacy and the concepts that come with it are not exclusive to the US, which I think many can't grasp. Like slavery started in modern day Haiti, but folks still think that all Latinos are mixed, which is very much not the case. Many of us are, and many of us are still very unambiguously and unapologetically Black (although that last part took a deep dive into the colonizer mentality that has everyone by the throat) 

I'll add though, that the look of terror people get when I speak Spanish is amusing, especially when they were talking racist nonsense thinking I wouldn't understand."	pwa09	reply	na	na	na	0.9993923902511597	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

Cuba was also second to Brazil in abolishing slavery.

"It all happened like a poem. I was walking in the park, away from the group. We were there for my mom's birthday. It was a hasty trip so I didn't dress nice.

Anyway, as I walked, I saw a certain color pallette that stopped me in my tracks. My brain was recognizing someone before I could figure out who. As I focused my eyes, I saw a familiar face. My ex-situationship. The one that traumatized me to the point I want nothing to do with guys. The one who made me feel not good enough even though I'm accomplished, in school, with a plan. And he's a drop-out.

And the funny part? He was walking with a girl. A thick/curvy black girl with long box braids. And even funnier? He saw me too. He showed me his two middle fingers. In an almost primal-fight or flight type of way, I internally gasped, and made a U-turn back to my mother and the group.

Almost like a poem, I leave to live in a different country tommorow. Maybe this was the push I needed to LET GO of the Nostalgia. I need to get the *fuck* outta dodge."	Mindless-Praline-577	post	17.793173302238205	female	White	0.006191921886056662	na	na	na	3	blackladies

"Alright don’t jump me but I gotta get this out. I hope someone relates.

My whole dating life people have been telling me I have a type. My response to that is a type has me!! Every man I’ve ever dated has been Hispanic or a light skinned Black man. I’m dark skinned and I like to think I’m attractive. People tell me my celeb look alike is Tems for context. I never seek men out. These are the men that approach me. I came to terms with the fact that dark skinned Black men just aren’t super into me but my friends disagree. 

So I decided to do a little experiment. You know how on TikTok LIVE you sometimes come across people rating other folks based on their IG pics? I’ve submitted my name to 15 of these lives and I’ve been keeping track of my ratings. 8 were men the same complexion as me or darker. 7 were men lighter than I am.

The average rating I got from all the dark skinned Black men is a 7.6/10. From light skinned Black men, the average rating was 
8.4/10. That’s a significant difference.

I’ve noticed this too. Usually when BM approach me most of the time it’s dark skinned BM. At first I thought nothing of it but 7/10 times they will make some variation of a comment or “compliment” essentially calling me light skinned. As soon as they say it, which usually happens early on, I’m automatically no longer interested because I know the reason why they find me attractive and I’m not dating a colorist. A few times I was wondering if that was an overreaction to these comments so a few times, when I was able to, I found photos of ex’s or if they did have a kid I tried to find a photo of their mom and sure enough the ex’s were either non-black or light skinned too.

I will say that in the rare instances a black man shows interest in me, they are typically dark skinned (and often older men who remind me of my dad 🤢🤢), but never light skinned. 

As an aside, I told my (white) husband that I can tell before a black man even opens his mouth whether he dates black women. He didn’t believe me, but we watch a lot of dating reality shows and I almost always call it (and when I’ve been wrong, it’s because the men date very light skinned or ambiguous black or mixed women). I feel like this is just a sense we all have?

"This may sound stupid but here’s my take on this. I’m speaking as a light skinned Black woman. I prefer to date dark skinned Black men. I know many dark skinned Black men who prefer to date lighter skinned Black women.

I think the reason for the preferences is what we have dealt with - colorism in our community. For dark skinned Black men this includes but is not limited to: profiling, being bullied for being dark, ties to slavery and intentional colorism by slave owners which we see continue to see the effects of now. 

For lighter skinned Black women, I think it’s similar: being bullied / told you’re not black or black enough, and there are ties to colorism that are rooted in slavery as well. 

In other words, if I have kids I don’t want them to experience what I did. Perhaps the same is true for the men. I know that genetics doesn’t work that way and my children could be any lovely hue. 

My humble theory.

Edit to add*     Self hatred is real and I think that comes into play as well. We need to end colorism. It’s divisive and intentionally so."	askaboutblu	reply	na	na	na	0.006228427402675152	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

"I can explain it. It's misogyny wrapped in colorism. Men like the ones you describe see no other value in women other than what they can provide for them sexually. 

So if they are not sexually attracted to a woman, they are going to consciously and also subconsciously commence to treating them like they are completely worthless. It will be seen in every interaction you have with those types of men. From the refusal to even make eye contact upon meeting you (assuming there isn't some sort of neurodivergency at play there) to talking over you as though you're not there or side eyeing you for merely existing.

And then you add in the fact that you remind them that they are in fact a black person who came from a black woman and there lies the extra animosity. You're a walking talking reminder that he is in fact ""one of us"" and that shit fucking kills them inside.

I wouldn't wish this type of color-whupped black guy on anyone, regardless of their race. These are the types of dudes that would go off on a tangent about how racially superior their non black woman is one minute, and then murder her in her sleep the next minute because he realized that she is in fact a sentient being whom he does not control.

"I’m a lesbian in my mid 20s. I’ve been in a couple relationships but I’m putting myself back out there again since a break up earlier in the year. However I don’t remember dating being this bad? I’m open to dating any race but do tend to be more interested in other black women.

 Yet they seem to have no interest in me. I’m on dating apps (which is bad but there’s not a whole lot of queer spaces by me to meet people). It seems like none take dating seriously.

 I get matches but when I initiate conversation they are super uninteresting like I’m bothering them or they don’t respond at all. 

They few that can keep a conversation either ghost after a few days of talking or when I suggest meeting up they give excuses and seems like they just want a pen pal.

Not to mention it seems like I’m the only one making the effort to know them i.e asking questions about themselves or try to make plans to meet. 

 I’m getting a little discouraged especially because I thought I would have better experiences with other black women but that doesn’t seem to be the case. Am I just having bad luck?"	Clear_Elderberry_852	post	31.03397431548345	male	White	0.9994930028915405	na	na	na	32	blackladies
"i'm bi and dating is ass across the spectrum for me. it strongly annoys me that so many ppl are on dating apps, even if it's reluctantly, and they don't write bios! getting to know anyone is like pulling teeth. i'm not even tired of the talking stage atp bc i havent met any ppl worth talking to in ages. 😭

I think dating sucks for everybody. Gay here, and folks only want hookup. I don’t judge, but that ain’t my style. Plus I don’t smoke weed, which lots of folks in my age group do. And I’m an atheist, which lots of Black queers cannot relate to….they still religious.

"I found my partner in my DMs when I was going to delete the OKC app because I was tiredddd. 

😅 but yes, I found that bi/pan girls and lesbians who primarily dated masc women suck at conversation and I think that’s because they’re used to playing the role of being the prize. This is probably a terrible generalization but it’s sadly my experience lol.

I think a lot of us like to feel chased and desired to a degree and it should go back and forth. But based on how we are raised women generally aren’t good at chasing or making people feel desired. 

Most conversations felt like I was interviewing someone. Never really asked anything about myself unless they were returning a question I already asked.

People are also very much against meeting in person for dates? Like if I try to have a conversation, my understanding is if it goes well for a bit, why not arrange a time/place to meet in person, and go on a date like fully functional adults.

ISTG! That shit never fails to amuse me. The shackles of religion are some many of our brothers, sisters, and enbys will not be breaking in our lifetime. Like, imagine subscribing to a religion that calls you an abomination and tells you you’re going to hell for loving who you love? The religion that was forced on your ancestors and used to justify their slavery and abhorrent treatment. Their solution? Some mental gymnastics of just asking for forgiveness for the shit they’re not gonna change. I refuse to let that be me again.

"It took having loads of experiences to identify what I want or didn’t want but the basis is that I remain rational, but it can be easy to be too rational that your detachment is dangerous. It’s about a healthy balance of boundaries and letting go. When I get too emotional, my brain switches to rational. It helps me avoid a lot of embarrassment. 

First, be rational and secure in yourself. Know who you are and what you desire, what makes you happy, sad, etc. What principles you have and your dealbreakers. Never hesitate to remember these when dating. If someone ghosts, remember it’s never a reflection of you, it’s always of them and their assumed inability to communicate and commit. You wouldn’t want those in a partner anyway, so grieve if you need to and move on to the next. Remember there are always other people out there for you, no matter how long or arduous a road it seems to get to them. 

Make notes on the person you’re dating with a pros and cons list and weigh if the pros list is worth the cons list. Unless you have a clear winner of a pros list, you probably shouldn’t want to commit long term to them. Date for fun if you want though. Keep note of all the things they did wrong, and what it stems into. Decide if you want that behaviour long term. 

Second, set clear boundaries. Remember these are for you, controlling of your own actions. If you overstep your boundaries, realise that this invites hurt if things go wrong but also bliss if things go right. It’s a risk threshold you decide, and the bad or good consequences are all your doing, it won’t ever be someone else’s fault. 

Third, validate your emotions. It’s okay to be swept up in the moment. It’s okay to take some time to fall for someone. You love how you love and you should never make yourself feel bad for it. Love to love, don’t love conditionally and with the expectation of it being reciprocated. When you release love into the world you feel less guilty when things don’t work out. You can say you gave it your all and now it’s time to move on. Love comes and love goes. Everything is cyclical. 

Lastly, be present in the moment and don’t worry about the future of anything too much. Enjoy that date, even if it’s only one. Have fun dancing with a cute stranger even if it’s only that night. Cherish the two months you dated someone perfect, but if they don’t want to commit, take their word at face value and move on. No amount of begging will get someone to change, the most they might do is pretend to to pacify you but it’ll come to light one day and you don’t want to feel like you wasted time. Change plans according to the current energy you’re receiving. It’s good to have a plan or dream about things but think of it as a cute fantasy until you’re seriously committed to someone."

"Me (25 ) and bf non black (23) recently started dating and we are kinda gf and bf 

Anyways I live alone and I have major phobia from insects especially flying ones , idk how that mf got in but I was laying down and I saw it flying to my face 

And I jumped from bed and ran away and closed the bedroom door , I was kinda panicking and I truly couldn’t get myself to open the room and kill that fly !!!!

So as silly as I am but anxious I texted my bf and told him etc etc and come kill it , he was like “ I wish I could come but I’m sitting with my mom watching tv “ , I know before he was at his parents house 

Anyways got a bit upset and told him I’m calling my friend to come and kill the insect , he was like “ a guy ? , you wanna make me jealous ?”

I was like “no but my friend knows I have phobia from insects” and showed him the chat and I added he’s “my guy bestie “

Then he said “ how do you feel if I invited a girl to my house at 11 am “ , I said “ you can’t come soo wtf am I supposed to do dummy “ 

He got upset and said goodnight , now who’s the asshole me or him ?

To be fair it was unnecessary to say that to him, from saying you will have a guy friend come kill it to calling him a dummy. Bugs can be scary to deal with, but if you know you live alone than you should be aware that a bug every now and then could be a possibility. It’s just not realistic to call someone every-time you have a bug in your crib. The bug can be nowhere to be found by the time the person comes over. An infestation sure or a mouse I get it ,but let’s just be fr here. If a little ass fly scares the shit out of you, I genuinely think you should see someone. There is really no reason to be afraid of a fly unless you have some deep rooted trauma that got something to do with flies. Fear is normal but some fears do need to be addressed.

"Hi everyone! So I’m 22 almost 23 and I am wondering if I am missing out by not dating more? I have not lost my virginity yet and I am starting to feel slightly insecure about it.

My main question: am I going to regret not seeking out more romantic and sexual connections when I am older?

I have never really dated because my parents are religious and quite conservative. I luckily got my own studio at 21 but I feel that everytime someone shows interest I feel some kind of inner apprehension. As if I should not be doing those kind of things. I have a great social life and I know it would not be hard as I have tried dating apps but just always chickened out or convinced myself I did not want to anyways.

I am starting two masters in September so I still have time to meet people but I find it difficult for myself to decide whether I really want to. I think partly because of my parents and how I would have to hide it from them, but at the same time I’m an adult and not religious.

There’s nothing wrong with enjoying sex if that’s what you want. There’s also nothing wrong with abstaining from sex if that’s what you want.

Whatever you do my advice to you from my experience even if you date don’t commit to someone at this age and put yourself first. Keep your freedom (being in a relationship no matter how good it is come with limitations) and independent in your early 20s. 

Also disregard society completely when it comes to sex. Sex is for you not anyone else not even your partner. Do it only if you really want to. If you have doubts then don’t do it, you don’t have to. With that said sex is also not a big deal, it’s personal but it have no intrinsic value."	dionysoursugar	reply	na	na	na	0.9926303625106812	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

It’s okay to experiment and find out what you do and don’t like. 
I think it’s important to not put a lot of pressure on yourself and do what feel right for you. Don’t worry about what anyone else is doing. 

Virginity is both a big deal, and not a big deal whatsoever at the same time. It’s how you view it. If the moment feels right and you just want to try it, that’s okay. There is literally NOTHING wrong with that if that’s what you want to do. But there is also nothing wrong with just waiting until you find the right person.

IMO, I really don’t see the appeal in having a hoe phase & having sex with all these guys. You’re just giving men who don’t deserve your body, access to your body. & 9/10, they don’t even deserve it. Keep your body sacred & only allow access to those who fully respect you & you’ve gotten to know.

"Dating and sex don't have to be conflated, don't rush yourself. I was in a similar boat with being very academically/career focused, and growing up conservative to the point that I was basically afraid of men. Didn't help that my only interaction with men in teenhood was being bullied, asked out as a joke etc. This made it difficult for me to interact with guys and my lack of experience and natural kindhearted ness also meant I overlooked a lot of red flags. I ended up being in a toxic situationship with someone who straight up told me I was fat and dark skinned and therefore insecure enough to be easy. I'll never forget that and feeling like if I had dated more and learned better boundaries, I would've avoided that trauma.

First of all, you're not behind in any way so don't feel like it's a race. Everyone goes at their own pace. I did it because I was curious and I had never really explored sexually outside of the internet. But if I could go back, I would've waited until I had a committed relationship. 

Secondly, I would definitely suggest therapy or something to help you work through your feelings around sex/religion and any shame and guilt you might be carrying with you around it. Because that definitely makes a difference and can launch you into hypersexuality which has its own dangers.

Third just get to know yourself and your boundaries. Go on some dates, keep track of what you do and don't like that you're noticing. Actually not having sex while dating can help prevent you from sticking with someone you shouldn't because the sex is good. It can also weed out guys that are only looking to hook up and teach you how to say no and see how they react to that no. Anyone that pressures you or shames you is trash. I've learned hookups and casual sexual relationships, fwb whatever are not healthy for me personally. But everyone is different, so learn what you like and try to adhere to that. Just remember whether it's casual or not, you deserve clarity, communication and respect and to have your boundaries honored. Be ready to walk away if you don't have that.

Should you date?  100% yes.

"Okay well I (19) have an elder brother (31) who we used to have a great relationship when I was little. It was only until I was about 12 years old that my mother and brother had a huge falling out and he moved out of the house. He decided to go no-contact with my whole family, moved across the country with aspirations of being a rapper, and had a couple kids w/ his gf.

My family has tried many ways to reach out, mainly because we just want to have a relationship with his children. He would basically ignore us, change his number, but then during quarantine he randomly reached out to me. Honestly, I kind of resented him because he took his frustrations of my mother out on all of us, and I was literally a child when this all happened. But nonetheless I talked to him here and there, and he has since moved back to the same state as my family. 

Then last year, I was in the hospital for a long time due to a surprise illness and would check on me baaarely, which I don’t mind, everyone’s busy. But what got me is that he sent me a text after a while asking, “They fix the problem yet?” Like, tf? To me, calling a life threatening illness that required multiple surgeries “the problem” seemed so insensitive. However, I was just so drained for being in the hospital for too long, and also felt like expressing my feelings or saying anything opposing the man will make him ghost me again, so I just let it go.

Fast forward to now. I’m working at a clinic making some money, not a lot, but just enough for me to pamper myself once in a while. One day, my brother sent me pictures of his children, and to be frank, their clothes were not in the best condition, very ill-fitting, and I’m not even sure if my brother is doing well financially based on this. I suggested hanging out with my nieces because I’ll be going off to college soon and he said “I’ll let you know”…. he never let me know. I decided to buy some birthday gifts for his daughters because I’ve never had the chance to do anything for them and I have nothing against them. I asked for their clothing sizes (I forgot toddler clothes usually go by age lol) and he said “Don’t worry about it, you don’t have to get them anything.” Maybe that’s where I messed up, because I didn’t interpret it as an absolute no, and also since the hangout was uncertain and the summer was slowly coming to an end, I just wanted to do something, anything, for my nieces. I bought books about our culture, dolls with type 4 hair, cute gap zip ups for school! I text him asking him if I could deliver the gifts and when/where, even suggested that I don’t even have to see him, I can just drop it off somewhere and he pick it up. No response. It’s been over a week. I even double texted this man😭😭. Idk what to do anymore, especially because I’ve already wrapped the gifts up and I can’t return them, and I really just want my nieces to have it.

Should I just let it go, maybe I overstepped a boundary? Should I scrounge through social media and try to dm his girlfriend or is that also overstepping?"	Beneficial-Wonder-78	post	31.875329877667962	male	White	0.996340274810791	na	na	na	11	blackladies
I personally think you should drop the rope. Your own mental health will suffer if you keep reaching out and getting rejected. I would donate the gifts to others who can use them. I would not DM his GF or anyone else. That would NOT be well received and your brother has proven that. Your point of contact with your nieces is thru your brother and he is uninterested in fostering that relationship.	Beneficial-Wonder-78	reply	na	na	na	0.996340274810791	weak	no	no	na	blackladies
"Sounds like your brother is dealing with some issues that he hasn’t figured out yet. The fact that you’re 19 and you cared enough to buy your nieces such thoughtful gifts—really says a lot about you… such a loving soul. 

But I will say that sometimes good intentions aren’t enough. If your brother said not to worry about getting them stuff, accept it and honor his wishes. Unfortunately, when it comes to his kids, he has the final say, no matter how unhealthy it might be for his kids to be isolated from his family. Maybe you can keep the gifts for a little bit to see if he changes his mind. If not, you can give the gifts to some other kids or return them. Also, I don’t suggest reaching out to his gf. That’s definitely overstepping and you don’t want to be the cause of any more drama."	Beneficial-Wonder-78	reply	na	na	na	0.996340274810791	weak	no	no	na	blackladies
"I think you have to respect your brothers desire to have no contact. It's not possible to have a relationship with your nieces and not have one with him at the age they're at right now and he knows that. Contacting his girlfriend would definitely be overstepping because it seems like he already said no, and as they say, ""No"" is a full sentence. I would donate the gifts. If you want, you can just let your brother know that you will respect his boundaries and that you would like to have a relationship. But that you will wait for him to reach out when he's ready. I think the fact he checked on you in the hospital means he still cares so I think if you show that you can be trusted to respect his boundaries he will eventually start to let you in.

"Wow, thanks for sharing. 

I echo what commenters have already said about allowing him his space respectfully. You’ve done what you can, and you are definitely a sweet heart thinking about your nieces on their own terms. 

However, no one can save a child from their own parents. That is one of the most difficult dynamics I’ve experienced in a family with so many elders and youngins born into a long, preexisting history they inherited with no awareness. 

With that said, you were a kid and your brother was much older, but also a kid when whatever took place. I think you owe it to yourself to advocate for what you want to be known, what you’d like to see happen, and to lay it out for him to consider on your terms. The same love and care you have towards your nieces, have some of that for yourself and do your part in that regard. Express your view (“I was just a kid and I missed being close when I was 12…”) and paint the picture of what you want to have between the two of you - so that he can take that awareness of YOU into consideration while he takes his space. 

You get to set the terms of your sibling relationship as siblings, outside of the preexisting drama that started with y’all and is seeming to trickle down with the next set of children. 

Take good care 🤎"	Beneficial-Wonder-78	reply	na	na	na	0.996340274810791	weak	no	no	na	blackladies
"I understand what you are going through. I think it’s best to go with the flow and let him reach out. Do not contact his girlfriend that will really overstep a boundary. 

My half sister went no contact with me last year. It’s a completely different situation but I’ll share. I met her a few years ago after finding out I have a different biological father. I built a relationship with my brother and he would always say she’s weird. You’ll see when you meet her. Eventually we met ( I met my brother and father months earlier), and after a few years she came around. We talked everyday for hours. I knew she was a little off as some of our conversations were out of this world. She has untreated bi polar disorder. One day my father came down here (we live in the same state) and saw her son had a gash on his head. She caused it and the family was in an uproar. I stayed out of it for the sake of our relationship and understood my brother and fathers intent on taking the kids if needed. I called over the course of a few weeks. Often letting her know if I was working in her area (2 hours away). She stopped speaking to everyone but my father because he sends one of her child support checks. I heard nothing back. Eventually I stopped putting the effort forward. Everyone says “she’s weird like that” and goes about their business. She has four kids whose lives I wanted to be a part of. All this to say….I let it go. 

You can’t force a relationship with someone who doesn’t want it. Honestly relationships should be reciprocal with the same effort and energy. 

I think you should maybe hold on to what little relationship you have with your brother. Maybe he’ll come around. What happened between him and the family shouldn’t hold a candle in ya’lls relationship, however there may be a lot of trauma there. I wouldn’t buy any more gifts for now. 

As far as my sister and I, after her ghosting I’m not interested in a relationship. I hear about the kids from my father every once in a while."	Beneficial-Wonder-78	reply	na	na	na	0.996340274810791	weak	strong	no	na	blackladies
"This sounds a lot like the relationship I had with my eldest brother. He had a rocky relationship with the family, got married in secret and had kids, but gatekeeper everyone from us. He would occasionally dangle a chance to connect over everyone's heads, then rip it away at random. He cut off my sister from seeing our nephew with no warning. I saw all this happening, so I kept my distance. Any time I tried to get closer, he would gaslight and insult me over things from childhood that were out of my control, to the point of saying I should've died as a child (I was extremely sick growing up.) kind of similar to your stint at the hospital. After that, I cut him off. He never apologized or owned up to his side of our relationship being rocky.

He only started to reach back out to the family when he had no choice (wife and kids left him). In the short time he was around, he had the audacity to say I didn't try hard enough to be close to the kids (after telling me and several of us that he doesn't want us around his children.) Like, what trying harder am I supposed to do when you made it explicitly clear you don't want us around your children?? 

Anyways, he's passed now and it's brought up a lot of complicated feelings for everyone. It's sad to say, but him passing had actually allowed us to spend time with the kids and their mom and get closer to them. Of course there's still things to work through emotionally for everyone, but the kids don't deserve to separated from their only black family bc of his issues.

Sorry for the dump, but I echo what everyone else said that you tried. It's hard to establish a relationship with the kids if he's not allowing it. Maybe take screenshots of the lack of response if he's the type to gaslight. If you know their address, you can do what my other brother did which was ship them gifts every now and again. I would be iffy about reaching out to the girlfriend as you don't know how involved he might be in that relationship or what he tells her about you all as a family. Don't beat yourself up over it though and you're sweet for wanting to try."	Beneficial-Wonder-78	reply	na	na	na	0.996340274810791	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
"As others have said, I think you should let it go. Maybe one day his kids will find out about you and reach out themselves when they are older. 

My older half sister did something similar. She went no contact with me & another one of my siblings. Ironically, we were the ones who did the most for my nephew while she was jobless & dealing with his garbage ass father. I’d buy him the things he needed after his trash ass father would send him to my house with nothing but the clothes on his back as a baby. 

She won’t tell us why so all we can do is let her live her life & hope she’s taking good care of him. My relationship with my half sister has been on and off for years anyways as our father believes she isn’t his child so I don’t beat myself up about it anymore.

I’m currently NC with everyone I share DNA with & have been since my father died 3.5 years. I will not go into the details but basically after he passed, I became aware of all of the lies that were being told both to & about me, exactly how much I’d been used/abused financially for nearly 2 decades & just who was aware of what was going on but never said anything to me because they “didn’t want to get involved”. My mother & brother were at the center of all of it. I cut everyone out of my life for my mental health & wellbeing. I moved away right after I finished high school & right now I’m literally across the country. Right before Christmas 2021, some of them just showed up at my house, uninvited & unwanted. No, I didn’t let them in but I felt completely violated. My home was my safe space & I felt like even that was being taken away from me. I said all of that to say this: “leave your brother alone. If he wants to talk to you, he’ll contact you. I understand that you want a relationship with his kids but as someone else pointed out, you can’t have that without his consent. I get it; I miss my niblings more than anyone else & when they turn 18 if they want me in their lives my heart & door will be open. And absolutely do NOT reach out to your brother’s gf/children’s mother. It’s invasive, looks like you refuse to accept your brother’s request & comes off a bit stalkerish. I promise you if you do it, it will not be well received & may result in your brother cutting contact with you. Going NC is not something we do without a great deal of thought & emotion behind it. I understand that you were young when it happened but please, respect your brother’s wishes. If he wants to reach out to you he will.

"Speaking as an oldest daughter who had to go no-contact because of my mother, I say leave him alone. For everyone’s sake. 

There’s a lot I can say so I’ll try to keep it short. The decision to go no-contact is an emotionally complicated one, and a lot of times there’s collateral damage. I don’t know your brother’s situation, but my mother would use my siblings as pawns against me. Trying to keep in contact with my siblings, despite her, had me depressed and crying myself to sleep. 

He may be out there struggling, but let him struggle. If he really wanted y’all’s help, he’d ask for it. And I’m sure the whole “we want to remedy things for the kids thing” doesn’t help. You can’t bypass the one who’s hurting because you want access to their children. Nothing ever gets fixed that way.

"So real. I have found that usually people know what goes unspoken, so it’s not a matter of confronting it always. But there is a possibility of creating the conversational conditions for someone to voice it for themselves. Not sure fire but it’s definitely worth trying and is much more effective. 

Like your sibling(s), they know what it was like to grow up under the kind of conditions you’re mentioning. A simple remembering could bring it up organically. An open ended question asking how is to be a parent now? 

But then you gotta be willing to listen to what comes and accept where they are currently at with it. The thing is having open conversations builds up the bridge between where someone is currently thinking about something toward furthering their thinking. Again, not sure fire that they will see it as you do, or see solutions you see, but they’ll be able to move in whatever direction they think they should which would be net good for them, their parenting, and you as a supporter to them and their parenting regardless. 

But your feelings as a witness are also important, and should have their own separate place of expression and opportunity to move and grow.

"I’m curious about everyone’s preferences when it comes to dating Black men with different education and jobs than you have. 

We know that Black women are currently the most educated group in the US & we also have some of the highest rates of singleness. I find that a lot of my peers struggle with dating because we are seeking someone who has the same or similar education to us, and similar job type (blue v. White collar). 

Does this matter to y’all? I have my masters so I tend to lean towards men who are at least college educated. And I work what would be considered white collar jobs, as I’ve found that blue collar jobs have less leniency with PTO & time off, which clashes with my own values around flexibility, traveling, work life balance, etc. 

Do you all find it’s hard to meet Black men who match you in these arenas? If you don’t care about education & jobs aligning with yours, why not?

Edit: I put “superficial” in quotes & it’s being misinterpreted. I put it in quotes because I don’t wanna make a blanket assumption that it holds weight for folks.

I date women so slightly different take but yes I do care. I’ve been in two relationships, both times with someone who doesn’t even have a college degree. I’m working on my second Masters right now. What I’ve realize is that in the long run our values simply don’t match up. The things that lead me to go to college and pursue graduate degrees weren’t valued by my high school educated partners. They didn’t understand my ambition, my drive, or even my perspectives. That’s not to say that you have to go to college to have ambition or drive, but it is to say that college changes your perspective. We simply had different life experiences and values and so I decided that I wouldn’t date anyone without at least a college degree. Also, I don’t want to be broke lol, and of course, there are plenty of people without degrees who aren’t broke and even doing better financially then people with multiple degrees.

As long as men get a job making decent money they’re content, but I hear more women talking about wanting to go to grad school or get another certificate.

It matters to me.  I live in the Northeast and honestly there are plenty of black men that have college education or higher here.  At least enough for it to not be an issue in dating.  I generally found more of a compatibility issue than an education issue.  My girlfriends that are single are not single because of the education issue.  I think it's moreso because they want a guy with advanced education that looks like a professional athlete and has a great personality.  I think they'd do better if they were okay with a more average looking guy.  They actually have options and go on dates with men that are interested in them.	evolasaj	reply	na	na	na	0.007244661916047335	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
Yes. Not even going to lie. Money=power in this society. When I was dating I specifically dating men who had means and that typically also came along with some level of education I wasn’t picky with their education level though. But, with the activities i enjoy doing and the circle I hang around, it would make for an easier maneuver for the man I am dating to have some degree. At best a bachelors. I knew I would eventually be marrying and having children with one of these men and wanted to make sure that me and my children would have access to the best neighborhoods, schools, opportunities, spaces and health care. So yes they matter to me. Absolutely. And they aren’t superficial. Without money, you will not get very far.

"Idk, I was raised with an emphasis on education (maybe an overemphasis lol, still working on that academic validation complex) so it's never really been something I've had to think hard about. They say you should be the partner you want to attract, so there's nothing wrong with wanting someone who has the same things you've worked for such as education and a career. It doesn't have to be a career they love, like they're climbing the corporate ladder and all this but at least be able to support themselves. It might sound harsh but I see that as pretty bare minimum. 

I've never understood or supported the whole struggle love stuff or where the woman is supporting a man who doesn't work nor has aspirations, is just sitting around sucking up the good air. Ofc situations like that can occur with depression etc, but that's why you have therapy and medication and things like that in place to help.

"Different perspective here. I am boarding school, Ivy League educated & was previously married to my Ivy League educated ex. Took a while to find what career I wanted, and did different odd jobs. I was depressed.   
During the mean time got divorced, met a blue collar worker, had a baby, and he supported me emotionally, physically, and gave me more love and kindness than the Ivy League bro could have ever given me, during my most depressed times. Even when I wasn’t working, he cooks, cleans, does my nails and hair, and just shows his appreciation every day. I stayed home with the baby and he got me a new laptop so I could study to become an engineer. And yes I make more now, but we hold each other down, and our money is each others.    
I  think that values matter, love, kindness, support, loyalty, spiritual uplift, joy, and tenderness - even the ability to listen and apologize. That’s my list.

"Education and a job are not superficial things. They’re pretty serious values and have an impact on a family’s ability to survive. Men who think these things are superficial feel that way because it’s superficial to *them*, and *they* are superficial. To superficial people, education and jobs are just a box to tick. They see it as no different than preferring someone likes the same music as them. They can’t understand why an educated, gainfully employed woman would want a man with a job other than to “take his money to spend on material things,” because they probably don’t think about maintaining a household or financially preparing for the future themselves. 

The other clapback to this is “just because someone didn’t go to college doesn’t mean they aren’t smart.” Yet I’ve actually never seen anyone say “I only want to date someone who’s been to college because they’re the only smart ones.” Higher education is a reflection of values, a reflection of opportunities, and a reflection of commitment. Plenty of smart people didn’t go to college, but I don’t choose a partner based on “they think they’re smart.” Smart doesn’t mean shit if you don’t apply it (and I’m not saying college is the *only* way to apply it). And frankly….I’ve dated enough “validate me, I’m smart even though I’ve never gone to college” guys. I’d rather date a dumb person who went, to be entirely honest, because there is no group of people with a bigger chip on their shoulder than a self described smart man with a high school education facing down a woman of any level of intelligence with a college education. You won’t even mention that shit and they’ll start moaning “ohhhhh college girl, you think you’re better than me” because you shared a fun fact you heard on TV or something. It’s exhausting and I will not do it again. 

Job wise….I’m happy to date a poor man who goes to a full time, low paying job, especially if he enjoys it. I’m not happy to date a man who won’t find regular work. If he won’t work, we won’t work."	evolasaj	reply	na	na	na	0.007244661916047335	no	no	no	na	blackladies

"I’m married but when I was dating I feel like I tried to have an open mind and dated guys from different backgrounds. But ultimately, I’m a physician and I’m married to a physician and I think I prefer this even though I didn’t necessarily go looking for it lol. I met my husband when we were both in between undergrad and medical school, studying for the MCAT, working in science related jobs. Before meeting him, I dated all kinds of guys-professionals with college or graduate degrees, blue collar tradesmen or high school graduates. Ultimately, I was looking for a guy with similar values that I could laugh with who had some level of intellectual curiosity whether it manifested through hobbies or career, it didn’t mean he had to have a bunch of formal education. I will say, I did tend to have more in common and hit it off easier with people who had more education vs blue collar guys. Obviously my husband is overall a better match because of values, personality and the way we “fit” together (not because of his profession or degrees) and those other guys weren’t because we didn’t work for whatever reason (not ever because of an education gap). But I think I have come to really appreciate that my husband and I are in the same field because medicine is such a weird world to be a part of and it’s really nice when your spouse totally gets that (crazy patients, crazy colleagues, crazy hours, etc). Which is why a lot of physicians are married to other physicians or other types of medical professionals. That and we spend so much time in training and working we just end up marrying one another lol. I’m sure if my husband were a teacher or accountant or some other professional vocation we’d be fine, probably would be better, we’d have a lot less “shop talk” at home in our off time lol. I have to admit, I don’t necessarily think that I would be super compatible with an average blue collar worker at this point but I could be wrong.

I don’t think it’s superficial to want to date someone with a degree, i think you understand at this point what kind of person you will be most compatible with and if that person is someone with a degree it’s your prerogative. It’s not like you’re saying that person must be 6’2” and above with chiseled abs (though I won’t fault you for that either lol but that is certainly superficial), getting through college and advanced degrees is pretty suggestive of a level of intellectual curiosity, drive and overall compatibility that matters when thinking about characteristics in a potential partner.

I’m still learning to pick better men as long story short, the men I’ve dealt with in the past weren’t the most educated or nice (daddy issues, yay). One I dated dropped out of high school, another dropped out of college. I tried to see past it and just focus on them as a person and chalked it up to school not being for everyone and life issues getting in the way. As long as they showed ambition, then it was fine. But I realized that it isn’t enough. I mean no harm in saying this but… black men without higher education tend to lean towards the ignorant side; so there were a lot of arguments and clashing over political views that I just couldn’t ignore. Also because I was the “breadwinner” in the sense that I had stable income and better employment options and found myself providing more than I was receiving.

I definitely agree but I dated a white man without a degree and although relatively successful, when he lost his job (hence no degree so picked over often) he didn’t really have the drive to find a new one. I tried my best to look past it and he found ways to make income but when looking at the broader picture, my life would always be unstable with him because not only could he not keep a job, he wasn’t that motivated to find one and because of no degree was going up against applicants with more experience and education than him. After breaking up with him- other reasons but this was definitely one of them, I realized that yes I will only date men with at least one degree and no I will not settle for less than that. I have my master’s degree in a field and job that will likely keep me employed for life (school employee) and I make great income with a great retirement and pension. I am asking for similar from a man. Why do I bring that to the table but I have to settle from that for a partner? My current boyfriend has a bachelors degree and has been at the same company and moved up for years. That’s not asking for much. I make $69K and I expect my partner to make the same or more than me.

I second this. Have dated people with money, well educated but sometimes they don't have relationship maturity. My current partner isn't degree educated but honestly is far better partner than those others. What I'm looking for hasn't changed but what he brings to table was something I both wanted but also didn't even at times realised I needed. It's not just lip service and when he says he actively wants to build and grow the relationship, his actions shows that and in some instances is more mature than me and wants to communicate so I think it just depends on what you want to prioritise in your partner	evolasaj	reply	na	na	na	0.007244661916047335	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

"But if you are let's say a top 10% woman and want someone on or at your level that means you want a top 10% or above man.  Men tend to date down so really if you're top 10%, he is going to be 5% to be at or above your level and interested in you.  

But you are now competing against 90% of women for his attention (because men don't care if your a engineer or cashier) and he is only competing with 5% of men for yours.  The math doesn't work out in your favor.  The math only works out if you're a below average woman as your field of men gets massive to pick someone at or above your level.  

I'm not saying go for a bum but is an ""average"" man not enough?  A teacher, a trades man, a grocery store manager, UPS driver, etc.   But is someone who works hard and treats you right.  

But if you are only interested in someone at or above you, you are overlooking these good average men.  And this then let's the men above your level look down on you and treat you poorly because they know they're in limited supply.  

And it gets even worse if you over estimate your ""level"".  

I hate all this ""level"" and dating up or down/settling talk that is more prevalent in social media around dating; shouldn't it be about finding someone who treats you nice and loves you, who cares if hes a garbage man or warehouse worker and you're a lawyer or whatever with a PhD."	evolasaj	reply	na	na	na	0.007244661916047335	no	no	no	na	blackladies

"*$171K including benefits and pension contributions w/o overtime. Feeder drivers can clear $200K yearly.

Feeder = UPS tractor-trailer (semi trucks) 

Source: I’m a UPS driver. 

Edit: I know quite a few of my coworkers over 50 who are perfectly healthy aside from the occasional cold or flu that a lot of people catch. The key to avoid breaking your body at UPS as a driver is to use seniority to your advantage. Most of the older drivers work downtown routes. The packages they’re handling are mostly small parcels and envelopes. A driver with low seniority is getting his head kicked in because he doesn’t have enough seniority to bid (and win) a cushy route so he’s in a cut car with 300+ stops working 11 hour days. The downtown guys rarely see an irregular package over 70lbs and they can walk through their package cars in the morning. 90 stops total including pickup commitments. Also using the methods we learned at Intergrad help prevent soreness and injuries which definitely prolongs your career. Being a UPS driver is a lot like playing baseball. You only have to be physically strong for a few seconds at a time BUT, you always have to make the job look easy to the general public. We take a lot of pride in that.

"This is proximity not socioeconomic classes.  Dating at work doesn't mean you are dating in equal economic classes, a paralegal dating a lawyer isn't equal economically it's dating in proximity. 

Social gatherings would be based on hobbies and or mutual friends again not economic classes but proximity.  Most social groups don't do salary checks as part of admission.  Now yes it is less likely for executives to be in the same social circles as a garbage man but it just shrinks the gaps not eliminate them.  

College would be a typical exception again it is primarily proximity (same school, but majors vary leading to varied ecomonic levels but does shrink the difference) as well.  But would find more people in similar majors dating leading to similar economic outcomes but considering the OP is post college wouldn't apply and there is a vast difference between teachers economic class and an engineer who may be in the same classes.  

What's funny is the downvotes on my main point of saying that using socioeconomic classes to determine if someone is worth dating is objectively stupid.  If you are considering them they are in your ""circle"".  But when you start saying I make X so they have to make X or more you are limiting your already small pool of your circle (wheres the line if you make 80k if they make 70k is that good enough or what about 60k or even 50k all of those are still above average salaries yet below your level).  Rather than focusing on finding someone who treats you right and makes you happy.  Someone's worth is not their paycheck or job title, but rsther how they treat you.  The original OP already knows the answer to their own question by labeling these things as superficial, this shows that they know it shouldn't matter but for some reason society says they do.

I'm not saying date a bum who doesn't work or care if you are a 6 figure earner but if you make a decent above average salary there is no reason to overlook the guy at the gym you meet if he is just a grocery store manager making average income.  

If you make an above average salary the income of the other person doesn't matter as you make enough to be secure on your own.  I have never met a man who has job or income in his list of ""wants"" in a partner but most women do.  This only really becomes an issue for women when they start to outearn the majority of men, and then it makes it much harder for them to find a committed partner as the numbers don't work out in their favor.  And this conspiracy theory that it's some hidden force trying to keep women specifically BW down is exactly that, a conspiracy theory.  If you out earn most people and are only willing to date someone at or above you, you have limited your pool of eligible people to very small percentage and it becomes a numbers game.  Cast a wider net and find a good caring man or limit yourself to the ""big fish"" and maybe get lucky, this is why the data show Highly educated BW are also leading in singleness as OP says.  If your happy being single great no worries but if you ate unhappy telling women to hold out for this ""man on their level"" typically leads to more unhappiness as they don't find him and only furthering their limited choice a they get older and more people their age get married and now they are basically holding out and waiting for these men to get divorced.

"As the title says I am afraid of being ”basic” and I think I know where it comes from. All my life I’ve been the ”outkast” or someone who didnt belong in the circle.

I am still young, 24-years-old, but the older I get the more I realize that I am just like everybody else. I know I might sound arrogant, but if you knew me you would know that I am not.

">Is there something I could do to get rid of this mindset?

Literally anything that you want. The average person chases societal norms and expectations in hope that it will fulfill them and make them happy. They get these things (or try to) only to age & realize they're still unhappy - and that's why people often seem so miserable as they get older. They have kids, get married, get a decent job - and then there's no ""out"" while they aren't exactly happy. Some just get comfortable and accept it, and others live miserably and project anger onto others all the time from the inner frustration. If you don't want to live that life, then do whatever you think might make you happy. I'm an existentialist (it's a philosophy, not a religion or anything), so I believe in living authentically. It requires self awareness to be able to know what you want, so life is a journey about finding out who you are, and it seems I'm happier than many people my age. Here's an example - if I genuinely wanted to move to Nigeria and I calculated the expenses and found out that the flight & home and foods, etc... for a few months would cost around $4,000, I'd move the second I got $4,001. Many people drag their feet for the perfect moment and life isn't like that. Also, the second you have kids then life becomes more confined, so remember that. Chasing ""big things"" is fine because you may not get there but the chase will probably give you a lot of awesome memories when you're old asf! I probably sound crazy to some people but I'm having fun - and I just started a non-profit so don't doubt your abilities!

It was fun the first couple of years, living in the mountains with all the beautiful scenery. Then a huge wave of Floridians moved up here. Winter used to be the off season where my town’s population would get cut by nearly half, now it’s packed all the time and the infrastructure is not prepared. No one smiles or says hello to one another anymore and driving is a nightmare. I never wanted to settle here but I’m stuck for now because of my job. My goal is to be out by next summer but waiting is haaard. Every day feels like a battle and I’m on my own. Long story short, I feel ya 😅.

"Hi everyone! I'm 26, graduated with a bachelor's in journalism in 2019, and I've been working in that field since 2018. I'm currently freelancing after a mass layoff in June, and this has left me with a lot of time to think about my future regarding career and educational opportunities.

For some reason, I decided to check my spam folder and I saw that the 2024 application for Columbia University is open. I've considered grad school in the past, but then life happened and I've been really well off in my young career so far. So I put off deciding on grad school. But now, I'm thinking hard about it. Not just applying to Columbia University and hoping to get in, but also applying to a local university so that I could stay home.

I've talked to my husband about it. I've talked to my parents about it. My reasons why I'm considering grad school aren't verbose or necessarily transformative. I enjoy school. I enjoy learning. I enjoy being in a community that is like me. And quite frankly, I want to go to grad school just because I want to.

Looking at my career history so far and the potential I have, I've done extremely well. I have been so extremely worried about my prospects since sophomore year of college, but my anxiety quickly dissipated once I found my footing in junior or senior year. A lot of my colleagues have their Master's, but just as many don't. 

That begs the question — to all of the beautiful educated ladies with a Master's or Ph.Ds in this Reddit, what would you suggest I do? And how do you feel about your education? Was it worth it?"	pepperhomie	post	9.309925395986172	female	White	0.0014112816425040364	na	na	na	13	blackladies
"My education was worth it because the program I went to (top 10 MBA) is specifically designed to get people into high paid jobs, and the employment reports told me that ahead of time. Not saying any other program is for sure not worth it, but pointing out that my personal risk of disappointment was low, even during the pandemic (especially since I was on a full scholarship). 

While I also relate to just wanting to learn, college is so expensive that people will generally always define “worth it” in monetary terms. And that’s totally understandable. 

That’s why my advice is to go somewhere cheap or free. Just note that his could be an expensive brand name program that gives you a scholarship, and you won’t know that until you apply. (I say this to advise you not to limit yourself to schools with a low sticker price. But you mention Columbia so I see ambition is not an issue lol.) 

If applying to schools with the intent of finding scholarships was easy, everyone would do it, I’m under no illusions. But it does reduce the need for it to be “worth” anything but your time and energy, so you can enjoy learning without that pressure."	pepperhomie	reply	na	na	na	0.0014112816425040364	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
Have you looked at the course offerings Columbia has to see what piques your interest/what might work well with your journalism degree? Me, I'm getting my master's in counseling and I'm loving it. I did Sociology for my bachelors. If you love to learn and get into something you're passionate about and will apply to a field you're interested in, I say it's a go!	pepperhomie	reply	na	na	na	0.0014112816425040364	no	strong	strong	na	blackladies
I think it’s worth it if you need to do it for personal and/or professional growth. But I think it’s important to consider financing, the time commitment, your why for pursing another degree, and if it’s something you need to meet your career goals. I feel my masters was worth it because it was something I needed to do to meet the requirements of the career field of my choice. And I honestly was only willing to do it because I was able to do so without acquiring any debt.	pepperhomie	reply	na	na	na	0.0014112816425040364	weak	no	no	na	blackladies

Poor people are just as fucked up as rich people and Beyonce is probably at home right now yelling at her kids and Lizzo is probably crying and depressed because the internet hates her.

"I feel the same way. But imma jusy play Devils advocate here. I *really* don't care about Beyonce. Shes extremely talented and an amazing performer. I just don't go all in on her like that. 

 And I went through my Lizzo phase. (I'm indifferent to Lizzo, cause I like what she stands for but I also have been feeling like for a while now that Lizzo is gonna do what she wants, when she wants. Lizzo is unapologetically herself. And I think that's fine. But I also believe that she does it despite what is in others best interests. 

Lizzo gives off energy like she expects everyone and all her friends to celebrate her ""Birthday 🎂 MONTH""

So, while she stands for great things, she can also be a ""Mean Girl"". I was in Band too...there were mean girls in the clique""

That all being said. Lizzo and Beyonce are friends. They have had a relationship we don't know about. I would imagine Beyonce is disappointed in Lizzo. But, if Lizzo is currently having some type of mental health crisis or bigger issue and Beyonce is acting as a concerned friend, she might have made a poor judgment call and felt bad about leaving out her name at an earlier show.  

Who knows. But that's just my take on it. I don't personally care either way."	Femme-O	reply	na	na	na	0.9989922642707825	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
"Well there's two folds to the TvM story: one is that both figures involved are high profile themselves. The trial was the State v Tory, not Tory v Meg. Thus prosecution was state-funded. In the Lizzo v Dancers here, Lizzo got all the money she needs in order to hire a posh lawyer, the dancers might be at a disadvantage there. Lizzo is also easily the fan favorite figure with greater influence and connections, going against that as a noname nobody with relatively little social support is scary and damning. Megan, even as a high celebrity herself, received a lot of hatred not just from fans, but from other popular hip hop bm artists. 


Secondly, Tory did try playing the money and power aspects to his benefits (the 1mil dollars bribery offers to meg's friend, continuously posting online about him being lied on, diss tracks, etc). He just fumbled it so badly that these attempts came up during the trial, and the prosecution's case was ultimately simplified. *He* shot himself in the foot. No pun intended. Tory got put away because his deception became clear and what little evidence there was lined up against him in court. So let's be very clear, **Tory's money and power weren't his disadvantages in the case, his dumbfuck, sneaky actions were.** (And the fact that, yk, he drukenly >shot Meg>with a gun he shouldn't have had with him in the first place🤷🏾‍♀️)


 In any case, in the court of public opinion Tory, while literally convicted and found guilty, is still highly supported by hip hop fans and other high profile artists in his lane, while Meg still receives hatred ""for lying"". His reputation among his peers is still largely unaffected, they see him as a victim of the system rather than a victim of his own malicious behaviour."

Some of you might know that Florida is planning to teach its youth, that black people benefited from slavery. This is very bad and I mean bad because this is is literally the equivalent of an abused father telling it’s mentally scared child that “even tho I abused you I taught you how fish” it’s ridiculous. Second of all they are trying to bring in this new narrative to make the youth especially the young black youth ignorant of their past, and to uphold white supremacist ideals on how African Americans learned skills from slavery. What I find funny is how people will always be so quick to gaslight us black people when it comes to our trauma yet they would never do this if it was the Holocaust.

"Absolutely. Anyone who is in Florida should be fighting with tooth and nail to reject this blatant racism and history revisionism. I think I read somewhere that there was a lawsuit against DeSantis and maybe the Florida government for this shit, but the response for this has been pretty fucking muted considering how abhorrent this is. 

This is largely a result of [DeSantis' STOP Woke Act](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/politics/2022/04/22/florida-governor-desantis-stop-woke-act-race-bill-law-sign-discussions-republicans/7403239001/), which is largely amounts to let's get rid of shit that makes white people uncomfy. 

However, there are black conservatives who help to curate this new ""curriculum"" as well. [Introducing Dr. William B. Allen who chastised Kamala Harris for daring to call out this fucking nonsense.](https://www.jacksonville.com/story/news/education/2023/07/25/william-b-allen-florida-black-history-curriculum-denounces-critics-kamala-harris/70461016007/) 

[DeSantis already signed a bill that rids of any DEI initiatives in Florida colleges and universities](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/desantis-anti-dei-education-law-chilling-effect-florida-rcna85646). You already know who that primarily affects. 

[The NAACP has literally issued a travel advisory for Florida as being unsafe for black people](https://naacp.org/articles/naacp-issues-travel-advisory-florida). 

For what it's worth, [DeSantis was comfortable enough to have Nazi adjacent fucks on his campaign](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/26/politics/desantis-staffer-campaign/index.html) (no way they didn't know about that beforehand) and the fact that a chunk of the MAGA crowd are white supremacists and/or basically Nazis anyway, best believe they downplay/deny the Holocaust too. 

In any case, Florida is fucked. DeSantis is unabashedly a white supremacist and fascist and while he's not gonna be President (at least in 2024), he and the white hoods in suits in the Florida state government clearly have no regard for black lives, or any life against white Christian cisgender men. 

The Democratic Party in Florida has been historically *pathetic,* especially in recent years, against the burgeoning Republican (MAGA) stronghold there. I'm not implying we lean just to politics here -- this is beyond just a politics issues -- but I'm not seeing much grassroots action against this either.

"I start school next week and I’m a bit more nervous than I thought I was gonna be. I’m the only full black person at my school.. and that’s not an exaggeration. There’s like one other girl in my grade who’s black. She’s mixed and only hangs with the rich white kids though. Not hating on her for that at all. This school does obviously have more than enough racist individuals, and is predominantly Hispanic and white. The n-word gets slung around way more than it should here. I’m gonna be a senior so this isn’t gonna be anything new, but this is my first school year at this school without wearing my mask. I honestly tried to trick myself into thinking I was still wearing my mask last school year because I was still concerned about covid (partly true) but honestly the main reason is because no one here looks like me and I’ve grown up always being taunted and made fun of by my peers. I went to school yesterday for picture day and I felt so uncomfortable, like the shy timid girl I’ve been working to NOT be during this summer. I just hope atleast that this school year will be the best one because I can not take another second of that school and it hasn’t even started yet. 

Another thing is that my parents are immigrants from Africa. I was born in the US though. But obviously my African features are more apparent  than most black celebs or influencers you see online. Something that I’ve been working on is not being insecure about that because I genuinely think everyone is beautiful and that I shouldn’t care about what others who aren’t gonna be in my life think. But I still get heavy waves of anxiety that come around. And the amount of stories and strange experiences I’ve had living and going to school in this 1% black town is unbearable."	grimripem	post	10.951322809341251	male	White	0.9983865022659302	na	na	na	6	blackladies
As someone who also hated high school and couldnt wait to leave, here is what I recommend.  Get a new hairstyle that really fits you and makes you feel confident. Get a change of wardrobe that really makes you think that you are looking great today. Plan ahead and have some good clothing styles lined up for the week that not only makes you look great, but expresses the beauty of your brown skin tone. I use to love wearing various shades of blue because it made me look great. While you may not feel it inside just yet, keep your head held high. You may not always feel confident, but you can appear confident until you believe it.	grimripem	reply	na	na	na	0.9983865022659302	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
out of curiosity where do you live? have you talked to anyone about this like your parents, a school counselor, or therapist? do you have any sort of community outside of school?

I live in Santa Barbara which is in fact a very small town off the coast in California. And due to different issues in my childhood and current life communication about how I feel and things like this is still something I’m learning to get better at. But there were times where me and my older siblings would talk about it which I appreciated. Even if it’s awkward. Something that’s nice is that for graduates (preschool, 6th and 8th grade, 12th grade and college) the city college has a sorta black graduate event where they celebrate us and that’s something that I’m looking forward to. But even then I feel excluded no matter where I am or who I’m with and at the end of the day I just have to teach myself that I’ll always have myself.

So my life has basically completely changed in the last 2 weeks. I got laid off from i job that was actually mentally and physically exhausting so I was kind of relieved. I had a planned trip for my 40th out of the country so i was just looking forward to that and getting my severance. Now today I find out my lease can’t be renewed because they need to do some work on these ceilings in the building. I had also been considering moving out of Atlanta. I don’t really have a close group of friends here, now no job and lease ending I’m fee like maybe this is a sign. I’m turning 40, I’ve got nothing holding me here and I’m pretty miserable. Would love to move out of the US but will take Denver perhaps instead. Does anyone live or know what the Black community is like there? It’s always been on my list so I’m thinking no time like the present. I feel like I’ve stayed here simply out of comfort because my anxiety does not handle change well and I’m just used to being here but know I think I’m over it. Would love your thoughts/input, thank you	Dayday2300000000	post	28.319639698792496	female	White	0.9989463686943054	na	na	na	2	blackladies
"I moved from ATL to Denver and I love it. My career really took off here, there’s so much to do for a low key person like me, the people are nice, traffics not that aggressive (I like to think it’s because everyone is high lol), and it’s super progressive. There are career opportunities everywhere, and many businesses (especially the startups) are all about diversity and finding people who don’t have the ‘typical’ background. The only thing Denver is missing is a good strip club, but I guess we can’t have it all 😂

I will say it took me a while to get used to often being the only or one of two black persons at an event. But there are plenty of us here and we often look for and find each other. There’s meetups, black owned dance studios, black owned bars and speakeasy’s, plenty of stylists, etc. We’re here and enjoy each other very much - you’re kinda grateful when you meet another black woman and she knows what a twist out is lol. 

ATL was great, I like to say I found my footing there. But I got into my stride in Denver."	Dayday2300000000	reply	na	na	na	0.9989463686943054	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

"I (>35M, for full transparency) recently saw a social media post stating something along the lines of ""if you ask men what love is, they'll list chores"" and I def don't dispute the general social and systemic spirit of the statement, but it made genuinely curious what love looks/sounds/feels like to women, Black women in particular.

So what is love to you? What does it look like for someone to make you feel loved? In what ways do you want to be loved/how? What is a ""loving space"" for you? How do you show/give love to/on others?

Bonus question: Any thoughts on separating loving someone from the act of re-enacting ""roles"" learned in (often traumatic) childhood wrt emotional attachments/connections (or lack thereof) with parents?"	Sqeeter	post	18.389251001786615	female	White	0.004866770468652248	na	na	na	6	blackladies
"I’m currently feeling loved in my relationship due to how my partner:

- Always discusses things with me like we are on the same team. It’s never “You do this to me and I don’t like that” but always “This is causing an issue in our relationship so let’s see what we can do to change it for *us*”

- They nurture me where I’m flawed instead of trying to change me. My ADHD makes me very forgetful, something that I’ve been shamed for in every relationship and by family. But they never once made me feel bad for forgetting anything and actively remind me with gentleness if they know it’s something I’ll probably forget. 

- They remain curious about me. Asking me things about my interests, they hate trash tv but I love it but they’re always genuinely interested in what I’m so excited/emotional about when watching things. They don’t want to watch, but want to hear from my perspective what’s happening and actively engage, joke, and ask questions. Same with my hobbies!

- They’re always willing to lighten the load if I’m stressed, even in the smallest ways even, always asking how they can help me. 

- They always bring me a gift when returning from errands, whether it’s candy or a random rock that made them think of me 😂"	Sqeeter	reply	na	na	na	0.004866770468652248	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

"I (25f) just need to rant.
So when I was 13, my front teeth were protruding slightly and even though ‘Chipmunk’ was a cute nickname, my parents foresaw that it could worsen over time.
So during my regular check up, I raised my concerns with my Russian dentist. This lady looked me in my eyes and said that ‘your bone structure as a black person’ means protruding is ‘normal’ and corrective procedures such as braces were unnecessary and a waste of resources (in the U.k. it was free for children). 
Like an idiot, I took her word for it and continued with my life.
Well, now guess what? I need braces to correct the protruding.
I am so angry. This is going to cost me £4,000 plus added expenses since I’m doing it privately to get it done as soon as possible. Firstly, I am not wealthy. I just started my career, having been in education for such a long time. Cost of living crisis means less disposable income. 
Secondly, I already look quite young and it’s been a battle for my clients to take me seriously once they meet me in person. I think the braces will just be a social hindrance.
I want to sue. I want throttle my younger self. I’m mad at my younger self for hearing this crap, ignoring the feeling that what was being said sounded dodgy and instead of getting a second opinion, I accepted it."

"Hey just a quick perspective check...


As a 13 year old there's no way you should've been expected to make pertinent medical decisions.  That was your parents responsibility. It isn't your fault that you trusted the expert. That's literally what you're supposed to do. And your parents deserve some slack as well since again they're supposed to trust expert opinions as well.  


The one who messed up here is that doctor.  That's the only person you should be upset with.

I left r/BlackPeopleTwitter after the post about black men and their role in the patriarchy got removed. I liked that social issues could be talked about along with comedic posts, but I hated how one sided it was. Every time there was a post about a black woman being homophobic, biphobic, transphobic, or making fun of men for doing something that is stereotypically feminine, all the men would be in the comments with their hot takes about black women as a whole and everything wrong with us. But the rare times a post would come up critiquing black men, they’d all be in the comments dismissing it as a “gender war” post or not even acknowledging the post and just commenting “so what are y’all eating for dinner,” and such. And I’ve noticed for a long time that every post that critiqued a black man or black men would always inevitably get removed, but I guess the one about their role in the patriarchy was my final straw. I wish there could be another sub like r/BlackPeopleTwitter that isn’t just comedy, but also talks about social issues in both men and women.

Also, I’ve been seeing this theme of bashing Black women for a while and I’m not even on social media like that, but I’m am starting to see it more and more in everyday life outside of social media. I have reddit and YouTube and the hate towards Black women from people, regardless of gender and race, is astonishing! 

Recently came across a YouTube short of a Black woman bashing Black women for not getting married right out of college like some yt women (it was a video of yt women at graduation showing off their engagement rings). The Black woman said, “the reason Black women don’t get married right out of college is because Black women are below reproach and only want people that will validate our bad behavior”. 😒🥴 

Baby, when I tell you the comments were filled with Black men agreeing with her and saying this is why we are passport bros! Lol. And of course some Black women and nonBlack people as well. 

I personally think it’s a matter of priorities, cultural differences with marriage, and finances. Not everyone has the privilege to afford a ring and wedding at 22-23 years old. Not everyone goes to college for a Mrs. Degree, but for the actual degree that they paid hundreds of thousands for lol.

I need to get back into therapy but I'm considering a non black therapist. Here's where I need advice. 90% of the tine I love having a black woman therapist. But at times I feel like she relates too hard and isn't impartial. Sometimes I kind of need a reality check that all my family dysfunction is in fact dysfunction and not just the way it is. She's also told me I'm so strong for dealing with things and it seems like a compliment but it feels invalidating. 

Obviously this isn't just cause she's a black woman. Plenty of black women therapists will be more objective and offer grace, but I'm not sure if I'm overthinking it. On some level she feels like an auntie too so I don't want to disappoint her which isn't really a great dynamic. I appreciate her so much, but idk if any of y'all have had a similar experience.  Did someone outside your cultural background provide more neutrality? Was it worth it? TIA."	FoxThin	post	31.203947511868083	female	White	0.004980010446161032	na	na	na	5	blackladies
"I switched from a black woman to a white man, a rural white guy who loved hunting and came from a self described white trash family. 

He was an excellent therapist for me and a good match and never made me feel othered or have to explain context to him. I think it depends on if the issues you're tackling are intertwined with racism and the black experience/perspective. I was dealing with chronic illness baggage and he understood and related deeply and was very very helpful."	FoxThin	reply	na	na	na	0.004980010446161032	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

My therapist is a white woman and I love her lol. She was recommended by my psychiatric nurse who is a black woman. Clearly, she doesn’t understand what it means to be a black woman, but as a therapist she seems to understand the emotions I deal with and ways to cope with them. If I really need a black woman’s perspective, I know I can talk to my psych nurse, though.	FoxThin	reply	na	na	na	0.004980010446161032	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
"If the therapist is good at their profession then you’ll be okay even if they are from a different demographic.

If they aren’t then it won’t matter if they are black.

Sometimes it is cathartic to explain the situation and give context. If you are in immediate crisis thet may be some hard work you don’t need to put on your plate.

Also, start writing an intro for yourself with said context for each an every type of healthcare provider.   Have that ready so you don’t have to do emotional heavy lifting while vulnerable.  Sadly, it helps slap providers into the fact that I am human and they have to ask more than assume."	FoxThin	reply	na	na	na	0.004980010446161032	no	no	no	na	blackladies

"My sister (Mary) and I have different dads and I only met mine later in life where a year later he has been in hospital for 3 and a half months and in the ICU for 6 weeks. It's really complicated where my half sister (Willow) on my dad's side has cut contact with me since he ended up in the ICU which meant I was kept in the dark about his whereabouts and condition which lead to me complaining to the hospital and gaining information from 3rd parties. I am now able to see him but Willow has cut me out (I don't really care about her so it's not an issue as I just wanted to have a relationship with my dad).

W's mum (ex wife of my dad before I was born) messaged me asking me to let her know if I want to come to the hospital to visit in future...
My dad being in hospital is horrible but the added complexity with the other sister (W) is jarring so I've given myself a break from going to the hospital.

Mary knows all this. She asked me 4 days ago if there's any updates and I said no I'm going to have a break because of how messy everything has become.

However, yesterday she brought it up when we were out with our partners. She was asking me to recall what happened with the hospital, and asking me how often I'm going to visit. Will it be every few weeks? She asked. Asking about the strained relationship with W. Her partner even asked why they're keeping my dad alive 😳

I felt incredibly uncomfortable retelling what happened, where I wasn't able to visit, his condition etc. and having to repeat that I'm having a break from visiting.

Everyone who was present knew all this already so I don't know why it became a topic of conversation.

I messaged her after and said that I felt uncomfortable talking about this yesterday where I'd never volunteer to do so in that setting and felt sad and awkward repeating myself and highlighted that she was up to date with everything. I said in future I will let her know if there's any updates. 

M replied ""Totally understand, noted, sorry for causing any distress see you soon xx""

I don't feel like that she did understand at all there was no emotion in her response. I don't think she realises that this was inappropriate. 

I'm still really upset. Am I just too sensitive lol?"	londonlady1992	post	20.650596018704018	male	White	0.998318076133728	na	na	na	8	blackladies
"You have the right to call her out and still be upset at her for bringing that up to other people, besides the two of you. That was wrong completely and she should've known better. 

However, I think you're taking her response too far because you feel betrayed and you're upset at her. I understand that you're upset, and you have a right to be. You have to take into consideration that this was done via text, so you can't properly understand what tone she meant unless you do this in person. She could've meant all the things you said she did, but you won't know unless this convo is done face-to-face.

"Okay, no your sister is a b!tch and it honestly sounds eerily similar to some bullshit my sister and other heifers pulled after our dad died but it was different subject(s) to get in my business or in my sister's face, make me her punching bag.

She's doing that to, in her mind, rub it in your face that you're in a hurtful situation because she probably has insecurities surrounding her feelings/relationship with her own dad and it makes her feel good that you're ""suffering"" with Willow shutting you out, Willow's mom being an asshole and the chaos of your dad being very sick. Doing it in front of an audience means she can put you on the spot and humiliate you. People come out of a BAG when people die/are in hospital.

What I would do in this situation is cut Mary and her equally messy boyfriend TF off and focus on your support system. That's what you need right now. I would not answer the phone for her ass and I would tell her unless she has something urgent or business related to talk about, don't call me. Any of these ""I feel uncomfortable"" conversations is just fuel for her to either put it back on you as the problem (like you're questioning yourself now) or for her to be delighted she hurt you. No ma'am.

It sounds like your dad is gravely ill; think about what you really want to do in his last moments or in the event he pulls through how you want to be there for him in recovery. Mary is a non mf factor in that. If you and your boyfriend can be on the same page about not talking to Mary at all and especially about your dad (including her attempts to fish for information, because she will) then that is the best case scenario. If that's too much for you and you still have to see her, just stonewall her (look at her blankly and hold it). It is just so inappropriate, insensitive, rude, mean and frankly classless to do that someone going through a hard time. I really feel for you and I'm very sorry you're going through this.

"Thanks for your reply!

To clarify, the ex-wife messaged saying I need to let her know if I wanted to come visit was so it fits in with her and W's schedule instead of me freely visiting which I have been doing for weeks with my partner. I have been visiting a few days for a few hours a week it wasn't overboard. She was not messaging me to be nice and she never had my number, it was W who gave it to her so that's why I decided to have a break as I only want to see my dad, not have drama and gatekeeping over something I have a right to do (visit).

Editing to add: my other sister M was completely aware of this all so asking me to recount (in front of a group now) how I found my dad at the other hospital he was moved to, and asking when I'm going to resume visiting again and how often, when I'd told her just 3 days before our meeting that I'm having a break was not nice."	londonlady1992	follow-up	na	na	na	0.998318076133728	weak	strong	no	na	blackladies

I definitely think I'm going to have a break from Mary for a while. As for my dad, it is so sad seeing him sedated and with machines helping to keep him alive.

"These kinds of situations (a loved one being sick, death, etc) are emotionally volatile and I don’t think making a major decision like cutting Mary (who it sounds like you have an otherwise great relationship with) off is a good move at this time. Be intentional and clear in your close and familial relationships right now, there’s a reason people note these times as the ones where you see people’s true characters come out. 

I don’t think you’re being too sensitive, I think Mary’s behavior was weird & inappropriate. I also think her text was apologetic. She didn’t grovel but she acknowledged hurting you and noted it for the future. 

Since it seems like this is still really bothering you, I would have another in person conversation like someone above recommended. She hurt you so it’s natural to assume her intentions were bad, but you love her, so give her the benefit of the doubt and ask her why she brought it up flat out “hey, we spoke three days before in depth about what’s going on. is a there a reason you brought this up at ____?”

Her response and/or any conversation that follows will show you whether or not she’s empathetic to what you’re dealing with as a whole, what her intentions were in discussing your private business publicly, and whether or not she is genuinely sorry about doing that. I think those answers will either strengthen your relationship or cause you further pain at a bad time in your life. If the risk of the latter is too much for you right now, maybe try talking to Mary less (if at all) about your dad, spend less time together if necessary, and save the deeper convo for the future.

Just what the title says. I feel lonely. A lot of the time it feels like we aren’t allowed to talk about wanting a relationship. It always gets met with “love yourself first”, “occupy your time with other hobbies”, “you’ll meet someone when you least expect it”, etc. Not to say those things aren’t true but seeing the amount of GREAT women (beautiful, funny, nice personality, smart, good career, etc) struggle to find a partner is daunting. I’m not really even looking for a full blown relationship (though I welcome it if it happens). I’d really just like someone to spend time with when our schedules permit, travel with and just see where it goes. It feels like these men want us to chase after them these days or give them an instruction manual on how dating works. It’s exhausting. I’ve made a really good life for myself and I know I should be “happy” with or without a partner. But I’m going to use this safe space with my internet sisters to say.. I’m lonely.

"Ok so i have hiv. Im very lonely and have put up with shitty relationships because of this. Currently I am trying to not be in this position which means I've had to cut off friends with benefits that were at least giving me attention only because they had other people they were dealing with . I'm not putting myself in a situation anymore where I'm going to be a side chick for somebody that doesn't care about me . However, I hate when people say oh you'll find it when you least expect it because every single time I come across somebody that I'm interested in that genuinely seems like they're not a horrible person, they end up rejecting me because of my status.

I also just moved to a new town and I have no clue how to go about meeting new people. After being here for 2 years I know two people in my local area, and the third person nearby, but this weekend I was frustrated cuz I had nothing to do. I reached out to plenty of people to ask to hang out and nobody was available and it gets frustrating.

It's hard enough that I feel Undateable, but I don't even have friends to hang out with to make being Undateable more bearable.

A lot of people tend to ignore that humans are social beings, and when you take that aspect away from somebody it's going to hurt no matter what that other person does. Now some people need more or less social contact than others, but I really hate when people try to say oh I shouldn't be lonely because and list whatever reason why my feelings are invalid when they're not.

"Even as an introverted nerd, I feel this post and the replies so much! And the ""just love yourself/it's better to be single"" crowd usually don't have problems getting dates/interested people in the first place so I feel like they'll never *truly* understand. Besides that, self-love does not and cannot substitute for the romantic love that can come from a partner. I could love myself and focus on my health, career, and other goals but still be lonely because I have no one to share the achievements/accomplishments with.

On a side note, I feel like people who give that ""love yourself"" advice just don't want to invest the energy needed to talk about the overwhelming loneliness that some people feel.

"Girl same, took the words right out of my mouth. College was the only time I didn’t feel lonely bc I was always in the proximity of kids 24/7 with anything to do. 

Now I work a basic Office job, go to work and come home, repeat M-F. I can’t even bring myself to be interested in dating bc I’m in Ohio (but for much longer) and there’s nothing to even pick from. I take myself to the movies when I can, I take jogs on hiking trails, I go to bookstores and video game stores, I never meet anybody, not even a potential associate or friend. I engage in my hobbies, i play my videos, read, write, chill. Nothing comes from it besides time passing. I would have to seriously settle/dumb myself down if I wanted to stop being lonely.

I was literally crying about this the other day. I believe it was Thursday or Friday. I just broke down. This stage of life is lonely. I feel like most friendships/relationships I’ve had were superficial. I wasn’t in the best situation in 2019, and I changed a lot because of said situation, and it made it harder for me to connect with people. But then I wonder if I’m the reason why those relationships are superficial? I don’t know. I crave someone to just go through the motions of life together. We don’t even have to date. I just want companionship from time to time. Let’s explore a new state park together or go try this new restaurant together.

"I'm in my early thirties and after leaving an industry that forced me to be social, I realized that none of the people that I considered as friends saw me as anything except a sounding board. Being mindful of this made me shed off so many friends but even though I'm lonely, I've decided not to settle or mistake crumbs for genuine connections.

I want genuine commitment both from friends and in a relationship. I want to plan trips, go on dates, and spend my time with someone with no straying eye. I want to build a future and know that I'll live forever in this man's heart and memory and he in mine after I see my last sunrise.

I have a couple of close friends struggling with loneliness and I honestly don’t know how to help. We hang out and spend as much time together as possible and I always try to “show up” for them when they need me…but I know that none of this is a replacement for romantic love and intimacy.

"A friend talks online often about the many different types of love. Society glorifies romantic love as the cherry on top of a good life. But she talks often about how platonic love is her cherry. I see her actively cultivating friendships and being very open about her need for social connection. It’s not for everyone, I’m definitely not that transparent on SM, but it’s been an interesting thing to ponder. 

Many of my single friends have amassed a “girlfriend crew” that they travel with, go to concerts with, go to museums and restaurants with, etc. They’ve also gotten very focused on what THEY want to do. I’m not sure where you live but my married with kids me sometimes envies the freedom and experiences they’re able to have. 

I think it’s valid to say that you’re lonely. But I think you have more solutions available to ease that than just a romantic relationship. So figure out if there’s a way for you to satisfy your desire to have someone to travel with even if you don’t end up partnered. In life, we’re all trying to make the best of what’s available to us, even if it’s not our first choice. Sorry to be so blunt, I’m sure my words are not eloquent. I remember feeling like you feel now and realizing I couldn’t control someone falling for me so I had to find my way to happiness and peace even if that never materialized for me. 

I also think COVID made the loneliness even more of a problem due to the need to mask and avoid people. My platonic relationships are struggling to recover from that."	Cultural-Magazine-66	reply	na	na	na	0.03488216921687126	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
"It’s crazy that this popped up. I feel lonely. And I’m married…

I had a baby 8 months ago and it feels like I’m doing it alone. He doesn’t come to bed at night because he is gaming or is on social media or something. He is checked out, I guess. He been this way for a while since getting out of the military. 

So I’m struggling. I WFH and care for baby (he does not want to hire in home sitter) and he stays home and doesn’t do much. House work piles up. So if I’m depressed or wiped out, he takes no initiative. 

I’m not used to this. My dad wasn’t like this. My family was all very involved in cooking, cleaning, etc. We don’t like seeing people suffer. It’s like my husband don’t care. 

At this point, I wouldn’t mind if he left. I’d feel less lonely if he did. We have no family here, so I’d probably visit my family often with the baby so I can have support. 

When family visits I don’t feel so overwhelmed. When they leave, I feel like I’m suffocating. Prior to pregnancy I did a lot on my own. He just wants to stay home and game. I like playing games too, but not all day/night 7 days a week. Idk. And all he wants to watch are streamers. Says my shows/movies are stupid (until his cousin says it’s good…) 

Right now, and probably for most the marriage, he doesn’t care to satisfy my love languages (quality time and acts of service). 

It so weird to feel lonely but to also have a “partner.” If I want a break I have to leave the home. Because he will give her right to me as I’m trying to cook, clean, work, whatever. 

I communicate but he wants for me to be like “the black women in his family.” So being aggressive, nagging, assertive. I didn’t grow up like that. In my family we didn’t really need to ask, it just got done. Or we didn’t need to ask twice (of course when we were teens, yea, but other than that no). I’m passive, ask once. I even did what my therapist recommended and gave him daily tasks, nothing! 

I also don’t have many friends because we moved to this new state during COVID. And to be honest, not many people that I encountered were interested in building friendships because they put their family first (I respect that). So meeting up and such just didn’t happen. I’m meeting people here, but they aren’t at the friend level yet. I do go to meetups, yoga, etc to enjoy activities with other people. Hopefully build friendships that way."

"I feel the same and personally I feel it's common in our community for people to tell us as black women we shouldn't't care too much about wanting companionship - just be happy striving for success and so forth. On top of society with this screwed viewpoint we have to focus on loving ourselves FIRST. Get yourself together FIRST. Like there are rules for finding companions and so forth and that's not how it works. You literally have to go about it the way life works for you and you only. 

It's also known that there has been a loneliness epidemic since COVID and the rise of social media. There has been a huge shift in how people function regarding social cues and context.

And yes a shift in dating has happened too. It's way more difficult now, on top of how socially acceptable it is to ghost. 
It does feel that so many men need to be taught how to date or want to be pursued..etc and I agree. Or they just don't want to put in the effort to date or really get to know a person. 

In my experience I try to indulge in my hobbies and things that make me happy. But it does feel monotonous. Even making friends is difficult and I'd love to have a sisterhood of friends more than anything else. 

I'm thinking I'll be alone forever and trying to come to terms with that .
 Sometimes I'm so lonely I feel physical pain. It's just really difficult no matter how many things I do to try to ease the feeling. At the end of the day humans are naturally social creatures and there is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting companionship.

I'm honestly wanting to move and feel it might help a bit to go where there are more people.more activities..etc more things to do in general and putting myself in those spaces will allow me to meet people."	Cultural-Magazine-66	reply	na	na	na	0.03488216921687126	weak	strong	no	na	blackladies

It’s hard. I get discouraged sometimes, and don’t find the “love yourself” and “you never know what’s going to happen” responses helpful. Yeah, you never do know. Which means you don’t know it *will* and that sucks. I’ve done a lot of work on me in a lot of ways and I still can’t make solid friendships or find the right partner and I don’t have as much faith that I’ll ever find the intimate bonds I always assumed I would make. It’s hard not to internalize it, and yet I’m told at every turn that I’m all these good things, which then makes it harder to believe the things they’re saying because if I’m so great then why do I have this problem??

"I feel lonely a lot too! That being said I am happy that I moved out of my home because that wasn’t helping at all.

Anyway I realized that I missed the boat for making friends (let alone a relationship)- I missed the boat at work, where most people make their friends, by being late all the time and consequently a jerk (the don’t shit where you eat attitude worked against me and it’s too late to fix it now. I am working on it because lateness isn’t cool at all but it’s not gonna help friendship wise.).

I also realized that the typical avenues have a lot of barriers- having a consistent activity is a bit difficult when working all the time, bars/clubs/black community events, heck a lot of events, are more for established friends to have fun- not when you’re trying to make new ones, it’s hard for me to connect with people in general, and I realized that not all skinfolk are kinfolk to put it lightly (I had an obsession over the past year of needing to “have black friends”, and realized how the concept of that was so misleading). People forget who I am in meetup groups 😖 (it’s exacerbated because I look different now :/). I also now hate going out alone- it just makes me a target for unwanted interactions. 

I’ve tried a lot of things in the past year with lukewarm results so I’m reevaluating things.  I always felt like going the route that everybody else goes has never worked on me- this may be the same. The problem is definitely with me.

"I know it’s not the same, but I relate. I have an autoimmune disease that causes abscesses and I’ve basically been draining pus out of areas that you would not want pus to come from for like 5 years. 
Friends are accepting because they don’t have to sleep with you. They just like you because of your personality. However, men are visual and I look really cute with clothes on (as long as my draining hasn’t messed them up) but I know if the clothes came off they’d be disgusted. Hell I’ve scared the surgeon who was cutting the abscess out before.

I dated a guy when I was at my bottom who I would have never chose if I felt like the people I liked wouldn’t deny me and dating him was so terrible and traumatic that I just decided that I’d rather go after people I actually like and face rejection to hopefully find my person in the mess versus dating someone who was trash and they still fuck me over.

I don’t eat out, I haven’t had sex in awhile (cause again the draining) and I still don’t know how to even explain that I have this thing that isn’t contagious and I’m doing all the right things to take care of myself but they may still run from.

My aunt dated shitty men because of her HIV status (she got it from her husband in’86) and being with them literally killed her. Not the HIV. She didn’t want to be alone. So I feel you. I’m sorry you’re going through this, but I do hope that you keep trying even with all the people who will say no. If there were men willing to have you as a side chick even with your status then there is definitely someone who will love you wholeheartedly and loudly with your status. I’m glad you chose you cause fuck those people for compromising your health and their partners health.

As for friends, I have heard it’s harder as you get older. People are just kind of flaky. I’ve held on to the same friends I’ve had since I was 14-22 and when I try to make others they don’t get as deep. I am finding that I need new ones tho cause I’m changing and they’re not.

"yea i found a lot of healing once i listened to a podcast on loneliness and it’s emotional and psychological effects. it’s existentially terrifying to people so we have a lot of mental defenses about it, and the condescending messages is one of them. a lot of people essentially victim blame bc they genuinely believe the world is so just and fair that if something is hurting you then it must be because you earned it. 

but the truth is the worst person you can think of is someone you know right? like they not only
know you but likely know other people who like them more than you do. loneliness isn’t a punishment to the damned. it’s a random series of life events that you have to cope with, like a thunderstorm. 

some people are trying to help by badly offering coping skills (focus on yourself, etc) but i think those responses fail when they imply that loneliness is a state of mind or when they try to achieve some result besides acceptance and self forgiveness (cause the world has taught us to blame ourselves if we are lonely)"	Cultural-Magazine-66	reply	na	na	na	0.03488216921687126	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

"""One hard truth is that every great person, is not a great partner. Some people show up vastly different in relationships than they do day to day.""

Y'know what - it took me until just this year to realize that my Mom is single+alone not just because she ""had a bad picker,"" which is what I told myself for so many years.

I'd think to myself, ""my Mom is such an amazing, loyal, hardworking, beautiful, funny person, she deserves to have a person who is good to her."" 

But I also overlooked how much my Mom manipulated me because that's how I grew up. I'll skip over all the details, but I've come to really feel like Mom didn't have a bad picker - the good ones had some common sense and saw the red flags and went running. She probably couldn't keep a ""good man"" and was left with f boys. 

I say all of that to say, let's please make sure we're nurturing our whole selves, getting the therapy we need (if needed), and if you are diagnosed with mental health conditions, stay on top of that so we can show up as our best selves when Mx. Right comes along. Don't be like my Mom. Most decisions I've made have been because I don't want to end up like her. And so far, it's served me well.

Wishing everyone the companionship they seek. Keep speaking positively and putting yourselves in positions where you can meet your future partner."	Cultural-Magazine-66	reply	na	na	na	0.03488216921687126	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

I was in a relationship for very long time, been out of one for a couple years now. I don’t even know if I want another full blown relationship right now. I don’t miss feeling responsible for someone else’s feelings and always wondering what’s on someone else’s mind lol I do miss the intimacy of having your person for movie nights, dates and a consistent sexual partner. I also hate sleeping alone lol. I feel like many women I talk to have the same story of doing the self work but relationships just don’t seem to pan out. Makes me wonder too.

"This is my exact experience 😭 I've been in relationships since I was 14 and I'm married now. My female friendships have been the hardest thing to maintain though I've yearned for a true best friend or even a reliable group of girlfriends ever since I can remember.

 I had to do so much therapy to get over childhood trauma that I was in denial about. I didnt sort that out until I was 26. By then it seemed like most people already had their set friend groups. Didn't help that my parents had me extremely isolated until I was 18. 

I haven't given up, in fact in talking to a few people on BumbleBFF now. But nothing sticks and I feel sad at the possibility that my friend making years are dwindling.

I have some great platonic relationships and them just being “showing up” and answering the phone I think is enough. I think no matter how you flip it friendships just can’t replace romantic companionship for obvious reasons. But also the loneliness is really a come and go type of feeling. There are days when I’m grateful to only have to worry about myself. It would just be nice that when the feelings do come for people to listen and try to empathize rather than shut you up about it.

I think a lot of us are more in love with the idea of other people loving us (romantic and platonic) more than we actually love ourselves. So, now I’m working on me. Glowing up physically, but also mentally - healing some childhood trauma that made me lack boundaries. I realized that I would be so drained from “relationships” because I would consider other, considering  their needs above mine. Thinking they had to matter more than me in order for them to “love” me. I actually started avoiding folks and self-isolating because I was TIRED of performing.

"I looked at it this way.  I have two masters degrees and my husband only has like…a years worth of college education.  I make $75k and he makes $66k, which is a difference, but I more looked at “can he pay his own bills but still treat me to nice things like dinner or a decent pair of earrings?”  The answer was yes.  I wanted someone with a degree.  When I met him, I only had a bachelors but I wasn’t getting quality dudes with the same level of education.  So a friend of mine asked me “why is it important he has a degree?  What does a degree mean to you?  The why is what you want, not the degree.”  The degree was important because I valued job stability and a steady income.  My husband has that but without the degree.

I also just started going on dates for fun.  I actually gave up finding a husband about 6 months before I met mine.  I actually went on a date the morning I met him and had two lined up the day after I met him 🤣

But I don’t think it’s a matter of high standards.  Just knowing what you want and why.  That was my issue.  I made a list of requirements and discovered that half of them really meant nothing to me.

But I also met my husband on Hinge, so not like in college or a chance encounter in the real world or anything.  I met him when I was 29, I’m 33 now, and we just had our first kid together a little over two weeks ago.  He’s now 37.

"Hi ladies! I've been a long time lurker in this sub, but this is my first post. 

So I (34F) have been with my fiancé (35M) for 6 years, engaged for almost 2 years (with the cost of... everything much less Weddings, I am not in a rush lol)

Sooo, me and hubby kinda got into it the other day. Long story short it was his day off and i WFH, so I waited until he got up so we could eat together. He dilly dallied (which he usually does, no surprise there) and my hunger grew. I was being playful while waiting for him, and apparently this is where I fucked up. When he was done dilly dalliying, he wanted to have sex cuz apparently my playfulness got him turned on. Mind you.... I'm still hungry...

We attempted to have sex, I wasn't feeling it cuz.... again... hungry...I said let's do this later when we get back. He got frustrated and said he would just masterbate cuz we won't do it when we get back cuz I'll end up going right back to my desk to work for how many hours. Which he was probably right, that's exactly what I would have done. 

Anyway, after our argument, and we talked things out, I've realized that my libido has PLUMMETED over the course of our relationship. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not expecting Honeymoon phase sex after 6 years, but let's put it this way... we had sex everyday for the first 2 years we were together, just cuz I wanted to. Now, his libido is still the same and mine is almost non existent. I'm aware a lot of it is health related as I've gained quite a bit of weight in the past year (I went through a bad depression as a result of fertility treatments, plus the medications, I'm still dealing with the ptsd from the whole experience, and I still have no kids after almost 4 years of TTC.) 

I guess my question is, how can I begin to relearn about my own sexuality? I knew who I was/ what I wanted and enjoyed before my relationship, but now I feel... lost? Like I don't know who I am as a 34 year old woman in a relationship? I'm trying to get back into enjoying sex, and not just doing it cuz it's my fertile window, but I almost don't know where to start. 

This is also strange for me cuz I was almost hyper sexual before we started trying to get pregnant. Now it's almost like anything remotely related to TTC has scarred me mentally and I don't know how to move forward."

"Sometimes sex has a mental component for us. Even if the desire is there, if we are stressed or uncomfortable, it just won’t work. Have you been to therapy or talked about your current stress and self-image? Maybe coming to a healthy place in those areas will release some space for your libido to pick up? 

Other than that, maybe try exploring what makes you feel sexy and beautiful alone first. Engage all dive senses. Putting things on that make you feel hot! Doing things that relax and/or excite you.

It may have to do with how sex was necessary for conception throughout the time you were on fertility treatments, and since it didn’t work, psychologically you no longer feel the need. A sex therapist could help. In the meanwhile, write down the things that make you feel sexy/turns you on, share that with your man and incorporate them in your lives. Be intimate without sex as well, tease throughout the day if you can. There are a couple sexy card games as well you can try.

I know I need to work on my health, and the libido issue will *hopefully* resolve itself. It's just been hard to find the motivation to take that step.

That all makes sense. It sounds like your just now having the realization and so with that I say give yourself time. The first step is always acknowledgement.

Yeah, it hit me like tonne of bricks during our conversation so it's still a bit of a shock and trying to process and understand what to do next.

Hi ladies! This is my first post in here! I live in an area where there aren’t many black people and I have a diverse group of friends. I feel like sometimes when I talk to my non black friends about dating they don’t really “get it” because their experiences are different. It makes me hesitant to share if I don’t feel seen or heard. I’ve been trying to connect with black women at work and try to go to events where there are black people. Does anyone else have this experience? If so, anything you do to try to connect more?

So I turn 27 on Saturday and I don’t know if it’s because I’m getting older but I have no interest in dating men for a while, or even having sex with them because I’ve been celibate for a while. It’s like the same thing happens everytime. we meet, text, link up (which is my first mistake), have sex and then they change per usual. I’m tired of the same cycle, at this point I’ll just have to believe that one day I’ll find the right guy. I’ve never been in a serious relationship over a year and I do want marriage and kids someday but I’m also okay with it never happening. Sometimes this life can be a bit disappointing when you’re alone.	CarefulWin1451	post	35.876581489617266	female	White	0.9985567927360535	na	na	na	4	blackladies

"Yeah, idk if this is the right place for me to be venting here but...

Growing up with strict parents that will never let me grow up is hard. It's alredy taking a toll on me.
I'm 18. My LDR boyfriend is 18 just a year younger than me, it's not a claim or a lie because I met him on a video game and asked for his age first when we were both 16 and 17. My relationship is a secret to my parents because my parents don't want me talking to ""strangers"" so really whats the point of allowing me internet access or play online forum/games??? What's the point of me having social media if I can't date internet wise? I already know my internet safety with blackmailing and other dangerous stuff (hence why I never got kik or go post on certain subreddits).


Now IF me and my current bf broke up I will consider using tinder or post on a subreddit thats all about singles dating. But I feel like that will never happen because I'm not out of the house yet until I graduate community college, get a car and a job.

I'm tired of being treated like a 6 year old!"	MoshChapel	post	6.365188763449659	female	White	0.9933152794837952	na	na	na	3	blackladies
"I wish I had saved an IG post by a Nigerian woman saying the cultural practice of restricting dating for girls until they are 18 or even have finished college is setting women up for failure. That not casually dating or having male social interactions as a young person leads to adult women who are stunted and can’t identify red flags. I sent it to my own mother (I’m in my 30s and married now but she was like this when I was a teen) and she never responded to it 🙄

Have your own life and relationships. Be safe and take care of yourself but I’ve seen enough to know by now that many if not most parents do NOT have their daughters’ best interest in mind when it comes to relationships. They put all their fears and anxieties plus purity culture if they are coming from a church background on girls and let the boys totally off the hook."

"Hi 


So this is a hottake but I don't think its any of your parents business who you are dating and I would say that you shouldn't tell them. I am 28 years old and since my teens, I know many young people who have been dating without their parents knowledge and they have been just fine. 

Date who you want to date but don't tell your parents especially your mother. Mothers can be very controlling of daughters and you deserve to live your own life without her. As long as you are responsible in terms of choosing your partner and how you navigate a relationship, you will be fine.

 I also acknowledge that since you live at home till you have financial independence, it will be difficult to date but  figure out how to do so. Also try to earn some money from a part time job eg tutoring so that you can be able to use that money to go out and have fun."

"Hi! I (32F) was recently diagnosed with Classic Hodgkins Lymphoma. I am waiting to find out what stage I have but my oncologist has confirmed that I will get at least 2 rounds of chemo. I have been wearing my hair in box braid since the pandemic. I do my own every 6 weeks or so with a few breaks throughout the year so my scalp can breathe. I’ve been natural since 2011 and working hard to grow my hair for the last 5 years. I’m trying to decide if I should just shave my head, just in case my hair is going to fall out anyway. Does the seem like I’m jumping the gun? I just keep imagining taking my hair down and it falling out in chunks. That terrifies me and I think it might be traumatizing lol.

Hi! My mom got diagnosed with lung cancer in February. I’ve heard of some people who don’t lose hair from chemo (it’s all in genetics). My mom didn’t shave her hair but it did end up falling out. It was shocking how quick it happened. It fell out within a week, and she had long hair. If hair falling out terrorizes you, then it might be better to shave it off.

Hey I’m sorry you’re going through this and I wish you all the best. Speaking from experience, I say wait. My hair didn’t start falling out until my third round. And it didn’t fall out as much as it kind of burned up at the root and could be pulled out in chunks (I played a few practical jokes in that state, I’m not gonna lie.) When I was done with chemo a few years later my hair grew back a different color and texture, it looked awesome and I wasn’t so attached to my hair anymore. Thought I would just share a few things that no one ever really talks about. Good luck, buy a separate pillow to take with you to infusions, and take Jolly Ranchers with you (you can taste the chemo, this helps mask it). Sending you all my very best top shelf good vibes.

Today I (25f) ended things with a man (31m) that I’ve been going out with for about 2 months. For context we met on a dating app in June and after the first date we hit it off. We’ve been going on dates ever since about once per week and it’s been lovely. Long story short things progressed and sex came up and he was not a fan of having protected sex with me. Said “he’s clean” and “he can show me his recent tests”

Anyway nothing happened because whenever we got the condom he’d be unable to “keep it up”. That ended there because I was adamant that it wasn’t going to happen without protection and he said he understood and he’ll never want me to do anything I didn’t wanna do yaddy yadda. We had a long talk about boundaries and what not and I thought we were on the same page.

The next day he sends me his test results via text asking me if I would consider not using condoms with him. So that was when I knew I had to end it with him. Because… why are you so persistent? Before this we already had plans to meet up midweek so I told him we’ll talk about it then. 

(The reason why I did not end it over text is because we agreed that if either of us wanted to end things we’d do it in person rather than text) 

We had a little date had dinner and some drinks and I told him that it’s never going to fly with me. Our connection and everything has been A1, a dream but this is a big big thing that we don’t seem to see eye to eye on. Especially after I thought we came to a mutual understanding then coming to ask me again feels pushy and I’m not on it. 

Ofc the conversation goes along the lines of no I’ll never wanna make you feel uncomfortable, we’re only going to do whatever you wanna do etc. I already knew this was the last time I was seeing this man because I just felt like it was a big red flag. When we parted ways I just told him I really think that this is the last time that we’re going see each other and I’ll miss him a lot. We end up having a really nice night apart from that I’m not going to lie I really enjoyed his company and I love being around him it’s a good time. 

The next day he sends me a text again asking me if by chance we do see each other again whether or not I’d consider the morning after pill or something because it’ll make him really happy not to be sexually frustrated whenever he’s with me. 

Yeah I just let him have it because???? I basically said that we’re never going to agree on this and that he doesn’t respect my boundaries and you choose your “happiness” over my health and comfort is very telling. Wdf it’s done I’m sad idk if I handled it properly. Did I let too much slide? Did I blow it off prematurely? Did I handle it right? I never question my judgment in these things but I know how he made me feel. Safe and happy but in those moments I felt uneasy and a little pressured and conflicted because he’s come off like such a kind gentleman. I’ve obviously never experienced this type before. I really liked him but I had to lead with my head and nothing else. Im sad but not that sad. We weren’t exclusive. After about 6/7 dates he wasn’t sure if he should put all his eggs into my basket and was still talking to other ppl “to protect himself” then still wanted me to be okay with him getting his lil raw dick wet? Am I a fool? This all came tumbling down in like one day lol.   

Thanks for reading if you did I just needed someone to talk to.

Edit: thanks for the support guys honestly. I think I was second guessing myself because I made this post in the heat of the moment. He appeared so sweet otherwise this just felt weird. I’m very quick to cut someone off lmao so I was a bit like hmmm am I reacting correctly here? But I’m glad I held my ground and ended things looking at the big picture it was only going to go downhill. I’m not really sad anymore, just grossed out tbh. I’ve never experienced this before but it’s wild how common this experience is. Men are gross. I’m off the apps now, for a while now actually, I’ve ran into too many weirdos lol. I’m so excited about my life right now and the person I’m working towards becoming. I won’t devote any energy towards anything that isn’t serving me. Im always going to be okay ya know. A man isn’t my end all be all especially the calibre of men these days I’ll pass for now. Lawd have mercy!

I would go get tested TOGETHER with long term partners AFTER being exclusive and using protection for an extended period. 

STIs can lay DORMANT and since he is obviously out there in the bare who knows what Mary, Jane, or Jim is bringing on board that hasn't popped up yet.

"The fact that he texted you AFTER YOU BROKE UP to continue pressuring you... That's the universe giving you immediate feedback that you made the right call, lol. 

You mentioned in your post you've never experienced ""this type"" before, in reference to him being kind and attentive. But tbh, I think the type you may have just experienced is a narcissist (or some other flavor of abuser). Him making you feel so ""safe and comfortable"" with the prince charming act (while also refusing to commit and seeing other people) and then pulling some RANCID shit like this makes me wonder if his ""gentlemanly"" behavior was love-bombing. 

I've had many similar experiences, where a seemingly ""good guy"" suddenly starts crossing boundaries and testing limits. **It is literally grooming behavior.** With that kind of stuff, ending the relationship is ALWAYS the right choice, because the whole point of grooming behavior is to get you to acclimate to having your boundaries crossed, pressed, and questioned by this person. 

Unfortunately, guys like that have a good radar for girls who ""have never dated a good guy"". (I say that as someone who spent most of my 20s very actively healing from that internalized trauma.) Their playbook relies on you being so grateful for the *bare minimum* of decency and kindness that you'll allow them to do basically whatever they want out of fear of losing ""the only person who really loves you"". But people who really love you do not treat you like that. Having a good time and feeling good around someone are like, the bare minimum of a relationship.

"Ive tossed a guy like that this year. We were dating and the guy went from talking about wanting a relationship a wife an kids, to weeks later trying to turn it into a situationship.  

He basically tried to tell me that if I ever got pregnant by him, that I should abort, cause he dont want kids right now. He literally tried to make me promise that to him, serious face and all. I dont want kids right now either, but if a serious relationship is the goal......im not running to a clinic. That stuff is for emergencies, not lil boys that dont want to grow up. (This guy made 300k a year and im on the stable modest end as a single woman with no kids, so money wasnt a problem for either of us, but given that in my head we're seriously dating......that just didnt make sense). But anyway, I left him same day, cause it was obvious he was still in his peter pan phase.  

I went home. He got irritated. He got mad and was like ""we were having fun....youre overreacting, .....you know what....youre just using me anyway"". I never asked this man for a dime, no handbags, no jewelry, not even a box of cereal. All we did was eat together a couple times a week an go explore the city together. He tried to coerce me to go back to us ""having a good time"", but I just couldnt do it. Its obvious we desired different things. These men are looney tunes.

I'm always so happy to see a younger person refuse to make the mistakes I did. Way to stand up for yourself! The man you saw during the uneasy parts WAS THE REAL MAN. The kind one, unfortunately, was the facade. Anyone who doesn't want to get tested WITH YOU, so that you can see and make sure the results are true (not photoshopped) and he can see yours, is someone who clearly does not prioritize his own health. If he doesn't care about himself, he'll never care for you. You just saw it sooner than lots of brainwashed girls do.	LisaJohn73	reply	na	na	na	0.9986061453819275	weak	strong	no	na	blackladies

"1. What makes you second guess yourself? Is he making you second guess yourself or is it something from your past? 

That’s the thing, I never second guess myself, I never question my judgment. I’m always confident in any decision that I make especially when it comes to weeding out people in my life. But I think when I made this I literally just finished talking to him and it just didn’t feel real? Because the person I saw like a couple hours ago and the person I was texting felt like such different people. A small part of me wanted to over look it because I genuinely started to like this man but the rest of me, all 90% of me was screaming girl… this is not it bffr.

2. What did you like about him?

I liked (past tense) how kind and soft he was with me. I thought he was funny genuinely made me cackle. I think what intrigued me was that he was really different from anyone that I’d ever met before and we seemed to get along pretty well. We’re from different countries, different cultures, different races and it didn’t feel like I was having a class every time but we both learned a lot from each other. We’d have these long ass dates and it wouldn’t even feel like time passed at all. He was very intentional about dating me from the beginning, which I liked, because normally guys hit you with the “let’s see where it goes” and so I would just go about my business because what? He lived about an hour away and would plan these dates in my city and come over to see me. 

I just liked being around him honestly it felt like I’ve known him for a while, very comfortable. I do not like people around me that much but something about him was different. 

But that’s all done now.

Another manufacturer called One makes a very wide selection of condoms that can fit basically any human penis.

If a condom is so tight that it hurts or restricts blood flow, it's too small. 

One more pro-tip: A single drop of lube inside the condom before you put it on will also improve sensation for the person wearing it.

And finally: you mentioned being at an age where you no longer have to worry about pregnancy with your partners. I just want to let you know, again as a sex ed teacher, that rates of STIs are surprisingly high in seniors, in part because of this exact logic. I've heard some horror stories about chlamydia outbreaks in nursing homes, lol. Also, even if you're getting full STI panels every time you go to the doctor, you literally cannot get tested for herpes unless you're already symptomatic. And herpes is VERY common, as far as STIs go. So if you're having a lot of sex with non-exclusive partners, it would still be safer to wrap it up."

If you were to let him get away with it now, he’ll expect it all the time, and the stakes would only get higher. By the time he’s beating you to a pulp (and his behavior is a huge red flag for abuse), you’d be too worn down to have boundaries, let alone being able to enforce the boundaries you once had.

">I think that you’re right I’ve never experienced a narcissist before holy shit. Very disturbing vibes. It’s actually scary how people like this exist?

It is genuinely terrifying. But, the fact that your intuition clocked this and protected you from it without *knowing* what it was is so beautiful to me. Because honestly, it is almost impossible to tell ""nice person"" from ""narcissist with nice person mask on"" unless you have a LOT of experience. And even then... I'm a sex/relationships educator and *I've* still been bamboozled by them. (Getting professional training in relationship dynamics obviously has cut down on that number by a lot, lol.) 

They tend to be extremely good liars - I think it's because, on some level, they really believe in the reality of whatever lie they're in the middle of telling. It's spooky.

"I’m tired ladies. 

Oldest child from a single parent home.
I’m a Project Manager in corporate. I also have a partner and child to care/build with. 


I know I’d have to help take care of my family. As of lately it’s been stressful when people are asking for 10, 20, 200 dollars every other week/month. I know I have to set boundaries and that’s not an issue. It’s the fear that I have about sharing my favorite moments in life on social media without thinking somebody is going to ask me for something. 

It makes me feel like I’d have to live in this quiet box just to keep people out of my business and reduce being asked or expected to share what I’ve earned. 

It would be one thing if everyone was working super hard and just couldn’t make ends meet  but what I realized is it’s deeper than that. There’s a lack of desire for better, to grow. Instead of improving on their skills everyone wants money. My partner even suggested paying for certifications.

Why do black people who finally make it out have to carry the burden of taking care of everyone!"	lovergirl_covergirl	post	36.636314937701236	female	White	0.9969244599342346	na	na	na	71	blackladies
"I see this often. It's been termed the black tax but I also see it in other communities: first generation, immigrants etc. Really any culture or society that focuses more on the collective than the individual. 

I set up a specific budget for myself and included money for family in it. A specific amount that I can afford that won't hinder my own financial progress. I don't go over that number. 

I also pretend to make less than I actually do and I don't state my actual salary for this exact reason. I keep my socials separate for other reasons as well but one pro is that they're not seeing all the things I'm doing and asking for money after. 

It feels worse bc they're family so there's this emotional aspect which is why I set a limit from the get-go. 
I don't feel bad or selfish. I need to meet my own financial goals as well and this is a controlled way to do both. 

Others also help their family look for resources instead of providing money. Are there free classes/certifications? Do they qualify for state/federal programs, etc?

"My wife and I thankfully don’t have this issue with my side of the family, but we do with hers. We’ve gotten to the point where we make over 250K as a household, sold our old house and just moved into a new one, like to travel and enjoy ourselves (and did even when we made less money)…you get the idea. Only a small set of people know how much money we actually make but people can sense that we live well. It also doesn’t exactly help that I work for a very large tech company known for high salaries and great benefits. Previously, my wife’s mother was constantly asking for money. She’s stopped trying ever since we cut contact for unrelated issues. We’ve also had multiple challenges with this with friends. Recently a friend reached out to see if I could pay her water bill. A friend also recently reached out because she was in debt and needed 2K to clear it 😳

Our stance as a couple from day one has always been that unless we’re taking someone out to dinner or drinks, or maybe making our own donations to charities or causes that we believe in, we do NOT give people money. Period. We’ve seen it create a slippery slope for so many folks and just don’t want that for ourselves.

Phrases we use include:

“We’re not able to assist at this time.”

“Sorry, we can’t help out financially right now.”

And my favorite:

“Sorry, but no. My apologies.”

And then we just go about our lives. You may feel guilty at first but only you can be in control of your finances and how you want to allocate your money and time. I am not a piggy bank, my wife is not a piggy bank, and we don’t like to be treated as such. You are not a piggy bank either so protect your peace and your wallet.

You also don’t necessarily need to hide what you’re doing on social media, either, but that can  be helpful sometimes if you feel people are making snide comments about what you do in your free time with your funds. My wife and I don’t censor what we do in social media, and if anyone asks how we fund it my answer is typically “hard work and none of your business.” But, I do have friends who hide posts on social because they’re don’t want to hear the fuss and that’s cool too.

Edit: I want to comment more on the social media aspect and why my wife and I don’t censor ourselves on social media. We do have friends that choose to censor themselves and their lives for peace of mind, but that’s never been us so we just don’t do it. I’m a firm believer that it’s not my job to manage anyone’s feelings but my own, and also ensure that our family is doing well emotionally. That’s all the obligation I have. If someone feels some type of way because they see me vacationing when they asked me for money and I said no, that’s really not my problem. If someone feels salty that I just got a promotion or award and I’m celebrating, it’s not my issue. It’s a hard line I personally draw that it’s really not my job to manage how anyone feels about me, my money, or my success."	lovergirl_covergirl	reply	na	na	na	0.9969244599342346	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

"This is information to do with as you will:

After being the bank of “KeniLF” in college and my early career years, I had a situation where a relative to whom I’d given $500 called for more 2 or 3 weeks later. When I said I don’t have another $500, the next thing I heard was “click.”  HUNG DIRECTLY AND IMMEDIATELY ON ME! Zero couth or gratitude.

Guess why I didn’t have any!  You probably guessed that it was another relative and you would be correct.  A different relative had actually embezzled tens of thousands from our “side” business that was set up to provide financial independence for the family.

Anyhow, that was my year of eating ramen and vitamin pills for a year and also the year I told them that I’d also been demoted so, in addition to having no money because of the embezzler, I don’t have extra because the job is paying less.

Now, no one gets money except very randomly - any other time, I don’t have it. The bold ones who say that it looks like I have money to spare get told to stop trying to run my wallet while I look into their soul lmao.

Sadly, stepping in for any and every minor inconvenience just cripples them and doesn’t help them.

You’ve proven that you’re a backup wallet to them.

There literally was someone in my life who worked up the nerve to ask me for $4,500 bucks and later got huffy when I said no. This person said, “I didn’t even really need it anyway. I just wanted to pay some stuff off quickly.” Another friend has asked for a much smaller amount of money and favor more than once after I said no.

"Oooh this is for me lol. I dealt with this often despite being a divorced mom of three. My mom stopped working about 11 years ago due to her “anxiety” and my dad sucks with money management and is financially abusive.  When she first stopped working she legit acted like I was supposed to step in and help her from time to time because my husband was in the military and “you know how your dad is” whenever she wanted money to feed her weed habit.  This is despite us having three kids of our own🙄.  My dad is also retired military so they know damn well they don’t pay like that. I would help if I had excess funds but it wasn’t often. Just enough to piss me off. 

Once I got my divorce she weirdly ramped up even more.  I dont know if she thought I was getting a lot of alimony or child support or what. It all came to a head in 2020 where we were arguing and she had the nerve to say “you don’t even help me with money anymore and you know I’m not working”.  I was still emotionally struggling with my divorce and in the midst of dealing with the pandemic and three kids. I went off, called her everything but a child of god and even sent her the cash app screen grab to illustrate how much more I sent her over the years vs how much she gave me/paid back.
That basically ended that. Her only social media is fb so when I post shit there I edit it so she can’t see it if just in case she starts thinking I have money to spend/give away again.

It took me a long time to find my backbone but it’s been good ever since.

Otherwise, everything else isn't a time sensitive emergency in my opinion. I don't help people pay rent; there's always someone else they can stay to live with.

"I’m gonna repeat what Tyler Perry said in a speech at Oprah’s school’s graduation a few years back. Bail out your own boat before you bail others out. He said the first time he made money, he ended up $2million in debt because he was giving his money to people out of guilt that he’d made it and they hadn’t. He said don’t do it. He said it is okay to not give away all your money. After he went to therapy he was able to set better boundaries and take care of himself financially first. His “help” to others eventually came in the form of jobs he was able to create for people to earn.

Also - project managers don’t make a fortune. I think you need to talk to a financial planner about how to ensure you are setting aside enough to retire and for your child to go to college and get a start in life.

After you do that and set aside what you want for your life (house, expenses, vacation, 401k, investments) then you can see if there is any left to loan people or contribute to their education fund. Don’t just hand out money.

Grocery stores are the one stores I don't get watched like a hawk in (except at self checkout) because they're so busy. But you are definitely not alone, I can't find it, but I'm remembering an article I read about a grocery store (I think it was owned by Amazon, maybe Whole Foods?) that replaced all its employees with computers. Black shoppers ended up having a better experience. I always wonder why people feel the need to play security guard for minimum wage and on top of it, profile based on race alone and not suspicious behaviour.

"For context: I have been at my job for about a year. It is a dream job of mine, but since I started there, I have had extreme imposter syndrome. I have become a shell of myself. But, I realize this is a me problem. Everyone at my office has been kind and supportive of me. I haven't had any even slightly bad interactions with anyone since ive been there, until today. 

I am an attorney and today I had a filing due. I brought it to the mailroom and asked the man who works in there, if he could bring it to the court today. He said no, he was busy. He was pretty rude about it and said i should have asked him earlier. Which is true, I should have. But this was my first time doing this type of filing, I didn't know before today that it had to be brought into court.  I said, nbd i would walk it myself. Then I later learned that it did not in fact need to be walked in, and i could mail it in. I bring it back and ask him to mail it in, no rush it could go out whenever (even next week). He is still being short with me (mind you, he is also watching sopranos on his iphone with his airpods in while talking to me/working). 

I leave and go back to my office. He calls me and asks if i can print a label for my filing for him. Being that he is the mailroom, this is sort of weird, but he seemed really stressed, and it was my work, so I did it. I bring him the label and he gawfs at me and says ""no room number?"" I said ""i didn't know there was a room number"" (it was to the clerk) he hands me back the label and says ""you got to give me more than this."" His tone was incredibly rude and belittling. In actuality I was doing him a favor, printing him a label. He was acting like I worked for him. 

I was so caught off guard I just took the label and went back and printed another one. I should also add more context here. At this point in the day, i am running on fumes, have been working on this motion, havent ate today, just physically and mentally exhausted. I really couldn't even muster up the energy to think of what I wanted to say back to him. The other part of this, is that this guy has worked for the office since it was created\~20 years ago. He is not someone you want to get on his bad side. This combined with, me just not feeling like myself, and not feeling comfortable at this job, really made me feel like I was between a rock and a hard place in this situation. 

I couldn't believe he spoke to me like that. But honestly hours later, I still can't think of a way I would have wanted to respond to him.  The last thing I want at this job, is for me to be on the ""mailrooms"" bad side, or for people to hear that i got into a confrontation with a mail person. Its just not that type of office. Everyone is really respectful of everyone, and I would hate to isolate myself even more, by people thinking I don't even have the couth to deal with our colleagues. I know that whatever i chose to say would have been professional, but I am just more afraid of what it would get spun as. Certainly he is not going to tell people that he asked me to print him a label and then spoke to me like a child admonishing me for not doing it right. 

To make matters worse (this is also a part of the imposter syndrome), my office is predominately white. Me and this mail room guy are one of a handful of minorities. 

I am in my 30's and have worked in my fair share of offices. In the past I would have said something about it. Now I didn't, because everything i wrote above. A part of me is really upset with myself, i let someone speak to me like that. But a part of me just also thinks I did the right thing. I am not steady on my feet enough there, to start being a part of some office drama that this could have easily escalated into had i said something (unfortunately I have been an unwilling participant in work dramas that have started in a similar nature, on more than one occasion). I know how these things can happen, and I really don't want to be anywhere near it. Even if it means, just ignoring it. I am very torn. 

Thanks for reading, any thoughts are welcomed, especially bc i want to be prepared for the next time with him. Because obviously there will be. "	Sslover29	post	27.796842035501278	female	White	0.9990891218185425	na	na	na	5	blackladies
"Wow.  This is tough.

Why don't you have a legal assistant/paralegal/secretary to be that middleman between you and the mailroom?  That is what they are there for, IMO.

"I would focus more on the filings rather than this guy. If you want to remain valuable to the firm, it would seem to be much more important to know things like whether you need to file in person or through the mail and the proper procedures for each. If you mess that up, you're gone whether or not you are getting along well with the mail room staff. 

I'm not trying to minimize your annoyance with guy, it sounds justified, but still should not be in the front of your mind.  You want to establish a reputation as being detail oriented and having enough wherewithal to get the job done even if it means doing menial tasks like printing out a label. No one will be interested if something goes wrong and you start talking about the mail room guy. Obviously life would be better if your support staff was actually supportive, but that's on him. He's not doing his job and ideally others will recognize that. The trick is to make sure that they don't value his contributions more than yours.

"Sorry this happened to you. If you have to work with him regularly, I would try to find out what might have caused that reaction. Is he usually rude to you or your coworkers? Sometimes people are overworked and feel underappreciated, and most of their interactions with people in more prestigious jobs feel transactional. For example, no pleasantries, no small talk, no getting to know you, no consideration for existing workload, just ""hey, can you do this for me?"" and goodbye. I don't know what happened here, but as someone who's been on both sides of the fence, I try to build relationships in these situations because people get dumped on a lot and they are more likely to help me if I treat them with consideration.

"Hello, as the title says, I think I have too many white friends. First of all I want to mention, that I live in an European country. There arent many black people here, although we do have some kind of community.

Growing up I was quite introverted, shy and had social anxiety. I did have black friends and still do, but not as many as I would like. The reason I hanged out with more white friends is that they were slightly more nice. I was bullied a lot around people in my community (especially boys) that I never really got in it. I also got bullied by white kids. 

Because of social anxiety, bullying and being naturally introverted, I usually had like maybe one or two close friends. Now that I am 25 I realize that I have only one ”close” friend who is black, and also other two that I would consider acquaintances. The rest are white girlfriends, about two that I hang out or interact with. 

I think I have more white friends for these reasons: I live in an European country that is basically 99% white. Therefore for example in college, the nee people I met where just white. I also feel like the white friends that I have are more emphatic and kind. Some of the black friends that I know from the past have strong opinions about something and are not willing to think about other perspectives. I also feel judged with the past friends about my life choices (what career I want to do, who I want to date, where I live). And in no way that I am saying that white people in general are any better, is just that in my observence I feel like the white friends I have right now are more open. 

Because I have mostly white friends and a few black friends, it sometimes fucks me up. Obvoisluy there are moments where I feel like they dont understand me, but that happens with anyone to be honest. But I constantly struggle with my identity. Sometimes I feel ashemed that I have so many white friends. I even dont want to post anything on social media because of shame. I dont know where the shame comes from. I guess I feel like people will judge me for hanging out with white people. 

Can anyone relate?"	nikkion9	post	15.44554439919672	female	White	0.01875966228544712	na	na	na	12	blackladies

"I'm from a majority black country (also bullied in my youth, woo!) - but when I went to Canada to study for college, all of my friends there were white and Asian because that was the bulk of people. 

While there were a handful of black people in my program I was friendly with and happy to have nearby, none of us ended up as besties. Honestly we were probably only friendly like that cuz we were all black, otherwise we would have been some random girl/boy in the class... Cuz we weren't super similiar besides skin colour. It would have been forced for us all to hang out.

Now that I'm home, most of my friends are black. If I move to Switzerland or something, I'd expect most of my friends to be white. If I moved to Japan, they're gonna be Japanese. 🤷🏾‍♀️

That said I do think spending time in a black country or area elsewhere may help you with your insecurities.

I can somewhat relate. I’m American but growing up in middle school most of my friends were white. I grew out of only surrounding  myself with white people. I just wanted to be around people that looked like me and could relate to certain experiences. Not even negative racial experiences,  but just cultural experiences. For the most part, I am assuming your friends respect you which is one of the reasons you are still friends. But if you want to meet other Black people in your area have you tried looking online for meetups or events? Maybe try some apps meeting other black women and grab some lunch or anything? I’m not sure what popular apps you guys use over there, but just an option. Don’t feel bad for who are you friends with.

When my grandmother passed away, I decided to work on my relationship with my mom. I am an only child and was raised by my grandmother and pastor. My mom was a bully to me , I remember my first heart break my mom laughed at me and said “that’s why you got played”. Fast forward to now I have my own child. My grandmother was very active in his life and when she passed my mom decided to take over that role. I am appreciative of it all. Now unfortunately, it’s like I can’t raise my child without something being said . My child is picking up bad habits I don’t want but I can’t parent him because as soon as he don’t like my rules he run to her. Now here is the kicker , this is the first year I asked my mom for help financially . Unfortunately, I’m going through a divorce (thankfully it’s not messy) , I lost my job , facing eviction etc . I am coming into a pretty hefty lump some of money in which suppose to be paid today , but unfortunately it changed to tomorrow so I wasn’t able to pay her . I explained this to her and guess what she did call me a liar !! SMH today I decided once I pay her back I will go back to never talking to her again . And I’m okay with that. I will never kick someone while their down . Especially your only child. She know everything going on and still find a way to be little me . Of course the trauma is far worse I won’t speak on but it’s a pretty messed up childhood and she just overlooks it all. Her money is her child and I will let her and the money be happy together.

By the time I was finished paying fees to the bank, most of my paycheck was gone.  Then she got angry that I was mad for what she did.  She told me that I was stupid for writing bad checks.

We made decisions to bring them into the world and they had no choice. Maintaining a relationship after your obligations to keep them alive and usher them into adulthood is the child’s choice.

"I (17f) recently went through a breakup of an on and off relationship of about 3-4 months. I was sad and all of that sort of stuff, but I kind of realized that he doesn’t matter. I’m young, and that relationship was just not meant to be, so whatever. I met a cute guy and we’ve been texting, and we’ve met twice in person with the company of someone else/in public over the span of about a month. 

At that point, I honestly just wanted physical stuff with him because my last relationship lacked that completely (she was asexual). I let some of my friends brainwash me and I ended up texting him asking for sex. He said yes.

I saw him yesterday and it was like that didn’t even happen! We were smiling and talking and I gave him a sketchbook because he likes to draw (and he also gave me a gift the last time we saw each other), and he drew me! I told him that I would like to be his girlfriend in the future, and he said that he would like that too.

I can’t stop thinking about how I asked him for sex, and if it was the right move or not. I feel like i’m applying all of the pressure between us. He’s the one to initiate texting most of the time, but I was the one to give him my number. I called him cute first, I started flirting first. He is a quiet nerdy “loser” guy, so I want to chalk it down to him not knowing what to do.

I honestly didn’t really care about him at first, he never really crossed my mind despite us texting, but seeing him smile and agree that we should date has me feeling all weird inside. But I can’t tell if i’m faking these feelings because I just want to have sex.

I feel like I should give my virginity to someone who I love and trust, and I feel like i’m faking these feelings so I can start doing it. I did not grow up religious, and my parents never told me that I had to wait to find “the one”, but I feel like I have to. I don’t want someone bad inside of me.

I believe that I am ready and it is something I want to experience, but I just haven’t found the right person. This guy is very calm and kind and respectful, and when I see him I want him BAD. But i’ve only known him for a month, and we aren’t even dating! I wish I could speed up the process of getting to know him so I can get to *know* him. That’s exactly why I feel like my budding feelings are fake!

My best friend from middle school gave his virginity to someone bad. He says that he doesn’t regret it at all, and he’s glad that he got the experience despite things going wrong. He tells me about how good it feels, kissing and everything and I wanna feel it too. But I don’t want to make the wrong decision or do something ill regret :("	Quick-Technology-755	post	18.044348763330675	female	White	0.002163408789783716	na	na	na	4	blackladies
Coming from someone who didn’t start having sexual relations until I was 19, please don’t feel peer pressured into sex. Sex isn’t like how they portray it in movies and tv shows. Hell, sex isn’t even like how they portray it in porn. First and foremost, wait until YOU and your partner are comfortable. The first time for many people can be embarrassing, underwhelming, and even a fun experiences (depending on how you and your partner make it). Make sure you take the necessary safety precautions (make sure you both are protected, tested, etc.) There is a high probability that you may very nervous or anxious, but the more experience the more you’ll start to loosen up your feelings. Also, lastly, consent! Make sure that you and your partner both share words of consent before doing anything. Don’t ever feel forced. I hope you make decisions that feel right to yourself and your body, good luck :)!	Quick-Technology-755	reply	na	na	na	0.002163408789783716	weak	strong	no	na	blackladies
"Virginity isn't something you give somebody else. I grew up in purity culture and that kind of mindset can take folks down some toxic and unhealthy roads.

That said, sex matters. It involves trust and vulnerability. If done wrong, it can be painful and/or traumatic. It also can come with some serious consequences. 

Sex can also create feelings of closeness that may or may not exist outside the context of sex. It can flood the system with feel-good hormones and bonding hormones and lead to a stronger attachment than the relationship warrants.

If you are ready, as you are choosing your partner, you should take all of that into account. You want to pick somebody that you trust, not just somebody who is physically attractive."	Quick-Technology-755	reply	na	na	na	0.002163408789783716	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

"One valuable lesson to learn—and please learn it young b/c it makes life worlds easier—is to not make moves based upon peer pressure or how ur friends/others think ur life should be going. As a person who’s soon to be an adult, u must make decisions on ur own, regardless as to what so-and-so over there thinks.

It seems like u don’t wanna have sex w/ this guy. If it’s not an enthusiastic yes from both parties, it’s a no. 

Ppl have wrecked and derailed their lives at various ages by trying to fit in or gain favor w/ friends/society/peers. Some ppl have gotten married and had children to later regret it b/c they made the decision based on what society or their parents expected of them.

"Hello my beautiful melanin queens! So, after 9 months of waiting, I have finally been accepted as a transfer to my dream law school. It’s a T-20 school, so it’s very prestigious. 

The first school I went to was completely traumatizing. I’ve dealt with overt discrimination my entire life, but this school was wild. All of the black law students—deeply—depressed. The white law students made it clear we weren’t welcomed. One of the professors even sued the law school for trying to implement diversity and inclusion *and he won*!

Anyone, so the school I will be attending this fall is truly nothing like that. I’ve been on the campus quite a bit and met with various deans and admissions reps. The students are all smiling, admissions are all extremely helpful and kind. Like if Hallmark made a law school, it’d be this place lol

So, what’s the problem right? I come from a low income background and have always been made to feel inadequate academically (I didn’t know until my 3rd year of college that I have ADHD and dyslexia). Majority of these students at my new school come from wealthy backgrounds. Like, their parents pay for their $65K a year tuition out of pocket. Idky, but I’m equal parts excited and ready, but terrified and overwhelmed. The admissions committee and scholarship committee have high expectations of my performance during and post law school. 

I worked really hard and worked up to such a big moment and now idk how to feel. I mentally prepared myself for if I got rejected, but wasn’t prepared for getting accepted lol. Has anyone else had a similar experience, and/or general advice on how to even process this next big step in my life?🥴🙏🏽"	Fluffy_Iron6692	post	15.054368686031143	male	White	0.0015288398135453463	na	na	na	6	blackladies
Hey! I went to a top school for undergrad and also come from a low-income background. Although I don’t know where yet, I’ll be going to a top school for grad school lol. At first I struggled with this, but then when I got to the classes and the clubs, I realized I was just as smart as them. I would recommend joining the clubs there to find people like you. I doubt there isn’t a Black law students group, or maybe even a larger Black grad students group, at your school. There may be a center or resources for low-income students and it could be an opportunity to talk to similar people. Biggest thing though is to push through the doubt! Don’t be afraid to ask questions, give answers, or talk to other people even if you feel dumb or wrong. It gets easier and then second nature the more you push through it.

"I come from a similar background. Sooo many people from communities like ours have imposter syndrome. It wasn't something I realized a lot of people relate to until I started being part of clubs for back students at my PWI. That was the first time I'd ever heard of Imposter Syndrome. I truly thought it was just me, and realizing that students I viewed as exceptional felt the same way as me made me feel much better. The best advice I can give you is to seek out black (or POC, scholarship student, etc) spaces because you will find people there that relate to you, can support you, and might be able to point you other resources.

"I feel as if we are letting bigots take over an important concept because we are not more pushing back more aggressively on the real meaning of ""woke."" 

I try to challenge people to explain what they mean when they say it when I know they are using it to be racist, but it is too easy for people to duck the question, especially online. It is also a tiny effort in the grand scheme of things. I hate that more people who know the real meaning are starting to use the bigoted meaning, even when they are critiquing it. That only seems to speed up the redefinition process. 

The mainstream media is adopting it. As an example, CNN stopped saying ""the Big Lie"" because they didn't want to offend maga viewers, but they toss around ""woke"" as it suits them. 

Granted this isn't THE most important thing, but it is a thing. We have fought for years to force people to wake up to the realities of racial issues in the US and around the world. Worse still is that they are getting away with being openly racist but hiding behind a code word that they took from us. 

Is there a strategy for reclaiming the expression and its positive connotations or is it already too late?"	Intrigued_by_Words	post	39.34028526755179	female	White	0.9977138042449951	na	na	na	9	blackladies
"“Woke” is already a lost cause — the conservatives have already co-opted it and it’s fully inundated in their limited lexicon despite them being unable to properly define it ~~without being racist fucktards~~. Sorry to say, that battle has been long lost. There’s no fighting a unified conservative media ecosystem and legion of trolls online. 

By “we,” are you referring to black women or black people as a whole? I suppose it doesn’t matter ultimately. I don’t think we need the word “woke” to well awaken people to the realities of racism across the world. Despite the conservatives’ “woke” crusade, activists and marginalized groups around the world — particularly the Western world — have continued to speak out and against racial inequities. Conservatives bitching about “woke” shit was very much a thing when the George Floyd protests arose in 2020, one of the largest protests in the US [arguably] in modern times. Even regular conservative voters don’t know what the fuck “woke” means or give a fuck about it; they recognize the political creatures primarily perpetuating it are using it cynically and stand for nothing. 

Getting hung up on taking back the word “woke” isn’t worth it IMO. Focus on pushing the ideas and rhetoric that come from the traditional “woke” definition. That’s what is still permeating amongst the rest of society."	Intrigued_by_Words	reply	na	na	na	0.9977138042449951	weak	no	no	na	blackladies
The word is already far to gone imo but I actually had an interesting conversation(with myself) about how black people will try to have conversations about issues that affect us and then they get co-opted by white people who try to talk over and for us which causes those issues to become trivialized and dismissed by other non black people because they think it’s just some stupid twitter thing after our voices for our own cause gets silenced by the people that are supposedly trying to help us.

"Recently there was this woman who get called out by what I assume to be white people on twitter for blackfishing even though she was just a tan white woman(an example of white people trying to speak on our behalf when we didn’t ask for it) the conversation got to Reddit and people were asking what blackfishing was, it immediately got written off as “some stupid twitter thing that nobody really cares about”. Even though I don’t think this woman was blackfishing, it annoyed me to see blackfishing get written off as something stupid or unimportant because white people are now at the forefront of calling it out and it’s usually in a joking manner or used to call out tan white people who aren’t trying to appear black at all.

Seeing a white person call out something on a black persons behalf makes our issues trivial because white people don’t actually understand why certain things bother us.

"I agree but would also add something that might be contradictory, I'm not sure. I think white people should take responsibility for calling out other white people for their bad behavior. As a numerical minority, Black people can't keep white people in check. We need to spend our lives living and growing, not policing racists. There are just too many of them and they have too many means, official and unofficial to inflict misery on us. 

I think if you treat people with dignity and respect, there really isn't a lot you need to know about the specifics of their history or struggles in order to not make yourself a problem. Treat people as people and not objects or curiosities and you don't have to know why you shouldn't just go around touching our hair, or why it is wrong to hold a slave auction as a high school activity, or to expect one of us to step aside when passing on a tight spot on a sidewalk, or to minimize the horrors of slavery.   
So few things really need context from us when you think about it. There's no real reason they can't fix themselves. So I agree that many people don't understand our realities, but I am not in the mood to explain when the only benefit will be to treated as we should have been treated all along.

"Hello Ladies!

This is my first time I’m posting in this sub. I have searched previous posts but I couldn’t find anything on this topic. I feel this is a safe space for me to let off some steam about this. So, here we go…

I’ve experienced this. Where Black women that I have known actively allow/encourage non-Black women to be referred to as “literally a Black girl”. 

It _really_ irks me. She’s NOT BLACK! She may have mixed children, she may know how to cook rice and peas and ackee and salt fish. She may be amazing at doing canerows. And that’s cool. But she’s not Black. 

I LOVE being a BW. They should also love being whatever ethnicity they are without trying to hijack mine. 

Saying, as a BW, in a group created for BW “Oh, she’s cool - she’s basically Black” feels really insulting to me. Especially when shit hits the fan, they have no problems remembering their ethnicity very quickly in order to save their own skin. 

And when I say anything, trying to protect our space and gate keep our awesomeness, I’m told “Oh, she’s alright. It’s not such a big deal.”

Maybe I’m just way too hung up on it and should let it go. But it really takes me from 1 to 100 with the quickness.

"I look at it like this. ""Black"" can be a culture. She is likely referring to the things that are culturally seen as ""black"" rather than the race when she says that. Food, hair, all of that is a part of ""black"" culture. Now, I get sometimes it comes off as cultural appropriation, but in that case, I believe they were just saying she is actually part of the culture, not that shes racially black.

"My comment is not related to the post but this comment triggered a little irk of mine. My irk is when NonBlack people call other Black people who aren't American and live  outside of the U.S.A...""African American""...they're trying to be politically correct, because they're afraid of calling them ""black,"" but it's not correct, and it's low-key ignorant. 

Black people can be African-American but not all Black people are African-American. 

Why did that white woman feel it was appropriate to call a woman living in Australia who is from South Africa, African-American? Or better yet if she truly meant African American and not just Black. How did this white woman  believe that she could relate more to an African American than a Black woman from South Africa? 

Because a white person can NEVER be more Black than a Black person, ever. 

I remember I had a White professor share a story of when he told a colleague that he believed that Obama was whiter than he was, then the colleague responded ""Yeah, but you'll never be Blacker than him.""

Some folks forget that African-American (Black American) is more than a racial identifier. It is also an ethnicity.

"This has always been a complicated subject for me… In my mind, someone who is African-American is one who is born in America with African ancestry. My family being from Jamaica, I’ve always identified as Jamaican-American. I’m generally considered and identify as a black person, but I cannot wholly identify with many of the cultural norms of African-Americans whose families have lived in the US for generations. For instance, growing up my African-American friends ate different foods than I did or used certain terminologies I was not privy to… So for me, being “black” could apply to anyone across the globe who has ultimately come from the African diaspora in some part.

"Nah. African American most readily refers to ADOS people. 

We can talk about what’s technically true but these terms are more cultural  than literal. 

It isn’t a means of denying someone who is African, it’s just about existing as an ethic group in a country that lowkey genocides you. We are a distinct ethic group but don’t have an official name and that’s messed up, given how we became a distinct ethic group and the stripping away of our names which was involved in that. 

While both can be technically the truth, typically someone referring to African Americans here are referring to people whose ancestors were brought here from West Africa and who were enslaved here. 

And I say that as someone who is “both kinds” of African-American. I have immigrant ancestry and forced-here-in-chains ancestry and I take note of the significance of the history behind those who, culturally, are referred to as African American *because* they are ADOS. 

I liken it to the way someone just decided that anti-Semitic meant anti-Jewish. They are not the only Semites and they aren’t the majority of the Semites and they aren’t all even Semites so how is it that that term applies only to prejudice against them? It’s mad weird. But it’s cultural, not literal.

I don’t actually have a problem with people being called African American who are not ADOS, like I said it isn’t technically incorrect but when taken as a cultural term, it is. And it always be people who aren’t from here (referring to the yt lady mentioned in the earlier post) who want to assert something different."	mmsuga75	reply	na	na	na	0.011574606411159039	no	no	no	na	blackladies

"i know something is off with me compared to other people. and i recently took the raadsr  test scored a 185. i took another test that calculated autism in boys vs girl and i scored highly on that. I've had a lady diagnosed in her 30s tell me she sees a lot of her in me and that i may be on the spectrum. an ex the king of mental disorders and illnesses has said on multiple occasions that i am special. (bipolar and borderline.) i was looking up why im crying to everything and came across the hypersensitive persons page. and it correlated a lot to the spectrum. 

my cousin is Visually Impaired and autistic. my other two cousins have adhd. Thankfully my aunt is getting them meds and the proper aids for all three boys. 

In my family just about everything runs in it. my grandmother has only one known illness bipolar disorder. She has other issues and I can see it but I don't know what it is and she doesn't take meds for it.

For me personally i took borderline personality tests but i  didn't need any to tell me of my depressions  .and to my understanding autism gets misdiagnosed in black girls and woman as bd or bpd anyways. i got into university and I have access to a therapist and I will try to get a psychiatrist but it may be some time next school year. it's not something i can talk to my parents about because my mom insists that the 5 of us are fine. and when I was going through my depression patch and asked to get help both my parents laughed in front of my siblings. Other times when im going through my day and on the train I cover my ears and my mom rolls her eyes and calls me special. I told her about the time I got overwhelmed with the sliding shoes, the different language the buses and yelling, the coins clacking but everything slowed and it was kinda distorted and she ignored it. Lastly she talks a lot when she talks to the five of us and i dissociate a lot. hence my user. but she calls me dead eyes and asks me where I go and says it's creepy and annoying. 

 going to orientation I talked and talked. i noticed it but couldn't stop. i overshared a ton and i feel like when I go to school people may not want to talk to me. except for my friend who's in my small major of computer science. i knew he was autistic immediately but i didn't say anything but he mentioned his adhd and autism and i laughed with him and said i could tell. he was my first friend and I adore him. So I'm positive im autistic and i will try to get help but in the mean time talking to people who may be like me would be nice. since covid and moving abroad ive felt entirely isolated."

I never got to the diagnosis stage cuz my parents refused to believe there was anything going on with me but im sure I am. Plus as a child i had all the right conditions (my mom had me when she was older she was 42), I was so incredibly picky about food that I essentially had an ED, I used to walk on my tip toes exclusively until I was about 8, and I used a pacifier until I was 8 as well.

">and to my understanding autism gets misdiagnosed in black girls and woman as bd or bpd anyways.

It's true, three time champion here lol. But seriously I've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, bpd, generalized anxiety disorder, ocd, ptsd...at this point if I return to ask them again for another assessment they'll just throw the whole DSM at my black ass. 

I have a strong conviction that I am, if not adhd at least. I've been assessed for asd, took the raads and another one that tests subclinical presentation (forgot the name) and scored very high on both. I have a few mild learning disabilities, never learned to drive or held a job for long, I have to wear earplugs and ear defenders around the house most of the time, I'm picky with my food to the point of not eating enough(I have GI issues which is linked to asd), I stim, I have meltdowns (which according to new information presents as panic attacks), executive dysfunction like a mf, I cannot, absolutely cannot pick up on social cues which is why my friend group is small and my relationship history is even smaller, have a monotone voice, poor eye contact, hyperfocus, I could go on. Even 3 of my officially diagnosed friends vet me, but it's easier to slap another mental illness on me and shove medication in my face than really take me seriously, smdh."

"Yea I got diagnosed a couple years ago. 
I kept having severe meltdowns at work and was sent to the hospital a couple time bcus I couldn’t calm down . 

Initially I was diagnosed with bd then bd with rapid cycling , then schizoaeffictive disorder , GAD and I kept having horrible horrible reactions to the meds and eventually they diagnosed me with ASD with moderate support needs , adhd and OCD . This was after 5-6 years going in and out of hospitals bcus I would get in trouble acting out in public and had a bad drinking problem bcus I didn’t understand myself and after I took a lot of medication for stuff I didn’t have . 
It’s like they eliminated the mood and personality disorders first and then was like welp it can’t be those so you must be Autistic since we can’t find anything else to diagnose you with . 

I didn’t have to pay anything bcus i been going in and out of hospitals involuntarily so I left a paper trail 

The first person that mentioned possible Autism was my first black therapist bcus the others were white and my hyperactivity would “scare” then and they would immediately say I was manic but I never was im just naturally hyper

Although I need an official diagnosis (meaning take this with an extreme grain of salt), I really am starting to believe I am on the spectrum. I don’t want to call myself “weird” but I always thought I was too different from others in the way that I act and think. Especially as I came up through college at an HBCU. I do not think similarly to these college students in anyway. At all. Now it could be my depression and anxiety, which I HAVE been diagnosed with, skewing my mentality and perspective, but considering it runs on my dad’s side of the family and I know I’m not normal compared to a lot of girls my age, it’s all starting to make sense. Especially socially, I can NOT understand social cues for the life of me. I can’t understand romance and it makes me uncomfortable, even though I like reading romance fanfiction (weird I know), I hate change (this one is sort of Finicky), I hate eye contact. I stim (I think? I don’t know if this is my anxiety or not though. I play with my hair a lot. Pick at my nails, and always look down when nervous or confused or uncomfortable.) I can barely focus without daydreaming. I used to have bad meltdowns when I was younger, now I just hold everything in. I also have bad hyper focus/obsessions that change like seasons. Right now it’s anime and kpop lol, but soon it’ll be something else.	Dissociativebri	reply	na	na	na	0.002372738439589739	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

I guess that I may, most likely, really only just have high anxiety, PTSD, and OCD (officially diagnosed). And what I think is possible ADD…but of course unsure (no one will test me for this, they say it’s my anxiety. May be true, idk).

"well for me to know all types of stuff is diagnosed and undiagnosed in my family and several people have told me im on the spectrum it makes sense for me. and moving all the time could disrupt the change aspect since I don't like moving and being unstable and in the unknown because i believe in routines and schedule. but i know it can't be helped. and im barely sure about how im going to get college paid for, based on patterns in both my mom and dad it feels like this will blow up when I just want to go to school. which is why I said next year ill try to get a psychiatrist. getting diagnosed is an upmost privilege.

 and anyone who has eyes could see the depression and anxiety. i love being hygienic but when I do get depressed because it seems every year my life finds a way to get worst than the last. i don't brush my teeth, eat properly, change clothes for weeks at a time and my room is the biggest sign im not ok. its dirty has ants and at one time plates bowls and molded fruit. I dont like having a messy room but it hasnt be able to be helped since i was young. I lay in bed most days wanting to die. ive held a kitchen knife to my arm, ive stood on my balcony, hoping to fall forward. as a kid I prayed God would kill me. Sometimes today I still wish that a car with hit us or i drown or something. i stole a eyebrow shaver from an ex friend who i knew cuts to work up the courage to try. I've had Tylenol pm and regular around 10or 15 and I was ready to swallow them all hoping with my sleep apnea ill drift off in my sleep like my great granddad. that always sounds peaceful. I would go to sleep and hope to not wake up. that's stuff no one knows about me. and I was hoping going to college I would make some friends that would care about me. I didn't get to go to high school and my mom knows I'm 18 next year and she didn't have any plans or ideas for me. I was just wasting. So now I found a few friends that I adore and I'm scared they'll find me weird and then I'm up there alone when I was just at home alone. this doesn't even mention my life just a few years ago at 12-14 where I was online looking for anyone to care. and doing whatever they asked in hopes of them staying. or just last year my rocky relationship I stayed in because I understood he was hurt as well but not wanting to be alone. enabling him to manipulate me and hurt me more.


that's something i don't need a doctor telling me about. plus im one of 5 kids who all of us seem to have something. my sister is highly sensitive herself and likes to pull knives, talks about offing herself and screams and kicks. After she cools down in less than 20 minutes she's happy and didn't understand that she was being à demon for being told no. She is 9. 

combine the dismissiveness or refusal to accept mental health in the 5 of us with the fact we can't afford a home or car let alone a psychiatrist you get kids that grow up differently but treated like normal and they get anxiety or depression or both and can't really speak up about it since no one bothered. and I've kept a good eye on autism for 3 or 4 years so far. when I told someone i associate songs with scenarios and they feel real to me. they suggested bdp."

"Hey, so I wanted to open up about my dysfunctional family and maybe get some support.

First of all, I come from a family of eights kids and I am the oldest child. Growing up I of course then had to take care of my siblings from a young age. I didnt really get to be a ”child” becaus of this burden. It was only when I turned 18 that I felt like I might do some things without having to involve a sibling in  it. (I am 24) We had a youngest sibling from 2014 to 2021. Untill my mom told us that she is pregnant. And I was not happy at all. There were many reasons for it. 

One of the reasons I was not happy was because they already had SEVEN children, and they barely survived that. An unemployed, lazy father who hasnt held a job for more than a year in his whole life. He doesnt do much in the household. Cant cook, cant clean, do laundry, even fix basic things. Basically he is a parasite if you ask me… 
Also, we already had two mentally disabled children. They are ”mildly” mentally disabled, but still they require more attention than ”normal” children. 

My mother was told when he had my brother in 2014 that it wouldnt be wise for her to have more children, because her blood pressure is so high that it wouldn’t be good for her or the baby. They said that it would be a high-risk pregnancy. My mother also always had quite diffucult pregnancies.

So when I heard about this pregnancy I was furious. I was furious at my parents. Because to me it felt so immature, stupid and selfish, to have more children, when you cant even handle the seven ones you already have. So my brother was born pre-mature. To this day he is almost two years old and can’t sit without having something holding against his back. He is almost two years old and he cant crawl. Before when we had two mildly mentally disabled children, now we have a fully handicapped disabled child. I dont know if he will ever learn to walk. 

What makes me so mad is not my little brother, he is innocent in this matter. I am mostly mad at my father and I think because of this and other things he has done in the past, I can not respect him. How can he breed children but be childish and immature himself? How can you watch as your wife takes care of YOUR children, the household, goes to work and you do nothing? And then on top of all of this you demand respect? Because you’re the ”man of the house”. He is literally also another child my mom takes care of. 

And then my mother. I have such mixed feelings about her. One minute I feel bad for her (pity), because of my disabled brother he will probably be taking care of him for the rest of her life. That she has to do everything in the house and work on top of that. That is SO rough. And I dont know how she handles that. I think she is a superhuman for that. 

On the other hand I feel once again, anger. Why would she have anothe child again? Why would she be so selfish and basically abonden her other children? Why doesnt she stand up for herself against my father? Why doesnt she divorce my father? I swear her life would be much easier. But I know that will never happen. 

My family is a mess, people have clearly mental health issues, anger issues, nobody is close to each other. Everything is so negative. Luckily, I dont live with them. But this whole scenario makes me so angry, sad, frustrated. Theres nothing I can do. My mother doesnt listen to me when I complain about dad. She will always be on his side… but for what? What does she even benefit from him.

All of these things make me very lonely, because there is literally no one I can talk to about this. If I try to open about 10% of this whole situation to any friend,I can sense that they dont really want to listen. And only maybe one person knows about my three sibling’s disabilities. Because sometimes I feel ashamed for my family. 
I wish I had a happy, stable family. This whole family situation sometimes makes me so depressed, the hardest part is fighting with these thoughts all alone. 

Thank you if you made it this far. I just want at least one person to know my story (someone besides my therapist). Also English is not my mother language so there might be some grammar issues."	nikkion9	post	19.804777553785485	female	White	0.9986960291862488	na	na	na	2	blackladies

"Hi, so my birthday is in two months and I will turn 25. I celebrated my birthday last year for the first time in years. I suffer from social anxiety, so I dont enjoy being a host because I feel huge pressure of making sure that everyone has a good time. I am also a people pleaser, so that doesnt help either with the feeling. The birthday last year was succesful, I had about 7 people there (which is a lot for an introvert). But the people I invited,  four of them of were more like acquaintances and three of them I would consider friends. But still not the kind of friends I could share intimate things with or ”deep” things. So basically I only have one best friend, but she lives in a different city.

This year three of my friends live in different cities. And I cant rely on those acquaintances to come, because I havent really talked to them in a while. 
Anyway because of social anxiety, small circle of friends, I am not sure if I want to celebrate my birthday this year by throwing a party. Because I stress already too much about ”what if nobody comes?” or what if most people cant come.

I would love to have a birthday party because 25 is somewhat special age. But I would be too stressed if I had one. I also thought about celebrating my birthday by going on a trip somewhere. But I am not sure if I can get anyone to go on a trip with me. And I dont know if it would be sad to celebrate the birthday alone. 

Can anyone relate to this feeling? I feel so lonely in general and I think when my birthday is near, I stress even more and my lack of close friends come to my mind again."	nikkion9	post	24.962730660059282	female	White	0.991533100605011	na	na	na	5	blackladies

I relate! It sounds like your anxiety is telling you that you need more friends or at least good acquaintances in your city, and maybe you you can make that a goal for this new year of life. I would feel the same anxiety around birthdays, so I started doing 3 celebrations: 1 with family, 1 solo (I realized that I couldn't wait for people to do things and started going on trips, to shows, etc on my own), and 1 optional one with friends depending on how I felt about my social circle that year. The anxiety sucks, but you should find a way to celebrate in a way that makes you comfortable. It's your special day and you deserve to be happy on it! Happy birthday when it comes, I hope it's a great new year of life ahead.	nikkion9	reply	na	na	na	0.991533100605011	weak	strong	no	na	blackladies

"I spoke to some folks from Syracuse University, and one assembly woman who went there. They confirmed that it’s incredibly racist, hence why they left.

However I have a great chance of getting In because I took their SUPA college course and passed, I have credits for the program, done everything a college would want (we don’t talk about SATs, retaking them).

It has everything I want in a school, but hearing how they treat black students is heart breaking. Thankfully they have a divine 9, so hopefully I’d find my click of black people to hang out with. I’m someone who’s open to date any race, but after dating an ignorant white guy I feel like I might have to avoid on interracial dating at SU so I can avoid that happening again.

I just think I’m done having crushes and thoughts of dating people unless it’s clearly reciprocated. Id prefer if another person liked me enough to say something which I learned the hard way is probably the better option. It may take a while, but it shows that a presence of forming an actual relationship is actually there. Besides, they always say you find love when you’re thinking about it the least.

"I’m “conventionally attractive” and no one has ever approached or asked me out ever in my life. If anyone has ever had a crush on me, I surely have never found out about it. 

We have to shake the idea that if you just wait, things will come to you. This is what people who have always been pursued tell you because they can’t imagine that anyone may have different experience than they do. Please understand that while these people are well meaning, they cannot predict the future so they can’t guarantee you anything. 

This is even more potentially damaging advice for black women because societally we’re seen as less approachable and more intimidating, so you’re sitting and waiting for something that was already not guaranteed, and is now statistically less likely. As opposed to making a move and increasing your odds of finding someone. 

Sometimes you may have to be the approacher. Maybe all the time you have to be the approacher. And that’s even scarier as someone who has never had success in dating because you see other people having success “the traditional way it’s supposed to work” and that’s never worked out for you. So I 100% understand not wanting to make a move unless you’re sure it’s safe."	TitleRoutine2556	reply	na	na	na	0.9932094216346741	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
"I kinda run nervous and shy, so I've tried to strike up conversations with guys I was just curious about, and for whatever reason, it never turns out well. I think it's partly my EPS (excited puppy syndrome) activating whenever I meet a new person, guy or girl, and start conversing. lol So, I do get what some guys are saying about it being difficult to approach a woman but...still I prefer them approaching in most cases. IMO, it's good for them to have to figure it out. 

Sidebar: In another sub of men over 35, a bunch of them were actually in agreement they'd never approach a girl out with her friends, nor would they approach a solo lady, let's say, eating on her own in a restaurant. So, when the heck do the stars align to where you could approach, was what I was wondering. \*shrug\*"	TitleRoutine2556	reply	na	na	na	0.9932094216346741	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
"Sometimes you have to help love find you.

TLDR -- Nudge fate's hand.

Some sayings are regional. I'm not undermining it. I used to shoot my shots. Most every man was incredibly flattered and gave me a hug (once I was an adult) because there were so few attractive men in my area.  Men were not looking for me. My demographic was not desirable in my hometown, or at least not in my area of my hometown.

When I traveled suddenly I was very attractive.  I always wanted to relocate anyway so I went somewhere I was considered cute.  I didn't have to worry about approaching men anymore. One of my guy friends admires that I was willing to proactively nudge fate's hand sometimes.  (Neither a makeover nor surgery would have helped.)

Generally, it is better, in a cis-het situation, if the man politely approaches. I hired a dating coach and had to do some reading to learn this.  I was willing to do research. (Use what you got to get what you want. I was good at school, reading, analysis and taking coaching.)

&#x200B;

EDIT --   

Please remember, not all men are comfortable approaching anyone.  If your future husband is shy you'll miss him waiting for an approach.   Even if you do not actively approach you must allure.

Location is a huge factor for dating/being approached for Black women, period. There are locations that are highly averse to dating for Black women, and others that are going to be more fruitful (e.g, bumfuck Alabama vs. DC). There are studies on this. 

I only asked because I grew up in a predominantly white space that was harmful to my identity as a Black woman, and caused me to feel undesirable to men. It wasn’t until I left and went to a more diverse and inclusive setting that it became apparent that location was the issue, not me. Again, not saying this is universal, but I know many, *many* Black women have this experience. Experiences may not be universal, but they can be shared.

Okay so maybe I was approached once in my first semester, based on that experience it’s kinda a “can you help me with this work” or “do we have class Wednesday?” and then the guy will make its seem like you did something so grand to the point they ask to buy you lunch or a snack from the store. Somewhere in between they ask for a social media or messaging service username.

"I asked this on the interracial dating sub before I found this one which I think could give me better answers. 

As a Mexican I’ve always thought black women were extremely beautiful and have always preferred them over other women. My first crush was also black, so this has been a preference I’ve had since a kid. (I don’t discriminate btw, It’s just my personal preference) I also know a decent amount of my Mexican friends who feel the same way.

The problem is that I feel like black women don’t generally date outside of their race. Idk if this is mainly a preference issue or something else but I felt like I never really had the chance to flirt with black women the same way that I would a Mexican. I’ve never really seen black women in a relationship with another race, which is why I usually try not to approach them in the same flirty way I would a Mexican.

Don't fetishize a black woman, nor give into misogynoir, reevaluate any biases you and the people around you may have - that's a big reason we might not seriously date out, we already have to deal with sexism, don't try to add racism to the pot too."

"I’ve dated a Mexican! I thought he was gorgeous and wanted a serious relationship with him… sadly he was using me for sex sooo…. Fuck him but anyway I still find Mexican men GORGEOUS!

This is interesting coming from a different perspective because for me I’ve always liked brown men ever since I was a child too mainly because I grew up around Mexican, Indian, and Arabs. Now that I think about it… there wasn’t many black people in that neighborhood at all for some reason 🤔 just brown and white and then there were small groups of black families but not a lot. But Mexican families made the most impact because they would always invite me and my sister to their birthday parties and give us food. I even learned to speak Spanish because it was such a big impact on my life. 

For me I kept seeing people kind of trashing black women or when I saw brown men they were typically with their own race or white women so I kind of felt like they weren’t interested in me. If I had more men like you approach me in a respectful way I would actually be very flattered.

I go where I’m wanted but I also don’t rule out any race. I’m a big believer in your race not being a factor of how attractive you are since all races have attractive people in them. I don’t approach guys I let guys approach me regardless of race but most of the time it’s black guys that approach me. In all races people usually date within their race and usually I see hispanics stick to their race the most at least where I live. I think at least for me guys of other races are a little intimidated by me. I also keep in mind peoples families when in an interracial relationship so if the family isn’t accepting I won’t stick around. Also there’s the fear of being a “conquest” or fetishized so there’s that. So to answer your question I would totally date a mexican for the right reasons of course.

"Black women were trained to be the keepers of the community. We get scolded by black men for dating out even tho they’re doing it. How are we supposed to date our own race when they’re not dating us? Truth is we’re not. They get mad because they expect us to have nothing. We’re supposed to be bottom barrel so when other races find us attractive and we roll with it there’s anger.

I personally see WAY more of black women dating outside of their race because we’re tired. Before it was “I want a black man and black kids and a black family” but for us that looks like struggle love. It’s even been glorified in all our classic movies. It’s 2023. We like who likes us and more and more it seems to be men of other races.

Go for it. Be nice and respectful. She may be a little awkward if she has no experience dating outside her race, but maybe you’re awkward too and y’all can explain that to each other and take it slow.

pointing this out: most groups date in. We could say the same for Mexicans about not dating out.  Ive seen Mexican americans say how bringing a black person home is 'unacceptable'.  Many of us not wanting to date out due to anti-blackness is a valid reason.

I just think we rushed in; both of us naive and young, ""love at first sight"", following the ""struggle love"" narrative, false expectations, imaginations, pipe dreams, unhealthy communication, and honestly we've been sitting around for almost 10 years going nowhere as far as progression in our life together for ourselves and our family.

Hi lovlies,

I'm reaching out for advice and support regarding my dating experiences and the challenges I've been facing. Over time, I've encountered guys who make inappropriate comments about my physical appearance, particularly about my gluteus maximus, mouth, and intimate moments. These comments have left me feeling hurt, confused, and even questioning my self-worth.

I'm a petite girl, and it seems the latest potential  I'm talking to emphasize the need for me to gain weight, which has added to my inner turmoil. Even my mother has expressed concerns about my weight, adding to the complexity of the situation. While I've been trying to work on setting boundaries and prioritizing my well-being, I continue to meet guys who make these remarks, leaving me feeling discouraged.

Despite my efforts to grow and improve, I'm struggling to find genuine connections with respectful individuals. I don't want to settle for less than I deserve, but it's becoming disheartening to experience the same type of behavior repeatedly.

I would greatly appreciate any advice, support, or similar experiences you can share. How can I navigate these situations better and attract more respectful partners? I listen to self-love affirmations  and script and have my own vision board and of course been praying. Thank you all in advance for your kindness and understanding."

"I wonder if you should step back and find out if there's anything you need to work on with your physical and/or mental health if strangers and your family are worried about you. It doesn't have to take long, just check in with a neutral party (medical doctor or therapist) just to be sure you're okay.

As for the remarks, it's very frustrating. I've had people tell me that I should have been flattered, but at a certain stage in just meeting someone, when you're looking for more than a hook up, it felt gross. One, I don't know how old you are but it could just be you're at the age where the men you meet are just very young and underdeveloped as far as dating skills.

I found that where you meet people tends to matter. At school, professional events, social/volunteer groups, meeting through friends, the guys were respectful. Online or just out in the wild, was where I found guys who would just veer directly to the comments or asking for nudes. You can feel a difference between good chemistry and a nice compliment and something that makes you uncomfortable. Whenever that happened, I just explained that I didn't appreciate that at that point in the non-relationship and I was moving on. I only had one guy get weird about it."

But the recent men I met were from dating apps I prefer irl but it's been harder ( I'm Muslim and it's been difficult meeting Muslim in person especially since I moved to a new city) so this has been relying on apps. I'm trying to get more involved in the Muslim community in the chance to meet new people and make friends but have been challenging. I have no trouble meeting men In general but I prefer a Muslim man.	Delicious_Response14	follow-up	na	na	na	0.004322633147239685	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

"That makes more sense. I can somewhat understand your experience as I want to marry a Christian man. It makes it tough because you can’t just tell by looking at someone what their religious preference is lol. 

But, maybe give it more time than a few months. Especially since it’s summer. People are traveling and on vacation. As fall and winter come you’ll likely meet more men as they’re more likely to stay local in the area around that time (I’m not basing that on anything factual but just an assumption). But definitely give yourself some more time, it’s only been a few months. Maybe once you make some solid friendships they can help you meet more people."

"Hi ladies, this is a nerdy question but genuinely curious as to if any of you play sims 4 or sims 3. If so, are you into mods? Also to any simmers I’m currently trying to figure out if I should bother updating my mods folder after four months and many updates to the game or if I should just completely start over with very little mods. My mods folder is literally 95 gb and sims 4 literally runs like shit because of it, I just want to be able to enjoy the game again without a hella long wait I don’t care if I have to totally start over. Sims 3 is pretty much the same shit so I might do the same thing with that one and just totally reset my games.
Edit: thank you all for your lovely responses and advice! I didn’t respond to everyone but I read every post and I’m grateful to have such a active and helpful community :) in the end I decided to start over and it’s been amazing! happy simming ladies!!"

"I grew up on Sims and play both! Would play 2 again if my pc could run it.

I primarily play 4 because 3 is still an old unoptimized game that sometimes crashes on my pc, but my heart is with 3 because it’s much more fun and has so much more to do, and the sims are more fleshed out imo. 4 can still be fun with all my mods tho.

About your mod situation, I’m useless in this area because I just hoard mods 😭. Both my games have over 19 GB cc. I always think “I should redo my messy mods folder”, but I’m someone who does NOT enjoy mod shopping from scratch because I’m impatient asf, so I just let my mods be unless something breaks. And if I DO start over, I get upset when I realize a mod or cc I use isn’t there anymore and I’ll have to hunt for it all over again. If you don’t mind cc and mod shopping, I think starting over won’t be too bad, especially since you can experience playing a smooth game."

i think that instead of starting over, you could just scale down your mod folder for now and only update the ones that you really love or feel are necessary. put the others to the side and update them later or just get rid of them, especially with regard to your computer and game running better. i know you said you don’t mind starting over, but i’d hate to see you lose your progress. either way, let me know what you decide to do. i love chatting with fellow simmers! ❤️"	Throwawayokaylolhah	reply	na	na	na	0.00491617526859045	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

"Yes, and yes. Haven't played since January, but since I'm done with school, I'll probably get back.

Honestly I always fuck up something with mods especially on updates. I stick to about two or three larger mods and then just work with that. Redownload when an update comes. My binges tend to end right before a big update, so that helps at least. 

I'm not big on CC though, maybe I'll try and add some new hairstyles, but I feel like a lot of CC does not go with the aesthetic of the game, so I don't even bother.

I personally have a Testing Mods folder in my documents where if mods are messing up, I'll dump them there and add them back one at a time to see what's broken.

I’ve been a simmer since the original sims came out ages ago. I prefer sims 2 and 3 but like the build mode in sims 4. Every once in a while I go through and clear out any mods that I no longer want or that I think may cause issues. I reinstall the game mods I need because trying to play sims 4 live mode without it is tragic, I just can’t. Honestly haven’t even tried to actually play the game play in over a year I just build things mostly. I don’t use mods for builds unless I have no intention on sharing it in the library/store.

MC Command Center is great, and probably the most popular and well known mod. It adds a ton of content, and the best way to summarize is that it makes controlling things in the game a lot easier and more convenient.

They did less with 4 because it was originally intended to be an online only game. Nobody wanted that and EA decided to spend years creating code for a multiplayer game, only to listen to fans at the last minute and switch it back to single player.

Ladies!!! I’m curious. From your perspectives, what would you consider a “healthy sex life” as a single woman? I am 33yo and have been single for a few years. I have dated a little here and there, but have really taken time to heal from past relationships and trauma, which required a lot of solitude. Now, I am finding myself in a place where I am ready to get back in the dating world (no matter how pissy the dating pool is 😅) and seek romantic companionship. As I get back into the groove of things, I am tempted to have a little intimate fun along the way but not sure if that’s a good idea if I’m ultimately seeking a long term partner. Any advice or tips are appreciated!	Upstairs_Speed2036	post	41.88024989013146	male	White	0.0028356288094073534	na	na	na	14	blackladies
"My perspective of a healthy sex life as a single woman would be to just always practice safe sex and to vet your partner before engaging in sexual activities. (Ex. Sexual heath status, last time they've been tested, relationship expectations, birth control, etc) 

Preferably get tested together. 
Never ever trust their word alone, because they lie or they don't know their status because they foolishly trusted their last partner(s) who lied and relied on their ""results."" 

Must see their test results or get tested together before engaging in sexual activity.

Get tested regularly. 2weeks after having a new partner and every 6months. Request blood tests and full STD panel.  

Do what you feel that you can handle emotionally and spiritually. As long your sexual activity isn't negatively affecting your mental or physical health, it's a healthy sex life.

"Most men suck at sex or don’t care enough to please women, so I don’t recommend a “hoe phase” because it’ll benefit the men more than it’ll ever benefit you. 

I say talk very openly about sex with whatever partner you find suitable before you guys hop in bed. Like, *very* open to the point where there’s no reason why he shouldn’t know what button of yours to press to make sure you’re having an amazing experience. 

If you don’t know how to vocalize your needs confidently, you’re making the sex about the other person and not you. So definitely practice that if you need to or get to know yourself solo first if that’s something you need also."	Upstairs_Speed2036	reply	na	na	na	0.0028356288094073534	no	no	no	na	blackladies
I agree with the health comment, a lot of these men be lying so I wrap it 100% of the time until I’m already in a exclusive relationship sexual or otherwise. From an emotional standpoint I think this is a very personal matter. Are you the type of person who can have casual sex and not be stressed? Then just be safe and comfortable! If you’re like me and you struggle having sex with folks you don’t have a good connection with, then I would say yknow you can of course try a bit but don’t ever force it, make yourself uncomfortable, or accept wack sex.  That’s my lil cents for until you’re ready to go into relationship mode, which I’m glad you’ve taken your time with ☺️💪🏽 good luck!

"Average median rent in the entire U.S. right now is over 2,000/mo. Student loan interest restarts accumulating in September, and payments start in October. I work an extremely exhausting job full time and have two degrees. Two or three years of rent in a one bedroom would be enough to pay off my entire student loans. 

Living at home has several drawbacks mental health wise, but I'm having to consider it financially. I want to be able to move out and live alone comfortably, not with a bunch of other people just to survive.

What are y'all's experiences? Did anyone leave and regret it? Or go back and regret it more? Is it better to do what's financially better or mentally better? Is it even possible to not sacrifice one for the other?

Edit: Thanks to everyone who took the time to read and weigh in! I read every comment even if I didn't reply.

"I didn't move out of my parents' house until I bought my own when I was 29. I was there through college (I agreed to go to a local school in exchange for an extra bedroom and a car); and was there my first handful of working years. 😫

After college, I was going to move in with a friend, but that had fallen through so I decided to suck it up a few years and stay home so I could save the money for a house and only need to count on myself. 

It was definitely hard in terms of the fact that my father and I couldn't stand each other. Also anytime I wanted to see a friend, or god-forbid, a BF, I always had to entertain them at a hotel since my parents were never welcoming to MY people (my brother was a different story. See also: BOY). 

Honestly, my basic coping strategy was to avoid my parents as much as possible. It was easy during the week because I commuted 3 hours, and worked between 12-14 hours a day, so I left before they were up and went straight to my space when I got home. On weekends, they would go see my dad's family, so I would use that time to do laundry, or other things that required me to be out and about in another part of the house. Fortunately, the size and layout of their house made it somewhat easy to get to certain parts without running into someone. Otherwise, I literally stayed in my room when I was there, or I went somewhere else (like spending a weekend at a friend's place).

At the end of the day, it WAS worth the suffering through the extra couple years there. I was able to buy my own house and have never relied on anyone since. It's doable, but just takes a bit of intestinal fortitude! 😅"	firelord_catra	reply	na	na	na	0.003919615875929594	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

I lived at home for a year after college and it was the worst year of my life. Entered into the worst depression I've ever experienced. On one end living at home I saved a decent amount of money and paid no bills and I eventually got a decent paying job that allowed me to move but my depression caused me several health problems I still struggle with today. Though I completely understand the economy is TERRIBLE!!! If my parents didn't suck then I'd 100% would have stayed my ass at home for years. But since they do suck looking back I wish I woulda moved in with friends or relatives, I live well now but I don't think the damage I went through was worth it. But if your parents aren't bad then saving money in these terrible times is the best option IF you're mental health can survive in your parent's house.

It wasn't great but it definitely wasn't miserable and I liked going out with my mom and being able to talk to her all the time. So reading these comments is kind of surprising and sad that so many people had such a miserable experience with their parents.

But for your post specifically, it depends on the dynamics you had with your family. I mean of course they're going to get on you about doing things around the house and might be nosey about what you're doing/where you're going, but if you can deal with that and the environment won't be toxic to you, I say it's worth saving the money."	firelord_catra	reply	na	na	na	0.003919615875929594	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
My parents have always been super supportive & I love them dearly, however I’m in my early 20s & I would love to live on my own while I’m still young and child free. I’m grateful that I have parents that love when I’m home & encourage me to stay until I can afford to live on my own, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t wish I could live alone just to have that time for myself and self development before I get married and start a family.	firelord_catra	reply	na	na	na	0.003919615875929594	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
"I moved out in my mid 20s because my parents' marriage was very hostile, my mom is a clinical narcissist, and I just couldn't be there anymore. Was out for 2 years, parents finally separated, then moved back in with my dad in my late 20s because (1) he was suffering from serious depression (glad to be rid of my mom, but I think having to now publicly admit the ""failed marriage"" part messed him up really bad because he hid it from even his own siblings for decades) and (2) I quit my previous job because it was making me want to unalive myself, so I wouldn't be able to swing another year of rent in my apartment (I live in one of the most expensive counties in the US). 

Being back in the house was really difficult at first, I hated being in my childhood room because of all the abuse that was associated with it. But I finally decided to move to a different room in the house, replace all the furniture, and redecorate -- and that made a HUGE difference, just psychologically. I've also been getting rid of and replacing a lot of my mom's stuff around the house. That helps both me and my dad. 

I think I'm also lucky in that my dad knows this wasn't too much my \*choice\*, it was a force of both of our circumstances, and so he isn't as overbearing as he was when I was growing up -- he knows I didn't want this so he gives me my space. I'm not in a situation where he's trying to undermine my independence, which I know is an issue a lot of adults run into when they live with their parents as adults. 

At the end of the day, I'd say that even though I'm not \*happy\* about it, I don't \*regret\* moving back -- I'm saving a whole lot of money in this mf lmao."	firelord_catra	reply	na	na	na	0.003919615875929594	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

I had to move back due to my health and a chronic illness and it's been the worst decision ever on all but the financial front. My parents have / have always had a toxic relationship and as they've aged both have weaponized their selfishness to where I wasn't even sure I'd survive COVID under their roof. (My father was an Ivermectin person and wasn't careful, despite my being here. And made it a game to try and argue with me - an immunocompromised person - about the science and things like washing your hands when you come in the door.) If you can find a way to rent a room or maybe AirBnB it for a while - or borrow the money to live elsewhere and make payments to the person - I'd recommend it.	firelord_catra	reply	na	na	na	0.003919615875929594	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

"Kind of considering this. My girlfriend and I are going to move back to my hometown of Atlanta after we graduate with our Masters in May. My parents have said that we’re more than welcome to move in with them but we’re not sure if that’s the best decision for us. My parents are great so our hesitation has nothing to do with them. 

We’re renting a 3 bedroom house now for just the two of us and it’s the perfect amount of space. We each have a separate hobby rooms and we don’t want to lose that.

My girlfriend is very anal over her kitchen and runs it like a grocery store or pantry almost. She would lose having full autonomy over her kitchen.

One of us(me) isn’t exactly quiet in the bedroom. I don’t need my parents hearing this girl take my soul from my body.

My parents turned their first house into a rental property but my oldest sister is possibly moving back too and as the oldest she gets first dibs on that house.

"Sis, I think you're putting yourself under unnecessary pressure and stress. The world we live in is not the same as it was just 10 years ago. I don't think there's anywhere in the US that the average single person can actually afford to live comfortably. There's nothing wrong with returning home to set yourself up better financially to reach your goal of having your own place. As others have said, it's not uncommon, and it is usually necessary these days to go back home as an adult. Personally, I think going home is better than staying with unpredictable roommates and potentially being in a dangerous situation.

I love the ideas of giving yourself a goal and also finding outlets for plenty of time away from home life. Additionally, I think reading and implementing some of the practices in Set Boundaries, Find Peace by Nedra Glover Tawwab may be helpful when the situations with your family you've mentioned not wanting to be involved in come up. 

I don't take lightly that this is a difficult decision for you. I'm wishing you the best of luck in whatever you decide. 🫂"	firelord_catra	reply	na	na	na	0.003919615875929594	weak	no	no	na	blackladies
I moved back home after undergrad and lived at home until I was 27. I was able to spend a lot of time with my grandparents before they passed/developed advanced dementia and that made it worth it. Other things that made it worth it: it put me in a great place financially, which allowed me to save money and eventually purchase a property on my own (I did a lease takeover of an apartment first). I was also able to network a lot and take career risks because I didn't have financial concerns, which paid off massively. But it came at the cost of a social/romantic life and happiness, though. My parents live far from where I socialize/date, my home life was loving but dysfunctional at the time, and there were excessive caregiving needs. I was really unhappy and think I would have been further along socially and romantically if I hadn't lived at home as long. I don't regret living at home and I'm happy with where my life is, but I would set a time limit or at least check in with yourself regularly to see how you feel. There's a point of diminishing returns and I recommend not staying past that point. Good luck!	firelord_catra	reply	na	na	na	0.003919615875929594	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

"I have lived with both of my parents at 24
My mom at 28
And moving in with my dad soon at 29.

Luckily they got divorced and living with them wasn’t so bad anymore. At 24 I literally used my offer letter to get an apartment in the hood cause I’d rather have been inside at night due to the threat of a drive by than to be living with both of them under the same room.

I loved living alone, but I also had to follow a crazy strict budget. 2020-2022 I got my friend and ex as roommates. Baby that was the worst decision I’ve ever made in my life. I was very sad cause my mom had told me to buy a house in 2019 and I brushed it off- look at me now.

I changed careers and states and lived with my mom. Was chill.
I’m going back to my old career now and living with my dad. He’s more toxic than my mom but I’m hoping we can miss each other most times.

I will be paying my dad $650/month. Obviously can’t get that anywhere else. Gives me the opportunity to save for the year I’ll be there and I just keep reminding myself that I don’t HAVE to stay. I live in a major city so I can always look for someone renting a room. Knowing it’s not a necessity keeps me from staying if I get miserable. That’s how I’m protecting my mental health.

We live in a major city in the South, and COL is steadily going up. She can't afford a place of her own. I theoretically could, but it wouldn't be the best, and I'd be even more paycheck to paycheck than I already am. 

My mom and I have a decent relationship, no major conflicts or anything. But, I also understand the impact that not having my own complete space is having in my mental health.

Even tho I would never outright say it: I'm kinda glad that we live together just because it means that my mom doesn't have to worry (as much) about money. She grew up poor and we struggled HARD when I was growing up. I was super aware of our money troubles, unfortunately and I was so glad to start working and help her out.

"For me, I moved out for the first time last year in October. I was 23 then now I’m 24. I had been home since the pandemic started after I couldn’t physically attend my college. I was there for three years? It was really hard for me. I lived in NorCal at the time but my life was in SoCal. My boyfriend, who we had to take turn traveling to see each other. My friends and just where I wanted to build my life was in SoCal. I had a hard time being at home cause I shared a room with my younger brother and I had no space. My mom and I clashed often, but parents were letting me stay rent free to save up so I could move. I had a shitty management job but I was able to leave and secure like my real big girl job that was remote and payed very well, that was in my degree (Screenwriting)! So saving was easier since it was more. Eventually I was able to save what I needed and started looking for places. I’m living by myself no roomates in a safe area in Sherman Oaks. I don’t regret it! It’s the best thing I could have done for me and my family cause I don’t think I could survived another minute in that house. 

But I also got a once in a lifetime job opportunity. ( The we’re hiring one person to replace a writer the company had for 3 decades). I’m blessed but I also have a one track mind. Mentally it’s better but I’m navigating different issues like feeling a little lonely and trying to force myself to leave the house cause it’s easy to stay in when you work from home. I have a better relationship with my mom. I think it was worth it. Everything is just expensive now but there are pockets where you could find a good thing that works for you.

It's not that I'm worried about, but more of the mental toll of being the parentified emotional support child for family issues, and everything else that comes with living at home.	firelord_catra	follow-up	na	na	na	0.003919615875929594	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

"Oh no! 😫 First of all, by no means are you a failure.. AT ALL. Cost of living is ridiculous these days, and living with one's parents as an adult is HAAAARD!  

I guess at the end of the day you will have to weigh the pros and cons of living with your folks, versus roommates, considering each would be a temporary situation; maybe even try to set a savings goal and end date. Like, if your folks are really going to grind down your mental health, but maybe a couple roomies would be a little more tolerable, might be worth sharing for a while. Maybe write out a side by side comparison.

"I'm so sorry it's been so tough. I could go on and on about how colleges need to do so much more for alumni and actually integrate job prospects into these dam degrees they make us pay so much money for. Maybe if you could get refunds maybe these colleges would do better

Yeah roommates are always such a mixed bag😩 It can go great or terrible. And it's hard finding people to depend on. And yeah a friend who just got married whether he realizes or not really will need a solo space for him and his partner especially for the first year. I'd tries to set up a backup roommate plan with some else JUST in case. Sometimes just knowing you have the option to be elsewhere can make you mentally feel so much better

That's great you have a support system in the area! My biggest issue when I moved back home was that I had none😩 all my friends were hours away and they were near impossible to visit during the pandemic. I'd suggest from being similar situation is to have other places to be at besides home. Have a part time job or hobby/club, I did door dash but I wish I worked part time somewhere cuz even though retail is terrible I desperately needed consistent interaction with people outside of my parents and a routine.  I'd also have someone who is kewl with me coming over often and staying over occasionally. I'd also have a place to study/apply for jobs, like a Starbucks or the library. I think all those places to be would have really helped me.

And most of all, Don't loose hope, always repeat to yourself ""THIS IS TEMPORARY"". I have friends in toxic homes and some of them just lost hope after not being able to move out or find a job and now they kinda accepted the misery and let it kill their motivation and aspirations. It's so sad to watch and I pray everyday they get outta the funk soon. 

Now about the therapy, you can actually get free therapy through your state's mental health site. The therapy is through psychology schools in the area and the therapist is a therapist in training hence why it's free. Though your sessions would be privy to research I believe, I did it myself but it's been so long that I can't remember the specifics I think maybe you can choose if it's used or how🤔 Anyway something else you can do is call therapists and specifically ask if they have ""sliding scale rates"" which is different rates for people in bad financial situations. My first non pro bono therapist gave me the rate of $40 per appointment when her regular rate was $140. God bless her she saved me. At the time I had 50k salary yet STILL couldn't afford therapy, my job insurance at the time covered nothing in terms of mental health and a lot of my money went into dealing with the other health problems I gained from my depression. So $400+ a month for therapy was not possible at the time.

"Thank you. 🌼

I did catch COVID - during the pre-mask, early days of the virus - and unwittingly gave it to my 70-something mother which was traumatic AF just on its own. (Luckily she's ok.) Didn't realize that was what it we'd had for almost a year. Put on like 30 lbs I'd *just* taken off that fall / winter from the fear, stress of it all. Just totally wrecked my body, shook my spirit. And the lack of parental compassion and consideration was just *mind*\-*blowing* and unexpected, FRFR. I am so so sorry you had to experience it too. 

Hey, have you online searched ""housesitters/housesitter jobs""? Full disclosure: I haven't tried one. Have just always wanted to try something like that - especially when I was younger - and never followed through.

This is definitely fair! As is your point about roommates. I was very fortunate in that respect. 


But I really want you to weigh the true cost of your mental health in both situations and find which is easier to navigate. 

 Maybe if stay with family, pick up an outside hobby so you don't have to be home much. Doesn't have to cost any money either - sitting in the library to read, people watching in the park. That's what I did - I worked as much as I could or would go shopping (not splurging or anything.

I still remember them saying, ""Everyone gets offered that starting out, even if you have a masters."" It does mean you have to fight for anything over 13. And if you find a job paying $16-20, you suffer through it even if it's terrible because it's so hard to come by.

Ofc this somewhat is based on what you major in, but I have a lot of friends in this boat who were in different fields. Also, with inflation, nowhere in the nation is 7.25 liveable.

So I’m basically my only provider financially and thankfully I live with my mother so I don’t have to pay rent or anything like that but as I’m now looking for my own car adulthood is really just gave me a good slap in the face as I’m researching. I think for most gen-z black children can relate to that in most situations our parents don’t prepare us for anything like this. For reference, I have little to no help from my parents not only bc they’re divorced and have a shitty relationship with one another  (lowkey was fed to sharks in this adult world) but also suffering in this shitty economy (the shitty U.S btw). Thankfully on my part I worked hard to make $18/hr to work at this front desk security job that also pays me weekly (while being a student) I even got close with my supervisor to help me gain more hrs with the extra shifts I work so I’ve been working and saving tremendously. I’ve also been considering since I commute to work and school (Public transportation/Uber/Lyft) to start looking for my own car to have my transportation but man …. Why is everything so goddamn EXPENSIVE?!?! Car insurance, registration, getting a used & reliable car itself so taxing … I can only imagine how the economy would be like in the next 2-3 yrs… would it get worse? Would it get better? Who even knows. My parents are immigrants btw so I’m learned a lot on my own but I wish this was all taught in schools bc nobody deserves to find all this bullshit out after working so hard to get their own transportation which is now considered a luxury nowadays.

"That must be really hard. You didn't mention your specific age, but either way, have you considered college? I know not everyone wants to risk going into debt and may feel like they don't even have the resources to prioritize applying, but I would strongly recommend it. You can start in community college and then focus hard on getting a bachelor's. Either that or getting into a trade and pursuing that schooling as well. Having a college degree is probably one the most predictable, singular factors that can reliably open doors for better income and benefits. Further education beyond that is even better in terms of potential income usually, depending on the career field. You may qualify for scholarships. Even if you don't, it could be a good idea. Having said that, some people carry student loan debt that affects their lives. But the impact isn't the same. My friend who comes from a well off family took on all of her student debt and went to law school to become a big law lawyer. She has a ton of debt that she's paying off quickly now, but she also makes more money than most people will ever make. That would have been very unlikely without education. Most of us don't make that kind of money but many of us are still comfortable. I work in nonprofit development, and I'm comfortable, but not at goal salary yet. I also live in NYC where rent is expensive, but I don't need to own a car. (I do take too many Ubers though...) A college education is required for most jobs in my specific line of work, and my education definitely provided me with the skills and further knowledge that help me in my career. My bf makes a lot more, as he's in tech as a senior data engineer, and he had to have an education as well.

If not academic education, again, getting into a trade / vocational school would be good. It's just really hard without that. The western world just isn't set up for success for people who don't pursue education or credentials of some kind. The only other thing I can think of is maybe getting into maintenance, custodial care of buildings (aka janitors), or security and I think some training or certification may also be helpful in getting the most pay in those roles as well. But the city hires those roles as well and you may be able to find something with government benefits perhaps, bot 100% sure but it's worth a shot. Then again, I don't know what they pay. 

Full disclaimer, I didn't struggle this way so I totally had a silver spoon in my mouth. I was voluntarily poor in my mid-20s because I did the Americorps VISTA program (like domestic version of the Peace Corps) to start my career at 25ish. I lived at home those two years after college but I went to school out of state at 18 and probably still would have if my parents didn't pay for school - this is what most of my friends did to some extent. Several years later, now I make 75k and I just got a job offer for 85k. Still not at my goal salary of over 100k but I'll get there in a few years. I'm 33 now. Some get here way faster depending on industry. Study something in STEM, especially engineering, and you may start out after college close to or at/above what I make now. But that's with a degree. My bf makes like 400k but that's another story and again, he's in tech and has an entrepreneur background. So things can get better - if you plan for them and put the wheels in motion. I also have classmates who didn't go to college and had kids on their minimum wage or slightly over that income. I'm sure they're happy with their children, whereas I'm 33 and chose not to have kids young so that I could focus on growing up and making more money to give my kids a good life. Neither is better objectively but the former will make life harder.

You could try joining a coding bootcamp and becomingba software developer, but idk if having a degree is barrier or not - it may be. That's a way to significantly increase income, but idk what their qualifications are. 

When you're young, it is really hard without student loans and education. Even after that, some fields want you to do unpaid or low income internships. If you can do the ""student loans for education and be serious about it while attending school in a large city where you don't need a car and can spend all your money on rent / food and use student loans to support your living expenses while focusing on a track to a higher paying career after graduation,"" then I'd recommend that. Debt is risky, ofc, but I think not having a degree, and especially the networks of professors, counselors, connectors, and opportunities that comes with education, is probably a greater risk. 

And yes, costs of living and real estate everywhere are getting more expensive. Choose your path wisely - that's the best thing to do while you're young.

Edit : You could also try the e-commerce or influencer routes. It's a long haul and slow burn to success, but people have done it! You still need access to some resources. One of our libraries has a free recording studio with equipment. Maybe see if any public libraries or nonprofits near you have things like that, if you're interested.

Also lots of nonprofits exist to help young people with jobs and personal development. I'd search for resources in your area."	bbysitva	reply	na	na	na	0.9987894892692566	weak	no	strong	na	blackladies
"You sound a lot like a friend of mine. She felt like she was thrown to the wolves as far as adulthood including college, picking a career, taxes, financially planning, relationships, all of it. Her parents just expected her to figure it out, and then we're disappointed when she didn't. She just moved out at 28 with friends of hers and she's taking it one step at a time. 

I'm in a similar boat. My parents are a bit more involved but in the sense that they are ""doctor lawyer engineer or failure"" type of immigrant parents. I'm now doing a career I hate and trying to find a way to make the degree I suffered for work for me. But as far as finances and being financially stable and aware, heck no. I do have less loans than my brother as I was savvy enough to pick a cheaper school with more scholarship opportunities. But it's the having my own place, paying back loans and CC debt, and building a career that I don't hate part of life I'm struggling with. Their solution to everything is to live at home as long as possible; which is financially feasible but not the best mental health wise. 

Honestly, our parents are figuring shit out for the first time too. Especially being immigrants. Raising a kid in another country where the culture might be counter to your own is a feat in and of itself. Add in pandemic, inflation and all the other crap going on right now and it's even more of a clusterfuck. Even Americans (assuming you're in the U.S. apologies if not) who have been here are struggling rn. Even if they try there's only so much they can prepare us for you know?

I agree schools could do a better job though. Especially when it comes to college prep, loans, taxes etc. True highschoolers barely paid attention anyways but I was beat over the head with the Pythagorean theory and told I wouldn't succeed in life for failing geometry and chemistry, yet the actual important things to living live here were not taught at all. Not to mention community college being treated like the 13th grade, but it saved me an entire years worth of college loans.

It's a lot to figure out, I agree. It feels very sink or swim especially these days. I guess advice would be try to do one thing at a time and realize you can't solve everything at once. And you may not have all the most luxury items--my first car was old enough to be my younger brother, but it got me through my last semester of college and starting my job. I hated living at home and my call center job, but I was able to save enough doing that to pay off a private student loan and buy a decent car right at the beginning of the ""car shortage."" 

Another thing would be not to compare yourself to others. I have a coworker younger than me who seems to have it all figured out. Talking to her and found out both of her degrees and her apartment was completely paid for by her parents. They also supported her mental health and helped her get into therapy from a young age. I didn't have any of that; so I can't compare my journey and life to hers otherwise I'll feel like shit."	bbysitva	reply	na	na	na	0.9987894892692566	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

Also wanted to say that my dad is pretty comfortable and doesn't have a bachelor's. He has an associate's degree and basically worked his way up to manager in the restaurant industry and became a top manager the company asked to go out to other restaurants in the company to help them improve outcomes. He used that management to get an even better paying position in management in another industry after that, now manages a department in a hospital. But he's a boomer and this happened a long time ago when I was pretty young. He's still working there though and their benefits paid for half my college tuition. So it's possible, but he hasn't been promoted to the next level because he doesn't have a degree.

I’m doing a 2 year at community college bc university was way too expensive for me coming from a poor household but after I get my associates I am going to transfer to a university to get my bachelors! I didn’t want want to do the traditional 4 yr bc I had way too much on my plate and I didn’t want to risk putting myself in debt while also trying to get my certifications in the tech field AND pursue my degree. I want to do things the smart way where I’m not putting my mental health in jeopardy bc I cherish that so much. I’m using this job ofc towards my advantage bc it has a LOT to deal with the tech field and project management. My dream is to do project management or software development :) Im still trying to network and stuff like that but it can get challenging but nothing I’m uncomfortable with. Thank you for the input though I very much appreciate it	bbysitva	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9987894892692566	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
"TW: I ’ve noticed that right before my period starts, I get borderline suicidal. Like no interest in anything, just sad, always wants to sleep, no energy and no interest in life and just want to hurt myself so I can “feel” something.

I’ve tried to combat this by drinking wine which seems to help in the moment but makes me feel worse the next day. Not sure if this is just my depression or if women experience something similar to this? Any coping mechanisms that works?"

This is a medical condition you should see your doctor about it. It’s normal to have some mood swings but you shouldn’t be that miserable. That’s not healthy. A friend of mine had a similar experience and the doctor told her she had hormonal issues and I think put her on medication to mitigate that. If you’re not interested in that at the very least don’t use alcohol to cope. I think that could be a slippery slope. You’re period isn’t going anywhere for awhile.

"This sounds so similar to PMDD. 
Have you looked into it?
I recommend getting a doctor visit just to make sure it's not something else, or related to hormones- which could also be highly likely.
In some cases people try medication to ease the symptoms.

I also feel extremely depressed and suicidal before my cycle starts and I do have PMDD and had issues with hormonal imbalance. 
I use magnesium, ashwaghanda,  valerian root, an assortment of herbal teas like chamomile, cranberry...and aromatherapy to help me. Grounding incense and candles like sandalwood, lavender, rosemary, sage, uplifting scents such as lemon, orange.  
I also have a therapist.

"It sounds like you have PMDD, but I think it depends on how long your symptoms last. Mine starts about 10 days before my period. Make sure to get your Vit D levels checked as this is a common problem for black people and will make symptoms worse. 

This last cycle was the BEST I’ve ever had. I only had two days of feeling depressed and dead inside, here’s the current regimen I’m on: 

No alcohol or caffeine post ovulation, even a sip makes the symptoms worse for me. 

**Supplements**: Magnesium, Calcium, Potassium, Omega 3, Vit B6

**Prescribed Meds**: Vit D2 weekly 

**Self Care**: Because my cycle is trackable I make the last day of ovulation my “pmdd prep day”, I make sure I have all of the groceries I need, snacks, bills paid, cancel plans I feel like I won’t have the energy for, and clean EVERYTHING. I think of it as nesting like pregnant people do because I know I won’t have the spoons to handle it for the next 10 days.

I think it’s my uterus just being disappointed that we’re going on another month with no baby and I’m feeling frustration for her. I take it as a good sign like maybe our bodies are flushing out all of the bad when we have a period. I’m actually studying menstrual cycles, the moon, our mood shifts.

*7-14 days a month, I turn into a fuckin werewolf.*

*My sex drive is in over drive and its gotten me into dangerous situations, needy for physical touch like being held, I'm suicidal even though I don't want to die, I'm quickly angered, I'm sensitive, I'm violent feel like crying for no reason, I'm irritable, I go picking fights, and I tend to end relationships just 3 days before I bleed.*

*They thought it was Bipolar at first, but no, it was actually a male doctor who noticed something was unusual going on with my period, but so many get defensive when someone suggests it really is their period making them miserable or moody.*

*I used to cope with it by drinking a lot or partaking in risky behavior. I just didn't know what was wrong.*

*One of the few things that help is talking to my recently acquired psychologist, taking edible gummies called ""Rocket Gummies"" ( I swear to you all, these gummies save my life during the time of the month) listening to music, incenses or maybe a small spell, and being left alone during this time to maybe the Sims 3 hours into the next day.*

"In 2020 I feel I had an awakening to misogyny in the world. Like how normalized it is and ever since then I feel I’ve become an “angry feminist” and if I’m being completely honest I’ve started looking at men as a whole differently and have disliked them since.

From the way they talk about women’s bodies, to the harassment, catcalling, they’re casual misogyny in everyday conversations, it has really changed how I feel about them. And I can’t seem to escape this, in 2021 I thought I only disliked men cause I spent too much time on the internet but even when I spent MONTHS off social media I still was around the misogyny. I’ve even experienced this from guys I know and even my own father who I generally consider to be a good person has made misogynistic comments. 

I’ve experienced sexualization from grown men to boys my age since I’ve been in middle school and I’m really over it. From talking about my ass to trying to intimidate me into going on a date with them to random grown men calling me attractive when I was a minor. And as someone who has been deemed not good looking ing and then became good looking it, also seems men seem to hate both women they do and don’t find attractive which I don’t even understand and tbh I’m done trying. 

Roe V. Wade being overturned in the U.S was my breaking point. It just seems men (and a sizable amount of white women) want to control women’s bodies. Our bodies shouldn’t even be involved in politics in the first place. Just in general how women are treated all around the world upsets me. I hate how femicide isn’t considered a hate crime. I hate how domestic violence/SA against women isn’t taken seriously. 

And it’s not just men who I’ve had a problem with it’s how many women also have internalized misogyny. It’s really baffling like how do you hate women when you are one? It’s also really interesting how men express their disdain for women freely and other men say nothing but if one random woman says she doesn’t like men she gets told not to say that by other women?

I feel like I’m too young to have such negative feelings about men (I’m 18) but I just can’t with them anymore. Makes me not even wanna date guys my age. Anyways rant over but I just needed to get that off my chest."	Queen_A123	post	29.181365074278503	female	White	0.9670183062553406	na	na	na	1	blackladies
"i agree with everything you said. though i don’t aim to call myself a feminist since the feminism movement was never really including black women. white women were fighting for their rights while black women were still expected to clean their houses and take care of the kids they popped out. 

i know it’s a tad different now i just think of the founders of feminism and how racist and stereotypical they were towards black women and haven’t attached that title to myself. black feminist maybe, just feminist? not for me. 

white women were like 60 something percent of abortions the year before roe v wade was actually overturned so that law being passed we weren’t even the main people they wanted to take those rights from either. they want more white babies and white women were not having them. 

internalized misogyny is so sad. being a female security guard i hear all the time that this job is for a man, why am i doing this, blah blah blah. those women don’t believe in themselves to why would i expect them to believe in me yk? but i think it’s constant years of that being beat into their head that men are superior BLAH BLAH BLAH."

Just like others have commented I think it depends on how serious the relationship was with the ex. Flings and friends with benefits don’t have the same leverage as a serious relationship. Funny enough my friend and I both had a “fling”  with the same guy, her fling was a year or two after mine. We are very close and it didn’t bother me because I wasn’t dating the guy. It was just a simple D appointment when needed. That really meant nothing just having fun. However it would feel shady if it was someone I was with for a long time and my friend actively seen me with. It’s subjective. Depending on who you talk to, even a friends with benefits situation with the same person could ruin a friendship. And if that’s someone else’s deal breaker that is okay. But code is rather important to me, but only depending on how emotionally important that person was to me or my friend. If I knew they dated for a long time and how much that person meant to them at a prior time in their life, I would never.

She was with him for probably less than 6 months and I was pregnant by my oldest sons father during their relationship. Since she used to always bring me along to hang out with them to “get me out the house” we eventually became friends.  After they broke up I saw him at the store once after I had my son and was like “oh you gotta swing by and see the baby” since he was damn near part of the pregnancy too lol. One time turned into him coming by to hang out with us every once in a while. Before anything ever happened between us I asked her if she was cool with us hanging like that and she very enthusiastically told me she was fine with it. So we evolved from there were married for 12 years and had two kids of our own. 


Now had they been in a serious relationship or had she told me no? Absolutely not I wouldn’t have even thought about it. And we were 17-19 so young as hell.  Would I do it at this age? More than likely not because at this age we been in serious relationships and had a couple kids and that just seems like it would be awkward as hell.  But the situation with me and my ex-husband was more or less a weirdly perfect storm."	ChrissyChrissyPie	reply	na	na	na	0.0025717252865433693	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

I agree! I’ve always felt this way. If my people are happy and in love I don’t care. If I’m not with them- it’s because for some reason I’ve decided that I don’t want them. I’m not gonna be negative Nancy and bitter hating on the fact that these two people are now dating each other. But I think the amount you care shows how much you’re not actually over the other person. B/c ultimately if you don’t want them like that- why should you care?

"Honestly, I believe that I'm monogamous but find ethical non monogamy interesting because I believe there's a lot that can be learned from it. Navigating jealousy in a healthy way is one, because ENM ppl def get jealous, but they're forced to learn how to deal with it in ways that allow their relationship(s) to move forward. And the differing opinions I see here remind me heavily of the differences between monogamy and ethical non monogamy. I don't think anyone is here is weird for the way they feel about this—ppl are just wired differently.

That said, I def wouldn't be okay with a friend dating an ex of mine. An ex friend did and I did my best to move past it because the friendship mattered more to me. Ironically, our friendship ultimately ended because it turned out that she'd been heavily jealous the whole time I was with him and got real nasty about it after the fact so I dropped her."

I get pretty weirded out when one of my friends starts copying me too much, in any way. If they copy my clothing or jewelry, it sometimes goes too far. If they go around parroting things I say, it can be too much. And then if they try to date one of my exes, it’s like the ultimate pushing me aside and trying to take over my life.

I had a friend who asked if I minded her asking my ex out. I said no, I didn't mind, as I genuinely didn't have a problem with it. She knew he was a dickhead who'd treated me badly, so she knew what she was getting into. Unfortunately she dropped me as a friend. I suspect he got to her about it, but I also think maybe she felt awkward about being with him and being my friend as well.

Sometimes, a lot of women will be in a relationship with someone not due to careful thought of combatibility but for social status or to just mess around. And in the end, they’re dating someone else’s husband or life partner.

I get feeling weird about it but I think a lot of women need to become more emotionally mature when it comes to men and dating.

I don’t know what type of friends you have. But my friends and I don’t date people who are the reason for our friends crying or are not in a relationship with them anymore. Amicable break up or not. 


Also, I’m bisexual so I don’t know where that last paragraph came from. And trust me there is a lot of immaturity in the queer community when it comes to dating.

"As someone that goes to college in Korea, I feel like I personally would be better off focusing on making friends than dating. I grew up here, I love to travel here and I love Korean food so I don’t mind. I would like to date and don’t get me wrong I think I am beautiful and I am confident. I’m also 100% okay being alone with myself. But I have friends that say “you should look for a boyfriend” and “when you get a boyfriend we can go on double dates” (they’re Korean) and I’m thinking… I’m not sure how realistic that is here. I don’t care about race when it comes to dating so I can wait to date when I subtle down somewhere else too but I do get curious about the possibility and it just doesn’t seem there. Maybe I’m too much in a rush or overthinking but I’m going into my 2nd year now and I haven’t had any sort of romance, except strange encounters. 

I don’t know if my friends are trying to be nice but I tell them there are majority Korean guys at our school and I’m not sure how many are looking at me as their type. Again I am very confident with myself but I’m being realistic and I also don’t mind that they prefer dating other Korean girls I mean that’s so normal. I’m also aware that there are definitely some guys here that don’t care. I did once reach out to a guy from some of my classes for just friendship (I thought we would get along well and asked out of curiosity) and I was rejected(?) I think? I don’t know what happened to be honest it was a strange dismissal response and he is fluent in English so I just took it as a no lol. 

Anyways I guess I’m just looking for advice on what I could do in my free time instead, if you think it’s a waste of time or not, or experiences from people who have been in my position or similar thanks!"

I’ve heard that dating culture is very intense in Korea. That they view single people as weird/abnormal in a way. I’d guess that’s why your friends are suggesting you get a boyfriend.	TitleRoutine2556	reply	na	na	na	0.9878664016723633	no	no	no	na	blackladies
"OP are you half Korean by chance? That may affect things in your favor or not. Either way, simply growing up there, you’d have an intimate knowledge of the cultural views. 

I don’t know much about East Asia (physically) & Korea specifically, but I do know that area of the World prioritizes Pale/Whiter skin. From (Full Native) Korean Women even complaining / acknowledging how brutal their beauty system is for them. Imagine raising (darker skin/biracial)child in that environment. 

One vlogger I watched, she said (S.) Korea is a country that rapidly developed in 50-70 years with the injection of Western money/investors (primarily USA) to prop them up. However, economic/infrastructure rapid development in such a short time doesn’t translate to shedding old (prejudiced/biased per American standards) views. USA/West despite it numerous flaws & complaints is at least aware it can be “diverse”. S. Korea is still largely uncomfortable/unfamiliar with this, despite what the current media portrayal of Kpop is showing. Hence why I never cared for it, they aren’t my people & I don’t expect anything from them & support my own celebration via Afrobeats as a Nigerian. 

In addition, there is more familial pressure to date/marry intra-culturally. S. Korea native population is on a serious decline. In an already entrenched conservative culture, the gov is incentivizing native citizens to get with each other. Imagine the cultural ramifications of dating/marring out? Also, pressures from an economy pigeon-holed & hinged on primarily tech (i.e. Car & software industry), S.Koreans are facing an undercurrent of an economic recession (from what I’ve read, correct me if I’m wrong) coupled with N. Korea’s military threats. These Men are required to serve in the Military, imagine the Nationalistic propaganda they’re fed as well. All these pressures can influence a S. Korean Man’s views on dating seriously (if it’s what you desire). Typically from what I see, those who do date foreigners (&seriously) grew up or had some outside influence aside from S. Korea, with preference for Women with closer proximity to Paler skin/features.

 I say all this to say, your dating efforts may not be in your control, especially in East Asia. Don’t beat yourself up if things aren’t working out. Seek out activities & environments you feel physically/mentally safe & comfortable until your next move. If you do find romance/love, I only want the best for you, & wish you much happiness 💜.

Girl please stay away they are CRAZY. I dated a Korean man from korea in my early college days. He was a foreign exchange student. He basically stalked me and tracked everywhere I was all the time and if I didn’t call him or text him like every five seconds, he would get upset. From talking to my korean friends, I know that over communication, lack of boundaries and personal space is a major thing in korean relationships. Oddly enough, years later, after dating men of other races, I ended up marrying a korean American who also said that’s the reason why he doesn’t date in his race because relationships are very heavy and it’s not his thing because two individuals don’t exist. You have to be ONE with everything.	TitleRoutine2556	reply	na	na	na	0.9878664016723633	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

"I’m 30 btw and this is now the 2nd coffee date I’ve been asked on for a first date and I always feel like it’s pretty low effort. I don’t mind a chill first date to chop it up like a picnic and walking around, but even then, they bring a bottle of wine (no opener or cups) and I’m usually the one to bring blankets, snacks etc. because they never think that far.

I like to DO things where we can be active, have fun or give me a reason to dress cute for dinner.

Curious for y’all thoughts?

Edit to add: these are dates from dating apps so it would be a first time meet up. I also don’t mind paying for myself as non traditional as it sounds. I also don’t drink coffee 😅

2nd edit: I was NOT expecting all these opinions 😂, but thanks for the alternate POVs. Ultimately, I suggested smoothies as an alt, and turns out they don’t drink coffee either (yea I know), so it’s a go + we’re going to the free comedy show I initially suggested so even though I basically planned the date, it’s a win since I’m happy lol.

I'm engaged now and our first date was at a bar. That's pretty much the same thing as a coffee date. It was more comfortable for both of us because neither wanted to be stuck with a big (or even medium) bill for a bad time. I think it's a lot to expect a stranger to buy you dinner.

"Personally, I’m not a fan of coffee dates. I did when I was younger, but at my 29 years old self, no. I make exceptions if the coffee date is the beginning of the date and there is more planned. 

I like a lunch or dinner date as a first date. But then again, I like dressing up. I like seeing the best version of the person I’m talking to. I like trying new restaurants. And if a $30 entree (separate checks) is going to break either of our banks, maybe we shouldn’t be going out. I’m okay with someone telling me their finances aren’t in order due to hardships. If they offer to reschedule another time, I willingly pay our tabs. I respect a person who is honest, communicates and attempts to find a solution when things can’t pan out right now. 

I have no problem “investing” in a dinner date. If it doesn’t go well, I pivot. I’m dressed up? I’ll take cute pics to add to my social media or dating apps. I tried new food, had a new experience and a story to tell. Will I be crushed? Probably but I try to get some positives out of it. 

I’m not shy in regards to up and leaving a date that goes south. I’ve built up my confidence and spent too much time in therapy to sit in uncomfortably for the sake of a date. Once it becomes apparent the date misrepresented themselves or wants to waste my time disrespecting me, I’m out. I pay my bill and leave. 

I had an former failed talking stage misrepresent himself. He wasn’t using current photos and was hoping I’d stay for the whole date to not embarrass him. Like I was locked into some social obligation? I just left. The fuck?

Nope. I know that a person with that little conscientiousness, creativity, or effort is never going to be a right fit for me. That said, I know that people come at dates from different expectations or experiences. So when they initially offer something that I don’t find pleasing I give them feedback about whether that’s something that works for me or not, and if not tell them more of what I would like. If they balk, that’s the answer. If they adjust in a way that pleases me, I proceed. Then however the date actually turns out is however it does but at the least I maintain my own integrity by only spending my time and effort with someone who was happy to strive to meet my baseline wants and needs.

"I think coffee dates are great. Better if they're at cool coffee shops or we can tack on more things like a walk though a park, looking at different shops, etc.

But I get the want for a change of pace for a first date. I think a lot of date ideas could use some freshening up honestly.

Maybe offer alternatives to a first date if you're using a dating profile? Like ""picnic in the park, bike rides to our favorite city spots, etc.""?"	Kicylin	reply	na	na	na	0.9976128339767456	no	no	no	na	blackladies
"A cute coffee shop? I'm all for it. If we met via a dating app and have talked for a bit I feel a simple date like coffee, or ice cream or whatever is great to see if there is any chemistry in person. There's not a lot of pressure. If the date goes well and the coffee shop is in an area where there are other activities maybe you can extend the date, and if there are no ""vibes"" then it can be short enough you're not wasting any time. 

Now a Starbucks date ehhhh I feel like that's low effort, the date can be simple but try and make it special or thoughtful.

Coffee is an excellent date because it can always go longer. It's a controlled environment and there are people around.

I love a good low key coffee date. Like others have said it’s more “low stakes” than low effort and gave me a chance to see if the app chemistry translated to real life chemistry. They’re like pre-dates. That way I don’t waste hair and outfits on an awkward 2 hour dinner I wish I could have dipped out on an hour and 45 minutes ago.

"meeting at starbucks or dunkin is different than sitting in a fancy modern cafe with $8 lattes and $12 pastries..just saying. I’d love that as a date. 

I don’t really internet date but The first meet should really just be that. A meeting. Something to drink, AM or PM. 

It’s big weird to me to go on a full dinner date with a stranger but that’s just me. 

Also, if you’re also paying..how is it low effort?? You aren’t being treated here so you have as much say in the activity as the other person does.

"Some of the replies here are amusing. When I was 19/20 and on the apps I was very much dating for fun and dating for dinner (shallow, but true), and doing it in nyc as a college student. 

At 33 I’m not doing that anymore, and while I prefer drinks - coffee dates aren’t offensive. Drinks/coffee for first date with a stranger is fine - it allows the freedom to extend a date or end it early. While no one is obligated to sit through a dinner, it’s far more time consuming and likely that people will, especially once orders have been placed.

Activities are fun, but don’t always make for the best way to get to know a stranger, and again, may suck in more time if you’re not feeling it. The comments about not being to dress up for coffee are what amuses me most - but perhaps that’s a regional thing? Sure, if I’m doing my personal morning trip to a coffee shop I’m in leggings and a T-shirt. But if it’s a coffee date, you can dress cute for that. It’s a matter of choice."

I’ve never liked coffee so never really had a genuine coffee date. But I have done the meet me at whatever spot and let’s walk & talk which never really lead anywhere. I dated a European and they were quite frank about dinner. They said coffee/walking dates are not very adult. Grown people should be going out and getting to know each other over a long meal. They don’t do Dutch. They don’t do TGIF. But they want a decent place, a reserved table and to show you their etiquette and tastes. It’s appropriate. If you don’t click oh well you had a nice meal and a bit of conversation. But getting dolled up for a coffee or a walk is just immature. Haggling over where to go or who pays is also a red flag. If is a man is a man and he wants to date you he will. And you can say this directly to see his response and if they really want to move forward they will do whatever you prefer. The green flag is not having to say it in the first place! Just a simple I like you, let’s meet, dinner at … I’ll meet you there, let’s have a meal from him is really the best opener.

"If it my first in person encounter after meeting on a dating app, then I’m open to going to a smoothie place and chillin or grabbing the smoothie and heading to the park or beach or something else nearby. It’s a time to get to know each other, see if it’s worth investing time into. See if the vibe is good. 

After the “meet and greet” I definitely expect a fun/cute first date. Dinner and a movie, a fun active activity, a tasting and tour, sip and paint, etc. I love when I tell a guy what I’m into and they plan it! It’s so nice! 

I have had guys take me on a very nice date for our first encounter. Those are great. But the downside is if the vibe is off and you wanna hurry and leave but you still waiting on dinner and dessert. That’s why I like the meet and greets first. I’m the type to stick it out then just ghost the guy. But it sucks having time wasted when my time is so valuable. 

When I met my husband it was supposed to be a meet and greet (my idea) but he wanted a real first date. I really enjoyed myself. Was so relieved that I didn’t have to fake an excuse to leave 🤣 Best first date. So it really depends.

If we’re not going the traditional drinks/dinner/movie route (movie’s actually not a great date unless there’s something else planned for after), I’d rather do a picnic (off his planning), museum, farmers market, fest—all free/cheap but at least there’s some substance and variety to it.

"I’ve been on a few dates where I just wanted it to end. These dates were costly to the men that I was dating and also made me feel like I was obligated to stay. Most of these dates were dinner and mini golfing or catered picnics and stuff like that so it would be awkward if right in the middle I wanted to leave.

As I got older I preferred to do the coffee/cafe date, walk in the park with some wine, skipping dinner and just going for desert or having a drink or two. What’s great about dating like that is if you’re having a good time you can always extend it.

Imo I don’t look at those dates as being low effort, going to a fancy restaurant or whatever doesn’t constitute to a high effort activity considering that most of the time all that person is doing is booking a reservation. Meeting up for coffee or tea is a great way to sus out whether that person and you vibe well. However if they only want to do “low effort” things then I’d say that’s a red flag."

I think there’s a notion in this thread going on talking through a spectrum of cheap/free dates to large amounts of money, and dates can definitely be in the middle ground.

"To me, a coffee date as a pre-screening to the real dating. I just want us to come normal, and talk without any distractions in broad daylight. I want to feel them out and make sure they aren’t weird. That only applies to internet strangers though. I’ve had some super shitty first dates with randos that insisted on a nice dinner.

That works for me, but I understand if it doesn’t work for others. There was a Twitter thread last month about if ice cream is too low-effort last month. Everyone sees things differently.

"I think you're missing the forest for the trees. My point isn't that there are only two options for early dating. My point is that you may be missing out on a potential partner because you've decided that low stakes dates are too low effort and beneath you. 

From my own experience, low stakes dates allow you to be flexible. If you go for coffee/drinks/whatever is in that same category and things go well, you can easily extend the date and keep spending time together. If you go for something that takes more planning and a time commitment, you may be stuck with someone you don't really want to spend time with; it's harder to end the date when you choose to do something less casual with a stranger. 

But anyone can do whatever they want! I'm just using easy examples to explain my own perspective and experiences. As I said earlier, I'm engaged and it began with a low stakes date. If I had decided that I wasn't willing to go out with him unless he was willing to buy me, a complete stranger, dinner or whatever else that costs more time and money, I may have missed out on a great partner."

"I always insisted on going dutch on first dates, but was wary of getting stuck at a whole dinner with someone I wasn't really vibing with. Coffee and bar dates are much easier to get out of quickly.  

Going to a bar can give those vibes for sure, but usually it was me who suggested bars lol drinks do cost more than coffee, even at a dive, but its more the low stakes part that I was interested in. I just prefer a glass of wine to coffee (or I did at the time).

Regardless of your preferences, I still think low stakes early dating doesn't indicate how much a guy is willing to put in in general. If he's feeling you, the early date types don't really matter in my experience."	Kicylin	reply	na	na	na	0.9976128339767456	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

"Mmm, that makes sense. It's very personal and subjective! I don't see any one type of date as ""better"" than the other (except when men are just like ""let's walk""), just what works best for people.

I saw that thread. Ice cream would never be my first choice, but I'd prefer that to sitting across from someone drinking tea in broad daylight... I personally just can't hack it haha, I feel very awkward! 

These days I do a lot of vetting before I meet the guy (chats, phone calls, and sometimes even a video call) and that has helped tremendously.

For me it's less about not being able to spend time with someone and more about the fact that some red flags are easy to spot in the first 15min. A coffee date gives you the flexibility to hang around longer if the conversation is good or gtfo if you need to. Then after that first vetting session I bring out the higher quality dates.

Nobody’s against spending time with someone you *like*, but idk if I like someone before I met them. If I realize within the first 20 minutes that he’s just not for me, a casual coffee date gives you an easy out that a more planned date doesn’t. Like, the idea of being stuck at a picnic with a guy I never met before who reveals within 15 minutes that he was a Kevin Samuels stan or believes the world is run by lizard people makes my skin crawl. On the flip side, if I do decide I like the guy, we can extend the coffee date or take it somewhere else. It’s more flexible in a world where so many dates are entered pretty blindly off OLD.

I think it depends on how long you communicate before meeting in real life. When I was on dating apps, I would meet people maybe a week or less after matching. So something like coffee would work because we don't know each other for real. Some friends wouldn't meet the person for months after, so I would understand a more in depth date.

"It's advised not spend a lot of time going back and forth talking on the app. That can building up expectations based on an online image.

I understood you. My point is there are other lower stakes dates that aren’t as off putting as coffee for me. Also if you had suggested another lower stakes date in place of the coffee date do you think your husband would have rejected you outright? Usually when I suggest something else most men aren’t put off by the suggestion because it’s based on a shared interest. I’m just saying talking to your dates ahead of time and planning them based on that is likely better for a lot of people.	Kicylin	reply	na	na	na	0.9976128339767456	no	strong	strong	na	blackladies

"My partner and I met 5 years ago and his career has progressed a lot since then. At the time he did not have the money to spend a lot on dates, especially on someone he didn't know. If I had insisted on doing something that he couldn't afford, we would've never gone out. But we both wanted to just grab drinks to start off, so it wasn't a problem. 

But yes, you're right, there are options other than coffee and drinks. And yes, communication is key. If yall can't even get that right before one date then it's probably not gonna work anyway. 

I just think people should be more open minded about early dates and not assume the worst because someone who doesn't even know you doesn't want to dump a bunch of money and time into hanging out with you. Sorry but shit is too expensive these days and that expectation is a bit much. Dating is just different today and its courteous to respect other people's time and money. Also I honestly think it's safer for women to be able to make a quick and easy escape if need be, not stuck and feeling obligated to hang around with some dude that they don't want to spend time with. Both parties should have a lot of flexibility early on if it doesn't feel right."	Kicylin	reply	na	na	na	0.9976128339767456	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
"I mean....if you've already ordered your food and the date starts going south, you still need to pay for your food. You can't just up and leave the restaurant. Then, when your food comes, you either decide to power through and eat quickly or ask the server to box it up. If you decide to bounce early, you have to awkwardly ask for the check, making it clear that you're having a bad time and want to make a quick exit. 

If it's coffee or drinks and shit goes bad, you can basically just go. There's no need to wait around or ask for a check. Maybe you'll have to close your tab, but that's much quicker than getting the check for a whole meal.

Dinner is definitely not as easy to get out of as coffee or drinks. A simple logisitics analysis tells you that. 

OP can do what she wants. I'm just offering my perspective and experiences. Personally, I think a whole dinner or elaborate first date is antiquated and comes from a time when a) COL was way less and b) women were expected to be nice and polite regardless of the situation they were in.

"well you’d just excuse yourself, pay at the counter or flag down a waiter, and leave. If the date said or did something inflammatory, I’ll just up and leave the guy with the bill. 

It’s not that big of a deal or an ideal if you have any decent amount of self worth. I feel like if the only thing keeping you from a dinner date or a more “high stakes” date is your inability to leave when someone crosses your boundary or makes you uncomfortable or the “logistics” of leaving, you shouldn’t be dating.

I live in a VHCOL city but a simple dinner or lunch never costs more than $30. It also never last more than 2 hours. If I’m going to get all dressed up and go across town, no way I’m just going for coffee and basically a business meeting. Dinner/lunch or activity dates (not hiking or a walk) gives you a lot to talk about rather than just going for coffee."	Kicylin	reply	na	na	na	0.9976128339767456	no	no	no	na	blackladies
"It's shitty to imply that someone has no or low self worth just because they're more comfortable with low stakes dates to start. Or that they shouldn't be dating at all because they dont want to start off with dinner with a stranger. You can do you, but you don't have to be an asshole about it. People have different preferences, and that's fine.

Neither my standards or self worth is low. Again, I am engaged to a really great dude. We just bought a house and are both doing really well career wise. I recently finished up a rigorous MPH program at Berkeley and I would have had a much tougher time juggling work and school had I not had his support the whole time. I finished with a high GPA and landed a competitive fellowship with the CDC after graduation. Meals were always cooked, the house was always clean, and I still had me-time despite my busy schedule all because my partner took on the brunt of household maintenance and chores while also working long hours. Does any of this sound like I have low standards or low self worth? I wouldn't have chosen him as a partner if he wasn't able to help me build the kind of future that I want for myself. All of this and we just started out with a simple first date. Just drinks.

"my really good freind in college who is turkish, is kind of avoiding me. We havent fought and nothing has happened but everything is different and it does hurt.

In the begining of our freindship, we hung out a lot, had sleepovers, her mom would pick us up from school and we would do stuff together.  I even made plans with her in the summer to go a cat cafe which she likes, and on that day she cancelled on me because of an anxiety attack which didnt seem truthful for some reason. Another time, she sent me a message asking me to see a movie with her the next day, then immediately deleted the invite ( i dont think she knew i saw it already) and then she said i shouldnt worry about the deleted text and she needed to leave school early the next day "" as she had something important to do"". When she cancelled the cat cafe hang out, she didnt even bother to reschedule another time. Now she's been posting herself going out to places to eat, and seems like shes hanging out with a guy ( kind of posting his arm and the two plates of food ). This one time, we didnt talk for weeks and when we finally met up, it seemed she had been occupied with a guy and she talked about how things didnt work out and they had been hanging out a lot. Seems like she ignored me for a while because she was involved with a guy.  She Constantly changes her whatsapp pictures but wouldnt reply messages and then reached out to me to be her reference for a job ( which i accepted) and she never messaged me again. 

Ive been such a girls girl my whole life, even before i knew what being a girls girl meant, growing up with sisters, going to all girls high school, i dont see my girl freinds as competition ever, and i love nuturing my female freindships more than anything and hanging around my black and non black female freinds, i love womanhood and everything about female freindships. But now i feel so hurt that my freind has kind of love-bombed me and abandon me for no reason. I have female freinds who invite me out, and make plans with me so i dont see my bad aura or energy being a cause for this drift with me and her. I dont know whats going on.

This is how angry I get when I see posts in here about luxury and generational wealth. So you want to become a white man? And that’s part of the problem, we can’t band together and shut shit down until they meet our demands because some of us don’t actually demand that people are clothed and fed. There’s plenty of people in our own community who do not care about anyone else as long as their bills are paid, don’t care about child slaves mining minerals for our tech as long as they can show off a new iPhone.	1985throwaway85	reply	na	na	na	0.9986475110054016	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

"I’m with you on the outrageous bs. 

We are looking for a home, a starter home. And there lies the problem. HCOL area, most homes start at 5-600k and that may ensue a bidding war. These aren’t fully updated homes either, these are homes that the seller never touched a hammer in 30 yrs living there. Easily will need another 100k in repairs- but want 500k for a 2 to 3 bedroom home with 1 or god forbid 1/1.5 baths. 

Are you kidding me? So I start looking around the area, and lo and behold I find some vacant homes. 

Looking into it, seems the owners died. Try to find heirs, none. Try to find mortgage lenders- mortgage was paid off. So.. ok tax office for the county then. Nope- they don’t want to sell the home. Home of dead people.. first you need to push it though probate court (which may take years!) and then off to the highest cash buyer it goes… WTH?!? So how many homes are out there’re just sitting vacant and rotting because people haven’t noticed them yet? We have a housing shortage right?? Seems like it’s a man made one to me. 

These auction and short sale sights are more of the same. If I had $500,000 cash would I be on this auction site? 

I’m disheartened and quite frankly angry with this fucked up system we live in, where people who got there homes for 90k 60 yrs ago, think you putting anything under 400k for a starter home is insulting. 

And god forbid we use a federally backed loan, that my husband almost died at war for- we are skipped over entirely. But thank our troops right?

I'm so SICK of the fucking cost of living there's not enough input for the output, just like OP said.

You can't budget your way out of housing costing nearly 50% or more of your income, and food going through the roof. Those are necessities and you can't not purchase them. 

Like, goddamn a pack of 24 brown eggs is 7.89. At a wholesale retailer? EGGS? remember when eggs and rice was a struggle meal? That's filet mignon now.

Our gov't and these companies that lobby should be ashamed. We need a national strike like yesterday. 

But people can't organize if they're working every moment of every day. People can't organize if they're worried about their children starving. People can't organize if the threat of homelessness is constantly looming over their heads.

People can't strike and peacefully demonstrate when they're rewarded with police brutality!

"Sooo my mom has always been very entitled and selfish but lately she’s been way more dramatic.

Her previous apt was going up in rent so her best friend for over two decades let her stay with her. She was asking for only $700/mo. which in this economy is a steal but she was only paying her half that and not even on time. Mind you she did the same thing when she stayed with my older sister. She says she’ll pay when she wants but if someone did this to her she would be upset. 

She had a guy she was dating and because he had a work emergency and missed her birthday plans she up and left to Kentucky to hang with family. Her best friend and hair dresser had plans to surprise her and were blowing her phone up to check on her and she told them to leave her alone but still got upset that they didn’t continue calling her.


She has open court cases at her previous full time job and now her part time job because she has been getting upset and telling folks she’s going to beat their a$$. Her friends and the guy she’s dating don’t want to be around her anymore and it’s sad. 

My sister and I were thinking of setting up an family therapy session at my place to get the help. Her friend thinks she may have HPD and the symptoms match her actions perfectly but I know I can’t diagnose her.

This is only a portion of her crazy antics..

"Your intentions are good but most adults don't want to be told anything negative about themselves unless they are proactively seeking improvement in some aspect of their life. 

Maybe she'll see this intervention from a place of love, but it could also backfire and it may be seen as y'all trying to gang up on her.

My advice is more for you - you need to set firm boundaries about the extent you are willing to help if her actions lead her to become unhoused or otherwise financially unstable, or if she crosses a line with disrespecting you (be it verbal or physical abuse). Even if you don't say it to her, you need to know for yourself.

It's hard to watch people you love make really bad decisions over and over, but they are grown. Again, if she wanted to change, she would seek help but unfortunately, some people have to hit a rock bottom, and some will never change.

Even if it is health related, like a mental breakdown or brain tumor, she will have to seek treatment herself and want to change. 

But then again, you start off by saying she's always been entitled, and my experience is that with age, those personalities just dig their heels in more. 

I feel for you and hope you have a positive outcome. 💜

"Or is this just news to me and I’m late asf lol? 

I regularly avoid most media sites now and limit my time if I do, and even on Reddit I avoid browsing on the popular page. But recently when I *do* check out what everyone’s talking about, I sometimes come across some dumbass take that gets hundreds or thousands of likes/upvotes that usually goes along the lines of “black [girls] need to see themselves to be represented meanwhile all races of men related to goku” (sometimes posted by black men too) or some variant of “aren’t y’all the reAl RacIsTs for only relating to a character if they look like you?! What if wHiTe pEoPle said that?!”

Idk where this take came from, because growing up black lots of black adults and kids watched the majority white media (and Japanese anime) and still related to, liked, and felt empathy for the characters that didn’t look not a thing like us. And black girls around me regularly related to and loved Rapunzel, Mulan, Violet from the Incredibles, and everyone else lmao. How is getting excited for characters that look like us being on the screen portraying a main character equal to ONLY relating to black characters? I feel like this is some type of projection.

And not long ago and still today, any role played by a black character even if it was FANTASY was criticized and I remember being annoyed as a teen in the 2010s with all the ‘colorblind’ folks going “I don’t mind black characters but what’s the REASON for them to be black?! Otherwise it’s forCeD diversity!!!”, as if there needs to be any reason for a character to be black besides their fictional black parents feeling freaky one night and proceeding to organically produce their black children, who then grew up to become a black character in this show, book, movie lmao. They were the ones who couldn’t empathize with a random black character on the screen unless they had a reason to exist in the plot that tickled them right (like the supportive bff), but now I’m seeing posts where they’re trying to uno reverse the narrative and act like WE are the ones who can’t relate to someone who doesn’t look like us?! 

This is sort of a rant because I don’t comment directly on their brain dead takes anymore like I used to years ago, so it’s kinda pent up lol.

"I know. I know! But I’ve been thinking, high school was a lot simpler than adult life; no bills, no worry of career progression, so naive and for some un-jaded, no worry of ‘when will I get married’ and making friends was easier. Yea there were petty people but my biggest concern was picking out classes, signing up for an activity and being hungry throughout the school day. I’m starting to understand why there’s such an obsession with HS in media and real life; you had more independence/autonomy than the earlier years of your childhood but not as many responsibilities as an adult. You also had your whole life a head of you. I don’t feel the same about college, college was stressful and very political.

"No. I sucked in high school. Do I wish I had a do over with the knowledge and perspective I have now? Absolutely! Do I wish to go back to that anxious crying in the bathroom several times a week and then several times a day by senior year thankful I live in a predominantly white area so no one can tell I’ve been crying in the bathroom when I come back to class adolescent hell? I don’t think I would survive it a second time. I barely survived it the first time. And I wasn’t even that nice a kid. A lot of the time I was the one being a jerk and doing the bullying. If it was this stressful for me I can’t imagine how awful it was for everyone else.

Media idealizes high school because of course it’s super easy compared to adulthood. But it’s only easier with perspective and true perspective only comes with age. When you’re living it the stuff that we think of as no big deal now is a very big deal. It’s kind of like how comedies are never comedies for the characters in them - they’re being tortured. Can you imagine waking up every day with the knowledge that you have to survive the next seven hours without doing or saying anything stupid or you will die of embarrassment? Now same scenario except you also lack impulse control and have raging hormones.

You could not pay me to go back to any part of my childhood… the first part of college. Hell, you could not pay me to go back to last year and I’m 32. We idolize being young and the patriarchy places value on being innocent and virginic but honestly I’m 32, childless, grandchildless, and I’m ready to be a grandma.

"A lot of people have romanticized about high school and the period of time, from like the 1950s and early 2010s. People say those times were great and near untainted, unlike today. Technology wasn’t so encompassing and the world had more common sense and real progress that was pretty fun. Pop culture was always the best of whoever was of the age of the time.


Admittedly, I’m not one of those people. I don’t have any desire or passion to go back to the past. Definitely not going back to high school (late 90s/early 2000s). It had it’s moments, but I liked elementary school (2nd-6th), college, and my post-college years much more. But, I wouldn’t go back to those times under almost zero circumstances, except for a few things could be changed.

Also, elder millennial here, so Columbine happened my freshman year of high school, Y2k was my sophomore year of high school,  Bush vs Gore happened my Junior year and 9/11 happened my senior year of high school.

  And even though I'm only 21 I do feel like I'm behind. Sometimes I want to go back and do things differently. I did not have good grades and I took a gap year and then dropped out of CC after a semester. I feel really insecure about that. Even though I know college isn't everything. 

But, at the same time, most of those friends were ""fake"". Treated me like a second option and constantly made me wonder why I wasn't good enough to hang out with outside of school. And with academics, I highly suspect that I have undiagnosed ADHD and I was also depressed which made it hard to find the motivation to do anything.

Ain't no way. No way in hell.

9/11 happened in my sophomore year. And Virginia at that time was not a blue state. I lived in a  county that was and remains Republican stronghold. So I got to sit and hear - for the rest of my 3 damn years in that school - about how bombing the hell out of the Iraq/Afghanistan was a good thing and how incredibly anti-American I was for not being for those fucked up, bullshit wars. I was also quiet, a bit weird and strange, and a Black nerd. And I was about 40lbs heavier in high school than I am now.  The academic aspects of high school were fine. But everything else? So no, I don't miss it.

Graduated in 2004, haven't talked to anyone I went to school with since maybe...2 years after we graduated? Coming up on that 20th reunion and I won't be going. Didn't attend the 10th either.

Nope, although it wasn’t as hellish as middle school.

I still regret sucking up to this day, wasting all that time to get the attention from someone that’s not worthy of me. I’d probably be a better artist by now lol.

I do miss the elaborate plans we had to steal more bread because they only gave us so little. I miss running away from teachers and jumping through Windows, wearing a skirt and nothing but a jersey without a t-shirt or bra inside because you didn't want to increase your laundry load and there were no boys so it didn't matter 😂, serving punishments together, sports days when we finally got to see boys and how fascinating it was. But I can relate to the whole simpler times. I didn't even now what I wanted but at that time I was sure and confident I'd graduate college, get a good job, get married , start a family and live happily ever after.

"I was looking for a comment like this one! I had the *exact* same experience. Elementary and middle school were awful (I got bullied and barely had friends), and when I got to high school, everything turned around. 

My high school was amazing. It was the first school I had ever gone to where every single teacher cared about their job and their students. I also had a lot of friends in high school (who I also drifted away from shortly after graduation).

I went straight into college during the pandemic and couldn't move on campus until my sophomore year. It was awful. I'm also very shy and socially anxious, so it wasn't easy for me to make friends at all. I also went to a PWI, which was a lot more difficult than I initially thought it would be (since I had grown up and lived in a primarily black city my entire life).

"I grew up in a very diverse suburb, and my friendships reflected that as a child. However, as I got older, my friend group became more and more Black because I just naturally gravitate to them more and they were generally more communicative and straight-up. I had some non-Black friends in high school, but I don't know, they seemed so insincere at times. Also, talking to them about dating life was so uncomfortable to me, because their experiences are just... different. They just didn't seem to get me in those fundamental levels... it was surface-level.

Now I am a sophomore in a PWI, and I surround myself in spaces where I feel comfortable, which is my school's African student association, BW association, and BSU. But, honestly, I have to say that I haven't really made many true friendships in the time I attended the school, and I've gone out of my comfort zone and sacrificed my mental health in the process. But after that experience, I'm wondering now if I was more open in my friendship preferences, that I could possibly make friends.

Recently, I thought I was making class ""friends"" in my summer course, and they both happened to be Asian. We joked around, complained about our school, talked about our lives and summers, but then, when it came to doing the classwork, I consistently felt invalidated. They would ignore my answers I would provide to the questions even though I was usually right and overexplained everything whenever I ask a simple clarifying question. I just cannot imagine being in a friendship situation where I feel belittled like that. I'm good enough to be their comedic relief but otherwise they see me as useless and dumb? (and baybeeeee, one thing I'm very confident about is my intelligence, and even if I wasn't, what gives them the right to act like that?). 

I've dealt with too much BS in my life in general that I just do not know if I should even entertain the idea of friendships that aren't Black. Is it gonna be another headache and draining? But I'm just really thinking that it might unfair to do, and I might be blocking possibly great future friendships. Idkkkk, this is just weird.

"I think it really just depends, maybe talk before becoming actual friends because I find even with some black girls that I have met (in college at least) there is a disconnect because some may only talk to me if they need help with work and some may say embarrassing stuff out loud that makes me uncomfortable. That is obviously NOT exclusive to black girls and I’ve had the same experiences with non black people, im just saying that it can happen. In terms of friendships with white people… I personally don’t gravitate toward white people when it comes to friends anyways but if I find that someone would be a good friend I’m open to the possibility. I think friendship is truly a journey and I hope you find great friends. If you want friends that will likely relate more to you maybe looking for black friends exclusively is a better idea, if not then I would suggest making friends openly but also keeping an ear out for questionable things before getting too close.

I don’t think you’re overthinking this at all. I find that my non black friends do not understand my struggle mostly with dating (although I’m not too interested in it nowadays) but it would be nice to talk to someone that relates to what I’m saying in that aspect sometimes. But on the other hand maybe there is another POC girl that relates to the dating struggle in a similar way, who really knows. Friendship is really not a one size fits all. Good luck!"

"Feeling really frustrated and I need to vent/find out if I'm not alone in this.

Ok, as the headline indicates, I have natural, 4c hair. I really never let anyone else handle my hair, so I've had to get really knowledgeable about its care. I don't use heat, I barely use tools, aside from hair scissors, and I'm just really meticulous and gentle during detangling. For the most part, I keep my hair in braids.

Well, I've been dealing with some medical issues in the past year and my hair has become neglected and a bit is matted. It's taking me a long time, little by little to detangle it, and it's honestly frustrating.

So, coming across a post elsewhere (in a not-Black hair-centric sub), I saw it was suggested to go to a beauty academy, as detangling depression hair is a thing some of them do.

Did a little research, found a beauty school in my city that claims to specialize in Black hair. Call them up, get who I am certain is a Black woman on yhe phone, book an appointment. 

Show up, the receptionist and another woman are at the reception desk (the receptionist was a very lightlight-skinned BW with hair that makes me believe she's mixed, the other woman was... Not Black, but trying her hardest to sound like it 🤨). First red flag.

I look around the room and fewer than half of the stylists I'm training there are Black, the other stylists are talking in fake Blaccents and my skin is crawling. I get sat w/a young BW (glimmer of hope?) and the Blaccent reception lady is coming over.

I was so desperate, it's taking me forever to tackle my hair, my hair is thick and about bra-strap length.

Why do these women start grabbing pieces of my hair and TEARING THEM APART!?! Crunch, rip, snap, crackle. My heart is racing.

We're not two minutes in and I'm asking them to please stop, stop touching my hair, this Blaccent woman is still in my hair and trying to convince me this is the only way.

I'm on the verge of losing it internally, but keeping my cool bc her paws were still in my hair and I don't want her doing something petty like tearing more of it.

Why is it so hard to find a place that really knows how to service out hair without treating it like an object of scorn and disrespect? Rhetorical, I know it's anti-Blackness. Internalized or otherwise.

I'm almost ready to make an entire career change because, I KNOW our hair doesn't need to be heat-blasted and raked through with reckless abandon in order to look good.

I'm really frustrated I let these people play in my hair, but lesson learned.

So, I'm asking the naturals to weigh in: would y'all pay extra to go to a salon that doesn't use heat before braiding, doesn't really use combs?"	wheredoesbabbycakes	post	22.465196510127615	female	White	0.9990398287773132	na	na	na	11	blackladies
I would strongly suggest downloading the app “StyleSeat”. It will show you a list of salons near you that specialize in natural hair, locs, braids, weaves, wig installs and silk presses. I’m sure a lot of the stylist would be able to help you detangle your hair without damaging it, and maybe help teach you some simple protective styles you can do at home.

"For the story you mentioned I think you should try to go to a salon that isn’t a class setting. Maybe try searching for natural hair salons in general because I feel like beauty schools will do whatever they want, that’s why they were feeling your hair and not listening because they see you as a head model instead of an actual person.

For my hair at least, heat is not the enemy, although I’m VERY particular about the heat I use. I only use my revair dryer to stretch my hair and I don’t use a blow dryer with a comb attachment. I haven’t had a better experience with anything when my hair is styled from wet hair, if anything it’s more tangled when I get to wash day and when styling it’s harder to grip because I like to use different moisturizers and Shea butter. I think avoiding combs wouldn’t be a bad idea but I can’t guarantee that a lot of stylists will do a thorough job and finger detangling every clients hair. In the natural hair world doing your own hair is probably the best option, I know you mentioned it being frustrating so maybe do small sections at a time."	wheredoesbabbycakes	reply	na	na	na	0.9990398287773132	no	no	no	na	blackladies

I’d say just plan on take in a day to detangle it on your own. Put on a show to binge or movie and work through it. Before I got locs I loved Pantene’s cowash. It was great for detangling. I almost miss it."	wheredoesbabbycakes	reply	na	na	na	0.9990398287773132	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

"Hey yall. So I am a 23 year old Black Trans Woman and I've had a weird dating history. I also escort and I have done various forms of sex work since I was 18. I've stopped at times when I've gotten in relationships only for a few of the men I've dated to cheat on me with other trans escorts. Ironically during this time they'd wanted me to stop.  A lot of family members and friends consider me high maintenence.  I keep my hair and nails done,  I've had a handful of cosmetic procedures/enhancements,  I workout 5x a week,  and I'm very emotionally intelligent. I go through periods of time where I do stay single then occasionally I'll jump on a dating app for a week or two because i get lonely. Most of my clients aren't open about their attraction to trans women so dating one of them is out of the question.  The guys I have dated a lot of them are successful men but some of them get turned off when some things they use to impress me doesn't impress me at all.  Like I've had guys brag about bottle service when I don't like night clubs or talk about how they travel over seas a lot when I've only been to my grandma's home country when I was younger.  But a lot of guys don't like me being emotionally vulnerable at all.  Tbh,  I think it's the #1 reason why I'm single besides me being trans.  I've had a lot of guys open up to me about their relationship history and even childhood trauma but when I get open about stuff in my life I do get ghosted. In fact I've gotten ghosted by most guys in my life.  There's only one guy I dated after my last serious relationship I talk to occasionally.  He's dated 3 other women that I know of since we stopped seeing each other romantically. He also was one of the only people that got me something for my birthday too this past year.  But,  he did also tell me at a restaurant that he didn't want to date me seriously 2 years ago.  I understand that but it still hurts. The last guy I dated broke up with me when we were out with his friends. I'd opened up about my dating history to him the night before and I think he thought because no one wants me long term that I'm not worth dating.  I honestly think that's how most men think.  I was neglected and abused at different points in my childhood and I did have to teach myself a lot about dating and friendships but I feel very behind in life with it. I'm also just now rebuilding my life too after some financial hardship. A lot of other friends I've had in the past (people of all genders) when we get into arguments the number one thing people throw in my face is that I can't keep a man or saying that I'm only good for sex. I've ended a lot of friendships because of this.  I recently cut things off with a long time friend because she kept saying that no one will ever want me.  That I'm only good for my body and that every man ghosts me.  I hate it but I'd be lying if I said it didn't hurt.  It hurts most when it comes from other women especially other trans women. I also do go back and forth if I even want to date anyone ever again.  I am a hopeless Romantic though.  

Honestly,  I don't know what to ask.  Do yall have any tips on raising my self esteem.  It wains at times.  I want to take a break from dating but I do feel lonely and I don't really have anyone I'm close with in this new city I'm in.

"There's no timeline for these things.  The answer to that is ingrained in you and it'll take some searching to find.  Therapy/ counseling/talking it out with a trusted advisor.  Get to know yourself.  Be willing to ask yourself the hard questions.  WRITE! WRITE! WRITE!  Something about taking the thoughts from your head and putting them on paper helps.  I would write down all the negative shit I was thinking.  Then I would answer with why it was wrong.  Or paint ""lies"" over it.  I'd create goals, easy goals at first, then harder.  Mark off my accomplishments.  I did a lot of mirror work.  Forced myself to look at me and tell me what was great remind me of how awesome every piece of me was.  I got penpals from random places.  I read more.  Remind myself that the same mind that harms can heal.

You're young, don't feel the need to rush to date.  Pursue what makes you happy, that's where your love is, where you'll find the people that will enrich you.  Pursue a hobby or try something new.  I recommend gardening, there's something about watching a plant grow and all that can go into it or go wrong...

Your self esteem will wane at times, that's a good time to check in with yourself.  I may sound crazy but I will have a whole conversation with me if I have to.  That's where the writing helps.

"So after speaking with a family member who’s an ER/urgent care provider I think it’s important to send the message I received to you beautiful women. 
My family member has been having an uptick in sexual related traumas (mainly vaginal tearing) and stds (specifically in the black community). 
A lot of the women come in not understanding that sexual encounters are to be enjoyed and not painful. Meaning that being able to take a bigger size should not come before your enjoyment.
Also never let a man convince you to take off the condom. If he’s using excuses with you then he’s using excuses with everyone. My family member said that she’s had so many women coming in who’s partners told them they can’t feel anything with condoms on. If that’s truly the case then there’s a chance they could be suffering from death grip. Meaning that he won’t get much more enjoyment doing it without the condom.

">> I think you might be in the ""natural over chemical"" bandwagon since you prefer olive oil over water based lubricant. 

How condescending. Being proactive about my health in a way that you either do not understand or do not find necessary is not tantamount to being on some kind of bandwagon, which implies that I’m following some trend for the sake of following some trend rather than making a grown ass decision as a grown ass woman about my reproductive health, which I am, and Idrmfc who has a problem with that.

>> However, consider this, you use olive oil to cook and prepare food 

Yes, meaning that it is food safe. I’m unsure whether you are implying that there is an issue with this or merely drawing an arbitrary comparison with water. 

>> while WATER based lubricant has water which is a natural solvent, cleaning agent, and you SHoWER  with it. 

Yes… water-based does indeed mean that water is an ingredient. But water is not what I would refer to as a cleaning agent. Further, the vagina is self-cleaning and alcohol is a natural solvent, too, but you don’t see me shoving it up my vaginal canal. 

You’re drawing totally arbitrary points of comparison and I really can’t imagine why you felt the need to get all up in my grill about this, but maybe my response will help you out. 

“Water-based” does not only mean made with water. It also means that water is among other ingredients. For real, have you ever thought critically about those other ingredients? Personally, I don’t want propelyne glycol (I don’t know what to spell that tbf but if you’ve bothered researching lube you know what I’m talking about), an array of other trendy oils like primrose oil for example which is great for your face but which contains compounds that many would call medicinal. I don’t have an need for anything medicinal down there . 

I don’t have a need for *anything* being used internally at this time so it really isn’t a real point of concern. 

>> Which of the two seems more comfortable to be inside your body?

The oil... But I thought I been said that. 

I don’t want whatever is in lube all up inside of me. It contains ingredients I often can’t pronounce and can’t confidently determine are not disruptive of hormonal processes.

It helps prevent weird injuries when you’re in different positions, for example pretzel time.

I’ve had many fantastic first, second, third etc dates and the men I see are always really interested in me. I’m going on dates with 2 separate men right now. Both have good careers, smart, good-looking, gentlemenly and very into me. 

I like them in terms of getting to know them but I don’t know if I like them beyond that. I sorta feel like I prevent myself from genuinely liking a man or maybe just haven’t TRULY liked someone where I saw a significant future. Time after time a good man is served to me on a platter and all of a sudden I don’t have the appetite for him after a while. It may be too soon to tell, I’ve only been on a few dates with each.

I’m also someone who generally delays having sex until I’ve been dating someone for a while. That said, I will do other sex-adjacent things with people I date prior to that. 

Idk I feel like I’m moving too fast in an unknown direction sometimes. I love being alone cause I know what to expect with myself and I like my own company. I feel like every time I start dating again I think I know what I want but when that is presented to me I don’t know anymore.

My situation isn’t the same as yours, but to answer your question. It’s really hard for me to develop feelings for someone. People will be talking about crushes and I often feel a little left out.

The only two times I’ve developed feelings was as a middle schooler to my best friend who I already developed an emotional bond with and now, but honestly the feelings aren’t even legitimate this time.

"This has been me while dating (mid 30s)

Personally, I realized it just takes me a little longer to like the person. Chemistry for me is obvious on the first date, but then my brain shuts down to analyze the inputs if that makes sense

It's the cautious/logical side of me that takes over vs emotion. Especially when they hit the marks, treat me well, my brain gets a lil suspicious as if this can't be real/some red flag is going to appear

Last year I met a man, had incredible first 3 dates. He was very upfront about what he wanted, asked to be exclusive after date 3, and I rolled with it

"hey from one side of the spectrum 👋🏽

it could be a number of things going on for you that really only you can determine. could be little things turning you off in the process you’re not fully aware of, could be previous bad experiences tainting your current ones, could be the aro/ace or comp-het thing. you’ll know it when you parse it.

i’ve come to grips with myself about similar not too long ago. i love male bodies — don’t really care much for what else comes with them in non-sexual/non-platonic scenarios. we can be friends all day but don’t catch feelings, in other words. and that was a whole line of logic to tread for me because it was hard to negotiate “no i just like sex” without feeling some type of internalized misogyny about it, or feeling “othered” because other people can function in relationships fine while hearing about older friends’ 10+ year anniversaries makes me sick to my stomach when i try to picture myself in that situation

This is close to my experience. Most of the time I thought I liked someone it was just people pleasing. Or I would idealize people. I think those experiences left me drained.

"Compulsive Heterosexuality, basically participating in heterosexuality because it’s what’s expected of you without realizing you aren’t actually attracted to men. 

For me, it was taking my obsession with wanting to be desired by men (thanks to patriarchy convincing me that men were the key holders for validation) as an attraction to men. Only wanting to sleep with men for that validation because it never was because they woo’d me or gave me a primal desire. 

Meanwhile, when I first dated a girl I literally wanted to be *inside her skin* because cuddling naked didn’t feel close enough.

"Hey y’all! I know this question has been asked a bunch, but I’m planning to move in about a year. I’m originally from the Midwest (Indianapolis, Indiana). I moved to LA in 2019 but came back because of COVID, I LOVED it there. But the cost of living is ridiculous. I’m 22, I have no kids, 2 dogs, and I’m in a relationship. My boyfriend isn’t sure if he’s moving with me, but I’m not going to let him hold me back. I struggle with seasonal depression, so I want  somewhere with decent/good weather year around. I also want somewhere with a decent cost of living. As far as a nightlife, I’m not a huge club girl, BUT I do want a pretty lively social scene. It doesn’t have to just be clubs, but any kind of event. It’s also important to me that it’s diverse, and I don’t have to worry about not being around US. I have even considered moving out of the country. So far on my list I have: 


-  Houston 
- Dallas
- Phoenix  (I’ve read it’s not very diverse)
- Washington D.C.
- San Diego 
- San Antonio (I know it’s more Latinx than Black American)
- London
- Maryland 
- Luxembourg (read this in other threads)

Definitely houston or Dallas. I have lived in San Antonio and it is great to VISIT but as a young person it’s not really an amazing place to live.

"I’m new to NYC and want to reenter the dating scene. I’ve been told I can meet black men at clubs, bars, and parties, but I’m very introverted so I avoid those places. Also I  doubt I’d mesh with the type of men who go to those places often

The activities that I do enjoy and go to often are almost entirely nonblack. My job is also mainly nonblack, so finding a man at work is out of the question.

I don’t have an existing friend group in NYC (or in the entire USA, really) so meeting a man through friends is out of the question.

Tinder doesn’t let me filter by race, hinge only shows me red flags, and BLK was…just no.

Wait, what activities do you enjoy? I feel like anything that is usually non-black there is a black subset of the population in New York City that are also into it. Think about the goth scene. I know of literally two white goth individuals. In the early 2000s I used to go to many parties and most people going were either black or Spanish. Now, from that scene where are the parties that you still got one that were mostly in a white space, but I choose not to attend there. You might need help finding them, but I guarantee you whatever you're into there is a group of black people that do it somewhere in the city.	throwthataway2723	reply	na	na	na	0.9985201954841614	no	strong	strong	na	blackladies

"*This is definitely more of an r/OffMyChest post, but I feel more comfortable posting here lol even though it doesn't have much to do with being black. Hope that's ok and thanks for reading if you do.*

I distinctly remember when I was like 19 and some dormmates  were chatting about their dream weddings, or what they would name their kids. They asked me and were shocked I'd never really thought about that stuff. I shrugged and said all I've ever wanted is a cute little apartment, a pet, a nice job, time to enjoy life and travel with my friends, and peace. I figured by like 25 at least I would have that, and a long term partner as well. 

I'm 27 now and I can't even accomplish the first goal. After being at home with my parents postgrad/through Covid (Free but I paid with my mental health), I pushed myself into a career I knew I hated just to escape. It's very common in my culture to push your kids into this career, as my other first gen friends deal with the same pressure. My parents have hung it over my head my whole life and admittedly ruined their relationship with my sister over it. 

I've said since I was a teen I never wanted it. But I got desperate to leave and now here I am, thousands of miles from everyone I know and love, did a year of school and now doing the job. Not only do I hate it even more than I expected, as it's slowly ruining my physical and mental health, I racked up even more educational debt AND!! I still can't afford a place by myself. And the health insurance it offers doesn't cover therapy which I desperately need.

I know plenty of millennials are in this situation, as many of my close friends live at home or have just recently moved out. But even knowing I'm not alone, I'm still frustrated and upset with myself. I feel like all of my work was for nothing, I gave up on my own personal boundaries, dignity, health, and sacrificed so much for nothing. I bought into the lie about making good grades and focusing in school and how that would get me the life that I want. When people compliment me for having two degrees or congratulate me on my most recent one, I just feel defeated and empty. And to make matters worse, I got a service ""scholarship"" when I came to school here that chains me to the state for four years. 

But one single year of paying rent here is enough to pay back the entire scholarship, and then some. So now I'm wondering if I should just go back to square one and move back in with my parents, who live in a cheaper state, for a year to pay off the loan. Which was what I was trying to escape in the first place. 

I feel like I'm in between a rock and a hard place. And the long term partner is nowhere on the horizon, thats for sure. Why is it so hard to achieve the most basic parts of adulthood?!"	firelord_catra	post	30.58032064295365	female	White	0.9992450475692749	na	na	na	3	blackladies

"My mom is taking care of me while I recuperate from surgery. While I'm grateful for her presence, she has caused stress for me since she arrived last week. I can't walk that well, but I maneuvered my way to the kitchen and I saw that she had dirty dishes(which included food wrappers) and an empty juice bottle in or near the sink. She did the same last week and I let her know that my building manager let us know to be mindful of keeping our homes clean due to rodents and bugs. Her response was, ""Well have you seen any""? 

I try to keep my condo as neat as I can and obviously do not want to see bugs, etc. I tell her to properly dispose of trash and she says, ""Well I haven't made it there yet"". My trash is also in the kitchen in my condo. She keeps saying that she is on vacation and to stop pestering her. I do not know what to do, but I don't like that she isn't respectful of my space and she feels like she can get away with it.

How can I go about resolving this?"	Teesmartgirl	post	32.80474257921272	male	White	0.998960018157959	na	na	na	30	blackladies

My mom helped watch our toddler a little and just stayed at our house to be nearby. We came home to find our house a wreck. It’s unlike her and honestly makes me concerned for her more than angry. Tried talking to her about it and she got extremely defensive and denied everything, so I just told her to please take care of herself and now I’m just gonna take space. 

I agree with kindly dismissing her. Make it out like she’s done so much for you and you don’t need the help anymore, but you’re so grateful.

"I have the same issue with my mom.

I enjoy her company when she stays over occasionally on the weekends, but I can no longer deal with the mess she leaves behind. My husband makes little comments about it, so I think he is starting to get annoyed by it. 

Ex: My mom loves to cook. Unfortunately, she doesn't do the ""cook & clean method."" Let's just say she cooked breakfast and left all the used/dirty items on the counter and sink. She will then start on dinner with the same mess from breakfast. I have told her plenty of times to stop doing that, but she does it out of habit. It has gotten to the point where I have to go in the kitchen and clean up as she cooks. I often feel like the parent because I'm talking to her about the mess she's creating while I'm cleaning.

"I started taking accelerated online classes almost 3 years ago because I couldn’t drive myself to my college campus and I didn’t want to stay in the dorms. I’ve learned that online classes can be a struggle just like regular school because it takes so much more motivation and you can get behind very quickly. My classes are set up one at a time and I have at least 4-5 assignments every week. My classes also last around 5-6 weeks. (So basically I get a whole semesters worth of work in a lil over a month) 

My sister told me a while ago (in so many words) that because I don’t have to actually go to school that I have so much free time that I’m wasting. She went on this whole rant about how I’m “wasting my life” and I think that’s a wild thing to say considering that I traveled three different times last year and went to concerts. I also hang out with friends when I can. Just because she sees me at home doesn’t mean that I don’t do anything else. I also work 4 days a week. That pissed me off so bad because online school is still work. Just because it’s not as much as normal school doesn’t make it any less stressful. I don’t get a summer break. I get a week break in between classes, sometimes two but for the most part, it’s constant work. I normally stuff most of my assignments into one evening so I end up spending way more time on my assignments than I probably should’ve. School is exhausting and will always be exhausting despite how you do it.

 At the end of the day, just because I don’t go out and party every weekend doesn’t mean I’m wasting my life. I also don’t have all the free time in the world despite doing online school and I have no idea why she thinks that. I just hate being told things like that because then those words get into my head and I start wondering if maybe I’m complaining for no reason. Maybe I’m not doing enough. Maybe I should go out clubbing (I’ve never been and I’m 22) and just do more. I hate feeling like I’m missing out and I never had those thoughts until she got into my head. It bothers me so much and every now and then those words will come back into my mind and make me question myself."

"Ok, so me and my bf have been dating for 4 months now and it's been great. However, I'm getting annoyed by the weird looks or comments I would get from black men. It doesn't happen all the time, but once in a while. When in reality, it shouldn't be happening at all.

Here are some examples:

1: This guy I use to work with (black man) seen a post I made about me and my bf at a pride festival on snapchat.  He slides up asking who he is. I say that he's my bf. He says: ""Really? Is this your first white guy?"" And later on, goes on to say: ""You switching sides"". Like wtf???

2: We walk around at night in a urban area (downtown, so it's a lot of people around) it was a bit crowded in one area as we walk holding hands. These two black men go past us and I hear one of them say ""....fucking white boy"" or something??? It was the last part of his sentence. Idk if maybe he was talking about something else, so I could be wrong.

3: This just happened to me like less than an hour ago. I went to my bf's house real quick (it's night time btw) to get something that I left at his apartment. It was these two African men talking in the parking lot when I arrived. They paid me no mind. But when my bf walks me back to my car and gives me a kiss goodbye, I get into my car and start to back out of my space noticing that they're staring at me. Not even trying to hide it. Even when I drive off they were still staring. Idk what THAT was about, but it's weird that it happened the moment my white bf kisses me goodbye when they barely acknowledged me before.

Idk, it's just weird. I just hate hearing these stories of BW being ridiculed for dating outside their race and I hate experiencing it even more!"	GamerGurl3980	post	21.880483903310015	female	White	0.9986851811408997	na	na	na	156	blackladies

What I have observed a lot is that when most BW are dating a WM or any other race that isn’t a BM, we don’t go out of our way to smear who we are with in BMs faces. But when it’s BM and they date any other race many go our of their way to shove it in BWs faces that they are with non-black and find reasons as to “why” they don’t date/like BW. They’ll uplift everyone else but their own, many times taking part in the mistreatment of BW. It’s almost like they want to see us suffer.

Girl, just wait until you have a mixed race child. Here in Canada, MOST people don’t look at you twice. I’ve gotten the occasional surprised look from BM. But once you have a mixed kid?? WHOO, the numerous rude comments I’ve gotten from BM online and person are INSANE. I’m all kinds of “race traitor” and everything else under the sun. Good luck, sweetie.

"Oh, this is common. If there's a reaction, It's either this or they give the white man props for being with you. I've never experienced harassment myself but on vacation once in a very high Black population city, we got many many stares and mean mugs.

Back at home, we've (he) has only gotten nods and props from Black men calling him a brotha lol. Now my mom and her bf years back (early 2000s) got harassed big time by Black men, at least once. Her bf got spit on and called names from these perfect strangers for being with her.

If the situation is ever seemingly dangerous, please keep your eyes open. It sucks, but if I feel like I'm getting stared at a lot and it's a more isolated area with not many witnesses besides the people looking mean... me and my husband and now just friends! Because I don't want to take out my mace to handle a group of men that want to get super aggressive about who you date.

The poster who said BM feel they have some right to us, like property or a possession, was abso right. It's a schizophrenic kind of sensibility too. What I mean by that is, for example, I remember being out on a date in Philly. The guy was white, German native and kinda completely oblivious to what was going on, but I would notice as we'd be walking, whenever we passed a BM, there was some sort of comment (either to self or in our direction) or a stare or a straight out glare. At the same time, I also remember being in grocery stores with s brotha who was shopping with his white GF/wife/companion, who the minute he saw me in the aisle started meanmugging me in a sort of a self-defensive posture - like he was anticipating I was going to say or do something to his woman, I assumed? And all the while I was literally doing *nothing but shopping*, not looking in their direction, no engagement at all, with him cutting me glares and sprinkling tension the entire time. It's madness.

"This part! 
I have recently started dating outside my race, more seriously. I am a very very private person, no one in my family meets people that I date or friends for that matter. (I’m a mom and my family still hasn’t met my baby daddy and it’s been a decade 😂😂) 
But I am trying to get out of the place of isolation and get more involved with my family. 

But somethings have been running through my mind about what or how my family would react once I let them meet the man that I am dating. I already know they are going to ask me “so you couldn’t find a black man?” “Oh you really like them white folks huh?” I was raised by white people, boarding school kid, so why would it be a surprise to my family that I’m dating someone non black, beats me. But it’s no shocker since they were shocked when they found out I was dating an African man and not a Black American lol.

The stink eye from people is rancid but eh, not letting it ruin my day. The one time it got kinda weird was when we were in Ireland (twice). The one time I was..tipsy.. and got mouthy. Not sure if it was us or if we were American but it was just one guy and we shut that down really quick.

"Kinda sorta related, whenever I come across BW on social media who are ""alternative"" in some way to what people think of BW (introverted, plus sized, unique style or aesthetic, travel often, nerdy gamers or cosplayers, alt/goth, openly have creative hobbies, the list goes on) they are almost always with a white partner. While there's nothing *wrong* with it and I'm absolutely an advocate of go where you're wanted, it actually makes me a little sad in the sense that it seems like being in this group means you're not as likely to have a BM accept or love you. 

I mentioned it in another post, but the whole stupid thing on TikTok about ""doing this arbitrary thing means you like white men"" boils down to just calling these kind of BW whitewashed all over again. I'm also noticing a pushback yet again towards natural hair, as these same type of folks are starting to say wearing braids, twists, or just your natural hair is ""childish"" and means you like wm. And it's like, how is not sad that BW unabashedly being themselves, whether it's through their hair, interests or hobbies, is criteria to be rejected by men of their own race?

"The Cleveland area. I think maybe because it’s just so segregated? I don’t f—- with any white person so I totally get the lack of trust so maybe it’s that. 

When I was a teen there and I had a white boyfriend briefly, two Black men pulled up at a stoplight next to us one day when we were walking home from high school. Yelled to me that I was a “race traitor that was going to hell” lmao. I was shocked. Didn’t even have enough time to respond. Black dudes at school was mad cuz I was attractive and wasn’t with them. Definitely coming from a place of jealousy. 

Then more recently with my husband, no one yelled insults or said anything. But the stares we got at Walmart—- from Black men and women. It was like all eyes on us. I don’t know if they were surprised or what. Me and my husband aren’t one of those mismatched interracial couples where the white person is obviously using white privilege cuz their partner of color is out of their league. 😂 we’re more evenly matched. So maybe they thought he was cute? (The white men in that area can’t typically dress even when they are cute. Like sports team shirts and poorly fitting pants and baseball caps. 🤮) The white people we saw didn’t look on too long or seem to judge us.

"So I'm more into adult cartoons. I spend a few days last week watching Netflix's Ōoku. It's such a good anime. It's about Japan losing its male population due to a disease outbreak so the women have to take over politically, socially, and economically. It's got everything. You laugh. You cry. You get angry. You smile, you go, ""wtf?"" I walked away from that show because it was very different.

Ten Year Old Tom on Max. Tom is just trying to get through the day but his friends and family make it impossible.

Craig if The Creek. Reminds me of my childhood. It's just a fun show to watch especially the episodes where he's beefing with his older brother Bernard. His grandparents and sister are great characters. 


Occasionally I tune into Teen Titans Go. Coincidentally I've always caught the episodes where they talk about lending and loans, and taxes lmao. I didn't know the show covered stuff like that and it cracks me up. 

American Dad simply because Rogers personas make the entire show and it's basically conservative republican satire. 

Invincible on Amazon Prime if you don't mind cartoon gore. It's not at all what you thought it would be.

"Ever since 2015 (I’m about to turn 29 this year) I’ve been having a slew of health issues. It’s been a struggle to find doctors who genuinely care and are attentive and empathetic. I have a diverse team of doctors now that are great but my OBGYN visits have always been traumatic. I was diagnosed with vaginismus and hypertonic pelvic floor dysfunction and I’ve had this since I was 9 y/o. I would scream during pelvic exams, avoided using tampons, avoided relationships (I’m asexual but not sex averse) because I know I wouldn’t be able to meet my potential partners intimate needs. My old OBGYN referred me to a uro-gynecologist who suggested I get pelvic floor therapy. It need help me control my own pelvic muscles and they’re spastic I have a lot more work to do. But I transferred over to a Black female OBGYN near my school and I was still so nervous about pain. But I saw my mother and the other women in my family have horrific pregnancies and reproductive care and knew it was time to have the right OBGYN on my care team. 

 I asked her with such embarrassment to use a the smallest speculum and use a lot of lube and she actually did it and I experienced no pain just slight discomfort which I was to breath through (something I learned in pelvic floor therapy). I nearly cried. She listened to me, and my whole story, included me in my care was honest but empathetic. I told her that and I know it touched her too. 

I’m almost 30 and just know had a pleasant experienced at an OBGYN and that’s tragic but I’m also proud of how far I’ve come. Ever since my cancer diagnosis I’ve been more deliberate of who I have around me and who is handling my care and I’m so glad I took the time to find the right OBGYN. Idk if I have the courage to ever be pregnant one day due to the trauma of seeing my mother and other family members suffer horrific pregnancies but for once in my life I feel safe with an OBGYN enough to have that discussion in the future."

"I honestly love this so much for you OP! When I had my first pelvic at 17 after my mom learned I was sexually active.  I remember expressing some discomfort at the speculum and the old crusty white woman gynecologist  just saying “you will be fine, this is smaller than the size of most penises”😑

I have a very similar issue as you and have avoided pelvic exams because I’m terrified of them and the pain I’m anticipating, and I’m in my late 20s. It does feel embarrassing to admit but I know I need to get one done for my own health. I hope I can be as lucky as you to find the right gyno who won’t be dismissive. The last gyno I went to kept acting like I was lying when I told her I was still a virgin and I was about 25/26 at the time and she made me uncomfortable.

My first OBGYN was an older white woman that was also so dismissive of my pain. My second one was Indian she wasn’t dismissive but she was kind of stern and didn’t do much to mitigate the pain. My current OBgYN is in charge of the clerkship for OBgYN rounds at cooper medical school and she’s passionate about making sure every future doctor knows how to do a a pain free pelvic exam.

I’m 19. I was telling my dad about how I got hit on by a 24 year old grad student at a party last fall while I was still 18, and that I thought it was really weird because I wasn’t even done with my first semester of undergrad (and I looked the part too) while he was a whole graduate student. My dad said that it’s not weird as long as I like him, but I think being in such different phases in life makes it a little bit gross. I can understand a 6 year age gap after I’m 25 or something, but I feel like I’m too young to be dating people in their mid 20s right now. Is this an older generation thing? My dad is a gen X bm.	playsmash5	post	12.709341972790632	female	White	0.9886720180511475	na	na	na	32	blackladies
I do think it’s a generational thing. A lot of gen X’ers (not all) don’t seem to find any issues with age gap relationships with people who are fresh out of high school. Trust your instincts because guys who are in their 20’s and older who date adult teens know exactly what they’re doing. I was in a similar position when I was 18 as a college freshman and I dated a 5th year senior. He was in his early 20’s but even that was still a big enough gap. I was very naive at that age (as are most people) and he knew that which is why he went for me. I am 24 now and the thought of dating someone who isn’t even old enough to legally buy alcohol is icky. You’re not crazy for feeling the way that you feel, you are listening to your conscience. If the thought of dating someone makes you uncomfortable or queasy, then they are not right for you. There is a difference between feeling butterflies and feeling anxious.	playsmash5	reply	na	na	na	0.9886720180511475	weak	strong	no	na	blackladies

Keep in mind your father has different priorities. He's looking for a replacement for himself. Someone to protect and provide.

"I would like to applaud you on having the wisdom and discernment to be able to tell that this person is not in the same life stage as you. I did a and BBS which is a six year bachelors degree and even during that degree when you are in your fifth or sixth year it is very unlikely that you would date a first year because of the massive difference in worldview. 

if he’s looking to be serious he should definitely be looking for someone who’s closer to his age and his life stage, if he’s looking to play around it would be unethical to play with someone who  is not looking at things from the same angle. Either way good for you, you dodged a bullet.

"18 and 19 are still teenagers. Bit predatory... Biologically, you aren't really an adult till 25. Brain hasn't finished developing. Not to mention the lack of experience. It takes time to gain wisdom. It takes time to live life and to find out who you really are. That's something we are always figuring out. 

 When we socialize with younger folk it's up to the older folk to recognize boundaries because we've had more time to navigate those boundaries....and yes the older generations ignored those boundaries and often promoted such predatory relationships. Promoted in the form of media....

Nope. I’m 20 and wouldn’t date a 25 year old. I’m so different than I was at 16 and I bet I would be so different at 25 too. People shouldn’t just date others just because they’re legal.	playsmash5	reply	na	na	na	0.9886720180511475	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
I couldn’t date someone who’s in a different place in life from me so I wouldn’t have ever considered it (that and I don’t go more than 3 years for age gaps). Older generations seem to have no problem with large age gaps.	playsmash5	reply	na	na	na	0.9886720180511475	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

You are absolutely right in your assessment: the age gap is gross at this specific age because 24 knows enough to take advantage of 19, it'd be so easy to gaslight you and control you until your brain is fully developed at 24.

Not sure why people are downvoting you - you're just stating a fact. I also ended up with some older guys briefly in my college years.

"This, I think it's more about life stage than the gap itself. 30 and 35/36 have a lot more in common Id think then 18 and 24. 

Also OP there's a weird subset of men, especially 20s-30s men that are like, obsessed with women 18-22. These are the same guys who think ""25 is hitting the wall"" and crap like that. They are often immature and want someone they can manipulate and also who will overlook their stunted growth because of their age. 

Source:  Dated a guy like this and he was telling me at 24 I was too old. He wanted a girl straight out of college ""because they're easier."" He was almost 30.

Aside from that it might also have to do with how your parents/family perceive you. I was parentified so I've been getting ""you're so mature"" since like 10 years old, which isn't healthy in and of itself. My millennial sister pushes me constantly about dating and says that I ""just need someone more mature like 5 years older"" to match me. But with no dating experience, someone 5 years older is more likely to be bad news and you can't read the red flags. That's part of how I ended up in that predatory relationship.

Not saying all guys older are like this ofc, but just be wary and know and stick to your boundaries. It sounds like you're already getting there!"	playsmash5	reply	na	na	na	0.9886720180511475	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

I will say the biggest thing that helped me cope with loneliness is just being okay with being alone. I think there is a lot of pressure to find a partner or to be coupled with someone.

"Hi Coilz! I was going to reply a couple of statements ago but several comments regarding hobbies came up and I wanted to respond here.

The ONLY time I feel the loss of a mate is when I see other people who look happy together. But then when I think of the past examples of guys who were interested in ME and I check the feeling. 

But on developing hobbies ... yes, find something you enjoy doing and then immerse yourself in it. But also don't limit yourself to stereotypes or trends or whatever others think is or isn't ""in"" or ""cool"" or ""black"". I've had relationships and right now, I feel that having a man in my life would STEAL time from all of the things I want to do and love to do. I keep wishing I had 12 or more hours a day to do them all in. I don't have nearly enough time for my passions. 

Yes, I've already had kids and they have kids. I don't regret them, but had I focused more on ME back then rather than on pleasing other people I might have had a more satisfying career in my chosen field and wouldn't be struggling now. I may or may not have had them. I love them, but I guess in most cases it takes growing older and watching your kids move into their OWN lives to realize that all we really are and have is ourselves to ""please"". A lot of women my age have nothing but television, spending money on grandkids, social media or doctors appointments. They are scared of technology and in many cases haven't interacted much more than whatever their family structures ""allowed/encouraged"". 

I homeschooled, so I was lucky ... I embraced technology as a young adult and keep adding to my addiction. Graphic design, web design, digital art, publishing, fashion ... And that is just touching on one aspect. I'm an artist and love it. 

Find a bunch of things to be passionate about and then watch the guys be pissed off that you don't have time (or inclination) for their ""crumbs"" of attention (sex). And having a more well rounded, healthy self esteem means you choose if and when you deal with someone else without feeling like you are missing something. 

Hey, I'll be 62 this year. I have to have learned something in all that time. And in case any of you think ""she's old, probably not attractive any more"" ... nope, have exercise equipment at home, work out, eat healthy, told I look 40, get hit on by 30-40 y/o's (ewwww), dress sharply, size 4, and not ""stupid/bimbo"". Last guy I was involved with was about 5-6 years ago when I realized he wasn't worth it ... We have to totally love ourselves and then we will be less likely to fall for their tricks to convince us we're nothing without them.

I suffer from mental health issues and I also have a problem with styling my wash and gos so my hair has been messy for the past 3 days. However my mother just screamed at me saying that because I live in her house my hair has to be done. The only style my family accepts are weaves, braids, or straightened hair. I prefer my hair natural so whenever I have down days you can forget it with me. However because I live in her house she made it some rule that my hair can’t be undone. Even if I have depression and can’t get to it. I’m tired of looking good sometimes and would like a break from worrying about my appearance. But I’m not allowed to or else she would say she’s gonna kick me out. Today my hair hasn’t been done since I washed it because I don’t know what to put I my hair. Nothing works. When I told her that she said I was making excuses and starting saying “she don’t roll like that” meaning because of my appearance she don’t want me around her house. When I told her about my hair texture she replied saying “that’s some ol nappy shit”! It’s not fair. Men get to go around with messy hair. Non black women get to go around with messy hair. Whenever I explain this to her she goes and says I need to stop talking about race.	crazygurl3	post	14.9588691976047	female	White	0.9992013573646545	na	na	na	11	blackladies
"You know…. The smart ass side of me would be like “Yeah this nappy shit came from you, mom” and I would’ve dated her to kick me out over some fucking hair. Or at the very least ask her “And what are you gonna do about it?” bc I feel like she’s just bullying you and kicking you when she knows you’re down right now and it’s all empty threats.

However, I’m sure you’re not looking to be homeless on the off chance she takes on you on that offer.

Another option could be to just ignore her and do what’s called “Greg rocking” where you don’t say anything past “uh huh” and “okay” to her nasty comments. It’s so rude and uncalled for and I’m sorry she’s acting like this. Perhaps that’s you’re queue to start looking at other living options if she’s going to be an asshole over nothing. 

As a side note, she also reminds me of Sanaa Pathan’s mom in the movie “Something New.” Her mom literally says “Your hair! Your hair was your glory!” when she shows up natural to an event.

My dad is paralyzed physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. Unfortunately... and God hasn't told me to walk away yet. He has told me that I do need to put up boundaries and remember that it's not my job to save him. He actually put that on my spirit last night. That in itself helped me with some perspective and will help me get less angry. I can walk away in the moment, just not in the assignment if you know what I mean. And so yes, when my dad decides to act up with his mouth, I'll just walk away instead of letting him get any other emotions out of me. I'm sorry your parents also have comments about your hair too.

Just a quick rant I’m 5’2 petite/slim I have a nice butt it can use some improvements with some squats lol, small boobs (which I come to actually be fine with as I got older) but I have no hips or very little hips sometimes it appears that I have a little something going on but that may thigh thing idk. I know there are not serious issues just want to know  can anyone else relate. I’m a little self conscious about it  I don’t like my pants to fit to tight around that area because I feel like it brings attention to them. I’m trying to learn to accept it ( I don’t think there going to grow/widen) and just focus on working out/ eating healthier and becoming my own body goals, but I’m not going to lie I really wish I had some I actually like being petite I just wish I had a little somethin somethin lol😩.

"Hey! 

I've been talking to this non poc guy for some time and I think it just dawned on me that I could be being fetishized...

When we first started talking a few months back, I asked him what he's into in a sexual sense and he said he's into cute black girls and doing other normal stuff, but still now that I think about it, why did he mention race? 

Then at some point, he complimented my dark nipples which I thought was normal, but I looked at a subreddit post about fetishization and some black women detailed how men that fetishized them talked about their dark nipples. 

About a month into talking, he said: ""I bet you can make it clap"".  I didn't think anything of it cuz I was a naive 18-year-old, but lol now that I think about it...it's kinda weird. Like if he likes twerking sure, but to say I bet you can make it clap is weird, especially since we started texting and he hadn't seen my ass yet lol. 

Another thing that I think is a bit fetishy is bringing up my skin the majority of the time whenever he compliments me. He says stuff like: ""beautiful black skin"" or ""mahogany skin"". 

I really like this guy and we've been talking long enough-a year or so-for us to actually like each other, but lol this is really stressing me out. 

Do you think this is fetishization? "	Suspicious_Pool72	post	21.042116831515177	female	White	0.997259259223938	na	na	na	94	blackladies

"Yeah, he's fetishizing you.

The way to recognize if it's happening is to ask yourself if someone likes you for who you are or because of some physical aspect. The fact that he makes comments like ""I bet you can make it clap,"" means he's not seeing you as a human being, but as a stereotype. He won't see you for the person you are, just the object of his fetish.

"Most definitely. And that sucks yall this far into it. But hey, now ya know. 

Perspective: 
I'm an agender white male. My last relationship was interracial. We thought each other was beautiful in every way. But not once had either of us commented on skin tone when sharing our appreciation for one another's bodies. Whack. 

Also, if you are ever unsure, just substitute skin tone with feet. 😆 If you take those same situations and make em bout feet and it start sounding like they could have a foot fetish, well, now you know. All they seeing is your feet, or in this case your skin, and don't really See You. 

Jokes aside, their remarks shouldn't be all that different from any other healthy relationship. If it's genuine wholesome appreciation then it shouldn't Feel different than any other wholesome expression of beauty.

"Honestly, it could be, but it could just be white knighting also. I.e. maybe he's trying to ""build you up"" and he's really clumsy about it. You didn't mention his age, but if he's around 18 he is almost certainly awkward as hell (and if he ain't you better run, trust me on that one). 

Now, him being awkward doesn't mean he's *not* fetishizing you. No law against being both awkward and an asshole. But what you gave us here isn't enough to conclude either way.   
What I would suggest is involving a mature, experienced adult; like a professional couples' therapist or something, if that's an option. Someone who actually knows what they're talking about, not randos on the internet who usually speak most when they know least. Fuck, anyone with a successful long-term relationship might do the job, in my experience. 

Get help like that to teach you both how to have mature and open conversations, or at least to teach you how to recognize a slimebag if that's the case, and get at it. There's no shortcuts in real life, unfortunately. You have to grow up and talk.

"Well, in this case white knighting would be something like him trying to rescue you from something he thinks you need rescuing from, without bothering to ask you what you think/feel about it. Such as, to answer the second question also, thinking you might have issues with your confidence and self-image.   
Which I figured he might be, just based on some experiences I've had with otherwise well intentioned (usually white) people trying to not be racist with POC. You know, they read an article about the racist history of beauty standards and then they try to ""fix"" it with every POC they see. Their hearts are usually in the right place, but their actions may be more hurtful than doing nothing. At least that was my experience running around with some anti-racist crowds back in the day. Eager to help, but sometimes too eager to manage to actually listen.

"I ask because I recently visited a new doctor(white) and her nurse(black) left a bad taste in my mouth during our short interaction. First off instead of trying to say my name she just called out to the waiting room for ""the lady"" to come up. Now my name isn't ""lady"" so I was confused as to what's going on and thought she couldn't be talking about me but sure enough she was. Then later on when she was doing preliminary intake stuff she was very curt which I didn't care too much about until she was being very pushy, rude, and tactless about asking if I was depressed. It was honestly just weird and I know I was looking at her like wtf so she curtly responded ""it's just a page I have to get through"" before leaving. I had a friend with me and after the nurse left they were also kinda baffled by how weird she was. Later on when I saw the doctor she also asked about depression but she did it in such a kind and compassionate way that it made the nurses questioning seem even worse. For the record I'm **not** planning to make a fuss over this because everyone has off days but it got me wondering what I'd do if my future interactions with this nurse became worse. 

So that brings me to my question: what do you all do when you have an issue with another black woman in a professional setting?"	rouxedcadaver	post	26.861925393629594	male	White	0.9991275668144226	na	na	na	17	blackladies
"You have to do something super shitty to me for me to personally tell management. You can be curt and have an attitude, but that *to me* doesn’t warrant you not being able to support yourself financially.

Honestly it depends on the setting…I think a medical setting is one I’d probably say something about though. There are already so many barriers to care for some people, one bad nurse experience could turn off someone who really needed to be there.

"It broke my heart to have to lead the way to fire a black woman who was working from home in a different state. I was training her on my old job and she had the job for 6 months and still couldn't do it. In fact I won't even say she couldn't do it but when you're working in accounting it's easy to know when someone's working because the accounting software is something that has an audit function. It literally time stamps everything that you do. So if your job is 90% in the system and you can go days without being in the system what was I supposed to do. First of all I couldn't even do my new job because I still have one foot in the old job. And took months to fire her because we went through every single step trying to keep her. I really liked her too and she was so smart and had a degree in accounting which I don't even have. But whatever issue she had she did not want to divulge which is her right.

Yes, I hesitate and give other black women at least two chances more than I would give anybody else. I have to remind myself to give myself grace but with other black women it comes naturally.

"I [24F] have started a new job at a law firm, something which I’ve been ecstatic about. 

The firm hired 3 people in my role, and I was the first one to join by a week. I loved the work, I smashed targets from the get go and it was acknowledged by my manager that I had performed exceptionally well for a new starter. 

Fast forward a week, the next person joins the role. She’s white and face of the firm worthy, for lack of a better description. I’m not sure if race is the reason, but she joined and it was as if I had become invisible.

She sits right next to me, and we have a statistic table on our database which our department can see. She didn’t hit nearly as many targets in a week as I did, she struggled with a lot of the work and was quite slow with dealing with clients. However, she was getting so much positive attention from our supervisor which I compared to myself getting nothing. 

The new joiner and I went through firm official training together, and both of us were sitting either side of the person training us. The person training us did not turn in my direction for about 95% of the session, only asked for her name and otherwise treated me as if I were a ghost. I was sitting there trying to engage and ask questions, I was well presented, I was polite, and yet I was thinking there reflecting on the fact that I was up early that morning ironing my shirt just for nobody to even look at me. 

Other members of the firm address us both but only talk to her, only wait for her answer etc. and it’s little things like this which I can’t help but notice. 

Lately it’s been depressing going to work, whereas I was so happy to start only a couple of weeks ago. I’ve spent most of my life working twice as hard just to be seen and now it’s as if it’s still the same case but in a different form. 

Am I overthinking it?"	987654throwaway123	post	26.87336185923507	female	White	0.9987775683403015	na	na	na	9	blackladies

"This is our reality a lot of the time. I exist in a lot of different professional spaces, but have been used to this since childhood. I ultimately cope by operating for my own sense of integrity and definition of rightness. As long as I am behaving in ways that fill me and am producing products and service and ways of being I stand behind for myself, and not for others’ recognition or whatever - not saying you’re doing that - I am happy. Once I learn what the situation is, I accept as a given that they have a twisted sense of reality, equity, and justice that does not apply in any meaningful way to my life. Thus, as long as I am doing the job and putting forth the excellent work that I do (for myself), it doesn’t matter what they do or don’t have to say or what they think of me because I know it’s coming from their weird, twisted place. It’s interesting as fodder or information about how to “be successful” in white spaces, but it doesn’t actually have a bearing on who I know I am and what I’m capable of. 

If people w more power than me have feedback about the work I’m doing, they can let me know and I will apply it in a way that I can stay true to myself. And if I can’t stay true to myself, as in whatever they want is not the choice I would make on my own accord, I can provide my own feedback if I want to and otherwise recognize that it is their choice to make and go forth. 

Plus, you’re there because they wanted you to be there, they needed you. They still do. They recognize your skill and potential to contribute meaningfully to their work. And you were excited because you know your skill and potential too. That will only grow as you continue to operate with integrity despite and because of them. Wishing you a work buddy you can trust enough to have a little bit of tension relief and validation that your reality is the more accurate, just one. 💪🏿 And when your coworker starts asking you for help in ways that would take up more time than you want, keep being nice, but tell her you’re not really sure either lol."	987654throwaway123	reply	na	na	na	0.9987775683403015	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

I’m almost always mentioned last when they send both of us an email. Sure, it’s not a big deal, it’s just an email but it still doesn’t feel good.

"Black women are ignored from the time they are girls. This has been shown in studies time after time. There was a study that showed teachers paying extra attention to black boys because they’re always “up to something” while the white children with the same behavior get a pass. This habit was found in white AND BLACK teachers. 

Everyone just expects us to take care of ourselves and often times we do. It gets to the point where even when we do well, it’s always, “of course you’re doing well”. “It’s so nice I don’t have to worry about you.” While these are good attributes, it often leads to us being ignored when it comes time for recognition, etc while our white peers can do no wrong. They get chance after chance to fuck up. When it comes time for special projects with high visibility, we’re not chosen. At this point when people are confused as to why the I’m overlooked, I tell people point blank that the manger picked who they were most comfortable working with.

"Sorry if this post is all over the place. I'm a girl in my early 20s. I have a yt bf who I've been with for 5 years. I've been living with him and his family for about 3 years because my mother is abusive and I couldn't live with her anymore. His family has done a lot for me, and pretty much helped me become a functional adult (credit, license, job, life skills etc.) So this is really difficult for me. But I feel alone and like I'm losing my mind and I don't know if it's justified or if it's my anxiety/depression.

A bit of backstory.

I love my mom but I've had to learn to love her from a distance. She's been distant and self absorbed my entire life. When it comes to me there's a jealousy, projection, and half assesedness that comes with her parenting. I feel like she blames me as the first born for how her life turned out and growing up I was definitely the scapegoat of me and my siblings. A few examples: She always found a way to rope me into/blame me regarding arguments with my sisters. She repeatedly called me selfish and shit talked me to the whole family for 3 years, for ONE time, I didn't give her money (despite making up for it many times over) She's jealous that I have a boyfriend and downplays our relationship, belittles me for being in a serious relationship, and called me a whore any chance she got. Repeatedly calls me lazy when I don't do what she wants and always gives me bad (almost seemingly intentionally sabotaging) advice. And so much more.

 She was never interested in my life and never even bothered to contact me even after I moved out until recently. She just shit talked me to my grandma while my grandma peer pressured me to taking to her bc ""she's my mom"". Even now when she reaches out to me it's less about wanting to check on me and more about needing something or feeling lonely. My mom is better now but I feel like that's only because I don't need her and I don't think I would be able to rely on her for anything because she would use it against me.

Now on to my boyfriends family. They were great for a few years and then things started going downhill, particularly with his mother. I've always seen her as someone who I could go to and who would be there for me but then I had started to notice jealous/possessive behavior. For example, she would make snide comments when my boyfriend would do things for me saying stuff like ""She can do that herself"" and also accused me of trying to ""take her baby away from her"" when we visited my family and my bf liked the area.

When I asked her about these things, it got really ugly. She denied everything and then would do a 180 and be like ""why would that bother you"" and ""I wouldn't say that to your face"". She acted confused, hurt, and flustered despite me being very clear, calm, and straight to the point. She tried to turn my boyfriend against me and victimized herself, fake crying, and saying that I hurt her, pulling reasons out of her ass (that weren't even about her but rather things between my bf and I as if that somehow affects her). She tried to use me talking to her about racism in the country as an example of how I was rude to her but didn't even finish the sentence and expected me to fill on the blanks. I 100% believe she only brought that up because she couldn't think of anything else and was trying to get me heated so that her victimness would be justified. I specificly stayed calm throughout the entire conversation so that I wouldn't be blamed for how she acted and I still partially was. And she would get mad when no one else denied that she said those things or when my bf would take anything I said into consideration.

Eventually she ran out crying and my bf chased after where she was manipulative trying to convince her children that I was spreading lies about her (and getting angry when they didn't believe her) and telling my bf how she ""cant say what she wants in her own house"" . We almost broke up after that, which I'll explain if asked bc long post. Ever since, shes acted nice to me which made me think we were ok but then would do or say some trifling shit that makes me think it's all fake. I feel like she's nice to me not because she actually likes me but because if she's not she might ""lose"" her son. 

Moving on she has this possessive fantasy of all her kids living on the same lot as her where I was called selfish and villanzed for daring to have any preferences on where I wanted to live. (All I asked for was to live somewhere with black people, where I could safely have a child, and to be by family btw) I decided I wasn't doing that shit anymore.

Other than his mothers actions, his family has been relatively nice but don't really acknowledge my blackness at all so I don't really feel like I could fully be myself because they'll be so quick to get offended wanting things to be ""fair"". I feel like I have to tone down my love of certain things that might be stereotypical so that they don't make certain ""jokes"". Or not wear my hair a certain way so they don't comment on my hair. Overall I can't be fully comfortable with them.

All that being said with A LOT of details left out for time, I feel overwhelmed and alone. I can't rely on my mother so can't go back to her house. I can't get over how his mother acted towards me and don't feel comfortable basing my entire future on my relationship with his family. I don't know if it's my anxiety that makes me still upset about everything that's happened or if I'm just being for lack of better terms gaslit into getting over it like it wasn't that bad. I just tired of everybody and feel like I can't trust anybody. Im starting therapy in a month but just needed to rant I guess and maybe get some advice. I'm planning on moving out and just being by myself but I'm not in financial position to do so yet."	Tea-lover46	post	14.815148972909862	female	White	0.9965373277664185	na	na	na	5	blackladies

"Phew. That’s a lot. First question, where is your boyfriend in all of this? You talked about your family and his family, but how do you feel about him and your future? How does he feel about you? The situation? 

For ease, Im going to presume that you do like him and want to continue pursuing a future with him. I think it’s v positive you’re moving out and that you’re starting therapy soon! You’ll be able to see the actual viability of your relationship and your desires for it and yourself (!) without the weight of needing him and his family to help take care of you. Also I wouldn’t call you paranoid. She’s said and done things that have made clear that you’re no longer welcome. That’s not some kind of unfounded worry, that’s the reality of the situation.  

Regarding the mom, there’s a reason for the mother-in-law/femme partner to male son disdain tropes. There’s a lot of unhealthy enmeshment in some families where moms truly believe that their son is all they have and  they’ll be alone/won’t be able to function without him etc. They see women in the son’s life as competition for the son’s time, love, and care that they feel like they alone deserve. And they might do weird stuff to sort of make the son choose between them. And in reality the mom and women are in competition for the son in the sense that things like time are finite, but in a healthy relationship, all parents know that true children have to grow up and they want them to! And they are confident in the love they have. Altho its the parents responsibility to let their child go and wish them well, its also the child’s responsibility to stand up to the parent and let them know with their words and actions that they’ll always love them AND they are prioritizing the other woman in their life. I think relationships can survive and even thrive, albeit perhaps a little sadly if family relationships are strained despite desiring them, but only if the son can establish healthy boundaries with the mom in ways that are sustainable for he and the partner. But if he keeps choosing the mom to the harm of the partner, things are doomed for the couple and the mom and son can stay together forever, just as the mom wanted.

I'd like to still be with my boyfriend. I do love him, (and I love his mom too so this all hurts a lot) but I'm tired of his moms bullshit and I would be less likely to accept his excuses for her behavior. If I had to end our relationship, living situation aside, I can't handle breaking up with my boyfriend and uprooting my life all at once. I have no friends I can live with, so Ive just been trying to get my shit together so I can move out and then deal with the relationship afterwards, whatever happens.

I promise you nobody cares about your knees. Of all the places people are going to be looking it’s not there. Because we have melanin, you can expect the skin on any major joint (elbows, knees) to be darker than the rest of your body. As long as there is friction, this is likely to happen. Unless you want to immobilize yourself in a cast for the rest of your life you can’t stop it from happening. All of those skin whiteners and chemicals just brighten the skin, that will eventually darken again in time.

"Do you feel like we as black people are uneducated about STD’s?

I m gonna try to make this as short as possible. 
I live in a small city where It’s very messy and negative. Every other few months they have a “STD List” where they expose people who have herpes, chlamydia, etc. There was even a girl who trusted a friend to stay the night at her house and the friend took a photo of a prescription and posted it online on an anonymous page. These STD rumors have ruined so many peoples reputation. They’re called nasty, promiscuous, etc when most of the time It isn’t even there fault. They caught it because their partner cheated or got it as a child. 

Unfortunately, I’m caught in the mix. I recently contracted chlamydia from a guy I trusted. So I went to get a full STD panel, there may be a high chance I have herpes too. I’m just scared I may end up on the list, be judged, lose friends, etc because the stigma is so horrible. How will I live with this if it happens?

I’d definitely look into subreddits for people with herpes for support. Herpes is one of the most common STDs and people live very normal dating and sex lives with it.

I really do feel like people are clueless when it comes to STD's. I remember once when I went to get tested, they draw from several people in a room at the same time. (The HIV rapid test is done 1:1 with a medical professional) The phlebotomists looked intellectually exhausted and then it came out what happened with someone who was in the room before I got there. 


The phlebotomist started prepping a patient and he asked her why does she need to draw blood, ""I don't have HIV, why do you need to test me?"" she explained to him, ""Well we are testing you for STD's so we need to draw your blood."" He insisted that he couldn't have any STD's since his HIV rapid said he was negative. She then explained to him there are other STD's he needs to be tested for. Again, he said, ""But I'm negative for HIV.""

Like he really thought if he was HIV negative he either couldn't have or didn't have an STD. 

It's a shame because there's so much free information and free testing out there that people really don't know. Google is on every phone, and somehow...

It’s not that we aren’t educated about STDs as information about them and how to prevent them is all around us.   We know the advantages/benefits of using condoms/dental dams, but so many of us don’t use them.  One major reason we don’t use protective devices like we know we should is that we tend to let ourselves be persuaded by our partners to have sex without a condom because doing so feels “better”.   And, yes, it does “feel better” without devices but with so much that can be contracted through sex, we must take control of our own sexual health by demanding that condoms,etc are used(whether provided by you or him)during all sex or refuse to have sex.

"Higher rates are not necessarily indicative of a lack of education—you mentioned “less access to medical care”, that alone is a huge confounder in STI rates in all communities. I don’t think it’s fair, nor is it backed by data to say we have “higher rates of STIs” (which ones?) *because* of a “lack of education.”

STI rates have increased across races and that is mostly due to a cultural shift (changed attitudes, even with abysmal understanding of preventative behaviors across the board) of there being less concern about STIs as the public health initiative of “Safe Sex” worked fairly well…perhaps too well, we now to counterbalance."

"Ok this adds much needed context so thank you!

I do not think on average Black folk are uneducated about STIs, I do think, however, that people younger than 32~ tend to be more open to risky behavior (no condoms or birth control, multiple partners, partners you do not know well or at all, etc.) and tend to have a more relaxed outlook on STIs (data supports this, check your local health department or CDC for some insight on STI rates and other interesting research).

Overall, this behavior (the list, the outing, etc) is incredibly young. I want you to know people don’t usually act like this outside of where you’re currently residing—don’t get me wrong, folks love gossip but what you described is rather organized…Regardless, it sounds easy and I know it’s not but just wait for your test results. I pray you don’t have herpes but it is of note many people living with herpes live perfectly normal lives as it can be managed well with medication.

What I am saying is you can’t say that higher rates are *indicative* of a lack of education because there’s so much more that goes into it and saying it’s just a “lack of education” is a bit reductive.

Yes of course multiple things contribute to this. I’m not saying education is the only thing that explains the disparities.. But I was just answering OPs question lol. And I think lack of education does contributes a lot to disparities . For example.. It’s crazy how many women I have to convince to get a Pap smear. Some don’t even know why it’s important or what the process is… so again if you don’t go to the doctor for preventative health, you’ll go a long time without knowing a diagnosis until it starts causing problems..

"Right and I’m not arguing with you but I need to drive this point home: going to the doctor or getting a pap also isn’t about education either right? It’s about access to that care and, for Black folks for example, cultural apprehension/distrust in doctors. You could have the most educated person but if they don’t trust the medical system or have access to it, education doesn’t do much. Same as if I could be incredibly educated about safe sex but if the group I mostly have access to for sexual encounters are a group who may not desire use of condoms (this is actually high in Hispanic communities as research shows), I’m either gonna: (a) not have sex (a decision that for a lot of people only lasts so long); (b) have the unprotected sex; (c) have a constant debate whenever initiating sex, resulting in mixed results; or (d) go elsewhere for sex (which isn’t always possible or useful since most people date within their race and physically moving isn’t always feasible, anyway).

You cannot (always) educate someone out of disparities that predispose people to certain things, especially if those disparities combine or encode behavior into their (cultural/ethnic/racial/geographic/etc) group. Education is not always a cure all when it comes to things like this which is why public health work/programming/messaging is so important."

No. Hell no. If he asks me out, he should expect to pay. Men who try this Dutch shit on the first date have always turned out to be cheap and stingy, in my experience. He doesn’t have to be an ATM but he has to be a gentleman and a real gentleman would be offended at the thought of letting a woman pay for the first date that HE asked her out on.

"Some odd takes here…most of which I disagree with. 

We’re all adults. If another adult asks you out…why isn’t the expectation that each adult pays for their own meal? Whether or not someone is generous or “marriage material” doesn’t come across from their willingness to pay for a stranger’s steak. These are qualities you learn about over time. 

I’m also in favor of paying for myself because I want to be able to order whatever the hell I want without feeling any way about it. I want prime rib? Done. Soufflé? Yes, please. Bottle of wine? I don’t mind if I do.

Nah. I’m good. He sounds like: 1) he’s here to waste time 2) if he were financially secure, he wouldn’t care about spending money on a date, and not that he has to spend a lot of money either. To me, if he is planning to take a woman out on a true date, he knows that there are 2 outcomes: 1) the date goes well and we see each other again or 2) the date didn’t go as planned, he spent a bit of money that shouldn’t make or break his pockets and that’s end of that.

"I'm not up for it. I consider dating, especially early dates, an audition for marriage and I always wanted to be married with kids. In fact, I am currently married with kids and I've found that when dating it's very important to find men that are (1) generous, (2) serious about dating, and (3) employed. A man offering to pay to for a date signals these very important characteristics. 

There is nothing less equal in this life than having children. The burden on women is immense and I find that men that have this ""tit for tat"" or ""cheap"" mindset in dating do not value the sacrifices a woman makes when she uses her body to create life and subsequently takes a hit to her career to breastfeed and recover afterwards. 

Also, in my opinion, a good way to weed out the men seeing a crap-ton of other women is to expect him to pay the bill. It's hard to afford to foot the bill if he's seeing 10+ other chicks. It also shows that their serious about you and trying to impress you. 

In my opinion, this trend of ""dutch dating"" is just men trying to lower the bar even further. Let me ask, what are your thoughts on showing up to a date in a brown paper bag and a potato sack? Can I suggest dressing like this to see if a man ""likes me for me""? Just like men don't want to be viewed as ATMs, I don't want to be viewed as a sexual object and I want them to like me for my personality. 

No? No, of course not, because sexual attraction matters and men have to see our private parts, but we have to act like we don't care about money (you know, the thing that dictates everything from where you sleep to what you eat)."

Window shop downtown. Get a coffee. Browse a used book store. Go to the farmer's market. If you invite someone somewhere, you should be paying. That's just hospitality.

"Hard no from me. Don’t get me wrong, I can pay for my own meal many times over, but if a man asks me out on a date, plans the date, chooses the restaurant and the time, why am I paying anything? I had no equity in the planning - why do I suddenly have it when the bill comes?

But the real reason is I have no interest in dating a man from the manosphere. Those broke loser misogynistic men with no real life direction, or some who are just cheap and stingy. I’d rather be single. 

Men are simple. When they really want something or someone, they don’t play games like this. They don’t want to risk it.

I once dated a sweet guy who pulled himself out of homelessness and built his own business. It was a struggling business when we met but still a business. So he didn’t have a lot of money. He would not hear of going Dutch, even though I offered because I didn’t want to be a burden. He’s the ONE guy I ever considered that for because I knew by then he had a good heart. He refused. Hard refusal. I was almost mad with myself for suggesting it - he was almost offended.

Also - my platonic male friends don’t even let me pay. Why would I go out with a man who wants me to? There are alternatives to spending a ton of money.

The men I dated Dutch (also happened to be Black men) seemed to have bought into this “golddigger” type mindset that I don’t fully understand.

"That’s fair. 

My experience was different when I was single and dating, however. 

I used to like to get the expectation of who was going to pay out of the way so I could focus on getting to know the individual I agreed to spend time with. 

‘Wealth’ is a matter of perspective, so I understand people being protective of their money - however large or small the amount is. I know I am; I’ve worked too hard and too long not to be. If a man feels the need to protect his money…I’m not mad at that. He just needs to not be an asshole about it. 

I don’t think anyone should feel ‘secure’ regarding anything on a first date, let alone have any amount of ‘trust’. A first date is basically two strangers getting to know one another; there should be no expectation outside of that. 

I just don’t think someone’s willingness to pay for my meal on a first date is a good metric to use in determining if they’re a good life partner for me. When I was dating, plenty of jerks paid for things and bought me gifts - at the end of the day it doesn’t mean anything."

You’re not entitled to anyone’s money or generosity…especially if it’s just the first date where nothing has been established.

Being selfish is not exclusive to men; it is, however, exclusive to humans. 

I think there are numerous ways to vet a potential partner, but for me, it’s not who pays for what on our first date.

"Hahaha of course sis, some examples:

For example, a lot of Dutch men are convinced that you should go Dutch on the first date (or all the dates). The expression to go Dutch doesn’t come out of thin air. They are known to send you a payment request for the least!!! 

I haven’t experienced this a lot, but there are stories out there of people being invited for a first date for example, but then after the date they get a payment request because their date didn’t want a second date or the one invited said they enjoyed, but wouldn’t want to continue going on dates. 😂😂 of course not all Dutch men are like this, but some stories are WILD!

Another maybe more general thing is that internationally, the Netherlands is seen as a country that is very accepting, they are the first country to legalize gay marriage, but you won’t see that the LGBTQ+ monument in Amsterdam has been desecrated and destroyed many times or that LGBTQ+ are being harassed and even killed in the Netherlands. The same with racism, try to explain to your boyfriend’s family that the Dutch “tradition” of Sinterklaas with Zwarte Piet (Black Pete) is racist - trigger warning: black face and racism.

"Women put more effort financially into their appearance (hair, makeup, outfit, grooming, etc) and their safety (ie self defense classes and weapons, emergency transportation, etc) than men. Without it, women are severely socially penalized or at risk physically. When you break down at least the financial cost of these things, women end up spending more on a date than men.

This doesn’t even require the length women go through emotionally preparing for their dates typically in the form of alerting loved ones of their locations or just being cautious of their environment. It’s honestly more expensive and more emotionally draining for women to date. Even in the most egalitarian relationship, women still bear more of the emotional and logistical burden.

However, I will NEVER go anywhere with any man who asks me to go anywhere and expect for me to pay. I recently had a man in my DM drop me a link to his art show in another state. When I told him I don’t live there,he followed that with “that’s what jets are for “. I then asked him on whose dime, because I clearly wasn’t going to purchase a plane ticket to attend an art show that HE invited me to. His response was “you must be broke”. See how absolutely asinine his way of thinking is? It’s just as asinine as a GROWN MAN asking a woman out and then suggesting she pays. I can pay for my own meal and eat it alone, or go out with one of my female friends at pay for it. I wish I would sit a table with a man who invited me to be there, and pay for anything.

"Because dating is a gamble. Most people are bringing their representatives on the first date so even if a woman agreed to it, she may be doing so to make it seem like “she’s not like other girls.”

But most men take advantage of pick-mes like that. I remember the first talk I had with my step dad about dating/relationships and he said something that always stuck with me: “If he ask you to pay he’s either broke or thinks you’re dumb.”

Men with money who are secure within themselves know what comes with that territory. They weed out people just like anybody else would. If you have high emotional intelligence you shouldn’t need to “test” anybody. Your conversations and their actions should eventually reveal if they’re there for you and not JUST money. But let me clear here - there are a whole lot of men who know they are desired for what they have and don’t mind trickin’.

There are men out there that believe in the Dutch/50-50. While I don’t like it and don’t agree with it, there are women and even people of other cultures that are it and that’s their business and way of life, fine.

But when you have men who are actively trying to test women and put women in the category as materialistic gold diggers, that’s when it becomes a problem.

If these men are so hung up on finding a woman that is more in the Dutch/50-50 dating lifestyle, then they should make it clear up front in the talking stage that that is their expectation and find a woman that aligns with their dating values. But instead they try to be sneaky and play games to “weed out women” when they could have just been up front and respectful about it.

I'm not saying either way is right or wrong (like Techygal9 I'm hella queer, so I have no dog in this fight hah), but I guess I'm not seeing the difference in the way that a lot of women justify testing men via their wallets and men testing women by dangling (or not dangling) their wallets."

Why do you get to make that determination? Seems drastically more toxic to tell strangers (especially ones that aren't looking to date you) that they can't date at all because they disagree with your opinion on who should pay. Your expectations for yourself and your dating life don't apply to everyone else, and if they don't align, I'm sure that person would be happy to lose your number because no one wants to build towards a relationship with major cracks or disagreements appearing after one date.  

I get that you have your own standards and expectations for dating, which is great - everyone should know what they want here and chase it for themselves - but there are 8 billion people on this planet.

100% agreed. It cannot be emphasized enough. The transactional dynamics playing out between men and women are depreciating the dating world. Emotional intelligence, as you mentioned, should be valued higher by women but we settle for the monetary/financial aspects of a man and determine his worth by those standards.

"One of the other responders noted the entire world is transactional and that’s so true. After talking with these women it feels like they have to do these things in an attempt to find a man who hopefully has the emotional intelligence to understand all that women go through by the action of them being willing to pay.

And this is why I’m glad we have these forums to speak to each other give another perspective and teach those who may not know.  The world is transactional it’s not a dirty word it’s life we trade our time for money, we pay more for conveniences so on and so forth. Dating is only exhausting if you don’t have standards and boundaries that you stand firm in “oh he wants a coffee date and I’m a dinner girl” NEXT “can you just come to my house and chill” hmm low effort and unsafe “NEXT”.  In none of those situations will you feel taken advantage of or used because you stayed true to your desires and don’t take it as a personal affront to your character because you lost nothing not even a couple hours of your time.

I never said women testing men isn’t clown behavior but I see no instances of that on this thread. Just women who said if he wants to go Dutch they’re not dating him. That’s not a test, that’s a preference.

You brought him up anecdotally so, he was fair game. I was pointing out that the chances of him meeting women who ALL wanted something from him was low. Men can be short sighted when it comes to attraction. 

And no I don’t always think the worst of them. I wouldn’t have a man if I did. But as soon as a man asks me out and suggests we go Dutch I do. And this coming from someone who is bi-sexual who’s never taken a woman out and asked her to pay for shit.

"“Fair game”? Jesus, some people really are hellbent on just hating men from the jump lmao. No one is “fighting for men’s honor here” - trash men are trash, and there’s no need to pretend like I haven’t said their clown behavior being called out isn’t problematic af. I’m simply saying people need to stop testing people and taking advantage altogether, and some of the comments on this post make it insanely clear that they are doing just that themselves. 

If all men do is ""disparage black women collectively"", why are you dating one? It sounds like you found a great one that works for you and potentially treats you well, but I can say the same for almost every single one of my close friends with male partners. Literally nowhere am I saying trash dudes should be held up (they really, really shouldn't!), but holy crap, it's wild to see the way we've all know some women full on take advantage of dudes in dating being waved away here. Trash behavior is trash behavior. No matter who someone is or who they are dating, stop testing people. Stop taking advantage of others. Stop messing with people's minds, hearts, and wallets.

"Hey y’all, my partner and I have been seeing each other for 5 months and have been officially dating for 2. We have similar interests (we send each other songs we like, enjoy going out to try new restaurants together, etc.) but our tastes differ. This is especially true for movies. He’s really REALLY into horror media to the point that I noticed it as soon as we started spending time together in person. 

Last night he texted me saying there’s a new Exorcist movie coming out in the fall and that he wants us to go see it. This franchise is his favorite, he has shirts, posters, and books all about this one series. I’m excited for him but I’m also dreading having to go. 

A few weeks ago I tried watching a scary movie with him (evil dead rising) and tapped out after 5 minutes (someone got scalped 😭). I feel bad refusing to go since we’ve gone to movies that I like multiple times (Barbie, Spider-Man etc.) and he is obviously really excited to share this with me. A few weeks ago I asked him if he was going to see Insidious (another scary ass movie) and he said no because “he wanted me to go with him” and I was busy that weekend. 

What would y’all do in this situation? Should I ask him to go with his friends or keep my eyes closed for the entire film.

Update: I took y’all’s advice and asked if there’s anything less scary we could watch first. He said he’s down to watch the original one with me but if I can’t take it he’ll go alone or with some friends.

"My partner is also a horror movie fanatic, while I have nightmares about certain scenes from Harry Potter. I’m very bad with scary movies. For some I’ll tough it out for the story (mainly Jordan Peele stuff). But for the most part it’s an absolute no for scary movies. 

My partner never tries to force them on me and I don’t try to suffer through them just because it’s something they like. They wouldn’t want me to either because it’s something that causes me stress, so me doing it for them isn’t really enjoyable for them. 

I love trashy reality tv. They get second hand embarrassment easily to the point of getting sick and it’s unbearable for them to watch. So I never ask them to and I couldn’t imagine being okay with them suffering like that just for quality time. 

But I’m also very anti “two become one” type of relationships. You guys don’t have to bond over every interest.

So just be transparent, in how much you can’t take some images. If you’re gonna keep your eyes closed or whatever give him a heads up so he knows you are just there for him, and aren’t gonna engage with the movie. talk about if you need to step out or get away how you two will handle it before hand.

"Helloo. I rarely post on here and this topic is something I figure I could share here.

I’m stuck between dropping out of college or staying. I’m an illustration major and I commute downtown to school. For 3 years I’ve been going through rounds of depression, anxiety, mental breakdowns, and stress at home. I really don’t like being home. In 2020 I had the worst mental health in my life, and it wasn’t due to COVID, rather that I had to stay home with my folks because of lockdown. After that ordeal, I’ve hated being here ever since, and have been trying to find ways to move out.

And now, that stress has bled into my ability to focus on college. Not only that, but I’ve lost my passion for art. I haven’t drawn a thing (for myself) since last year, only assignments. Before then, I was always drawing, even with all the stress. Still though, I’ve always said I probably wouldn’t draw as a full time career, probably just on the side. So for those reasons, I seriously have considered dropping out. I cannot go to college and work for like 3 days a week and afford to live downtown. It’s not realistic. All my financial aid is being used for academic reasons, so I’m able to go to school and not pay out of pocket. No one has the money to pay for it either. I could take out a loan but im already in debt…I’m not so sure about that option. I threatened family that If I do not get on campus, I will not continue school. I refuse to have to get on the train crying, not being able to focus in class because I’m distressed, or not being able to go out and explore my college because my folks are too much of crybabies to let my grown ass do anything. I’ve done it for two years and I’m over it. So I was looking into a 3 month program that’ll help me get straight into dentistry and into my own place if this doesn’t happen for me. 

My step mother is trying to help me and my Dad is extremely against me dropping out. My grandparents whom I live with don’t even know what’s going on. But I can’t make any promises if I’m not on campus by the time school starts. I shouldn’t have to be stressed in school. Not to mention I’m paying for a major I’m not even interested in anymore that technically does not require a degree. 

So if anyone has any resources and recommendations, that’d be a huge help.🤎"	Sad-Ad-4200	post	31.037430345062266	female	White	0.9980654120445251	na	na	na	9	blackladies

Hey, I'm also an illustration major in a big city. Last year, I faced immense burnout due to mental health, and being bullied by my roommates. I'm currently living off campus, and I feel that my environment has helped me to create art again. Would it be easier on your mental health or more affordable to attend part-time, or less so that you're enrolled? Or, taking a semester off to work and returning in the spring? Have you been in burnout over the summer? Are you dreading going back? I asked myself these questions a few months ago to gauge if the stress was worth enduring again. I saw my major as a possible culprit, and decided to veer towards animation in the fall. Also, crafts, glass, sculpting, or any practice outside of illustration may help redirect and reignite the passion. Art school is really expensive, and like you said, so is living downtown. Personally, my living situation takes precedence. I wish you luck in finding the best solution.

I know it seems impossible now, but you will get through this. When I broke up with my first love after a 5 year relationship, I was distraught. I couldn’t eat, sleep, I was having nightmares and I lost an obscene amount of weight. I too didn’t think I would make it, I just wanted to disappear. I felt like everyone was mocking me for being so naive. It truly is a grieving process and treat it just as such, it will help with the healing. Tell yourself that the person you were with has “passed on”, they are no longer the person you were in love with, and that’s perfectly okay. My mom always told me “you don’t want to be with someone who doesn’t want to be with you”. I promise you the relationship will never be the same, you will always feel unworthy, paranoid, uneasy if you got back together or he changes his mind. You do not want this man to be with you out of pity. I promise you, I’ve been there, I begged and pleaded with this man to not leave me, to see my worth. I look back now and I’m absolutely mortified that I was so wrapped up in this man to feel self worth. Almost 12 years later and it is a part of my life I continue to reflect on, but I have learned so much about myself since then and I know now that that relationship was not healthy. I’ve since moved on with my life and have a lovely fiancé, who truly is my best friend and we have a beautiful family. He has never made me question my self worth or my value in his life.

He wasn’t worth your love if he was willing to trade it all for another. He isn’t a good friend if he’s allowing his “other friend” to taunt you about it. He didn’t even let you do the cutting off. Either way it was very much needed. This will sting for a while and that pain may feel like an eternity but trust it will come to an end. You will find that love again, in yourself and in another.

"Queen, if he ever tries to come back don’t let him. If he honestly cared and loved you the way you seem to love him he wouldn’t have left you or hurt you the way he did. 

I implore you to do some time by yourself. I remember at one point I was in your shoes dang near begging for a guy to not leave me. But NO ONE should EVER BEG for anything from their partner. 

The fact that you are willing to beg means you need to spend time reflecting and pouring love into yourself because you don’t realize that you are deserving of someone who will treat you like a queen. You don’t see how valuable and amazing you are, and the minute that you do you will realize you will never be on your knees for no one. 

Its rough getting over heartbreak, especially when you believe to your core you poured all yourself into it. But just like everyone said you’ll move on. Work on building friendships, getting into any hobbies you never had time for. Date yourself! You’ll be amazed what comes out on the other side.

But he may have done you a favor; better now than if you lifted your life and moved to be with him. He has made it clear where his priorities lie and it is not with you. That's okay, we are all entitled to our choices, and you should use this period to choose YOU,  to focus on yourself.  I know from experience it is easier said than done,  but baby! when you come out the other side,  you're going to love yourself so hard,  you'll wonder why you even gave him a second thought.

That relationship cost me years of growth, the opportunity to learn about myself, and the time I should have been using to learn to love myself.  Instead, I experienced trauma, gaslighting, and the loss of my sense of self.  
In your case, you may have believed that this person was the love of your life, but honestly, he wasn't even qualified to be a good friend to you.

now that i'm through it, and out on the other side of all that pain, despair, and heartbreak...i can actually laugh 😂. yes, at the time, i was in love and all that, but now that time has passed, and i've lived more life, met more people, gained more knowledge and wisdom, learned more about myself, changed things about myself.... it's all good and gravy now. i wouldn't take anyone from my past back. i have no desire to. and it's not even because they're bad people (except for one of them.... spawn of satan), it's simply because that part of my life and love are over, and it's always on to bigger and better things. 💃🏾 the world is full of new, and different, and interesting people. no need to fascinate and fixate on just one. especially if that one has been an ass to you. 😯😠😡🤬😥
sometimes it's easier said than done, especially in the beginning of the breakup or betrayal or whatever....but f@(k those people who willingly and purposely let you down. 👎🏾 f@(k him and the loser person who was hanging out in the background while he did it. kind and decent people don't behave like this. do whatever you can to let this mess go, and build your courage up for your new and future life ahead. cry when you need to, be angry when you need to, but don't let fear or anger dictate how you feel about your value and your worth. you are still valuable and worthy of love and tenderness and affection, in spite of what losses  you are going through now. take all the time you need to heal yourself, and find new things in life to look forward to. wishing you all the best. 😘❤️💝🤗🌹🍀🕊️🧸"	Far_Doctor_1883	reply	na	na	na	0.9987969398498535	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

It's okay to mourn and grieve the end of a relationship. I know how much it hurts and how hard it is to cope with the loss of someone you loved. You are not alone in this as we have (mostly) have all been there. You deserve to be happy. You have so much to offer to the world, and to someone else who will stick it out with you thru thick and thin. Don’t let this breakup define you or diminish your worth. You are strong, resilient, and capable of overcoming any challenge, despite the anxiety/depression. Life isn't over, this chapter might be but you get to write a new one starting now. Remember that this too shall pass, and that there is always hope for the future. You have a bright and beautiful future ahead of you even when it doesn't seem like it.

I'm not suggesting OP do this, but once feelings have subsided a lot and you're not crying about them every day but every now and again. Then I'd definitely open my heart to someone new.

Lol you most def do not need to date in order to grow as a person, although dating people and going through those things (getting rejected/ your heart broken) can potentially help you grow, but that’s just because experiences help you grow as a person in general. I’ve never dated anyone/had my heart broken/been rejected, but I’d say I’ve grown just from what I’ve experienced in life, no dating needed.

"I don't know. 

I think there are a lot of lessons that come with attempting to build a life with someone else. 

But on the flip side, not everyone needs those lessons. And not everyone is meant to grow through one specific avenue.  

Look, I met my husband in high school and he's been my only relationship. He's never broken my heart and he's never rejected me. I never felt those things in a romantic sense.

Bt you know what did break my heart? Burying my nana. And burying my stepdad after my bio dad left me never to return. 

You what did teach me rejection? Being fired from my first college job, and being rejected after interviewing from six different jobs that I busted my ass to prepare for.

"I'm a late bloomer myself and delayed starting to date until my late 20s. 

 It's a mixed bag, tbh. 

I spent a lot of time on personal development and have a strong sense of self and identity compared to many people I know who have been serially dating since young. Lived and worked abroad. I'm comfortable and happy with who I am, I have firm boundaries and expectations for how I'm treated and know I can stand on my own feet and don't \~need\~ anyone . I have rich platonic relationships I've maintained and kept going for years. I have a full life and I've developed a lot mentally.

But now that I am dating -- I do feel like I'm a little behind. The guys I'm dating are coming out of divorces and I've been permanently single. It makes things feel a little unbalanced (though they usually don't care too much). Romantic relationships \*are\* different from friendships, the dynamics are different and I am absolutely developing new and different skills/understandings of adulthood since going into it. Music hits different now, haha. 

I also am realizing... I don't know what I want as much as I thought I did, and it's taken a few guys to start figuring out what actually works for me. I'm a little regretful I didn't start a couple of years earlier, I missed out on young love and more options for guys. 

I don't think you NEED it to grow, but I think it's an important part of the human experience and you are lacking some development without it, and you'll fall behind for what is the norm. 

 If it's something you want in the future I think you should start dipping your toe in the water even if you're not ready to start doing laps in the pool."	MickeyJane123	reply	na	na	na	0.9948422312736511	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

"As someone who doesn't date a lot, I actually think it's true. There are some skills that dating really sharpened for me, like vetting people, paying more attention to actions than words, setting and enforcing boundaries, saying no, being street smart, dealing with rejection, relating to men romantically. It also made me aware of things I wasn't aware of before, such as avoidant attachment issues. It's probably true that we can get at least some of these things outside of dating, but dating is a skill that is learned through practice and the better we get, the easier it will be.

At the same time, if your friend can never be single, doesn't feel complete unless she has a man, and/or doesn't have a good track record when it comes to happy/healthy relaltionships, I would be cautious about how much I listened to her."

Many things cause growth; friend/family/work relationships, pursuing goals, the struggles that come with daily life, therapy, etc.  At every moment in our lives there is opportunity for growth as long as you are actively interested in exploring and working on yourself and getting healthy guidance.

That being said, if your goal is specifically to grow as a romantic/life partner, then yes, it will involve 
being in a romantic relationship.  Although you must work on yourself individually, you will never know if you are the kind of partner you want to be until being in the situation reveals aspects of yourself to you.

Okay so I'm very lucky in that my family had family reunions every other year starting in 1972. But it had fallen by the wayside as the older people died. A new group picked it up for 2020 but of course covid hit. Now we're about to have our first meeting about picking it up in 2024. As far as I'm concerned a one-year notice to plan a family reunion and for families to be able to afford to come in July is too quick. Am I being negative. I'm a single person who would actually have to fly 3,000 miles to the reunion and I can afford to go to the reunion but I have a big european vacation this year so I'm not putting any money into the planning before my trip like I did before. I bought and shipped all the Flyers about the reunion before it got canceled . I'm just starting to stress about this whole thing.

"Any Black ladies in London who might be able to steer me in the right direction on things I MUST do while visiting? At the end of August I'm traveling for a conference and ***bringing my mid 80s grandmother along with me***. I promised her when I was a kid to take her to Paris and since I'm going to be in London (she mentioned she wanted to go there too) I'm bringing her along and then we're going to go to Paris for a few days. I've been to Paris twice so I have a general idea of things to do there (up to suggestions though) but I've never been to London and frankly it was never on my ""to go"" list.

Anyhow, what are some MUST do activities? She's very mobile (is in a bowling league and goes walking) but I don't want to tax her too much! We both LOVE to read and I'm gifting her an e-reader for our flight but I would love to do some book stuff with her (fancy book stores).  We're also super duper into campy-ish stuff and horror. She and my Mom introduced me to vampire stuff when I was a kid!

SO far I have....

London Dungeon

The Shard

Hamilton

Hop on Hop off Bus Tour

* Big Ben
* Tower of London
* London Bridge

&#x200B;

Any Black-centric places to visit? I'm in NOLA and can run down the list of Black owned businesses, restaurants, and things to do from museums to tours so I'm wondering if there are similiar things to do in London?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Seriously any tips from Black ladies familiar with London would be appreciated!

"If you hop in the underground, you can hit up Brixton. It’s a pretty Black area. Think Carribbean descendants. I’ve only been once (we did a walking tour that’s in AirBnB experiences) but it was really nice. Make sure you both have credit cards that have tap features as the Underground and bus services have tap on/tap off (just make sure you tap off at your final destination!) so you don’t have to buy tickets. 

If you haven’t looked into it, check out the London Pass. I’m sure you have as it includes some of the things you’ve mentioned. If you haven’t booked anything, check out the pass for the days you’re going to be out and about. 

The big bus tour is great! Try and find out when the narrator will be on if your grandmother really likes history. Depending on your dates you might be able to catch a change of the guards.

Nope

If you want cheap hotels in London. Look into Travelodge. The Peckham and Lewisham one are quite new, so not that bad and are cheaper than other hotels. Also have good transport links"	Zelamir	reply	na	na	na	0.0021269023418426514	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
"Hotels versus Airbnb is your preference and budget. Just check the reviews before you book. London itself is priced out to its workers a long time ago. As far as “downtown” or central London, that’s also a budget thing and it’s kinda broad. European hotels have smaller rooms, but are likely to let you drop your bags off early (just check first). I prefer hotels so I don’t have to cook breakfast and taxis can find you easier. Just don’t stay in Mayfair area. It’s super expensive… but what side were you looking for?

Also, don’t be afraid to look at places a little farther out. The Underground and city bus have a max limit they charge on cards per day. So 0430 and 0429 the next morning, your card will be charged up to a certain amount depending on how far, where, and when you travel. So you shouldn’t come home with a 100£ charge for transportation. [You can read on that here](https://tfl.gov.uk/fares/find-fares/tube-and-rail-fares/pay-as-you-go-caps#on-this-page-1)

Edit to add: I usually go with my husband, but when my mom and MiL visited, we stayed in an Airbnb and it was nice too. Full kitchen. More than enough bathrooms and beds.

My depression started when I was 12 in middle school I was new to the school. Black and white little boys would comment about how ugly I was. Then same thing happened in high school for four years straight and now I’m in college whenever I had a crush on a guy he always tried to date my sister and stated that I was not his type but my sister is theirs. I feel unlucky and ugly all the time will this ever go away. I’m gonna go into my junior year of college and I swear if this keeps happening I will literally leave this planet. My sister never gets these comments because she is a model and she is the insta baddie black girl while I’m the ugly one that no one wants. i’ve been through counselling and nothing they say helps.	girluniversity	post	-4.105371654830719	male	White	0.9992191791534424	na	na	na	1	blackladies
"Sorry to hear this. Such ugly behavior from people. Honestly, I think spirituality and mindfulness helps. Anything you can do to cultivate awareness that is beyond you just being this life and this body helps. You are a little part of consciousness that just happens to manifest on what I am sure is a beautiful black woman. 

And no, largely society can't be depended on to validate you. BUT, you can get outfits that make you feel great in your skin and makeup to highlight your favorite features. Depending on your age, you could just be going through it because hormones/not really knowing who you are yet. 

Get intimate with the purpose of your life. Is it to develop a relationship with a higher being, to invent something amazing, or simply just to enjoy being here while you're here? All of these are valid, and can help you find the light that you are a person who exists for this mission, and you can dress your inner self up around that. 

My main point is, there is not a lot of validation found in life itself, but going deeper into your being, your purpose, and how you want to live makes you the most beautiful you. You will find many people who stake their identity in others thinking they are pretty or normal cannot hold a candle in the world of self-actualization. Learning to love the self can be life-changing."	girluniversity	reply	na	na	na	0.9992191791534424	strong	no	no	na	blackladies
"You might say Meetups? They seem kinda meh. Like it’s always old people doing swing dance or something. I’ve never really had friends. I grew up in a whites family.

All they say is wow you look like so and so loll. They’re all over the country and some reach out occasionally . My dad don’t give a shit tho lol.

To add to what everyone has said, maybe try and visit some of your other relatives (assuming you don’t already go and visit them). I know some people only have relationships online but I don’t think that’s how we need to be interacting with our family all the time. If you want a relationship with them, you’re going to have to be consistent. With any relationship, family, friend, romantic, consistency is key. And if they clown you, clown them right back! Some families show affection with light teasing. Obviously if they’re tearing down your self esteem, don’t engage, but if they say, oh that’s so ______, clap back, “it’s what I like; so what!” They will probably respect you more for standing up for yourself.

I’ve been in a similar vibe lately and I’m sorry because it truly sucks to feel like that. I’ve seen someone talk about affirmations and I agree; listening to positive messages before sleeping had helped me.  Doing cheap activities I love such as reading books, listening to my favorite music and cleaning up and dressing up while out but comfy at home has helped me feel better. Spending less time online had also helped. I’ve been thinking about my future but putting it into small goals and most importantly not comparing myself to others. I’ve also remembered that I’ve been in skunks before and it’s ok to feel sad but I’ve gotten out of them before dvd I will again and so will you.

— Watch your favorite guilty pleasure show on TV.
— There’s an Apple Music/Spotify playlist called “I’m Thriving’” from Paola Hernandez. Tons of uplifting songs/affirmations 
— Tell yourself you’ll do one good thing. Wash a dish, wipe down the bathroom sink. One good thing to make your space cleaner/clearer should give you a boost.

"I was a medical technologist for seven years and moved on about a year ago. Note: I've only ever worked in mid to large siaze hospital labs. I know reference labs like Lab Corp are more factory like and smaller labs like urgent care places require you to draw blood, neither of which appealed to me.

The main benefit of the field is job security. But this is because most places are chronically short staffed. The hecticness of a lab depends. If you know what area you will likely want to work, look at job postings, if hospitals are offering 10k sign on bonuses, they are desperate.
Nationwide, there is a huge shortage so you will always have a job. As I someone who has moved on, I like the job security and knowing I always have a career to fall back on.

The pay is honestly not amazing, unless you're in California, but it's not terrible either. In my area (central VA) you can  live comfortably, if you have a working spouse. If you are on your own, I think it would be tight. But again this varies greatly by the area. I'd check out the /r/medlabprofessionals and ask about your specific area, especially if you're not willing to relocate.

The other downside: there is not much of a career path. Your only option to get out of the lab is to go into management or pivot to another field.

"i (23nb afab) have mainly just been dating other black people, so this was never a concern to me up until now. i started dating my boyfriend at the start of this year and things have been great! he’s super educated, understanding, and isn’t judgmental in any ways or forms. 

i feel really comfortable around him not only because he’s great, but he also has a lot of black friends so i’ve never felt the need to “introduce” any parts of me to him. even tho i feel safe, for some reason i just can’t stop code-switching when i talk to him. i really want to be my 100% authentic self with him, but i feel like i can’t since my brain just wont let me be me! 

have any of you had this kind of issue before? and if so, how were you able to overcome it? sometimes the mask will end up slipping off, but once my brain catches it, it just comes right back on. i really want to keep it off, i just don’t know how.

ETA: there’s quite a few comments accusing him of not being open/comfortable with my blackness and putting the blame on him. i just wanted to clarify that that’s not the case. as stated in my post, he’s super educated, understanding, and isn’t judgmental. he surrounds himself with a lot of poc, black people included, so nothing is new to him. i wouldn’t be dating him if i felt like he was uncomfortable with me. 

my issues with code-switching are my own. i was raised in the suburbs and was heavily pushed into code-switching whenever i was around nb folk. i don’t do it because i’m uncomfortable, i do it because that’s what i’ve been taught to do my entire life and all i’m trying to ask is how to let go of that. it’s not intentional, if anything it’s muscle memory. i just want to learn how to make it stop."	dennekie	post	15.175871342371417	female	White	0.003255140734836459	na	na	na	92	blackladies

My partner is not white, but he’s non-black. For a long time, I’d talk to him in a certain way. Then, he met my friends and saw me interact with them and asked, “why do you talk like that with them but not me?”

The answer is that I only really speak with a blaccent if there are people there to match that energy. Maybe it was ingrained me as a kid (because my parents are BIG respectability politics ppl), but it’s almost impossible for me to speak like that in front of people who also don’t speak like that.

I’ve gotten a little better over time with speaking more naturally around him, and he seems to appreciate it.

"I got caught up in financial literacy young, and have stressed over saving money to afford a rich lifestyle that would allow me to pay for things like traveling, retirement funds, and plastic surgery. 

I've spent the past 4 years of my life trying to figure out what I'll do after graduating high school, and now I'm going to university for Computer Science admittedly because many STEM jobs pay very well. I don't really have a passion for it, nor am I gifted with STEM abilities but haven't found any other paths and felt rushed.

It's hard to explain this to people in real life because they can take the time to think through what they want in life while I've always just wanted to feel like I was working towards SOMETHING clear.

Essentially, I'm just tired of being worried about never truly being able to live the life that I've wanted for a long time. I find happiness in smaller things for now, but still worry about never achieving my financial goals. So much to do with little time and money. Can I get some advice/tips on how I can begin moving toward a better future? Any resources?

"You simply may not have a “dream job”, most of us don’t and I think it’s really healthy for those of us who don’t to let that idea go. 

It’s more common to not dream of labor. In my 20s I learned that trying to turn my hobbies into profit didn’t serve me. It just made me hate whatever the hobby was eventually. 

I think it’s best for those of us who aren’t passionate about a certain profession to find a job that gives us the life we want to afford and is tolerable. 

How much money do you want to make minimum?

How much free time do you want realistically from your job? 

Do you want a set schedule, work remotely, do you  mind if your job demands your time outside of your scheduled hours? 

Those are good questions to start with to narrow down what career path is right for you. 

Just be aware that for most careers the more money the more of your time and mental energy it’s probably going to take. 

I think a therapist would help you greatly so you don’t experience burnout if you can afford it and aren’t in therapy already. 

But be gentle with yourself. I know you probably don’t want to hear about how young you are, but just know that your needs and desires are likely going to change so so much from 18-25.

"You are definitely getting ahead of the game with scholarships. 

At 18, it’s unfair to have the expectation that you need to know what you wanna do for the rest of your life. 

And from what you’ve shared, you’re interested in a career that fulfills and sustains you. What are the things that do that for you now? Any topics or issues that drive you’re curiosity? Any experiences that stayed with you? What have you been drawn towards? What are your strengths? Is there a particular impact you want to have on the world or your community? Is there someone who is currently doing work or making impacts or having a career you’d like? 

Beyond reflecting on questions like those above, you’ve got to explore. Within your networks (family, employment, memberships, university, social media, etc.) are there folks in varying careers you could shadow for a day? Or interview to learn about their work and related career options? 

You will not be able to make the best decision for yourself with limited information so I encourage you to think creatively about ways to learn about different career options and to the extent possible, get some firsthand exposure.

"I posted in birth control but I wanted to see if any of you ladies could provide some clarity. I’ve been using Nexplanon for the past 4 going on 5 years and overall - it’s been a decent experience. The last year or so, I’ve noticed that I’ve been struggling to lose weight and a significant dip in my sex drive and ability to get wet with my partner. 

Before starting birth control, I sat at 125 pounds. I thought with Covid, the gyms closing, and everything else my weight gain was just due to lack of activity. I’ve been sitting at 140 pounds for the past two years + and that’s with diet and training with a personal trainer. I just turned 23 and I’ve been using lube with partner for over a year since I can’t seem to get or stay wet. It’s embarrassing. I’m happy that I’ve never had to deal with depression or feeling low on birth control, but I’m sad about how much effort I’ve put into losing the weight and how it’s not working. I also want to have desire to sleep and enjoy sex with partner but it’s just a chore now and before making the connection that it could possibly be my birth control, I thought maybe I just was losing attraction to him. 

I have an appointment coming up with a new gynecologist and I really want recommendations of what new birth control I should look into or coming off it all together."	oh-honneyy	post	46.3690117494539	male	White	0.9932576417922974	na	na	na	8	blackladies
I'm assuming you've had your nexplanon replaced already. I've had the pill, shot and nexplanon and nexplanon has been the best experience for me as far as side effects and not having to remember to take a pill.

"Your Nexplanon might be ""wearing off"". I believe they have a 3-5 year lifespan, so if you're starting to see issues in the 4th year that might be it. If you want to try removing the old one and going with a new one, you can talk to your new obgyn about that option.

Before I used Nexplanon, I used Mirena (rejected TWICE and my now ex hubs was unexcited about being poked by a piece of plastic every time we were intimate -- but also was installed by a med student who was learning), NuvaRing (which I loved bc of the 3 weeks on and 1 week off, and no complaints about discomfort from partners or for me!), and the daily birth control pill in the 28 day pack. I really liked Mirena (minus the rejection part!) and Nexplanon worked a bit better for me in that regard because it was inserted in my arm and not in the uterine lining. I'm a bit too ditzy to remember daily meds (FML 😭) so the 28 day pill packs were less than ideal for me. NuvaRing was a good median because I could mark on my calendar twice per month (insert and remove) and not forget.

"I’m really struggling. It’s been that way for years now. I’m finally at a place in my life where I should be happy, but I’m not. Like I’m grateful for every blessing I have, but I still feel a lot of loneliness and feeling unworthy of just love and happiness. I’m in therapy and taking medicine, but it feels like nothing has changed. I’ve really been trying, but I cry myself to sleep almost every night. 

I have moments where I just hate how I look. It’s been even harder because people have always made fun of my weight. Even one guy I was seeing in the past. He called me unattractive & fat. I swear I hear his cruel words replay through my mind like an endless loop. My experience with men overall has made me feel undesirable & just afraid of intimacy again, out of fear of being judged by my body and everything else. I also worked in an industry where i was in the public’s eye and people were so mean and made comments about my body and looks. Im still trying to recover from what I experienced in the past. I don’t have much friends and spend time alone I feel so depressed.

My parents are getting older and I have anxiety on losing them because I don’t know how I’d cope with the loss of a parent and  I feel like I won’t have a reason to live anymore if they’re gone. 

I just want to feel better and be better, but I feel like I’ve been on a never ending loop of self improvement and end up right where I started. 

It’s  discouraging when you put in all the work (therapy/ medicine ) and still feel no changes. I’ve been in therapy since I was a teenager, I’m 30 now. Granted, I wasn’t seeing great therapists during my adolescent years and 20s. One of them took advantage of me and that was also a tough time for me and took some time for me to get over. 

I’m really hoping this time around, I can finally heal. I’ve also been on the same medicine/ dosage for the past 7 years, so I hope that finally being able to afford to see a psychiatrist again, that i can find the right meds for me soon. 
For those who’ve been in my shoes, how long did it take for you to heal?"	yuckyblucky197	post	30.87385846202819	male	White	0.9973533153533936	na	na	na	5	blackladies
"Ok so first you need to understand time is a construct and your inner demons dont give a damn about it.  
Medication is there to help you fight them.  
But sis if you're not even getting in the ring they aren't going anywhere.  


So to answer your question, I was in your mindset for maybe 10 years. Then when I realized no one was going to come save me (not time, not meds, not doctors) things started moving along.  
Weight loss: After 1 year Ive gone from an XL to a M. I just cut sugar I didnt work out.  
Fibromyalgia: After losing weight the pain doesnt affect me at all like it used to. I kinda forgot I had it honestly  
Depression: After 1 year I no longer have any desire to kms. I wanna die and I feel like im better off dead... but im not going anywhere. I feel like I got this. Been slowly dabbling in hobbies. I've been smiling again. My eyes are dull anymore. I started caring for myself and being kind to myself.  
Anxiety: After 1 year I can leave my house without having panic attacks :D Still anxious and still working on it  
BPD: After 1 year I've finally accepted I have it. I became proactive in learning about my disorder. Journaling has helped drastically.  
PTSD: After 1 year of seeing a therapist skilled in trauma 3-4x a week, I no longer have nightmares :)  
Job: I found some freelance work I enjoy. it's enough to pay the bills while I focus on myself.  


I hope this puts things into perspective."	yuckyblucky197	reply	na	na	na	0.9973533153533936	no	no	no	na	blackladies
Have you considered joining an activity or gym? Like kickboxing or Pilates or strength training? Things like these gives you space to let out all of that anxiousness and move your body. I totally understand these feelings as I struggle with depression and anxiety. I joined a strength training gym to get better blood work and lower high blood pressure and I love it. All the stress from work and life melts away and though it’s hard to get going, I feel so much better after going. The community is great and encouraging as well. It doesn’t have to be exercised based either, are there any hobbies you’d like to start? Clubs you’d like to join? Medicine and therapy are great but maybe you need something extra.	yuckyblucky197	reply	na	na	na	0.9973533153533936	no	strong	strong	na	blackladies
"There is no 'healing' for me; that's not how my mental health disability works. I manage it with medication, and therapy when I feel I need it. I will never not have depression and anxiety, my agoraphobia is in remission but could return in the future as it has in the past. 

I have dysmorphia and I've been able to overcome it to a certain degree, but I'll never have a healthy body image and I've avoided having relationships because of it.

I don't know if healing is a thing-- it's a lifelong journey for me, and there are going to be pitfalls, relapses and obstacles along the way. I'm under no illusion that I'm ever going to be 'healed', so I don't dwell on that, because I'll end up beating myself up the way I did for decades, when I was treating my depression and other conditions as character failings, not as mental illnesses.

What helps me is not focusing on wanting to be 'healed' or 'cured', because that's not my goal. My goal is to live as good a life as I can, when I can, and that is often difficult to do. 

Some days I'm living, some days I'm just existing. But working towards having more good days than bad keeps me on an even keel, and the right medication at the right dose helps enormously, too. 

Maybe you could try not focusing on ""when will I be healed/I should be at X place by now/I should be happy because I have X.""

There is no 'should'. There is no timetable. There is no state of being that should make you punish yourself for not being or feeling what you think you ought to. 

Remember all the critics of Megan Markle? They were saying she shouldn't be depressed or suicidal because she's rich, famous, royal, in a happy marriage, with children. She has a better life than most, therefore she can't possibly be unhappy and has no right to be mentally unwell. 

But that's not how it works. So maybe you could try and lessen the expectations you're placing on yourself and instead try and take things one day at a time while being kinder to yourself. 

Maybe try not to see your mental ill health as a journey of self improvement-- or even as a journey at all. If you're on medication this isn't just a matter of self improvement, you have a health issue which isn't going to be fixed with some life coaching, positive thinking or a self help book.

Cut yourself some slack. It sounds like you're too hard on yourself. You think you should be in a certain headspace because you have a certain lifestyle where you think you don't have any right to be depressed. 

But your mental ill health doesn't care where you are in life. It's like living in a palace while having arthritis-- does being in a palace make the arthritis go away? Does having servants and a gold carriage mean you're not allowed to feel and complain about the pain the arthritis brings, to acknowledge how difficult it is to live with ?

Of course not. It's the same with mental ill health. Where you are in life doesn't matter. Keep up with the things that help you, find the meds and therapies that will be more helpful for you, and do your best to not make yourself feel guilty for being, feeling and reacting like a normal human."	yuckyblucky197	reply	na	na	na	0.9973533153533936	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

He’s shorter than me and that man treats me like a queen. He’s not self conscious of his height and at first, it bothered me (me being super short myself). Now, idc.

I gave him a chance and put my own insecurities aside and I have the best guy in the world (I’m being biased a bit lol).

My thing is, if the height doesn’t bother you, go for it. If it’s a non-negotiable thing for you (even if he’s super nice), don’t lower your standards.

Seems like you don't actaully like him. Nothing about his character or him as a person, just about how well he treats you and what he does for you. If you genuinely like him, I don't understand why his height specifically is an issue. I also don't understand how you have ""issues"" with a man being short when you're also...short.

>would you give a short guy a chance ?

Idk, I just don't like the wording of this whole thing. It seems like y'all have had multiple dates, so you already ""gave him a chance"" and you still have a problem. To me it sounds like he has to somehow prove himself (beyond what he already does, according to you) just because y'all are in the same height bracket. It's a lil weird.

"OK, most of the comments are short, so I'm going to be that person who drops a long one that probably no one will read:

First off: Do you like this man? 

Do you want to live your life and enjoy your time with a short man that treats you well (and is a better person than me, because daily complaining would be a hard pass) - or do you want to wait around until, potentially, a tall man with the same \*non-physical\* characteristics (generous, gentlemanly, good listener) comes around? Serious question.

If height is **that** important to you, let the man go - as you can see, plenty of women have no issue with it. Free him up for one of us. I went out with a guy last year, he wasn't 5'3 like me, but I'm sure he was under 5'6, and because of all his good qualities (physical and otherwise), I never even thought about his height. On the other hand, my 5'10 best friend would never entertain it. I've known her for a decade and she won't look your way if you're under 6'. Yep, she's one of those. Are you?

I don't say any of this to be mean - just direct. **No one wants their time wasted.** If you're going to tie up his heart and headspace (and wallet!) for three months and then cut and run because you need someone 5'8""+...just let him go now. **I just think about being on the opposite end of it and how I'd hate to feel like I clicked with someone, only to find out that something I couldn't change about myself was a problem for them.** I could have closed myself off to something better. Or just enjoyed my solitude.

I guess technically I *have* been there - many times actually. Maybe that's why this post stuck with me. I forget because I did so much dating in my 20s but my 30s have been dry as hell. The memories have started to fade. But:

* I dated a Jewish guy who was lovely -he was Israeli (like, born there) and I'm sure the only reason we dated for as long as we did is because his parents didn't live in the same state. There was no way there would be dinner with the family in our future. Black AND not Jewish? There's no way (for his family, can't speak for all, obviously).
* Went on a couple of dates with a muslim guy who casually dropped during a date that he'd want a muslim wife. So why are you on a date with ME? (I didn't know he was muslim until after we'd met. Otherwise, I could have predicted this outcome and saved my time). He was passing time with me, and I didn't appreciate that.
* I've only met one person's parents in the 18 years of dating I've done. I live in a city full of transplants, so its not unusual to be around people who only see their family once or twice a year. I bring that up to say: I'm sure there are several of those (white) men I wouldn't have gone out with for long (or at all) if their families were close by. I don't take into consideration what my family thinks about who I date - but MANY people do. So, if being in a relationship with a Black woman is something your family isn't comfortable with - and that impacts your feelings and actions, don't do it.
* You didn't say *why* you have a problem with his height. But I know some women don't want to be seen with a short/shorter man. They feel embarrassed. I certainly didn't see it in the moment, but years later looking back at some of my experiences, I'm almost positive I went out with at least a couple of people who thought I was great - privately. But there was never an effort or offer for me to meet anyone in their lives (friends, family, coworkers). This being Los Angeles and me being completely practical, odds are they didn't find me attractive enough to have on their arm (some of these men were HOT). Thank god they treated me well to my face, otherwise it would have damaged my spirit for sure. But years later, looking back, it starts to click.

All that rambling to say - **you just have to ask yourself what you value and why**. He can't change his height. **So you need to decide which kind person you are** \- yes, I close my eyes sometimes and think about being wrapped in the arms of a tall strong man (I'm sure most women who date men have at some point), but eyes open and living in reality, if a guy is kind, funny, smart and has his life together, if we're compatible - I'm not thinking about his height and never have. My bestie - she flat out does not care. You need to be taller than her in heels. We all have our dealbreakers."	idkdidksuus	reply	na	na	na	0.006221354473382235	weak	no	strong	na	blackladies

I gave a short guy a chance once when I was 22 & it was actually really cool. I’m 5’4. He was maybe 5’6 or 5’7. Personality wise he was one of the best guys I ever dated. We dated for like a year or something. But when we had sex for the first time, it was terrible - to me, not to him, he was having the time of his life!😂We didn’t last long after that😂.

To me height is a factor but not the only factor. It should be weighed in conjunction with other factors like how he treats you, how otherwise attractive he is, if he has similar values to you ect ect.

Funny thing when my ex and I met I didn’t know how y’all he was. I went to the airport to pick him up and boom he is legit like two inches shorter than me. I instantly felt insecure, but proceeded to our little trip. The trip was amazing and probably the best date I have ever been on and the sex was even better. Fast forward a few year later and he is now taller than me lol he legit went from 5’4ish to 5’9-10 and just fine as wine. Mind you he was like 25 when we met so idk how he grew at that age. I am glad I dated him because I learned about men and myself in that relationship. I would definitely do it all over again because it was an amazing experience.

"I am currently giving a short guy a chance right now and am sooo glad I did!

He’s an old friend from college who I reconnected with recently and we’ve been on a few dates and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed them. So far he has been nothing but a respectful gentlemen, he’s so sweet and funny and caring.

He’s serious about pursuing a romantic monogamous relationship with me and is honest and knows how to communicate which is so refreshing.

The only hesitation I initially had was him being short, he’s only 5 feet 5 inches tall. I had this silly rule where I wouldn’t date anyone shorter than 5 foot 6 since that’s my sister’s height. But I am also only 5 feet tall and am very short, and what matters is that he’s taller than me. Which there is a height difference between us lol.

Height really is so arbitrary. I would’ve felt foolish in hindsight to not give him a chance just because he’s shorter than the average man. And he’s also not one of those short guys who projects their insecurities about being short or has a chip on their shoulder about it.

 I know short men aren’t for everybody’s preferences but I’d rather be with a short guy with a great personality who’s respectful, than a tall guy who lacks all those positive traits."	idkdidksuus	reply	na	na	na	0.006221354473382235	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

You basically have to pretzel yourself into a tiny ball and cramp up when he wants to be the big spoon because you don’t fit. I’ve noticed from prior experience it annoys me.

"A girl (well, woman now) from high school married a very short man and they are as happy as can be. Not because his height has anything’s to do with it, but because he’s a real man. I’m sure he was insecure about it at one point in his life but the dude has a crazy charisma about him, work ethic, passion, everything she would need in a husband. He’s as much a man as a 6ft guy and he has his head on straight.

That being said- do you truly like him or are you tolerating him? How much is this gonna bother you down the road? Is giving him a “chance” gonna backfire when you really like him but can’t see yourself with a short man long-term? If there’s an inkling in your mind that you won’t be able to deal with it, then I’d say just leave it alone."	idkdidksuus	reply	na	na	na	0.006221354473382235	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

"5'10 here too. Back when I was dating, I had the most trouble with guys who were close to my height (especially because I liked wearing heels). 5'6 and under was absolutely my preference. They knew that I would always be taller than they were (shoes or no shoes) and so it became a non issue. And the ones that approached me were confident, secure, and quite charming -- they developed great personalities because they couldn't just rely on being the tall guy in the room to capture attention. Since I'm most interested in a person's character and how we develop as a couple, something completely out of one's control, like height, didn't matter to me.

Of course, there are jerks out there, short and tall, but I didn't let height factor into my dating selection."	idkdidksuus	reply	na	na	na	0.006221354473382235	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

"Dr. Hadiyah-Nicole Green — a multi-disciplinary physicist and the second African American woman to graduate with a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Alabama at Birmingham — has become the first to successfully cure cancer using laser-activated nanoparticles. According to Black Culture News, she received a $1.1 million grant to expand her nanoparticle cancer treatment research.

As the founder of Ora Lee Smith Cancer Research Foundation, Dr. Green’s revolutionary nanoparticle technology does not require patients to undergo chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery and was found to successfully cure cancer after testing on mice within 15 days.

According to Black Culture News, Dr. Green’s interest in cancer treatment stems from witnessing the death of her aunt, Ora Lee, who suffered from cancer and her uncle, General Lee Smith, who also was diagnosed with cancer and experienced the negative side effects of traditional chemotherapy treatment."	niblizx	post	37.81922262814011	female	White	0.001798751880414784	na	na	na	35	blackladies

Guys, not to be a buzzkill, but this is media fluff and a terribly misleading headline. While Dr Green is very accomplished, the article is from 2020 and references a paper Dr Green published in 2014 which demonstrates efficacy in treating squamous cell cancer in mice. This isn’t ‘curing cancer,’ it’s basic science research. This type of cancer can also be ‘cured’ by cutting it out in a doctors office. Definitely more than I’ve done! But It’s misleading to say this doesn’t require patients to undergo chemo/whatever because it’s not proven or available for human patients. This kind of frothy hype over theoretical medical advances is terrible for patients who are often very desperate. I hope Dr Green continues her research and the technology works in humans.	niblizx	reply	na	na	na	0.001798751880414784	no	no	no	na	blackladies

"My (23NB) barber (37M) told me yesterday during my  SECOND haircut with him that he wants me and is very flirtatious naturally so I should expect him to be pushing up on me a little bit. He also told me, though, that he wants my business and doesn't want to lose a  regular, so if I'm ever uncomfortable he can stop (which I really appreciate because a lot of men have disrespected me in various ways and never seem to care how I feel).

I was already thinking how handsome he was (gorgeous dark skin, tattoos but not too many and nothing on the face, muscular but not too muscular, NC accent etc) so when he said to me yesterday during my haircut that he ""wants"" me, I was floored but not unreceptive. We smoked a couple of cigarettes outside together and we had some good long hugs (he kissed me on the cheek which I wasn't comfortable with but I let it slide because he's so sweet and I needed that) before I left. I think he's picking me up during my lunch break to grab something to eat today, but I'm so nervous. This is all happening so fast.

I told him that I only wanted a friend and that I'm not in the emotional place right now to be in a relationship anyway let alone one LDR and one here, but he was very respectful and told me that he only wanted me to feel safe. He told me that he like long walks by the water and reading and conversation and scary movies... I love all of those things too. We talk politics while I'm in the chair and he's smart and educated (idk if he went to college but that's not what I mean by ""educated) and he gave me a discount on my cut which was nice because I'm strapped for cash rn. 

Idk, this is all happening so fast. I have a bf already who I love but he's across the country from me right now and will be for the next year. I told him about this guy and he seemed happy for me that somebody would be ""taking care of [me]"" while he was gone (as in, taking me on dates and giving me hugs). The barber also knows about my bf and just told me to tell him that I have a new boyfriend while he's gone. Idk, this is all happening so fast and I never expected it. I've never been in this situation before, I've never even really been with a Black man, and I'm scared that he will hurt me somehow (he was drinking as he was cutting my hair at 6 pm which kind of made me wary but he didn't fuck up my haircut or get drunk and I guess that's a normal time to be drinking????) but I also desperately need a friend (not to mention an African American friend, those are VERY hard to come by out here). He's so sweet and kind and loves kids (he reminds me of my dad not in a creepy way but my dad is a good man even if he has his flaws like anyone) and is, in his own words, ""just a big baby."" I told him that I love babies, so that's fine (I do love them lol).

Idk, I know this sounds like the plot of a Tyler Perry movie, but I'm just very taken with him and had to tell somebody who would get it. Is the age gap too much? One of my exes was 30 and we started dating when I was freshly 20 so that kind of left a bad taste in my mouth concerning dating men in their 30s: does the age gap seem too big? I know that I'm getting way ahead of myself but I'm just so excited to have made a new friend who's AA and WANTS me (even if I don't plan to have sex with him anytime soon if ever) and idk... I'll stop rambling now lol

UPDATE: Thanks for the advice, yall. Idk what I was thinking. He is, in hindsight, extremely slick and very experienced with taking advantage of vulnerable people clearly. He gave one clearly unwell woman a bunch of bus passes, which at first I thought was sweet, until I actually started asking myself why she can't just get them herself. It seemed like something was being withheld from her to me, honestly, and that's really evil. Also, he was putting the moves on an older woman (i asked her age when she told me her son is my age: she's 43, and was also very clearly strung out on something. Now my heart is just aching for the women in his life who have to deal with this manipulative man. I blocked his number and will NEVER talk to him again. Thank the Lord that he never showed up to my job (though he asked me when my break was like he was gonna help me out???) and I never told him where I work, so there's no chance of him pulling up on me without my consent... I am so grateful. And I am grateful for this community, too. Thanks a lot, yall."	blackelvira	post	27.217145585572396	female	White	0.001370220328681171	na	na	na	80	blackladies

this gave off humongous red flags immediately and they kept coming. listen to your intuition, to your body.. they know how you really feel, even if your thoughts and emotions are all over the place. if it seems like a bad idea, it usually is. you don’t need proof, which usually comes when it’s too late, to say “thank you but no thank you”. just make sure to protect yourself, you owe him **nothing**. you can be kind and polite, but you owe yourself everything. prioritize what’s really best for you, not just what feels best, because sometimes our feelings focus only on the destination (companionship, love, connection..) and don’t care about how to get there. the end doesn’t always justify the means, you know?	blackelvira	reply	na	na	na	0.001370220328681171	weak	no	no	na	blackladies

This is definitely an opportunity to learn, enforce boundaries, and strengthen your resistance against this form of treatment. You are in your early 20s now, I promise things will get worse if you allow yourself to view this kind of behavior as typical of the environment, especially since you are new to going to a barbershop. Allowing yourself to remain in this kind of environment will follow you out of the shop and set the stage for men you meet later. Find another barber, don't sit in a chair where someone is sexually harass you. Don't give them any level of power over you in a vulnerable state like this, or your body will begin to normalize the experience. Even if you aren't sure where to go next, just try a few places out and shop around until you find a spot that feels right.

"Ditto over 30 years at barbers, not once, even before I was married.

My guy hugs me at the end of each cut, but it isn't sexual.  He hugs my husband also when my husband comes in. 

I've had older barbers, younger barbers, friends who cut my hair, no one ever got out of pocket in the shop, or drank alcohol, smoked, etc. while cutting my hair. 

He's friendly, from NOLA, and knows how to keep me as a weekly customer. 

He's also very attractive. 

Find a new barber. 

And you are going on a date if he's picking you up for lunch.

Also your LDR doesn't sound exclusive since your boyfriend is okay with this. 

My husband is on assignment in another part of the country.  He isn't home weekly, he knows I go out with friends, straight, gay, etc. but all of them are friends, that's it.  If I said something like you said to my husband, he would not be happy with me and tell me don't see that guy.

Although this is still very much a plate from I consider it to have education benefits so I won’t count it. But I recently decided to have a social media break because I found myself comparing my life to others, also I found myself harping over being nearly 30 and single while never really being in a serious relationship that was healthy. I truly don’t believe I’m attractive and I wish I didn’t but nothing can convince me other wise because I truly don’t like what I see when I look in the mirror and I wish that I had what was “Worthy.” Of love. It’s not good tbh. I wish I didn’t feel that way but it comes from a lot of past trauma. Don’t get me wrong I may not like myself but I don’t feel that I should be treated poorly so finding partners has not been easy because I’m not afraid to walk away from anything abusive or unhealthy. It’s just I’m not looking at me healthy, even if I’m not meeting black men’s beauty standards shouldn’t I still like what I see when I look in the mirror. I decided to delete dating apps and facebook until I feel better and I regroup and find some level of mental clarity.

"Okay! I am 22f had a baby last year. Went from 100-115 at the heaviest to 176 at the end of my pregnancy and I’ve been fluctuating between 174/186 for the whole summer
Granted, it could be by birth control I haveNexplanon. So get this, my body and mind is not used to this. I’m in school working here and there shitty jobs and sometimes I donate plasma and I feel I’ve developed an unconscious eating disorder. It’s definitely the BC that’s making me gag but I can’t eat like I used to. I can only eat two bites even if I have an appetite. I repel like my mind and body is your too fat and your too poor. This way you’ll lose weight and save but it’s been bad…the other day I was doordahsing and instacarting ig from 5am to 4pm and I forgot to eat I was like ohh I eat after I donate so I end up donating 883/881 and I felt got on base to visit my fiancé and bring us a pizza. Now this happens when I was at fort liberty (fort Bragg) where while I walking to my car from Commissary and I got lightheaded …brushed it off.. then while I was at light, super weird light btw about to turn right by WHOLE BODY LOCKED UP I COULD NOT MOVE MY HANDS OR MY FEET OR MY LEGS OR ARMS JUST MY HEAD so I was temporarily paralyzed it was scary but it went way after 20 MINUTES!!!!!!!!!! 

I’m not pregnant I don’t drink I don’t do drugs. I walk when I can. The air quality index is Ass and I don’t have AC in my car I’m just tired of looking like sloppy and feeling weak all the time. They say I’m healthy every time I donate no anemia. 
So what do I do? What do I eat? How ? when? What did I do what is wrong with me lol. How do I lose this weight without continuing this weird eating disorder. Helpppppp meeeee"	professionalnegro24	post	18.95528390877551	female	White	0.9984127283096313	na	na	na	12	blackladies

"This sounds like (edit: severe) anxiety. I can relate-- being so anxious that my mind (and in your case your body) becomes so paralyzed that I'm desensitized to eating. Even if I'm dying for some water or I'm about to faint/ my stomach hurts so bad because I haven't eaten all day, I still won't eat.  It's interesting bc for years I always was a stress eater. I'm starting to notice I get this form of anxiety after a load of trauma, usually a series of traumatic events that I never got the chance to recover from and my nerves are so shot because essentially my mind is disconnected from my body. Maybe the same is for you.

You're going to have to calm your nervous system down and go step by step. What helps is to give yourself a structure to *just eat*. When you get up in the morning, make a bowl of cereal or eat the easiest thing you can for breakfast. Eat a sandwich (or something) at 11/your decided lunch time. When you get home, put something in your mouth. What you're doing is setting up and rebuilding that system in your body of ""When it is meal time I EAT."" From there, you can build on switching out that bowl of cereal to some oatmeal or eggs, the sandwich for a salad with some chicken and your dinner to being whatever you grab to something more healthful. Then set out a goal of how much weight you want to lose, what pace is realistic (1 or 2 pounds a week or something more aggressive if you want to go keto etc.). Then look at your exercise options. And so on and so on.

It's hot AF where I live too, and I love walking it sucks that I can't go for a walk unless it's at like 5am or at 9pm. There's tons of videos on YouTube that you can do. I recommend yoga. Yoga With Adrienne saved my life when I was too nervous that I couldn't cognitively function after so much stress. Yoga was the only thing that could help me recenter my mind and reconnect with my body. She has anywhere from 10 minute practices to hour long practices and all types of levels, so don't feel pressured to go all in at once. It's also excellent for your body and getting into shape. And I was able to do her videos while DoorDashing as well. Those 10 minute videos come in clutch. I get that it's exhausting doing gig work.

Lastly, look into some therapy options. It's two fold why yoga is awesome because even if you can't go to therapy right away, yoga and meditation help a lot with giving yourself some self care time and time to calm your mind before you're able to see someone to talk about what's been stressing you. I wasn't able to get therapy until a month or so ago and it's been really helpful to talk to a neutral third party who can offer understanding and compassion. I've found when you start to feel that YOU'RE on your own side as well as other people are on your side, you relax even more and will probably feel more comfortable to not only eat but go after the goals you're setting out for yourself. Wanting to get back into shape is an awesome goal to have, it's just a matter of getting your mind right first so you can put your best foot forward."	professionalnegro24	reply	na	na	na	0.9984127283096313	weak	strong	no	na	blackladies

It's hard to tell what's causing the weight gain because there are a lot of new things going on for you right now. New medication, yes, but also new baby and new marriage on the way and I can imagine the more weight you gain, the more stressful it becomes. It's easy to blame Nexplanon, but correlation is not the same as causation. It could be the BC, but like others have said, it could also be stress related to another aspect of your life right now or a culmination of all the changes together. I would definitely speak to a doctor, especially an African-American woman doctor, if you can find one. It also may be helpful to speak to a licensed therapist who specializes in anxiety and disordered eating, also African-American if available. Psychology Today has a website that can help you find therapists in your area and filter by insurance. As for weight loss, eating low carb Paleo is something that works for me. Even if you're not able to commit to low-carb eating, regular Paleo or Whole30 are healthy and relatively easy diets to follow if you're able to meal prep and willing to try new recipes, which you'd have to do regardless if you really want to lose weight.

When asking about birth control my doctor said Nexplanon isn't great for a multitude of reasons, but it does increase appetite so causes weight gain. Everything you've described though? You need to talk to a doctor and maybe a therapist.

"I’m going to try to make a long post short. I started working at an office in a corporate setting 2 months ago and I’m noticing that my manager is racist asf and is showing that she doesn’t like me. I want to cuss that old Humpty Dumpty looking woman out but I need this job. Today I’ve started making a list of things that I’m noticing whenever I decide to put my 2 weeks in. I’m currently trying to get pregnant so I’m trying to stay at least until I either have the kid and can use their maternity leave & look for a job then or until I finish my masters degree. I am just starting my masters so it will be about 2 years before I finish that.

How do you guys that work in a corporate setting handle white people who you just know that they don’t like you or show micro aggressions towards you in the workplace. This is 100% not a career for me, just a stepping stone. 

Thanks in advance. I’ll also answer any questions you guys have to give me context.

Update: I’m about to put in my 2 weeks Friday. I have some savings that will get me through the next 2 months to find another job and should get 2 more checks from here. I can’t do the fake passive aggressive act with this lady so I have to leave. I feel more relieved about my decision instead of stressed and that right there let’s me know I’m making the right move."

"1. *KEEP A PAPER TRAIL.* I write this in almost every comment to help requests lol. If you have a meeting over something important, send a recap right after. If she gets any idea of blaming you for something you didn't do, you'll have proof.
2. Make sure you have solid **quantitative** data for your performance reviews. It's not impossible to lie with numbers, *but it's harder*. If you receive praise from coworkers and other managers, note it as well.
3. Keep an eye on internal job postings to see if you can get an interim position under another manager.
4. This one is a bit tricky but...don't show all your cards. For example, if you are already efficient at 75%, don't go at 100% to show off. Use that remaining % for critical events. She may try to deter you from staying by making you overwork, which will be harder if she doesn't know the extent of your skills.

"The thing with ww is that you need to be mindful of any reputation smearing. It is a playbook, ive seen so many operate like this:

1.they dont like you for whatever reason (usually envy).
2. They will try to get other ppl on thier side to not like you
3. Theyll get one of thier friends to establish a relationship with you.  (ie gather info to gossip about you). Be very mindful of anyone she hangs out with or is buddy buddy with. Pay attention to who associates with whom.
4. Yt ppl care a lot about what others think so even if someone does like you, if she is able to get the majority to go against you that former ally will either join the other side or give you a cold shoulder bc the yts have a fear of being ostracized.
5. Your ostracized. Ironically, many ppl dont want folks they dont like to leave the company. They want ppl around they can bully.


If she is one of these types of yts (very social, charming, prone to cliques) and there are at least 2 other ppl on her side...its just a matter of time until your at step 5.

"Maybe other people can give better advice, but usually I've had to leave. 

Even just today for a job interview, this racist WW I was interviewing with didn't really want to interview with me and was claiming her Zoom didn't work/didn't hear me when I started speaking. She didn't even turn her camera on. Made me log in on my phone and when I could clearly hear myself from my phone on my Zoom she still acted as if she couldn't hear me. I knew she was lying and gaslighting me, but it's like they do that to mess with you/waste your time and it still gives them an out if you speak up about it. It kills part of your soul dealing with that day in and day out. On my better days, like today, I knew that I would not be getting that job. And I think I'm right on that because enter game #2: Any correct answer I gave to her questions, she'd find a way to say what I said was wrong or not what they were looking for, so I just answered her questions and tried to get off the phone as quick as I could. I told the recruiter about the ""issues"" she claimed she had but in a way to say I was ""concerned"" and just in case they were having technical issues I just wanted to let them know. Basically to cover my ass and to push back on this woman's gaslighting. And when that happens, if everyone else in the company isn't in cahoots with her BS, then they'll try to accommodate you and make sure you're treated well or they'll take their foot off your neck bc you're coming for their jobs too. It won't always be like that, bc if you see this WW has people on her side, you're fucked.

/Rant aside and tl;dr, you have to play their games back unfortunately and not let their gaslighting and games pull you under because that's what they want on top of getting you fired.

2. Actively network within the company.  This will give you allies in a fight and job hoping within the company will almost always be easier within the company than without

"I now use it as a litmus test with jobs. If they won't even turn on their camera to speak to me, it's an automatic no and I'll use that experience as practice. I actually was hired at a job where some of the interview panel (WW) wouldn't even turn their camera on and they were the main ones who were aggressive towards me in the actual job. They know what they're doing.

I was going to add this in an edit, but you'll need to learn. It took a lot of soul searching and self belief, but I lean into my ""soft, feminine"" southern upbringing and my mother's example. She NEVER kept her foot off of the terroristic WW teachers I had growing up or at her job; she knew how to report, complain and document like those WW. She used those same avenues that they would try to punish us for right tf back. You'll feel like a Karen, but that's who you're dealing with. And you are code switching; it doesn't matter if you came from the HOOD hood or if you came from the most suburban place on the planet. They do not want you to know your rights or assert them, which is why I believe they put up the smoke and mirrors with the 3D gaslighting, 3D passive aggression, sabotage and reputation destruction. My mom spoke and carried herself like Diahann Carroll (and the OG is my grandmother), had an insane vocabulary and was just as relentless and vocal about their terrible treatment/unprofessional behavior to the right people/avenues (that they believe ""only belonged to them"") as they were about harassing and bullying me. They were afraid of her. 

I thought for a long time I couldn't ever have that skill bc I didn't know how she did it, but I found out! If she could do it and my life/livelihood is on the line, then so can I. If Zora Neale Hurston said you must speak up about the injustice before they take your voice, then you must.

They are also banking on you getting ""aggressive"" with them and if you don't get aggressive with them, they want to mess with you mentally enough that (a) you don't say anything and (b) they blame you for ""poor performance"" or ""they just had to fire you."" No ma'am. The very last time I left a hostile yt work environment, it was a strategic move. This WW actually admitted on paper she was harassing me; she was boasting! And she was boasting bc that was her last ditch effort to get my attention bc I refused to acknowledge her behavior, but instead went above her and documented. And this is while my very yt team were all on the same side and emboldened her. Internally, it did take a toll on me mentally, but I had an admission in addition to my documentation that was a slam dunk for a lawyer and EEOC. I also met the very high threshold of ""hostile work environment"" for my state's unemployment office to receive benefits and I got an admission of guilt from the head of HR of that company. Them people could not say they didn't know AND that I was nothing but ""pleasant and nice"" to everyone.

Yep! It started with one in our first year  of grad school. We were in the same sub department and I don’t know if it was a culture difference (I’m an immigrant in the US) but I was not afraid to speak up in the department and her own advisor ended up becoming one of my champions. She hated me from then and started the same exclusion process with the students in the department. It fucked with my mental and I ended up shutting down, not speaking up, I made myself small so not to attract hers or her cliques attention. Luckily, in our third year, the department hired a Black professor. She was the first professor in the department who wasn’t white. She took me under her wing and slowly my confidence came back.

"i was just labeled ‘that weird female’ and it’s doing something to me. i shouldn’t care too much what people think of me, but this time i do. as of late i keep reflecting on what i may or may not have done that has steered me from finding a suitable partner. 

i understand clearly that the males i’ve been with are wayy beneath my standards, and were not the most useful way to spend my time. but being called weird is familiar to me. all throughout my childhood into new adult life, people have called me a weirdo. 

it’s almost traumatizing. and it reminds me that being autistic, living with bpd, and having severe anxiety makes me different from other people. it keeps me in this box. it instills this fear into me that being different the way i am will always repel people from wanting to be in my life. 

the whole reason the guy in question called me a weirdo is because my social anxiety made it hard to want to converse with him over the phone. he wrote it off as me ‘just being nervous.’ and insisted that i just go and ‘get help’ as if it’s that easy. 

men look at me and want to worship the ground i walk on, until they learn that i’m not the spitting image of what they wanted. i’m a ball of anxiety so i find it hard to engage in phone calls or make plans. i don’t tend to answering messages quickly (especially when they don’t rush to answer mine). i don’t allow myself to be spoken to any kind of way. and most of all, i will not step outside of my comfort zone for just anyone. 

things like this are why i keep to myself. life as a neurodivergent individual makes simple things more difficult than they have to be. having been labeled a ‘weirdo’ all my life has really gotten to me and puts me back into that dark place i tried to escape from."	gh0st-written	post	29.25749162107906	female	White	0.06817328184843063	na	na	na	3	blackladies

"I’m 27. I’ve been dating men since I was 17. I’ve had one 4-year relationship but aside from that, most of my time with men has been short flings that last anywhere between a 1 night stand to a 2 month fling where we might go on dates and have sex semi-regularly until eventually things naturally fizzle down or one of us loses interest in the other and stops contact. 

I’ve redownload Hinge and Tinder and I find it baffling how much men just don’t care. Like, I’ve had so many men whose first date suggestions include that we go on a walk and maybe they’ll bring a joint for us to smoke—-I never say yes to these dates, but just the fact that it’s something that’s being constantly offered as something I would be interested in is disheartening. Say what you will about men paying on the first date, but the least these guys could do is offer to buy me a happy hour cocktail, like for fucks sake they’re less than $10…

I want to believe that there are men out there who want to treat women to nice dates and get to know them before jumping into bed but I’m learning more and more that people like that are more rare to come by. 

Should I just accept that men are only here to fuck me and I shouldn’t expect anything more than that?

"Please don’t lower your expectations thinking you can use men like they use women for sex. This is not a comment to slut shame but to bring forth the reality of night stand/casual/hookup culture. 

Men can orgasm from penetrative sex alone and tend to become fatigued after reaching climax. Unless you have an attentive and generous partner who communicates and deliberately sets out to make you orgasm first, you will be left frustrated and used. 

Sexual chemistry can be intoxicating in text messages and conversations, but until you’re in the midst of it, you won’t know what type of lover the person truly is. 

I know too many women who were seduced by smooth talking, handsome men who couldn’t or wouldn’t acknowledge the clit. Foreplay nonexistent. 

No matter how many times they tried to communicate and tell the man what to do to ensure mutual satisfaction, majority of the men did not care. Sometimes the men would get aggressive in response. 

Engaging in this behavior can also dangerous for women. You’re meeting a stranger for sex. You risk physical harm, SA, STDs and pregnancy. From a man who probably doesn’t care because it was just sex and he still beat.

Hi, black man here (28, idk how I ended up here lol). No, i literally just had a similar convo with my male best friend yesterday. Get off those dating apps, it’s literally for people that Can’t pull someone in real life for one reason or another (anxiety, missing social cues, selfish, sociopathic, cheap, constant complainer, impatient, clingy, short-tempered, lying about their current life status, etc.). If you’re relatively normal and decent looking, just go get a hobby and naturally, guys will gravitate towards you. Stop worrying about being single, while you’re single (I know, easier said than done but trust me) because if you use that time to make yourself a more complete person, you’ll attract men who are looking for a relationship. Don’t be fooled by the “pretty people” that are serial-daters, they have issues in other places because they failed to spend that time with themselves developing in other ways. Put your head down, do the work on yourself, and before you know it, a good man will be knocking on your door. Hope that helps.	suresher	reply	na	na	na	0.9981516003608704	weak	strong	no	na	blackladies

"You seem to like using apps, so I’m just doubling down on switching from primarily using apps to seeking group settings that let you indulge in your favorite hobbies to meet people with similar interests. When I moved to a new area, I got a side gig at a cultural institution for play money. There were a lot of staff and volunteers that I became close friends with and had a few dating options. I ended up meeting my current boyfriend while I was there.

I hope this helps. By finding a place for you to enjoy your hobby/interests, people see you in your element and will be interested in engaging with you. If you have an open heart, while still holding true to your standards, you’ll find someone that will go above and beyond."	suresher	reply	na	na	na	0.9981516003608704	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

But do a search online and see if there are any for ur closest metropolitan area if u aren’t from a major city.

Also take into consideration where u wanna live. If u plan on moving cities for work, u may want to wait and start dating when u get in a stable career in the city of ur choice. Since it sounds like u want a steady, lifelong commitment u will need to think about the long game which may be shelving dating for now if, for instance u know ur open to moving elsewhere for a job in the next 6-12 months.

If you're open to suggestions from an old, married auntie, I would recommend:

1. Swipe left on *anyone* who mentions marijuana or any drug use in their profile. The types of people who make smoking their personality aren't the types of people that you should want in your life.

2. Add cultural interests like opera, classical music, chess/go, and ballet to your profile. This will put most losers off.

3. Increase the age minimum to 30 and lower the age max to 37. Twenty six is too young. Men at this age still have the mindset of teenagers. Men in their 40s looking for women  in their sub 30s have control issues."	suresher	reply	na	na	na	0.9981516003608704	strong	no	no	na	blackladies

"Hmm.  Going down memory lane today.  Very traumatizing experience. I have endometriosis and the doctors knew. For months while I was pregnant I was having this random, severe right flank pains.  It was horrible. I would be absolutely disabled and unable to breathe. To the ER I would go and they would run the same tests over and over again then pump me full of morphine and send me home. At some point I was afraid to go back to the dr because I felt like they assumed I was drug seeking.  It finally hit a head at 9 months when the pain was so bad I was projectile vomiting. I went to the ER and told the dr about my pain. She didn't even touch me. Immediately dismissed me as having sciatica, sent me home with tylenol and left the room.  I went home and cried all night, I even popped a vicodin and it didn't touch the pain.  I called the dr line and she yelled at me over the phone. I eventually went back to L&D where they made me wait overnight in pain for a doctor even though they had doctors on the floor.  I cried all night and all but one nurse was so rude to me.  My temperature was rising, my baby was in distress and I was starting to dilate. I rolled around in pain, a nurse came in and yelled at me for moving the band, she slammed my hand down to my side when I reached up to touch my belly.   Finally in the early am the doctor comes in saying it's appendicitis and they need to do a caesarian and appendectomy. I was terrified.  Turns out I had a rare condition called decidualized endometriosis.

My baby was ok. When I finally came to, the same doctor that dismissed me tried to come in and check on me. I just stared at her and she backed out of the room.  They all downplayed what really went on. They knew they fucked up but I was too wounded to fight back. I just wanted my baby. 

I believe my abuse came from me being in a relationship with an older white man.  What should have been a joyous birth is marred by the abuse at the hands of the ones that are supposed to heal and nurture. Even the lactation nurses were not kind. 

I have an appointment next week to talk to a doctor on that performed my hysto two years later. I asked for pictures and more detailed and got none. I have so many questions and got no answers, no apologies. I feel stronger and more confident now. 

I guess this a vent post honestly. I did eventually report the way I was treated but it was just a we'll do training type message and that was it. 

Moving to Kentucky was the worse mistake I could have made. Kentucky has not been kind to me since I've been here.

At no time during my pregnancy was I told how large my baby was measuring, so I thought everything was okay. I ended up pushing for 3+ hours before an emergency c-section. During pushing I knew something was wrong and at one point I even begged for a c-section but the doctor refused, stating that I wouldn’t want the recovery that comes with it. At one point she even told me to stop making noise as I was trying my hardest to push that I began screaming out of frustration.

"A friend of mine is moving and we decided to meet at a restaurant to celebrate and catch up. The restaurant was an hour away and when I finally got close, I got lost and called him. 

He didn’t answer, so I texted him, he still didn’t answer. 20 minutes went by and I finally found my way. He finally messaged back right when I pulled in. When I walked into the restaurant with a gift, he was talking to the waitress. He thanked me for the gift and the girl asked what was the celebration for. He began talking  about the new job and that started this very long winded conversation with the waitress. 

After a few minutes I began to feel awkward and like a third wheel. It felt rude to me. He said something along the lines that he’d come back home  to visit her and I just got the ick. If the waitress wouldn’t have left to check on another table, I truly think the conversation would’ve lasted longer. We began catching up and it was going fine, I made a joke about his flirting, hoping he’d get a hint on how uncomfortable it was making me feel, but then the waitress came back with my drink. He already had his and did a cheers, saying he was waiting for the waitress to come back to do it. She couldn’t drink of course, but just used a glass of water to cheers. 

She took our order and it once again, developed into this long conversation, this time about the food, but it was still some flirting going on. I went to the restroom and came back and the two were still talking. 
The girl was telling her whole life story and he was all intrigued. I didn’t know how to interrupt because I felt like the third wheel to a dinner  that’s supposed to be between me and my friend. After he asked for the girls Instagram handle and told her to follow him, I told him how he was doing the most. I said you’re leaving soon, why are you flirting so heavy with someone who you probably won’t see again like  this ? Plus, we’re in our early 30s. This waitress couldn’t have been older than 21. 

He started acting like he didn’t know what I was talking about, in a playful way. 
I never saw him act that way before. My friend is a black & the  waitress was white, and idk why that also annoyed me. I have no issue with inter- racial dating, but I felt like a black woman who was being ignored or thrown to the side, for a white woman.

He brought up race , saying he doesn’t have a type, but ultimately loves black women and will most likely end up with a black woman one day.

Despite how i felt in the moment, I wanted to ultimately celebrate & be there for him as he’s making a big transition in life with the move. So I didn’t say anything else. 

Our relationship is completely platonic & I don’t think I was  jealous. I just felt very hurt by the way I was treated by him. I know it wasn’t intentional, but I felt like his attention was focused elsewhere. It’s like he wasn’t completely present, because he was busy flirting every time the waitress came back.

Also, this friend has always told me to embrace my natural hair. I’ve worn weaves and wigs since I’ve known them & I wore my hair out for the first time when I saw him, he didn’t even comment or notice because of how  focused he was on the waitress.

Am I wrong for getting upset by this ?

Edit :
Also I forgot to note how I live 5 hours away from my hometown now. I had plans to be in town already, but when I found out about his new move, I wanted to celebrate with him. He couldn’t meet until Sunday and I needed to drive back and planned on doing it after eating. So him taking up time talking to a waitress, instead of focusing on the two of us , felt disrespectful to me of my time."	yuckyblucky197	post	20.021712271048564	female	White	0.9993709921836853	na	na	na	51	blackladies
The title doesn’t do you justice. You’re not mad about him flirting, you’re mad because he was being a dick about it and ignoring you. He disrespected your time and energy by spending the entire time you were supposed to spend together entertaining someone else. Both of them were rude and the waitress is unprofessional. Him being in his 30s makes this worse. I do agree that there may be something he was pressed about, but even then, that is an extremely petty way to express that.	yuckyblucky197	reply	na	na	na	0.9993709921836853	no	no	no	na	blackladies
"I feel like it is more the ignoring. I personally don't think there is anything wrong with a friend flirting, but if they are just ignoring you the whole time, what's the point? Also him not answering and telling you he was going to be late is disrespectful. Don't joke about it, tell him how you felt ignored. If he is a good friend he would listen to that. 

Also if you friends flirting is a boundary of yours also communicate that.

I do think there seems to see some insecurities coming from your side. Since it resulted in you comparing yourself to white women

"You’re not wrong. And although you don’t have a problem with interracial relationships, it makes sense that you felt slighted in the presence of a male friend flirting with someone of a different race after he told you to embrace your natural beauty. Any insecurities you might have about your appearance would feel validated after that encounter.  

And waiting for the waitress before he made the toast would’ve been the straw that broke the camel’s back for me.  I simply would’ve told them that, “Although I came all this way to celebrate you, I see that you’re good and I know when I’m a third wheel.  Enjoy your meal.

"I think you think more of this friendship than he does. If he was really vibing with the waitress he could have easily gone back inside and asked her for her contact info after you guys finished. Instead, he spent time that he should have dedicated to you (a friend and someone who made the effort to meet with him before a long drive) flirting with her. 

And I kinda understand why it would irk you that this was all over white woman, even if the friendship was platonic. I would feel like “really? All of a sudden my time is worthless? Is it *that* serious?” *Some* black men see an opening with a white/ white adjacent woman and they lose all sense. That could part of the reason he lost respect for your time on a dime.

he’s a jerk, period. that would have annoyed me too. and her being white definitely makes it more irksome, mainly bc most of them already feel so above us, and him displaying that type of behavior ignoring you while y’all are out together, and prioritizing her, probably just confirmed her superiority complex. black men are just….. ugh.	yuckyblucky197	reply	na	na	na	0.9993709921836853	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
I feel like why are you so bothered with him flirting? Unless there’s potential on either side, I wouldn’t be bothered. I’ve watched my friends flirt many times with other individuals.

I think that he was wrong for entertaining her for so long. He could’ve simply got the number and called her later. Overall I feel like he was being a little petty for reasons unknown. 👀 If this is a good friend you both need to have a conversation. He’s bothered and obviously wanted you to know it and you felt disrespected and like he wasn’t present. These type of things build resentment, are serious and can destroy a friendship.

"I'll keep saying this until I get tide, but (most) men don't view things the same way as women do. The bottom line is he disrespected your time. All the other stuff about the waitress is moot\*

For a situation like this, I also would've gotten up and left in a very obvious way after the first time he ignored me. He would not waste my time like that again. Since it was an hour away, I would've made it into a day trip for myself. They only respond to consequences and embarrassment because they compute on respect, you feel me? There's no amount of communication or fake apologies that would correct that behavior. It was deliberate.

\*And I understand the jealousy side with the WW and giving her attention. If she was just run of the mill rude and not giving you the Entitled Becky Treatment (TM), please swerve. Some guys like your friend are just dogs and they get off on knowing (or making you feel) you're insecure like that. It's an ego stroke to them. This chick is working in a restaurant in some random town. What do you do for a living? Obviously something to buy him a nice gift.

OP I think the flirting bothered you a bit because you felt the event was important but the level of importance wasn’t the same for him. Kind of like your sense of urgency wasn’t being matched. In your mind this event was more about you giving him a big send off and he was just having dinner with a friend before leaving town. 

Who he flirts with- that’s his deal and as long as you aren’t dating him and he’s not flirting with a literal child…meh.

Not necessarily. This friend has told me to wear/ embrace  my natural hair before on different occasions since I’ve known him, after he saw a picture of my hair. I guess I was expecting him to say something, being that it was my first time wearing it out like that. While this doesn’t have anything to do with him at all, wearing my hair out is a big deal to me. I was always ashamed and never felt comfortable wearing it out, so it was a big deal for me to just go to dinner with it like that. Even one of my relatives had asked if he said anything about my hair because they know he’s brought it up before, but he didn’t. I guess I was just expecting something to be said. I do feel like if this was female friend , I would’ve been equally upset. Giving your attention to someone or something else while at dinner, just annoys me.

If this is the first time this has happened, I’d reach out and let him know how his behavior came across.

Ahhh I see! I remember reading that one too but sorry for my misunderstanding. If its truly a valued friend I'd say just talk to them about how it made you feel. That's where it should always start. Your feelings are 100% understandable especially after not responding to your attempts to celebrate their success. They finally have time and they hardly acknowledge you after you get together. It's a bad feeling. Sorry, I don't have advice for something like this other than just talking to them about exactly how it made you feel and why.	yuckyblucky197	reply	na	na	na	0.9993709921836853	strong	strong	no	na	blackladies
"So I’m 25, been single all my life never really had a guy whom I liked properly like me back. At first, I didn’t care because I was busy with school and learning about myself. But now, as a working woman with an otherwise very great life,  I’m struggling with it.

Yes I have friends, yes I have hobbies and a very full life but I’m beginning to think there is something wrong with me. Why has no guy I’m interested in ever been interested in me? 

I work out, I dress nicely, I treat people well, I take care of my appearance. I do everything a woman is “meant to do”. I get along with people and have had men interested in me etc. (these are good guys btw but there was no sexual attraction in my end)

I’m beginning to feel very bitter, despite being a generally happy person. I love my friends but I can’t cuddle and have sex with them after a stressful day at work. Its just not the same and I’m beginning to resent this. I want that butterfly feeling of being in love and having someone love you back.

I’ve tried online dating but I hate it, if you’re not racially ambiguous or a white woman, just forget about having a good experience. It fills me with anxiety every time a conversation starts of well and the guy ghosts or unmatches me. People say rejection is not personal, but a person saying “I don’t want YOU” sounds very personal to me.

"My one and only serious, healthy relationship (so far) started when I was 26.

Now, to be fair, I haven’t actually tried dating since I’ve been single but it was rough from 18-26. Talking that went nowhere. First dates that went nowhere. Situationships that went nowhere.

I crave romance so I’m sure I’ll open myself to dating again, but I definitely understand how hard it is when you haven’t experienced it. It is way easier to deal with now because it’s happened already.

The worst thing to do is to latch on to the first option that seems viable. Luckily, I continued to date others during that time, but still it did a number on me.

I would say be intentional about dating. What are you looking for specifically in a partner and how they would fit in with the goals you have for your life.

I feel people don’t talk enough about how relationships are work. The media, including social media, makes it seem like things will just fall into place. Even dating someone with whom you have a strong friendship is a challenge. But even so, it’s worth it if you have a desire for romance and/or sex."

"I’m terms of dating online I really think it depends on where you are. I live in a predominantly black area so regardless of what anyone says there are men out there who like dark skin black women. I’d say make sure your profile isn’t lack luster. You’ve got to put a bit more effort into it as a black woman😅 I’m a bit younger, but ppl are shit and ghost each other. I’ve done it before too. It’s literally just a numbers game. You can’t just give up after people ghost. 

But really, you should continue to fill your time with your hobbies and work. I know you said you work out but I find that going to the gym or going on a run fills my thoughts. You have to love who you are alone; and love yourself in a way that no man or woman can. I know that’s easier said than done but hey there’s a chance you may find someone and there’s a chance you may not. It’s a hard pill that I feel everyone should have to swallow. Then again you deserve more than this feeling of loneliness. You deserve love. If no one else is there to give it to you, the least you can do is give it to yourself. 

I think you’ll find someone. There’s billions of men around the world. It just takes time. People move at different paces. Ignore those happy relationships you see online, because you don’t know what’s going on behind closed doors. Trust me, more people are unhappy than they seem. The cuddling and sex comes with a lot more baggage than people will tell you. Girl, you got this. 

Also, rom coms, media, and novels are a big help as well. Maybe not in the traditional sense but it helps fill that void of being alone. Set goals, travel when you can, get an pet to take care of. We only get to live this life once & it’s up to you to make the best out of that. Again, easy for me to say but it’s not like you’re on your deathbed.

"Have to date for compatibility in personality and long term goals. Focus heavily on religion, politics, and mutual hobbies (not solely good looks cause its a scam if youre still polar opposite). Yea be attracted but dont date a guy for only that reason. If you can't do interracial dating it may be best to move to a more diverse area. Also if you like sexually dominant men or sexually submissive men, be forward about that.

If youre going to date based on meeting in public, you have to frequent places that increase those opportunities. Most people psyche themselves out by waiting for someone to fall in their lap. They have to actually see you for that to happen, and you have to take care of your appearance.

Focusing on the wrong qualities can lead to self sabotage. And not putting yoursekf out there or dating around can limit your dating experience. Date for the experience not just the man.

Not committing and not marrying until you’ve seen all that you need see to take the next step. Keep it light for now. So often, we let the man dictate the speed of the relationship. Taking back this power, particularly for you, will be very invigorating.

"I’m 32 and I’m kinda dealing with the same thing. The struggle is real out here! I’ve been in 4 relationships through my adult life. The men my age are extremely immature. Some people do not mature with age at all. Dating in your 30’s is hard!

Ironically, I’ve been seeing a shift in the men who match with me on dating apps lately. There have been more younger guys matching with me. I’m 32, but I don’t look 32. I’m a very youthful person and I can see why a younger guy would like that. The irony is, they seem to know exactly what they want more than the older ones do. How crazy is that! I’m currently dating someone much younger than me, and I never thought I would do that. I’m glad I gave him a chance! I was going to reject him based on his young age at first, but once I got to know him I saw that he was a good guy. 

Sometimes you might have to step outside of your comfort zone and try something different to get a different result. Good people do find each other! We just gotta search harder to find each other.

This probably isn't the case.   I would bet money that there are plenty of guys who do/have find/found you attractive, but whether they make the decision to act on such feelings is a crucial, yet completely separate issue.  I don't know you, so I have no idea what kind of vibe/impression/energy you give off but there are some situations/contexts where extra effort is needed to make oneself seem approachable (but not thirsty... it is a fine line to walk).   If you're 25, then its a pretty good bet that many of your male acquaintances who freely give you their attention and time probably have at least some interest.

>I work out, I dress nicely, I treat people well, I take care of my appearance. I do everything a woman is “meant to do”. I get along with people and have had men interested in me etc. (these are good guys btw but there was no sexual attraction in my end)

&#x200B;

This is a can of worms that leads down a deep, dark rabbit hole.   Suffice it to say that women as a group, when roused to pursue a male, tend to chase the same minority of men.  I have seen it with my own eyes.   I don't know what kind of guy turns you on, but if its the 6+ ft, tall, handsome type then these kinds of guys have all sorts of choices... so you'll either have to get lucky or get in line to have your shot at attracting them.    I have no useful advice if you are pursuing this small population of highly sought out males.

>I’m beginning to feel very bitter, despite being a generally happy person. I love my friends but I can’t cuddle and have sex with them after a stressful day at work.

&#x200B;

You're conflating sexual attraction, companionship and romance.   Yes, we look for all three when seeking out a partner, but its rare to find someone who is an ideal match in all three categories.   I totally understand feeling like you're only living 2/3 of your life day to day because of the yearning for that type of connection.  I lived that way for years.    If a solution isn't presenting itself spontaneously then you need to go out and work for it.  Are you?

>I’ve tried online dating but I hate it, if you’re not racially ambiguous or a white woman, just forget about having a good experience. It fills me with anxiety every time a conversation starts of well and the guy ghosts or unmatches me.

Online dating sucks for most people.   Online dating is really ""online introductions"".  It should be a small part of your strategy for getting out and meeting eligible potential partners.   Focus on building a social network and putting yourself in situations where you have the opportunity to encounter potential dateable folk, or the close acquaintances of potential dateable folk.   This means occasional, but regular getting our of your standard routine.

Online dating will let you down 95% of the time, and I would treat it like the type of endeavor that is extremely unlikely to bear fruit.  That being said, what kind of guys are ghosting you?  Is it the super desirable ones?

"Dating unfortunately is a numbers game. 

I feel like also we are sold a myth of this butterfly feeling of being in love and unconditional love when that really isn't a thing in real life. I think you may need to redefine what you want to look like in reality because even those long lasting relationships don't always start with a love connection. When I first met my boyfriend, I didn't even like him. He was an oversharer and while I did see positive traits ... he overshared so much that I was turned off. My friend told me to go on a few more dates and I'm glad she did because we are going on 3 years next year. 

I'd give online dating another chance and if you aren't going on a date within a week or 2 ... you should be unmatching because they aren't interested in going on a date with you. Anyone that is looking for an actual relationship will actually ask you out rather fast. If it's not too much, where do you live and what kinda guys are you interested in? I'd be open to at least talking to guys that you may not be initially attracted to because some people just photograph terrible (my bf being one of them but he is very handsome) and sometimes the spark will come in person. I'm never attracted to people without an actual convo because I can't base everything off looks ... I always remember some telling me that  at the end the day you are stuck with personality. I've dated a few hotties that really made me question my intelligence because they were damn near slow.

I’m pretty sure people do say this to men..lol. It’s okay to be frustrated, but complaining about something and refusing to actually do anything about it isn’t going to change anything. If the guys you like don’t like you, you have either two options. That’s to make yourself more attractive (i.e, change yourself) to your preferences standards, or start dating guys who aren’t usually your type. It doesn’t get anymore complicated than that..

"I think u misunderstood where I’m coming from. I’m not trying to say ur a pick-me. It sounds like the conundrum of the “nice guy” for example, who the general public thinks is not nice at all b/c he acts as if he deserves something by being nice. 

I’m not trying to be mean when I say that treating people well, being fit, friendly, and pretty doesn’t mean ur owed a partner. Maybe on a conscious level u don’t think that. But subconsciously, that’s what that line of thinking implies. And ur post says that this dissonance between having what u think should get u a man vs the reality of the situation is making u bitter. That’s just my interpretation of what u posted.

Again, I’m not saying ur a bad person. I’m just saying the age-old adages of, “love will find u when it’s ready” or “rejection is God’s protection”may apply here.

My main advice is still find another dating pool. The guys on the apps aren’t it, as u have mentioned. Maybe ur current circle of friends don’t have a guy ur age to introduce u to. So go find it. Mix up your activities. Find new groups of people your age. It only ups your chances."	Africanaissues	reply	na	na	na	0.9986139535903931	no	no	no	na	blackladies

"I’m interested in guys who are similar to me, corporate types, seem active, introverted but with a good personality.

The last guy that was interested in me but I wasn’t feeling it was because he didn’t take his physical fitness seriously and wasn’t as ambitious as I was. Even though we got along, those qualities were important to me and I couldn’t change him. He didn’t understand why I enjoyed working a lot and ate in proportion. 

The last guy I was interested in seemed to get with a girl that had similar character traits like me but she had much bigger boobs and ass (I don’t)

Another guy I was interested in, got with a similar kind of girl but was notably shorter than me.

"This is my natural hair in short after blow drying it straight in hair salons , I tried learning how to do it by my own but I just can never do it perfectly so I have to go to hairdressers, believe it or not it’s been anxious nightmares through all these years different people telling me wtf I should do to my hair it’s like the following :

Black hairdresser thanks to them they burned my scalp and fkin aggressive with my hair , one of them legit burned my damn ear with heat not that was enough she burned my scalp and it was bleeding 

Arab hairdresser complained and sighing loudly when they saw my hair and telling me it’s too much and that I should do keratin aka hair relaxer which I end up doing it , it was a fkin tragic to my hair it used to be much longer and thicker than this in the photos and now I suffer from hair shedding like crazy 

White hairdresser I couldn’t believe it but they were the best with treating me and my hair , they never hurt me or make stupid comments even tho sometimes I feel they just talk shit underneath, idk lol

It’s sucks to say that but I legit developed self loathing towards my hair and I just wanna shave it all but I can’t cuz my mama would beat my ass lol

I might be too sensitive but I legit developed anxiety going to salons , I barely do my hair in salons anymore I only do it on in special occasions , anyone going through the same ?"	idkdidksuus	post	19.486364905425017	female	White	0.9869912266731262	na	na	na	17	blackladies

"A keratin treatment is not the same as a relaxer. 

I got relaxers for years, then I stopped. Then I started getting keratin treatments. 

Entirely different results, my hair is easier to style, takes less time to dry and it looks and feels better when straight and curly. 

It also keeps its style for longer. 

Relaxer breaks the bonds in your hair and then trains the hair to be straight. 

Keratin treatment is more similar to an intense protein treatment.

I mostly wear my hair in twists and updos. My hairstylist is big on natural hair but is also good at silk presses.

"For me it actually improved my curls. 

I spoiled myself and got a blowout when my shoulder was injured and it’s still swishy and smooth nearly a month later. 

That’s because of the protein treatment. Before that I’d get maybe a week out of a blowout. 

Also, my curls are at their best 2 washes after a keratin treatment. Just way better curl clumping, shine, bounce and drying time.

"Comparison can certainly be the thief of joy, but I can’t help but notice the number of posts about concerns about BW attractiveness. 

When I reflect on my life, I think about the fact that when I was younger (middle and high school) I didn’t really think about my level of attractiveness. I never got a whole lot of attention. I went to a mostly white school with maybe 15 black kids in my grade, about half boys and half girls. A few of the black boys had romantic interest in me, all of which I turned down. My female friends sometimes took jabs at me and acted like I was the “ugly friend”. For example, one friend once said to me “you’ll like this picture because you look better than me here for once”. I never thought “oh I’m uglier than this friend or I’m prettier than this friend” at the age. When I went to college, some of the high school friends I kept in touch with continued to treat me like I was undesirable and expressed frustration with the men I “could pull” when I decided to start dating. Saying “where do you find these men? You’re on different apps? I don’t find men like that because XYZ.”

I remember going to the club once before I started dating(dressed basically like I was running to the grocery store trying not to be seen🙈) and nobody approaching me, but plenty of people approaching the two new friends I was with. Obviously when you’re in this position you notice it and feel a little undesirable. 

As I figured out my style I got approached a lot more often. And the few times I’ve gone to the club since, there’s been multiple people to come up to me. Obviously male attention is not the most useful or important measure of attractiveness, but I’m emphasizing it in the context of this post because it’s such a large part of life as a young single woman and it is talked about a lot in this sub. 

Over the years, I developed friendships with different people from the ones in high school and those friends don’t treat me like the ugly friend. When we go out they’ll point out people looking at me or talk about people approaching me or finding me attractive as an expectation they have.

Even at this age I don’t explicitly think “I’m prettier than this friend or uglier than this friend”. I think I see it in terms of when we date, what kind of men will be into them. I don’t doubt any of my friends will attract men, I just know their look will attract different types and quantities of men. My friends and I joked recently “we’ll never fight over a man” because our types are so different. They think the men I like are ugly and I think the men they like are ugly but we are supportive nonetheless. I suppose comparison would be stronger if we were attracted to the same type of man.

I also have a certain “type” of woman that I am attracted to and aspire to be like. And not all of my friends aspire to that same archetype. 

I guess I’ve been the ugly friend and the pretty friend, which I value cause I can see both sides of it. 

I’m curious about other peoples experiences with viewing their attractiveness against their friends."	MolassesSubstantial1	post	25.841986952339997	male	White	0.0036528664641082287	na	na	na	8	blackladies
"Nope, I can’t say I’ve ever compared my friends’ attractiveness ever. I know that they’re pretty and compliment them, but I don’t compare between friends, or have a ranking, or see us as “competitors” for men (which is a deeply unhealthy mindset anyway).

But like you said, my friends are usually into men that I don’t find attractive and vice versa. I don’t really care when they get approached because the man approaching is never my type. That may have something to do with it.

EDIT: You said when you figured out your style, you got approached more. Got any personal style tips for a sister?

"I used to compare myself to my female friends’ attractiveness a lot growing up. Not in a sense of obtaining male attention and validation for romance. But because the men that I encountered growing up treated me less than or not worthy of basic human respect simply because they didn’t find me attractive. 

I would treat people how I’d like to be treated: like a human. Whereas they would either ignore or be flat out disrespectful towards me. Side eyes, mean mugging and roasting me for existing in the same room as them. But when someone they deemed attractive came in, their tone would switch up. 

I just wanted to be seen, heard, and told that my passions meant just as much as other peoples’. The lack of this is what lowered my self-esteem, not other beautiful women. 

As a teen, I didn’t fully understand that the fault landed on the man and not the attractive woman. Instead, I leaned into the already competitive and sexism culture. I’m disappointed in how I acted back then and if I could apologize to all the women I was rude to, I would. I have done so with those I have been able to get in touch with. 

I no longer compare myself to the attractiveness of others. I still work on my skincare and style because I want to look good. If someone doesn’t give me basic human respect and decency, I return the energy. This has offended several people but it is what it is."

"I have in the past because I was objectively less attractive than them and it was hard not to notice, but they never once made me feel that way. It was hard not to notice that I was the only one without a boyfriend. But it didn’t really affect me mentally or anything, I was quite oblivious about my looks until around 16 which I’m happy about. I just didn’t make the connection that if I looked better I would get more attention lol. My friends have never once made any snide comments or anything to suggest I’m the ugly friend, if anything I think they’ve got love goggles on and see me as more attractive than I really am, bless their cotton socks.  

I think objectively I’m less attractive than most if not all my friends but it doesn’t really bother me. If anything I’m just happy to be here cos I get the perks of their pretty privilege lol.

"I did up until my mid-20s and for the same reasons and in the same circumstances as you. I would get complimented as pretty or cute, and I did know that after I had my first glow up in middle school. But the thing was, I was just not white and I didn’t understand that I would be looked down on bc there were other girls (even my own friends) that would use that as a crutch when a guy they liked liked me or if I got more male attention than they did/felt they should have compared to me. I had some friends who would make comments saying that they knew I was pretty too or that I had confidence in myself but there was just an air of they deserved more attention/opportunity than me bc they were yt. And I would even feed into the looks thing when I would tell my friends “well I wouldn’t be your friend if you were ugly” bc that’s cute lmao

When I had another glow up right after high school, I was the pretty friend, but then I was targeted for other insecurities I had AND was still treated as less desirable/not taken seriously bc I wasn’t yt. That was really frustrating and painful. A few years ago, I stopped centering myself on male validation and I’ve been around the block too many times with the race issue to know when a dude thinks he values me lower bc of the color of my skin. But also recently I stopped centering my worth around or for other women too. Many women compare and compete with their friends. Some argue that’s it’s in women’s nature to do so. I stay away from women who overly do that bc it can get dangerous. I don’t compare attractiveness anymore and haven’t for some time as I’d like to spend time with people I enjoy. Some of the most rotten people can come in very nice looking, very average and very ugly packages, just like the some of the most wonderful people can look any kind of way too. You just never know.

Exploring personal style is a lot of fun and I’m glad you’ve been able to do that. I take it as a way to celebrate my body and my interests.

"Honestly I think finding a style I was confident in made me feel sexier and emit a better vibe that attracted men to me.

I’ve always gravitated towards a more professional wardrobe. I enjoy clothes that are well-fitted (moreso tailored), not tight. I don’t show too much bust or butt. Some places I’ve been buying from are RE ONA (Black owned), Everlane, Banana Republic, White House Black Market. My closet is monotone. I wear mostly black, white, tan. It sounds boring, but when the clothes fit you so well and accentuate your body well you get noticed for your class. I’ve had multiple people stop me on the street and tell me how elegant or classy I look. Because I love that style, though I may be overdressed at times, I LOOK confident. I walk with my chest up etc. and I think that has more to do with my attractiveness than what I wear. 

Another thing I like that adds to my sensuality (but nobody knows about) is what I wear under my clothes. I have a nice collection of lingerie. It’s like walking around with a secret. 

Edit: single or not, taking off an outfit at the end of the day and admiring the way lingerie looks on me is sensual. When I am dating someone and I dress like that under my clothes it’s like a secret only they know about. When I’m on dates with my man I’ll slowly whisper into his ear and describe what I’m wearing under my outfit while caressing his leg (not very visible or for long). It can be the start of foreplay for when you are in a relationship. 

In addition, when I actually am in the mood to flirt with men (which I rarely am), I’m very good at it. You look them deep in their eyes with the “sexy eyes” while you’re talking to them. Turn your head and smile when they say stuff, speak deeply and slowly. Don’t make the flirtation completely obvious, make them question it a little. That sucks them in. Men I’ve dated have noted that sometimes my very proper exterior makes them surprised by how I am in bed.  

But again, this is all only useful if you have the same kind of style as me. Confidence is the best attire. There’s women who wear outfits I would never wear but I am “attracted” to them because of their confidence"	MolassesSubstantial1	follow-up	na	na	na	0.0036528664641082287	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

Ohh I like it a lot. It’s probably the only the state I’ve lived in and never experienced racism in it. I will say it’s a lot poorer than the surrounding states so I wouldn’t move here without a job in place. They do have issues with drugs and homelessness but every city in America has that problem. The drivers are absolutely nuts. Lol The food scene is really good in New Mexico. It’s not a lot to do if you like a night life but the outdoors are top notch. They wear their culture on their sleeve, it’s a mixture of African American cowboys, Mexican, Spanish, American, & indigenous. They are also very sarcastic and love to crack jokes. They have pow-wows and you can find archaeological sites dating back to 1000 AD or so. The allergies are no joke in New Mexico and the weather is moody.

You’re black and plus sized. The general male demographic in Denver prefers white and thin (and even those girls have a very tough time according to friends and social media). The plus size part will be the bigger hurdle than being black but it’s a pretty bad city for the combo.	IGetWhatIWant333	reply	na	na	na	0.0017012051539495587	no	no	no	na	blackladies

"Well damn girl, don’t hold back lol.

Denver is very white and thin but you never know what can happen anywhere. Plus you’re young. Date if you want or don’t. It’s not a requirement. Enjoy the city for as long as you want to and if you love it, stay, live it up and if you don’t, leave and find yourself and love elsewhere! I always tell people when you move to a new a city, try to give it 1-2 years even if you’re crazy homesick. It takes a minimum of 1-3 years in most cities to settle so don’t give up when it feels tough. Enjoy the city!"	IGetWhatIWant333	reply	na	na	na	0.0017012051539495587	weak	no	no	na	blackladies

"Hello, Beautiful! 

I made a banana pudding pie and thought to post the recipe here for y’all to enjoy! This pie is thick, comforting, and really delicious. This recipe is also super easy and fun to make! Growing up my great-granny’s goldfish used to make this-

Just playing, haha. Here’s the recipe tested and adjusted. So my dessert pictured won’t reflect how  this recipe turns out, but the method is the same so no worries! These changes make the dessert something special. I recommend having a stand mixer to make your life much easier! Trust. 

———

1 pkg. Butter Cookies (Chessmen FTW) 
1 pkg. Bischoff Cookies 

4-6 Bananas Sliced
3/4 c. Caramel of Choice ⬇️
*Salted for depth, Regular for sweetness*

1-12oz. tub of Cool Whip 
1-14oz. can of Condensed Milk 
8oz block of Cream Cheese, softened. 
2 c. Milk. I used Whole Milk. 
1/4 cup Butter, melted

1 pkg. Banana Cream (rec.) or Vanilla Pudding Mix
1 tsp. Vanilla Extract 
2 tsp. Sweetener of choice

Optional: 

1/2 tsp. Almond Extract (Optional) 
1/2 c. Chopped and Toasted Walnuts or Pecans. Or chocolate, even. I like Dark. 

———

1️⃣ Crush Cookies Separately. Butter Cookies are for the base and Bischoff Cookies are for the crumb layers. Put the crushed Bischoff aside. Slice bananas.

2️⃣ Melt butter and combine with the crushed Butter Cookies. This is your crust. You may add sweetener to the mixture now if you’d like. Combine and set aside. 

3️⃣ Lightly grease and fill a spring-pan (or any round pan) with the crust mixture. Flatten crust until smooth and tight, freeze for 15–20 min. Add a layer of sliced banana, nuts or chocolate (optional) and caramel to the bottom of pan. Freeze again while prepping pudding mixture. 

4️⃣ Combine cream cheese, condensed milk and vanilla/almond extract until smooth. Pour in milk a cup at a time and mix until well-combined. 

5️⃣ Add pudding mix. Continue mixing for 4-5 minutes, medium speed. Scrape bottom of bowl halfway through and continue mixing until that pudding is thicc! 

6️⃣ FOLD! In whipped topping. Cannot stress enough that this is the most important step in ensuring that the mixture is thick and smooth, like our legs. So take your time and fold until the mixture is uniform in color. If you lose the air from your mixture, don’t worry! Just fold it again 😊

7️⃣ Remove the pan from the freezer and layer: pudding, crushed Bischoff, banana, nuts/chocolate (optional) and caramel. Repeat these layers until the pan is filled. You may have leftover banana pudding mixture. 

*I made parfaits with mine and they were delicious, but in a jar it would be a great gift!* 

8️⃣ Decorate the top of your pudding pie all pretty like and freeze for 2-3 hours or until the pudding is set. Doesn’t have to be hard. 

9️⃣ Slice and enjoy! Makes 8-12 servings depending on how you slice it. Either way; it’s not lasting long. 

🤎♥️🖤


Notes: 

I found that the Bischoff in the crust was a little too sweet for my preference. Using Bischoff in the crumb layers balances the flavors more, allowing the 🍌 to shine! But use whatever based on YOUR liking! 

Additionally, if using regular caramel I would recommend a pinch of sea salt on top of the finished dessert. Although not required, it helps round the sweetness of store-brought caramel while not being as decadent as using salted caramel throughout."	izayyee	post	27.181048969178438	female	White	0.00117305270396173	na	na	na	16	blackladies

"I didn’t think to use yogurt! But I do see that working: try a vanilla based whole-milk or Greek yogurt. You can also get some heavy whipping cream and make your own whipped cream to your tastes! So Cool whip can be substituted for sure! 

O m g the candy would be so good, esp. since they’re a lil salty mm. I used dark chocolate because I was afraid of using candy for my first attempt, but now I’ll need to make one with Butterfingers. My boo would love it.

Okay so I’m not saying this to start diaspora wars but I genuinely want to know why and what do Caribbean’s and Africans get out of asking AA “Where are you really from” knowing the history of slavery. This happened at work so I couldn’t respond the way I would have liked but the convo went like this

Him:Hi

Me: Hey how are you.

Him: Great where are you from. 

Me: I’m from Mississippi 

Him: Where do you think your from

Me:  Mississippi (knowing what he was getting at)

Him: Oh so you’re NATIVE to here.

Me: No I grew up in Mississippi 

(By this point I think he could tell by my responses that I didn’t want to continue this conversation but he continued)
Him: So you really think you’re from Mississippi you don’t believe you’re from the Caribbean or Africa. Where do you believe your from?

Me: I mean probably somewhere in Africa on the west coast but idk I grew up in Mississippi. (Not about to claim somewhere I never been nor know nothing about)

Him: Mmhmmm okay we’ll me and my family are Jamaican but we’re from Canada 
(😒can anyone else hear my eye twitching)

Me: That’s nice

Then there was this VERY awkward silence as I stood there staring at him and his family. Then he proceeded to dryly ask me about my career plans which I answered enthusiastically😂
But I feel like what’s the point of asking this type of stuff knowing our history. You can be a Jamaican from Canada but I can’t just be a black American from Mississippi I just feel like it’s so disingenuous. Let’s just say I was to take an ancestry test. And I’m like 70% Nigerian then I try to learn the culture and history I will NEVER be accepted as a Nigerian because I didn’t grow up there, I’m generations removed so what’s the point. I just feel like that’s the whitest thing you can ask somebody. And it really pissed me off because I couldn’t respond the way I wanted. I see these types of videos all on the internet and podcasts but never in my life would I think it would happen to me. What do y’all get out of asking AA this? I told my Haitian friend what happened and she just cringed the entire story😂 and went on a lil rant about Caribbean men. Again I don’t do the whole diaspora wars because quite honestly I see every black person as black regardless of where you’re from not saying that as an erasure of your culture or nationality but you get the point. I couldn’t really walk away nor respond sarcastically because my job is very big on pleasing clients so I felt soooo trapped.

Edit: I tried to separate the conversation so it would be easier to read but reddit won’t let me be great. Also ignore any typos pls🫣"	International_Key949	post	19.593380801828456	female	White	0.9993215799331665	na	na	na	84	blackladies

I think it’s part of the whole “AAs have no culture/true roots” bull where people have a big urge to pull at our leg of all people in the diaspora. I remember my mom getting fed up at this question and just saying “America. I’m American 🇺🇸” lmao. She stopped trying to prove any point via breaking down any percentages, because it IS a point. Because we’ve been here for hundreds of years, made our own (viral) culture detached from whichever very distant tribes we came from, and have lots of history here to be proud of that goes further than even some white groups of people here who didn’t come here till migrating in the 1900s, and have movements to be proud of that still aid us AND OTHERS in this regressing ass country we built till this day lol. So what’s wrong with accepting “I’m from America/I’m from Illinois/ I’m from Mississippi” if that’s where her family’s been for generations? Miss her with that “where are you REALLY from/you don’t know your true identity” shit lmao.

There was this one guy who could not wrap his head around that my parents and grandparents were all New Yorkers and I don't claim any Caribbean heritage. Lots of people do, but clearly not all.

But seriously, I get so irritated when I see black people from other countries who can trace their ancestry to, um let’s say “non-forced immigration.” That’s great that you’re Nigerian British or whatever but the best I can do with my history is tell you that my family was enslaved in the 1860s."

"I am comfortable getting these people together. These people are not idiots... They know that the majority of black people in the United States of America are descendants of US slaves and not of immigrant descent! 

They're only saying this for two reasons...

1) Either it's because they see you in a position of power and understand that Black American descendants of U.S. slaves don't often find themselves in positions of power because we continue to bear the lasting cost of 246 years of U.S. Slavery immediately followed by 100 years of Jim Crow which has gutted as socieoeconomically speaking and stifled our ability to be upwardly mobile while they (blacks of immigrant descent) have been able to literally tiptoe around our multi-generational lineage-based polite in the U.S. all while still benefiting from all of the affirmative action/""diversity, equity and inclusion""-type policies that were meant to be forms of redress specifically for u. black American US slave descended people

2) They are trying to remind you of who you are because either putting Black American US slave descended people down is a maladaptive coping mechanism that they use to make themselves feel better about who they or they are just elitist and REALLY DO look down on you for coming from Blacks enslaved in the U.S.

Either way, here is how you handle it....

To Blacks Of Caribbean & Latin ancestry say

""Oh, I'm a Black American descendant of U.S. slaves. My family has been in America since the 1700s.... probably just as long, if not longer than your family has been in your homeland. I know YOU'RE an immigrant in America but you can't assume that every Black person in America is of immigrant descent like you ......that's like me going to your home countries and assuming all the Black people there are Americans from Chicago lol. Without us Black American descendants of U.S. slaves being here in this country for centuries fighting a freedom struggle, you wouldn't even have the legal right to be here, as was our freedom struggle that set the stage for America to change its immigration policies and allow for you all to come here.. This is why the overwhelming majority of you only started coming here in the 1960s, with half of you coming here after 1990""


To Black Africans say

""Oh, I'm a Black American descendant of U.S. slaves. My family has been in America since the 1700s.... my people have been holding the American nationality longer than you all have been repping nationalities that originate from Colonialism. My people have been in America since before the concept of any modern day African country even existed. I know you're an immigrant in America But you can't assume that every black person is an immigrant in the United States of America... Hell, if it weren't for black Americans fighting our own freedom struggle here in the United States of America you wouldn't even have the legal right to come here. People like you should feel a sinse of gratitude & respect  for how long black American US slave descended people have been fighting our freedom struggle here in our home country of the United States of America.....because it has provided so much access and opportunity to you that you wouldn't have without us and our history of being here for centuries."""

"I suggest that at the individual level, we do not yet know the reason why the question is asked.

Humans learn from observation and if generationaly there were advantages to know where someone hails from, the way we speak and greet each other is simply observed and passed on through generations.

With the huge, rapid advancements made in our societies on physical traveling as well as broadcasting information, it seems to be many of us are simply repeating the way our elders spoke and greeted each other. 

You highlighted beautifully how this practice didn't age well and will most likely disappear in a few generations.

A suggested replacement would be 
""what do you believe in / what are your passions"" which are more direct and rich conversation lines while straying away from assumptions made by the area we were raised in. As if we couldn't disagree with some aspects of ""our culture""

As an Ghanaian, it really pisses me off when I see other Africans attacking AAs for not knowing their roots. AAs get demonized for identifying as American, they get demonized for identifying with African tribes. I’ve seen other Africans criticizing black Americans for wearing traditional African clothing and call it cultural appropriations, but those same Africans will praise white people wearing our clothes. Meanwhile they have no problem taking from black American culture and reaping the benefits that black Americans fought for. Some of the most antiblack people I’ve ever met have been other black African or Caribbean ppl.

As someone of Ghanaian descent, I don’t understand the pressure some Africans put on black Americans to identify as African in the first place. I’ve been to some slave castles, stood in the dungeons where they used to have 200 people in a room the size of your average kitchen. At Cape Coast Castle in Ghana there’s this giant archway they call the “door of no return” for obvious reasons. And many of these people were stolen and sold by their own people, their fellow Africans.

"Thank you for this comment ❤️. And I hate when folks try to gaslight when I point out how rude it is to ask odd questions like the one OP got or pretend that black Americas have no culture/don’t know where they’re REALLY from. At this point, we’re as much American as someone who’s Jamaican can proudly claim Jamaican, and someone in an African country can claim their country. Just saying “uhh I’m from Michigan” is enough of an answer if they already know the person is AA lol. 

I think AAs have the problem of being attacked in this way often because of how hyper visible we are — we’re in the US (a very visible ass place), we have a culture that also shaped pop culture in the US which then went and spread everywhere via the military and entertainment, and we’ve been here so long it’s hard to look at any part of US history and not see *any* involvement, directly or indirectly, that black Americans had nothing to do with or weren’t affected by lmao. This is why I see no shame in AAs exclaiming “I’m American!” because it’s true… our ancestors lived, ate on, fought for, and have been buried here for generations! No reason to demonize AAs who identify more as American because it’s true lol

It’s another reason why I dislike the diminishing of teaching our history in schools, since it gives more opportunity for people to pretend we have no history besides slavery and no prideful things to claim like everyone else does! And we can’t claim their things, but ours is fair game because it’s “not real culture” backed by actual history. 

And if I had a dime every time this sort of discourse happened (especially online) but the non AA used AAVE and black American sayings, I could pay rent lol.

"Everything you said is 100% true!

> and someone in an African country can claim their country

That’s another part of this that makes no sense!!!! The countries that make up Africa today aren’t even the same ones that your ancestors left!!!! For example, I’n Ghanaian — the name Ghana was actually taken from a completely unrelated West African Kingdom from the Middle Ages. Technically, “Ghana” (as well as parts of Ivory Coast and Togo) should actually be Asanteland. Benin was actually called Dahomey, Nigeria was actually Benin, etc. Some countries even still use their colonizer names to this day like Cote d’Ivoire (which used to be Gyamaan, Bono, and other states), Angola, Kenya, etc. Not to mention that a majority of Africans are Christian or Muslim — neither of these religions are indigenous to the continent  and both were brought to us via colonization. (Coptic Christianity is indigenous to Africa but most Africans practice European or American derived branches of Christianity.) It is so ridiculous to criticize AA for that as if any of us can ever truly understand our identities before colonialism and slavery. 

And it is so ridiculous that people will claim a black American “doesn’t know their history” for calling themself American but won’t say the same for a Jamaican. 

Lol people will be talking about AAs having no culture as they participate in things that were made so popular by AAs that they are now universally ubiquitous.

Well idk. I think it depends what generation you are and how long you’ve lived outside of your parents country. For example, I’m Kenyan Canadian but I and my sisters and cousins never lived in Kenya, we were all born and raised in Canada. I never really consider my tribe when I’m not in Kenya. And if asked I’d say I’m Black or Kenyan-Canadian or even African-Canadian, and I know my family around my age and younger would and a lot of other 2nd generation Africans would. And also because I was raised here I don’t really separate being Kenyan from being Canadian. I would never just tell someone I’m Kenyan bc I’ve never lived a phase of my life where I was Kenyan without being Canadian. Do you know what I mean? But I have many friends who moved to Canada when they were very young or even into adolescence and they would consider themselves the country where they were born first and Canadian second. Which makes sense, there was literally a time in their life where they were solely South African, or Zimbabwean or Ghanian without being Canadian since they hadn’t moved yet. But a lot of 2nd gen African-Canadians like myself consider themselves Black Canadian because of how we’re socialized here.

"I think they might be responding like that because your response came off a little….”’splainy” while possibly not getting my point.

Yes, each individual black Caribbean is from their respective country, but black people are not indigenous to the Caribbean. So a Caribbean getting up their own ass that a black American or Canadian doesn’t “know where they’re from” is positively flaunting their ignorance. 

There is also tendency for black Caribbean and African culture and existence to be considered more “valid” and “cultured” than black American or Canadian, which is actually something Africans have no right to do either, but is exceptionally ridiculous coming from Caribbeans."

No I completely agree! I may have been unclear — I was also referring to the names of the countries and not the actual ethnicities. I had a roommate who was from Ivory Coast for example and because she was ethnically Akan (although Bono instead of Asante) we actually spoke a similar dialect of Twi and could understand each other! Meanwhile, I have family friends who are Ghanaian but not Akan and speak languages like Ga and it’s a completely different language. *But* some people in Togo are ethnically close to Ga and likely able to understand. All the borders are made up.	International_Key949	reply	na	na	na	0.9993215799331665	weak	strong	no	na	blackladies

"No, I’m not confused. It’s not a hard concept to grasp lol. If you are born in a particular country, then that’s your nationality. Usually when you immigrate to a western country, your parents’ origin is your ethnicity. That’s it. I’m very well aware of how Black immigrants identify in NA, US and Europe. 

However, you said that Brits don’t consider you British which is what I was referring. Did you read your own comment or…? Also as for being Black in Canada, there are Black Nova Scotians, an actual Black Canadian ethnic group very similar to African Americans in that they’ve been there for centuries so much longer than your 1-3 generations. Although, another commenter pointed that out, but it’s basic history.

Either way, I’m talking specifically about African Americans and how we identify ourselves, as what the OP was about."	International_Key949	reply	na	na	na	0.9993215799331665	no	no	no	na	blackladies

"I’m describing how your response may have come off. While I did understand your point, it took me a minute and reading your other comment to get it, and I can easily see how the other person did *not* understand. You need to realize that in this context, a ‘splainy comment primary full of the elementary information you included, wiki links, and lectures about your Igbo heritage *could come off* as if you are talking down to AA and black Canadians as if we are too ignorant to understand how we got here. It’s a little too inclusive of information that anyone making my comment would absolutely need to know to make the comment in the first place, which again, is ‘splainy and kind of makes it unclear whether you understood my comment until a reread.

"Hey Ladies 💕,

So i got out of a relationship a lil while ago and what i can say for sure is sex is very very important for me especially when we are both compatible. 
I am into BDSM, i have always been kinda into it. I have never really done that before but i really hope my next partner is into it. 

I guess, my question to you who already experienced it is: when you did was it up to your expectations? Did you like it?
Cause it can get kinda scary. 

I think the main reason why i am so much into it is the idea of surrendering myself to someone and trusting him enough to let him do anything with my body?? And i feel pleasure while in pain or stressful situations during sex too? I feel it's a beautiful thing and i understand it might not be for everyone but how bad does it get???

Excuse my bad English is i am a native French speaker. Thank you💕"	rReey_El	post	26.303392615635474	female	White	0.0012648013653233647	na	na	na	41	blackladies
"Hello!

Long time kinkster. I use to teach classes on breath play and BDSM basics back in the day and went to BlackBeat when it was around. Also taught human sexuality on a collegiate level and hopefully will have a chance to do it again when chasing tenure. 

Also been married for 9 years and collared for 10.

We're not active in the scene at the moment, because we're busy with careers and two kids but stage two of the remodel will include hard points anchored all around the house. It never really stops per se ;-) 

BDSM is great and I would say from my long history of experience having a community was very important for me when I was younger. It gave me a chance to learn, explore, teach and develop mentorships. Because of that I learned to recognize and navigate away from signs of abuse and had lots of peers to explore and play with.

Emotional abuse is something that is all too rampant and making sure you can separate out that behavior is so important.  It can be hard to do when encountering really good manipulators. 

I highly recommend that if you are just starting out is to find a group to explore within. I solo played a lot from fetlife when I was younger and feel like those situations were much more problematic than when I explored within a group. 

To answer your question about expectations. I had a FANTASTIC time exploring the scene. Play parties were a ton of fun and gave me a safe place to explore everything from breath play to fire play and mummification. You name it I tried it in a SAFE group setting. I did a scene auction for charity once and whew.... still one of my best memories. You can go down the rabbit hole really fast.

Relationships wise is a different story all together. Let me just say that rich dudes with fetishes were the worst. But then again maybe I was the worst too but I encountered a lot of men in vanilla relationships who wanted side toys and men who definitely fetishsized Black women. That's why I was happy to be introduced to BlackBeat and blackcentric kink groups. If they are still around, which I'm sure thay are in some form or another. Find them. 

Scene and dating wise it was all fun. Marriage wise, eh that's another thing all together and I unfortunately do not know a ton of folks who've made it and are kinky. I'm moving along nicely but kink has definitely taken a back seat and 24/7 has evolved a lot for us. 

Have fun! Find some peers and never settle!"	rReey_El	reply	na	na	na	0.0012648013653233647	weak	strong	no	na	blackladies
"Eh.  I thought I was into it, maybe I am into it and because of other issues have lost interest?  Maybe I'm not with the right people for it?  I don't know.

It doesn't have to be sexual, though you'd think being half naked and getting stimulated would involve sex.

It's a big conversation to have, ideas and fantasies don't necessarily translate well into practice."	rReey_El	reply	na	na	na	0.0012648013653233647	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
"I’d say read into some online communities about it. Understand safe words and consent fully, and know how to vet a person well. When doing certain acts, accidental death can occur if the people involved aren’t careful. Remember, this isn’t just about pleasure here. Your life, health, and well-being are at stake as well.

Have fun, but be careful so u don’t end up traumatized."	rReey_El	reply	na	na	na	0.0012648013653233647	weak	no	no	na	blackladies
"I can say that it's only scary if you don't fully trust your partner and/or if you're unsure if you truly want to go through with an action. You NEED trust and security in the fact that you WANT the action(s) to happen because if you don't you could end up with some trauma. 

It just matters if you like it. 

Some things I thought I liked in my head I have tried IRL and literally hated it. Some things I thought I hated in my head I've tried IRL (out of pure curiosity) and have LOVED it. Again just having a partner, a safeword, and a place to talk about it afterward is so much more important than the act in itself. 

I'm guessing you're leaning on being a sub and if done right it can feel immensely euphoric, kind of like a dream/floaty state. But that is if you trust the person and feel comfortable to be vulnerable with them. It's quite rewarding for all involved. 

Not everything is for anyone and that's perfectly okay. 

""How bad does it get"" is kind of like setting some alarms off in my head right now because like it's not supposed to be ""bad"". Even though the action of letting someone control you is seen as ""bad"" it should feel good if you are into it. 

Before I was in a relationship I looked into BDSM made a literal list of the things I thought I liked and started from there. The next step is telling your partner if they agree to do these things with you. And if they don't then you need to make a decision on if it's something that is a NEED in a relationship.

As a SA victim, I find it very comforting how strict the kink community is about consent. I also like how sex doesn’t have to be the end goal.

"Hiya, I am a kinkster, counselor whose fav niche is kinksters, and you are far from alone. I think one of the things that has helped me over time is recognizing that you do have to find people who are willing to \*build\* trust or whose attitudes focus everyone having a good time, negotiations, and boundaries. I have been involved in kink since I first became sexual and in kink communities for roughly 5+ years. One of the best things new people can do is give themselves permission to learn as much as possible, and truly I believe I learned the most from other women especially switches. The most important thing is to learn what \*you\* want, and even if that's just to be used like an object you still have to process what that means. You also have to learn to ask for it and not have a top or dominant just know. One of the most common mistakes I and others seem to make is not speaking up. I don't just mean using the negotiated safe words, but concrete communication around sexual and emotional needs. Far too often we get into relationships then get hurt someone isn't doing what we want when we thought we were clear. Being non-monogamous, I have 4 dominant leaning parters and not a single one tops me like the other. Every single individual is unique, and as a kinkster I now know I have to speak very specifically when I want something. If I want orders sometimes I have to be willing to ask one, or accept another just is not dominant through orders but expresses it in others way. Look for someone(s) that hears you and seek clarity.

"The first experience I had just kind of happened. It was something we both mutually wanted but hadn't talked about, but happened very organically.  I think that's a big part of what made me realize I liked it. 

I felt it was more important to discuss it with partners going forward, because most people who haven't been involved in that kind of sexual relationship have a vague understanding of concent once you're already in the act. But I've learned it doesn't hurt to ask -even in the moment- and it's always best when you find someone who's kinky in the same way."	rReey_El	reply	na	na	na	0.0012648013653233647	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
"I enjoyed it for many years. I did it alone for about 10. Then with community for another 10. That community was Black. We had conferences, shared meals, went to dungeons. Some of us were particularly cool with one another and would attend house parties. I was blessed to visit the homes of some of the OGs (Mistress Mir, Max rules) and sit in with younger incredible artists like Darque DeSade, Black Kat... I got to learn a lot, engage in documenting the history, and really appreciate it elders who sacrificed much. It was a beautiful thing - it was fam.

I've never used a safe word bc it shortchanges communication and isn't foolproof. I don't know what the community looks like these days, but if you can find one, do.

"Whats up sisters, 

I feel like I just need to vent about how insane the dating market is right now. I am a 25F who recently got back on Hinge after months of being off of it. I matched w/ this guy 2 weeks ago (25M — he’s white if that matters) and we seemed to hit it off super well. We would talk every single day throughout the day, conversations were never dry — we would talk about real stuff not just small talk, and we even FaceTimed as well. He would constantly compliment me on my looks and personality and tell me how refreshing it was to match with someone like me as he’s had poor luck w online dating. After about 3-4 days he asked me out on a date which was *supposed* to take place yesterday. I was beyond excited to meet him bc I felt a good vibe with him, he’s super sweet, and I found him really attractive and funny. The only “red flag” I guess was that he got married super young (18) and is divorced (has been for over 2 years) and has a 4 year old daughter. This is something that probably would have bothered me when I was younger but I’m okay w/ dating divorcée’s in reason of course. He never made an effort to hide this part of his life or be deceitful which I appreciated. 

Anyway, this previous Sunday, he didn’t text me back all day long until 9 PM which was super uncharacteristic of him bc he always replies relatively quickly and holds good conversation. I didn’t think too much of it though until he did the same thing Tuesday. Didn’t text me back for 24+ hours. Wednesday comes around and still haven’t heard from him. Keep in mind our date is supposed to be Thursday around lunch time so I text him to confirm that the date is still on. He texts me back saying that he his ex wife dropped off his daughter on Tuesday for him to watch her for the next 3 days while she works (she’s a nurse). He gets his daughter every weekend so if his story checks out, he literally had his daughter Saturday-Monday only to get her again Tuesday? Okay. Although I would have appreciated more communication on his end, totally fine — things happen. What fucked me up is that he apologized profusely for having to cancel last minute but made 0 efforts to reschedule the date and hadn’t texted me since Wednesday. And I’m just like wtf? 

I get we don’t owe each other any commitment and we are just getting to know each other but WHY would you talk to someone for 2 weeks, tell them how beautiful they are and how you can’t wait to meet up with them, only to cancel on them the day before and ghost them entirely? And it also leads me to question, what if I didn’t reach out to confirm the date? Would he have just stood me up? I’m a bit of a hopeless romantic as I’ve never been in a real relationship before so I admittedly can fall for people relatively quickly which is something I need to work on. But i can’t help but to question if there’s something i did or said that would make him ghost me like this. Similar situation happened about a month ago w/ me being randomly ghosted after the first date. It sucks bc i desire love so deeply but keep getting wrapped up in situations like this :/ 

TLDR: i keep getting ghosted and I’m sad about it."	realrawpromise	post	32.50008556482946	male	White	0.9885590672492981	na	na	na	34	blackladies
Sorry this happened to you. Ghosting is just part of modern dating, unfortunately. Don't take it personally. It says more about the ghoster's communication skills and consideration for others than you. Also, when you're in your 20s, have never been in a relationship, and don't have kids, there's no reason for you to date someone who was married and has a child. If you're dating in your 30s, you can do that. But enjoy dating other carefree people while there's a lot of them in your pool, you can be more spontaneous and it's so much more fun!	realrawpromise	reply	na	na	na	0.9885590672492981	strong	no	no	na	blackladies
"This is the nature of online dating. When I was single I made sure not to get too attached until the man showed me that he wanted a relationship. This means: me asking him upfront early on what he wanted. “I just wanna see where it goes” is code for a hookup situation. I opted out of those. When we’ve been on a couple dates and I’ve seen that in most of not all interactions I’m getting treated like someone who is truly being vetted to be a GF, then I get more attached, feel more comfortable setting expectations, etc. 

It will feel like you’re looking for a needle in a haystack. That’s because you are. I was super intentional about looking for a BF. I once cut a meeting for drinks because the man was so full of shit. Had I wasted time on him I would’ve missed meeting the love of my life. We met on Tinder.

Best of luck. Someone is out there waiting for you to find them."	realrawpromise	reply	na	na	na	0.9885590672492981	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
"Sending hugs 🫂 

> why would you talk to someone for 2 weeks, tell them how beautiful you are and how you can’t wait to meet up with them

Because they’re abnormal! Normal people do not gush over internet strangers. They realise they are still strangers and have tempered excitement about a prospective date. 

It’s super easy to get swept away in the romance and the excitement but remember those people are *more* likely to ghost and cancel, than somebody who texts once or twice a day. I do not want to say he was lovebombing you because I think people stretch the meaning of words, but remember that someone who doesn’t know you cannot hold authentic feelings for you. 

I think your desire for love is blinding you to this reality. Take it slow, relax and don’t fall for the words of somebody you *do not know*."	realrawpromise	reply	na	na	na	0.9885590672492981	weak	no	no	na	blackladies
"That is awful.  You didn’t do anything wrong.  Sometimes people suck.  You didn’t do anything to make him change his mind.  

Here are some efficiency methods that helped me and some pals.

Consider speed dating. Always contact the organizer before registration to make sure you’re the ideal customer for any event. If not, ask which events would be optimal for you.

Meet within one week (coffee or happy hour) of first contact.
 
Do not exchange phone numbers, Whatsapp, Snapachat etc until after you first meet.

Call your first meeting a meet and not a date.
 
Use a burner number 
 
If you discover a catfish turn on your heels and leave.

First meet should be about an hour.  (If you traveled  a bit  and don’t want to come all the way home then simply schedule stuff with pals 80-90 minutes after the scheduled start of your date. It helps anyway to have a pal or few collect you so he sees that you’re loved.
 
If they are rude leave ASAP. You don’t have to be polite once that happens.

Always carry money in whatever form. Cash is easiest because you can throw it and run. This is also why coffee and happy hour are freat meets and early dates. They are low cost.

AGAIN you did nothing wrong.  
 
Ghosting doesn’t feel good. For me it forced me to get over what ever feelings or excitement that we’re building up."	realrawpromise	reply	na	na	na	0.9885590672492981	weak	strong	no	na	blackladies
It’s a learning curve but basically pay much more attention to actions than words. A man looking for something serious would never leave room for doubt. When they are serious they will put in the effort to lock you down so to speak. So they will communicate, initiate, plan, commit and more.

He just wanted to get some attention from a woman for a little while and probably never had any intention of meeting. Men on online dating apps do that a lot, I've learned. I won't talk to a dude for longer than a couple of days before meeting in person. And those convos are just establishing that the vibe is good and what the logistics of the meeting are. If we Facetime or video call it's only briefly to confirm we're not catfishing and then we meet in person.	realrawpromise	reply	na	na	na	0.9885590672492981	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
We don't know why men do the things that they do but maybe he felt there was no need for a date since you and him said everything you had to say on the phone. Be mysterious! Why did you need to talk and text everyday for two weeks? If he wants to know more, you tell him he'll find out in person. That weeds out the men that are only interested in having a texting buddy and have no intentions  of going out. Also, date multiple men. You are on a dating site.

These “men” ain’t shit on the apps. It’s a place for them to play with unsuspecting strangers with no life connection to them. They are all (and this should be your mindset) just one text away from ghosting. Most of what they’ve said to you is 100% fabricated. You will not ever meet 9 out of 10 of them regardless of how much you’ve texted/talked. In fact, the more you have non face to face interactions, the less likely you will be to meet them.

Cut and run. Move on. Back in my app days, I wouldn’t talk on the phone or text unless we were setting up the initial meet up. You want to get to know me? Let’s start by establishing physical chemistry by meeting up for 30 minutes. I can waste 30 minutes if I need to.

"Are those other people’s voices in your head? Tell them to get out lol. Well-meaning adults (for the most part) in my life constantly try to get me to reevaluate and lower one standard or another that I have. Many of these adults are just working off of their experiences mind you, and are not even in relationships anyone should aspire to be in. 

I’ve been told to date men with kids, date white men, date outside of my preferences and let looks “grow” on me, and forget about integrity because men don’t have it… 

I let none of it dictate my actual dating. I might try something out, but ultimately my standards and dealbreakers are just that… mine. I currently don’t date men who have been married and/or have kids for many reasons, but the main one is I want to experience marriage and kids for the first time with a man who it’s also his first time. It’s a non-negotiable and I will not go out with any man who fits those categories because there is no point. I’m 26, I can have this dealbreaker. If I’m single at 36, I will most likely shift this dealbreaker to better reflect the pool of men.

"This was 4ish years ago so I don’t remember but I can tell you I moved to a major city and was in a relationship with in 6 months. That said, I don’t remember going on dates every week. It wasn’t possible because I have had a very full life. 

That said I was *very* upfront about wanting a relationship. Either I asked while getting to know them over the app, text, or in person. I always told them “hey, I’m not looking to waste your time or mine, so what’s up?” I wasn’t interested in being friends for a year to figure out if we want to make it official. A lot of women are averse to doing that but I’m telling you it helped sort people out very quickly. 

Second, I never gave a man much of a list about what I was looking for outside of things that has to do with character: patience, having strong principles, etc. Instead, I would tell him the treatment I’m used to getting from my close circle of friends & family. (In my opinion, the right person would fit right in effortlessly anyway.) I would tell them about how my people cared for me by showing up when I needed them the most & listened when I need them (aka I have people; no they’re not going anywhere; if you’re bad news they will tell me; and they will pull up if necessary). I would say how my people are generous and so am I. I had a friend take me on a whole vacation. (Aka if you’re not generous and/ or are stingy, you can go now). The list goes on. I don’t know if I’m making a lick of sense but I’m *telling you* it made people sort themselves out of my life without me doing much.

"Hi ladies. I got a new job working at a airport lounge. I’ve gone through two days of orientation where we all sat in a classroom and got to know each other and learned the company’s values. I hate this, but for some reason I feel like I naturally fall into the role of protecting other girls and trying to help them out. Now of course, as we all work together, if someone needs help then I’ll help them, and I definitely look out for other women if they’re being mistreated or harassed, but how do I not fall into the stereotypical “protecting other women and sticking up with them and helping them” when I really don’t need to?

I’m not sure if this post makes sense, and I’m sure there’s a term for it but I feel like I subconsciously start prioritizing other peoples issues and going out of my way to help people even though nobody else me in return. Now nobody asks me to do this, my co workers are chill and it seems like everyone will pull their own weight, so I’m not sure why I feel like need to make myself the savior for everyone else.

"It's hard because if alcohol becomes a problem, you can just quit drinking. but you can't quit eating when food is the problem. here are some tips I can share:

1. Keep a food journal - notice which foods trigger binging. I find usually it's processed foods, foods containing a lot of cheese, foods containing a lot of carbs/bleached flour or sugar or starch like rice or potatoes.
2. Diet soda can also encourage overeating. I wouldn't go there.
3. Treat it like any other addiction. While you can't stop eating, you can 100% stop eating foods that trigger binging.  They must be eliminated completely.
4. A craving does not have to be acknowledged or granted. Eat 3 meals per day and a snack, keep your body full and satisfied. Tell your body when it wants a craving that it will be fed and satisfied and happy but we're not going to eat cake today and that's ok.
5. find natural, unprocessed sources to indulge. Fruit smoothies, chocolate smoothies, protein powder cakes, etc. - healthy options that DONT trigger binges.

some people will tell you - oh just eat 1 cookie per day. Addictions and binges are a different beast than people who can just eat one cookie and put the bag away.

I definitely recommend looking into binge eating disorder and look into intuitive eating. 

Every time you restrict yourself when dieting your brain is eventually going to override that. It’s how we are wired. Body senses food is scarce, so it sends hormones to your brain that make you want to seek out the most calorie rich foods (carbs and sweets) possible to stock up and not starve."	sushi_fufu	reply	na	na	na	0.9967383742332458	no	no	no	na	blackladies

-I can’t even spell the title right sorry lol but I’m sure you know what I meant 

Tldr- im black and get mistaken for any race but my own and it makes me feel weird 

I’m a teen on the internet a lot cause I don’t  go outside and I play games with voice chat a lot or voice call with people and whatever and it’s sooooo annoying when it comes to the “what do you look like” part and they guess Asian first. Then maybe like white or Hispanic. Then they’re like, what are you then? Black bruh 

Like I met this person while playing games with a friend and he’s a nice person but while we were playing I told him he sounded like a generic e-dude who played Valorant (the game) and he said I sounded like the typical Asian e girl and then he said “oh wait are you even Asian”💀💀💀 

My voice is kinda high and I talk quieter cause my mom is nosy 

Then later when it was just us two playing he asked what I was and guessed Korean and I said I was black and it’s just so annoying. Like okay it’s fine to guess that if people who general sound the way I do usually have the same ethnicity, but for my actual race to not even be a guess because “oh wow it’s impossible for you to be black cause you sound so not black”

Lastly->>>   When me and the guy were playing with two other strangers, they were making like black jokes or something or saying I called someone like something black idk what they were saying, in private chat my friend asked if they knew I was black or not. I replied with “no? ‘Hi I just met you but I thought you should know I was black just in case’ “ so can see how weird that would be.

It’s not my fault you assumed and it’s not my job to immediately “warn” you of my race 💀💀 nobody ever gets the “did you tell them you were white or Asian?” and it sucks. Maybe if I say the n word surely it’ll make it more obvious. 

It’s just that when people “sound their race” and it’s time to face reveal or whatever, it’s never a race surprise. Maybe a “wow you’re actually kinda ugly/ hot” or “wow I didn’t expect you to have long wavy hair” but I know if I do it it’ll be like “you’re black?” and it’s just so weird.

I rarely imagine what people look like but if I do and it turns out I’m completely wrong, I don’t make it awkward because I know what it feels like and plus they’re my friend regardless so why bother making it weird. The same dude said that to the girl I was playing with when I met him but I think it’s because her deeper voice makes us think of her as a brunette and not a blond. Either way I wouldn’t mention it cause it’s not important enough to matter unless she looked like a guy or 30yos 

Anyway->

It’s been a while since that happened to me and I forgot how much it sucked. And low key, since I sound like a kawaii Asian girl uwu it feels like I need to look as pretty as I can to make up for the blacknesss😀

💀 Same thing happened to me in the past when I gamed. I hate talking in games, and I usually try to avoid it. When I do speak, most people assume I am either white or Asian. It wasn’t until I tell someone my race that I get a 50/50 reaction. Either surprise (which is weird bc why are acting shocked I usually cease communication after that weird reaction) or some folks are like “Oh okay.” and we move on. Nowadays, I don’t disclose anything about myself, some people make guesses and roll with their assumption. I play one game where I don’t need to talk and most folks assume that I’m guy playing a female character and I’m okay with that. Being a female gamer is…it’s something else, so if you wanna think I’m a guy, okay!	Acrisomnuss	reply	na	na	na	0.9992676377296448	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

Yeah the reaction always sucks. Even the “oh okays ” sound like some sort of disappointment (or maybe they’re embarrassed idk) lol. I love to talk to people and be goofy though so I’m okay with using my mic. Usually I’m not trying to be any body’s bestie so I just ignore any weird comments for the rest of the game.

"Ranting because I'm OVER IT.

I've had knotless braids for about 11 weeks, been out of town with a hectic schedule and my usual braider is booked out through August.

Went on style seat and found someone with several (mainly) positive reviews, looked through her IG, etc. Booked the appointment and sent her a message asking if I could book a blow out as well. She said yes but it would have to be a silk press. Fine, whatever. Booked the silk press ($125) in addition to the take down ($175). Then she messaged me asking if I wanted an Olaplex treatment and trim (extra $70+). I said no thank you, I just had a trim before I had my braids put in.

She continued to try and sell me on it as being healthy for my hair, and I just said thanks again, but I'm only interested in the take down and silk press.

Then she said, ""As a healthy hair stylist, that doesn't work for me. I'm cancelling both of your appointments"". I asked her if she would just do the braid take down and she said no. I mean, it's her business her rules, but why have all of these options separately on style seat if you're only going to book people who do all three?

Anyway...spent forever searching for more stylists. A lot of braiders don't offer takedown services for knotless braids, or they do but they won't offer a wash/blow dry as a separate service. Crazy.

I scheduled with two more stylists as a contingency, woke up this morning and one of them cancelled on me saying she was no longer available, even though she was the one who confirmed the appointment earlier.

So I guess I'll be going with the third option. Won't be getting a wash/blow dry, but at least I'll be getting my hair taken down.

Is black hair care this hard for everyone everywhere? The attitudes are just insane. End rant

&#x200B;

UPDATE EDIT: The second stylist who cancelled on me messaged me to cancel the appointment. I'm not sure if this was to avoid a fee on her end or what. But I told her that since she cancelled the appointment after already confirming me, she needed to cancel it from her end. She refused and told me to cancel or else I would be charged on the day of my appointment. So I emailed style seat with screenshots, they looped her into the email, and told her that SHE needs to cancel the appointment. Point of the story, always keep records when dealing with these people,HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE, and don't let them try and get one over on you.

When you’re working in a salon that’s most likely owned by a veteran there’s some type of professionalism and education expected and if your playing games you’re fired. But nowadays everyone wants to be an entrepreneur but skipping the education, so now you have ppl running off of advice from “get the bag” influencers, which results in all these weird shenanigans (imo).

"Girl, that’s shit. I’m so sorry. I’ve had issues with stylists on Style Seat lately. There are so many bad ones out there. 

But the truth is, it’s always been like this. The professional black hair community has always cut corners, has always treated customers like gum on its shoe, has always been largely unprofessional. I have had more bad hair experiences in my life than good ones. I can count the number of good, professional hairdressers I’ve had in my entire life on one hand. And I’ve done it all - braids, relaxers, weaves, wigs, natural. If you’re not late, you’re rude. If you’re not rude, you are an amateur. If you’re not an amateur, you say derogatory things about my 4c hair or about the hair I use. If you keep your mouth shut, you braid or weave too tightly. If you are a unicorn, you cost an arm and a leg and are impossible to get into. It’s always SOMETHING with these hair dressers. I’m almost 40 years old and have been in and out of chairs since I was 7. It’s always been a racket. 

I’ve been watching a ton of YouTube lately and I truly commend these young girls for learning how to grow their own hair and do their own hair.   I’m finally at a point where I want to learn for myself. I plan to find a braider, a weave installer, and a natural hair stylist for trims and rotate through but in between, I’m doing it myself because I’m just done with them."

"Stylists from styleseat are scammers. I would recommend looking up actual salons in your area. I went to a braider from styleseat who lied and said she could do a style she had never done before just because she wanted the money. She wouldn't allow me to look in the mirror when she was braiding either. When I finally saw the style it was a hotmess, I told her it looked nothing like I'd asked and she proceeded to gaslight me and tell me it did. She refused to fix it and made me pay. I walked out looking like a whole-ass clown. I had to go to an African braider the next day to redo it, they were shocked when they saw my hair. Their professionalism was on another level. I left the styleseat braider a bad review and she blasted me on Instagram for being a ""fake reviewer"" even though I was a verified customer. I spoke to some friends and they had similar experiences with styleseat. Anyone can signup on there, and a lot of those 5-star reviews end up being from friends and family who booked them to increase their rating.

If you benefit from the exposure and booking of style seat then you need to pay them their fee (quick Google search says 3% per transaction, that doesn't seem like much). Especially if you're already charging exorbitant amounts for the services and expecting people to come wash/blow dried etc.

Trimming for split ends used to be included, now the lady that I go to charges $17.  I've been attempting to try to learn to do things myself since I am not in the office but it's rough. 

I just got one of those revAir dryers so that I can hopefully avoid the hair stylist until I need a trim (first use didn't go that well but I know there's a learning curve).  These new stylists nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING. It's really frustrating.

I get that she's young and trying to figure things out but that's not how you treat loyal customers (I went to her every week). 

I absolutely cannot deal with flakes....my sister moved to TX and since she's been down there she and my BIL had a child. My sister tries to take her places down there and it's even worse than here!  Your best bet, if you can find one, is to get an old school stylist.  I know that many have retired, but you may be able to find one somewhere.  I used to go JCPenney when I was in between stylists....it's very expensive there too but you may find for everything you want you can get it there until you figure something out.  I can't even imagine paying $125 for a silk press every week....the lady I am seeing now, she can blow my hair straight without the press, I've been doing that for about a year and a half and it's $40.

After the Style Seat disaster, I got a good referral from a coworker who went to a hispanic guy doing hair in a JC Penny. He was pretty good for a while. 

Then I got referred to an uncle's relative doing hair on the side and at a questionable salon, thought I'd try her and ""be close to family.""

Wow it’s a mess out here. Braiders with no cosmology license are charging outrageous prices. Many don’t wash because legally they can’t do any chemical related service so you have to take down, wash, detangle your own hair for them to charge you $175. The ones that are licensed see these posts with people getting $350 for a silk press and have raised their prices thinking they can charge like a person who does entertainers and very weathly clients hair. Sisterlocks is the worst! $1500 to install 3 inches of hair and $100 more for each inch. So people are cutting their hair off to save money. Must retighten 6-8 weeks are you are charged double. You are tied to that Loctician forever unless you want to retighten 400 locs yourself. Then they leave you because they really only want to install for the big bucks but not maintain.

My current stylists includes a wash in all her services because she said a lot of people don’t know how to wash their hair and as a licensed professional she is taught to wash for sanitary purposes. But there are some styles she just isn’t great at, like lace closures, or ponytails. Even braids. I go the Africans for my braids. It did take some trial and error to find a shop that was gentle and focused on hair growth, but I only go to then for my braids. I found out about them from my cousin.

"I didn’t get my hair done for YEARS - my cousin had us try someone new for braids/locs. She is punctual, professional, doesn’t talk on her phone and there are no additional people in her work space.

Which we all know is very uncommon.

When my old stylist starting using Style Seat, it was the end of the road for me. Even though I was her client from way back when she rented a chair, she refused to acknowledge any issues I was having with booking an appointment or rescheduling."

I do my best to avoid going to black owned hair salons or black stylists.  My mom is going to show me how to corn row so I can do my own crochet dreads (she does them for me right now).  But I’m over the unprofessionalism.  Last minute cancellations, over priced for the quality, rude, and they have horrible planning.  Like if my appoint is at 3, I shouldn’t still be sitting there at 5 waiting on you.  I do my own take downs and washes because it’s just not worth it to go to stylist to do it.  I get my hair trimmed once every 6 months but other than that, I don’t get my hair done anymore at salons.	AngmarsFinest	reply	na	na	na	0.9994213581085205	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

Damn. That is soo annoying. I hadn't gotten my hair done by a stylist in years until about a month ago. Although the service was fast, the work itself wasn't top notch and this is a well-known hair braiding place with good reviews. I went because I wanted it done in a few hours versus me doing on over the course of a weekend. Honestly, my work is better. I guess it's because it's my own hair and I care about each strand but I feel like stylists should want to do great work or at least above average. Like how am I going to be pointing out to you several ends with hair that already looks raggedy? And it's not even a full day with the style yet...I'm going back to doing my own hair after this.

So she cancels the appointment THEN messages me 4 days after the cancelation to respond to my original message 🤷🏾‍♀️ and this braider was on style seat too

I haven't been to the salon since before COVID. When I did, I lucked out and found a black stylist at of all places Ulta. Sadly, she has retired. I am looking to get my hair cut into a style, so I have to start my search all over again. If it wasn't for wanting it cut I would do what I normally do and just do my own hair.

Omg that is horrible. Idk what’s it’s come to. But I remember this type of behavior brewing up around 10 years ago . I had a professional stylist who I would go to every 2 weeks to get a wash and blow out. I was transitioning from relaxed to natural but I still wanted to wear my hair straight. She acted as though my head of hair, was her head of hair. She would stop seeing you as a client if you canceled three times. And she was constantly pushing this expensive $900 keratin smoothing system down my mom and I throat. Despite my mom being a single parent who was trying her best to ensure her teenage daughter felt beautiful and cared. I had really bad social anxiety at the time and for some reason she didn’t really like my mom and had a difficult time not showing it. One time my mom was late picking me up after my appt and she wanted to go get some lunch. She wanted to lock her shop if she wasn’t there. The shop wasn’t in a bad area or anything like that. I was like 15 years old but she refused to leave me by myself due to “liability” like I wouldn’t just sit on my phone. She was so angry and it made me feel horribly guilty. It made the whole experience very uncomfortable and I dreaded seeing her. We live in a predominantly white town so I didn’t want to complain because I was grateful to be getting my hair done in the first place. The final straw came when one day my mom and I weren’t sure what time our appointment was for the next day. I had a Dr appt I needed to make but we wanted to make it work around my hair appt. The appt had been moved an hour up or down from the normal time and so we called to confirm. She refused to answer calls and texts, finally my mom drove up to her salon to ask and as soon as we walk in the door without look up she tells us the time. Like she knew what we wanted and had to go through all of that trouble. Stopped seeing her after that and it’s part of the reason I’m so hesitant to go to stylists now. Especially the way they been acting lately?? nooooo ma’am.	AngmarsFinest	reply	na	na	na	0.9994213581085205	weak	strong	no	na	blackladies

"It's hard enough existing as a WOC without hair being this much of a focus.

1. Most salons these days only cater to fully natural hair. I was relaxed and growing my natural hair out, but salons refused to service transitioning hair. I didn't want to big chop. Ok...
2. So I decided to start relaxing my hair again. Most professional salons don't include relaxing services anymore, and I'm not going to go to just anyone's basement. Found a place near me and sat in a chair for 8 HOURS, the three times I went there. ""We overbooked"" ""Something glitched in our system and we lost your appointment so now we're squeezing you in"". I just stopped going there. So....
3. I figured braids as a protective style while I grow my natural hair out will work. Now I can't get a take down and wash without booking 3 other services, or people just don't offer wash/blow dry services, OR they don't take down knotless braids.
4. Last option is just going to salons that aren't experienced with AA hair :/ 

Tired of dealing with bad attitudes, bad service, or just...services not being available. I work 60 hours a week and have a career, worrying about my hair is at the bottom of my priorities. That's why I enjoyed the braids so much...but if getting a take down is this much of a hassle, I don't even know anymore."

Too many times, I'd be on my way out the door and she's texting saying she's running behind.  Then that became moving my appt. I've always had 8 am appts she could only do 8:30 then that became 9 and then when she couldn't make that...ugh...she was screwing my whole day up!!  I've never gone to a salon where I had to wait all day, I don't have the patience. Once she started on me, I would be done in about an hour and a half but it was getting to be too much with the time changes/unprofessionalism.

All the braids were inconsistent in sizing and she didn’t braid them down so they started unraveling when I got home. When I told her I didn’t like the style she had the audacity to say I was irking her nerves and that she would post a pic of my hair on insta and “let her followers decide if it was a good style”.

"This is exactly what happened to me when it came to braiders - and like you said, it's the customer experience & their attitude that really gets under my skin. 

And you know who came to the rescue?  
TikTokers that reposted beginner-friendly tutorials on Pinterest & some YouTubers that introduced me to the ""rubberband technique"".

Because of them, people think I get my hair professionally done.  
I change up my hair every 1-2 weeks, because it takes me 30 minutes to 4 hours (depending on the style) for me to wash my hair & install the braids.  
And of course, I save coin and bypass the 'chair drama'.

"From a person that rocked a shaved head for almost 10 years, let me break down some of the perks:

**Night Maintenance:** Brush the hair with some product. Pop on a durag. Done.   
**Day Maintenance:** Take the durag off. Done.  
**Wash Day:** The routine is cut down to 5 minutes. Wash, condition, leave-in, brush, durag.  
**Trim:** Hit up a female-friendly barber shop every 2-4 weeks for a shape up and line up. You're in and out of the chair in 20 minutes (between $25-$40). But if you're not getting anything fancy, and taking it ALL OFF (zero cut against the grain?) - get a family member to do it for you for free. That's what I do.😏

If your hair gets wet, who cares! It still looks exactly the same.  
Couldn't do sports or workout REALLY HARD before because you were worried about your hair getting wet, sweaty, messy, dirty - blah, blah, blah!   
No more.   
Get snatched, get dirty, and wash your hair right after - pop on the durag for 5 minutes to do a ""style reset"" - and your done.  
Now that your hair is out the way, that leaves your face front & center - so have F-U-N with makeup, hunny!!!

"Reminders: There’s only so much healing you can do in an environment where you were abused/ weren’t meant flourish. It’s also ok to be affected by the abuse. They’ll always downplay the damage they’ve inflicted. Don’t gaslight yourself because they gaslight you!

I just finished meditating and this thought in the title came to me. I am stuck with my narc, emotionally abusive parents for a while. Im searching for a job continuously and of course I want to move. But it’s not happening right now until it’ll happen.  I would feel guilty because I feel like I can’t heal or i always feel residual trauma. But I’m with my abusive parents. It’s not the worst but it’s not the best . They’ve gaslighted me continuously and are very manipulative. I’m old enough to make my own decisions and I never get the respect for any decision that doesn’t align with exactly what they think should happen. I’m introverted and I hate big parties. My parents have forced me to go to parties continuously with my passive aggressive roasting family throughout my life. They don’t drag me by the arm but if I say no, they’ll bully me and say the worst things and talk about how my fam wants to see me. Mind you at these events, I say hi, hug have small talk and wait until we can leave. They’ll get mad if I go home early, they’ll get mad if I Uber home, they’ll get mad if I don’t smile the whole time. Then they won’t apologize or even acknowledge that they shouldn’t bully me and verbally abuse me to get what they want. That and many other situations would affect anyone right? Cause anyone is affected by anything! But, I was conditioned to not see anything they did as wrong ever, but they can nitpick me constantly. Hypocrisy much! 
All this to say, you are worthy of what you want. You can do what you want. Its not your job to manage people’s perception of you. If they want to infuse malice in everything you do, that’s what they want to do. Some people will always see you as the enemy for choosing yourself. Or for being a different person with different reactions. And to be honest…they’re probably so mad at us because we are choosing ourselves and when they had the chance, they decided to constantly self sacrifice in hopes of getting constant external validation and never got it. So they rather put that burden on us to self sacrifice and do for them instead of being like maybe I can learn to give a damn about myself."

"Hey y’all so the part that upsets me most is that this is true. I am an African American single mom of 2. I’m 28 years old. My first child I had when I was 23yo with my short term bf of 6 and a half months. The second father of my child is more recent I had a baby with my a man I was in a on and off situationship. Both baby daddies ain’t shit! The first one left and he has a bunch of other kids. The second baby daddy cheated on me when I was in the delivery room, he missed our daughter’s birth to get some coochie from some other woman. 

I work for a call center involving insurance. We have 8 people working in my work office (this whole building is divided in small rooms with groups of people with one supervisor that is in charge of us). The man that is in charge of us is my supervisor let’s just call him John (M30). So we all get along, my supervisor is chill and he is definitely one of the lenient supervisors compared to the other ones. After a month of working here, we were all chatting during our break and John was telling us that he’s glad that he got a hardworking and cooperative team. We were talking about our first impresses of everyone and I can’t get over him saying about me (I go by Des), “my first impression of Des is that she’s a hardworking single mom just trying to hold down the fort.” Everyone started laughing and my fellow black co worker (she’s a grandma) said “is it cuz she’s black.” And everyone started laughing. I felt so embarrassed I didn’t say anything but I just awkwardly laughed it off. Everyone else got better first impressions, he was saying to that other older black woman “my impression of you was that you’re the sweetest grandma that everyone enjoys seeing at the potluck and boy I was right!” (This assumption was true about her, she made food for us for a recent office party we had at work.) And the other assumptions about my other co workers were more positive just like that except for mine. For example, an Indian woman works here too and she’s 23 years old and he said jokingly “my first impression of her was that does her parents know she’s working here?” (Because she does look really young I too thought she was right out of high school.)

I guess I’m more upset because I’m the true stereotype in the black community. To be honest I always thought it was a norm to be a single mom and that relationships don’t last and that a woman just ends up taking more of the child work load because that’s my reality. This is the reality in the black community. This is what I knew growing up and this is everyone’s situation that I know personally and myself included (along with my pears at my school, my friends, my family in the black community also in this situation). Until I went to college and started working that’s when I started seeing and meeting more people outside of the black community (recently been exposed to more people outside of my community in the last few years like white, asian, Indian, middle eastern) that have more of a “normal reality” like marriage, kids, 50/50 dynamic. Don’t take me the wrong way, I’m speaking of my own personal experience. I’m not saying every single black person or white person is like this or that. I’ve certainly met white women that are also single moms as well. But I’m speaking antidotally of my experience that compared to my community(black) we do have more single parents and broken homes than other groups. But it wasn’t until I already had my kids I realized this wasn’t the right way to live life but now the damage is done and it’s too late. 

I know my supervisor didn’t say that in bad faith or to be an asshole. It just came off wrong and I took it personally. He’s honestly a really nice guy. But it did stick with me and I can’t get it out of my head. It really made me reevaluate, rethink, and look back at some of my decisions I’ve made. I even started to watch a lot of Kevin Samuel’s content to cope and see other black women in my situation and I wish I found his videos sooner, maybe things would have been different. I use to get irritated when of my friends use to complain about going back and fourth from her moms and dads house and I was like at least you get to see both of your parents, for us we don’t even have a dad or if we do then they don’t want to see us and they just dump us on our moms. I also look back and a lot of people assume I’m a mom even when I don’t tell them. I guess I just look like a mom or have that mom bod. 

My last thoughts of this is if I was at least divorced I would feel better about being a single mom. People look at me strange especially in the dating scene when I bring up I have kids and a conversation about that takes place and they ask questions and I have to be truthful and say I’ve never been married and everyone looks at me crazy that I had kids by short term guys I was seeing without having a serious commitment like marriage. To be honest I just wasn’t thinking about all that in the moment when it all happened. I didn’t know all of this was important especially because this is exactly how I grew up too and everyone around me grew up like this so I just thought it was the usual. I was so young and careless when this all happened and I was just finding myself. I hope now that I truly know myself and now that I have gained all this experience and knowledge, I hope that a man will take me as am and make me a wife and be a step father to my children.

"Hey, I’m sorry you feel so badly about it. From what I can understand, wasn’t it your black coworker that said its cos you’re black and not your supervisor? During your time at work has there been any point that indicated you’re a single mum and he didn’t make any assumption? When you never mention the children’s father or a boyfriend/husband then i think it’s fair to assume you’re a single mum and so I wouldn’t take that so personally or it’s because you’re black. I would assume the same thing about any colour woman. For eg I’m sure you have to be sorting out childcare like leaving work early or something and then you tell them about your weekend which involved stories of the kids and never mention a bf or father then it’s just 1 + 1 = 2 at that point. 

Agree with the other comment that you can’t live your life based on what ifs. You’ve got your two beautiful children now and you have to move forward. I would stay away from Kevin Samuels because he speaks in a way to purposefully put down people who aren’t in ideal situations. Sure, we can all agree you made some mistakes but you don’t need to be shamed for that. It’s only upwards from here. There are wayyy more positive feminity and relationship coaches out there that would be better for you.

I was once in the same boat. I had 2 kids…2 baby daddy’s and thought that was just the way it would be forever. I ended up meeting my husband and my life changed drastically. We’ve been together almost 8 years now and he has put in so much work to help change the narrative. I’m now a stay at home mom…something I never thought would be possible. I still struggle with this weird imposter syndrome because I really can’t wrap my mind around the fact that I’m a married, successful, at home mom with a loving husband who provides for me and the kids without all the extra drama and BS. Im currently working on my Bachelors degree through an online university and looking forward to moving on to my Masters. I say all this to say…don’t get so comfortable with the struggle that you forget that life can and will change for you one day. Keep doing what you do but always be open to change and improvement. Change doesn’t have to mean finding a good man, change can come from doing whatever it is you have to do to make life better for you and your children. Don’t count yourself out or get too content with your current situation because there is so much more you can achieve whether it be alone or with a partner.	jijigege	reply	na	na	na	0.9977136850357056	weak	strong	no	na	blackladies

"Don’t be embarrassed, black people are canaries in the coal mine. Everything we experience, white peoples eventually experience. 

In the 60s and 70s, there was talk about low marriage and high divorce rates in the black community, now white people are facing it too. In the 80s and 90s, the drug epidemic was a black issue, now opioids are recking white communities. The troubled and dangerous young man was a black community problem, now every week white people worry about one of their own boys gunning down their children at school.

"1) Your supervisor is very inappropriate. Even if his dull ass brain thought this about you, he should have in no way, as a leader, brought it up and spoke that nonsense to you. I’m not saying that he implied single motherhood is bad, but “stereotypes” don’t belong in the workplace and it was a shitty game. He needs to be more professional. I’m sorry he made you feel that way even if it wasn’t his intention. It was WRONG. 

2) We are all filled with some regrets. Some people regret who they married, some people regret not having kids because they never married. All you can do is do right by your children and teach them the right way. 

Lastly) Kevin Samuels ain’t shit. He feeds off of the degradation of black women. He was a jealous messy queen that probably wished he were one of us.

"Your post really struck a chord with me. It's not the same, but I grew up in poverty. We lived in a working class, safe and clean neighborhood, adjacent to one of the town's ghettos.

My parents were the absolute fucking worst with money. They got busted SO MANY TIMES by the police for having expired tags, expired license, no insurance. Once it was literally right in front of our house 5' from the driveway. 

Our lights would get cut off from time to time. Phone would get cut off. Food insecurity, or eating ramen noodles and spaghetti and soup made of potatoes and water every single week. House was a mess. 

I totally thought this was normal. Just the way life is. Nothing wrong.

I remember the having the realization that this is NOT a normal life. That it's not normal to have cars breaking down or no transportation all the time. Or to have nothing in the house but a couple cans of tomato soup. Or to have utilities cut off. Or drive around with expired fucking tags. 

I got out of there. Did pretty well for myself. But the regret is constant. If I had KNOWN that something was wrong, that this was not normal, that it's not wrong to expect better...my life would be different. I would have made different choices and not approached certain things from a mindset of poverty and ignorance. 

It's pathetic, really and I mourn for that child who didn't even know enough to be embarrassed.

We can't go back and undo the choices we have made. It's that door locking us out of our real potential that is so immensely sad."	jijigege	reply	na	na	na	0.9977136850357056	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
"I read a stat in one of my university textbooks stating that 28% of black households are headed by single mothers, in comparison with 22% of white households. And that number is steadily increasing for white women. This stereotype that all black women are single parents is just that, a racist stereotype. 

Also, I’m never going to be sorry that black women aren’t willing to stick around and put up with bullshit the way women of other races are. According to the same textbook, black women are often college educated (69%) and higher paid where other groups of women are not, so it’s easier for us to leave."	jijigege	reply	na	na	na	0.9977136850357056	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
"There’s a lot to unpack here. I’ll start with this:

1) Stop watching Kevin Samuels. He was a misogynistic idiot. 

2) people will always have preconceived assumptions or notions. In your recap it sounds like your coworker, not your boss mentioned your race? Not defending him or her, but wondering if the multiple comments affected you. As someone previously mentioned, if in passing you’ve spoken about your kids, as many moms often do, his may have picked up on you being a single parent if you didn’t mention a partner, father, husband. He also may have noticed if you don’t wear a ring depending on the region you’re in.

3) for many people, being a single mom is “normal”. I understand there are stereotypes, but your experience growing up and your experience now doesn’t mean you’re not normal or your kids aren’t. It sounds like you’re a hardworking and reflective person - great attributes to have. I say this as someone who is divorced and was married and chose to walk away. Too many women get caught up in the idea of what is “normal” by society’s standards. Being married with a child if you aren’t with a partner that values and respects you doesn’t bring anything beneficial to you or your children. 

At the end of the day, what you think of yourself matters the most. Be kinder to yourself and recognize the powerful things in your life you’re able to invest time and energy into, including your two little ones."	jijigege	reply	na	na	na	0.9977136850357056	no	no	no	na	blackladies
"I think it definitely depends on your upbringing. As a Black American woman (28 years old) (with a caribbean mom…only saying this bc some people might say I’m not of the same demographic), I grew up with both of my parents. Most of my friends are black and/or Latino and all of them have both parents. The first person I got close to with only one parent in the picture is my now ex. And I guess technically, my best friend, but she’s adopted by her mom who never married and never got pregnant. 

I have only two friends who are  legitimate single moms (and one is only half black). Anyone else is married with kids, just married, or childless…but again. These are the people I grew up with for the most part. People who just also didn’t see that growing up as much. 

I wish this wasn’t such a norm in our community. I don’t want to demonize single motherhood but I also want better for us so situations like this don’t happen, and further, won’t sting as much knowing it’s true.

All this to say, this doesn’t have to be the standard for you or anyone else. You can still get married. You can still find happiness as a single mother, too. It is what it is. But you make your own story."	jijigege	reply	na	na	na	0.9977136850357056	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

You have NOTHING to be ashamed of! Even being divorced doesn’t change being a single mother after the divorce. Most young girls don’t know about how important having two parents involved in the lives of their children is if it’s not your life experience. The thing that has to happen now is that you are raising your babies in a wholesome, loving home. Maybe you will get married and maybe not only the future can tell. I pray that your children get to know their father and their extended families. They deserve to have that familial connection and know who they are. One day you will be gone and they will be alone.

"I’m black, Nigerian for context sake, and I’ve always been told not to put myself in a situation that would create a child if I wasn’t married. This is what I’ll tell my children (without the threat of being disowned) because I believe it to be sound advice, but that can’t be the only criteria, or even the most important, to leading a respectable life. 

See, I’m from a “broken” home. I would always lie and say my father worked overseas when kids would ask where he was, but in reality, he was down the road canoodling with another woman after completely abandoning us. So even though my mother was married, she was a woman raising her kids alone attached to a man she was unlucky to have trusted-same as you. After all, No woman wakes up and says, “I wanna raise kids all on my own with no support!” 

In my culture, marriage is always emphasized, being a good wife is key, but no one really speaks about being a good husband. Even though I consider myself kinda smart (not smarter) for not being in your situation, I consider myself stupid for ever thinking marriage would automatically protect me from strife. 

If my future daughter were to become pregnant, I’d much rather her be a single mother than to stay with a man who emotionally or physically mistreats her. She made a mistake that led to a blessing. Getting rid of or abandoning the life she created is more detrimental to her character than a momentary lapse in judgment, in my opinion. Maybe a driving force in you being a good mother is that you don’t have those trash men in your life draining you of your energy and positivity. You’re older; you’re wiser. That’s why you’re even contemplating these things in the first place. Because of your upbringing and the perception you had on life, you did the best you could. 

Anyway, my main points are: stereotypical assumptions are an unfair way to assess anyone even if you’re right 1/10 times. You’re worth isn’t dependent on the worth of the people you’re attached to, just your intentions and effort. A single mother is simply a woman who has a complicated history but stepped up when a man stepped down. Your future is bright. 

The only things I think black women should fight against is A. Letting deadbeat men into our lives, especially if they already have kids they don’t take care of. That’s not something we should be overlooking the way we do. B. Having unprotected sex with men that are waving several red flags. You can’t change him no matter how much love you give. Doing these two things won’t protect you from heartache, but it will reduce the chances of you experiencing it."	jijigege	reply	na	na	na	0.9977136850357056	no	strong	no	na	blackladies

I am a 24 year old lady and i grew up with a lighter skinned mother . When i was around 12-13 i bleached my skin and my mother encouraged it by buying me skin lightening products , my dad found out about this a few months later and immediately got me to stop and he was pretty upset at my mom for encouraging it. Now that i am 24, i sometime have a hard time accepting that i am dark skinned, I sometimes struggle with finding myself pretty because of it. some other days i find that i don’t care for my skin and i appreciate my skin tone but most days i struggle. It really messes up with my self esteem and worse of all , my butt is way darker than the rest of my body, i honestly find it so disgusting , i barely even wear shorts or bikinis because of it .

"Context: I am in my mid 30s and I finally managed to meet someone, also mid 30s, somewhat organically after unsuccessful OLD for the past 5 or so years. It felt so good to meet someone naturally via a Black oriented activity group. He is attractive, fun/funny, good career, intentional and our chemistry has felt so natural. This is the first person in a LONG time where I was like shiiit... This might be IT!

He is divorced and was married to a white woman for a while. His mom is Black and father is of white European descent. No relationship with the father. This person was raised in an environment that was roughly 2% Black while I grew up in a major city, incredibly diverse. 

Recently he has expressed some sentiments that have resulted in heated debates OR he will allude to an opinion but not pursue a discussion because he knows or has an idea on my stance (affirmative action, reparations, race-based activities). Then he will end it by saying something like, I hope you don't think I have issues with my Blackness or I'm a bigot or something. 😐

So, some of his opinions feel hypocritical and not fully formed (i.e. you think race based community groups should be open to anyone and shouldn't exclude anyone otherwise they shouldn't exist? That's how we met! 🤔). He is also from a ""red state/region"" and some friends emerged as tRump supporters which he cut off but that's bare minimum ya know. 

Anyway, I am trying to give him the benefit of the doubt given where he grew up, who he grew up around (mom often gone for work), and that fact that he was with a WW for a while since there weren't many options where they are from. He is very opinionated and stubborn so I'm hoping he has the capacity to learn and broaden his mindset but I'm starting to see a disconnect from the Black community and he feels like America is race obsessed, and that it shouldn't matter which I think makes no sense. Unfortunately it does still matter in many ways and trying to deny that is foolish. 

How would you approach this? Be patient and try to educate? Is it too late? I honestly don't feel like doing the emotional labor either ... And I don't want anymore arguments. I date Black men to have a common understanding about certain things. We have other disagreements but I take this very personally and I'm trying to figure out a gentler way to approach this. Given my age, I really don't want to waste time but given that there is pee and poop in the dating pool I'm trying to see it through."	lovelyflowerduck	post	23.01086008383396	male	White	0.0018545539351180196	na	na	na	21	blackladies
Unless you're being paid, it's not your job to teach grown adults. If they wanted to learn, they would, you can't change people and shouldn't feel like you are expected to.	lovelyflowerduck	reply	na	na	na	0.0018545539351180196	no	no	no	na	blackladies
"Not pee and poop in the dating pool!! 😭😭😭

First want to note that while his upbringing and appearance is relevant to how he came to be who he is and believe what he does, I just want to remind that all skinfolk ain’t kinfolk and that some number of black American men have wild and crazy beliefs. 

To me the biggest questions are 1) whether you all can have discourse about these topics/differences in a mutual and expansive way and 2) whether you can accept the differences that do arise/which differences are a no-go or a fundamental difference in values. 

To point 1) I hear you about not wanting to do emotional labor or teaching especially about things that are extremely fundamental and basic to you. I’m wondering whether it might feel that way bc when it comes up, the convo is shutdown or you all come to feel like adversaries or opponents vs the convos being welcomed and approached by both with curiosity and humility. Bc in the first instance, it basically feels like fighting with someone to not only hear or care abt something v important to you but also to convince a seemingly uninterested or unwilling person of your humanity..all while trying to navigate relationship dynamics. That’s exhausting and depressing and invalidating. But sadly a lot of people are taught that differences are sources of threat and need to be shut down. In the second instance with humility and curiosity, then it becomes like any other semi-vulnerable conversation about each other’s lives and beliefs and values where you are both interested and excited to learn more about each other and seek mutual understanding about how your differences have impacted you and how you see the world. And perhaps both gain new insights that open new doors or challenge old ways of thinking. In this case, y’all are working together to grow and learn and be encouraged and validated in your vulnerability. Of course, approaching it in the second way can be really hard or new for some people..do you think shifting in that way would be possible (and desired) in you alls relationship? 

To point 2 tho) you have to decide within yourself which differences actually are unacceptable to you. Bc even if you all start having open, mutual, expensive conversations abt these things, if he ends up revealing that he strongly and unapologetically believes some extremely heinous thing that impacts how he views and interacts with the world and others and that he is not at all open to questioning or shifting that view, then that’s an important incompatibility that has been revealed. 

Overall, the nature of relationships is that differences will keep coming up. How you approach them matters a lot but it’s ultimately up to you what you’re willing to accept."	lovelyflowerduck	reply	na	na	na	0.0018545539351180196	no	no	no	na	blackladies

">Then he will end it by saying something like, I hope you don't think I have issues with my Blackness or I'm a bigot or something.

Loooordt, I can't stand a passive aggressive man lol

I don't think where he grew up, who he grew up around and the fact that he was married to a WW means all that much. It's his beliefs that are giving you pause, so that has to do with him on the inside. A person with those same circumstances as him can also be biracial but have a completely different view/outlook on life. 

Based on experiences I've had with biracial friends and potential dates, some are more confused than others. Some want to be Black when it's convenient (i.e. filling out college scholarship applications) and then lament why they aren't accepted by their yt peers while others just ignore the one race over the other and are happy to say they are Black. 

So the main thing for me is that he's giving me Asian Bae from Insecure vibes in that he can't buck up and say his opinions to you and would rather have lingering tension between you. Personally, I like a guy who can give it back, tell me no and have some differing views and not be afraid to say so. I'd actually respect it more if dude just came out and said how he really thinks about race relations (and to his credit he seems to have in some ways). But since he feels that America is too ""race focused"" I'd next right there. That has to do with how you're treated in life, what opportunities are available to you (to a certain extent), if your life is on the line...

"For me the key to a successful relationship where there are political differences is openness and willingness to communicate. Having differing opinions that come from different life experiences isn’t wrong in of itself. 
But it sounds like he hasn’t worked through some of the racism and biases that we all internalize since we live in a biased society. Depending on where you are on your own journey of self acceptance, this could be A TON of work that you’d have to support him through."	lovelyflowerduck	reply	na	na	na	0.0018545539351180196	weak	no	no	na	blackladies
"Eh, you have your opinions and he has his. You don't have to agree with everything. Maybe his opinions will change due to more life experiences, maybe not. Nothing he says to me sound like a deal breaker. You just don't agree on certain things. If it's a deal breaker to you for him to not change, than you know what you need to do.

I find that, the older I get, the more I understand how most people are stubborn about their beliefs. No amount of reasonable debate will change that. I say this as a person who have had a good many debates where I gave enough information that really supported my side, and the other persons even agreed at the end... only to find that later on, same topic comes up again and those persons still held those beliefs. It was pretty much like most of those discussions were meaningless. I now debate just to debate with the understanding that there will be no altering of opinions."	lovelyflowerduck	reply	na	na	na	0.0018545539351180196	weak	no	no	na	blackladies

"Thank you for such a thoughtful and thorough response! So many good points.

We definitely become adversaries on this topic and I get annoyed when I feel like he is under informed. Sometimes he has a strong opinion without strong facts essentially.  I will set some boundaries and encourage more ✨curiosity✨ because right now it's just a debate, neither of us are really asking questions to understand and the defensiveness becomes intense. He feels like I get mad at him over an opinion but it's deeper than that. The last time we had a conversation about boundaries, I brought this up and said this isn't a generic topic, and I get worked up because it's very personal to me. He seemed to get it but only time will tell."	lovelyflowerduck	follow-up	na	na	na	0.0018545539351180196	weak	strong	no	na	blackladies

"Yes he does look Black... brown-skinned, kinky hair, black features... but people aren't surprised when they learn that he is biracial. 

Yes we live in a diverse city but he just moved here 5 years ago, which is how we met. He spent the majority of his life in the non-diverse area.

"You don't have to agree with everything but getting a ""why is America obsessed with race?"" Is totally different. Uninformed, willfully ignorant, confused- shows completely different values imo this is something that is fine while dating casually.

"Rule of thumb: ONLY date men that have a specific “type” or “preference”. They know what they want and like. When a man is attracted to every race and type of woman, he doesn’t know what he wants in all aspects of life. 

When it comes to BM, only date the ones that ONLY date other BW. (My father told me this!)

Ex. He’s only dated tall BW with small tits (and u are a tall BW with small tits)

Even when I date outside my race, I use this rule…"	lovelyflowerduck	reply	na	na	na	0.0018545539351180196	no	no	no	na	blackladies

"He sounds like a

""Caleb""
""Trevor"" Kind of guy.  
(Edit: douchey but ""means well"") 



I've had experiences with the kind of biracial guy you're talking about and it feels sooo familiar. I dated a white guy and went the educate route. I was young in my 20s then. Long story short, it ended badly. We almost got married and I'm thankful I didnt.


A few questions: how does his mom feel about HER BLACKNESS? 
Does she know about you? 
Does she date black men?
How did she feel living in their town?
Did she ever give him ""the police talk"" ? 

When you describe him, I just think of Uncle Ruckus's mom."	lovelyflowerduck	reply	na	na	na	0.0018545539351180196	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
"Interesting!!! Yes I would say semi-douchey at times and unaware of the implications of some of his opinions but it doesn't seem like it's coming from a place of malice.

We are only 4-5 months in so I have not met his mom yet. I do not think she knows about me. I'm ok with that for now since we are still in the dating stage and I don't feel like we are ready for a relationship. 

They lived in that city due to the nature of her work and other family being there for some time. I'm not sure about the police talk, but he understands police brutality/BLM/and has protested... But that's why I am so perplexed by him. His stances/world view feels incongruous. He also said he experienced racism for the first time living in our city which he didn't growing up even though they were one of the few Black families. So I understand most issues are nuanced and all that, but this is different - it feels inconsistent, sometimes hypocritical... All over the place somehow. 

My guess is he is trying to reconcile his identity and how the world views him with how he views the world. And his comment about race obsession in the US and a desire for everyone to move on feels like it would either 1) make him feel like he fits in more or 2) date who he wants without perceived judgement.... 🤔"	lovelyflowerduck	follow-up	na	na	na	0.0018545539351180196	no	no	no	na	blackladies
Yeah, this answered many questions I was trying to get to by asking about his appearance. I can tell you that as a kid, I didn't like identifying as black. I'm not biracial. I grew up in a black hood. I was constantly bullied that I wasn't black right by liking the music I liked, being a good student. By college, I had an awakening that categorically changed me at a cellular level. I owned my blackness. I did a lot of the same minimizing you describe. I had the same irritations about constant race talk. I just wanted to be like everyone else, especially since I mostly had white friends. I know he's grown, and I was a kid, but the situations sound comparable. Though I lived in a black neighborhood, I was surrounded by black kids who bullied me. That affected my view of blackness. He was surrounded by white folks and had little interaction with black folks. So it almost sounds like he's in this youthful discovery period regarding blackness. It sounds like he may have developed this way of thinking to be accepted in his white environs. He may not have wanted to rock the boat and either dismissed or was unaware of racist attitudes around him. Being in a diverse area is new to him. His beliefs may shift as he acclimates to not being the only black dude  Or not. Maybe he'll remain hypocritical and unclear. You have to decide what you need and are willing to tolerate.	lovelyflowerduck	reply	na	na	na	0.0018545539351180196	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
"I think this actually has a lot to do with it! This definitely reminds me of some stories he has shared and I think he was trying to fit in. He also had cousins that would clown him for listening to White bands/music or watching certain shows, on top of that he is kind of a nerd. 

I feel like the rock the boat comment is spot on also, being that he was surrounded by so many white conservatives. So yeah, that's what I'm wondering... Whether some of his beliefs will shift a little, now that he is in an environment that is very different than before."	lovelyflowerduck	follow-up	na	na	na	0.0018545539351180196	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
I got clowned by my cousins, by kids at church, kids on my block, black kids at school, at camp. I came up during the genesis of hip hop, which I loved. But I had very eclectic and wide ranging taste in music. The commentary about listening to “white” music was relentless. I hated thinking about race and definitely let fd up statements from white folks slide.	lovelyflowerduck	reply	na	na	na	0.0018545539351180196	no	strong	no	na	blackladies
