Some of you might know that Florida is planning to teach its youth, that black people benefited from slavery. This is very bad and I mean bad because this is is literally the equivalent of an abused father telling it‚Äôs mentally scared child that ‚Äúeven tho I abused you I taught you how fish‚Äù it‚Äôs ridiculous. Second of all they are trying to bring in this new narrative to make the youth especially the young black youth ignorant of their past, and to uphold white supremacist ideals on how African Americans learned skills from slavery. What I find funny is how people will always be so quick to gaslight us black people when it comes to our trauma yet they would never do this if it was the Holocaust.

"Yeah... American fascism requires the whites be flawless and beyond reproach. Its the ideology of the psychopath, the mentally deranged and DeSantis and his followers exhibit all the signs of the mentally unwell. So while my gut wants violence, there must be a reasoned and intelligent approach to countering this fuckery.  


They banned books in school so a statewide literacy program that pushes african american children to read their true history is necessary. The NAACP, the African american state representatives and the rest of those folks need to get more books in more children's hands. More readings to small kids in libraries and parks. Maybe  ""reading rainbow"" tour buses where young folks are paid to go out to read to kids on their blocks while giving out books.

"It's not comparable because the holocaust is 'white' history, so it's classed as more important. When white people suffer the media has to be involved (see Ukraineüñïüèævs russia) as opposed to Syria or Palestine. 

Even though the slave trade benefitted most white people today (either directly or indirectly) they have to accept it was wrong, so better not to discuss it as they can't do that. They always have to be right, that's the key. Either don't teach about slavery, or make it positive. But they can talk about the holocaust all day because it was white people killing (predominantly) white people, so no guilt.

Furthermore, the guilt isn't guilt as a normal person would feel guilt. Their guilt is self serving, to give in to guilt would open the door to reparations, a potential shift in world powers (because for sure America, England and Europe should owe Africa and the Caribbean their entire gdp). But most of all, to admit to guilt, would mean they are not the best/default humans.  Ever since the Enlightenment these fucks have been thinking the same way, education is just the latest way they get us to a '1984' state ü§¶üèæ 

They remove enough of the past for one or two generations and its gone forever. No one that survived being a slave made it back to Africa. The slaves that got free weren't able to tell everyone what their actual names were. This is the first step to rewriting history to their benefit, once that happens we are truly lost."

The Holocaust is European sin. Chattel slavery is an American one. American atrocities are routinely glossed over. Native Americans, Black people, Asians, Latinos, Queer folk, the disabled, and various European ethnic groups have been systematically abused and discriminated against.

"Imo, the best solution to this is to start practicing group economics. We have to start being selfish with our dollar and start investing more into our communities. Many sources have claimed that our dollar circulates for less than six hours in our communities, which is obviously a problem. Almost every other race of people will purposefully spend with their own people‚Ä¶..we as black people in this country do not. As someone else here said, we must invest in our own hospitals, schools, supermarkets, and police force. Additionally, we gotta establish our own banks and manufacturing / distribution facilities and stores so our people will have somewhere to buy basic needs. For example, instead of buying our hair products from Asian people selling products tailored to us, we need to instead buy from the black owner selling products intended for us. I want to emphasize that strictly doing business and helping only our communities in NOT being racist as some may think. What other groups of people invest in black communities if it isn‚Äôt beneficial to them monetarily somehow? None. 

More about the Florida implementation though, it‚Äôs absolutely absurd and insulting to African Americans dead and alive. For Florida to start downplaying the effects of slavery on our people and their offspring and to have the nerve to want to teach Florida children it was actually advantageous for us is honestly more proof that this country is getting worse (not that it was ever good to begin with) and never liked black people. We should‚Äôve never allowed the schools to teach us about our history anyways because of course, they‚Äôre trying to save face and keep black people from knowing our true history. Tbh though, I doubt if white folks even know the history anyways. Instead of our history being taught where slavery began, that history could start at Mansa Musa, the richest person to ever live. But only we can teach our kids these things either through the creation of our own self funded schools or through home schooling."	JKpatakpa15	reply	na	na	na	0.999488115310669	no	no	no	na	blackmen

I don't buy this at all.  You seem to be implying that African-Americans should just be happy that we're in America instead of Africa not acknowledging the fact that white folks plundered (and continues) to plunder Africa for its gold, diamonds, oil, ivory, and rubber.  But, for you, ""the results wouldn't be much different"" if that happened.  I am so sick of people thinking that black folks should just be content with their station, content with the scraps that white folks throw at us when their tables sag and overflow with the riches of our labor.

You're handwaving away the separation of black mothers from their children, the dissolution of black families, the murders, the beatings, and torture. Some of this [continues to this day](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/six-mississippi-officers-plead-guilty-torture-case-two-black-men-rcna99776).

You even compared coming to America to ""lotteries"" and the ""mega millions"".  These are your words.

Dating as a black man is weird, you automatically have a stereotype that you‚Äôre more masculine. That can either help or hurt you. Helps by giving women a more initial interest in you cause you have societal edge, but if you don‚Äôt live up to it, that persecute you more than a guy from a another races that‚Äôs the same as you. You have expectations to live up to, but if you live up to them you have easier time, you have a harder time if you don‚Äôt.

I don‚Äôt recommend anyone getting married before 30, by then you should‚Äôve gotten all the fun and curiosity out of your system. 

As far as meeting women‚Ä¶.usually you just have to get out, preferably with friends. Maybe it‚Äôs just me but women had a tendency to notice me when I was socializing with friends, as opposed to being alone somewhere.

And lastly, if you‚Äôre open to women of other races‚Äîgive them a try if it appeals to you. There‚Äôs a variety of women out there, and plenty of beautiful ones to experience.

"Do whatever you can to make yourself as attractive as possible, inside and out. The easiest way to do that is by getting in shape. Lose weight and get to the natural weight for your height, after that start bulking up and building some muscle. Your diet will be the most important aspect if weight-loss, not the working out. Look up and try healthy diets that look appetizing to you. Keep your grooming in order, wear clothes that fit and suit you well. This is the easiest way to make yourself more attractive and get more attention from women.

The second is the hardest but not impossible with honest introspection and thats fine tuning how you approach and talk to people. You may need therapy or to be on medication, doesn‚Äôt make you any less of a man in fact lesser men choose to struggle with their problems and never address them so be better. I had an old friend who was morbidly obese for years and he started working out and went from +300 lbs to weighing less than I did at 225 (he was taller than me too). He thought that he would finally start getting women and while he did attract more women once they saw his personality they ran for the hills. He didn‚Äôt see anything wrong with how he talked to people and a lot of his bigoted views (like being a misogynist) were just extremely off putting which explains why were no longer friends.

Since I‚Äôm also 21 and black imma give you advice I wish I could tell 17 year old me before I took dating seriously. If a women likes you, you don‚Äôt have to try or do anything to be with her. What does that mean? Well that means, that when a women truly likes you she‚Äôll put out for you, she‚Äôll impress you, she‚Äôll put her best foot forward and try to make you feel loved, wanted and respected. The same you‚Äôd do for a woman you liked. I‚Äôd also say please please please don‚Äôt stay with a woman who starts out bitchy or disrespectful because she‚Äôll be like that throughout the entire relationship. Who she was at the beginning is who she‚Äôll be at the end. Finally if you want to attract more women I‚Äôd say the easiest way is meeting women who are into the same stuff as you and brainstorming where you can go to meet people who are also into that stuff. That way you and the lady have a common interest, can build a solid friendship and hopefully a relationship. Don‚Äôt sweat it have fun. Dating is supposed to be fun remember that.

We have to be realistic.

Physical attraction is very important. It's closer to 30-50% of dating and rightfully so. Unattractive men pulling attractive women are an outlier and chances are the women genuinely find them attractive. Those are attractive men, just not attractive to you. 

Women have too many options to make personality everything. You can just stay friends if personality was the only thing. Relationships require physical, emotional, and mental attractions in various ratios.

When we can be realistic about this, it makes discussions about dating and attraction easier."	dcw125	reply	na	na	na	0.0020955505315214396	no	strong	no	na	blackmen

"Throughout my life, I‚Äôve realized that being a black man warrants its own experience and, that other races usually had it relatively ‚Äòeasier‚Äô than black men. This can be true in a diverse set of categories like relationships, job search, day-to-day interactions and more‚Ä¶

 One of the cases that really highlighted that for me was when I was back in high school. I had this buddy who was half Latino half white guy who was a good friend of mine. And One thing I noticed about him is that the way he‚Äôs received within other communities is rather positive, even among black people he‚Äôs much more liked than I am. I remember when him and I were interested in taking the same girl to Prom. We were all sitting in a circle and my name came up as a potential date to prom, and she quickly said that she wouldn‚Äôt be attending, but as soon as my friend asks her out her response changed and she started to entertain the idea of going to prom. 

I also have a similar case except the girl was a childhood friend of mine, we were mad cool with each other and our parents were very interconnected. After I changed schools, everything changed. She would no longer greet me in the hallways, and would always be so annoyed when looking at me. She was also very pro-black which was one of the things that I found to be cool about her, but this all changed when I saw her demeanour towards me and her demeanour towards the white guys that approach her. When talking to me she‚Äôs so tense and disgusted, but when talking to the white dudes she changes into a completely different person. All of a sudden she‚Äôs soft-spoken, and an overall incredible human being. She even offered to braid the hair of the white guy that has bullied me throughout middle school and high school. Seeing that did hurt me, but knowing where we stood I kind of had to swallow that.

I also realized that the barrier of entry for a lot of black men seems to be much higher than any other race. Non-black dudes can get away with being skinny, unathletic, and broke. While black guys have to have an Austin Dunham physique, while also having a crap ton of money in the bank to even be considered a potential mate. I remembered asking my friend how he was able to have that effect on the girls he talked to, and he would always chalk it up to him being able to ‚Äòhandle his business‚Äô, but that doesn‚Äôt make sense since we are both relatively broke. He was just able to get away with things somehow‚Ä¶ I could be wrong, but I truly believe being non-black can compensate for things while being black means that you have to compensate for things by doing the things that I‚Äôve mentioned above. As I‚Äôm typing I can‚Äôt think of one black man that isn‚Äôt super ripped or super rich that is propped up on social media. Meanwhile, I can name countless of non-black guys that are propped up as sex symbols whilst having an average frame or even a dad bod.

I think it depends on what type of women OP is chasing and where one lives. Also I think his issues seem to dig a bit deeper than just dating. Moreso existing. I‚Äôm willing to bet he lives up there in New England or the Midwest where being a black man is HARD. Simply because it‚Äôs a very white part of the country. And when you aren‚Äôt around much of your own people. And you start comparing your lifestyle,features, and attributes to white people who will be different in all aspects. Those feelings of not belonging can set in. And when you get negative reinforcements like friends or peers of another race seemingly doing just fine, you start to feel like it‚Äôs your race that‚Äôs the issue. When in reality it isn‚Äôt, and OP is just in the wrong place where he indeed doesn‚Äôt belong, and should focus on moving to a place where being black is much more desirable and welcome. I plan on doing this myself, I gotta get the hell out of upstate NY. And this isn‚Äôt just a black issue. People of color in general have talked about feeling like this. Especially Asians who are even less represented and make up a smaller percentage of the population than black people. I hope this comment makes more sense.

I can tell you that I don't carry a lot of the anger that other bm/bw do, which I guess suggests I inherited the aloof attitude white people have towards the world.

"Hmm interesting question.

At home I had mostly friends who were black from when I was little until around age 8 because I moved houses. Now, I only had to rely on school friends, which was at a majority white school. Which lasted from K-8 then in highschool went to all black one. As for growing up around white people, ehhh, it didn't really work out. They didn't like me that much, so I moved on. Not to say I was hated but I definitely wasn't any white person's favorite person.

Now, my friend groups going forward were more diverse. Like we had black people, Asian people, Hispanic people, some white people who were cool and not obnoxiously white. Gay, straight, bisexual. I just started collecting people like they were pokemon. 

As for the effects on my psyche, it has made me more of a multiculturalist since I grew up around people who weren't like me. I don't really have the super pro black mindset. Like, don't get it twisted, I'm still pro black, just not in the more up in your face way. Beyond that I didn't really have a problem fitting in anywhere.

That's not my attitude at all. I've been crushing white people in intellectual pursuits my entire life. I know from lived experience they're no better than I and other black people. So, in everything I do, I start with the assumption I can excel at it if I work hard enough.

As I finished school my closest friends became the black kids that grew up the same way I did, or they were Asian, Hispanic, etc.

Because I grew up in a biracial household (had a black father in my life and a half German half Lebanese American stepfather, along with my black mom) it made it where my identity wasn‚Äôt wrapped up in my ethnicity. 

As I got older I became more aware of my identity as a black man. Even though I grew up with a dad who immersed me in black activism I wasn‚Äôt able to participate for most of my life due to my religious upbringing through my mom, until very recently. Now I‚Äôm more involved in community support services and am looking forward to doing more. 

The political climate has left black folks behind. Our poorest communities are destitute when it comes to adequate healthcare and education and I‚Äôd like to get more involved to change that. I see my ability to comfortably rub shoulders with both black people and white people as an asset towards organizing a solution."

"I'm a child of forced busing in the early 80s (like Ice Cube - his latent strangeness as a vassal isn't surprising). Right off the bus nearly everyday I was reminded that I was an outsider. W kids were not nice . Lots of fights, lots of fear and lots of trauma not only from being poor, but being a stranger in a strange land with people your age who want your destruction.

When we moved to Inglewood in the mid 80s, I was PTSD'd out. I couldn't relate to any of the black students so again, I was an outsider. Accused of speaking white, being white (I'm lightskinned)  and not being black enough, I joined up with a gang. Pops immediately pulled me out to live with him in the suburbs and again, I was an outsider. At the end of my high school year/beginning of college I joined the NOI and S1Ws (my parents were G&E so it was familiar).I graduated college and left a lot of that behind, married a black woman, and had kids.

That experience really made me distrustful which isolated me and hampered me.

"The only real experience was the casual overt or subtle racism. It didn't have any real impact otherwise; I was second generation to attend the district so a lot of teachers went to school with my family and some ended up at the big state college with them in 60-70s so it was generally fine.

During the summer and sometimes fall semester I would go to private school in DMV and it was either like 70% black people or the total opposite where I was like 2 of 10. In that case, there was a community in the school or amongst the families and since we were all similar class, education etc the environment was always positive, focused on strong self esteem, academic success, and exposing us to as much opportunities as possible."

"I'm honestly tired of seeing Black men get criticized for their dating choices whenever they choose to be with a White woman or any non-Black woman. I don't understand why some people feel the need to police another man's choices in who he chooses to be with. Black men aren't obligated to only date Black women, and that should be respected.

Personally, I'm not  interested in dating or marrying a White woman because they aren't my type, but I wouldn't shame other men for doing so. It's just weird for me to give a fuck about who another man is with.

I also see **some** Black women shaming these men, which is quite hypocritical. When a Black man dates a White woman, they often criticize it, but if it's the other way around (a Black woman dating a White man), they celebrate it and use phrases like ""She's going where she is celebrated or loved.""

And I'm sure you guys know what the divestment movement is.  I don't think I need to go into that any further.

For example, I remember on Twitter, people were making fun of Bronny for taking a White girl to prom, and they also shamed MBJ and Jonathan Majors for dating White women.

But that doesn't happen whenever a Black Women is dating a White man. Odd.

From my anecdotal experience educated Black women, especially the more militant feminist types tend to be with White men.

Black women and many black men say what they say about black men dating white women because of the ways in which some black men spent decades openly criticizing black women in juxtaposing their identity against non-black women as a way of shitting on black women.

To say that black women who date within their race are obsessed over non black men's physical appearances the way that many black men who date black women are obsessed with non-black women is ridiculous.

"Ok. I‚Äôm not entirely sure about this. In my experience ‚Äî I have a mixed race, white-appearing husband, Black men suddenly notice I‚Äôm attractive when I‚Äôm with my husband and then are either competitive with him or try and intimidate or even fight him. 

But if I‚Äôm with my white girlfriend who is objectively less attractive than me, most Black men ignore me and flirt with her and it‚Äôs always been that way with my white girlfriends. I swear my white girlfriends could have one eye and one leg and be covered in boils and they would go for her over me. 

I suddenly get a LOT more attention when I‚Äôm with my appearing-white husband. 

I honestly don‚Äôt care who anyone dates but there is definitely a ‚Äúhalo‚Äù still to this day for Black people in adding points to white people‚Äôs attractiveness just for being white. There has been a LOT of conditioning and it‚Äôs just part of language even. 

I think we‚Äôre getting better and getting more self esteem though. 

Also, I‚Äôm with my husband because all the Black men at my university where we met were not interested in me. They were too busy in those days (the 90s) trying to get white girls.

">Black women and many black men say what they say about black men dating white women because of the ways in which some black men spent decades openly criticizing black women in juxtaposing their identity against non-black women as a way of shitting on black women.

That would be understandable if you were referring to BM who did so, but that's not the sentiment we're talking about. I don't think any race of male is faced with being called a sellout, hated, and inundated with questions as we why they're dating interracially as Black men are. You can openly see this dynamic in the community, with successful Black men being shamed who have done none of the things you claim.

>like, to even pretend that black women are dating outside of their race to the same degree that black men are is absurd.

They don't, but they're very likely to surpass BM in the future - which mind you are a hyper minority of Black men anyway. 

> To say that black women who date within their race are obsessed over non black men's physical appearances the way that many black men who date black women are obsessed with non-black women is ridiculous

I don't even know what you're referring to here. Again, if they genuinely displayed that much affection for non-black women I'm failing to see why Black men who marry interracially are a minority and the vast majority marry Black women.

>We have all sat around groups of black men who are dating black women but obsessed over the physical bodies of non-black women

Nope, if those men are out there I assure you they're likely not with Black women. Wouldn't they likely just fall under the umbrella which we constantly hear of the few in the community who say ""I don't date Black women, x are better"" rather than this?

>The comments about white women, Asian women, nonblack Latinas having pretty hair, pretty facial features, pretty eyes.. being exotic.. This is the type of shit black men openly discuss and barber shops, locker rooms, you name it

To reiterate that's the few BM who don't date Black women. We have statistics showing most Black men get with Black women, so you can't use this hyper minority to paint this narrative. 

>Like, Why do y'all want to fight with black women and try to convince them that they're delusional? This is a community OVERWHELMING with men who would rather beef with the women in their community than do anything else, I'm convinced.

>In general, white women only turn to Black men as a last resort because they don‚Äôt meet white beauty standards (but are good enough for Black men)

Black men according to several studies have the most masculine and dominant face according to researchers, and when rated by women of all races either have the most attractive face or the second. Black men are also the most fetishized race in the US. You don't get such things with other races of men in the US, so the idea that we're not desirable, or at the very least not at the top is false. 

This narrative is also incorrect, because white supremacists are literally crying that so many White women are dating Black men, and we created the very notion of a cuck, which is generally a white dude who watches his partner sleep with typically a Black man. 

>or because they stand to gain money and status (which is why wealthy Black men have more access to white women than poor Black men).

Wealthy Black men have more access to White women than poor Black men because White women are the majority of females in the US and are represented more in the upper class than other races of women.

Very telling. 

Because romantic and social desirability are separate from physical and sexual desirability. Which is why the rates of interracial pornography and sex worker consumption among whites dwarf the rates of actual interracial marriages. 

Moreover, my point was about white women who don‚Äôt meet the beauty standards of a white society being able to pull Black men, not about Black men‚Äôs physical desirability.

">And yet, it was still predatory. Much like child rape during slavery: not uncommon.

That's true, but again, people were advocating against the ethical nature of slavery so much so that there were riots, violence, wars, and abolitionists. Millions of people in the North literally opposed it, and boycotts...etc began. The key difference here is large opposition existed since the beginning of it, teen marriage has been a thing since the beginning of civilization and there was no equivalent to that same level of opposition that slavery faced. We know marrying teenagers is bad due to science, not some inherent characteristic. Without science and modern thinking, why would teen marriage that isn't forced be wrong? Who's demonstrating this scientifically, or from an example? 

>Apply that logic to slavery in general, and see how far that argument gets you. Regardless of societal expectations, it was a predatory ‚Äúrelationship.‚Äù

No, because to reiterate people were aware slavery was bad. There is no equivalent to that regarding teen marriage, and at the very least the backing for that came largely toward the end with science. 

>Yes, it is. Two situations don‚Äôt have to be identical to be comparable.

That's true, but you specifically were comparing the element of sally hemings being a sex slave to teen marriage. While other aspects of the two are the same, like them both being underaged, Black, and women, to compare them in the manner you're doing is wrong. A forced 14-year-old slave with a 40-year-old man isn't comparable to a 17-year-old marrying a 23-year-old. Again, similarities exist I don't deny - Black, slave, woman. 

>I agree that this idea‚Äîwhich is neither what I said nor my point‚Äîis false. Black men have always been sexually available and desirable to white women (and men). It‚Äôs interesting that when I point out the circumstances under which white women romantically engage Black men, you pivot to a conversation about Black men‚Äôs physical desirability.

If you don't think there's an implication about the attractiveness of Black men by saying Black men get ugly white women that White men don't want then you're being dishonest. Me pointing out how Black men are desirable, so it's more than likely they find them um perhaps attractive rather than leaving their community because they're unattractive (makes no sense literally most incels are white though...) which you literally cannot demonstrate. 

>Because romantic and social desirability are separate from physical and sexual desirability. Which is why the rates of interracial pornography and sex worker consumption among whites dwarf the rates of actual interracial marriages.

I don't think interracial marriage works as a quantifier for your example at all. Black men are like 7% of the population, and marriage overwhelmingly is initiated by men. Black men largely don't want marriage, which is why Black women are the least married of all races of women. Most people are going to marry within their race because available options near you (often their race) are the biggest factor for marriage. It doesn't prove Black men are socially undesirable, most Americans are fine with interracial marriage. 

>False. Hispanic women are the poorest demographic of single women. Black women are proportionally the most educated and have on average 10 times the wealth of their single Black male counterparts. And yet, they‚Äôre less likely to date out. Hmmm.

Black women are the most educated. That's when compared to Black men, but with other groups of women, no. Asian women for instance attain more degrees alone, so I know that's straight-up false. It also inherently makes sense, their culture values education pretty much from birth. Even if you wanted to look at it from an economic standpoint, you'd expect that education significantly increases income, which is true, but the average Black woman earns below the average Black man whom are among the least educated and that's according to stats. 

https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/

For example shows Black men earn more hourly than Black women, though it could possibly be equaled in coming years, but again the notion is false they make more or have more wealth. You're probably right regarding Hispanic women being slightly below Black women, but I'm seeing mixed data. Source below shows hourly earnings, with Black men above Black women.

There's no law forcing you to be married, you're not threatened with violence, and king Henry doesn't have the ability to lock you in his sex dungeon. I could go on.

>Although this particular issue is scientifically demonstrable now, morality doesn‚Äôt need to be scientifically justified. People knew, for example, that slavery was wrong in spite of the scientific consensus that slavery was the natural condition of the negro.

People knew slavery was wrong because they could see the effects of it. Crying children, human beings brutally hurt by it, screaming and raped. Even the Pope condemned slavery, and many religious individuals did so as well. Regardless of whether the people adopted that position, they were well aware of the effects so much so that they wished to continue despite that which manifested into the civil war. I'm going to ask you if a 17-year-old marries a 23-year-old how is that bad without modern thinking and science? Was there large opposition to it? were people informed? Hell, we're still arguing what age gaps at what period are acceptable, though we obviously have a sort of baseline. It's wrong today to pursue that because we're aware of the damage it can cause, which wasn't as apparent back then, and Mildred herself demonstrates that. She found absolutely no problem with it. Without a loud victim and opposition - like with slavery how can people truly know?

>Some people. Not all. Or even most. And people were also aware of the immorality of child marriage.

Lol, the first idea of what a pedophile is was grasped by a few even in the 1950s, and today some states are still having to ban child marriage because it's legal. Slavery was arguably the most divisive issue in the history of this country, and that's undeniable. The vast majority of people were not aware of the immortality of child marriage. Again, you're using modern science and thinking to propel this argument, but it's just not working. People were religious, and being a virgin was considered more aligned with religion. I seriously don't understand how you can equate this to the most divisive issue in this country. Likely if a teen girl married, she just thought it was what God wanted, so silent victims don't talk, right? 

>We‚Äôre not dealing in your interpretations and wild speculations. We‚Äôre dealing with what I said. And I said nothing about Black men and their physical attractiveness because that‚Äôs immaterial to my argument.

It's a wild speculation to suggest if someone says you tend to get unattractive women who their men don't want they're implying you're not attractive....you can clarify your position but don't pretend it's inexplicable how someone gets that implication. 

>Which is a commentary on the white sexual economy and white women‚Äôs choices, not Black men‚Äôs.

No, it disproves this notion. White men can't even reject these alleged women they find unattractive if there's that level of desperation. 

>When considering all interracial relationships involving whites‚Äîthe dominant social class in terms of numbers and power‚ÄîBlack folks are the least likely to be the spouse. Even then, Black men are twice as likely to marry interracially as compared to Black women. This trend has only become more pervasive over time.

That's not proving what I said is incorrect. Most people marry within their race. Statistics can be misleading - if 3% of Black women are in an interracial marriage, and 6% of Black men are, Black men are 2x more likely to marry interracially, but it appears more sinister. 

>Most Americans are fine with gay marriage. That doesn‚Äôt mean most Americans want or have one.

That's different because that's regarding sexuality. I don't want to have a gay marriage because I'm not gay, but it should be legal. Those feelings aren't mutually exclusive. When referring to most Americans being ok with interracial marriage I'm demonstrating 9/10 people are not going to care, so I fail to understand this lack of social desirability you're referring to."

Off topic though, I found this really hilarious, when I was having a chat with one of my uncles/aunties that lived in the states (African) one of them told me the story of how they met a black man who had never left Fort Worth/Dallas county in his life. This man was 50 years old. That truly opened my eyes on how systematically oppressed some are. And the level of poverty we‚Äôre talking about. 

I remember they also told me, that when they told their black Americans friends that they had been to Houston (a city that is 4 hours away) they literally jumped up and down in disbelief ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been to Houston!

No and let me explain we all don't share the same Language and lingo even in Nigeria, and there isn't a slur directed at Black Americans in the Igbo Language, most of us call people including (black Americans and any black person that lived abroad) ""Foreigner"" or ""White person""  with one word, similar to how Spanish Speakers call foreigners and white people ""Gringo"".

"Black people generally don't use dating app, statistically speaking they are terrible unless they are designed for us.

Why is that?

Virtue signaling. Psychologically speaking people largely like to view themselves as objectively fair, egalitarian, progressive as we've coined those things to be in part of highly moral value structures.  It's easy to practice these in mundane and  overly regulated  spaces like business and government, in which we constantly default to agreed upon decorum, decorum based on the culture im the upward echelons of power. 

What's more complicated is to be objectively fair, egalitarian and progressive in the intimate places deeply integral to our being, like religion, from the level of denomination to the integration of our churches, our neighborhoods to our very homes, our communities to our intimate relationships. You'll find these ripe with bigotry and people hate for those bigotries to be questioned.

On an intimate level most people are following a deeply personal value system that they refuse to examine or explain. 


In other words, the psychosis that you see in other wise well presenting people expressing themselves on dating apps, will continue for a very long time. As most people are s***** individuals masquerading as paragons of the public's virtues. 

I find that in general African Americans (I'm from the South mind you) want a more socially connected culture than some majority groups, we actively seek each other out in real life, for that reason we don't need or rely on dating apps as much. I also don't see us having a widely accepting view on hookup culture."		reply	na	na	na	0.004680991172790527	no	strong	strong	na	blackmen

I think parts of American culture became  dogma with the wide spread growth of the internet, we just kind of accepted things to be true because we very quickly had to move on to the next phenomena.

"I am a 27 black male and I date exclusively black women. My friends say that I spend too much money early on in dating and that I shouldn't take women on actual dates in the beginning. Things typically have been falling through with women that I meet due to ""lack of a spark"". However, I escalate and flirt on dates, and even end most of them with kisses. However, nothing leads to sex. My friends say its because I am treating them too nicely and spending too much on dates, but I spend between $50-100 usually on dates which imo isn't much, but they say even that is too much. They tell me to take them to like Chilis or something cheap. However, at my age and especially dating young professionals I don't really think this would fly. Usually, I do a coffee date or drinks and a walk or an activity afterward if I am feeling up to it. It usually leaves a good enough impression that I get a second date and usually, things fall apart before or after the 3rd date.

">My friends say that I should just invite women to my place from the jump, but idk. Does this work for anyone? How do you guys approach dating?

Imo most women wouldn't be up for safety reasons, unless they don't care and they are just looking to hook up.

As for $50-100 being a lot, I would say it depends. Normally dates do come out to that much, but for a first date I wouldn't spend that much because it adds up and if I'm routinely going on dates with new women then I'm not gaining anything from that.

The first date with my fiance I asked to an art museum, they had this limited time treasures of ancient Africa exhibit that I wanted to go see. Normally the museum is free but special exhibits are $6 so I bought our tickets. After that we went to grab food at a place she suggested, and we both bought our own meals and talked. 

Overall it was a pretty good date, we enjoyed ourselves and I just came up out of $6 on her. Now when we go out I'm comfortable spending more since we're together."	BigBoiSouth	reply	na	na	na	0.008359611965715885	no	strong	strong	na	blackmen

I feel like you're doing too much personally. First date or first couple should be simple, like ice cream, drink, mini golf, hike, something along those lines. You are just feeling a person out. Once you are getting serious you can do more serious dates. But yeah it's ultimately important to do that since you don't want her to feel cheap. However, I am wondering what you are doing on these first dates? Just dinner? A movie? I'd focus less on what you're spending and focus more on introducing your date to an adventurous location or something they've never done before. Create unique experiences rather than expensive ones. Be more creative with what you are doing. If a girl wants to be with you she'll do cheap dates with you.	BigBoiSouth	reply	na	na	na	0.008359611965715885	weak	no	no	na	blackmen

outside of that, it depends on the girl.

is this a girl that you see possible dating/long term potential in? take her out to eat.

"50-100 is a lot for a first date. I think you doing a little to much. First date is more like 40 max. Then if you like her and feel a spark you could spend more on the 2nd and 3rd date.

Just do dinner at like a decent local spot or something light like putt putt golf, top golf (or one if its clones I don‚Äôt actually have a top golf in my area), a barcade, Dave and busters etc. for a first date.

Yo Bro, I feel you, Im your age and was making too much money (6 figures) the last 4 years, and I would throw money at all my problems. I would say worry less about what you spend and more about spending your time on people who deserve it, quality dates are better than quantity. Shit, the way you're spending you could buy Apple stocks, save for a downpayment, or donate it, either way. If you HAVE to take a woman on a date to feel like it could have potential, maybe it's not the right thing to do, if you WANT to go on a date with a person because you feel like they click with you, it shouldn't matter the price of the adventure they will be down.

i‚Äôve been in an exclusive relationship for over 5 years, but when i did date, i didn‚Äôt focus on price. where do you want to go? where do you feel comfortable with a first date? creating in an environment where the two of you are comfortable to chat and be open with each other is far more important than the price tag. if it‚Äôs a $20 coffee date or a $100 wine bar, as long as the two if you are comfortable where you are, the price isn‚Äôt really a factor as long as you can afford it. i find the people who focus on how much a date costs are focused on the wrong things. my wife and i had indian food and went to dave and busters for our first date. probably cost me somewhere around $100, but we had a great time. that‚Äôs what‚Äôs important.

Honestly you‚Äôre doing to much to create a romantic environment when that romantic attraction is still being built and is fragile. Instead you should treat early dates like hang outs: quick treat/desert while walking a park, hanging out at a bar or lounge together, taking a small drive and drinking slushes. Basically you don‚Äôt want to create an atmosphere of treating her so nice she goes on guard thinking she will owe sex or something. You‚Äôre doing everything wrong and no wonder you‚Äôve lost out every time. Stop this stupid mentality that women are prizes and not people. Treat her like a stranger you‚Äôre getting to know than your wife dude. You don‚Äôt spent 100s on strangers. Will you go give 50 - 100 to a homeless person? Then don‚Äôt do it for her until enough time and attraction has passed/been built that she will actually be grateful and appreciative of the date. This is where mass media has f* a lot of guys.

"bro don‚Äôt listen to this dude.  reddit is a place where you can find helpful information if you know where to look.

part of the reason why you aren‚Äôt getting play might be that you don‚Äôt know your ‚Äútype‚Äù. 

by that I don‚Äôt mean who you are attracted to, but who is most likely to be attracted to YOU.  

You‚Äôve gotta figure out your attraction profile so you can work on enhancing whatever traits you innately have that these women want from you over another dude.

You also might need to spend more time talking to them before you offer to take them out.  

There will be tells in the communication back and forth that will tell you whether or not they‚Äôre feeling you or they‚Äôre just bored and looking for some attention.  I call them ‚Äúindicators of interest‚Äù.

part of me feels like you‚Äôre bum rushing the situation a lil bit and shorties can catch that vibe from a mile away.  

It makes them feel not that they are interacting with a charismatic person, but with a dude that‚Äôs getting no play and is just going through the motions.  

8 dates over 2 months means that either you‚Äôre the smoothest mf in the world, or you‚Äôre picking these girls at random.

slow it down a bit to maybe 1-2 dates a month, and re-evaluate the contexts in which you are meeting these women, so you can look for indicators of interest. 

once you get enough of those, then evaluate the likelihood of a good first linkup and go from there.  

It‚Äôll be a lot of trial and error, but I feel like if you can do 8 dates in 8 weeks, you definitely have the stamina to develop a more measured approach.  

Also, lots of women love fluffy dudes bro.  you gotta embrace that shit. I want you to work on finding your target audience. once you figure that out, you‚Äôll feel a lot more confident.

"After reading several news articles, it was reported that even his own parents claimed they couldn't imagine him doing anything like this. They mentioned that he wasn't acting like himself before returning to the army, and apparently, he had recently experienced the loss of a very close cousin. Even his fellow military friends noticed there was something unusual about his behavior. He also has a history of being violent and  accused numerous assault when serving in South Korea. He was detained there until he was bailed for $4000.

Ok so here is my personal theory: The guys is in a nihilistic phase, where he feels like he has got nothing to lose, when your so depressed and beaten down by life, you don‚Äôt care about the consequences any more. This has nothing to do with race, this human psychology. This man might be going through something like that.

On a side note: it makes me disappointed that many people are so quick to come their own conclusion about him, that he‚Äôs stupid, drunk , inherently violent etc. It‚Äôs just pure ignorance. It low-key makes me sick. The world has ran out of any empathy or any willingness to understand someone perspective. Can you believe what the top comments were on the popular videos documenting on his situation. ‚ÄúGood for him, he will learn a good lesson‚Äù ‚ÄúOh he‚Äôs young an dumb, probably a TikTok stunt‚Äù ‚Äúlol, I don‚Äôt care what happens to him‚Äù. Each of these type of comments have over a 1000 likes and are by far the most popular opinions. I couldn‚Äôt believe how heartless and close minded people could be. 

Please people, learn to be broad-minded and learn to be empathetic.


It‚Äôs clear it was some sort of nihilistic mental breakdown that could have caused this. We have no idea what what was running through his psyche before he did that.

No one here was actually there at those offending events. There's some speculation around reddit; that some of the South Korean bars discriminate against foreigners (more so dark colored ones) which could have prompted an outburst from King. Someone else was referencing kicking the cop car and mentioned maybe King had some previous bad, racialized encounters with the police (RIP travis jordan) and too much to drink.

"I was having a heart-to-heart conversation with a Black woman that I'm close with lately. She explained to me how she grew up feeling frustrated as hell that she couldn't get attention from Black men. That she felt overlooked by them because she didn't have the curvaceous body that Black men or any men attracted to Black women would want. But, her frustration existed primarily in wanting to feel wanted by a Black man or even Black men in general. She said that she eventually just opened up her market to anyone that wanted her and has been talking to men from different races lately because she said she just wants to be happy.

I related with her because I went through something similar. But, my situation was that I was raised by parents that were traumatized by their community sheltered me away from it as much as possible. Even going as far as homeschooling me and keeping me in my home for weeks. The end result is me, having been raised by the internet and autistic, I was super socially inept.

As a result, I couldn't get along with anyone. But, I think being unable to get along with other Black people stung the most because I expected them to be more open to me. Since women, to this day, make me nervous, you can imagine how bad I was with girls back then. I chalked it up to being a ""square"" instead of being hood or some dumb shit. But, in reality, I just didn't know how to talk to people. I wanted Black friends but I definitely wanted attention from Black women and I never really got it. For most of my life, I only had eyes for Black women. But, rarely it worked out. It's like as soon as I opened my mouth, they tuned out. Made me feel like something was wrong with me, you know? I still want Black women and their attention but I've since opened up to seeing anyone that wants me.

It was the first time I really opened up about it in a space where I felt like I could without being judged. I never opened up about it because I never wanted to feel like those Black people on the internet that throw Black women or Black men under the bus and blamed them for their experiences and laced it with racism. Seeing Black women on the internet say racist shit about black dudes as their justification for leaving them alone hurts to the least. Seeing Black dudes on the internet grandstand about dating out because Black women are trashy or whatever is embarrassing. I never wanted to return that energy because I genuinely don't feel that way and I didn't want to hurt anyone the way that content hurt me.

It was the first time I heard someone explain their feelings about something like that in a nuanced way without blaming black men or saying that they're wrong for not giving her attention. Same way that I don't blame black women for not giving me attention.

She just wanted to fit in. Likewise, I just wanted to fit in. It didn't work out for us. I want to believe that a lot of the weird hateful gender-war shit I used read online was born from experiences similar to ours and not literal racism. I was reminded that social media exaggerates everything to its literal extreme when life isn't nearly as black and white. But, stepping away from the internet allowed me to have experiences like this to begin with. At my lowest point, I let seeing Black women with white men make me feel like less or a man and that I had personal responsibility in the reason for BW dating out. Social media destroyed my brain. I've been picking up the pieces since.

Just wanted to share a milestone. Been documenting some of my mental health journey here and there in case anyone wants to read and hopefully takes something positive from it.

My take on it has recently become: go where you want *and* are wanted. That may be among black folks, it may not be. You have deep-seated reasons for feeling good wherever you do because the world, if you ain't white, can be traumatic.

"As I move deeper into my early 30s, I'm starting to feel a certain emotional distancing from my parents. I have an estranged brother around my age with a young daughter that is involved with our side of the family.

"I got married last year. We're both in our 30s. My wife is older than me and over the cutoff for what is medically considered geriatric pregnancy. She's not too old to have a child safely but just based on how old she is it would be something that the doctors would approach with caution. I am not really sold on kids one way or the other. I think I could handle being a dad but I also don't feel the need to become one. My wife has a pretty large amount of student debt to pay off and she doesn't work in a field that is high paying so I have to help out with that. My mom has some rental properties and she pretty much needs constant help financially. I'm the most successful of her kids so I usually am the first one to get a call when she needs money. Half of what I made last month went to paying for stuff like that. Which doesn't cover utility bills and some food (my wife covers most of the groceries). I don't want to even be thinking about kids until we are in a more stable position. Like some savings, emergency fund, and a house that we own as opposed to rent. That is going to be pretty impossible when people keep needing me to throw money at other things. My wife and my family all thought I would cave on this after the wedding and just have a kid anyway. My parents raised us to not make kids we couldn't afford though. So it backfired a little bit. My mom and my wife are really the ones riding the baby train but I just can't make it work and also keep throwing money at these other issues. I've had to point blank say ""This is what needs to happen before I cosign having a kid. If we miss the window for \[my wife\] safely having a baby because we couldn't hit these marks then we unfortunately will miss that window. It will be disappointing but not as disappointing as trying to raise a kid with no long term stability."" I'm not in a boat by myself though. Both sides of my family have a mix bag of responsible kids and irresponsible kids. All the irresponsible ones had like 3+ kids by their 30s and all the responsible ones have been childless.

I'm now married. My family thought marriage would change my stance on not wanting kids. **It hasn't.**

My wife is 36 next week, she doesn't want kids either.

When we first started dating our families constantly told us that we'll change our minds. We were told we were selfish for not wanting to have kids. We were told how we make such good money and could live the same lifestyle with kids, etc.

We openly discussed the subject with family. Eventually we had to set boundaries around the conversations we were willing to have though. We made it clear we weren't open to being harassed about it.

We decided that kids don't fit the life we live, which made a lot of our family uncomfortable - for a while.

As we get older our family sees how not having kids has benefited us. Many of them now respect & affirm our decision. 

OP what do you think about opening up the conversation with your parents? Ask how they feel about it? Maybe tell them some of your fears or what youre feeling around the subject,?

They might not have any idea of your expectations of them. I've learned that those around you have no way of knowing what is happening in our heads & what we're feeling if you don't tell them.

"That's in no way exclusive to Reddit or Social Media. In fact, the people who just handwave things as ""It's just social media"" really make me question the critical thinking skills of the average person. 

Social media is just a sheet of paper everyone can write on. Real people post what they really feel or think, often more truthfully than they would in real life thanks to anonymity. 

At home, most people live in a bubble. They don't have to deal with a lot of the major issues that plague society personally. This leads them to conclude those issues aren't real or are minor, but that is just confirmation bias.

"Recently I had my high school graduation party, and it made me think about my identity. A lot of my aunties and uncles from across the world came to my Nigerian grad party. My parents were first generation immigrants who forced me to do good in school. Usually African families have a very strong family structure because they're still connected to their African roots. My family structure allowed me to have a good relationship with both of my parents, and made it easy to talk to other family members. I still have an African last name, and I am surrounded by people who have worked hard in school. My parents believe that ""It takes a whole village to raise a child"". Because of this, I was able to travel internationally, and I got accepted into a good college.

From what I've heard and seen, African Americans don't have a strong connection to their African roots because of the slave trade. My friend told me that African American families have weak family structures because the fathers are out of the household. This makes it hard for them to do well in school. Add that to the generational trauma and systematic racism that they've experienced, and you have an extremely weak family structure. This makes it extremely tough for them to connect with their African roots, and trace back their identity.

I also have a feeling that African immigrants work extremely hard in America because they have a clear vision of the American dream. When my dad came from Nigeria, he already knew that he had to work his ass off to finish college. If he didn't do well, then he would've disappointed his parents. My mom had the same mindset as my dad. Both of my parents were extremely grateful that they were able to come to America instead of staying in their native country. I feel like that motivated them to finish school, and start a family. Most African Americans have a different mindset when it comes to these things.

Obviously there are exceptions to the rule, but I'm just speaking for the average African immigrant family versus the average African American family. I apologize if I'm generalizing too much. Family structure and cultural roots are extremely when it comes to success in the black community.

What are your thoughts on this topic? Any personal experiences?"	Buddymaster39449	post	31.40064306041824	female	White	0.0026559808757156134	na	na	na	30	blackmen
"I think it depends on the perspective. You can say ‚ÄúAfrican Americans have weak family structures because their fathers are out of the household‚Äù or you can say ‚ÄúAfrican Americans have had their families systematically torn apart of centuries because they were basically cattle for generations and it‚Äôs impressive at how the women have been able to hold down the fort and produce leaders that have made changes. 

You can say that Nigerians are chasing an American dream because they are grateful for the opportunity. But you can also say Nigerians are coming to benefit off the rights that African Americans have been fighting for for years. Because if the African Americans hadn‚Äôt fought for black rights then idk how much African immigrants would be able to succeed now. 

I think there are a lot of different narratives being told from different perspectives and of course your background influences the narrative you agree with most. 

Also I don‚Äôt understand the comment about African family structures and roots and having an African last name. Also it‚Äôs really odd to compare the status of people who have no history in America to those who have built America. That‚Äôs like comparing the status of African Americans who move to Ghana and then open businesses. That would be the equivalent of them saying ‚Äúidk why people here don‚Äôt do xyz‚Äù. Strange. 

With that being said, you‚Äôre aware already that our family names have been taken from us. Our culture developed in a place that tried to assimilate us, dehumanize us and strip us of our identity. And it wasn‚Äôt until the 90‚Äôs where we couldn‚Äôt be discriminated against for housing. And we‚Äôre still living in a period where our people are suffering. Our suffering has never stopped because a lot has intentionally been done to make us suffer. 

You guys might be coming here with just the clothes on your back, but you‚Äôre not carrying the same relationship we have with the country. I don‚Äôt think comparisons help anything. But appreciation helps. 

I appreciate how African Americans have come so far in such a short amount of time even though they have not healed as a community and the country tries to hide a lot of its colonial history in an attempt to gas light us into thinking things are okay.

Slavery, Jim Crow, systemic racism and discrimination from the start fucked us when it came to creating a stable rich culture. Any time we got a leg up, parts of the system we live in figured out a way to shut it down.

"Nobody is calling a ""timeout"", if you are not a Black American who is a descendant of U.S chattel slavery, then what goes on in our community is none of your concern especially if you want to talk the ""problems"" in our community, but you aren't trying to fix them yourself. Also, Black Americans can compare ourselves to alot of people in their home countries that are in certain situations, but I'm sure that wouldn't be fair, right? People migrate to America willingly, then try to compare themselves to us when they don't have a big demographic here to begin with.

"I'm an 18 year old black man who needs relationship advice. I don't have that much experience  because I've only been in one relationship. But when I do get into another relationship, should I keep it low-key or should I tell other people about it? If I do tell other people, should I only tell my parents?

"My opinion is this, it's better to keep relationships private and maybe disclose it to people you can trust that don't have a big mouth because it shouldn't be everyone's business to know that. 

As for guy friends, this is a more nuanced topic to be honest. I would tell you to make a list, write down a list of boundaries that you have in a relationship that are not willing to tolerate and that you'd leave a relationship for. Try to be reasonable, but don't be too naive either. Make sure it makes sense and can be explained. I personally would say that it's best to date a girl that doesn't have guy friends generally speakinf, and definitely not ones that are not over their ex's as well (you'll see the signs). Anyway, once you have this list, make sure to discuss it with the girl you wanna be serious with.

What do you do if she breaks your boundaries or disregards them? Don't get frustrated and angry at her, why? Because you don't need to waste your energy and happiness on someone that doesn't respect you. You warn her calmly that you take these boundaries seriously. If she does it again then you just break it off, don't ever be afraid to leave because fear of leaving is what usually seems to cause things to escalate further. Just remember, if she respects you she will also respect the boundaries you set or at least debate on them prior to breaking them. Your gf will probably have her own set of boundaries too, don't break them either, it's better if it's mutual."	Buddymaster39449	reply	na	na	na	0.0189293771982193	no	no	no	na	blackmen
"I'm the same way about my business. But if I do tell someone, it's someone I know I can trust. But even before I do, I like to wait a bit and get to know her before I tell people I trust. Just know that you're not obligated to tell anyone anything.  Also, you'll learn women will do whatever they want regardless of how you feel about it. So like others said, if she cares about you, she'll focus on you and respect you by limiting her talks with other guy friends. 

My ex hated when I talked randomly to other women because she was heavily insecure and it was suffocating because she brought her old trust issues over to me. Don't let your trust issues be the thing that messes up your future relationships. Build up your confidence in yourself so that if she does talk to other guys behind your back, you understand that the problem wasn't you and you can move on with confidence.  All the best."

Why would you recieve more attention because you have a GF? The world doesn't revolve around you. Tell people about her? Is she is a test score, or a diagnosis, etc..

With each passing year it becomes more apparent to me how crucial it is to make a distinction between community and individual. There is no shortage of Asian individuals who are doing the work to be allies and they deserve respect & acknowledgement for it, but the Asian American community on the aggregate has definitely been a bit of a‚Ä¶ liability for a while now. My personal view is that Black people‚Äôs solution is to start making our allyship conditional. Instead of inviting any & everyone to the cookout just for faking a blaccent and knowing the lyrics to 1 R&B song, we need to reserve the plates for those who demonstrate the will to meaningfully look out for us.

A couple tips

Get comfortable with networking and putting yourself out there because that opens you up to opportunities later on. 

Never stop learning and always stay on the path of developing your skills and learning new technologies.

Learn how to invest LONG TERM. To do this Go on Tradingview.com and get an indicator called 3ema. 
This gives you 3 moving averages. Calculate how many days are in 1 year, 5 years and 10 years and plug those numbers in on the day chart. Look for ETFs to purchase by SECTORS(ie clean energy, cybersecurity, Electric vehicles).

"I grew up poor and now I‚Äôm fairly financially independent (making ~$400k at Google, own a home, car, and on a path to leave a few million to each child when I die). Here‚Äôs my recommendations: 

(1) Be obsessed with having mastery of your craft. Set aside a few hours each week to study. Always study, even after you graduate, alway study and practice your craft. At work, always go hard. Push yourself to perform at the top of your field. Having mastery of your craft will give you more options for navigating around racism. I faced a lot of racism in my career but being very good at what I do also meant that i found a lot people that didn‚Äôt look like me that were willing to advocate for me.

(2) Find mentors and sponsors. If your school or job has a black student or employee group, join it and ask advice from black people that are doing what you want to do. Ask them for advice on finding mentors and sponsors. You need to find someone that you can trust to help guide you through efficient career progression. Not doing this myself early on is one of my biggest regrets. When you become more financially comfortable, get a career coach.

(3) Build your network: go to meet ups, go to work events, get drinks with your coworkers, etc. Build relationships with people in your field and people adjacent to your field (Product Managers, Data Scientists, etc). Have occasional meetings where ere you are just getting to know your coworkers vs talking business. Good relationships will open more doors than merely being good at what you do. Also build up your personal network. If you are religious, attend a men‚Äôs group. You must have 2-3 people in your personal life that care about you, will emotionally support you, and give you candid advice. So invest in close friendships. It is impossible to be really successful alone. You need a lot of emotional and spiritual support from friends and professional support and advice from colleagues.

(4) Know your industry. Identity influential voices  in your industry. Know what blogs they are reading, what conferences they are attending, and understand what the top priorities of your industry are. 

(5) build your brand. Identify the skills, passions, and values that you want people to associate with you then start producing content about those. For example, if you are obsessed with low latency networks, build your competency and familiarity in that area and start writing about it on LinkedIn (making sure you get feedback from a peer before publishing).

(6) Go to therapy: the BS you face as a black man can often cause you to develop survival instincts that hold you back in the professional world. For example, I always avoided speaking up unless I knew I was 100% correct. So white and Asian guys that knew half of what I knew were able to position themselves as thought leaders while i struggled to gain recognition. Working with a therapist help me surface and better manage the fear of experiencing blowback because im black. 

(7) work hard but also rest well. Take time to exercise, take time to process your feelings, be with friends, rest your mind and body, and take time to do the things that leave you excited to take on the challenges of life (for me this is reading books from thought leaders). A lack of physical, mental, or emotional health could easily undermine everything you‚Äôve built for yourself, so make sure you protect your health. I practice this by adopting a sabbath.

(8) Find ways to live a fulfilling life below your means. If you can live in that cheaper apartment without putting a heavy tax on your mental health or sense of safety, do it. If you can replace going to the bar with having drinks in your apartment with friends, then do it. Always consider if there is a much cheaper way to have the same about of fun.

"I'm 31, been in IT for 6 years now close to 7. The road started out difficult. I went to college in 2009 for computer science then dropped out in 2011 cause I couldn't afford it. I joined the air force reserve later that year and did an aircraft maintenence job (part time), and worked a warehouse full time. Used the GI and went back to college in 2014 but switched majors to CIS and finished in 2016. Then after that I switched over to a cyber job in the air national guard. That's what basically started my career in IT. It was a bit rough at first cause my first real job was stressful and not enough pay imo but as I moved it it got way easier. 

Some advice I have is to not worry about being a job hopper as long as the moves aren't lateral. Loyalty from a company is dead these days and if there's a better opportunity out there then always go for it. I've had 4 jobs since 2018, moving from 62k to what I make now because of that. Also find a good balance in your late teens and 20s where you enjoy these years as you won't get them back, but at the same time having something to show for them once you get out. Your older self will thank your younger self for the work you put in. One more piece of advice is to invest early. Start a Roth IRA if you haven't and put in what you can.

"Most of the Black women I know aren't dating street dudes or dope boys, and if they did at one point, they don't want them anymore. I'm in my late 20's and living in LA, and I've found that having a fresh cut, groomed beard, confidence, goals that you're actively working towards, social skills, and basic fashion sense goes way further than being a ""thug.""

Women want someone with swag. This isn't particular to Black women; it's true for every race and ethnicity.

Everyone's cool/swag doesn't have to look the same. Tyler the Creator's swag isn't the same as Steve Lacey's, and Steve Lacey's isn't the same as Asap Rocky's.

This question makes me laugh because I think ppl in general are attracted to people who they are in proximity with, grew up with, of the culture idolizes. SO MANY black ppl are from the hood, women included, so I feel like‚Ä¶ there will always be a high number of ppl attracted to hood shit. Life 18% of blk ppl live at or below the poverty line. They likely live in the hood. Then you gotta account for the 27% percent of black ppl that‚Äôs lower middle class. That right there is almost half likely living in the hood. The likely hood of ppl from the hood liking hood shit is pretty high. Then the culture says that certain behavior is more masculine than the other and some women are attracted masculinity cause they like to feel protected and live in their feminity.

If you get tattoos, sag your pants a little, groom yourself well or have long hair specifically locs.  Black women will go out their way to approach you.

"I'm just over 40. I've never seen this be overwhelmingly true at any point in my life. It can be applicable but I don't think it's necessarily that women want ""the thug"". It's really a level of excitement that they are looking for.

Per your sister: Thug and hood dude aren't necessarily the same thing. You can be from the hood and not check any of the thug boxes and at the same time be a thug from the burbs.

Whenever a woman rejects a dude for whatever reason I encourage folks to not take it personally and not as an indictment of all women viewing him that way.

"I‚Äôve seen way too many sisters who attracted to thugs and have tried to raise my daughter to not fall into that trap. One way I‚Äôve done this is by telling her the following story. 

When I was in college I shared an apartment with a brother who had gone to Hampton and was now at my school in a Masters/PhD program. One Saturday morning he got a call from a former classmate from Hampton telling him that a classmate of theirs had been murdered.

From what my roommate told me, the sister had come from a Huxtable-type family. One parent was a doctor and the other parent was a lawyer. All through college she likes hanging out in clubs with thugs‚Ä¶drinking their liquor, driving their cars, and who knows what else. Even after she graduated college, had earned her Masters degree, and had a good job, she still liked hanging out with thugs.

On the night in question, she was driving the car of some thug who had done someone dirty. As she was stopped at a red light, a car pulled up along side her and opened fire. She was killed on the spot.

This sister found nice guys, like her father, too boring. She liked to dabble in that fast life and, unfortunately, found out that that fast life comes with consequences. 

My daughter has heard this story quite a few times and, so far, its lesson seems to have sunk into her brain."	hugme-imscared	reply	na	na	na	0.9962661862373352	no	strong	no	na	blackmen

I think a lot of times when we have these discussions, people tend to just look at the hood nigga vs black nerd, they don‚Äôt ever consider the guy in the middle, the Will Smiths, the Lawrence off Insecure, the Michael B Jordans of the world. 

All of those guys have charisma, it‚Äôs just that black women like a certain type of appearance. I think the appearance of the man is more important than anything else. I‚Äôve seen hood niggas with tats and fronts literally just get approached by black women all because of their ‚Äúhood appearance‚Äù and had absolutely zero to do with any charisma.

I wouldn't recommend trying them at home though. They are very dangerous and can be a catalyst for schizophrenia and other severe disorders if not handled properly. 

From what I've read about during monitored trials, they are very effective. It seems as though they can reset the operating system of our brains. So where now your brain is operating in a state of PTSD and hyper alertness, psychedelic treatment could possibly reset the processes in your brain that are causing that.

I recently moved to the south to a city with a high black population and proximity to HBCUs, and went from feeling like I was scraping the barrel in terms of quality, to talking to multiple high quality, beautiful black women that are taking me seriously ( one was a NFL cheerleader). Almost overnight, let me tell you I don‚Äôt believe in coincidence either.

"I'll start by saying its dope that you came here to ask for feedback. Kudos to you.

I'll give some general feedback, hopefully its helpful. As with everything, take whats for you and toss the rest. I'm speaking as a married, 38 year old male.

Lets start with the inner you before addressing the outer you.

Health is wealth. All forms of health - physical, mental, emotional. Set goals for each, get clear on them, and pursue them.

PHYSICAL HEALTH

First, go see your doctor. As black men its critical at all ages, not just when youre older.

Another comment mentioned eating, and I agree, diet & eating habits are critical. Protein is important, but beyond that, specifically look into calculating your macronutrients and center your diet towards a fitness goal.

You looking to bulk up?  Get lean? Do you have a goal weight? Start with a goal, then research what you need to execute it.

EMOTIONAL | MENTAL HEALTH

Even if you're healthy emotionally, look into therapy. I'm at the gym daily, and just like I work out physically, therapy is exercise/fitness for my mind and emotions. It helps me figure my own shit out so I don't project it onto others.

Therapy helped me level up in all areas of my life. I'd never make my current salary without the level of self awareness therapy helped create. I learned to reflect on my actions, learn from them and move more intentionally through the world. Now I'm constantly becoming a better version of myself.

Emotional intelligence, if you have it salute to you. If not, work to develop it. It's important for developing substantative relationships of all kinds.

I'm almost 38 and just truly grasping emotional intelligence. Growing up I was taught to surpress my emotions. I used to confuse ""controlling"" my emotions with emotional intelligence. I'm learning experiencing & being in relationship with your emotions is the true intelligence. 

A couple other general tips to help mentally & emotionally:
Keep learning.
Approach the world with curiosity.
Find more things that genuinely interest you.
Try incorporating new experiences. New experiences will always keep you interesting as a person.

The shit that actually matters at the end of the day is who you are. But with that said, it helps to present your self well.

When you approach your wardrobe, here's some things it might help to think through:

- Whats in your budget? What do you wear?
Dress for your body, not your budget. Not all good clothes have to cost. And not all expensive clothes look good if they fit terribly.

Approach wardrobe by considering your current body type. My weight constantly changes & being aware helps to know what to wear & when.

How do your clothes fit? What do you want to highlight? What do you want to hide? I prefer shirts that show off my arms & hide my belly.

If dressing & fashion isn't intuitive for you right now, just remember less is more. Simplicity is art when done right.

- What is your personal style?
If you could dress however you wanted regardless of budget, what would that version of you look like?

 Then do your best to get to that version of you. Shop for similar looks in your budget.

Keep growing & getting better, everything else will fall in line. Hopefully something here helps."	Bluex619	reply	na	na	na	0.0016750689828768373	weak	no	no	na	blackmen

"Are you actually open for advice or are you going to fight back every suggestion? 

Well here are some suggestions in case you‚Äôre open minded.

- Lose body weight and get around 15% BF
- Get your teeth whitened 
- Get a signature fragrance that matches your style 
- Develop hobbies (preferably ones where you meet other people)
- I think you should lose the dreads but your free to do what you want
- Get some nice and discreet jewelry that is water resistant and matches your style (also make sure that if you do so, to get matching jewelry sets eg all silver or all gold 
- Pay an expert to help you flesh out your tinder profile and pictures (you can get it done under 50$ and it‚Äôs worth getting an objective view from someone who has seen a lot of successful/unsuccessful dating profiles 
- Learn a martial art 
- Learn a new language 
- Ask friends to take pictures of you candidly or when your doing social things 
- Get all your pants tailored to your body and height 

These are all doable and should not break your bank. They can also help you tremendously in your dating life. As with everything in life, pick the meat and spit out the bones."	Bluex619	reply	na	na	na	0.0016750689828768373	no	no	strong	na	blackmen

"This clown is about 45% right. Keep your hair. You keep it clean, and it‚Äôs working for you. Also, if you like it, you should keep it. There‚Äôs someone for everybody, and if someone is going to turn you down because of your interests (hair style) they are not for you. 

Go to the gym, but only exercise in the ways that give you pleasure and results. The best workout is the one you‚Äôre going to do consistently.

If glasses are your thing, make them a part of your fashion. They don‚Äôt have to be utilitarian.

"Bro dont listen to this man.. keep the dreads. They fit you and cutting them isnt going to do anything for you except maybe attract some women that let themselves be turned off by longer hair? Are those the women youre tryna attract? Youre already winning by getting matches (alot of dudes get no matches at all)

All you have to do capitalize on those matches. So in addition to getting your body right you also gotta develop a ‚Äúdynamic‚Äù personality if dont already have one. Its kinda hard to explain this one but its really just standing out. For example you cant be one of the 1000x dudes that rely on liking anime and being ‚Äúnonchalant‚Äù as your thing. So many dudes are going for that‚Ä¶ Not saying thats you but thats how alot of modern dudes are these days.

Please dont make any drastic changes outside of getting your body right and upgrading your style a bit. I cannot stress this enough, do not lose yourself trying to attract girls who don‚Äôt currently appreciate you. Focus on the girls you‚Äôre currently attracting because those are the ones that really appreciate you and theyll only appreciate you more once you get your body and style together

There are more black women (and men) in the cities, of which London is by far the biggest, and people are generally more used to seeing different kinds of black people, so you won't be looked at as ""exotic"".

"Ja Morant is a great basketball player with a ton of potential, but he needs to make better choices. I thought it was corny when Ja was talking about being from the trenches after he lost in the playoffs last season(2022). At first, I didn't think much of it, but then Ja started beefing with the Warriors and said he could beat MJ in a 1v1 and I started to question him a little bit. As soon as I heard the story of him punching a teenager, and his friends pointing guns at security guards, I started losing respect for Ja. 

When I saw him flashing a gun in the strip club, I was disappointed in him. I saw his interview with Jalen Rose, and I assumed that he would never do it again, but that was not the case. When I saw the video of him flashing a gun in the car, I already knew that he fucked. 2 weeks ago my uncle came to my house, and everyone agreed that Ja Morant was making bad choices.

Why are all the black people taking some weird ass responsibility for his actions as if he represents us all? It‚Äôs so many other black guys that go unnoticed because they have zero drama. 

It is fair not right to judge him. He‚Äôs a gun owner like 90% of Americans. He got a corny Ass wanna be gangsta image etc

"I've got a dating question that's been on my mind, and I'm hoping to gain some valuable insights from your experiences. 

Lately, I've noticed a growing trend among guys, especially in the dating scene, where they confidently invite women over to their place right from the start on the first date. It got me wondering: does this approach require a unique level of mental strength, or is it simply that women are more open to it than I originally thought?

Speaking for myself, I've always approached dating with caution, never really considering the idea of bringing someone home on that initial encounter. I always assumed most women would NEVER go straight to a guy‚Äôs place on the first date and that the majority of men just ask for dates‚Ä¶.But as I've conversed with different people, including my current partner (which is what sparked this), it seems like there are plenty of regular guys who successfully take this approach.

So, do you believe that this kind of approach requires a certain level of mental strength? Are there specific qualities or traits that make these individuals more inclined to invite someone over early on? Or is it more about women being generally open to the idea? Have you encountered or tried this approach yourself, and if so, what has been the outcome?

I'm genuinely seeking your insights and any advice you might have. Help me understand if there's a correlation between mental strength and taking this dating approach, or if it's more about shifting perspectives and evolving dynamics. My girlfriend shared her online dating journey and shared that occasionally that guys  would invite her over on the first date and she would go (sometimes)! She even asked me why I didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm light weight wondering are these just really attractive guys, very bold men, or maybe I was just limiting myself."		post	40.06069722629152	male	White	0.003096373053267598	na	na	na	13	blackmen

What I've noticed is the type of women that is  eager to go over a guys place for a first date tend to want something more casual, so they don't care of the formalities. This rings true for women on apps just wanting a quick hookup. The ones who are looking to date more seriously will vet a man for a public date or two at least before getting comfortable enough to go to his crib. So it depends on the type of relationship that that man wants, and he goes for that type of woman accordingly.

I worked as a mental health counselor at the time so I had to constantly give people tips and advice on how to navigate this deadly pandemic that I didn‚Äôt have much knowledge on.

"I  heard this on a podcast and can't get it out of my head. I started  observing what men (outside of family, established friends, coworkers)  actually talk to me, and the phrase is turning out to be true.

I've  recently moved back to my home town after ten years abroad: my girl  friends have been all but thrilled to reconnect and hang out. My guys  friends: crickets except from the dudes who are clearly attracted to me,  and they see the hang out as a date and not a ""catch up with a friend  who's been gone for 10. Who I considered my closest guy friend has been  super distant and when I called him on it he said ""I can't talk or hang,  I have a girlfriend."" I'm like wait, do you think I have feelings  towards you? Why would we not be able to reconnect if not for some  latent attraction?

I've noticed  with stranger men IRL, at the gym and online: we can have a short  exchange, and guaranteed each time they'll follow up with a comment  expressing attraction during what I thought was a normal cordial  freaking human interaction.

To me it's kind of sad that most men invisibilize anything they don't find attraction, must be a lonely way to live.

"The honest opinion is that most men in your life that are not your family are willing to fuck you. That is too say any man being more than simply courteous is on a balance of probabilities attracted to you. Not all of your men, but most of your men. 

The older those men get the more they learn that ""be a friend"" doesn't actually work for getting laid and at best is dishonest. That's why those guys are giving you the cold shoulder... Or more harshly... It's been 10 years and they no longer find you attractive."	Sufficient-Impress-9	reply	na	na	na	0.0065604317933321	no	no	no	na	blackmen
"It's one of the dumbest phrases I've ever heard and ironically it will be repeated/enforced by those who say that men need to break away from toxic mindsets. People need to stop assuming every stranger who expresses some sort of interest in them is attracted to them because just like the joke of ""she's not into you she's just really kind to everyone"" there are a bunch of men who that quote applies to as well.

I'd be careful from getting advice from podcasts because they tend to have a very black and white view of the world. The podcaster notices something or even outright lies, and decides it has to be an absolute. They don't account for the fact that these individual men have different factors influencing their reason to speak to you.

"I'm going to push back on some of this. It's possible (if not probable) that some of your male friends 10 years ago would have only been friends because they were waiting for an opening to pursue something more than a platonic relationship. But I hate the generalizations that men only interact with women because we are trying to sleep with them. I have plenty of female friends. I don't find them all to be attractive physically nor would I like to have a relationship with all of them even if I was single. Maintaining relationships is hard though as time progresses. 10 years ago I was in my 20s, single, and had way less stuff to manage and way fewer goals than I do currently. I could more easily drop things to hang out with people. Now I try to take stock on what's up. If I haven't talked to someone in a decade or we've only spoken sparingly I would have to consider how much effort I can put into catching up with them, regardless of gender.

The other reason I push back on this idea is because men aren't the only people who pull back when they can't get what they want out of a relationship with someone. I've had female friends drop off the face of the earth when I made it clear that I wasn't interested in a relationship with them (specifically that I wasn't willing to cheat with them despite them showing no interest before I got in a relationship). I've had female friends who had no problems calling me with their problems or asking me to do things but were nowhere to be found when I could have used a friend. They pulled back when I stopped putting what they wanted me to do at a higher priority than what I needed to do for myself. What I'm getting at is that trash friends come in all genders. Saying ""If a man is talking to you it's because he's attracted to you"" is on par with someone saying that if a woman is talking to you it's because she wants your money.

I kind of understand where he's coming from. He could be dating an easily jealous woman, and going out alone with a female ""close friend"" may look suspect and he'd rather avoid the whole situation altogether. Sucks but it is what it is.

As for the rest of the post, from what I've experienced most men generally don't approach or express interest in talking to women in a purely plutonic manner, unless its a setting where you'd have a lot of mutual interactions like work. A lot of guys can't be friends with women they find attractive, because it leads to them wanting to be with her, which then leads to them placing themselves in the friendzone. I have some female friends, one of whom I'm close with and talk to at least weekly, but I'm not romantically interested in them so the friendship works out.

Most women don't make good friends not in the unique way men bond with each other.  Between the sexes it's rare for purely platonic to exist without there being a large benefit present.  In other words, men peep that most women just want men in their life for some tangible benefit, and not just to sit around, watch movies and play video games as they talk about life. Much like I am sure the friendships that men have with women don't offer women anywhere near the same benefit on social emotional level as friendships between women.

"There is definitely a fine line for sure. But a vast majority of the time when a man makes advances and gets offered ""friendship"" in return it's almost always one sided. You might not realize it at first but instead try viewing the dynamic from the other perspective.

Time and time again, Black males have accepted their race caste and all the stereotypes that embody them. We allow race ideology to beat us over the head too often. Remember the following:

- Black males are the most uneducated demographic in America. We have been for quite some time.

- Black males engage in violent crime at higher rates than most other demographics

- Black males make up a *huge* bulk of prison inmates.

- Black males are the least married group of men

- Gangsterism runs rampant in Black-dominated areas

- Black men‚Äîonce in the upper-middle class‚Äî are the most likely to fall down a tax bracket

Perhaps the bigger and better question is, why do Black males (and the parents that raise them) stereotype themselves? Being a Black man myself, I have never seen someone place so many limits on what a Black man can be like other Black males and the adults around them.

Why are Black males always stereotyped as being into sports over academics? I don't know, maybe because Black parents do a piss-poor job at getting Black boys to value academics. Maybe they (along with racist media) have convinced young Black males that the only authentic expression of Black expertise is in the field of manual labor (like sports or working at a factory).

Why are Black males always stereotyped as misbehaving? I don't know, maybe because there are statistics, cultural elements, and whatnot that do a good job at painting the image of young Black males generally being more misbehaving than other males. When I was younger, I went to numerous middle and high schools that contained Black kids. And they (the boys, really) always seemed to have a misbehaving element about them that was either nonexistent in other groups or far less prevalent.

Before asking why other people think the way they do about us,we have to start critiquing our own manhood first as a collective.

It is not immoral to not want children. You'll have to get used to this ideological position given that the population of first-world countries stagnate.

>Imagine if your parents said the same thing

What, you mean before I was born? I wouldn't care as I wouldn't be alive to care. Saying it while I am alive is different as they would have to take my feelings into consideration. Chances are that some people's dad didn't want them *before* they were born.

Um...I am confused. Was this actually said, or are you pushing through with a straw man argument? Because I don't believe I actually said it was ""only"" Black boys.

>You even say that they had a ""misbehaving element"" about them. Like cmon now. So every other group was on their best behavior every day?

So are you telling me that you didn't catch the part where I stated‚Äîand I paraphrase‚Äîthat ""the misbehaving element was either nonexistent or not as prevalent as it was in other groups"". The last nine words are very important.

>There are stats on white men being school shooters and child abusers but no one generalizes them all as that tho

This is a very misleading take. While most school shooters are white men, most white men are not school shooters. I guarantee you that Black men shoot up their neighborhoods more times than white men shoot up schools, and that Black men kill other Black men via gun violence and gangsterism antics at rates higher than white men PER CAPITA. Do you agree?

Furthermore, white men have so much representation outside of those criminal caricatures that it is difficult for the masses to put them in a box of criminality. White men simply do not allow themselves to be pressured by such nonsense, but young Black males have been falling for this since the 70s and before. This is non-negotiable; it is a fact that we have a history of violent criminality that largely goes unchecked by other Black men.

>I hate being black sometimes. Im never an individual

You know what? You are going to get mostly shit for saying that, but it is actually *very* normal for a lot of Black males to think that way. I am not saying that it is the right or wrong way to think, only that I understand. 

Black men (and others) like to repackage the meaning of ""Blackness"" into something different each generation (like we foolishly did with the word ""nigga"" and ""hotep"") but that cold, harsh truth is that ""blackness"" was **NEVER** supposed to be positive. Blackness was supposed to be a negation of whiteness.

"1. You didnt say you didnt want children. You specfically said a black son. You didnt say child or included a daughter which means you meant boys only

2. Ok thats fair

3/4. You said ""And they (the boys, really)
always seemed to have a misbehaving element about
them that was either nonexistent in other groups or far
less prevalent."" Which implies that the other groups were not misbehaving. You said nonexistent and far less prevalent which means there was little to no display of the misbehaving behavior you said black boys had. Youre esentially saying race is the reason

5. How is it misleading? So its fine to generalize a black man as a thug but not a white man as school shooter? Since they both lead in those stats they should both be fine right? You said most white men arent school shooters which is obvious just like most black men dont participate in shooting up their neighborhood. And every race kills eachother the most so that last point in that paragraph makes no sense. So the use of a gun and reasoning behind it makes the killing worse? But blame black on black crime tho right? Ive never heard of white on white crime or asian on asain crime lol. I wonder why

What do you mean they dont allow themselves to be pressured? They arent pressured at all. They can fit into any mold they want and be accepted. And do white men or other groups of men check their criminality? Id love an example of that

6. The reason I said that is because of people like you who attach things to me that I never took part or have no connection to because of what race I am. Its never anything positive. What other group is generalized like that? And I said men and women in my original post. So idk why your entire response was on where black men are lacking.

"I feel like the influence of HipHop in the black community has a positive impact and a negative impact. Hip-hop has given us people like 2pac, Kendrick Lamar, and Nipsey Hussle, but it has also glorified greed in the black community. At the same time, I believe that rappers talk about their trauma and experiences, so they shouldn't be blamed for these things. It's easy for people to scapegoat every issue in the black community to rap music, but I believe that white supremacists use those talking points to justify the conditions that black people go through. It sucks that some black people use these talking points whenever they talk about rap music, but it's part of life. 

I also feel like record labels force rappers to talk about violence and drugs because it sells more. J Cole and Kendrick are exceptions to this rule, but conscious rappers are very small compared to trap/drill rappers. I wish that there were more rappers like Nipsey Hussle that motivated people and promoted independence as opposed to signing to record labels. Concious rappers were popular 1990s because  rap wasn't as profitable as it is now. But as soon as the 2000s hit, that's when the record labels started commercializing Hip-Hop.

"I agree that rap has a positive and negative influence on our community, but imo they‚Äôre more negatives than positives. 

Most of the degeneracy today from our people whether it be robbing, stealing, gangs, etc, were influenced to think that‚Äôs okay and justified to do so by rap culture. Of course those actions were happening before the start of rap, but it was nowhere near on this scale prior to the 1970s which is when rap took off. It‚Äôs effect on us got 10x worse after the 90s which of course was 2pac‚Äôs generation. People seem to be contempt with all of this, even though they say otherwise. It‚Äôs gotten to a point to where people literally sympathize and make excuses for the messages he put in his songs. Sure yes he‚Äôd say some positive things such as his ‚ÄúTHUG LIFE‚Äù acronym among others, but there‚Äôs physically no way he actually believed any of it when he has a songs like ‚ÄúHit ‚ÄòEm Up‚Äù where he‚Äôs literally dissing people in the first verse of the damn song. Many of our men try to say he was ‚Äúmisunderstood‚Äù but those lyrics are very clear. He was not misunderstood. I‚Äôm not trying to pin everything on 2pac, many other rappers from then and even still today are doing the exact same thing. I used him as an example because he‚Äôs glorified the most.

In regards to those ‚Äúconscious‚Äù rappers, they are no better. They, like Pac absolutely do not believe what they preach. Not J Cole, nor Kendrick Lamar. I say that, because they have no integrity. They can be bought. If you gave them enough money, they‚Äôll gladly hop on a song with you talking about ‚Äúdeleting‚Äù someone. Just last year, Kendrick hopped on a song with Cardi B and Lil Durk. Both of which preached nothing but degeneracy the entire song. He even gave Kodak Black a feature last year also. If they actually believed any of that conscious stuff they wouldn‚Äôt help contribute to the very thing they argue against. 

I do want to note that I also agree that white supremacy has had it‚Äôs effect, but that‚Äôs coming an external issue from another group. Rap Culture is an internal one. We have to take some accountability. Rap culture is what gives white supremacists ammo to use against us in media and we‚Äôve been giving it to them.

I have yet to get a cohesive and logical counter argument to anything I‚Äôve said about this matter as of yet. The reason is that they can‚Äôt. Most are being willfully ignorant and biased and resort to saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre too far gone‚Äù lol.

"I've been following a very interesting development of a hip-hop scene in modern China. Initially there was an underground scene for Chinese gangster rap that was heavily cracked down on by the CCP, there's a very popular young artist called Gosh Gai. 

https://youtu.be/jwzSmRUxcBA

Basically the CCP sat him down and proposed a rebranding (proposing as adamantly as an authoritarian power could) of his image now he's a pro-nationalist, conservative blue collar rapper, and since his music is funded by one of the largest political entities on this face of the planet it's actually enjoyable. 

https://youtu.be/i7a8vwx3BPQ

The point I'm making is that hip hop much like any other form of art is a tool and the shortcomings of American hip Hop are  expressions of black male psychology.  There's good music and great artist out there. Hip-Hop being highly expressive, lyrically complex and easily consumed makes it an excellent political tool globally.

Yet the majority of music that is promoted is aggressive masculine generational angst, anger at the social, economical and political conditions were born into.


The issue is that we sold out. In the 90s Collective Black American masculinity in the expression of hip-hop bought into this debt based economic structure that markets consumerism. Every subsequent generation has replicated this capitalist model hoping that it'll be a tool of advancement. By the time artists realize the responsibility entwined with being thought leaders is often too late, as they are no longer key figures with hip hop. Rappers are aged out, and youthfulness is used as a indicator of cultural relevance.  So now we have cultures of young men, repeating the mistakes of previous generations, only listening to themselves and unable to move  forward in some of the most critical years of their life. 

The reason I bought up Gosh Gai, is that he's a great example of how the reorientation of an art form can be used to shift the consciousness of a generation, for that to happen we have to demand accountability of black men in Hip-Hop due to cultural impact. 

From  a philosophical standpoint this a chicken and an egg question. It is up to the young masses to decide if they want hedonistic or utilitarian culture, as opposition to a power structure can either be the skirmishing of guerilla warfare or a standing army united under the banner of black thought.

"You're definitely right about what 2Pac did to the black community, but he was a flawed human being. Yesterday I watched 2Pac's documentary on Hulu, and it explained how 2Pac had a very rough childhood since his mom was in the Black Panther party. Some of 2Pac's early music (2Pacalypse Now & Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z) had very strong political messages, but his music changed after 1994. The reason why 2Pac made Hit Em Up was that 2Pac was shot 5 times in New York. 2Pac felt very betrayed by black people because he tried to help his community, but those 3 black men tried to kill him. He also faced legal battles partially because a black woman falsely accused him of sexual abuse. 2Pac  felt extremely betrayed by black people, so he started dissing East Coast rappers along with Dr. Dre. All of this is covered in the 3rd episode of 2Pac's documentary. 

As far as conscious rappers go, I do agree with you that they don't always practice what they preach. Also, Kendrick never made a song with Cardi B, that was Kanye West. Although I do agree that it was a bad idea for Kendrick to put Kodak (convicted rapist) on his album where he talks about trauma. The only time J Cole contradicted himself was when people called him misogynistic during the No Name beef when he said ""It's something about the queen's tone that botherin' me"" (Snow on Tha Bluff). 

I do agree that rap culture can be extremely toxic especially when rappers brag about how much money they got. Too many black people are buying Gucci, Louis Vuitton, and Balenciaga instead of spending their money on black businesses or saving their money. The way that these rappers use their money to flex on other people is definitely concerning.

"Hm. I can't in good faith believe that rap culture explicitly justifies any of that.

Rap has a long history of being scapegoated to avoid societal issues as they apply to the Black community. Plus, rap lyrics are often a reflection of material conditions or personal experience. A lot of rappers just rap about what they know. Like for me, when I was depressed, my lyrics were melancholic. When I was optimistic, my lyrics were hopeful.

With the Black community being long impoverished and the connection between poverty and (violent) crime, unfortunately, the majority of Black rappers are going to talk about robbing, stealing, drug dealing, gang-banging, etc. For similar reasons, they also lean toward criticizing police brutality or societal oppression.

It's tougher to find that type of lived experience from white rappers like G-Eazy, Macklemore, Slim Jesus, or Jack Harlow, among others, who more or less have to emulate it. On the other hand, rappers like Eminem and Logic are exceptions because they grew up in similar environments. It's worth noting that all of them probably experience far less criticism for what they write by comparison, but I digress.

The reason why Kendrick and Cole can write a verse about gun violence and welfare is because that's the type of environment they were raised in. Kendrick watched someone get murdered when he was 5 and it's speculated that he's actually killed someone before. With Durk, he dealt with food poverty and a father in prison. Cardi used to be in a gang before she became a stripper to escape poverty/domestic violence. Kodak straight up said his career choices were either to rap or sell drugs.

There's always some type of pattern between what they lived and what they're rapping about. It's almost always coming from poverty and it takes a long time for anyone to mentally remove themselves from the conditions they grew up in, let alone having the awareness to recognize those conditions as being abnormal.

I do think it's an issue when it comes to people lying for street cred, like Rick Ross swearing he didn't spend time as a corrections officer to avoid being called a snitch. Still, the current attitude towards hip-hop feels a lot like moral panic akin to what people first thought of Jazz and the Blues. At the end of the day, it's artistic expression that may emulate real life but isn't meant to be literal. If first-person shooters and movies about serial killers are still being made, hip-hop shouldn't be this much of an issue.

If any, I think the solution is closer to looking at individual backgrounds and experiences, identifying societal issues they may deal with, and how they inform what rappers talk about. Then, tackling those societal issues at the source. At least, if there's any real concern about making rap as a genre less misogynistic and violent.

On a final note, the white supremacists using media narratives to convince people that the problem is hip-hop are just using ""violent rap"" in place of ""Black people."" The problem is just Black rappers. Like I said, white rappers likely wouldn't deal with the same critiques. As far as white supremacists are concerned, any marginalization that Black people have dealt with is irrelevant to hip-hop or just goes unaddressed and ignored to make a disingenuous and, ultimately, racist argument."

"I thought it would be the just the record labels also, but honestly I‚Äôm not so sure. OP mentioned how Nipsey Hussle spoke about wanting artists to be independent because of commercialization from the record labels so that makes the artists take on a certain persona like you were saying. The thing is, it looks like even if the artists were independent, they‚Äôd still behave and produce the same type of degenerate music. Especially for money.

NLE Choppa is a perfect example of this. He‚Äôs not the biggest rapper, but he‚Äôs not a small one either. He‚Äôs been independent his entire career and in 2020 he dropped his album where he was supposed to have stopped rapping about violence which he did, at least in that album. Fast forward 3 years later to today and he‚Äôs hopped on a song with Spottem Gottem in 2021 and dropped 2 albums in 2022 and 2023. All of which he‚Äôs made a complete 360 and is back to the same stuff he was on prior to his 2020 album.

Youngboy a bigger rapper is another example. 2 months ago he was all ‚Äústop the violence‚Äù and dropped an album that reflected that statement.

"The premise that the rappers are just expressing themselves because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what they grew up around and grew up in poverty‚Äù doesn‚Äôt hold any weight.
If that were true they still wouldn‚Äôt be rapping about nonsense later into their career. They‚Äôve been out of poverty for years, many of which for over a decade now. Proceeding on to rap about how they‚Äôre going kill someone doesn‚Äôt help their case.

Another thing to note is that prior to the 70s, black people had to deal with poverty AND Jim Crow and that still didn‚Äôt drive people to degenerate activities on a mass scale. It was until the 70s to now did all of this get worse, which is when rap blew up. Thomas Sowell, I do not agree with all matters he‚Äôs talked about, but his thoughts about rap and it‚Äôs effects are 100% correct. Most people in his generation had never even heard a gunshot growing up. Again, bear in mind, they lived under Jim Crow.

None of their experiences are by no means unique to them. Many of, if not most other black people have been exposed to the same things they‚Äôve seen. That almost makes them sound like children as if they‚Äôll never grown. Many of them are 30+ years old still talking about sliding on people.

Being raised in majority white towns is doing it.  Growing up I wasn't attracted to black women.  Also majority of the women in my town I was related to in some form so that didn't help.  It wasn't until my 30s I started finding black women attractive.  Not to mention how whites also want to push a narrative about black men.

"I'm going to make the assumption that we're talking about the US,

An Internalized white superiority complex. Black women see themselves as the victims of black men's inability to build a stable benevolent patriarchal culture (all cultures are patriarchal, we have to stop accepting the word patriarchy being used as a shaming tool) capable of protecting, providing for, appreciating, nuturing black women and the life they collectively create. That feeling goes further along the siding scale by buying into the racist narratives of American culture and the belief that black men are inherently flawed, abusive, failures, destructive, and irredeemable. 

Usually we find ourselves having cultures centering around the tragic dynamic between African American men and African American women. Which we should absolutely stop doing. There are millions of black women and men throughout Latin America and Africa that would happily welcome us with open arms. I daily have African women reaching out to me, that's not me trying to flex. Black love is alive and well.


Additionally, I want to say that not all black women in America feel this way, but enough of them do that this sentiment is prevalent and remains unchecked.

And them being ugly was a good way to cope like half a decade ago when that divestor thing was just beginning to happen and was basically just a bunch of middle aged ladies blaming their crap taste in men on all black men, but now you've got black women of all ages and varying degrees of attractiveness on the internet retorting it.

I was just on /r/blackladies and they post pictures of themselves all the time. There are a **lot** of good looking women on there. Which makes it disheartening to know that they all hate black men.

If you don't stop caring, every time you interact with a group of black women either online or in real life, you're going to get your feelings hurt because the pet hobby of a large percentage of them is bashing black men.

"Vocal minority online. And it goes both ways. I see black men bash black women in real life and online. But black women who do this and bash black men get the benefit of the doubt. They are propped up too by racist white and white-identified Asian and Latino men for upholding white supremacist anti-BM myths. It's getting out of hand. Black men and women need to discuss our issues among each other in private spaces. Stop putting this stuff online for racist anti-black people to stir up more tensions. 

I feel black people are very vulnerable to those divisive tactics because we have so much generational pain and trauma to unpack and it seems we're just now having this conversation. We're trained from a young age to demonize ourselves, demonize dark skin and African origin, we aren't taught true black history to create a stable identity and we live in a white supremacy that's pervasive in the government, media, education and legal system. Plus too many young black kids live on social media and are getting influenced by white and non-black incels and trolls. Too many digital blackfaces on forums, Reddit and Black Twitter and TikTok. Our youth needs role models more than ever. 

Black women's self hate and bad experiences with some awful black men will lead them to idolize white men (also due to white supremacy and the idea of ""marrying up"") and there's a niche of those who idolize East Asian men (anime and Kpop/drama influence). Also Latino and Arab men (thinking they're more loyal). Overall it's embarrassing because at the end of the day, those non-black men are just as toxic, abusive and will bail on their girlfriends, wives and kids. Many of them just fetishize black girls and see them for easy sex and nothing serious. I've heard and seen white women, Asian women, Arab women and Latinas complain about domestic abuse and misogyny in their cultures. It's grass is always greener fantasy, reality is much more complex. 

No group of people are perfect. You can interracially date and mind your business. Unfortunately due to the power dynamics of our society, it seems some of us just want non-black partners for proximity to whiteness rather than genuine love.

from a brown young lady standpoint, ive always wanted a black partner in a time far from this one. however ive lost hope in that since 'preferences' became a trend. i don't date but just try to make friends or have a conversation and the amount of darker guys who have a 'prejudice' against me for no other reason than im black. my mother says all skin folk ain't kin folk. however it's not just black guys but black kids i temporarily went to school with. IN MY EXPERIENCE. the white and hispanic kids i went to school with majority of the time accepted me right away. this  was one of the main reasons  i  was scared about attending an  hbcu. so as i step into university i hope that these other commenters are right but most my interactions weren't on social media. while i have seen the red pill people and the high value dudes i can say i take what they say with a grain of salt because social media can twist or reveal anything. like my ex. black presenting and making comments about his type. the only difference between me and his type was im black and his type is latinas but same body type. it's really coming down to maturity and insecurity in themselves and how their relationship is with the women in their life . as  far as my 'type' i can't say. i do feel more gravitated towards other races and ethnic backgrounds, but that's because i have exposure. my first ever bf was white. he asked me at school mind you it's first grade but ill always remember him. he told our coach he was taking me to the dance. whoever raised him had their head on right. but that's  all i can really say. maturity and insecurity.

>That's the problem lol. There's no real black male talking space. Unless you count the comment section on youtube or tiktok videos lol. This sub is mostly made up of male feminists in their early 40s that believe the black woman is god and can do no wrong and that these women are just white dudes in digital blackface.

LMAO, but it's so true. These dudes are so indoctrinated by white and black female feminist rhetoric that they can't think for themselves or act like a castrated male with no backbone. Everytime you call out this, especially to other black women, the shaming tactics and the use of buzz words like patriarchy, misogynist, protect bw, black men like non-bw, etc. commense The male panderers, simps and feminist will all join in to agree.

>They also fail to realize that women live on the internet. ""it's just the internet"" hasn't been a relevant excuse for nearly 10 years now. And a lot of these videos and tweets are averaging hundreds of thousands to over a million views and likes with thousands of women commenting on it. Nobody checks these women like black men check other black men.

If you're a Gen Z black man, then you should understand this. When we are in college within black orgs and the topic of dating comes up, the rhetoric will be no different and the only difference is that they will tone done the language. In PWIs, you see certain type of BW that believe they're above black men and feel revolted by a black man even thinking they had a chance with her. I feel even in relationships not only will there be an ethnic tax being a black man but you also have to deal with the black trauma tax."

A) a job where budget and time is minimal to complete a project but I‚Äôm surrounded by black and brown faces and am stressed but happy to have responsibilities commensurate with my skill. Or,

B) a job with ample budget but I‚Äôm one of one or two black people in the company or department and constantly facing cultural isolation

"Hey Reddit, I (35M) just got back from vacation with my girlfriend (33F) of 8 months. She was 7 weeks pregnant during our trip. Before leaving, we had a disagreement about our future child's last name. She wanted it to be hyphenated, but I'm a traditional guy and prefer just my last name.

My girlfriend had a bad experience in her previous marriage, and she says her stance on the last name is about feminism. (Im doubtful and just think her previous husband hurt her so bad she has control issues). Eventually I accepted her not taking my last name, but I am really upset about the hyphenated last name for our child.

During our vacation, we found out she had a miscarriage. We were both devastated. She thought I might leave her and even offered to take my last name. I reassured her that I'm here for her, and we discussed moving in together and trying for another baby once she heals.

I didn't bring up the last name issue again because she's still dealing with the trauma of her miscarriage. But it's important to me, and I'm not sure when the right time is to discuss it.

So, am I the jerk for wanting to talk about our child's last name while my girlfriend is going through a miscarriage? And would I be wrong for considering breaking up with her if she still wants to hyphenate our child's last name?

Edit: The last name of my children is a hill I‚Äôm willing to die on.. I am willing to compromise on a million things. In fact she basically already had first and middle names planned.. I just accepted cause I want the the last name. I understand times are changing but then maybe those new age people should date other new age people and leave us dinosaurs alone.

*Edit: Apparently My post is being followed from  feminist from another post‚Ä¶ Already received a message saying they will downvote everything.*

"I would probably recommend waiting until she is done properly grieving her miscarriage. 

Having said that, a hyphenated last name is a compromise. Many feminist would argue she shouldn‚Äôt even have to discuss that with you since she is carrying the child and birthing ‚Äúher‚Äù child. 

You wouldn‚Äôt be wrong in my opinion for breaking up with her for a difference in values. These types of discussions are supposed to happen before a child comes into the picture anyway and there are plenty of women who will give their child the last name of their father.

Good luck with whatever decision you choose

Edit: Well as you can see feminists don‚Äôt even like the compromise lol.

"First, I am sorry for your loss. Second, yes you would be wrong to bring up the name thing right now. I recommend you both take your time and energy to heal from your loss and do not bring up the last name just yet. If your children not having your last name is a deal breaker for you, then it absolutely needs to be discussed BEFORE you all conceive again. I think the best time to bring it up is when you two start to have serious conversations/plans to try again and before you all move in together. Do not start trying until you have come to an agreement. Getting pregnant again and bringing a child into this world without an agreement can cause resentment from one or both of you. 

You're not wrong for how you feel, but keep in mind that a hyphenated last name is a compromise even for her. If she is still healing from the trauma of her marriage, it may be good for you both to do couples and/or individual counseling to see if you can come to common ground.

I know this is important to you but be empathetic and give her as much time as she needs.  Her emotional healing is more important than what you want. 

I'm not sure that you should continue a long term relationship with her, especially if kids are involved and last names are of great importance to you.  We should be telling each other our deal breakers,  red flags, eccentricities and  novelties as early as possible. 

Someone who wants to rewrite the script on normative gender dynamics and lineage structure should be upfront before they actively engage in serious relationships. You two may not be a good fit for each other.

No. And if the last name is as important as you say, no, but it'll depend on who is willing to compromise on that last name.

The bit about feminism doesn't sound genuine. Most women who have wanted to hyphenate last names for themselves and/or their children have specific reasons for it like honoring their parents or pride or something like that. Not because of feminism. I suspect you are correct about her ex and having control issues, especially because she has the first and middle name planned already. But then what DO you have a say in other than providing and protection?  Perhaps this experience may be something that you really need to think over before you two try again for another child.

And whoever is harassing you in DMs and brigading your posts and comments, you're going to have to expect that, especially in this subreddit.

Good day black men. As I was reading this, I forgot what sub I was in and thought this was a white man talking. As a black man, that's all we have as black fathers, our last name, usually. What rights do we have in most states? Look how we get treated in society at times. How many billboards have you seen with a white family that includes the father? Now, how many with black families and it's the mother and kids? Same with commercials. I may be somewhere else with it, but yeah. Basically, I feel you on the issue. If you REALLY feel like she should be the mother of your child, then you most definitely should bring it back up before you shoot the club up again! If you feel like the hyphenated name won't do, then you gotta make that choice and get on with your life as it's still early in the relationship.

"Thanksgiving is for your advice.

> Edit: reading the OP ""am I an a******"" history revealed some major culture differences in African-American culture versus others. I share a last name with my father who had me out of wedlock (I'm actually a Jr), as do several of many cousins, both male and female, with their respective fathers. Quite common in the South where I'm from.

Also I feel like this is the norm for AFAs in general. I can‚Äôt think of o too many black peoples that HAD their fathers in their lives and not take their last name.. In my mind giving the child the mother‚Äôs last name whether hyphenated or note is something you do to a deadbeat who your aren‚Äôt in a relationship with.. Not someone you. Intend to marry.

That being said, I think this relationship may need to end, as the two of you have issues concerning compromise, communication, and values. As you've said, this is a dealbreaker for you.

"There was already a thread about that, but the replies were awful, like I wish I could find a more polite way to put it, but it was literally stomach churningly garbage. No *actual* advice was given, a few of the posts seem to be subtlety blaming the OP. The thread was about a **YOUNG** black man and the most upvoted post is literally just saying ""wait until you're 30 and they'll come"".

Getting dating advice as a young black man is horrible. It's nothing but victim blaming, generic ""bootstraps"" advice by old and out of touch black men, and black women and other races itching to villainize you for having any sort of preference or standard.

Especially black men who consider themselves corny or safe. I don't know how many times ""corny"" black men have to come out and tell the world that dating for them was a nightmare before people get it through their skulls. I don't understand it, What makes it worse is that modern dating is a special kind of torture for ""safe/corny"" young black men who *have standards*.

The black community is so focused on healing and therapy for black men, but then invalidate their experiences or gaslight them into thinking they're ugly or don't have good hygiene the second they vent about their dating issues or, my personal favorite, they aren't ""checking for their counterparts"" which makes no sense.

And another thing I hate is how much people pretend like there isn't a problem.

I was reading this new article about dating statistics and the stats are eye opening.

Author Jennifer Lundquist explains in **The Dating Divide: How systematic racism manifests in online dating.**[https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520293458/the-dating-divide](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520293458/the-dating-divide)

>The Dating Divide is the first comprehensive look at ""digital-xesual racism,"" a distinct form of racism that is mediated and amplified through the impersonal and anonymous context of online dating. Drawing on large-scale behavioural data from a mainstream dating website, extensive archival research, and more than seventy-five in-depth interviews with daters of diverse racial backgrounds and xesual identities, Curington, Lundquist, and Lin illustrate how the seemingly open space of the internet interacts with the loss of social inhibition in cyberspace contexts, fostering openly expressed forms of xesual racism that are rarely exposed in face-to-face encounters. The Dating Divide is a fascinating look at how a contemporary conflux of individualization, consumerism, and the proliferation of digital technologies has given rise to a unique form of gendered racism in the era of swiping right‚Äîor left.

**Jennifer‚Äôs findings:**

* Race is the biggest dealbreaker in online dating!
* White men are the most desired
* ALL WOMEN (OF ALL RACES) preferences were strongest for white men!
* Gay men (except black gay men) preferred white men
* MEN, preferred women of their own race first!
* Whiteness is the defining characteristic for women
* Digital xesual Racism is real! There is PERSISTENT ANTI-BLACKNESS that operates in the psyche of ‚ÄúWhite, Asian, Hispanic, Multi-racial, straight men and gay women‚Äù. Every group participated in anti-blackness, except black men. THIS INCLUDES GAY BLACK WOMEN.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAJcq3qMfds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAJcq3qMfds)

The average rejection rate for all men is 72.4%, and for black men it's 78.3%

Not going to lie, I've lost so much respect for black women right now, but it does line up with what I see online. Hell, in that first thread in the related threads section to the side, you could literally see an attractive black woman with a nerdy white man. Black women on reddit make up more of the users in these interracial dating subs than each race combined. Go on /r/interracialdating and it will be filled with either pictures or threads about black women in them.

I can see why so many older black men, who I assume make up the bulk of this sub, try to deny or push back, but they have to realize GenZ and the later half of GenX operate differently. You can go on tiktok or twitter right now and see black women below the age of 25 retorting divestor talking points

Now, I'm not going to deny that young black men can be just as goofy, but who gets called out more? That Passport bros tiktok video by that Korean lady was insulting because people of all races, and that included black women, weren't even trying to hide their contempt from us. And yes, the Korean lady was lumping all black men into this, she literally generalized us in the captions. ""black men in **general**""

I brought it up here and people a few months ago and people did nothing but downplay it. A video with well over a million views, 250k likes, and 23k comments full of women of all races going in on black men and the first instinct of people here was to pretend like it didn't happen or downplay it.

\---------

What's more, it seems like dating outside your race is just as hard, if not harder if you want a quality woman. The divorce rates for black men and white women are scary, I have legit **never** seen a hispanic woman I've considered attractive with a black man, Not one, but two black men have tried to (or actually have) killed themselves over being rejected by Asian women, the only black men I see getting arab women are african men in france. The list goes on.

You can't even get advice for that lol. /r/blackladies has a flair for interracial couples, but this board short circuits the second someone makes a thread about how to get a non-black woman. And if the few black men who post themselves with their gfs/wives on /r/interracialdating are anything to go by, I don't think I'd want their advice. We really need to talk about how so many black men have low standards.

I don't know what's more infuriating, as far as interracial dating goes, the fact that black men have this unidirectional love for black women and then try to guilt or gatekeep or are incompetent and  unhelpful in this situation

\-or

The fact that other races of women have the nerve to be offended or weirded out by the ""do you like black guys"" question when they know damn well that they'd be offended or even frightened if a black man asked them out. I'm actually hoping this reaches another sub so I can see their responses. I can already envision it now.

Asian women will call it fetishizing because a non-white man had the gall to find her attractive, Hispanic women will pretend like they don't call us slurs in spanish for approaching them as soon as we're out of sight, and white women will pretend like they aren't scared of us and don't laugh about it with their friends.

\----

Most black men aren't light skin, chiseled, have a full hair line, and have eurocentric facial features all in one. exceptionally good looks is more of a **requirement** for us when it isn't for these white dudes. Of course the average black chick is going to choose the above guy over an average dusty looking white dude. But an average looking white dude is more likely to get responses than an average looking black dude (hell, that same black dude can even be moderately handsome and clean too).

The same thing, if not worse, goes for the other races of women too."	Intangible_Intensity	post	28.416098517487796	female	White	0.993025541305542	na	na	na	84	blackmen

I‚Äôve made this mistake when I was younger and still see young black men repeat this pattern‚Ä¶ BUILD YOUR EMPIRE BEFORE GETTING OTHERS INVOLVED. Have your own good career, have your own car/home, and your own path to retirement before getting into the SERIOUS dating game. 

We are often second and third choice to these women. It is what it is. Make adjustments and approach with a different strategy. Make it so your inviting a woman into YOUR desirable world.

"Well man, you're probably gonna get a flurry of downvotes from a few crowds, such as the low-wattage black folks who subscribe to the one-dimensional view of what blackness is and who subsequently refute that there could be any nuance to a brother's suffering. You're probably gonna get downvotes as well by black women and demographics beyond who, for some reason, lurk this sub and will feel directly called out. I can understand feathers being ruffled.

But I also think mass media/mainstream societies gassed young black male culture up from the 80s-10s and never really recalibrated or humanized its view on that culture's inhabitants; as such, I don't think the world is ready for what you're saying. Some of it perhaps oversubscribes to sources you don't or scantily cite, and who's to really say how much we're to take from data site statistics (due to the biases that exist in their user bases, for instance).

But you do touch on some valuable truths, and if the world gets to a point where it's willing to accept and accommodate young black men in the core of what it cares about, I hope you speak up.

"29m in texas.

My advice would be for you to understand your strengths and then add to them. For example I can start a conversation with anyone so when I see an attractive girl I go up to her and I ask questions that are open ended that I know if she thinks I‚Äôm attractive too she will answer and go in to detail. I now know what questions work and don‚Äôt work So I have added to my strength.

Also if you don‚Äôt go out your social Skills and flirting skills won‚Äôt be where they need to be when you do have that bag in your 30s.

If you have a friend who frequently goes out and they seem like they are a good wing man I would start hanging out with him and hopefully what happens is some of his circle becomes your circle and then you‚Äôre able to grow your social skills which will then grow your dating skills. 

lastly black men who are in the top 10% should start acting like it just like how women with beautiful figures act like they‚Äôre the shit and by that I mean if you have a college degree no kids no felony and a job you are automatically in the top 10% of black men which means you shouldn‚Äôt be settling for anything less than the top 10% of women and that may sound fucked up and misogynistic and other things but at the end of the day its what ive seen as the truth.

"23m in Maryland

Career guy in the gov making $70k+

Black women here are just tough man. Have no problem getting women, but the battle is getting a good quality bw with adult qualities. A lot of them live in delusion and have egos out of this world. You‚Äôll have a woman that looks average (with a great career) curve a average guy for whatever reason and then complain about the men she does choose (have lack of emotional intelligence, doesn‚Äôt communicate, doesn‚Äôt show interest, no money, no aspirations, etc). 

Much of dating depends on location, and this is a sentiment I do see on this thread, so I‚Äôll concur, but what I will say, while behavior bw exemplify will very from place to place, I do tend to notice that a lot of them do still carry around that ego and false sense of ‚Äúgreatness‚Äù. I like to call it a big ego with low self esteem. Most of them tend to think fairly lowly of themselves, but outwardly, they put on a act and show high confidence to overcompensate for how they really feel about themselves.

I tend to find they think even lower of bm, with the way they talk down, demean, and hold low expectations for. 

At the end of the day though, that‚Äôs just how they are, that‚Äôs what you have to price in when you‚Äôre dealing with them. Ultimately, it depends on location and culture, because everyone is an individual. You may find many individuals who operate the same unfortunately, but it comes down to us a men to decide what we want out of a woman and accept a woman who has those traits and upbringing."

What this study fails to take into account is that when it comes to online dating most black peoples actually don‚Äôt do it..

"The thing about statistics taking from dating apps is that the results vary by the site/app the data is being pulled from, and the methodology the analysts use to obtain the data. The one you're showing is specifically from okcupid and taken in 2009. Another [study](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/11/30/247530095/are-you-interested-dating-odds-favor-white-men-asian-women) done in 2013 shows that white men are the most favored, but black women respond and reply to black men at a higher rate than any other race of men, and they get the lowest responses from every race of men (including black). But if using dating apps is a metric one thing to note is that men generally outnumber women between 2:1 and 3:1, so the average man isn't going to have success on their regardless and the women have leverage being a scarcity.

A better metric to gauge interracial relationships are marriage statistics because it's not subjective or platform dependent. According to 2021 [census data]( https://blackdemographics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Percent-of-Black-Men-and-Women-with-Black-Spouses-CHART.png), 93% of black women have black spouses and 85% of black men have black spouses. So I dont understand how you feel ""the fact that black men have this unidirectional love for black women"". The truth is as annoying as these divestor women are, they are the vocal minority. The vast majority of bw get with and have black male bfs/husbands.

Personally my fiance is a bw and we met 2 years ago on a dating app, but everybody situation is different. As far as specific dating advice goes, what are you looking for in general? This whole post is a self defeating complaint. I get the dating pool is full of piss but I mean shit you have to suck it up, swim through it to find what you want. Whether that's a black girl, white girl, other race, whatever. Also if your preference is interracial then go for it, you don't need justification or approval from anyone to do that. If you're ""villianized"" who gives af. If I'm coming off as a generic ""bootstraps"" old man then it is what it is. You're just going to have to put yourself out there, get rejected, rinse and repeat until something sticks. If you want some tips and tricks bs then maybe a PUA or passport bro sub would help."

"I agree. Dating as a black man has been quite terrible, much like anything else involving our social conditions as Americans we just make the best of bad situations. Most women are not attracted to the average black man, the mental image of black men is Idris Elba, Michael B Jordan, Chris Brown, Future, or whole slews of NFL or NBA players. For you to be of note you have to be comparable to exceptional black men.

 America really doesn't view us as a whole people, instead choosing to cling to stereotypes. I don't have any immediate solutions for you.

 The only positives I've really experienced is that it gets better with time, because people start having more realistic expectations as they age. This is if and only if you are constantly working on improving yourself, gaining high levels of income, emotional intelligence and education. We men we aren't born with value, we have to demonstrate it.

Locality also helps quite a bit, I've traveled the country extensively for work and I've always gotten the most love in the Midwest and West Coast. Places with strong black middle class communities where young people are upwardly mobile have more progressive thinkers. They've seen a wide array of black men in different professions, lifestyles, and countries of origin. Global cities are very eye-opening. I don't know where you are but, if life isn't fulfilling there I recommend you find a better city. 

Which I know you're sick of hearing all of this.  If you want a deeper understanding the social psychology or race as or impacts the disability of African Americans, I'd  recommend you read Frantz Fanon's ""Black skin, White mask"" particularly chapters 2 & 3.

"I'm a BW but a literal interracial dating sub is ofc not going to have black love and I'd say reddit in general has a lot of atypical black people, the amount of people who only or predominantly date out is probably higher than any other social media site.  I've never heard divestor rhetoric irl because that shit is insane.

Growing up I didn't even hear BW call other races of men attractive and still don't like I do online. Most people date in race but every statistic shows BM date out more so this claim of unidirectional for bw is false. Certain groups of BW online go hard for white men but most bw I know are uninterested or impartial to them.

The thing about the ""improve yourself"" tips is that it's true and better yet it's the best thing to do for your longest relationship: the one you have with yourself.

Black women aren't a monolith. A lot of what you're saying about Black woman's attitudes is exclusively online and the result of social media, unresolved trauma, and internalized racism. Shouldn't be something you pay any attention to.

You've convinced yourself that you're doomed and get frustrated with people trying to tell you that the world doesn't work the way that you've presented it here. You came here and posted one of the most debunked stats on the internet, use it to come to this conclusion:

>Not going to lie, I've lost so much respect for black women right now  
>  
>the fact that black men have this unidirectional love for black women and then try to guilt or gatekeep or are incompetent and unhelpful in this situation

Hell, shit like this:

>Asian women will call it fetishizing because a non-white man had the gall to find her attractive, Hispanic women will pretend like they don't call us slurs in spanish for approaching them as soon as we're out of sight, and white women will pretend like they aren't scared of us and don't laugh about it with their friends.

tells me that you walk into interactions already anticipating a certain outcome and have your bias confirmed when you're rejected even if it's not for the reason you've outlined. Or you only speak to women online or something because none of this makes any sense.

You need to stop making yourself miserable. You continue down this track and you'll just be falling further into this rabbit hole that YOU created. If you get rejected that shit sucks and I'm sorry but it's something that we all go through. If you keep comparing yourself to white men, you'll end up just like those incels who are mostly white themselves yet compare themselves to attractive white men and act like their doomed. Get off of the internet, stop focusing on getting women and just be yourself. 

Do things you enjoy doing, give back to your community, get a new job and get paid more, fall in love with yourself. I guarantee you that you'll met women doing this and they'll trip over themselves trying to get your attention.

First of all the dating game for men and women is completely different. Any black woman, nerdy or not, is going to have men from all races and shapes and sizes trying to court her as long as she isn‚Äôt horrifically overweight or sloppy. Most men aren't given that luxury and are gonna try to take what they can get. Don't know where this ""instathot"" argument came from. People make fun of lames flying out chicks and then not getting laid all the time, then we have all those Passportbros simping over mid 3rd world prostitutes in countries famous worldwide for its bombshells, and that pineapple show where dudes embarrass themselves trying to court women online, and all these online dating studies. People are playing coy when it's basically spelt out in math and essay and video form that men are in a constant battle for women.

leading me to my next point - most men will drop whatever bullshyt requirement they have if the first woman that looked good to them walked by. Interest and personality don't matter. Maybe there are a few cornballs that would turn down a decent looking black girl for a mid-or-below white one or a ""laura"" type chick they had no chemistry with, but I honestly don't know what reality these people live in where nerdy black guys en-masse are ignoring cute black women like that. How can you say nerdy black men aren't checking for their counterparts with a straight face when we're constantly shown just how thirsty men can get and the lows they stoop for female affection? It's a nice strawman and a good way to gaslight and ignore any real gripes nerdy bm have but it isn't realistic.

I don't even understand the ""date your counterpart"" argument, either. Why are ""nerdy"" black men the only ones that have to relegate themselves to a certain 'type'? Athletes, musicians, and the like have the entire black spectrum to choose from. They can get their ilk, they can get nerds, they can get goths, they can get whoever they please.

I'm not saying nerdy black women are ugly, I'm saying there are quite a lot of nerdy black women that are overweight and a lot of the ones that aren't are going for white and Asian men or they have the same ""type"" that other attractive black women have. There's an imbalance. a lot of the nerdy black men getting boxed out of the dating game or being expected to settle aren't completely ugly. a lot are homely sure or don't know how to dress or don't have ""swag"", but they're expected to like 1s and 2s when they might be a 4 or a 5."

You are missing the both points entirely. Myra is less attractive in the Family Matters 'verse.  Full stop. That's why it works.

The other point is that in any high density location (dating party, city, app) 80% of men will be running down 20% of women. Which is why socialization is done in classrooms, workplaces,  hobby, gym, church or even barbershop with adjacent hairdresser. People who Touch Grass, know this.

Athletes and musicians are usually with their counterparts. As are black nerds. Which you are not.

I chose the above quotes for some specific reasons. 

These quotes highlight....your problems. 

In none of your responses have you indicated that you engage in anything resembling normal social interaction. You have not posted a single example of you interacting with a woman, or aphysical description of yourself,  and have instead resorted a bunch of weirdo studies. I mean you are supposed to post an example of a date or interaction gone wrong - then seek advise, vent whatever.  Just like they do in OffMyChest and the rest.

Like you pre-emptively seeking a reason to **not** look a woman. You come of as seeming afraid of rejection, instead of seeking advice with women.

You talk about ""standards"". What are these fucking standards? I've been to the United States Northern California Berkeley/San Francisco/Oakland axis and it took deliberate effort to find a <=5 black woman. Every different species of black woman was available. And it not hard. Not hard at all. I'm at the fucking Berkeley library reading the Akira manga and have no problem setting up a friends date with a young Lady who borrowed my (LAMY Safari) pen. 

Maybe by standards,  you mean no children. But then you have your school and work peer group. Are you telling me that in situations like those, which are usually 50/50 gender, you are being rejected also? 

You say you are a nerd, but that is not what I sense,  based on your vocabulary, argument style and **especially your profile**. This might be a second account, but your DBZ obsession suggests ""anime obsessed  geek"" and not ""corny, socially awkward nerd"".

Nerds have real life interests

Geeks have pop culture obsessions

This is not gatekeeping, but necessary definitions. Having real life interests mean that you are grounded not just in specialist topics,  but the real world people and circumstances that create them. Pop culture,  encourages the exact opposite.

"Hey everyone. 

I‚Äôve been recently struggling with feelings of failure and inadequacy after receiving a mediocre ‚Äúneeds improvement‚Äù eval at work. I‚Äôve been with my organization for a little over two years and in my current role for the past six or so months and have been dedicated to my job. I‚Äôve received similar evaluations from my past employers but this has hit me particularly hard because I felt that I had grown past it in a new role with a supportive manager. This negative feedback has left me feeling like a failure to launch.

The evaluation stated that my growth has only been incremental and that I need to improve before my next evaluation or risk being demoted or let go. While criticism is part of any job it‚Äôs difficult to not take it personally and I feel like a failure. I feel like I‚Äôve let myself and everyone around me down especially since I‚Äôm only one of a handful of black folks in a PWLI. I feel like I‚Äôm not succeeding in my career as I had hoped. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do where to turn. I‚Äôm struggling with my mental health and self esteem, and I‚Äôm looking for guidance and support to help me navigate this difficult time.

"1) I'm feeling some d√©j√†vu here. Our reaction to this kind of stuff seems awfully similar to how many Black men reacted to the likes of R.Kelly, Kevin Samuels, and Bill Cosby being the focus of the internet for a brief period of time. I have noticed the pattern all too well; we seem to paranoid when morally degenerate Black males have their wrongdoings displayed for the world to criticize, as if an attack on Cosby is an attack on us. This often leads to us making defenses for their behavior or sidelining it to discuss conspiracies of a ""war on Black masculinity"".

2) Something we have an even greater negative reaction to is when Black women and Black queer people hop on these hate trains to corroborate claims of us collectively perpetuating trauma in our race (the colorism, the father absenteeism, the infidelity, the homophobia, the misogyny, etc). 

3) The collective backlash we receive for our collective behavior instills a sense of paranoia in us. We develop a ""them versus us"" mentality. The resulting feelings of shame and paranoia drive many Black men to embrace reactionary, conservative right-wing talking points about gender, race, feminism, relationships, community, etc. We flock to manosphere circles where our insecurities are exploited by White and Black men that are grifting for üíµ.

"It‚Äôs no problem. They‚Äôre also saying some nonsense about ‚Äúcollective behavior‚Äù, as if one of us represents all of us. 

It‚Äôs just a whole bunch of internalized white supremacist talking points. They don‚Äôt want Black men to be able to have the language to specifically talk about the issues that we deal with. They want us to shut up and take accountability or some silly shit

Like, for example, lynching was something that affected all Black people, but something like 97% of the people we know to have been lynched were Black men. Race and gender were taken into consideration by the lynchmobs, which means that we can see this as an act of not just racism, but also more specifically an act of anti-Black misandry. 

Same thing with police shootings, for instance Breonna Taylor was 1 of 2 Black women killed by the police that year compared to a few hundred Black men. Police violence against our communities is not simply just racism, but it‚Äôs more often than not specifically an act of anti-Black misandry.

How come Black boys are some of the most suspended and lowest performing students in schools? How did we get to the point where a supermajority of college graduates are Black women? Do Black men just naturally struggle more than their other Black peers? If it‚Äôs due to a racist curriculum and racist educators, then why do other groups of Black people perform higher than Black men? The language of Anti-Black misandry is what allows us to understand this nuanced and complex issue and directly address the problems

Our race and our gender is taken into consideration when it comes to the discrimination we face. It doesn‚Äôt need to lead to manosphere right wing bullshit when we acknowledge it, but telling people to shut up when they use this language is what pushes them there.

Having the language to talk about our issues means that we can better diagnose the problems and find more efficient solutions. How can we stand up for the collective if we don‚Äôt understand the specific ways that our demographic is vulnerable? All of us as Black people need to understand ourselves and our communities better and come together holistically without pointing the finger at anyone, because that‚Äôs exactly what *they* want."	master_blksmith	reply	na	na	na	0.9947535991668701	weak	no	no	na	blackmen
"Within the business of unburying the bones of one's childhood trauma whether for the sake of self-improvement or peace of mind, there is always an unsaid accusation of possible exaggeration, even when the act is done alone, in the sanctuary of one's own mind. Maybe you're a grown-ass man and should get over it. Maybe you're being just sensitive. Maybe it wasn't even that bad. Maybe what you experienced wasn't even ""real"" trauma.  One may even begin to hate themself for feeling this way, for this perceived betrayal of the parents who kept them fed and put a roof over their head for eighteen years.

There are few displays more damaging to the fabric of white America than a black man who unabashedly and freely expresses his emotions (whether it's tears or a fist pounded against the wall) and doesn't apologize for it. 

Tell me if any of these sound familiar:

\- ""Who you talking back to?""

\- ""A hard head makes a soft behind.""

\- ""I ain't one of your little friends.""

\- ""Fix your face.""

\- ""Better put-cho lip back in before I put it in for you!""

\- ""Stop all that crying or umma really give you something to cry about!""

You know and I know that this cruelty was an expression of love, of concern. Our parents wanted to prepare us for the white man's America in which black boys and black men obtaining rich and joyous emotional lives is not even an afterthought. But cruelty is still cruelty. Likewise, black parenting is almost synonymous with ""whuppings"" and we, black men rarely have a space to look back on these moments unless it's done for the sake of nostalgic humor. We can have our skits on YouTube. We can have our sermons where the pastor is reminiscing on his own days as a youngin' only as long as the front row's laughing with him. And only that. But what's not funny is what this all implies: that even the parental tenderness of Mama's embrace (something every child deserves, black, white, whatever) was at every moment joined at the hip with an undercurrent of fear and hostility. That there was never a true emotional sanctuary for the black boy. 

Somewhere in the equation, child-rearing was confused with spirit-breaking. Doing so much as raising your voice at elders (even if you had a good point) could earn a smack across the face or a whipping. Even soundless physical gestures made you liable for punishment  (I can still remember more than a decade later, the time I was whipped by Pops for making a dismissive waving gesture at Mama). We had no rights that Mama or Pops were bound to respect. Instead, we were taught to repress ourselves in the name of respect and obedience to authority, trained away from any curiosity and adventure outside of the black community. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you get in trouble following behind them white kids...‚Äù The world is far too reluctant to nurture black boys. We were never given the chance to be okay...

It's vital going forward to open up about these issues, cultivate a tighter loyalty among our black brothers and sisters, and understand that any rupture in this loyalty is a source of pain and confusion."

A lot of Black mothers, especially Black single mothers are exhausted from working a full shift and then having to pick up the kids and then cook, clean and raise them by themselves. It causes irrationality and you‚Äôre not thinking straight after your boss got mad at you at work, and now your two year old is screaming and crying in the back seat.

"Nailed it on the head as a fellow black man.

At the age of 32 I still have mental scars from all that nonsense. I stutter, I can barely stand up to myself because raised voices intimidate me, my heart rate speeds up whenever I see a paddle. I'm still learning to be assertive, and I have trouble raising my voice to get someone's attention. 

If I discuss this topic on Facebook as with anything discipline related. I'd get laughed at, called ""soft"" and ""sensitive"", and be told that ""I was beaten with *insert item here* and I turned out fine.""

What isn't mentioned OP that I'd like to add for the sake of debate is collective punishment methods (i.e. ""If this doesn't happen, everybody's getting a whooping."") It's just a lazy pathetic method that's horribly outdated. What do you think OP?

"I like to watch a lot dating related content. Movies, tv shows, dating channels, and such. One of my favorites is YouTuber Kendra G. She's a pretty funny and level-headed person, so it makes for great content when she brings on people who are seeking a relationship.

In one of her recent videos, she was explaining to a woman that her standards are too high considering the fact that Black men who come on the show are inundated with messages, at times totaling a thousand, while it doesn't happen in the reverse. This sort of made me think a bit because it also follows my anecdotal experiences. For instance, I know Black men who live with their girlfriends, are pursued heavily, and pretty much are treated like the prize in the relationship. 

It does technically make sense because there are more Black women than Black men, and far less educated Black men than Black women. What do you guys think, do you have any personal situations to share that perhaps matches or disagrees with mine? Are Black men the prize in a relationship?"

"I am chubby, bald, and not really the strong fat type, but I work as an engineer. I make about 85k at 27. I am in the top 3% of earners of black men in America ( however, double check me on this stat), which is alarming to me. I don't consider myself very attractive and I dress alright.  I view myself at the bottom of the dating pool and when I compare myself to other engineers, I feel like I have so much less.

I exclusively date BW, I have been complimented over doing the idealized bare minimum by BW such as taking a BW on an actual date rather than just hanging out at their house, being able to hold a conversation outside of sex, being kind, and having no kids at 27 and no toxic exes lingering around. It's stuff that is the bare minimum but they have never seen from a BM they are dating, which is just plain depressing....

BW really want an educated BM with wealth/good job, confidence, honesty, and who is kind but isn't a pushover. A good and honest BM is the prize, but that is so tremendously hard to find especially when we push the idea that attracting and being with a lot of women while we are young means you are winning as BM. What's worse is that a lot of BW see that as a successful man too.

I see alot of people talking about economics and not attractiveness. Yes it's true that black men are generally on the bottom of the social hierarchy (I believe latinos and natives are somewhat below us at least in terms of income) but the stereotypes of black people are generally in our favor and it's why BM are more likely to date out than BW. Income is not as big factor as people think it is alot of women of all races will date broke ass men Purley based of looks. If it was all a numbers game why are Asian men the most educated and highest earning men in America the least desired, they're own women date out in large numbers (50%!) and other races of women aren't interested in them. Black men's image has improved considerably thanks to sports,hip hop and Barack Obama. Secondly while it's true black men are lagging behind other races we have made progress despite the systemic racism against us. More of us are educated and apart of the middle class than ever before. Then you take into account African (Nigerians are the most educated immigrants in America) and carribean immigrants who are generally more upwardly mobile than slave descendant blacks and things begin to look better for us. The point I'm trying to make is that attraction is complicated and Isn't Purely based on social status it's a combination of many things.

"Don't beat yourself up about the house thing. My 28 year old nephew and his wife just managed to get into a house right before the interest rates skyrocketed. They are both college educated and have decent jobs and it still took family outreach to get them into a home that I frankly think costs too much. 

I was fortunate enough to purchase a home in 2014 and simply cannot believe the market value. Especially since nothing about my neighborhood or area in general has changed to justify the alleged valuation. 

Yes we are the bottom as a group. The worst part is that most of us have no idea how far down we are as a collective. I get heat when I tell other brothers that Black men, on average, are not the prize. Even those of us who have graduated from college, work white collar professions, managed to avoid getting a criminal record, and don't have a bunch of kids still do not marry at the same rate as our non Black counterparts and we tend marry out more than Black women. 

I read ""Is Marriage for White People"" years ago and it was really an eye opener on the challenges that high quality Black women are facing. I also reflected on my own lived experience with watching how my white male friends were able to navigate the dating pool (they had their choice of every middle to upper class woman of every color, race and ethnicity) and how it looked for Black men, even those who are educated, and it did not look the same."

"You should read it. It really did help me a lot with my own marriage. Trust me when I tell you this though, Black women really are not that hard to please. It's just that so many Black men are really living low. Some of it is because of long-term societal issues, but some of this is because a lot of Black men really are just not that interested in leveling up or growing up.

That's one of the reasons why I hate it when people get their relationship ideas from social media and reality shows. Most people's lives are not like that and most people don't live and behave like celebrities. Hell, I worked at a place for a decade where I saw and dealt with celebrities almost everyday and they don't really live like people think they do.

I work in tech also and I know exactly what you mean when you say you really don't see too many Black people close by to rep for you.

I do that to try and help people stay in the field. It changed my life and it bothers me that so many Black people start out, but don't stick around.

The best thing you can do for yourself, if you are not already doing it, is to volunteer with an organization that puts you in proximity of other successful men in general.

"I'm in Atlanta. I used to live in Alexandria. The cost of living up top is vicious. I have a pretty LCOL down here so my wife and I are able to do okay even though she has a disability. 

Blacks in Tech aren't very active period. I began to realize it was more for show a while back and started getting with groups where they are a lot more intentional. One of the reasons with BBBS works out is that the people there usually tend to have more empathy (they volunteering to work with disadvantaged kids after all). They also tend to have an interest in helping disadvantanged groups come up. 

I did okay with Toastmasters also, but I had to go to a group that was actually doing it for real. My local (and mostly Black) group rarely met and was not really serious. Meanwhile, the group in North Atlanta was using it as a way to build connections.

I encourage Black men to strive for success , move with integrity, and take pride in themselves and their appearance. I know I do. But the truth is the truth. I‚Äôm not even blaming Black men for it. I actually believe that this is a result of two things: 

[Social Dominance Theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_dominance_theory)

> Social dominance theory (SDT) is a social psychological theory of intergroup relations that examines the caste-like features[1] of group-based social hierarchies, and how these hierarchies remain stable and perpetuate themselves.[2] According to the theory, group-based inequalities are maintained through three primary mechanisms: institutional discrimination, aggregated individual discrimination, and behavioral asymmetry. The theory proposes that widely shared cultural ideologies (‚Äúlegitimizing myths‚Äù) provide the moral and intellectual justification for these intergroup behaviors[3] by serving to disguise privilege as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.[4] For data collection and validation of predictions, the social dominance orientation (SDO) scale was composed to measure acceptance of and desire for group-based social hierarchy,[5] which was assessed through two factors: support for group-based dominance and generalized opposition to equality, regardless of the ingroup's position in the power structure.[6]

& [Subordinate Target Male Hypothesis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-012-0243-2)

> The subordinate male target hypothesis (SMTH) claims that the discrimination experienced by the men of subordinate groups‚Äîprimarily at the hands of men of dominant groups‚Äîis greater than that experienced by the women of the same subordinate groups. In 2009, telephone survey data was collected from 414 women and 208 men in Toronto, Canada and 521 women and 245 men in Vancouver, Canada. Negative binomial regression techniques are applied to these data to determine whether and how gender (male or female), race (White or non-White), educational attainment, household income, and sexual orientation (heterosexual or non-heterosexual), as well as two-way interactions between gender and the other variables, predict scale measures of self-reported major experiences of discrimination and self-reported chronic, routine discriminatory experiences. High levels of both kinds of discrimination reported by men in general are at odds with the additive and intersectionality-inspired perspectives which accord women the gender identity most vulnerable to discrimination. Inordinately high levels of routine discrimination reported by men with a high school diploma or less are consistent with the SMTH-inspired perspective.

I am absolutely tired of black women, mainly online, accusing and generalizing black men online when it comes to interracial dating. It has been in my experience that the big elephant in the room when in comes to our community is that there is rampant internalized racism often manifested as colorism. Both genders, black men and black women, tend to validate their IR tendencies by interracial dating preferences. Black men saying BW are difficult and Black women saying BM ‚Äúain‚Äôt shit.‚Äù 

The reality is we as a people are under the same cultural influences, conditions, and circumstances. The intersection of race and gender where sexism 

Black women tend to generalize black men by saying that we all are pretty much suckers for lightskin, foreign, racially ambiguous and white women. Black people have been historically dehumanized and as a race devalued, we do it to each other (internalized). 

A lot of these types of black people feel validated when they get attention or interest from races/cultures they feel are superior to black. 

The opposite gender has devalued them and thus they seek validation from other races. The pick-me attitude. Whether this dehumanization is objective or subjective, they still seek it from a nonblack source no matter how positive a black source could be. It isn‚Äôt valued nor would it mean as much. A compliment coming from a bp to another would he ignored but a compliment from a wp would be appreciated. 

They do so much mental gymnastics to prove their point but they end up back where they started while Ignoring that the structure is working as intended and only benefits those who divided us to begin with. 

They think BM are all the same: Sports and in general entertainment does not reflect the perception of the black males viewpoint. 
The truth of the matter is:
1. Black people who were socialized as black tend to stick to black people 
2. Black women in particular have always had relationships with white men. There were entire societies built around this. 
3. Black people fell for the same brainwashing/conditioning that makes them want to dilute the African out of their blood. (internalized racism) 

When I say that BW has historically always had relationships with wm I am talking about consentual relationships systems like pla√ßage or the signares of the island of Gor√©e. Even in the 20th century, white men kept bw as mistresses. It was socially taboo for white women to rub bellies with any other race outside of white and this was strictly enforced by the threat of social ostracism. 

Something else to Remember most bm are being raised in single mother households as well by black women. I don‚Äôt see how this goes over these racists-sexist heads when they say things. 
We are not white yet the standards of their culture and their values inseminate ours especially with ideology that originally have nothing to do with black America. 


It seems a small minority of our community are the most vocal. Another thing to note, you see the same pattern play out in different societies that were subjected to the same colonial systems. India, many places in Asia, Australia, South America, and Africa, etc 


There‚Äôs also the case of black people who weren‚Äôt socialized within traditional black culture. They‚Äôre disconnected from the same ideas, values, culture, and the concepts that accompany the greater 

They push a narrative that simply doesn‚Äôt align with the culture.They‚Äôre the Markles of our worlds  but they speak the loudest and try to force the culture to adopt ideas that doesn‚Äôt represent our fight. 

Sorry for the long type but I‚Äôm tired of this narrative being pushed around by black women online. It‚Äôs toxic and only dissociate black children it shapes their perceptions in a negative way. It‚Äôs a myth that black men don‚Äôt want black women. The people they get these ideas from are celebrities and entertainers and they ignore the black women who are celebrities who do the same thing. 

Even in my case, I have always been into dark skinned black women with natural hair even back in the early to mid 2000s BUT a good majority didn‚Äôt fwm. I didn‚Äôt take this as bw they chased Lightskin/mixed dudes just as well as the dark skinned guys chased the female equivalents but the make side gets silenced by a generalization that they never participated in. I‚Äôm sick of so many black women online pretending they are victims in order to validate their bs. The sexism goes both ways. We are under the same conditions 

Y‚Äôall know the story. Hypergamy but on a massive scale 

To hide racist ideology behind preferences is ignorant and this internalized racism in the community being done by black people need to be addressed"	thedarkseducer	post	29.560856647933107	female	White	0.9651747941970825	na	na	na	74	blackmen

"Well, that's largely because Black men don't have platforms like Black women do. The largest black platforms online primarily have a black female audience (The shade room, lipstick alley...ect) so pretty much any narrative or issue in our community highlighted is going to be from the perspective of a Black woman. 

So many issues highlighted on these very platforms however are pretty much ignored in the reverse, and no one cares about the issues that Black men have within our community. For instance, colorism is a needed discussion but you're only going to hear about it when it's Black men perpetuating it against darker-skinned Black women, meanwhile, it's going to be ignored when Black women say they prefer darker-skinned black men. Interracial dating is also going to be primarily Black men dating out, but when Black women do so, it's praised and celebrated. For Black men, the narrative is that they're dating out and want non-black women, so the truth doesn't matter. That's the narrative.

When I tell you this is pretty much the only platform we have, I'm not over exaggerating. The few other Black male platforms are progressive ran hellholes where talking about issues Black men face within our own community is to be banned, meanwhile completely acceptable in virtually every online black female space."	thedarkseducer	reply	na	na	na	0.9651747941970825	no	strong	no	na	blackmen
"I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre blaming black women for this? 

White people are the ones who made black people feel worthless in this world. They colonized Africa and made us believe that light skinned Africans are more attractive than dark skinned Africans. They‚Äôre the ones who took away our religion and introduced Christianity into Africa. That‚Äôs why African leaders send their kids to western schools instead of building schools in their own country. White people have convinced us that we need to be in their society rather than creating our own society. That‚Äôs why black people are quick to support white corporations instead of building their own businesses.

My point is that, black people have lost their identity because we want to be accepted by white people. Black women have to live up to white beauty standards (Straight hair, light skin, etc.) and they don‚Äôt have any celebrities to look up to. SZA, Beyonce, Nicki Minaj etc. are black women who glorify toxic relationships in our community, don‚Äôt have natural hair, and reinforce the beauty standards for black women. I feel bad for black women since they have to live up to these high expectations, and they don‚Äôt have anyone to look up to. They‚Äôre projecting their frustration onto us because we as a community haven‚Äôt done a good job at keeping healthy relationships. That‚Äôs why we have so many single-mothers and baby mamas in our community.

Self-hate(Internal racism) is a larger issue than racism at this point. We need to love each other and build our own communities up instead of chasing white validation.

The issue with the black community is that we‚Äôre very toxic when it comes to relationships.

Black men deal with serious mental health issues because we don‚Äôt have any support, and we deal with self-hate. Mass incarceration and black-on-black crime has weakened us in America.

Crazy thing I‚Äôve noticed is the social shift. Black on black porn for instance is a niche market and the IR shift coincides with the massive access to porn in the late 2000s where the commodification of black women, Latina women, Asian women etc were made into online markets for white viewers. They took prominence over black production companies and you have had an entire generation of men and women grow up on that adopting beliefs from it. Entertainment has done a lot of harm in many aspects. Sex industry reveals this as well because people can be openly racist. 

I say this because it‚Äôs the same pattern that goes hand in hand with reality. 

We are seeing the long term effects of the mental conditioning my problem is that a lot of online platforms that are ran by black women ( a minority in the black women community) pretend as if those conditions don‚Äôt affect them and their choices are completely rational and without influence.

Of course black marriages will outpace others we have to look at it as a whole and dispel content like that which is encouraging a division in the black community as online discourses take over the main media outlets. 

Everyone have a cell phone now, everyone has access to the internet, everyone is exposed to online content and it can shape one‚Äôs perception. That‚Äôs not a valid argument anymore. Online reflected reality but reality is slowly reflecting online. Just like the doc from married at first sight brought up that statically a lot of black males that signed up for the show didn‚Äôt want to marry black women. I think he‚Äôs bullshitting but the fact that the narrative is used despite the stat that most black people marry intraracially should be noted.

"That‚Äôs why I added consensual. There were systems of placage (like the free people of color on the 19th century and the signares of the goree islands just to name a few that built societies and traditions around white men colonizing black women) 

These women were not being raped and there were systems of common law marriages. They just weren‚Äôt equal in status and it was more frequent than what a lot of people know. It wasn‚Äôt a black and white as fieldwork vs inside. They owned slaves and were never subjected to that. That‚Äôs why I added consensually and even post slavery there were consensual relationships whereas it was a social taboo for white women to do the same. 

The point still stands regardless: Black women have had relationships with White men since the slave times and all throughout the 20th century BUT black men take the heat whenever they go ir when BOTH genders are doing the same thing.

When I say, a lot of black women online generalize a lot of black men online. The implied logic is deduced to NOT ALL.

one may generalize about all people or all members of a group, based on what one knows about just one or a few people: If one meets a rude person from a given country X, one may suspect that most people in country X are rude. This

"It‚Äôs called cognitive dissonance when you gave two contradictory ideas bot beliefs. 

Look at your statement: 

You agree that black people as a whole have a lot of internalized racism but specifically, you disagree that black womenfolk put non black men on a pedestal. To affirm and validate this statement you say black men date out far more and say that most mixed kids are the result of these unions. Your last paragraph states that bw are just starting to do this in 2010 and the implied reasoning is because they took notice that bm have been like that. 

For all intents and purposes, this entire argument is fallacious for many ways and the beliefs are illogical conclusions. 

But To hold these beliefs you would have to think black men and black women live in two different societies. 

*Do you believe black men put nonblack women on a pedestal? If so why do you believe this? 

I ask this knowing whatever answer you give is biased. If black peoples are raised in an environment that conditions them to be internalized racist, black men and black women would share the same 

The problem is the usage of antecedent evidence as well, as if it‚Äôs empirical 

This is a hasty generalization as well. It‚Äôs as crazy to believe that black women value relationships with nonblack males and act correctly in those unions while not believing black men wouldnt exhibit the same pathology. It‚Äôs simply absurd. 

Does racism manifest differently depending on one‚Äôs gender identity? You can say it manifest differently but the same undertone would definitely manifest. 

In fact we have empirical evidence of this exact pathology 


*it‚Äôs illogical to think most mixed people in black America are the result of black men dating out. This is logically absurd. It doesn‚Äôt even make sense in respect to the black timeline in America. I state black women have always been subjected to IR. It was acceptable and a status symbol to have mixed children where as access for bm didn‚Äôt start until the 1940s + it was dangerous.

"I‚Äôm not disagreeing. That‚Äôs why I put online. There‚Äôs a push towards it. 

I‚Äôve been all over the world and tbh it really depends on how they were socialized growing up. I‚Äôve seen black men and black women chase after white validation like their self worth depended on it. I‚Äôve seen them used up and then try to revert back unsuccessfully. I was in the military and that‚Äôs where I affirmed that AMERICAN black women are truly one of a kind, a gem, an anomaly. I emphasize this because our women are very traditional. However, online, there‚Äôs a global rhetoric as our culture became dominant pop culture, and after the 2010 blm social movements a growing pride in the diaspora occurred BUT not all black people thought or looked at things the same especially cross-culturally. I‚Äôm going over a lot but this collective consciousness that developed in that time period and the platforms are oftentimes created and engineered by ‚Äúblack‚Äù people that weren‚Äôt even socialized as black. They were assimilated in white societies (another topic and yes I question peoples blackness. Culture is paramount because it contextualize and influences someone‚Äôs beliefs interests and actions and black people should gatekeep the culture lol :P) 

Our community is healing from a fatal wound where we lost our identity where our humanity and civil rights were nonexistent. It is a sensitive matter and it will take years to truly heal as we restore our communities. We just address the internalized racism and the issues within our community, the conditioning, but from a holistic pov and hold mfs accountable who profit and have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. We just walk in a way to achieve an exodus. 

Black men dating habits are hyper focused and the minority get the spotlight because of their status and their influence on pop culture, it becomes a generalization. They get praised or it‚Äôs oftentimes overlooked by other black men rOn the flip side, black women dating habits are validated and justified when focused, the minority that do go IR, are accepted and validated. 

In either case when black men date a white women, the people will think it‚Äôs because he thought wm were better and when a black woman does it they think it‚Äôs because she was tired of dealing with ‚Äúbm‚Äù shit. These prejudices are ingrained in black society when it‚Äôs oftentimes self serving interests for social mobility status thirst and the complex of racial pick me dating. 

The white woman as an archetype has been a symbol of white supremacy for hundreds of years. Against black women as a standard of beauty and against black men as a symbol of what cannot be attained. The engineered behavior is the affected black mind feeling the need to prove they aren‚Äôt like the others. It fuels internalized racism and made us walk like them 

No more. Some wanted to turn this ideology upside down wanting to taint them and get back, but it‚Äôs their board and a fixed game.

I see it as they both bought into the myths that were created. The conditioning to accept or to topple white European hegemony. We have a long way to go as we rediscover our identity our bodies (YAY! Natural hair movement!) and our societies. These errors need to be contextualized understood and corrected and black love is absolutely paramount for black restoration! To build and nurture a nation 

The double consciousness between being Europeanized but Foreign (Black American) accepting their culture and ours. Walking between both worlds with some polarizing themselves to one of the other. It is the root of our crisis. ESPECIALLY with the American way being to worship the individual

I tried to understand your crazy post. And also your TDRL help me understand that you just want to catch up with your snow bunnies, all the time Black women have been with a white man rather it was consensual or not. Because i look up some of the historical event you mentioned, like the Signare, and those Black women having consensual relationships with white men WERE A MINORITY. But i think i see what you meant with the traditions it left or more of an impact it left on the culture. Lightskin (men) represent wealth and darkskin (men) represent poverty but it doesn't go further than that. 
But today. IR is mostly encouraged to Black men, who happily perpetuate systems of the past, like putting these white women, who's offspring used to mean freedom, but today it means wealth while (Darkskin) Black women are degraded every time.

One it minimizes the complexity of the situation and negates the real problem. You‚Äôll get caught up arguing about semantics 
-Africa wasn‚Äôt a monolith, they were selling their pows etc 
-Africa states/kingdoms social institutions didn‚Äôt dehumanize slaves the transatlantic slave trade was chattel slavery and treated as property where as the slavery in Africa people still had a chance to be free, still had rights, etc 
-European education systems fail to talk about slavery and whitewashes it.
-the TransSahara and Barbary slave trade are not the topic (if they pull this one out of their ass but always be ready to engage if they do with facts they mostly on know surface level stuff to form simplified conclusions that makes them morally blind like the Africans sold other Africans into slavery. It can be just as stupid as saying Europeans genocided other Europeans you can point this out since they only understand and empathize with Europeans) If they say all people have endured slavery read next point

Black men today, make more money than ever, but still decide to sell out. Despite that, Black women have the choice to be with who they want and most of the time it's with Black men they want to be with. in fact, many Black women are hesitant about non Black men, especially White men because of potential racism while Black men are showing a lot of interest to non Black women and despite the fact that Black men are mostly with Black women, out of all the group of men, Black men are the one who dates out their race the most today despite the racism some of these non Black women display.

I agree that IR dating is heavily being pushed on Black people, but Black men were still the main target for the longest. And it's funny you're mentioning Netflix because this same app literally erases Black women with mixed race ones. Black women barely have representation in the US.

Not to mention that Black men are huge on advocating for tasting the rainbow while Black women in many Black-made movies, Black women are mainly paired with Black Men, especially the one that struggles at that... which also have perpetuated these traditions during slavery that being with a Black woman meant Slavery and today, being with a Black woman means you're not successful as the average Black men don't have access to non Black women like that (Notably because of geography caused by segregation and red linings). And often, Black men who prefer Black women and confess their love to Black women, will be bullied by other Black men to date and love non Black women and push their idea that non Black women are just better. Have you seen this video of sway literally bullying this Black dude on live for only confessing his love to Black women? and literally forcing the dude to say that he loves White women as well? Many of these Black male-produced movies by often depict Black men with non-Black women as love interests. And the few times Black men put Black women on the screen, this Black woman is often ridicule, made fun of or abused. Most recent example of Black women being degraded with the Show POWER, where Ghost abused his Darkskin Black wife while his white Latina side chicks was portrayed in a good light despite being a homewrecker. There it is for your example of Black women being degraded.

I feel like you're acting willfully ignorant and making this shit and making it an oppression Olympic make your entire look pointless. I'm not denying colorism against Black boys. Never, but I will not act as it follow them in the same way in adulthood. Black Boys may be told to fuck off because they are too dark but in adulthood, the same darkskin and tall stereotype will put them in an advantage compared to Darkskin Black women. Let alone the fact that Darkskin Black boys and men have more representation than Darkskin Black girls and women who are all erased by Biracials and Lightskin women.

On that note, YES, it kind of stopped when Black men had access to White women. You call me dense but you're being the dumb one here, ignoring and exaggerating some part of history to make your point which is strange for someone who swore to love Black women. It came with a double sword but the day White men started to promote Black Men as desirable, it gave Darkskin Black boys an escape from colorism for them WHEN IT COMES TO DESIRABILITY (I'm specific on desirability because it's other story when it comes to opportunities and the judicial system compare to Lightskin men), thanks to the media which gave them access to these non Black women, which help you to become the second group of men to date out the most.

Lol the moors weren‚Äôt all African people and I don‚Äôt. Where have I identified any colorist traits? Where did you see me y‚Äôall down on specifically on anything color related? Whether it was dark skinned or light skinned? Please show me where you have drawn that conclusion and from where? That‚Äôs PURE projection and it shows through your responses you are arguing with a misrepresentation of me and my point. That‚Äôs why I call it ignorant and fallacious. You just want to be right you simply didn‚Äôt understand the assignment and took offense. 

You‚Äôre just too dense to comprehend I‚Äôm talking about the underlying pathology and the false pretenses surrounding it. It‚Äôs a double standard and treated differently on the respective platforms. You‚Äôre simply ignorant and it shows. You‚Äôre trying super hard to keep up and it just shows the willful ignorance and desire to prove an uneducated point. The online divestment movement are organized and structured by the women who hold similar ideas. That doesn‚Äôt mean it is all stemming from those groups. It‚Äôs nature vs nurture. Those women are in the environment and atmosphere of such rhetoric and they formed out of that. 

Those societies weren‚Äôt minorities. There are so many examples. They also were propagated in the regions they were practiced. Even with native Americans, you see how many white people try to claim NA heritage? What laws are you envoking? After the Louisiana purchase there were laws in place to prevent marriage but that didn‚Äôt stop them from continuing those practices. 



I have to say this entire paragraph 

Historical context still being in place is debatable. Black women like signare were doing all of these things to survive because their male counterparts weren't available. Black men today, make more money than ever, but still decide to sell out. Despite that, Black women have the choice to be with who they want and most of the time it's with Black men they want to be with. in fact, many Black women are hesitant about non Black men, especially White men because of potential racism while Black men are showing a lot of interest to non Black women and despite the fact that Black men are mostly with Black women, out of all the group of men, Black men are the one who dates out their race the most today despite the racism some of these non Black women display.

It is why I find you to be ignorant. You‚Äôre literally doing what the post implies. When I am arguing we are under the same condition. No matter how you try to frame it contextually white men and black women have always been a thing. It‚Äôs overly simplified given the context of consensual relationships during those periods but the fact remains that their customs traditions etc propagated into the future whether you want to accept it or not

Netflix doesn‚Äôt erase black women. They whitewash black culture in general. You‚Äôre just mad you‚Äôre not represented in their culture. There tons of content on Netflix right now that features black people. Not a lot that represents our specific black American culture. But the examples of IR that are on that are guess what? White man black woman, bring shone in a positive affirming manner that surprisingly is cross cultural with the foreign movies

And this is where I agree. You‚Äôre right about the media. You‚Äôre absolutely fucking correct. We agree. I hate that shit. The entertainers aren‚Äôt representative of our attitude and black love is made out to not exist. But please tell me you see what I am saying. We are both pointing out the same thing except you simply believe it‚Äôs only one side doing it, I recognize it‚Äôs both. It‚Äôs a pathology of our community that only benefits ironically the same group that instrumented. 

I‚Äôm not, you just cannot except that the conditioning is the same manifested in different ways due to gender. You think magically women don‚Äôt act on the same cultural conditional somehow magically they were able to circumnavigate it but it only affected our black male children. You‚Äôre making it an oppression Olympics 

I‚Äôm simply stating we are under the same mental conditioning üòÇ this is why I said you‚Äôre being dense. Maybe you genuinely can‚Äôt understand or it‚Äôs so far out of your awareness. There‚Äôs colorism in our community but it affects both males and females in different ways. Explaining these differences and reactions doesn‚Äôt take away from who‚Äôs got it worse. In fact, I personally truly believe black women got it worse due to the intersection of race(racism) and gender(sexism) and the beauty standards. However it is equally ignorant to not recognize my bias and predisposition towards my belief. It may or may not be grounded in reality. 


Like I said explain the social mechanism necessary for a social phenomenon like colorism to affect only one gender. Look at India as an example, they‚Äôre undergoing the same exact shit. 


I hood you realize that question was a trap ü™§ it was designed to show the ignorance. It stopped when black men gained access to other races? Think about that for one second to realize your bias to even affirm a stupid statement like that.

I think it's healthy to have an outlet where Black men can vent about their feelings rather than bottle them up.

"Hey guys I am going to a wedding with my gf tomorrow we‚Äôre in an interracial relationship (she‚Äôs white). We‚Äôve been together for about a year. What really drew us to each other is we‚Äôre both educators working toward achieving higher education. She‚Äôs working on her 2nd masters. She wants to be a counselor and I‚Äôll be starting my PhD in education this summer (we‚Äôre both 26).

It‚Äôs been nice, she understands my work-school schedule and it‚Äôs been amazing dating someone who‚Äôs passionate and goal oriented. 

The wedding is for her college best friend. My gf grew up in a small conservative town and went to a small  private school (everyone knows everyone‚Äôs business). Her family has been amazing towards me, but I‚Äôm still adjusting. Even though I‚Äôm in white spaces frequently with work and school, I‚Äôm just anxious about this weekend. Not all of the people she went to school with have been approving of her being in an interracial relationship. 

I kind of feel like over the course of the rehearsal dinner and the wedding tomorrow, I‚Äôl be tested and people will want to see how I handle alcohol. My gfs sister & husband who I‚Äôm close with, won‚Äôt be there so I don‚Äôt really have a safety blanket.

The issue of the people who aren't accepting is something you need to talk about with your partner. Come up with a game plan for how to address them as a couple and if y'all encounter them alone.

"As a kid I grew up in a very white middle-class neighborhood, so I never had a chance to experience black culture. The worst part about this experience is that I started losing my identity. I was one of the only black kids at school, so I felt very isolated. My parents made Nigerian food, but they never taught me anything else about African culture. As a result of all these factors, I started loving white culture more than black culture.

When I came to middle school, I started seeing more black people there, but they told me that I'm not ""black enough"". Unfortunately, I looked down on other black people, and I thought they were acting too ""ghetto"". In 8th grade I hated black women, and the white boys exploited me at school. I allowed to use the n-word, and I even avoided black women at school. I was being a ""sellout"" without even realizing it.

In high school, I started appreciating black culture more, but my self-hatred was still affecting me. I started supporting my community more, and I listened to black musicians. Eventually I completely abandoned white culture, and I emerged myself in black culture. The problem that I'm facing right now is I'm still dealing the mental trauma of growing up in a white neighborhood and being rejected by other black people.

"You are straddling two identifies. I felt this way up until college. What I've come to realize is that there is power in both of your experiences if you remain curious. Learn more about your Nigerian heritage, through YouTube, if your immigrant parents aren't as forthcoming (like mine were). It may sound silly but there's a whole world out there to love and it starts with you. Having experienced that white environment  will then open your eyes to see how to bridge the gap whenever possible. It's not your blackness vs whiteness, it's how to embrace the greyness that you bring to a complex world full of color. 

I don't particularly understand what negative experience you've had with black woman that you distance yourself, but I do know that most black people are looking for signs/signals through physical behavior aka certain actions that typically break the ice/barrier to allow them to feel comfortable even with those that are also black. I e.the dap, head nod, and generally eye contact with the universal smile.

"I know where your coming from. I grew up similarly, but I leaned into myself more than anyone else. 

I had to start with appreciating myself for my uniqueness. I had the opportunity to witness and understand how white society treated each other and other races first hand on a daily basis. All my friends luckily were a mix of races. Asian, Hispanic, white, black, Native American. I was lucky for that. 

I‚Äôm 32 now, I have been rejected by folks who look like me, but I have found that those who do that hate themselves more than they hate you. I say this because I have also met other black people who are super supportive, or genuinely ask me how I got to where I am today and give salutes. 

I have and still do deal with depression and amongst other things on my journey to accepting who I am and leaning into it more, but what has helped the most is 1. Not worrying about what other people care about you who don‚Äôt really know you. They are only getting a snippet of your true character, therefore they have no meaningful opinion to impact your self esteem. 2. Appreciate black culture and learn more about it( this is my journey now as an adult because I didn‚Äôt have a rich black community to learn from, and still don‚Äôt) but also learn more about other cultures. I say this because I have had the opportunity to live all over the world and the more I learn about cultures I gain more perspective. Through more perspective I have changed how I interact with people spreading negativity vs. positively educating others. 3. Realize how unique you are and love yourself for it. The things you don‚Äôt like about yourself, ask yourself why and where that‚Äôs coming from. You have to live with you forever, so be kind to yourself. 4. Don‚Äôt let society define your worth or say what, who, how, or why you should or shouldn‚Äôt be a certain way. Be your own person. If you like ‚Äúwhite things‚Äù do that. If you like ‚Äúasian things‚Äù do them‚Äù. Personally, I grew up knowing how to skateboard, snowboard, speaking Spanish, eating street tacos, watching anime, and going to powwow‚Äôs. All of those things have made me be more accepting, educated out of a one dimensional field, provided cultural sensitivity, and make me the black man I am now. 

I‚Äôll leave you with this because I know that was long. You won‚Äôt be rejected by this black man on your journey.

"

I‚Äôm incredibly sorry to hear that you‚Äôre experiencing this. A quick look at your post history indicates you‚Äôve been struggling for a while and seeking support. Although it isn‚Äôt mentioned in this post, please don‚Äôt do anything hasty.

I have to preface any advice i give by saying, firstly, i‚Äôm a Black British woman of Caribbean heritage so although i can‚Äôt relate to your experiences i empathise with your pain. Secondly, I understand that you wanted advice from men which means as a woman i know this isn‚Äôt my space. I joined this sub a long time ago to quietly learn about the Black male experience but reading your post i felt really disquieted that someone so young feels this way.

It‚Äôs definitely commendable that you have this level of self- awareness to articulate your emotions so cut yourself some slack üòä

There are two routes i‚Äôve witnessed which ameliorate self- hatred. Physical and spiritual healing. 

It‚Äôs impossible to begin to accept yourself without knowing yourself. As Marcus Garvey said ‚ÄúA people‚ÄØwithout‚ÄØknowledge of their past history, origin and culture is like a‚ÄØtree without roots.‚Äù Your self- hatred is a direct result of not knowing your origin. 

African- American culture is vast, unique and beautiful in many ways from the storytelling, food, traditions in Louisiana and New Orleans to fine art, scientific achievements, tap dance, and musical developments in the North. 

However, this isn‚Äôt your culture. By all means appreciate it, enjoy it, participate in it, and support it but remember you‚Äôre of Nigerian heritage which too is vast, beautiful, and unique. From The Kingdoms of Ife, Sungbo's Eredo, Igbo, Yoruba, and Anambra folklore, the clothing, languages, food, and cultural traditions. If your parents aren‚Äôt interested in teaching you then ask cousins, Aunts, Uncles, Grand- parents, read books, watch Youtubers like Tayo Aino, Wode Maya, or Passport Heavy as they visit Nigeria and Africa to show the modern developments in ways the West won‚Äôt. 

If it isn‚Äôt possible for you to visit in person right now then search online for the diaspora. Perhaps there are Nigerian restaurants or community activities in a nearby city. I‚Äôm sure there is a Nigerian ‚ÄúAunty‚Äù or ‚ÄúUncle‚Äù eager to share over a plate of Fufu!

The opportunities are endless for you to immerse yourself and i guarantee once your parents see you learning and loving your culture without them they will begin to take an interest. Furthermore, your peers will see your confidence and respect you more.

Secondly, there‚Äôs the spiritual side and i‚Äôll try to keep it brief as i‚Äôve already written an essay lol! Please understand that you aren‚Äôt on this Earth by mistake. As a Christian i can only encourage you with scripture- which says ‚Äúyou were purposefully and wonderfully made‚Äù- Psalm 139: 14. 

This means that when God created you, God deliberately decided that your skin would be that rich complexion, the texture of your hair, the fullness of your lips, your height and everything else about your physical make- up! What God created as beauty, the world will always treat inadequately.

So look in the mirror with a sense of awe that just like the mountains and the seas, you‚Äôre the deliberate work of God‚Äôs Mighty Hands. I pray that instils confidence not shame. Even if people don‚Äôt appreciate you love yourself; because God does.

God bless and all the best x"	Buddymaster39449	reply	na	na	na	0.010200992226600647	strong	no	no	na	blackmen
"I think the main thing is that you should forgive yourself. There are plenty of Black kids who grew up in predominantly white neighborhoods and/or who went to white schools, and who absorbed harmful racist ideas in order to fit in. It's unfair to think that a kid would even be able to form a strong sense of self in that kind of environment.

Also you don't have to completely abandon white culture, especially parts that you like. I think part of what it means to be Black is to be yourself, and to accept yourself despite how others (White or Black) say you should act.

"I'm pretty open-minded usually, and I definitely find myself agreeing mostly with progressive politics, but lately, I've started to hear this term used more frequently. Maybe it's the circles I'm in, or whatever but I found it interesting. I think in general most groups by definition have some sort of privilege, but it's a matter of whether we find the specific form of privilege so problematic that we attempt to address it as a society.

An example of male privilege could be that you're not afraid of being sexually assaulted while out at night. An example of female privilege would be that you're not expected to go to war, or you're not told to 'man up' when you get emotional. Regardless of which has more weight, we've decided as a society that male privilege is more important to address so that's the current state of things. 

I don't have an issue with people who seek to address male privilege, but for whatever reason, it feels so disturbing when they attach 'black' to it, and we're told to address/acknowledge it. From my perspective, in the US because we're black and male we get targeted and murdered by the police/racist vigilantes, which women mostly do not have to deal with. So to be candid about my personal feelings, does it really warrant addressing 'black male privilege' rather than 'male privilege' to a group as disadvantaged as Black men? I'd like to ask you guys that and do you believe Black male privilege specifically (not male privilege) exists?"

"I think that there's a certain level of privilege when it comes to black men and black women. I as a black man have to deal with the struggles of being black. Black women have to deal with the struggles of being black AND being a woman so their load is probably going to be a little heavier to bury if I compare myself to my closest female equivalent. Outside of that very specific comparison I don't really think there's much to be said for the ""black"" in black male privilege. 

I'll use an example. Right after Trump got elected one of my best friends (who is Pakistani) and his white wife were planning to go to one of the women's rallies that were being held after the ""grab em by the pussy"" thing blew up. My friend's wife asked if I was going when I had come to visit one day and I said no because I'm not really a ""protest guy"" and was hoping to leave it at that. She kept trying to convince me that this was something I just HAD to do to show that I supported women. I refused a few more times before she said ""your mom would want you to go"". I explained that my mom would never suggest that I go to something like that because being around that many amped up white women is actually not safe for me at all. If anything negative jumps off it'd be a problem for me. If someone brushes up too closely to someone while walking past and I'm nearby I could end up catching heat. And I'm one white woman screaming away from the police getting involved and being in actual danger. I outlined the stuff that I do to try and be an ally from a distance because it actually felt super unsafe to even consider going to one of those rallies. She eventually dropped it but it was more because she realized I wasn't budging and not because she understood where I was coming from. 

I had similar situations all throughout college and shortly thereafter when I was hanging out with a lot more white people. There is basically this unspoken assumption that I should be risking my freedom and safety to step in on behalf of women despite the dangers being much more real for me than a white man. And there's no feeling of reciprocation. The same woman that was basically demanding that I come out for her rally had made 0 effort to come out to any of the rallies held in my city for black people who had been killed by police. Never get a call like ""what can I do to help"" or anything like that. A lot of white women pretend like they are unaware of the dynamic between them and black men but they don't have a problem playing into it when it suits them. So I find it difficult to take any claim that somehow being a black man grants more privilege than being a white woman."	GasketMax	reply	na	na	na	0.006161024793982506	no	strong	no	na	blackmen

In America specifically, because I‚Äôm sure this conversations changes in homogenous black countries, I think black men can have male privilege but black male privilege specifically sounds dumb. If the Male privilege can only sometimes be upheld over black female then it‚Äôs just intracommunity male privilege. We don‚Äôt often have access to it outside of our community because we are black. We don‚Äôt often male privilege over non black women because of racism. I think they would sooner hire a Karen than a De‚ÄôAndre. But intra community I guess I could see it existing. I know that there are people that prefer to hire men in general over women, and in a community group I‚Äôm involved with they go out of their way to get men over women. We are often seen as more capable. There‚Äôs studies in hiring practices where people will go out of their way not to hire women because they might become pregnant. Or denying women promotions because they have families or they are family planning but will give it to men. Or situations where men will speak over women and out talk them because they want to dominate the conversation or prove that they are better or smarter. Women are often solely responsible for child rearing and in fact that have that expectation of caring for children alone which is why single parent, women led households are statistically high for us. Of course these takes lack some nuance!!! But these are situations where misogyny is involved and male privilege plays a role. As men we can definitely add to that. I think what makes people think we don‚Äôt have some privilege is because were black. But it‚Äôs like if you tell a whites person they are privilege they talk about being mentally ill , poor, disabled, and having experienced police brutality‚Ä¶ It doesn‚Äôt detract from your whiteness but it does make life more difficult for you, that doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt experience some privilege, it just means you have less access to it due to your marginalized identities.

"I actually think you‚Äôre misunderstanding black privilege in the same way white people misunderstand white privilege.

Having privilege due to blackness does not mean you don‚Äôt have problems due to it too. It does not mean your life is easy. 

For example, I have tall privilege. It means women find me more attractive by default. It also means people listen to me easier. You can call this the privilege of being tall. But it also means I can‚Äôt fit in normal clothes, I can‚Äôt fit on standard aeroplane seats and my shoe size is always sold out. But I still have privileges associated with my height. So I still have tall privilege.

Similarly I have black privilege. People think I‚Äôm cool or gifted. They assume I can dance or sing or that I‚Äôll be physically capable. I‚Äôm the last person someone will pick a fight with. But I also suffer racism, people don‚Äôt trust me, or are scared of me, I‚Äôm overlooked for promotions etc. That doesn‚Äôt invalidate my black privileges though.

Lastly a white person will tell you, their white privilege allows them to easily find work, they are accepted everywhere, nobody finds them threatening. They will be listened too and supported in every situation. This is white privilege. They will also have to bear the negative backlash from the actions of their peers or ancestors. Black people will mistrust them by default. They will find it harder to understand or accept other racial realities. Again, it doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt experience white privilege.

"You could say that. But over-policing is something that I would classify as a black issue more than a man issue. Men in general are sentenced harsher for crimes because men generally employ more violent tactics for a crime. Like if someone robs a store clerk at gunpoint it's statistically going to be a man. Women will usually just try to find a way to rob the store unnoticed. Doesn't mean they both aren't stealing. But it does mean that if they get caught their cases will be treated differently.  Black women get followed around the store just like black men do and when compared to their white counterparts black women receive harsher sentences just like we do. 

But this whole issue of trying to prove that black women have it easier than men is not really helpful in my opinion. The grass will always be greener on the other side. Women probably aren't getting sentenced to the same degree as men but men are also less likely to be hospitalized or killed as a result of domestic abuse. It doesn't mean that men aren't being abused because they are. But women are just more likely to be victims of violence and experience more extreme violence even when you factor in that men and women perpetrate violence at similar rates (there's a lot of DV in lesbian relationships that doesn't get spotlighted). Black women are more employed than black men but our annual earnings are about the same which means black men make more money overall. Trying to nail down who really has it easier when both black men and black women are essentially on the bottom rung of the class system isn't really going to help us move forward. If you believe that men have it harder than women then to me this is arguing about black men playing on expert mode and black women playing on hard. They're both insanely difficult when our counterparts are playing on easy and very easy. That's why my example is more about interactions with someone outside of the race."

"I'm definitely not denying Black women have it bad nor saying Black men have it worse. For me when we talk about these topics or privileges....etc it feels like we're not acknowledging (as we do with black women) that specifically because we're Black and male we go through certain disadvantages in society. That's not taking anything away from what Black women go through because they're black and female.

I see your point about the over-policing, but it only happens because we're black + male. I'm not saying at times women aren't the victims of police violence, but no black woman in the world is afraid an officer might mistake her reaching for a gun when she tried to get her license. There's a reason young black boys are given the talk.

Men do more time in general for the exact same crime as women, which almost all data backs up. When it comes to race Black men are seen as violent, so in general, people tack that on which is why we get sentences larger than any other group, are the most exonerated, and are the most likely to be convicted. You're correct that Black women get followed as well, but who do you think is more likely to be followed?

"I'm a very large and unkempt black man so I'm not going to sit here and act like I never get followed but I also know that my much more presentable wife gets followed around stores pretty regularly as well.  That's what I'm getting at. Some black men and some black women like to say ""I get that they got problems but MY problem is soooooo much worse"". It's counterproductive to me to try and compare something like the constant threat of police brutality to the constant threat of something like sexual violence. Black men are disproportionately exposed to one. Black women are disproportionately exposed to the other. They're both deplorable. They are both systemic/societal issues. They both target us more than they target other groups. In terms of determining which is worse it's going to boil down to personal opinion. From where I sit some of the stuff that I have seen black women go through looks like it's so much worse than what I go through as a black man. It doesn't mean that I don't get uneasy around police or that I don't get annoyed with certain aspects of society's treatment of me. But looking at their situation and my situation I'd probably still pick being a black man because it seems easier to me (albeit slightly) for me to move through society as a black man than as a black woman.

"I think it‚Äôs meant to be specific because the term is to show who has the privilege. We as black men do have privileges due to being at the top of the black community social ladder by nature of being male.

I mean black women are kicking ass in more categories than we are, but we still hold majority influence over the community despite this.

"This argument misunderstands the concept of privilege in my eyes. For example, there are people who are white who come from poor communities with little access to education or healthcare‚Ä¶. BUT they still have white privilege. 

That is because having white privilege does not mean you personally are successful. It means you are treated better vs another person in the SAME situation who is not white.

If you turn this around, are there examples where a black person is treated better than a white person in the SAME situation. Well yeah, a black person will by default be assumed to have better natural ability than a white one. That is a black privilege.

It doesn‚Äôt mean that black people don‚Äôt rank worse in most societal metrics. I completely agree with you about that btw. But that has nothing to do with the concept of privilege.

"You make some interesting points, but I'm still not seeing how this is a privilege of black men specifically because it's seen across all races of men. If you said male privilege, I 100% agree with you. I think we can both acknowledge that men and women have privileges associated with their sex, but we've decided male privilege is more damaging currently. If we're being honest here, whether black male privilege exists or not - just as we do with female privilege, it's not that important to address it to black men who are dealing with police murders, violent racism, and below Black women in almost every metric of success that exists. Not to mention the 5th leading cause of death for a black man in the US is homicide. Addressing Male privilege would be a much better way of solving issues. 

For black men not being held accountable for infidelity, I don't understand how they would get away with it. I'm sure most divorces are the result of cheating which is a consequence of itself unless you're saying this is somehow societally reinforced, which I disagree with. Go to the shade room, social media or pretty much anywhere. Udoka got a lot of heat for cheating which resulted in him splitting up with her, as did TJ holmes.

""not necessarily being held to responsibility of raising kids we create. I‚Äôve seen plenty of men have children with multiple women and waltz of Scott free with no responsibility.

But this can apply to pretty much any race of male in the US that doesn't have some sort of religious reinforcement. The government literally had to create child support because so many fathers were walking out with no intention of raising their children. A black man could do that, a Hispanic man could do it, and a white man could because like black men they could be free of responsibility if they chose so, hence why child support was made. Also, I disagree with the notion that it is praised amongst black men. Nick Cannon gets a lot of hate in the black community, and black births are overall down in the community. The reality is that it is an issue of marriage because most of the guys want sex, not children.

"Ok so in all honesty when I hear black male privilege, I almost always see it used within the confines of the black community. I‚Äôve never seen a person say black male privilege applies at the whole of society, like for example I‚Äôve never seen a white person saying we have black male privilege in America in a comparable context as white male privilege, that would be factually incorrct. I‚Äôve only really seen the term ‚Äòblack male privilege‚Äô come from members of our community who are not straight, black men. So, i think the term is one that is referenced within the confines of the black community towards the level of power and change that is achievable within American society for Black people as individual demographics within our own community. I don‚Äôt see it as being applied to having privilege in all of America. I think whats being pointed out by this phrase is that black men should have the easiest shot for mobility and advancement out of our community due to most being straight, and being a man.

All of what you mentioned is something we all experience as a group of people. Sure, solving male privilege is the overall solution, but I think that‚Äôs missing the point. The phrase isn‚Äôt directed at other men, it‚Äôs a phrase created by other members in our community who realizes that we are in an advantageous position compared to anyone else. I think the point is that whether we like it or not it or not, with the way society is created, black men have the most ease to create wide-sweeping changes within our community which is closer to home.

"""it‚Äôs a phrase created by other members in our community who realizes that we are in an advantageous position compared to anyone else"" But that's the point of contention here. Is it really that advantageous to be a black male specifically within the black community? Even if you were to say it's still advantageous within the community, it would be such a minor advantage that it wouldn't even be worth talking about. That's because since we're male and black there are specific and often deadly disadvantages that come with that.

""black men have the most ease to create wide-sweeping changes within our community which is closer to home""
I don't agree. Look at virtually all movements against racism...ect in the Black community and you will notice it's primarily led by Black women. Black Lives Matter was created and primarily led by Black women. In fact, you could argue the contrary. Black women definitely have more power in the democratic party than Black men, which is evident by the fact that Biden said from start to finish he was nominating a Black female supreme court justice, and are the leaders and higher-ups of virtually all of these political movements (Black voters matter, Black lives matter, the women's march) this is not even mentioning Black women statistically are doing MUCH better than Black men, which allows one to create better change in general.

It's fair to say something doesn't represent the whole of the black community due to it being on social media, but most people in the US have one of these apps they use (twitter, facebook...ect). We could also draw from real-life data as I did previously that says births in the Black community are down. Even if true, this would still not be an example of Black male privilege, because remember you should not be able to extend this to other groups. If a male privilege is that you're able to get away with being loud, for it to be considered a privilege women in this particular society would simply not get away with it. Being able to abandon children as I stated earlier definitely extends to all-male groups, and divorce itself is a consequence for cheating."

The common theme I'm seeing is that it is a problem for black men to be in interracial relationships especially with white women. I don't want to point fingers but I see alot this animosity  coming the most from black women but also from occasionally from other races of men. They cant seem to stop making posts across social media complaining or criticizing our relationships and even our offspring with women of other races.

My wife is black, but when I was a lot younger in my 20s I dated a lot of different races of women and I was heavily criticized by black women and some black men.	wombo_combo12	reply	na	na	na	0.9983982443809509	no	no	no	na	blackmen
"So I talk to my girl about this recently. It's a psychological thing. When you think ""interracial dating"" the first image that comes up is black man white woman. That didn't happen by accident is all I will say. Me personally I wouldn't suggest it (stepma is white, Dad got married to another white woman who is a few years older than me after her, and I've dated them also and just think they don't have our best interests in the long run imo).

"Hmmm‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I personally think it‚Äôs because the best and brightest are leaving our community.

Usually when a BM is dating outside of his race in America/UK (not the broader world because I don‚Äôt notice this in Latam or southern Europe). They are hitting certain life milestones and want to then date out. 

But the same thing goes for BW too. They will become a more soft and loving partner for a White guy then they would for a BM. I am not knocking it and personally think it‚Äôs beautiful that you can finally open up to someone but it‚Äôs a shame you can‚Äôt do that with your own race. 

Both groups seem to be annoyed that you are taking your resources to another group. I do believe at this moment in TIME it can be seen as harder to be in a relationship with your own but the long term rewards will be better for you and the broader community.

This is something I noticed a lot with my friends from India or certain South East Asian countries but it‚Äôs happening here now too. 

All that to say is that you should love who you want to love but don‚Äôt do it as a way to shit on BW and for BW don‚Äôt do it as a way to shit on BM. I‚Äôve seen WAY to much of that recently and it‚Äôs pretty disturbing"	wombo_combo12	reply	na	na	na	0.9983982443809509	no	strong	no	na	blackmen

I remember when Bronny James (The son of Lebron James) who was 16/17 was being discussed largely on social media because he posted a TikTok of women he was attracted to, who happened to be lighter-skinned Black women.

Just look at interracial dating groups member counts. BW4WM(ot any non-black man) groups, whether it be on Reddit, Facebook or anywhere, always dwarf BM4WW dating groups in member count.

I was a pretty solid athlete, but I was still classified as ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù in graduate school that has changed some. 

Even though I was into BW, I was often viewed as ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù and that, at the schools I went to were considered ‚Äúbad‚Äù traits. So in a sense, I was on the outside looking in. Women from other races, showed a liking to me so I went with that. I never sought out women from other races, it was mainly who reciprocated feelings etc. 

Being a BM, I‚Äôve just accepted that no matter what I‚Äôll do there will be criticism. Either from black people saying  I‚Äôm ‚Äúwashed out‚Äù or doing a disservice or from white people who will give me a side eye to my gf & I wondering why she‚Äôs dating me.

"It‚Äôs largely just jealousy that black men can date out while black women cannot. We know this to be the case given the differential (favorable) treatment black women receive when they‚Äôre dating a non black man. 

Black women are the least desirable race of women which largely impacts their ability to be cuffed by other race of men. The factors that render black women unattractive make black men attractive (black skin being perceived as masculine, hyper sexuality, etc) also doesn‚Äôt hurt that black men are taller than other races on average(excluding whites).

If black women could date out more than black men the narrative would be very different. We know this to be the case because we can analyze Asian women and the nature of discussions around interracial dating in the Asian community.

American Asian women (43% of whom are either married to or cohabitating with white men) often complain about fetishization only when Asian men are desired by non Asian women. However, they ostensibly have no issue with this when the plurality of them are shacked up with white men, rather than their own race of men."	wombo_combo12	reply	na	na	na	0.9983982443809509	no	strong	no	na	blackmen

"Unless the black men in this situation are expressing a racial preference, then I don't know why they would be receiving hate. America has a very weird obsession with race, and opinions have become a pandemic second to none. They want you to do some deep, psychological self-reflection to understand your attraction to other races, and your preference for that race over your own, which then ties back to your perception of black women. You can date ten black women, and one white woman. If you're currently dating a white woman, no one knows about the ten black women you dated before. They only know what they see, and that's what they judge. You fall under this umbrella of black men who date white women and trash black women, even if you don't think the way these men do or agree with them. I guess it's like a guilty by association thing. Someone is so used to seeing so many black men (who date white women) with bad opinions of black women, so they assume every black man dating a white woman has those opinions or that mindset. 

Similarly, it might not be about assuming the mindset of the black man dating the white woman. It might be about having feelings of betrayal. Believing that the black man has turned his back on his race by dating outside of it. It could also be about people wanting to keep the black race strong and pure and believing that white people are purposely making us genetically weaker. It could be internalized/externalized hatred towards white people, which I've seen **a lot** of...people who can't even comprehend why a black person would date a white person, expressing all of the...honestly vile shit white people have done to our people (and often still do to us), like eating us, lynching us, experimenting on us, stealing our body parts for themselves, etc...but that's some sick shit, some conspiratorial and some factual, and I'm getting off-topic üòÇ

The point is that there are certain type of black men who date white women and have a shitty opinion about black women, and that people just have a negative opinion of white people and therefore any black man dating one is poorly received.

In polite society, bigotry is looked down upon. You think the people you come across in day-to-day life don‚Äôt have prejudices or bigoted beliefs just bc they don‚Äôt tell you to your face about it? The Internet provides a level of protection, and in many cases, some anonymity, which allows people in the real world to share their most honest ‚Äúreal world‚Äù feelings and beliefs that they‚Äôre less likely to share in the real world.

At some point instead of dying on a hill to be right.  Just say I misinterpreted your intent.

And let's be real, most of these conversations are happening on Twitter,  Facebook, IG, etc.   I am not on any of those and there are millions of others who are not 

Hell even if you go on the sub Black Twitter you pretty much get crucified for talking down on interracial dating.   

My point is that many times topics are brought up that a segment of SM are debating that black people or people in general are not even talking about.

Bottom line is I disagree with your take"	wombo_combo12	reply	na	na	na	0.9983982443809509	no	no	no	na	blackmen

"You're not 100% incorrect in acknowledging there are more people off these platforms than on, and that social media can distort the actual societal attitudes toward certain issues, but in regards to interracial dating, the societal attitude most certainly matches social media.

Let's start with most people not being on these platforms. Well not only is Twitter, Facebook, IG...ect heavily used in the US, but I truly doubt most people don't have or use a social media app and for younger people your talking 85%+ who at least have one of them. Not to mention it's a common talking point in the black community of Black men dating out, the popularity of figures in the black community such as Umar Johnson who calls out primarily Black men for dating out, and Black female forums such as Lipstick alley."	wombo_combo12	reply	na	na	na	0.9983982443809509	no	no	no	na	blackmen

"It never mattered what others thought of us, the only important thought was how we perceived ourselves. The civil rights movement was an affirmation of our self worth to ourselves, with self worth comes self improvement - be that in the pursuit of university, becoming a better fighter or solider, and even in how we respect other humans. The civil rights movement is one of the greatest positive contributors to the soul of the human race since the magna carta.   


The movement is proof that we don't need anyone's support to change the world, we have to be just as strong as we are kind.  So treat people BETTER, than any of those races - become the example of what a real human should be, and for heavens sake, get your ass in the gym and train.  All of you here, every day, train your mind, and your body. Why would we wait for there support?  We are the leaders in human rights across the entire planet right now, the world looks to our culture when fascists squeeze their necks - the current youth use hip hop to voice political concerns, and civil rights hero's to model there counter attacks after. We don't need their support, they need OUR support, and we are effective at the support we give."	Steakhouse42	reply	na	na	na	0.9977095127105713	no	no	no	na	blackmen
"American society was built on oppression of Black people and Native Americans. Asians were never oppressed to the extent we were and Japanese got an apology and reparations for the internment camps. And Hispanics who aren't black or Indigenous looking (eg the Jennifer Lopez/Ricky Martin types) identify with whiteness and are socialized as white even if they are mixed. They play the minority card similar to how white-passing Jews to deny their privilege. They absolutely benefited from the movements that Black Americans (and Caribbeans) and Native Americans fought and died for. The Civil Rights Movement was no error. It inspired billions around the world including Nelson Mandela. It's something we should hold pride in. Black North Americans are still disrespected at an incredibly disgusting level. We need to be protective of our culture and reject this ""people of color"" nonsense and stop letting everyone in and claiming them. Stop letting white liberals be out mouthpieces too. There's no such thing as ""gatekeeping"" in regards to preserving one's cultural heritage and focusing on our own specific issues and concerns."

This is an extreme view no matter which way you slice it. Are other groups generally anti black? Yeah but to say that the civil rights movement was mistake is bad because without we wouldn't have any rights and have no opportunities to move up in American society. All ethnic groups generally act within their own interests that's the way it is in the world and it's no different in America. White people don't exactly like other minorities either maybe not as much as us but trumps anti immigrant rhetoric was popular with white Americans for a reason. Also there is alot of tension within those groups aswell as Asians don't like other Asians of different ethnicities and Latinos don't like Latinos of other ethnicities.

The biggest mistake of the civil rights movement was economics. Where we had Black-owned businesses, Black folks were encouraged to spend their money in white-owned businesses with no demand that whites spend their money in Black-owned businesses. Without this cross flow of money they white economy grew while the Black economy diminished.

">The civil rights movement was an affirmation of our self worth to ourselves, 

A lot of black people on the radically left side of politics would disagree with this. Many, like the Black Panthers, felt that the civil rights movement was a way for disenfranchised blacks to get white people to let them have access to their institutions. Cultural nationalists make the argument that nationalism is the pinnacle of self-love, and the wanting to integrate into communes that white people created instead seeking to build our own was a serious symptom of black people's undying desire to have their humanity validated by the Anglo world.
