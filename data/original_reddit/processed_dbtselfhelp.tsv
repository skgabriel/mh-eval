"I’m in a structured DBT program with group therapy, individual therapy, and phone coaching.

My group is really boring and unhelpful. It’s over zoom which is fine, but the majority of the time is spent on homework review and not actually learning skills. The group leader will call on each person and have them go through each individual line of the homework and basically have a one-on-one conversation with them for 15 minutes while the rest of us sit in complete silence on mute. It’s so monotonous and boring I can’t stand it. If someone shows up late or doesn’t do their homework it’s a 5 minute conversation with the group leader one-on-one again with all of us sitting in silence while we listen to “I got busy with work and then this happened and then this happened blah blah I won’t do it next time….” Like we’ll be doing this for an hour. To actually do the homework I have to read the skills on how to do it myself, so I’m wondering what I’m paying for in the sessions. 

In my one-one-one sessions, my therapist doesn’t actually want to listen to me and is very focused on just talking about the skills. I’ll be in the middle of explaining something that upset me this week and she’ll cut me off and say “we only have 35 minutes left, we need to wrap this up and go over the skill to work on it”. I was upset last week and wanted to rage on my doctor because he prescribed a med that was giving me sexual side effects, and I tend to hate doctors because they piss me off but I’m trying to get over that. My therapist got short with me and said “it’s too early to have sexual side effects on that low of a dose so it’s your anxiety. Maybe right now you need to focus on getting stable instead of having mind-blowing sex” and that hurt my fucking feelings a lot. 

Honestly I hate her and I hate the group and I know DBT could potentially help me with my anger and rumination but my anger at the program is getting in the way of making progress. It’s out of pocket for me so I’m even more frustrated with that. I feel like I’d be better off just reading the book myself and getting a therapist in network that I actually like who is DBT-trained to go through it with me. 

Is this normal to feel this way? Am I overreacting?"	0010011010110100111	post	26.68706836222597	female	White	0.9995161294937134	na	na	na	9	dbtselfhelp
"I'm sorry your therapist invalidated you like that, that sucks. It also rubs me the wrong way how they responded to you in the example you gave about the convo about your medicine. With the other things though, in terms of the structure, that is all pretty typical of a DBT group. Starting out by having members go over their homework one by one for a few minutes each, and then moving onto the new skill of the week... It really does eat up a good chunk of the time, and can often be a little more than half of the hour. That is also why going into a lot of specifics one-on-one for things that are personal and may take a while is often stopped and redirected to your next individual session so it doesn't take up too much group time. But still, the way your T worded it was unnecessary in my opinion. But also, the homework review shouldn't take so much time that you only have like 15 minutes or something to go over the new material. That is a sign that your T may need to split up the group into two...or go to having it be 2 hours long if it isn't already, which is standard in DBT for this reason. This way, there is enough time for homework review, mindfulness exercises, new skills, and Q&A time. 

But yeah, it seems like your T's *attitude* would be a real issue for me, and if it is to you, you might want to switch. But the overall structure you're doing in group will be essentially the same no matter where you go for DBT, just hopefully with good time-management."	0010011010110100111	reply	na	na	na	0.9995161294937134	strong	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Your feelings are valid and your frustration is certainly understandable. That sounds like an entirely unfun dynamic  
My group ran pretty differently - we started with a mindfulness medication thing before moving onto sharing our results of trying skills, with one person talking and the rest listening,  then a slideshow of the new skills to learn and ending with a homework assignment to try the new skill we learned about that week. I didn't enjoy it much but I'm also hyper-individualistic.   


It would have been good if the therapist hadn't decided I wasn't paying enough attention one session and called me to read something out loud in front of everyone - which was fine. I read it perfectly, knew exactly what she was doing, but the material was really triggering at the end so I ended up in tears. And I never trusted her after that, because that kind of fuckery is what school teachers do to trip up neurodivergent kids all the time (and it's demoralizing as fuck.) Not trusting your therapist is definitely gonna reduce or even eliminate the potential good DBT can do because now you're learning skills from an untrusted source. Therapists mean well for folks who work with a primarily ND population, they can be terribly inept at handling us.   


I'm having a slower time of it, but learning DBT on my own is just what feels best for me (I can't afford an individual therapist - I could barely afford group therapy.)"	0010011010110100111	reply	na	na	na	0.9995161294937134	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Nope, you're not missing anything; this is how DBT starts! Statistically, your skills don't kick in until 6 months in, though obviously some people pick them up quicker, and others slower. 

If you've learned the skills, I recommend focusing on STOP and mindfulness. Those two will help you recognize when you're getting revved up and to be mindful of the emotions before they completely take over you. 

In the meantime, just try to learn the skills as best you can, and practice them as often as you can. I promise it works once you get the hang of using them on time! 

Sending loving kindness, and best of luck on your DBT journey :)

Edit: also just realized you're working through it on your own--that may also be part of why it feels ineffective so far; DBT effectiveness is really only scientifically/statistically backed up when you're in a DBT program.

"That's the rub! You've got to make a point of using the skills when you're not in crisis (some work well whenever, some more when things are headed downhill but not yet a crisis) to shore them up, then they come a lot easier when you really need them.

"This part sucks.  I hope you’re doing okay.  It’s totally normal for you to not be recalling strategies ‘on time’, as it were 

I started learning to do it through identifying the easiest skills to assimilate, as a commenter above as posted.  STOP and participate were the ones for me.  Mindfulness helps, but I have ADHD so it’s kinda hard to implement lol 

When I realised I wasn’t managing to activate my skills in the moments they were needed, I’d reflect after: what happened? what skill could I have used? how might that have affected the outcome? And I’d write it down

Doesn’t have to be super detailed, but if you get into the habit of identifying when you could have used things retrospectively, it starts to finally click in the moment 

I’m still learning too, & I’ve got a long way to go. But choosing a specific skills or two to concentrate on for the time being, and reflecting on those moments you might have used your skills for but couldn’t is such a bridge to turning the ‘might have’ into a ‘did’ and the ‘couldn’t’ into a ‘yes I can’

Journal your victories as well as you learn!! You can look back at the progress you’ve made.  It’s very fulfilling when you realise you’re making steps!!

"> DBT effectiveness is really only scientifically/statistically backed up when you're in a DBT program.

Does this tell us anything other than that these are the settings where DBT has been researched in?"	Throwawayfor_advicee	reply	na	na	na	0.9983515739440918	no	no	strong	na	dbtselfhelp
"Sort of; studies *have* confirmed that there's a higher risk of failure the more components you take away from the program, e.g. if the program isn't the recommended 6 month minimum, if you don't have an individual therapist and only do group, or vice versa, etc. DBT is actually pretty finicky and very quickly has the effectiveness rates of normal CBT (or lower, esp if, for example, the program is too short--this makes sense because a 6 week program is really 12 sessions and obviously 6 months of CBT would be more effective to the average patient at that point) if the particular recommended parameters aren't met. So we know that effectiveness plummets without relatively ""intensive care"" i.e. two certified therapists treating you and monitoring your progress, which is why DBT programs are so expensive/inaccessible a lot of the time--it's designed to be a *very* high quality program in the grand scheme of the mental health industry, and that makes it time consuming and expensive. 

Our assumption based on these studies is that going about it alone is pretty much useless because the rate of success is already pretty low without all parameters met. There are technically no studies proving an abysmal success rate; it's just an assumption because of 1) the abysmal success rate of any person undertaking *any* treatment by themselves, and 2) the rapidly plummeting trend in effectiveness when you don't meet all DBT parameters. 

If you'd like to see the backup for this data/are scientifically minded, there are a two major meta analyses of DBT clinical trials in English; the authors and years are escaping me but I can give you the info! Unfortunately it's under paywall but if you have access through your job (e.g. most pharma companies/hospitals/biotech companies/universities/think tanks/etc give employees some amount of access to academic studies related to their field), you'll be able to see the granular data and judge the quality of the studies for yourself. If you happen to know German, DBT is weirdly big in the German clinical psych world and I know there's also some excellent studies done there, but unfortunately my German is nonexistent, so I have no idea what they've concluded! But if that's a skill of yours, I definitely encourage poking around the German sphere to see how their studies compare to the (usually American) ones. 

Hope this helps! Sorry for the info dump, I love this kind of stuff, haha. Let me know if you need the names/years; I definitely have it around somewhere!"	Throwawayfor_advicee	reply	na	na	na	0.9983515739440918	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Thank you for your response! Yes, it would be cool if you could post the references to the meta studies you mention. I should be able to access them if they are normal scientific journals. I do have a decent knowledge of German, but surely the German researchers publish in English, too?

Anyway, I totally agree that the OP doing it on their own is probably a factor in their struggles. Also, it kind of makes sense that if some elements of a therapy program are dropped, this will have a negative effect on the success rates.

However, on an individual level, there is a wide variety of factors involved in healing. Some therapy modalities are backed by current scientific research, while some others not so much, yet they seem to be working quite well for many people.

I'm fairly new to DBT but I have a lot of experience on therapy. LOL! To me, DBT seems ultimately a set of skills and attitudes to be learnt and practiced. (Not entirely sure what the addressing trauma part of DBT entails.) Some people are suicidal and emotionally highly volatile. It makes sense to offer a very structured program for them. But at the same time I feel there is danger in saying that if one cannot do it the way it is designed to do, it will not be helpful.

Matters of the mind are tricky. I go to therapy, and I think it has been really, really helpful for me. I can observe a lot of progress in my thinking and in my life. Yet, the therapy modality my therapist practices is definitely not statistically or scientifically backed. Does this take away my perceived progress?"

"I've recently started DBT after being hospitalised and finding other types of therapy unhelpful for me. So far I've found the skills to be very common sense based and a lot of which I do implement already, but what I am finding difficult is that when I can tell I'm being sucked down into the depths, I lose all want to be better. Even at my best I really am only willing to put in the effort for other people and slightly because I myself want to feel better. And so when im actively heading downwards all willingness goes out the window pretty quick.

I know being willing is pretty much the entire point of DBT with mindfulness, accepting reality, and not being willful. So I'm really struggling to know what I'm supposed to do when I'm so far from wanting to implement skills or do even the smallest ammount of effort to help myself. Its not even that I'm feeling undeserving or anything like that, it's fully because it feels like way too much work, and I'm tried of trying all the time. I'd much rather give up on myself and give into the shitty though processes, behaviors, and urges. Even though I know it obviously wouldn't do me or anyone else any good that doesn't matter. The ultimate goal is to die anyway (when I'm doing bad and am very not willing to help myself). 

So I'm seriously struggling right now to have any want to make anything better or okayish. All that's giving me even the slightest bit of willingness is not wanting to emotionally hurt other people by giving into everything, and by all means that's keeping me going, but only so much and for only so long. 

I know that I have to be willing in order for anything to change, but I'm kinda stuck on this step. And it's kind of annoying how easily I can use the skills and understand them, but because I'm barely willing to want things to be different even when I do utilise them it barely helps this pit in my soul."	pstnothingtoseehere	post	7.5442616455851965	female	White	0.9988859295845032	na	na	na	3	dbtselfhelp
"Have you tried pros and cons? Sometimes pros and cons helps me ""turn the mind"" towards willingness. I don't have to feel particularly motivated or enthusiastic about turning the mind/ moving towards effective behaviour, but having the specific cons in mind (not just ""I'll make things worse"", but specific examples of likely negative consequences) can sway me.

For example, I really don't want to go inpatient again. So if I'm resisting using skills, I can say to myself ""if I refuse to use skills, I might have another serious episode and have to go inpatient again"". If that's not enough to get me to be like ""yeah okay"" I can list the things I don't like about inpatient, e.g. ""not being able to charge my phone when I want"", ""Not being able to take long walks outside"", ""Having to deal with unpleasant staff"", ""unpredictable environment is stressful for me"", ""loud noises"", ""boring"", ""not being able to have access to my shaving stuff"", ""being away from my cat"" etc etc."	pstnothingtoseehere	reply	na	na	na	0.9988859295845032	no	strong	strong	na	dbtselfhelp

This one's kinda a weird one that I got from the DBT book. You might already know it, but I'm sure someone reading this doesn't. It's called side to side movements.  All you have to do is move your eyes side to side rather quickly and it eases distress and anxiety in your brain and body. You can even do it with your eyes closed. Somehow, when I do it, it grounds me within seconds, even if it only lasts half a minute. It's a great way to ground yourself and relax yourself extremely quickly. Kinda feels weird at first but it really works! I usually only do it for a few seconds but thirty seconds is the ideal amount of time.

"Withdrawal is a hell of a thing; I'm sorry that that is contributing to this experience. It's very mindful of you to keep eyes on habits you are working to change even when you are distressed. That's pretty hard to do and I'm proud of you for it.

This isn't a DBT skill, but something I've learned in conjunction with that. Take a moment to be Kind to yourself.

Are there any other things that are a mental safe space for you? I typically rewatch Scrubs when I'm out of it - there's sad episodes, sure but there is a familiar comfort there too, a long with the laughs.

I trust you to continue to self regulate regarding the overeating and vaping, but allow yourself a little comfort where you'd be comfortable having it. TV shows, video games, books, walking en plaine air, Yoga, etc.

Put another way, you have already made today a non-Zero day. You've been mindful, you are seeking aid and comfort because you feel you need it - I know it may feel like everything is terrible and bleak, but I  these moments there is such great value in the little things. The easy accomplishments that make the machines of our lives turn.

I got out of bed today. I ate healthy food today. I took a shower. I didn't break anything. I haven't screamed at anyone. I watered my garden today. There is value in these things. All the Big Stuff we do in our lives would be impossible without the basic maintenance routines we perform day after day.

Eta: my little book there does include allowing yourself to be bored, to give into positive daydreams just because you can. I don't have a link, but I recall a peer reviewed paper discussing how media these days prevents boredom in people, and that lack of boredom - those moments when you just stop and think about random things - is extremely unhealthy."	throwaway_e8624	reply	na	na	na	0.9993502497673035	strong	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

I tend to think really far ahead and that leads to hopelessness, so I’m trying to combat that with a more rational thought like “I can’t control the future, but I can control the present, so what can I do right now to feel better?” That’s when distraction techniques come in, and they don’t always work completely or make the discomfort disappear, but they help in the moment. 

My favorite distraction is hiking. There’s nothing more calming then walking in the wilderness for a few hours, but that’s not always everyone’s thing. 

I would say to keep trying and using distractions and activities to keep you occupied. You’re already taking steps in the right direction, so you should be proud of yourself! 

What you said about being uncomfortable but not in distress hit home for me. I feel that a lot, so you’re not alone.

"Just a reminder that bad days happen. Sometimes, there’s no specific reason we can pinpoint. It could be withdrawal. It could be you’ve done too much and are just worn out. Or it’s just a bad day. 

If you want to drill down on it, you can try the root cause analysis. It sounds like you’ve been trying opposite action and it’s not really helping, so maybe just take a break today. 

Honestly, American society is weird in pushing nonstop productivity on people. It’s unrealistic and damaging to be that way. Rest and downtime is vitally important to our physical and mental well-being. Taking a day to just be a blob on the couch watching trash TV is perfectly fine.

"I've been in similar spots. 

From what you are saying (dopamine) maybe your brain wants you to self soothe? I think of it as taking care of myself when I have a cold - getting into bed, chicken soup, TV reruns or daytime talk shows, naps, etc. When I can't manage the feelings, at least I can make myself as comfortable as possible. And that sets me up to practice  the ""mindful of emotions"" skill. 

I practice this all with good emotions, too. Otherwise, my mind associates the skill with only bad stuff and just thinking about the skill gives me a stomach ache. 

Whether or not it is DBT, I remind myself feelings happen for reasons. They exist. I feel them in my body. I can't deny them or lock them down. I can't win that fight. I can only work with them.

Having routines helps. That doesn't help in the moment, but maybe in the future. A routine helps me go through the motions almost on autopilot. Along the way sometimes I catch motivation and sometimes I don't. The routine keeps me moving regardless. Since I have been motivated in the routine before, my mind can switch on motivation.

I have been doing DBT for a few months now. I mainly decided to start after having enough of constantly having episodes after being abandoned by my fp. I thought I was doing well, was using emotion regulation more and being mindful. I thought the idea of them moving on wouldn't bother me anymore until I saw that they had posted on Instagram and the person I suspected my fp would move on with (they had become very friendly at work etc) had commented on it. I instantly burst into tears and got incredibly upset. I feel like an idiot now and like I've made no progress	flipfloppoohbear	post	10.991362028634132	male	White	0.9994851350784302	na	na	na	7	dbtselfhelp
"First, I want to validate your feelings of frustration; it's really awful to feel abandoned and left behind, so it totally makes sense that this would make you dysregulated! I do want to gently point out that thinking you'll never get upset is black and white thinking; the goal of DBT isn't to prevent feeling upset (which is inevitable), but to give you the tools to modulate your emotions more effectively. People still feel their emotions to the red zone after therapy--it's just human nature!--but the goal is to give you the tools to a) not use your unhealthy mechanisms and b) calm down more quickly. 

If you managed to calm down instead of (for example) contacting your fp and melting down at them, that's the kind of progress DBT applauds and aims toward. If you're still struggling to implement skills, it usually takes 6+ months for DBT skills to kick in, so I bet you'll be a lot more consistent in a few months :) I didn't feel like I had ""mastered"" DBT until about 2 years into my program.

"Think not of the once where learning DBT skills didn't work.

Think of all of the times they did work. The small times. The frequent times.

Used to be I could stub my toe first thing in the morning and then my day is fucked. And if that sounds like hyperbole to anyone here, well, you're already here so you probably know that feeling.

There are frequent times where I feel I've not made any progress. Where the weight of the world bows my back and I don't think I can take anymore.

"There’s this pervasive belief that DBT is supposed to help you feel better, that it will make difficult situations easy, etc. 

And that is so very wrong. 

DBT is about learning skills and effective coping strategies so you can manage yourself and your life in the most effective way possible. “Effective” doesn’t mean happy or problem-free or free of sadness. It means you handled yourself and/or the situation in a way that didn’t make the situation worse and that led to an effective resolution. 

In this case, your feelings are completely valid and it’s not only ok to feel them, you NEED to feel them. Part of mindfulness and emotional regulation skills involve sitting with uncomfortable emotions and letting yourself feel them without judgment. 

Also remember that DBT is not a sprint, it’s a lifelong marathon of practicing skills to help you lead a life worth living. In fact, it’s recommended you do two rounds of DBT. This is because the first time through, you’ve usually started in crisis mode and everything is new. The skills may feel weird or understanding of them may not sink all the way in. 

The second time, you’ve gained enough mastery of the skills that you (hopefully) are not in crisis mode, and can more effectively focus on honing the skills and incorporating them fully into your life. 

And some people even do more rounds of DBT. Some do refresher rounds when they feel they need it.

A few months in? Be proud of yourself that you’re on the journey to better mental health. Give yourself grace—you are learning new things, and it’s going to take time. 

You haven’t failed anything. You’re grieving a loss and that’s a perfectly valid and natural thing to experience ❤️❤️❤️

"To me, progress isn't managing my emotions. It's learning to live with them productively. I actually visualize it as living with them. Sometimes they are intense and demand I listen to them. I don't turn my back, but I sit down to openly listen. I sob. I laugh until I pee a little.  I pay full undivided attention to them, where I feel them in my body, what thoughts bubble up. I reassure myself that I don't always feel this way. So if I experience my emotion fully, it won't be for forever. 

DBT doesn't relieve me of my pain. It's always there. But I can train it and work with it. A TIP skill can give me a great break and an opening to practice something else like ACCEPTS (for me usually an activity off my health-happy list). The point is the practice. Over time the emotion prompts the practice. My mind gets into a routine. 

It's okay if this skills don't work every time, especially in a new situation. I have great cooking skills, but sometimes the meal I make tastes like crap. Usually, it's because it is a new recipe or a new ingredient - a new situation. Or all of a sudden my family shows up and expects me to cook...very stressful and unexpected. That doesn't mean I'm not a good cook. My skills are still solid. After some practice in these situations, I know how to use my skills to deal with new recipes. I'm less likely to make crap. I get used to people popping in. I ask them too, even. It gives me practice using my cooking skills under pressure. I'm less likely to make crap. 

I don't think any of us completely get over someone. It sounds like you were coping ahead, which is awesome. Sometimes that skill doesn't work in one instance. It will work in another. And it sounds like you were trying to practice ""mindful emotion"" which is great!

I am currently in the process of feeling rejected by someone who is leaving me on delivered for extended periods of time. I have used TIPP to calm myself down and am now trying to use some opposite action. However, I am unsure as to how to go about this. I know the overarching emotion I feel is sadness but more specifically its rejection. So should I be doing something that makes me feel the opposite of rejection in particular? Or just do something that makes me happy? Also are there any ideas for what i could do?	flipfloppoohbear	post	12.407266109728365	male	White	0.9975730776786804	na	na	na	5	dbtselfhelp
One key with opposite action is to notice this emotion, then urges (so what urges is feeling rejected causing), and then doing the opposite of those urges. For example, taking time away from the phone, or if urges are to isolate then reaching out to someone. If the urges are to lay in bed, get out of bed. That kind of thing.	flipfloppoohbear	reply	na	na	na	0.9975730776786804	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
So the core part of feeling rejected is the intense bond you have with the other person, and the core urge in rejection is preserving the bond. So the opposite action is to create strong bonds with other people so that the rejection is less strong. I recommend investing in other friendships/relationships; there are also studies showing that people with lots of strong interpersonal relationships are more resilient for this reason.	flipfloppoohbear	reply	na	na	na	0.9975730776786804	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
I would suggest reading up on check the facts and combine what skills you can. Keep using distress tolerance as needed to keep calm but check facts and brainstorm ideas as to why the individual isn’t returning your text. List ideas and compose only facts. Like maybe they’re working or busy and can’t get to their phone immediately. Distract yourself from your phone with distraction skills as needed.	flipfloppoohbear	reply	na	na	na	0.9975730776786804	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
You've gotten some good advice so far. With regards to your request for suggestions for things to do that are opposite to your emotions/urges, I've found that focusing myself on my tasks and using OTAT (One Thing At A Time) can take my mind away from feeling down due to rejection because after having completed the thing, I end up feeling accomplished because I did \*something\* rather than nothing. Small, short physical tasks are good for this, like wiping down the kitchen counters or the dining table.	flipfloppoohbear	reply	na	na	na	0.9975730776786804	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
Coming back to add this. There’s a skill in the distress tolerance module called ACCEPTS where the E is changing your emotion. Sometimes opposite action gets interpreted as “make my emotion the opposite” when it’s more of a urges thing.	flipfloppoohbear	reply	na	na	na	0.9975730776786804	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
Hello. Recently a loved one cut me out of their life and I’ve been having a hard time with radical acceptance. Does anyone have any tips or advice they use to help them with it? Not sure how much information I can share here. Is there a daily mantra or thing you do that helps you? Just looking for ideas on better practicing it.

"Remember that radical acceptance doesn’t mean you’re ok with the situation. It means you accept the situation as it is, and then mindfully deal with it in a way that doesn’t make the situation worse and that is as effective as possible. 

For instance, I don’t like that Canada is having wildfires and the smoke is negatively affecting people I love who live near the area. But I accept that the situation is happening, and then proceed mindfully for dealing with it. I can’t control the fires or the smoke; I can only control how I respond to it. 


To proceed mindfully in the example situation, I would stay in touch with my loved ones to stay up to date on their circumstances and well-being. I would stay informed by watching the news, weather, and air quality reports.  Since I live a good distance away from the area, I can offer my home as a safe refuge should my loved ones need to evacuate for any reason. 

If I didn’t use radical acceptance in that situation, I would maybe have a meltdown, cry and worry nonstop, be miserable and otherwise be unable to function because in my mind, the situation SHOULDN’T be happening and I have no control over it. I wouldn’t be able to get past the fact that I feel it isn’t fair and shouldn’t be happening, which would paralyze me and keep me from acting in an effective manner. 

This doesn’t mean you don’t have feelings about the situation. Wildfires are unpleasant and scary and dangerous and life-threatening. It’s perfectly natural to be anxious, worried, concerned, etc. about the situation and valid to feel those feelings. Radical acceptance helps you to focus on what you CAN control, which is handling the situation is the most effective manner possible. 

TL;DR: Radical acceptance is about handling situations in the most effective manner you can by accepting situations as they are, and not being paralyzed by what you feel the situations should be."	AndreaIcebreeze	reply	na	na	na	0.9937081336975098	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

I have to use entertaining dialectical exercises to work toward radical acceptance. For example, I imagine a TV episode where the characters live out my situation and practice radical acceptance. The world I choose is always something epic or funny. A Tarantino movie, some Adult Swim cartoon, a high fantasy series, etc.  I watch several different episodes from several shows. Sometimes the characters and roles change. I don't put in too much oversight. Over time this practice helps me understand the dialect of my own radical acceptance. I'm not explaining this well maybe...	AndreaIcebreeze	reply	na	na	na	0.9937081336975098	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I found a lot of help through going through the worksheet and then reminding myself of what I had discovered from it. 

One of the things that has helped me the most on it was when it said to describe the situation I need to radically accept and write it down. And then look at that and rewrite it to take out the judgements and things that are not facts.

I didn't realize how many judgements and things I believed (but weren't proven or even could be) blocked me from accepting this as it was. 

There is much more to my story but in short I thought my dad's new wife (post my mother's death) was terrible and weird. And then by removing the judgements, I realized that I just don't know her. I live 2,000 miles away and neither one of us had made any effort.

When she does something that I need to accept, I remind myself that I don't know her so I cannot judge her actions beyond what the actions are. We can never truly know what people are thinking but I REALLY don't know what she is because I don't know her. 

That's the closest thing I have to a mantra but it really helps me recenter."	AndreaIcebreeze	reply	na	na	na	0.9937081336975098	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

Something I find helpful from dbt is tracking your emotions & sleep & substance use each day (like check in and mark off how you feel three times a day or something to see what correlated with what - like is your mood better in the evenings, or around meal time, or when you’re with specific people?). You can do this on your own pretty easily and it helps you to make tiny habit changes in your life in the meantime. This link: https://dbtselfhelp.com/dbt-skills-list/miscellaneous/diary-cards/?amp is to a diary card where you can track things a bit, and it lists skills from the dbt workbook (which you can find online).

"I play a lot of board games. When I started DBT in January I asked, “what’s the overall goal?” And that seemed like a hard question for my group to wrap their head around. I thought it would be an interesting practice for me to try and answer that, knowing what I know now, and with the hope that it will help someone else. 

The goal of DBT is to gain a set of skills, that utilize semi-Buddhist breathing exercises, and stoic philosophies, to help broaden your window of tolerance over time."	AutoModerator	reply	na	na	na	0.0013599207159131765	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Been stressed with my therapist out of town & some other issues piling up lately. Not much I can do about most of these things right now, except practice patience and wait! Which is very difficult for me lol and brings up a lot of emotions, especially because it’s mostly some things that I have no control over & can’t change immediately. 

So I’ve been using the IMPROVE skills lately to help me get through it. Really liking Imagery, Prayer, and taking a little Vacation in my mind. I’ve been imagining this beach that I went to back in the wintertime, which is when the waves get big here. Even though I’m stuck at home today, it helps me feel into how soothing & amazing it was to watch these waves roll in that day. I’ve been trying to feel in my mind how the cool breeze felt on my skin, my toes in the sand, the smell of the salty air, the bright sunlight bouncing off the waves. It’s literally calming me down just thinking about it again now to write this out lmao 🌊🌞

"Hi! Firstly it’s a really positive step that you’re going to join a DBT group - well done for taking that step. I also want to validate you and say that it’s completely understandable that you feel nervous. I think most people trying DBT for the first time feel at least a little nervous. It’s a big thing!

In terms of understanding the concepts, I won’t lie - there are a lot of new concepts and skills to wrap your head around at first. But most aren’t too complex in my opinion. The group facilitators are there to support you. If you’re struggling to understand something, ask questions or ask for examples for more clarification.

In terms of home practice, again the group facilitators are there to support you. If you’re having problems completing the home practice, reach out to them for support. In my personal experience, home practice hasn’t been too overwhelming. On bad weeks, I haven’t been able to do it but you’ll never get in trouble for that.

By going your are already getting better. Stick with this, and don't be afraid to tell your group leaders when you feel overwhelmed and begin to doubt the program and whether you should continue or not. Do continue. Sometimes all you can do is put sweat pants on and just force yourself to group, but you'd be surprised how much you'll learn from osmosis, just simply being around people using nonjudgmental language, people who can work through conflict without losing emotional control, etc. Give yourself space to have maladaptive behaviors, to experience self-doubt, and/or to feel anger toward others in your group. That is ALL apart of the experience. The professionals expect it, and are 100% prepared to help you find perspective on your own. You are a human being, which means I believe you can do this.

"As the title said has any of you overcome fear of pain by radical acceptance or any other way of thinking? 

Im slowly trying to overcome my fear of giving birth but I have hospital and physically painful trauma from childhood that prevents me from even taking a needle without creating a a scene which can be embarrassing as a 27 year old.

I’d suggest learning more about radical acceptance and the strategies behind it. It’s helpful in so many situations. With that said, having gone through child birth, anything you learn or any planning will go right out the window. The pain is deep and intense but at the same time you’ll suddenly be able to hyper focus. If the pain is too much and you need an epidural? The fear of the needle will suddenly be nonexistent! Whatever happens and whatever decisions you make will be the right one. Trust yourself. You’ve got this! Also - congrats!!!	PrizeDue9847	reply	na	na	na	0.9848035573959351	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
I honestly don't think that radical acceptance is the way to go here. Pain is stimulus + fear, and the fear is the problem here, not the stimulus.	PrizeDue9847	reply	na	na	na	0.9848035573959351	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Radical acceptance is more of a distress tolerance skill, as in an immediate crisis (SO just dumped you, lost your job, etc.). What might help here is checking the facts. 

1. Do shots hurt? Yes. 
2. Do they hurt forever? No. 
3. Does the benefit of the shot outweigh the pain of the shot? It sounds like in your case, the answer is yes. 

Now, you need to use cope-ahead skills. 
1. Can you talk to your doctor and therapist about ways to mitigate the pain? There are relaxation techniques, anti-anxiety needs, etc. that could all prove to be very helpful. 
2. Plan what you will do to prepare for the situation. For instance, if you’re going for bloodwork. Before you go, figure out what relaxation techniques you’ll use (meditation, fidget toys, etc.)
3. Will it help to have someone with you? If so, ask someone to accompany you. 
4. Advise the lab that you are neurodivergent and require some accommodations to successfully get your blood drawn, like a friend in the room, lowered lights, the fidget toy, whatever. 
5. Think about what the worst thing that could happen if you get a shot. In most cases, the worst thing is pain and bruising. What can you do if that happens?

   -You can talk to the phlebotomist about your concerns. 
   -You can ask them to stop at any time during the procedure. 
   -You can ice the bruise when you get home. 

If you’re more concerned about the phobia reaction side of it, you need to work with your therapist/psych on calming techniques and possibly pre-appointment anti-anxiety needs to help you get through the procedure. 

I hope this helps ❤️

Today i woke up in tension and decided to sit down and write things down, i am grateful for. Instantly better.

Few years ago those tenchniques (meditation, bodyscan, gratefullness, goal and purpose, and more..) were Part of an anxiety cbt Program. And those helped me so well! But you know as the time goes i got tired of doing it all and got passive, stopped doing the practices. 

In DBT they are even more helpful practices, like validating your own emotions, radical acceptance as far i read.

"Opposite action is doing the opposite of what the emotion is telling you to do. Depression and sadness often cause a person to isolate. It may also cause a person to work really hard to prevent a loss.

Sadness tells us we are experiencing loss generally speaking. Depression may be more severe though.

I would say pick an opposite action that is really simple and easy and try to get some dopamine from that and try to snowball.

"That is a difficult spot to be in. That's great that you already know DBT skills, even though your health at the moment means that it will likely take more energy and effort than usual to apply them.

Your brain is kind of refusing to make the chemicals that motivate you to do things, but you need to do things in order to generate those chemicals. So it's a bit like there's this huge rusty cog inside you grinding slowly in the wrong direction, making it harder and harder to do stuff.

So you need to find ways to trick yourself to do things that will override the malfunction and turn the cog in the other direction. For me it was picking any of the pleasant activities on the pleasant activities list and using opposite action to force myself to do it. You might not  be able to enjoy it, that's not the point. Don't pressure yourself to enjoy it. Just doing it is an achievement and a powerful shove against that stupid cog, it will start to change the dynamics of things a bit, and the next time you do a pleasant activity, you give yourself a better chance of getting a positive feeling out of it.

Then the more times you repeat that, the more cooperative your brain will start to be in giving you motivation to do other things that will make the whole process easier, like the PLEASE skills about looking after your physical health.

I think a lot of the distress tolerance skills are really applicable as well for moments in a depression hole. So you might make kind of chains of skills, like 1) Cold water on the face -> 2) Opposite action to -> 3) Listen to your favourite album from when you were a teenager.

If you have an internal monologue about how DBT makes sense but you don't deserve it, I found loving kindness meditations a kind of step-by-step way to use my empathy for other people as a doorway in to empathy for myself, or even at a kind of logic like 'All human beings deserve decent treatment, I'm a human being, therefore I deserve decent treatment.'"

"I have BPD and ADHD and am doing DBT based therapy 1:1 with a psychologist.

I also have 3 youngish children. 
Something i really struggle with is the overwhelm associated with parenting children. A lot of this is ADHD related, I don’t seem to have the executive function to hold things in my brain the way other parents do, and this causes me to spiral. 

My children are also neuro-diverse which adds an extra layer of difficulty as they don’t have age- appropriate skills that would make life easier for all of us.

Which DBT skills would be useful in this situation?

"Do you have an executive function coach by any chance? 

I'll say that I'm not a parent, so perhaps take what I say with a grain of salt. I worked as a teacher in the past, though, and know exactly how difficult it is to wrangle a group of kids (even in a structured environment like a classroom, never mind home!), so I will say I empathize with your struggles. I hope you can see that even by asking this question, you're being a good mom ❤️ I'm sure your kids are very lucky to have you, and feel very cared for. 

My special education hat suspects that the ""overwhelm"" you feel is probably specifically an organization issue within the larger realm of executive disfunction. Do you ever feel like there's so much to do that a)you can't even grasp what exactly is everything you have to do and b)even if you have an idea, you just don't even know where to begin? Those are all organization issues, and a coach will teach you how to keep tabs on your running to do lists, how to prioritize, how to keep track of time, etc etc. 

There's also what I personally call, ""the ADHD shame spiral."" In my experience working with ADHD kids (and usually the ADHD parent of the ADHD kid), I think people with ADHD can often sort of--latch onto their emotions and their turbo engine minds run with it because there are no brakes to stop it. I'm less sure of your treatment because I'm much more familiar with recommending ADHD treatment programs for kids than recommending a treatment program for a comorbid adult, but for ADHD, the shame spiral is a symptom of a primary disfunction of attention rather than of mood, so the treatment is actually (usually) medication first, then therapy to undo the trauma of failure so many kids with ADHD hold. 

Anyway, all that to say, I highly recommend an executive function coach for the ADHD because I think it'll actually make you feel in control enough to progress with DBT/therapy more effectively. 

In terms of DBT, though, I think your instincts for ABC PLEASE (especially PLEASE) is correct combined with distress tolerance. I would try to add a mindfulness exercise even for 10 minutes a day. I would also look at problem solving if you have the brain space, though I really strongly believe that problem solving will come naturally once you have a coach to keep you more organized. 

Finally, I'll just add that raising neuro-diverse children is very, very hard, so don't worry about how well the other parents are doing--you've got a monumentally more difficult task! If you can, I'd see if you can get them into a school with a really strong special education department--the good ones won't necessarily put them in the spEd classes unless they need it, but just provide them with an education specialist who can provide them with some more support/give them coping strategies so that you have a little less on your plate. 

Hope any/all of this helps! Best of luck ❤️ Sending loving kindness!"	Tricky-Disaster-2911	reply	na	na	na	0.9966448545455933	no	strong	strong	na	dbtselfhelp

"For me it depends on what it is that I am radically accepting. 

Sometimes I can still feel pretty crappy about, or even really upset or overwhelmed by, the situation - but have more of an open-mindedness & willingness towards doing what is needed. Sometimes it actually allows me to truly feel sad, like when radically accepting something tragic that happened to me in the past. 

Sometimes it helps me to feel courageous, or able to be more vulnerable with my support system, or even just the tiniest bit more compassionate towards myself & whatever it is that I’m going through. Other times it feels like a huge sigh of relief, a weight off my shoulders, a sense of clarity or renewed strength, and sometimes even a peacefulness washing over me. 

Sometimes I can feel it shifting within the small things, once I have been successful at using this skill & really accepted the reality of something that just needed to be acknowledged & *accepted* - like my day steadily getting better or turning itself around without much effort, being present enough in my actual experience to notice the sunset, the clouds, the full moon, etc. 

Hope this all makes some sort of sense, lol. :)"	ARenewedSecondChance	reply	na	na	na	0.9763808250427246	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Radical acceptance has nothing to do with feeling better. Rather, it means you accept the situation for what it is, and not what you believe it should be. 

For instance, you get an unusually high utility bill. Instead of raging and/or crying and/or panicking and/or absolutely melting down over it—which does nothing to help solve the situation—you accept that the situation is what it is and mindfully proceed. 

In this case, you’d feel shock and confusion, and acknowledge that the high bill is unsettling to you and makes you nervous about your finances, all very valid feelings to have. Then, you’d move forward to deal with it—call the utility company, check for leaks/faulty wiring/etc. that could be the cause, and so on. Then you’d work with the utility company to either get the bill forgiven or reduced, and/or work out a payment plan. 

In that second example, accepting the situation results in less stress and a better outcome than having a complete meltdown. It doesn’t mean you’re happy or feel better—an unusually high bill is never a fun situation—but effectively dealing with it means you’re ensuring the problem isn’t worsened by your actions. 

TL;DR: Radical acceptance has zero to do with feeling better, and everything to do with effectively dealing with reality. This helps ensure you don’t make the situation worse for yourself, and instead end up with the best (not “happy”, but “effective”) outcome you can achieve."

I think of being willful as the feeling of clenching my first so tight that it hurts, or like a fly thrashing in a spider's web and just getting more and more stuck.

For me it feels like a kind of release or loosening of tension, a kind of softness. Often after practising it, I feel a little bit empty, but not in a distressing way.

In future maybe you could try saying ‘let me think about it and get back to you’. It’s a really valuable thing knowing you do not have to make most decisions on the spot. If you really can’t do it, maybe look at the skills around interpersonal effectiveness - DEAR MAN and GIVE FAST. if you can, write out a pros and cons both FOR doing it and for NOT doing it.

You don’t have to have a reason to not want to do something. “Because I don’t want to” is valid enough in and of itself.

I wanted to let you know now so you have enough time to [make other arrangements, adjustments, etc.]

If they ask why, you can always say “I have another commitment.” That’s not a lie—you have a commitment to YOURSELF.

"Context is good. You’re definitely not over sharing. DBT is helpful for all sorts of things. 

My main point is that the number one thing you can do for yourself is to get back to ideal body weight. EDs generally lead to malnutrition that cause a lot of the issues: an underweight brain, moodiness and irritability, difficulty sleeping, attention issues, and my personal favorite - the human body isn’t meant to throw up so often so using these involuntary reflexes voluntarily can lead to the inability to throw up ever again. 

The eating recovery center had a great group for family members. It was shocking to know that my ex needed to get to ideal body weight and then stay there for over a year before she could look in the mirror and recognize herself. That’s the most powerful thing I learned. That and how excruciatingly hard it is for people with EDs to recover. You’ve got this!

"I did a partial hospitalization day program, 5 days a week, 9 am-3 pm. I did it in the summer after my first year of college, so I didn’t have to quit anything, just didn’t have a job or internship that summer. There may be “intensive outpatient programs” available that are less time-intensive than partial hospitalization. “Normal” DBT is also pretty good — an hour and a half or two hours of group a week, plus individual therapy once a week. If you don’t need to learn all of DBT super urgently and have life commitments like a job that you want to keep, you could do the normal DBT stuff… idk really depends on where you’re at and idk. There can be value in “staying in your life,” especially because you can apply skills more relevantly, but there can also be value in doing more intensive treatment, especially if you are not in a safe environment at home, would find it beneficial to pause daily life activities, etc. so it really depends. 

Financially — paid out of pocket, got bill, filed a claim with health insurance, was reimbursed partially 

Told my friends that I was doing a program for my mental health because I had ptsd 

My family knew because we had family therapy 

Didn’t really tell others 

It was alright. It was definitely ~a lot~. Kinda overwhelming and stressful sometimes. But it was soooo helpful. I made some really good friends, too. I’m overall very glad I did it.

"Hi. I'm new to DBT - finished two modules so far. A few days ago I had a big emotional trigger. My target behaviour/negative coping mechanisms are maladaptive dreaming, binge eating and oversleeping. Instead of doing any of those, I tried to sit with the feelings (for 10 minutes), and then tried to do some self-soothing methods (read affirmations, cried, tried to imagine my therapist's voice saying 'it's ok, it's ok). I then tried to do IMPROVE, and decided to go for a walk despite feeling extremely sad/depressed and not wanting to do anything.

&#x200B;

I managed to walk for 1 mile, all the while feeling intense anxiety/sadness/like something is 'wrong'. I tried to use STOP a few times, but the feelings did not decrease. I also tried to do mindfullness, and tried to notice plants, the sky, but I was too distressed to be mindful. I had planned a 5 mile walk but ended up walking back, so I managed a 2 mile walk.

&#x200B;

Because of all this, I felt like ""I already tried my very best to use skills, WHY am I not even feeling even a little better?"". In fact I honestly felt even worse. Had I just stayed home and resigned to one of my unhealthy coping behaviours, I would 'at least feel better for a few moments' (but feel worse in the long run). This makes me feel like I don't trust the skills, like they're useless for me at times and makes me feel demotivated. Can anyone relate/give any advice?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Was majorly triggered, tried to use STOP, Feel the feelings, self-sooth, IMPROVE, mindfulness. None worked, in fact having tried my best to use skills and failing to feel any better made me frustrated and demotivated/don't trust DBT skills.

"One of the biggest misconceptions about distress tolerance is that it makes you feel better. This is untrue; the point of distress tolerance is to keep yourself from using your unhealthy coping mechanisms until you can access wise mind. It doesn't matter if you feel better, it more matters that you can keep worse behaviors at bay, and then you can use Emotion Regulation skills to feel better. It's a very common complaint that distress tolerance doesn't work! Once you approach it with the mindset that it's basically keeping your mind/hands busy rather than actively improving your mood, I think you may find more success with them.  

Also, DBT takes about 6 months to fully kick in, and it starts out with a lot of failures to implement the skills fully, so you're not alone!

"No skill in the world can make you feel better. No person including any of us can make you feel better either, because you are trying to force something if you are trying to ""make"" anything ""good"" happen. Radical Acceptance of your emotion, of your thoughts, of yourself, of your past, the future you are headed toward if things do not change, and most of all the present are needed first. 

You are looking at your feelings like they are problems to solve, not rational responses to events that have occurred in your life up to this point. There is truth in this cause and effect relationship that your mind lacks understanding of and ultimately, compassion. Listen to what your feelings are telling you and separate them from your thoughts, which create judgments of your situation, making things worse.

Because look at you, you are so capable! You have all these tools at your disposal and you are actually using them! You clearly want to get better. You clearly want the pain to stop. But are you giving yourself credit for how powerful you are becoming, or the skills/DBT? Because it was you the whole time. It is you who are going to get through this, one way or another. Accepting yourself with grace and forgiveness may just be the missing piece of the puzzle. Remember, you are *not* the same person you were when the trauma happened. You are someone stronger.

But you are allowed to be weak, to be fragile, to hurt, and to suffer. You are only human, after all.

For a deeper perspective, you might want to look into the philosophy of Buddhism and Daoism, which DBT owe a huge debt to."	nadnurul	reply	na	na	na	0.9985265731811523	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"As others have said, when it’s really extreme emotions— TIPP is my go-to. TIPP is designed to activate your body’s parasympathetic nervous system to help calm down. I specifically like the temperature one utilizing the dive reflex for fast results.

That said, I often don’t “feel better” when I use distress tolerance skills, just calmer. I was taught that their purpose is to calm you down quickly in a crisis to avoid making the situation worse, so you can approach it later when you aren’t as triggered/angry/upset/destructive etc.

I’m sorry that the skills are not helping you. I think it’s great that you are trying and cycling through many skills in a moment of high emotional arousal— that’s really hard work and is something to be proud of."	nadnurul	reply	na	na	na	0.9985265731811523	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
Hey I relate this to this so much!! I saw a tiktok last night that gave me an aha moment. Basically the tiktok was talking about how you have to find activities that calm you and take you out of your head that works for you. She talked about how she tried things like going for a walk or exercising, which is traditional advice for helping with anxiety. She said her therapist told her to find things that work for her and pull her out of her head. When I really thought about it walking does not do that for me.. I am over analyzing when I walk. But dancing to music, swimming (especially at the beach), going for drives listening to my favorite music on scenic routes really help me get out of my head. So maybe try that.. think of an activity that you can do that pulls you out of your head!	nadnurul	reply	na	na	na	0.9985265731811523	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I fully relate to this. I went through 3 rounds of a DBT skills group. Several of the skills just never worked for me if I was highly stressed, frustrated, angry, or any other highly charged emotion.

The TIPP skill has been the MOST helpful for me though, especially if coupled with distraction. I suffer from migraines and have a cold head compress thing I got for that, but it is effective at shocking me out of an emotionally charged state more than anything else. It doesn't work 100% every time, unfortunately, but even 20% relief can be helpful.

All that being said, I believe that when the skills do not work for me, that my episode was not triggered by my BPD. I have the wonderful comorbidities of ADHD, MDD and general anxiety disorder, coupled with self-diagnosed autism.

"DBT is not about feeling better. DBT is about effectively handling the situation, acting in a manner that doesn’t harm you or make the situation worse. 

For example (hypothetical situation): A coworker is promoted over you. You feel like you’ve been doing more than them and have really been busting your butt for that promotion, and you feel like they don’t deserve it. 

You could:

a. Lose it and cuss out your boss, resulting in you getting fired;

b. Go to the bathroom and cry nonstop for a couple hours, resulting in your boss and coworkers wondering about your emotional stability and ability to do your job—which ultimately would result in even less of a chance of getting promoted in the future; or

c. Use radical acceptance to accept you didn’t get the promotion, allow yourself to grieve that, and allow yourself to feel the anger AND check the facts (for instance, do you really know every single thing your coworker did that maybe resulted in them getting the promotion? Probably not. You really can’t objectively say you were the better choice.) Then, you’d plot the most effective path forward. In this case, ask for feedback from your boss on what skills you need to learn or improve in order to better your chances of getting that promotion next time, and work on them.

This was exactly my experience on Sunday after some big vulnerabilities and triggers. I don’t know if I can give much advice but I can certainly relate and want to send so much love and solidarity to you. Fwiw, things have eased as the week has gone on and I’ve continued to try and use skills. I have also found that sometimes when I feel like my skills aren’t working, I try and remind myself, even out loud, that I am working and trying so hard. That helps me with mindfulness of the current moment and self compassion. Also want to echo what others (and my therapist) have said— distress tolerance doesn’t necessarily eliminate distress, but it helps us survive and tolerate it.

When I’m at 5/5 emotion, I tend to cycle through all the TIPP skills, spending a few minutes doing each. That will bring me down to a 3-4/5 of the emotion and I can think a bit more about doing something like distract or self-soothe to lower that emotion even more.

"It's great you're self aware and can foresee this outcome. Have you tried creating a cope ahead plan? Imagine the worst case scenarios and be radically honest about your triggers and how reactions will show up, and how you will address them.

Your wise mind most likely already knows it wouldn't prove anything to anyone if you are self destructive. 

Truth is: you don't need the program. The system is not abandoning you, as it doesn't abandon anyone. In fact, to be discharged you have to be trusted enough to meet the criteria for discharge.

Show up for yourself. 

The harsh truth is everyone on this earth, at the end of the day, just has themselves to rely on. It can be lonely at times but it's in our design to function alone AND with community. We need both. But we don't always have access to community. Especially when suffering with disorders and diseases people don't know how to help, or be around. 

We can't expect the world to provide, or people to show up. To try to manipulate others with ""look what you made me do!"" for one, never works, and secondly, just creates more chaos and problems. It's the emotion mind grabbing hold. TIPP. Find community like these. Find group chats and YouTube videos. Continue the journey. 

We decide at the end of the day if we parent ourselves and make the next right decision. We keep ourselves safe. And as we heal, we make those lasting healthy friendships and relationships.

"When one can’t afford therapy how does one know they’re really toxic?
All I’ve got is my own worries and struggles over it. I fear I might be controlling. I fear that maybe I just don’t care enough about other people and their feelings. 
I feel like I can be really toxic sometimes and other times I feel like I just deserve more. 
My boyfriend does a lot for me practically wise. His love language really is acts of service 100%. But I need more in terms of words and quality time than acts of service.
I feel like I deserve more of this or that from my partner so I try to talk. Talking does nothing. Toxic me comes in and says something bitter. 
That makes me create some space to focus on myself and my hobbies. Trying to do all the exercises to trick my mind into being happy or content. Trying to convince myself to be better.  
After that I try to talk more calmly but end up in an argument. Where I come to find I’m acting toxic again by taking the argument too far. 
Cry it out. Seek out to mend the problem. Have deep discussions mostly me talking. Repeat.
I feel like I make up issues and try to solve them myself. Only am I truly making up issues or are they there? 
Is it normal to be the only one talking when you need to have a discussion? 
Discussing marriage when these issue’s haven’t been solved seems silly sometimes. I feel lonely a lot of times yet I also feel like I’m overreacting often.

"DBT doesn’t really have the concepts of “toxic” or “deserving” because they tend to be unhelpful judgements. So I would advise letting go of those and trying to be more specific. What are the facts? What do you observe? What emotion(s) are you feeling? What is the emotion trying to tell you that you need? What is your boyfriend feeling, what does he need?

Learning the mindset behind Non-Violent Communication pushed me even further in terms of applying an informed consent model to my needs that helped me understand why manipulative behaviors are toxic.

"I'm curious if anyone here has experience with DBT applied to food aversion? I know DBT can be used in the treatment of eating disorders, but my situation is a little different. Basically, my anxiety has always wrecked my appetite (thanks a lot, gut-brain connection!) and now that I've had about three straight years of really intense anxiety, my relationship with food is contentious, to say the least. 

I recognize that I'm hungry but I don't want to eat because eating triggers a conditioned stress response - lots of physical tightening sensations and judgments/interpretations like, ""if I eat this I'll feel stressed and cry or feel nauseated,"" or ""omg this is so hard, why is this so hard, this is so unfair,"" and the all-time classic, ""this is so easy for other people, I suck!""  I know a lot of my work will be with releasing those, for sure.

Of course if I put off eating, then I'm hungrier and less able to handle the anxiety, eating feels harder, and so goes the cycle. I've found some mostly effective ways to get a few reasonable meals & snacks daily, and some days are better than others. Still, it's a lot of struggle to experience multiple times a day, without an option to take a break from the exposure. Plus, it sucks that one of my PLEASE skills is a pain point, that makes other ones harder! Like getting exercise makes me hungrier and I'll need to eat *more* food, gah!

I'm still pretty new to my DBT program and I'm fortunate to be working with both group and an individual therapist, but I know I've only scratched the surface. If anyone has experienced anything like this with DBT, I would really appreciate hearing about it, it's always nice to hear from others."	annefordp	post	28.209616768776804	female	White	0.9723978638648987	na	na	na	3	dbtselfhelp
"I have food aversion with anxiety too. For me the biggest DBT skill is radical acceptance. I had to fully, completely accept that I didn't want to eat and that I needed to anyway. So I could feel like not eating and choose to care for my body anyway, but in a way that worked for me. So then I accepted that ""any calorie is a good calorie,"" meaning that if the only thing that appealed to me was, for example, cheese curls, the options weren't eat cheese curls or eat a vegetable, they were eat a cheese curl or don't eat, and I was better off having the cheese curls. For me, drinking was easier than chewing, so I also drank a TON of my meals, either straight up ensure or some kind of a tasty smoothie. 

DBT wise, I also found the skills like emotional regulation and urge surfing to help me ride out the negative feelings around food and then come back to it. I had a lot of weird myths about food and eating and how I ""had"" to ""eat right,"" so the DBT worksheets on emotion myths and dealing with those helped me a lot."	annefordp	reply	na	na	na	0.9723978638648987	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

Any advice regarding what to do about this?"	flipfloppoohbear	post	31.821762422702896	female	White	0.9986836314201355	na	na	na	2	dbtselfhelp
"I’ve totally experienced this and I’ve been using DBT skills for nearly eight years. It takes time. 

The biggest thing that helped me is figuring out my systems/plans for distress tolerance skills when I’m emotionally regulated and calm. I try to “scaffold” my space to make using skills easy (ie, there are always multiple ice packs in the freezer, I keep my exercise stuff in a highly visible spot, I keep puzzles and fidget toys next to the couch etc). Part of this was having a conversation with my partner when we were both calm and getting along about how taking time outs and walks helps me calm down. 

It took a lot of trial and error and tweaking things that didn’t work to find the right systems for me. It didn’t come naturally at first. One day I was in crisis— I actually remembered to use one of the TIPP skills and just gave it a try. Afterwards, I started to figure out what skills resonated and started to slowly build systems to make doing them easier. This process took years and is still ongoing. 

Since you are newer to it— maybe you should put the acronyms in a visible spot like on the fridge? Does your group have a pager system? If it does, maybe try one skill with a low barrier to entry (like an ice pack) and if it doesn’t work— page them! The team member can suggest some skills or possibly guide you in trying a new one."	flipfloppoohbear	reply	na	na	na	0.9986836314201355	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
This is called a skills breakdown point and it’s a very tricky thing to deal with. My best advice is to catch it early with emo reg- obviously easier said than done lol. Also, maybe do behavior/chain analyses to help with catching it earlier.	flipfloppoohbear	reply	na	na	na	0.9986836314201355	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Hello, I've taken up meditation and mindfulness. I have an uneasy mind so I'd mindfully walk. I am currently listening to Allan Watts' audiobook 'Out of Your Mind', just love the sound of his voice and his British accent. I am a bit reluctant to dive deep into meditation because I tried that countless times before and it would always bring me lots of anxiety and hypochondria. I will stay away from body scans, which seem to be the main trigger.

The question is... Should I do affirmations to radically accept the fact that I am no fun to be around? It's okay to be me and be alone, that's the way it is. I feel like I am more at ease feeling my emotions and am not trying to escape them. I am certainly getting better at it with age, I'd let my emotions get to me and ride my emotional roller coaster from start to finish and, yeah, it seems like I can live through them just fine. I no longer resort to any bad behaviors which would do me more harm than good in the long run. No junk food, no alcohol, no reckless sex... I've completely isolated myself. 

I am trying to come to terms with living alone. I have no friends and if someone stays around for a longer while I'd push them away. I have a very bad phone addiction and every day I'd open up my Messenger/WhatsApp/etc.apps to check if there are no new messages. I've been meditating for the past few days and feel like my need to pick up the phone every couple of minutes and check those apps has significantly diminished. I have BPD and so throughout the years (I am 30 now) I've isolated myself and now barely ever go out. I used to have acquaintances but I either blocked them or they gave up on me. People will take advantage of me and I don't want that. It wasn't as bad back in university. At work, in cubicles with no private space whatsoever, we get to spend way too much time with each other and so all my coworkers ended up hating me very profoundly. I got things sorted out for me and with the help of my psychiatrist, I am now working full time from home. My psychiatrist wrote a note indicating it's best I work remotely due to my current mental condition. I feel unhappy either way. Other people drive me crazy but on some days I kind of want to socialize a little. Having no social connections, I will die at an early age, but I still have to live my life."

"Since this is a dbt sub, i’m going to start from that perspective. Mindfulness comes with both what and how skills. Great job on the what, but the nonjudgmental, one-mindfully, and effectively skills aren’t apparent in your practice as written.

Non-judgmental - “no fun to be around” - while i also cope with self-deprecating humor, that’s a little hard to read and seems to be the basis of your whole understanding here. Have you tried observing and describing exactly what behaviors might make it hard for you to socialize? Gathering some compassionate external feedback? Everyone has things that suck about them, you are not especially bad, promise.

Effectively - While a solo meditative practice is great for some things, it’s not effective as an all-purpose. There’s the participate skill that might be another arrow in your quiver - what about participating in some social activities outside of work or home? Sometimes i like to participate in new social scenes so if it goes terribly, i never have to see them again. Volunteering can be a good one for that.

And the one-mindfully, seems like you’ve picked up on the phone tethering you to these behaviors and now might want to problem solve that. My approach has often been to temporarily delete those apps or assign times where i go phone-less (sunday nights i put on music and put it down for just an hour or so).

There are a few assumptions in dbt that we do take on, and i notice that patients don’t always get the full education in the philosophical foundation here. We call it the generous assumption: everyone is doing the best they can right now and we all need to do better. Sounds like you’re doing the best you can with the struggles you have right now, imperfectly, and you want to do better. That’s all we have to accept today, nothing permanent or forever alone."

"I don't know what you should do. If you don't feel well enough to include other people in your life right now, I think that's okay. 

But isn't Radical Acceptance about accepting things you cannot change? I think you *could* reach a point in your recovery where you are able to have stable meaningful relationships. 

I've been there before. Right now I feel I'm regressing and pushing people away and pulling away myself, but I don't think this is a permanent thing. It's kind of like Riding the Wave. Right now I'm headed towards isolation, and maybe I'll spend a bit of time there, and then maybe I'll start socializing more and get back in touch and have some intimacy again.

I guess you could Radically Accept that *for the moment, due to your mental state,* you are abstaining from friendships.

I can tell that I would need to really buckle down and spend a ton of time doing this work in order for it to help.

I can't get myself to do it though. I thought a group would help but it's just not. "	Evening_Attention_45	post	-2.6363266814040998	female	White	0.9995105266571045	na	na	na	8	dbtselfhelp

Put another way, if you're not being taught the skills by someone in the know, then how can you verify you are implementing them correctly?

I will say that it takes time to practice and sink in as with anything you try to learn or do - just like building muscle. If you go to the gym to change your body, it won't happen over night. 

Its been trial and error for me, picking tons of different things to figure out what works and everyone is different. Its not as simple as practice xyz. 

I think the main issue for anyone seeking DBT skills is shame, that's the core component to anything emotionally challenging and if you can master how you reframe and relate to shame - you can handle anything.

"Hi All,

I feel disappointed with my DBT therapist. I've been seeing here for half a year now. She is good with coaching calls, she correctly identifies the DBT skills I need and the worksheets to use, however, there is no depth. I don't think she conceptualizes her cases and I noticed she does not have very good knowledge of attachment issues and relational trauma. For example, I got triggered about something she did in therapy and I felt unsafe and mistrustful. We talked about it, I told her the skills I used and that I still couldn't reduced the intensity of the emotional trigger. She then suggested maybe I should try using ice and then she was asking me if maybe this is related to my family. I said of course it is. She was asking me some obvious questions and I said ""You tell me about it!"" I really felt like that is her job.

I am really feeling disappointed. She is OK when it comes to the DBT skills but nothing beyond that. I don't think she can make a connection between things, and she does not see patterns. It's pretty flat. Perhaps it's because she is new to DBT maybe only a year.

I used to have a very good psychologist who knew things without even me telling him. He is very expensive though and only private pay.

Last week, I saw an EMDR therapist that specializes in attachment and complex trauma. I did not have to fill intake papers and no intake session. I went to her office and withing 15 minutes she already made some very insightful observations and even helped me with some EMDR processing. That night, I cried because I felt seen and understood after a long time.

Now, I don't know what to do with my DBT therapist. Should I try to tell her I am disappointed with therapy? Should, I try working on the relationship, although, I cannot teach her about attachment trauma? Should, I just quit DTB therapy and go with the EMDR therapist?

"Hey there,
I see that you've made multiple posts about various disconnects with your DBT therapist. At this point, I think it's clear she's not a great fit for you. 

People need different types of therapy at different times. I was in DBT for a total of 4 years, but now I'm in something different. If you found something more effective for you at this time, that's totally valid. I think this sub is full of people whose lives were changed by DBT, so we're fanatics. But **every** form of therapy has its limitations. 

Your case is even more difficult because the therapist isn't a great fit. 

If you really want to continue with DBT, I suggest finding a different therapist. Otherwise, it sounds like you've got some other options that may suit you better. 

Best of luck on your path to healing :)"	nikolajanevski	reply	na	na	na	0.9994902610778809	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Each form of therapy is very different by design. I see a therapist who *does* DBT but practices a different form of therapy with me. I also go to a DBT group which plays out more like a class on DBT materials. I can still talk to my individual therapist about the DBT skills in our one on one sessions but the purpose of our individual sessions is not wholly DBT. 
      
I would reevaluate what brought you to DBT in the first place (the Values Skill). 
      
If you’re looking to work on Trauma or if Trauma is holding you back, DBT might not be best suited for your needs; right now. 
     
Any decent therapist is going to tell you that the goal of trauma therapy is to work through the trauma to the point where your triggers don’t cause you to shutdown (dissociate). And eventually to be able to no longer be triggered. But that goal is different than the DBT goal. Which is to be able to deal with any adversity using the Dialectic and be able to move forward from a “wise mind” place. 
      
You should absolutely talk to your therapist about your misgivings. They should be able to work with you to figure out what the best course of action is.

Edit: 
One more thing to remember is that pop-psychology like triggers and attachement is not nearly the whole of psychology; and the importance of those ideas are way overblown in media (particularly social media). Just because you’re aware of these things does not mean that they are widely accepted or addressed in the same way that you might have been presented by the media. 
For example, I have ADHD. On social media, there is a lot of talk about RSD (Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria) in those with ADHD. But when I brought it up to my therapist, he personally agreed it was a phenomenon but he pointed out to me that there isn’t enough research to support it, it isn’t included in the DSM, and there are no specific treatments for that symptom/phenomena. He did hear me and suggested we tackle it using other skills and tools that relate to that."	nikolajanevski	reply	na	na	na	0.9994902610778809	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

""Hi Therapist,  
I've given this a lot of thought and I've decided to stop therapy with you. We can have one more session on Monday as a closure.  
I've found the DBT skills I've learned so far have been useful and I practice them. I am grateful for that. The coaching calls have been useful as well. However, I have noticed that you don't have much knowledge of attachment/relationship trauma and I already found a therapist that has a very strong knowledge in this area and is a really good fit for me. She does EMDR combined with the internal family system as well as DBT.  
There also have been minor disruptions or misses in our relationship that have lowered my interest and motivation. For example last week or the week before you asked me if I drink. I said no, I've been sober and you were surprised. This was the 4th or 5th time this has happened. I disclosed this in the intake forms and during the intake session.  
Again, I think you are knowledgeable of the DBT skills and identifying the correct skills I need to use. Also, your coaching calls are a strength too.  
Even me taking the step to stop therapy is a result of me doing the opposite action. My habitual response would be to stay in therapy although I am not quite satisfied. The opposite action is stop therapy and find a therapist that is a better fit.

Yes we did have a final session and she actually thanked me for the feedback. I also provided some constructive feedback like she needs to work on remembering relevant information about a client.

"I’m in a group. I love it. 
We meet every week and go through a skill a week. It’s approximately 10 months long. There is roughly 9 of us and a facilitator/therapist, most of us started at the same time, As it was a new group but a couple people have left and a couple have joined. We are almost though the material. Once we have completed a cycle, we will be given the option to stay for another cycle or finish group. There are a couple people in the group who have done multiple cycles, which seems to bring more insight to them and the group."

I just started last week. It's weekly, for an hour, with about 6 of us and 2 facilitators, and it's in person.  We seem to be doing one worksheet or handout each session.

"My DBT group had two facilitators (who were also therapists) and experts in DBT. We followed the Linehan workbook and it was circular, meaning anyone could drop in no matter where we were at in the workbook, they just had to start at the beginning of the module. We did the mindfulness module in between all the other modules. So say we just finished up a module and Distress Tolerance is next. Before that, we’d do a week with the mindfulness module, then start Distress tolerance. 

Group was 4-8 people at a time. We would start with a mindfulness exercise, do a quick check in, go over the previous week’s homework, and then go over the material we were learning for that week, and got homework to do. 

You could graduate after one complete DBT cycle, or do another one (which is recommended). After the second one, you graduate from DBT and have the option of joining the graduate group, which focuses on more advanced techniques but is also very unstructured, so if the group decides to take that time to shipper a member having a hard time, we can. 

I’ve had to pause graduate group because of life stuff, but I’ll be going back as soon as I can. It was an amazing experience and literally has changed my life."	Legitimate_Yak1462	reply	na	na	na	0.0057646771892905235	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"I loved my group! 

My DBT group was 2 hours every week (and I had individual 1-hour sessions with my counsellor weekly) for a full year. This was a research study, so we had the after hours pager system available as well. 

We went through all modules twice (I believe mindfulness was covered 4 times). The sessions started with a grounding exercise, followed by sharing our homework from the previous week, and the second hour was all about teaching skills and doing various exercises. My group had pretty high participation/engagement levels and it was open enrolment, so everyone started and graduated at different times. I prefer this model because people further along can really help the newbies acclimate. 

I initially didn’t want to participate in group but I ended up preferring it over the individual sessions. I made two friends in my group who I became close with and still talk to regularly. We keep each other accountable and still reference the skills all the time."	Legitimate_Yak1462	reply	na	na	na	0.0057646771892905235	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Something that also helped with my boundaries was writing down an event or lack of boundary. How I felt when I made the decision, doing the decision and how I felt after.

Example: committing to an event with a situation or person I have a hard time with. Maybe my stomach was in knots or I was already second guessing myself. When it came to the event, I’d be thinking of excuses out of it…feeling nervous, cranky, tired, or wanting to drink. After: drained, upset or angry.

I would look back and start to see a pattern… maybe some stuff I had to do and deal with, but maybe some things pointed toward a boundary I needed to define. I reminded myself that a boundary can be fluid: I stopped talking to a family member over the phone for a time so I could sort out some personal stuff. I eventually was able to adjust that boundary to limiting our interactions.

"This week, I started doing DBT group therapy at the request of the mental health professional who did my mental health evaluation recently. Apparently I have several co-occurring disorders that all can be treated with DBT, and so I was referred to a six-month program where we'll be working out of a workbook that I saw on Amazon a bunch of times while looking for workbooks. It's called ""DBT Skills Training"" by Marsha M. Linehan.

It was only my first week this week, but already, I think I'm going to enjoy being in this therapy group. During our group, we talked about the emotion mind, the rational mind, and the wise mind. We also talked about problem-solving by looking at the facts of a situation that triggers us and working towards more functional solutions. It was a nice refresher of a class for me to go to, and I appreciated that I was able to make it to the class.

Normally when I am in group therapy classes like this, I tend to feel like a ""know-it-all"" because of how many times I've heard this same advice told to me or read about it in the past. That's my biggest weakness, in my opinion, because it closes my ears and mind from truly absorbing the information that I need to hear from the updated viewpoint of myself TODAY rather than the me of yesterday. But I'm working on it. I think that the trick for me is to attend the classes and pretend that I've never heard of these tips before. In doing that, I'm more receptive to the information that is sent my way."	Junel_Fe	post	40.30443590261173	female	White	0.0011240236926823854	na	na	na	1	dbtselfhelp

"I don’t have the exact names of the skills but I do have long term results: I’m over a year and a half post DBT. I find my self SHOCKED at the decisions I make and how I interact with others. It keeps getting easier and better and I’m more proud day by day.

Contradictory over share 😜: I have a family member that I over shared with (it ultimately became a really unhealthy boundary-less mess). I saw her again recently and had a similar interaction as what I’d been part of for years. I kept my mouth shut. Trust me, I was fuming inside and wanted to go down the deep hole of an argument that would ultimately go nowhere and make me look unhinged. Luckily I was on my way out of event and was able to make a getaway.

The next day, my default was to feel bad and rabbit hole me me me. BUT I had the mind to realize 1) she acted inappropriately (saying something that would clearly hurt me) 2) wrong place (a party my daughter and I were invited to as her guest…we didn’t know anyone else)  3) wrong time (we were literally walking out the door saying goodbye to all and in the middle of the crowd).

I thought, wow did she act like a jerk. And then I realized it wasn’t about me being awful or…really anything to do with me at all. It was her.

If you had told me 5 years ago I’d be absolutely ok during and after that situation, I’d have said you were crazy.

Did it hurt still? Yep! Was I insecure and sad? Yep! But just fine. Feeling normal feelings but not overreacting and not assuming it’s all about me and needing to defend or over explain. I love the power of silence I’ve learned.

Not everyone I speak to is a close enough friend to share everything with. I WISH they were, or that I had more close friends to talk to, but I need to have appropriate boundaries for my sake and theirs.

"Hi all. I have been with my wife for 9 years and we have in the last 6 months been separated due to our mental health and our having 2 toddlers. Together it’s a toxic mess between us. Part of this seems to be due to the different approaches professionals have taken with us individually. I’ve been on the DBT train since then (loving it), but I’ve noticed she has become more of a black-and-white mindset. I don’t know if this is because of her therapy or my awareness of it. My struggle is that we both still seem to want the relationship, but it makes it difficult for me to be involved with her (and my kids) due to this mindset. We talked briefly about how we seemed to be getting taught the opposite kinds of therapy a few months back. It’s made things around parenting extremely difficult. I’ve tried to take the judgemental “absolutes” or concepts that she wants from me and look for the skills that apply to that concept. (e.g. accountability = Fast). This still has made things difficult for us to repair our relationship and work together for our kids. For example, she applies past situations as if they are consistently happening in the present, and will happen again in the future.

Please forgive me if this question is unclear, but has anyone else had this relationship dynamic with someone? How do you work with someone who has such an absolute view of the world when going through a change of the opposite?"	tucktuck101	post	41.414765252459006	male	White	0.9968400001525879	na	na	na	5	dbtselfhelp
"Can you give us a concrete example of how her black-and-white thinking and your different approach manifest?

To me, it seems there is still quite a lot of projection involved, you thinking that your problems are caused by your wife or that the change is dependent on her changing. Surely the dbt principles of radical acceptance and nonjudgment can be applied to how she acts or the direction she is going. Not trying to excuse her bad behavior here, simply trying to look for a way forward. Take care!"	tucktuck101	reply	na	na	na	0.9968400001525879	no	no	strong	na	dbtselfhelp
" One is saying that I have to be accountable for picking up and spending time with my kids *every* Saturday. When I shared this, my current pointed out how accountability is a judgement of the future, like blame is a judgment of the past. Especially when the reasons I haven’t have been relating to cataplexy and other narcolepsy symptoms aren’t under control that Saturday. 

On the topic of projecting… I don’t think I am? I’m definitely curious how you got that vibe that my change is dependent on her. There is a struggle to change when she is a predominant relationship and we both have toddlers, both want to still be active parents etc. 

I’ve had some pretty difficult conversations which has lead her to make a formal complaint about my threatment plan. There has been times where she has prevented or criticised me from using Stop, distract, tip, excersises on dbt coach under threat of me not seeing my kids or being able to talk to her again (she responds to distress by trying to control the situation, which she has vaguely(in the way she doesn’t want to) admitted to doing so in the past. So I’m definitely not perfect when it comes to using the emotional regulation module but I don’t tend to act or look at things in a black and white way. I’ve been told a couple times now by health professionals “you seem to be thinking of her needs more than your own” when discussing situations…. I know I am capable of falling into that mindset. I’ve spent months trying to catch myself to only catch myself after the fact. When she isn’t part of a situation, I find a lot of the problematic thinking/behaviour/emotion driven urges are virtually non existent 🤔


Hope some of this background info gives a little more context but I’m definitely interested how you think I am projecting. It would help me a find a way to prevent it and “solve a few puzzles” that are holding up my progress in therapy."	tucktuck101	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9968400001525879	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Sorry for a slowish reply! I'm on holiday and a bit off grid.

I don't know why you are doing dbt but a lot of us are because of bpd or similar struggles. At least for me it is very challenging to keep boundaries but at the same time trying to radically accept that another person still are what they are, while at the same time sort of lacking a clear sense of who I am in the first place.

Anyway, by projecting I don't mean anything heinous, just something at least I tend to do all the time. Black-and-white thinking is very typical for bpd, but for some reason you place a lot of emphasis on the black-and-white thinking of your spouse instead of that of your own. In reality, you can access and change only one of them.

But in a way projection can be seen as a good thing and many of us bpd folks are certainly good at it. Projection lets you identify things in yourself because you see them in others.

I kind of liked this one:

When she isn’t part of a situation, I find a lot of the problematic thinking/behaviour/emotion driven urges are virtually non existent

To me, this kind of describes the heart of bpd, at least for us somewaht functional: it is the close interpersonal relationships or even just the presence of another person that sort of brings stuff up. But I guess you could view this as a blessing, too, or at least say yes to it."	tucktuck101	reply	na	na	na	0.9968400001525879	strong	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
Oh and when relating some “judgemental concepts” back to dbt, virtually everything points back to a ratio of >75%give + <25% fast. If I prioritise fast over give, the interaction is ineffective. I.e it was a contradiction to her that I would not pick up my kids from daycare and drop them off, but I would if I got to spend time with them after doing their bedtime routine. I had already told her that day I was busy, and was free the next day.	tucktuck101	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9968400001525879	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"All good, life carries on outside social media 🙂

Honestly I’m doing dbt(mostly self lead) because cbt failed and I have emotional regulation issues. I don’t have a diagnosis for bpd yet but I relate to it in a variety of ways.  a psychiatrist I spoke to thrice last year mentioned it and recommended dbt (free healthcare has its downsides). 

I didn’t expect anything heinous 🙂 I genuinely value anyone’s ideas right now. I was asking how you saw me projecting as I couldn’t see it in the moment. But i understand the commonness of it being a thing and how easy it is to do 😮‍💨

I guess the question I should rephrase is:

when you’re aware of your own black and white thinking, how do you navigate situations when you’re seeing warnings from previous experiences that you might have to engage in that mindset so you can achieve an interpersonal goal?

So, the title is brief - I know that existing solely in wise mind is just as likely as standing still in a windstorm; there's always some give and take because life is complicated.

However, besides memorization and practice, is there anything else that y'all do to assist yourselves in conducting your behavior in a healthy and progress-oriented fashion?

I am in the process of learning how Personal Boundaries work, and I know that discussions with people about my availability to them will go better for them and myself if I am speaking cool and calm and have my intentions in mind, but to be frank I'm actually really scared to take that step.

Time. The vast majority of decisions don’t need to be made, words don’t need to be said immediately no matter how urgent things feel in the moment. Call it artful procrastination. I’m the first person in work or life to say “it’ll happen when it happens.” For example, if I have an interpersonal conflict at work, I expect that conversation to straddle the next few conversations (boundary, apology, correction). If I have an urge, I plan to handle it tomorrow or next week, usually doesn’t come to fruition. I don’t expect things to change or people to improve overnight, always incrementally, and adjust myself accordingly.

"Hi. I’m looking for skills or literature that can help someone with borderline personality disorder to divorce someone.
Everything I find is more geared towards people being broken up with by someone with BPD. I am finding the whole process super distressing. I struggle with finding the confidence to go through with ending everything, I often romanticize the relationship only after I’ve made it clear that we are heading for a divorce. I’ve recently wanted to sleep with other men, but haven’t because I want to do this right this time. My whole life I’ve jumped from relationship to relationship, only able to leave one relationship once I’ve found someone suitable for my next. I don’t want to do that anymore. I am not happy in my current relationship and I haven’t been for a very long time, but find it so distressing to actually go through with a break up. There’s also that question in the back of my mind like “wait, are you sure you want to do this? What if you’re just acting on the unstable relationship part of BPD?” I have been crying for days, I don’t know what to do or how to do it. Please help point me in the right direction.

"First- I’m sorry you are going through this. Divorce was one of the hardest things I’ve ever gone through and mine was relatively simple. 

(This is just my personal advice- I’m not a lawyer or therapist or financial advisor. )

I know this isn’t a skill but I strongly suggest talking with a mental health professional you trust first. You will have a resource who can help you to navigate the overwhelming feelings and reactions that come with a divorce. 

It will be helpful to have a clear picture of why this relationship does or doesn’t work. I think this kind of effort is most successful when you have a neutral party helping. 

 Once you are confident in your choice. I would contact a financial advisor and a lawyer. I do not recommend trying to do this on your own.

"I am amazed with how well you put in words what is basically the same thing happening in my head lol. Although I do not have much of the anxiety anymore, the over analyzing, rationalizing and justifying my every action and etc is pretty much on point.

My way of dealing with this is basically this:

1. Identifying that you fell in the overthink trap and acknowledging. Is easy for me because of the over analyzing thing so I am aware that I've got myself in the ""think think train"" . When I do, I try telling myself like ""ok we are doing this again, lets try to do something else"". In my case it can be daydreaming or finding something else to entertain me.

2. Getting my mind busy. When I need to work I out on headphones, turn on some concentration friendly music or youtube documentary to be in the background while I focus on the task. Cant let my brain have time to wander, so doing this I cover all the bases.

3. Writing like you think. It helps organize the thoughts because in my head they are a dumpster fire. The result text probably have no real use but the action of putting in paper is great to process what my head could not.

Of course this is my case, but I hope it help give you some ideas.

I learned DBT from 2014- 2017, and then again with a different group in 2020. In 2014-217 I worked one on one with a therapist, and in 2020 I worked in a group (over zoom, it was Covid). Both times, I used the same workbook. In the workbook you, you go though with all different exercises to eliminate black and white thinking. The workbook introduce ideas like “wise mind,” “thinking in opposites,” “half smiling,” and a lot of other techniques. It gives ideas for moments of crisis (one technique I still use to de-escalate is splashing cold water on my face to activate the parasympathetic nervous system). There’s a lot of acronyms for basically techniques to get you out of black and white thinking, and for regulating emotions. It really helped me a lot, and I’m grateful I went through it. I eventually “tested out” or “cured” my bpd, and no longer identify with the diagnosis. I no longer self-harm, or deal with the mental health issues like I used to. DBT was a major factor in my road to recovery. I keep the workbook near my home desk and flip through it occasionally to keep the techniques in my mind. My therapists, both times, helped guide me through the workbook techniques, while guiding my personal journey. While technically possible to learn DBT on your own with just a workbook and online resources, having a professional guide me through the process was incredibly valuable and made the process far easier, stronger, more manageable, etc, etc.	ExaminationOwn2642	reply	na	na	na	0.011495104990899563	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"It's depends on where you are and if you go through a group. 

In the group I went through we did weekly sessions where we covered the previous weeks skills and how they felt to use for the past week, the current weeks skills and how to use them, did some exercises related to the current section. Then, there was one on one sessions with one of the therapists or psychologists (mine was a psychologist for the whole time I was in the group program)

In one on one therapy for me, it has been basically the same, but I only see mine once a month and we talk about how I made use of the skills I learnt in group as well as what skill I am currently doing as self study. Things like how effective they are and if I have questions about how they intended to work.

The DBT work book is broken into 4 sections: Mindfulness, Interpersonal Effectiveness, Emotional Regulation, and Distress Tolerance. Each section has skills that interrelate to one another. I can’t speak to what all practitioners do, but from what I’ve encountered, there is typically individual therapy and group therapy. The group therapy is like a class on the workbook, teaching the skills. You’re encouraged to work on these skills and topics with your therapist. We don’t talk about people’s diagnosis in our group however there is typically a mix of diagnoses and people there for various reasons: not just to work on BPD.

It’s not easy but it’s worth it. DBT has literally changed my life. But it won’t do it by itself. You have to put in the work and keep practicing the skills until they’re serving nature.

"Yes, it absolutely does help! I swear DBT is designed for autism, the way the skills are organised is very satisfying and helpful. As for pointers, just the same I’d give anyone doing DBT which is to try to find an individual counsellor who is properly trained and will do a full DBT program for you, not one who draws from different approaches. There’s a place for that, but not with DBT in my opinion, you’ve gotta do the whole thing properly. 

If you can’t find a therapist, try reading the manuals. There’s one specially for emotional dysregulation and it’s awesome, I can send it to you if you need. But the best place to start is distress tolerance in my opinion. Try Googling distress tolerance skills like self soothing and ACCEPTS and then choose one letter from the skill to practice each day when you’re feeling strong emotions. 

This is maybe not the best organised comment but I want to encourage you to pursue DBT because it has been so effective at helping with my black and white thinking from autism, the wise mind and middle path skills help so much.

One of the things that I've worked to Accept in the course of my therapy has been that I am only in control of myself alone, and no one else. Actions that I take or statements that I make can influence those around me into action that I may or may not expect, but nothing I do or say will *make* someone do anything at all, as they are in control of themselves alone and no other.

Fair enough I am new to this sub. I have found believing things are unraveling is way for me to cope with the discomfort of being powerless over others. I get stuck in my stinky thinking when things don't unravel how I had hoped and it places me in a terrible mental space where I cannot regulate and practicing my tools feels overwhelming. I have CPTSD and building my distress tolerance that feelings will end  feels really hard.	Hbesaw96	reply	na	na	na	0.9993810653686523	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
Just keep practicing the skills and mindfulness. It gets easier. But you might also want to address the PTSD in a different context than DBT. EMDR or other trauma therapies can be very helpful and make it easier to engage with the DBT material in a more meaningful way. I think it’s easy as a patient to only do 1 type of therapy, but doing multiple kinds of therapy can be huge.	Hbesaw96	reply	na	na	na	0.9993810653686523	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
I have been treated with EMDR and it helped. I also found the change triangle helpful, but I can't consistently use it. For me, after years of CBT, moving to a DbT model has been in the hope of more sustainable relief.	Hbesaw96	reply	na	na	na	0.9993810653686523	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
That’s great to hear. Just make sure you stay on top of your trauma symptoms. They can be sneaky and pop up when you’re doing the work, and DBT isn’t necessarily a trauma oriented practice; not that it can’t help with those as well.

"I’ve often used avoidance for things I don’t like to do, don’t feel like doing. I’ve placed my comfort over doing what is best for me.

I like that participating encourages you to fully experience the moment. I think it encourages you to volunteer to go on stage when they ask for a volunteer. Or be social and talk to people at party and really be into it when the situation calls from it.

In the long run this kinda thing is good for us, but my short term urges/feelings tell me to not do this stuff. Then I live a life of avoidance and fear. 

But by acknowledging the moment and choosing to partake fully in whatever is going on, we grow as people and become more confident, develop greater social skills in the long run, and let go of fear.

I really like that DBT just is relentless. I can appreciate that the time and effort that we put into it can and will pay off and that there’s no simple shortcuts for us to fundamentally change our lives. It’s not easy, but it’s necessary.

"So before I dive into this I do want to share that between my BPD diagnosis, on top of the ADHD and a few other issues my DBT experience is different.
Sorry this feels like a novel

What were the behavioral issues prior?

My worst behavioral issues actually were and still are tied to Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria. That being said, instead of shutting down, pushing people away, and trying to protect myself from the perceived threat of abandonment, I now can sit down and process through the use of DBT skills.

Did DBT stop any problematic behaviors?

Stop, no and its not meant to. This is more like heres ways to survive and as you use me more and more often it gets easier to use me.

Did DBT significianty help any issues, even if it’s not 100% solved? 

I still have what is called a BPD split ussualy caused by the Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria. However those splits are no longer constant, long lasting, or nearly as self destructive. They used to come every 3 to 4 months, last for weeks, full of self harming behavior, and land me almost alone. My actual spilt was a few months ago it lasted about 6 hours, I didn't lash out, start any fights, I basically skipped right to my breakdown stage and cried. I can say that was from actively trying to use my skills before I hit that point.

What stage/section  do you think has made the most difference? (Such as mindfulness, emotional regulation, distress tolerance, accepting reality)

As for what part made the most difference that's tricky because of the I find alot if the skills are best used together.

However these are my favorite skills and their section: 

Radical Acceptance (distress tolerance)

Dime Game (interpersonal effectiveness)

Dear Man/Fast/Give (interpersonal effectiveness)

Check the Facts (emotional regulation) 

Paired Muscle Relaxation (distress tolerance)

Distracting (distress tolerance)

Self soothing (distress tolerance)

Body Scan Meditation (distress tolerance, though I use it as more of a quick scan for physical reactions to an emotion)

Do you find that DBT can be a little cognitive overwhelming just because the amount of acronyms and content? 
 
Not really, though that may be tied to either me a) having a specail interest in psychology, or b) the self study I am still doing with the use of both the workbook and therapist manual.

Did you have any issues remembering to use it in the situation it was needed? 

Not remembering to use, but using. There's times where I'm like hey I need x skill, I can see what's coming and I don't want to be in the way but my Executive Disfunction doesn't let me. 
Best thing for me to compare it to is a train wreck I could stop but the lever doesn't work. However once it's past the point of no return I can quickly assess my situation and start using appropriate skills to prevent about 90% of the fallout.

Did the philosophy of DBT do anything for you, or did you prefer the skills more?

I cant say we really touched on much philosophy, or that I see much in the therapist manual. There's one thing I guess would be kind of philosophy that I learned while in the program. Our emotions are hard wired into us to support non verbal communication. I'd almost call them instinctual but that might be me making connections when there isn't any. I find the skills are key to reminding myself my experiences, feelings, and emotions are valid.


Are some of the seemingly silly exercises actually useful? 

Absolutely, they may seem silly but they are so useful. The dime game is my favorite example of that. It's a great way of processing what is ok to ask for or say no to and how much to stand your ground when doing so. 


How hard was it to convert DBT from a knowledge base to a skill set? 

That's tricky because im sure without my books I would be struggling alot more. Having access to the handouts and worksheets makes it so much easier for me to use the skills when I need them.

If you could do it over would you have done anything different the second time around?

Straight up I would have reported the therapist who was non accommodating to the girl who was in the group with ADHD to higher ups at the hospital where it was offered. This was before I had my ADHD diagnosis offically, which was confirmed 6 months after I finished the program.

In order to get dbt I have to pay for both group meetings and individual therapy. Both of them cost 2.500 rubs per sessions and it comes total to 15.000 rubs - 17.500 rubs per month. When translated into dollars it might seem cheap but you gotta keep in mind that the wages in Russia are pretty shit. Most common wage in my city is about 30.000-35.000 rubs per month.

What skills can you use to help with how you're feeling now? What do you need in this moment? Some distress tolerance skills? Some self validation of your emotions? Maybe doing a check the facts/ opposite action? Checking in with Wise Mind?

Acceptance. You are aware that it was something ‘minor’. Have you considered vulnerability factors leading up to your blow out? There often are things that slowly build up leading to less tolerance to things. It’s ok to validate and acknowledge emotions without validating the behaviour we want to change. Things will be up and down, skills might be right in the centre of your thoughts one day and not so much the next. There are a lot of skills to learn.

"Hi! I just started a DBT program last week (thank you to folks who encouraged me in my first post here) and I have a wise mind question, which was our first topic. 

I have a hard time trusting that I’ve found wise mind, especially with making decisions. My example is that I just had an appointment with my med provider and I choose one med change over another. I’m waiting for insurance approval on the one I chose, so I haven’t started yet.

I’m finding myself second guessing the decision and I feel like I want to do the other option instead. However, I’ve been feeling crummy with anxiety lately so I know my emotion mind would question whichever thing I chose. Meanwhile, reason mind is active, coming up with justifications to email my provider and change as well. I’ve been thinking on it for days so it’s not a snap decision.

Is it wise mind then to change over since both sides agree? Or are they egging each other on? It’s so hard to trust my own choices s after struggling with anxiety for so long.

"I did group for almost two years and every time we did Wise Mind the newbies would always ask ‘but how do I trust myself?!’ This is a really common response :) 

For using Wise Mind generally, it’ll take some time. Every time you use Wise Mind it’ll make your faith in it, and trust in yourself, a bit stronger. There’s no fast track there. 

Regarding your specific decision. I think the fact you’ve taken the time to think it over IS Wise Mind.

"Using the cope ahead skill helps a lot in these situations. Basically, you ask yourself what’s the worst thing that could happen as a result of your decision (realistically, no catastrophizing). Abbreviated example of the process is below:

Say you choose Med 1 over Med 2. Absolute worst thing that could reasonably be expected to occur as a result?

1. It doesn’t work for you. 
2. Has side effects you don’t want to deal with. 
3. Both. 

Ok, so what can you do if one or more of those above things occur?

1. Talk to your doctor about your concerns. 
2. Switch to Med 2 because Med 1 didn’t work out. 
3. Try a different combination of medications to see if there’s a way to make Med 1 work for you. 

Wise Mind doesn’t mean Right Answer. It means you have, as objectively as possible, examined all the facts and information you have (including your feelings in the situation), and then navigated a course of action that the examination shows may be the most effective choice in the given situation. 

So coping ahead is setting yourself up for success by examining potential results, and then putting a plan in place for how to deal with those results should they occur. In your case, you chose Med 1. If it works for you, great! If not, we’ve listed out three things you can do of it doesn’t work in order to bring about the most effective resolution for you. 

TL;DR: You trust Wise Mind by setting yourself up not for success, but for effective results using the Cope Ahead skill."	annefordp	reply	na	na	na	0.9884740710258484	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Have you ever heard of [Voltaire's quote, ""One must cultivate one's own garden""?](https://www.theschooloflife.com/article/cultivate-own-garden-voltaire/). Basically, it's this story of a peasant farmer who's reflecting on how corrupt politics is. He concludes his reflection by saying that all he can do is tend his little garden, which is the only thing he has control over, and the abundance of his crops gives him joy. The moral of the story is that yes, the outside world *is* unfair and so horrible that if you think about it, you'll inevitably feel sad, helpless, and angry. BUT you have your own garden (life/choices) that you DO have control over. Notice that the guy in the story is the lowest class of medieval/early modern society: he's a peasant. He is definitely suffering under structural/institutional injustices he can't change. But he acknowledges that there are also things he *can* control, and he uses them to create a joyful life. 

Voltaire's garden has been my mantra ever since I heard of it: it's a wonderful story of dialectics, radical acceptance, and the problem solving skills and loving kindness that one can experience from radical acceptance. Yes, I agree with you that there are things in the world that make me incredibly upset. For me, I was so bitter I flunked out of college twice before I graduated, meaning I graduated very late. I wished I had the neurotypical brain and trauma-less life that so many ""successful"" people around me had. But Voltaire's garden teaches us to focus on our garden--our own life--and look at the wonderful things we can produce if we focus on ourselves instead of wasting our energy being jealous of others. 

I think the primary skill the use here is radical acceptance, but I'd break them down to the following: 1) it's clear you're doing a lot of comparing between yourself and others, so I'd cut out the triggers that get you to do that. Comparison is the thief of joy. 2) Remember dialectics! The privileged people you're looking at probably don't have the perfect lives you imagine them to have--it just looks like it on the surface. I remember there was this one rich girl I looked down at in middle school. I learned later than she had been dealing with a really aggressive child cancer that required her to have multiple surgeries and left her permanently disabled. 3) This sounds cheesy, but I'd start a gratitude list. Part of the reason everything feels like a ""rat race"" is because you're not seeing what makes life worth it for you. Writing down your joys forces your brain to focus on them, and therefore reminds you of what things give you meaning in your life. Identifying what fulfills you can then inform your future choices so that you can make your life even more meaningful.

Radically tho you can’t change everything and make things fair, that’s where the acceptance piece comes into play. Trust me it’s a heck of a lot of practice. Willfulness vs willingness tho let’s talk this point. When your willful it can get you stuck. Willingness helps let go and accept. Again practice it take a lot out of ya. I know it because I was willful for years til I let the dbt skills sink in: and sometimes it just takes that moment of aha to realize why your learning the skills to begin with. Anyways . Looking up willingness skills and acceptance and maybe turning the mind skills to aid your way to helping you get un stuck, cheers and keep the practice going because I know it is hard but worth it and you got this	IanVM36	reply	na	na	na	0.9957347512245178	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

People who say ""life isn't fair"" are simply handing you a platitude because they don't want to take the time to understand you or your circumstances. People who say ""life isn't fair"" don't care about you. It's a lie. Life isn't anything. Life just is, and it just does. Fairness doesn't exist in manifest reality. It's not a particle I can find in the standard model, or in any classification system of science. We've never directly observed fairness in a lab. Anywhere. *Ever*. 


Fairness, or justice, is something we have to choose, actively. The universe does not create fairness. Only we can do this. Empathy is not automatic, but a choice. And the belief an enhanced understanding of the world by itself will necessarily lead to the betterment of it is one of mankind's oldest delusions. Fairness requires sacrifice. It requires enduring mutual tensions and discomfort in order to create lasting understanding and relationships that enrich us, instead of tear us down. It's a lot of work, and most people don't want to put the work in. 


You're angry because you're coming to terms with the reality that the majority of people don't feel the same way about all of this that you do. The reasons vary, sure, but the statement stands. They're part of team Bare Minimum. Team It's All About Me. Team Fear And Violence Because We Just Keep Reacting To Shit We Don't Understand. 


I don't mean this religiously, but just generically -- Do you know what makes hell, well, *Hell*?  The understanding there is a place that isn't Hell. Without our dreams we simply accept what is, whatever it is. Hell couldn't be hell if we could not dream of anything else. Hell, as they say, is other people. This is what you feel, this is why you feel it. But how do you leave it behind? 



Well, you can accept it, like the rest did. Or you can understand it and harness it. I have a homework assignment for you. There was a Holocaust survivor, Elie Wiesel, and he gave a speech a couple years after the above quote. You can look it up, it's titled The Perils of Indifference. Have a listen. He speaks directly to the apathy that caused one of the worst tragedies in human history, and he does not hold back. I don't know that there's any peace to be had in this world, but if there is, you deserve a little of it."	IanVM36	reply	na	na	na	0.9957347512245178	no	no	strong	na	dbtselfhelp
"It’s okay to not feel okay about the unfairness of life but you’re gonna have to accept that this is how life is. That being said, just because you accept that life is unfair doesn’t mean you’re okay with it. Realistically speaking you cannot do anything to change how life works. This is a force beyond you and for that reason, you need to give yourself some peace and let it go. 

Now you say you have a strong sense of fairness and justice which imo sounds like you’re approaching life with an idealistic point of view, where you focus more on how things should be rather than what they actually are and because life never meets that ideal standard, you feel this rage and it discourages you from being productive. You’ve set yourself up to feel this disappointment well in advance by placing ideal standards for a life that’s far from ideal. It’s like, why even bother trying if this is an endless rat race without goals? 

I think a way you can go about this is to absolutely let go of that idealistic point of view, stop focusing on things you cannot control, and instead focus on what you can control. You can’t control life and make it fair, but you have some control over yourself and how you approach life.

I’ve struggled with the purpose of life and I personally came to the conclusion that life isn’t inherently special, but the purpose I assigned to myself as an individual is to strive to be the best version of myself and make the most out of life before I die. It is a waste of time and energy to dwell on how life should be when you could be figuring out how to adapt and grow despite the unfairness of life."

"I haven't read this book, but The Miracle of Mindfulness by Thich Nhat Hanh might be a good book to read. From what I read, he wrote the book for those who had to endure the aftermath of the Vietnam War, one of the worst unjust situations one can ever be in. 

DBT's concepts like willingness, etc. seem to come from this book, so maybe you can explore that a bit more? I'm reading the Art of Living by the same author, and he is really good at explaining complicated ideas/ wisdom in a simple language."

"DBT is a tool. It's really great at getting us to feel a greater sense of internal calm and acceptance about our immediate circumstances, but that's also a limitation. Mindfulness is one step along the way, it isn't everything. Think about how a focus on mindfulness training in the workplace can be coopted to make us more complicit and efficient as workers. We're only human, sometimes you can't just reach perfect inner zen over the entire world. It's ok to care.

Being fair with yourself is a necessary part of mental health as well. Radical acceptance doesn't mean you have to be dishonest with yourself, you don't have to say ""I'm completely happy with everything"" or convince yourself we can simply mindfulness ourselves into saving the world. When people say ""life isn't fair"" as if they've just accepted it and moved on, it's just sad. It's a thought terminating cliche and it stops people from actually imagining a better world. Meanwhile fairness is actively happening, it's at the hands of the people who put in the love and care to do something about it."	IanVM36	reply	na	na	na	0.9957347512245178	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I am so sorry that you feel this way about your life. You're not the only one who feels like that. It can feel unfair that others get what you're struggling to get without having to do everything you are doing to get them. 

While we are all dealt different cards in this game of life, we are ONLY responsible for what we make of our life. I understand it will be hard for you to go from life isn't fair to life is amazing, here's a few things you can incorporate slowly into your day to day to guide this along.

&#x200B;

1. We tend to compare our lives with those of others when we are focusing on the good things that are in our life. This could be because of many things. Top of the list could be, you're always on your devices first thing in the morning and last thing before you go to bed. These two times are the perfect time for installing beliefs into your subconscious, which is the 90% part of your mind that governs your beliefs, your values etc. If you spend this time scrolling online and you're bombarded with all of these people leading good lives and you're thinking to yourself, ""this is so unfair, they get everything, i get nothing etc"" What you're installing in your mind, will reinforce as you sleep. Instead spend this time thinking about what would your life look like if things started turning around. Its like day dreaming, you start feeling good, excited etc in your body and at the same time, you're installing that program/belief into your subconscious mind, which takes over when you fall asleep. Then in the morning immediately after you wake up, think about your day, what would a great day look like for you. Be realistic, in terms of, simple things like feeling the morning sun, enjoying a delicious breakfast, chatting with someone you like etc. simple things that could happen. Visualize them in your head. This also puts you in a good mood. Because the mind cannot differentiate when something is happening in real life or in your head. for example, look at when you start thinking about a fight or something that annoyed you, you start feeling the same sensations you felt in your body when it was happening, even if at the moment you're remembering it. That is the trick underneath all of this, and then when you start your day you're starting in a good mood. Go ahead and do somethings that you visualized, make yourself a delicious filling breakfast etc. 
2. Your focus, your attention is the most important thing you have. What you focus more on, is what will appear in your life. Lemme use a metaphor to help you understand what i mean. The tiktok algorithm is perfect for this. On tiktok, the more you watch a video, the more it learns what you like. If a video comes on your fyp and its really triggering you so you engage with it, you comment, you tag your friends etc. What that tells the algorithm is that this is the type of content you like to see because you are engaging with it. That's how life is. If something annoys you etc, and you don't want it in your life, don't engage with it. Instead go inwards, in your body, you could start by noticing how shallow or fast your breathe is and start consciously slowing it down. If the people you follow on instagram, facebook  or tiktok make you mad or trigger you, start unfollowing them as you come across them on your feed. Your attention is so precious to spend on something that doesn't add value to your life. 
3. Start being compassionate with yourself. it's going to take some time for you to get to a great place, but everything you do towards getting there will add up. Be patient with yourself and understand that its a common human struggle to feel that life is unfair. Being self compassionate is like building blocks for support. Imagine 2 people are training for a  race, they've both got a coach, one is always tearing them down, criticizing them and making fun of them for trying and failing. The other is compassionate, always cheering them on, when they fail, they help them get up and show them the lesson in the mistake. Who do you think will win the race? To learn self compassion, because it can be learned, check out this website [https://self-compassion.org/](https://self-compassion.org/) and binge everything on there. There's even free compassion exercises there, 
4. Start a gratitude list, not for silly things like the weather is nice. But for things that matter to you. This time you can compare yourself to someone who has had it worse than you. Write down the things you have that they don't that you're grateful for. If you have a home, you can feel grateful for it if you remember the homeless man/woman in town. And for everything you write really think about what it would be like if you didn't have it. Spend some time writing this list and write the things that you feel truly grateful for. 

I know this advice isn't like a billionaire adopting you or sending you loads of cash. However, we only have our lives to tend to. If we ignore our lives and constantly compare ourselves to others, we will never feel satisfied. But if we are grateful for the simple things that we have and we cultivate more by tapping into the optimal times to program our subconscious, we can create the life of our dreams. 

Tapping into time before bed and time after waking up consistently, with repetition with intention, is co-creating with the universe. 

You also have to take your power back. You can't be a victim and co-creator at the same time. YOU CAN Create all these opportunities that you envy in other people's lives. but you first have to believe that you can do it, so you can start where you are. 

Please look up Joe Dispenza, he provides meditations to listen to before bed, when you wake up, to help accelerate these steps. 

Life is like a video game, you have to pass the challenges of the first level to get to the second level. This is your challenge, don't let it overpower you. Take back your power and start playing accordingly. 

I love you so much, please know you're not alone. Be your cheerleader and soon, you'll start seeing the life of your dreams unfolding before your eyes."	IanVM36	reply	na	na	na	0.9957347512245178	strong	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
I just try not to think about it. If I do, then I just decide that if suffering is a natural part of every sentient creature's lifetime, then it must be a good thing. And then I watch YouTube and browse reddit to avoid thinking about the implications of that.	IanVM36	reply	na	na	na	0.9957347512245178	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I don't think It is a matter to be okay with. Resignation is different from the stoicism-ish dbt is trying to achieve. 

World is full of misery, hunger, poverty. We should not resignate. A wise mind is balancing what the hell you are going to do with that feeling. Is this much of anger invalidating my perception, clouding strategic thinking to do something about It? Does only suffering blindness comes out of It? Is that feeling affecting directly my work, relations? Making me jealous, bitter?

Most lines of therapy do not do the most fundamental basic, which is a social class cut. Poor people struggle to survive, and is not a matter of individual effort, lack of emotional skills or self acceptance. Not having housing security is a valid fear. Struggle to eat is a valid fear, empathy for the miserable is a valid feeling. 

Balance is found by validating these feelings, not in resignation. Balance is found in the capacity of not falling into a ruminant spiral of blaming and jealousy and anger. You need to be angry, because yes, it is unfair. Anger is a valid feeling towards Injustice. 

I'm going to use that dumbass airplane oxygen mask metaphor again. You can only help other people to put their masks on, after you put It on you. There is absolutely no way we can make a difference, If we do not have your shit together. We help other people by helping ourselves first. Our empathy will not leave out bodies by training dbt skills. We just can now manage It and do something about It."	IanVM36	reply	na	na	na	0.9957347512245178	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I don't know but my limited knowledge of DBT says that you might follow the process of checking your reality against facts vs. judgements pertaining to your situation, decide whether your emotions are accurate and act accordingly. 

Like how directly unfair is your situation or do you only think it's unfair?

Like maybe your feelings are not 100% reflecting the situation in which case you are feeling a secondary emotion that is being triggered by trauma. 

Or maybe your feelings 100% reflect things as they truly are in which case you need to, again, look at your emotions and see what they really are and act on those feelings as best you can.

Different people tend to deal differently. Big existential thoughts like the unfairness of life tend to make me sad. My tendency when sad is to isolate. Because that is my tendency when I am sad I try to get out and not isolate - I perform the opposite action.

But then there are untenable situations where you can do all the emotional work and there really is no way out in which case you have to practice some form of radical acceptance which is basically the act of saying ""well this sucks but I cannot change it so I just accept it and try to let go of this bitterness"".

It's really dependent on what emotions unfairness is causing for you and how you feel. 

For example maybe I feel like its really unfair I did not have a nice childhood and it makes me feel angry at my Dad or something. In this case I am not going to go yell at him for something that happened years ago. Instead I am going to do something else to alleviate this anger like do something nice for someone - I don't know bad example.

Very often for things there is no fix and you just have to accept it and move on or try to. 

Short Answer: DBT would say it's contextual to what you are feeling and the emotions you are looking to deal with. Basically if you can deal with the unfairness itself if you cannot then deal with the emotions and behaviour the unfairness causes and if none is possible try to radically accept."

That story reminds me of this book I sometimes read. 7 habits of highly effective people. And one habit is focusing on what you can control rather on things you can’t, to grow your circle of influence. Something else that helps me is that everyone can have a good idea of how things can get worse but it’s very hard to imagine how things can get better. In a more specific way, and we don’t really know how positivity we can effect the world until later but we know in the immediate sense how things can get worse. And we know how to make things less worse for sure.	IanVM36	reply	na	na	na	0.9957347512245178	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

But if the peasant reflects further, he'd realize that there is no reason the crops should bring him joy. He can eat them, but why does it matter? You may say so that he can be full, but if he is hungry, he only suffers because he cares about whether he is hungry. You may say so that he can survive, but isn't it his own fault for caring about whether he lives?	IanVM36	reply	na	na	na	0.9957347512245178	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

Hey there, I hear you on this. I have similar issues with self righteousness and strong lines of right and wrong that as I get older Im realizing is my moral code and not necessarily what others feel or are bound to. I think the important key to willingness is the realization that you don't have to change anyone or anything else to get relief. That if you shift your perspective it can also be meaningful without the insurmountable (and impossible) task of changing everyone else. I think of willingness as the ability to recognize where my expectations are getting in the way of reality and then aligning my perspective with reality, and trying to do so with the best attitude toward myself and others.

"Sounds like you've really been in the sh-t. Most people don't go looking for that sort of thing unless they have. 


The sad truth is this society isolates people -- we're shoved into muave colored social isolation boxes known as suburbia. There's no community spaces left. Nobody goes to the park. We all just sit at home and marinate in existential dread while a drip-feed of consumerism and narcissistic non-sense is fed to us in the form of the 24/7 news cycle. And it's very, very hard to find the free time to go out and meet people when you live in society that wants to work everyone to death and keep them in a heightened state of anxiety because fear makes people productive, even if it does destroy their mental health in the process. This is a profoundly sick society and it's not your fault you fell down because you didn't -- you were pushed. We were all pushed and bullied into this. 


Do some volunteer work, even if it's just online. Ask yourself where others with the same strong sense of justice would spend their time and go there. Believe that you're not alone, that there are still people who care as much as you do. You just need to stand in the right places to see and be seen. It's like I said -- it's an active choice, and it's one most people don't make. But not because they're bad people -- try to see that too: They're just overworked, exhausted, and isolated. Most of us are. 


The last few years have been an absolute hell on anyone with a heart. The pain and rage you feel means you still have a heart. Don't let it get swallowed up by this. And don't feel bad because you fell down. We all have to take a turn. The first medicine we learned as a species was to bring the injured food and water and stand watch over them, to keep them safe from predators. The word for this behavior, is love. It's not an emotion, it's a promise to not abandon someone else just to save our own ass. If the world seems dark to you now, remember that just as all our ancestors had to do, you must now lead the rest by example. Don't talk about justice -- *demonstrate it*."

"Then, this is another take. This is another skill. I have just said is not a matter to move to idgafganistan. Anger is a valid feeling. Dbt is not going to turn you into a resignated robot. Is more about giving you the tools to navigate inside your own head to find perspective, hope, and engage better solutions, engaging, learning. The tools that will guide you into healthier relationships, the tools that will make you see that some people are fighting with willfire, people that inspire a better future, that something at some point is about to snap. 

This is something else. 

You need to see that our mental health deceives our perception. The hardest part is to differenciate what is a feeling, what is a symptom. Being sad and angry is valid. Putting everything into a nihilist hopeless perspective is not. Some people need external help otherwise dbt espirals into self gaslighting. Balance is needed. The wise mind thing. Know that all feelings just exist, there are no bad feelings, its there for a reason, its a response to a enviroment. 

Once more, put HOPE and effort into modifying yourself and your behavior first, when you believe you can do it, and see actual change, perspective about the world changes too. Believe you can shift behavior and thinking patterns, believe in your capacity to achieve and live within your values, and I promise with all my life, that perspective and vision of the world changes with you.

"Ah, got it--yeah, it sounds like the primary skill you need is radical acceptance (dialectics will follow). Instead of directing your energy to the thought, ""My life will never be fulfilled because of this super dangerous surgery,"" try to radically accept that you weren't born the way you wanted to be. Once you radically accept that, you'll stop ruminating on what's unfair and think, ""ok, how do I problem solve the parts I *can* change? What can I do to make myself happy *despite* the limitations of my body?"" Basically the entire point of radical acceptance is to decrease bitterness and make you feel empowered about what you *can* do. I totally acknowledge that it's super super hard! There are STILL times I'm really bitter about how ""late"" I am in every point of my career, haha. But radical acceptance paradoxically reminds me that there is still so much in my control.

"I hear you. I hope we dont sound dismissive. I guess I'd say when I was especially struggling with this my thinking was also very fast. I struggled to slow down my thoughts and even arrive to why I was having such strong emotional reactions to things that were happening with other people and outside of me. Acceptance is not a final ending point to a feeling. I think the best way I'd describe it is a meditation, coupled with deep honesty about your limitations as one single person, who is also flawed. It's also not about feeling okay with the situation which is where I definitely struggled, as well. I thought accepting meant exactly what you said, the expectation that I'd feel okay or confident over what is happening. I now know that acceptance means there is no expectation of feeling okay. Simply acknowledgement (or observation) that what is happening is happening, that I don't have to play make (because ultimately it won't change anything), I dont have to orchestrate ( I dont have that power), I can cry and rage (that still won't change what is currently happening, I also have enough foresight and experience to know this will make me feel like shit).

Literally writing it out as I just have, going through all the different points of the process of acceptance is what will help it feel like something you can start to practice and shift you away from thoughts that ultimately are not getting you the relief from the existential agitation you are feeling."

Per the [community wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/dbtselfhelp/wiki/faq/quickfix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&utm_content=1&utm_term=22): ""DBT **absolutely** requires additional help and oversight from a trained professional to ensure you understand it and are using it effectively...When DBT is not practiced as designed, the results may not be effective which may cause that person to lose hope and trust and then be reluctant to ever try it again. They might blame themselves, the program, or even both."" 

This is because the statistics of DBT success when even one of the components is missing drops precipitously. There have never been studies on ""self-taught DBT,"" which technically is not DBT, but based on the other statistics it has been assumed that the success rates are abysmal. 

That being said, as some who participate in this subreddit demonstrate, there are some people with enough determination, curiosity, emotional resiliency, and innate wise mindedness that they *do* manage to teach themselves DBT. This is extraordinarily rare, so I do want to warn you of the enormous rate of failure you are facing by not going through an official group. Please note that you would not be a failure, but rather completely normal if you fail. I'm not trying to be mean, but I encourage you to read through the wiki page for why ""self-taught DBT"" is discouraged.

Best of luck either way! I hope you find your DBT journey fruitful :)"	Jax_for_now	reply	na	na	na	0.00557327177375555	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Ah, got it! I think someone with DBT experience would definitely be ideal; the problem with self taught DBT is mostly that DBT concepts are very often prone to misunderstanding, so having an expert who can clear up any questions is usually necessary--of course, this is no longer a problem if you work with a DBT professional!

"It has been a thing my entire life that inanimate objects bear the brunt of Frustration-based episodes of emotional dysregulation. I've put holes in walls, snapped phones over my knee, disintegrated things with my bare hands in the past.

For a few months things have been fine, but life stress and a few other things outside of my direct control have been weighing me down again, and those urges are coming back to the front of my mind.

As of this morning, I got frustrated with my phone and pitched it into the road. Feels like I haven't done that in ages, and dealing with a crushing amount of shame for having to drop money on a new one today.

What skills or techniques might y'all suggest for dealing with extreme amounts of frustration and willful behavior, as well as any tips for communicating with my close contacts who are a mixture of worried for me and afraid of me?"	portobox1	post	29.40291340143109	male	White	0.9914615154266357	na	na	na	2	dbtselfhelp

My City of New Orleans just had an article in the newspaper several days ago about a Rage Room called the Break Room. Of course you wear a helmet with a visor. You can bring your own objects to destroy. But it contains things in it already, such as old typewriters etc, and on the wall their hangs a bat and a sledge hammer. The article I read included a woman who had brought a fancy teapot. So if you can purposefully collect things that you can eventually break..this is a form of stress release.	portobox1	reply	na	na	na	0.9914615154266357	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

I'm sad though because my therapy place closed down (the owner moved to a different state), but I know where to move to. My current therapist moved to one new place and they have DBT. Only thing is it's not comprehensive. I found a place that's comprehensive but it's online only and I'd have to leave my therapist. I guess I'll have to decide what I want for the next round. I plan to do one more round of stage 1 DBT and then work with my therapist to help me with stuff.

"That's wonderful to hear that you found DBT to be incredibly helpful for you! It's great that you've gained skills that have made a positive impact on your life. Transitioning to a new therapy place can be a challenging decision, but ultimately, it's important to find a setting that meets your needs and provides the level of support you require.  
Consider weighing the pros and cons of the options available to you. Think about what aspects of therapy are most important to you, such as the comprehensive nature of the program, in-person sessions versus online, and the connection you have with your therapist. Reflect on what has worked well for you in your current therapy experience and what you feel you still need to address in the next round of DBT.  
If you decide to switch to the comprehensive online program, it may be helpful to discuss this decision with your current therapist. They can offer insights and guidance based on their understanding of your progress and goals. They may also be able to provide recommendations or referrals for therapists or programs that align with your needs.  
Remember that therapy is a journey, and it's important to find a supportive environment that allows you to continue growing and working on your goals. Trust your instincts and make a decision that feels right for you. It's encouraging to hear that you have a plan in place for your next round of DBT and that you'll continue working with your therapist to address any ongoing challenges.

"That's fantastic to hear that incorporating these daily habits and spending time in nature has been making a positive difference in how you feel! It's amazing how simple activities like going for a walk and staying hydrated can have such a significant impact on our well-being.  
Spending time in nature has been shown to have numerous benefits for mental health, including reducing stress, improving mood, and enhancing overall well-being. The fresh air, green surroundings, and the opportunity to disconnect from screens and daily stresses can be rejuvenating and provide a sense of calm and relaxation.  
Drinking an adequate amount of water is essential for maintaining proper bodily function, and dehydration can indeed contribute to feelings of fatigue and low mood. By staying hydrated, you're providing your body with the necessary support for optimal physical and mental health.  
It's great that you've developed a reward system to stay motivated and track your progress. Rewarding yourself for meeting goals can help reinforce positive habits and keep you motivated to continue making positive changes. Saving quarters and using a wooden ruler as a visual progress tracker sounds like a creative and fun way to monitor your achievements.  
Remember to listen to your body and adjust your goals and habits as needed. Pay attention to how these activities make you feel and make any necessary modifications to ensure they continue to be beneficial for you.  
Keep up the excellent work with your daily habits, and continue to prioritize self-care and well-being. Small, consistent steps can lead to significant improvements over time.

Not necessarily DBT skills but I've also reached out to almost all my friends and family, it's been nice being able to call or text a different person every hour so not one person Is exhausted with my sadness.

"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through a breakup and feeling this way. Breakups can be incredibly challenging and emotionally draining, and it's normal to experience a range of difficult emotions during this time. It's important to give yourself permission to grieve and process your emotions at your own pace.  
Here are a few suggestions that may help you navigate this difficult period:  
Allow yourself to feel: It's important to acknowledge and validate your emotions. Allow yourself to feel sadness, anger, or any other emotions that come up. Give yourself time and space to grieve the loss of the relationship.  
Reach out for support: Surround yourself with a support system of friends, family, or a therapist who can provide a listening ear and offer guidance. Sharing your feelings and thoughts with others who care about you can help alleviate some of the emotional burden.  
Practice self-care: Although it may feel challenging, try to prioritize self-care during this time. Focus on activities that bring you comfort and solace, whether it's taking a warm bath, going for a walk in nature, listening to calming music, or engaging in hobbies you enjoy.  
Take it one day at a time: Healing takes time, and it's essential to be patient with yourself. Try not to put pressure on yourself to ""get over"" the breakup quickly. Take things one day at a time and allow yourself to heal gradually.  
Seek professional help if needed: If you find that your emotions are overwhelming or interfering with your daily functioning for an extended period, it may be helpful to reach out to a mental health professional. They can provide guidance, support, and specific strategies tailored to your situation.  
Remember, it's okay to ask for help when you need it, and you don't have to go through this alone. Lean on your support system and take care of yourself during this challenging time."	splatbombs	reply	na	na	na	0.9994163513183594	strong	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Honestly? A peaceful life full of respect and kindness. I’m done with drama and over-the-top emotions. That rollercoaster was exhausting and I don’t want to get back on that ride. 

I have BPD with comorbid conditions—ADHD (primarily inattentive), general anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder. I’ve found a great balance with all the meds, but the thing that helps the most?

DBT. 

I use my skills all the time. I don’t need distress tolerance nearly as much as I used to thanks to DBT, but I still have my distress tolerance kit ready. I use mindfulness almost every day, and always try to approach situations in an open and empathetic way—everyone is doing the best they can with what they have, and leading with that approach cuts down so much on jumping to conclusions, looking to take offense to something they say, etc. 

Conflict in my life is almost nothing compared to what it was. Challenging tasks are just that—challenges, and not causes for complete meltdowns. 

Am I perfect? Absolutely not. Do I still go off the rails? Yes—with the caveat that I almost always only go off the rails for something important, like maintaining my boundaries or standing up for myself. It’s not effective but we all have our triggers and our limits. Even neurotypicals lose it every now and then. 

My life worth living is one where I get to help instead of hurt, heal instead of beat up on myself, learn and grow instead of taking constructive feedback as an attack, and more. Life isn’t as scary anymore, and I trust myself to handle just about any situation thanks to the DBT skills I’ve learned and practice daily."

"I can't easily articulate my image of a life worth living, but here are my *current* goals. They serve as reminders of new ways I hope to align my thinking, feeling and action.  

• Gain tranquility  

• Increase non-attachment to people, material objects, the future and the self  

• Do not forget that emotions do not need to be translated into actions  

• Extend patience and kindness to everyone you encounter  

•Practice forgiveness  

• Trade arrogance for pride  

• Nurture lovingkindness  

• Give up having to prove anything  

• Love all, serve all  

• Boundaries are desirable if they are not prisons  

• Accepting that others' realities exist does demand that I live within them  

It's vital to remember that these ideas do not only apply to my relationships with others, but to my relationship with myself as well. 

I use a number of therapies to reprogram myself and change my behavior so that it aligns with these imperatives: psychotherapy, medication, DBT, meditation, the occasional intentional use of large doses of psychedelics, and practicing the observation and regulation of my emotions and behavior. Of course, all of these therapies are mutually supportive, and many of them can be practiced in a variety of combinations simultaneously."

“You must watch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites, must quit your acquaintance, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those you meet, come off worse than others in everything, in magistracies, in honors, in courts of judicature. When you have considered all these things round, approach if you please; if, by parting with them, you have a mind to purchase equanimity, freedom, and tranquility.”

"You don't need a diagnosis to experience this. It's common for abuse survivors. Bad people *don't* deserve respect -- they're bad people. The problem here is just black and white thinking.

So now you only have two states -- either you don't care, or you're frothing at the mouth.

"Recognizing that your way of thinking is impacting your relationships is an important first step toward personal growth and change. While I'm an AI language model and not a mental health professional, I can offer some general suggestions that may help you in addressing these challenges:  
Seek professional help: Consider reaching out to a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, who can provide a proper diagnosis and guide you through the process of understanding and managing your thoughts and behaviors. They can help you explore your beliefs, emotions, and reactions in a safe and supportive environment.  
Practice self-awareness: Pay attention to your thoughts, emotions, and reactions in different situations. Try to identify patterns and triggers that contribute to your negative responses. By becoming more aware of your own thought processes, you can start to challenge and reshape them over time.  
Develop empathy: Empathy is an important aspect of healthy relationships. Practice putting yourself in others' shoes and try to understand their perspectives and emotions. This can help you develop more compassionate responses and avoid acting out with anger or hostility.  
Challenge negative beliefs: Take a critical look at your beliefs and question whether they are helping or hindering your relationships. Consider alternative perspectives and challenge any black-and-white thinking or rigid beliefs that may be contributing to your negative reactions.  
Learn and apply healthy coping strategies: Explore and adopt healthy coping mechanisms that can help you manage stress, regulate your emotions, and respond to situations in a more constructive way. This may include techniques like deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, journaling, or engaging in hobbies or activities that bring you joy and relaxation.  
Remember, it's important to consult with a mental health professional who can provide a comprehensive assessment and tailored guidance based on your specific circumstances. They can help you gain deeper insights into your thoughts and behaviors, and provide effective strategies for personal growth and positive change."	dandyducksauce	reply	na	na	na	0.9964445233345032	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

It sounds like you are struggling with black and white thinking. This is common with BPD, and also with autism, ADHD, and other neurodivergence and mental health conditions. It also sounds like you are judging yourself harshly (in my view, based on you describing your beliefs as bad). But the good news (that I learned in DBT) is: empathy is a skill, and as such, it can be learned, built, practiced. So, if you want to work on being more empathetic, you can absolutely do that (and DBT has great skills to help you do so). And DBT also helped me release a lot of my self-judgment, which seems like it could be beneficial for you, too.	dandyducksauce	reply	na	na	na	0.9964445233345032	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

It could be that you need to change an aspect of your life, like moving out of an abusive home, getting better help for a chronic illness, finding friends you can be vulnerable with, finding a job you can be happy at, etc

"I understand that it can feel discouraging when you're going through emotional pain and it seems like nothing is helping. Healing and feeling better is a process that can take time, and it can vary for each individual. While I'm here to offer support, it's important to remember that I am an AI language model and not a substitute for professional help.  
Seeking support from a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, can be instrumental in finding ways to alleviate your emotional pain and improve your well-being. They can work with you to explore the underlying causes of your pain and help you develop effective coping strategies. Therapy can provide a safe and supportive environment for you to express your feelings, gain insight into your thoughts and behaviors, and learn healthier ways to navigate through challenging situations.  
In addition to professional support, it's important to practice self-care and be patient with yourself. Healing takes time, and it's okay to experience ups and downs along the way. Remember to prioritize self-compassion, engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation, maintain a healthy lifestyle, and reach out to supportive friends or loved ones when you need to talk or lean on someone.  
It's important to keep in mind that everyone's journey is unique, and what works for one person may not work the same for another. Stay committed to your personal growth and be open to exploring different strategies and approaches. With time, support, and self-care, it is possible to experience relief and move toward a place of emotional well-being."	IanVM36	reply	na	na	na	0.9989797472953796	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
Hello, whenever I was driven by strong emotions, I'd treat others with disrespect or, let's say, write a super nasty product review if something didn't live up to my expectations. Thanks to dialectical behavioral therapy, I have learnt to stop myself from acting out of anger. Instead of acting on impulse, I'd now delay my reaction to triggering situations for hours, if not days. I suspect that kind of makes me a bad employee in the corporate industry. The point is I cannot handle tasks effectively and fail to deal with situations fast. Is there something I am missing about DBT, or is it just my job that doesn't suit me at all?

"It's great to hear that you have been able to apply the skills you've learned in dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) to manage your anger and impulsive reactions. DBT is primarily focused on helping individuals regulate emotions, improve interpersonal relationships, and develop effective coping strategies. However, it's important to note that DBT alone may not address all aspects of job performance or suitability.  
It's possible that the challenges you're experiencing in your job are not solely related to your use of DBT skills. There could be other factors at play, such as the specific demands of your role, the work environment, or the overall fit between your skills, interests, and job responsibilities. It may be helpful to reflect on whether the nature of your job aligns with your strengths, values, and long-term career goals.  
Additionally, it's important to remember that DBT is a comprehensive therapy that covers a wide range of skills beyond emotion regulation. It includes modules on mindfulness, distress tolerance, and interpersonal effectiveness. While delaying reactions to triggering situations can be beneficial for managing anger, it's also important to develop strategies to effectively address tasks and situations in a timely manner. This could involve learning time management techniques, prioritization skills, and effective communication strategies to navigate workplace challenges more effectively.  
Consider exploring these aspects further with your therapist or a career counselor to gain additional insights into your work-related challenges. They can help you assess whether it's a matter of job fit, skill development, or a combination of factors. It's important to find a balance that allows you to apply DBT skills while also meeting the demands of your job and feeling fulfilled in your career."

"So, about three weeks ago I started self DBT and have been going only about mindfulness at the moment. I have a schizoanalysis therapist and will do the program in addition to it for my depression.

I've read some books the latest being ""Building a Life Worth Living"" and have started today with the Courtney & Lane one. I've download the app Daylio to keep my diary cards. 

But my main fears going into this are: going through many skills, getting overwhelmed and stop doing it. How long until a new skill? One at a week? How to keep worksheets?

And the other is simply not being able to reinforce on a skill or doing and feeling still really bad and starting to abandon the ones as time goes on: how do you manage that?"	nighttime31	post	33.830806807597604	female	White	0.9866598844528198	na	na	na	11	dbtselfhelp
Do whatever feels good for you. I stopped diary cards because I found I already focused on the target behaviors I was doing, and they didn't do anything for me anymore. Use any skills that work, try one a week, try one a day, if it works, keep using it. And it's easy to be afraid we will stop using the skills, that's why we have to use them when we don't feel bad so it reinforces the behavior of doing it when we do feel bad. Also, I recently found that these skills won't fix us. Like, at all. They are there to ground us when in distress and put us back into Wise Mind/ within the window of tolerance. So, we will still feel bad, but that doesn't mean we should stop using them or that they don't work. Skills are to help us manage. Not fix.	nighttime31	reply	na	na	na	0.9866598844528198	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"It's great to hear that you're engaging in self-DBT and finding resources that can support your journey. It's normal to have concerns about feeling overwhelmed or losing motivation along the way. Here are some suggestions to help address your fears and make your self-DBT practice more manageable:  
Start with one skill at a time: It's a good idea to focus on one skill at a time, especially when you're just starting out. Give yourself enough time to understand and practice the skill before moving on to the next one. This allows you to develop a solid foundation and integrate the skills into your daily life.  
Set a realistic pace: The frequency at which you introduce new skills is a personal choice. Some people find it helpful to introduce a new skill every week, while others prefer a slower pace. Listen to your own needs and abilities. If you feel overwhelmed, it's okay to take a break or spend more time on a particular skill.  
Create a system for keeping track: Keeping worksheets and maintaining a record of your progress can be helpful. Consider using a journal, digital apps, or even a dedicated folder on your computer to store your worksheets. Find a system that works best for you and helps you stay organized and motivated.  
Be consistent and persistent: DBT skills are most effective when practiced consistently over time. It's important to be patient with yourself and understand that change takes time. Even if you have setbacks or feel like a skill isn't working initially, keep trying and adjusting your approach. Remember that progress is not always linear, and small steps forward are still valuable.  
Seek support and accountability: Consider finding a DBT support group, joining an online community, or sharing your progress with a trusted friend or therapist. Having a support system can help you stay motivated, share insights, and gain encouragement from others who are also working on their well-being.  
Lastly, it's important to remember that self-DBT is a supplemental approach, and it's great that you're also working with a schizoanalysis therapist. They can provide guidance, feedback, and support as you navigate your depression and engage in DBT.  
Take things at your own pace, be patient and kind to yourself, and remember that each step you take towards building a life worth living is a step in the right direction."	nighttime31	reply	na	na	na	0.9866598844528198	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Hello! Fellow self DTB person here. I'm doing DBT by myself, along with the individual IFS (internal family systems) therapy.   
When it comes to keeping myself motivated, I usually spend the first 10 minutes of my individual therapy discussing the progress I'm making in my self DBT work. Fortunately, my IFS therapist is familiar with DBT, so it works well. She usually compliments me for them, so that motivates me lol  
I also keep a general ""Progress Notes,"" where I jot down any and all positive changes I'm making. The notes serve as a nice reminder to myself, especially when I'm feeling down.   
As for the pace of doing DBT, I highly recommend reading the Training Manual (https://a.co/d/9xOsS0f). The book offers several different versions of the DBT curriculum with descriptions about which skills are covered when. I created my own curriculum for myself, but reading about the existing ones was very helpful.

"So I have been doing DBT for almost 6 months now, and I'm finding that I am going round and round in circles. I feel as though I have one foot quite firmly in DBT, committed, wanted to change and have that dream 'life worth living', but the other foot is very firmly not, and keeps falling back to k illing myself, etc.

I think one of the issues is I find 'a life worth living' such a tricky concept. Not only does it feel really wanky and preachy, but it is also a concept I am just not familiar with. I'm autistic and so I struggle to envision things I've not experienced before, and I don't think I've ever truly be happy, not long term or for a sustained period, and if I have, I don't remember it. Due to this, I find it really hard to envision a life worth living for myself because I just do not know what that looks like. I don't know what a life I value would include. 

I know what I want to do for a career, and I'm ambitious and know I want to do well, and I know I want to travel the world, but other than that I don't know what I would want my life to look like if I envisioned one where I was happy. It makes me really sad to think I can't even imagine what happiness looks like to me. 

I am also really aware that a big part of the problem I am facing right now, of having one foot in, one foot out, is fear. Deep down inside I am scared of life. I'm scared of living and not being happy, but also scared of living AND being happy. I'm scared of failing, at anything, of not being enough, or being too much.  I'm scared of being alone forever, but also subjecting a partner to, well... me.

I just feel stuck, so stuck. And scared. And trapped. And that trapped feeling is the most dangerous for me as that's what sets off the dangerous thoughts and the actions that go with it.

Sorry for such a long post, if you've read this far, thank you. If anyone has any advice, or can relate at all, I'd love to hear it because right now I feel so alone and clueless as to what to do. Also, please bare in mind I'm autistic, so please be as clear as possible, or at least patient with me if I ask you to explain your point, as I often misunderstand people - thank you."

"Hey, I'm sorry that you're struggling so much. From what I read in your comment your feelings make a lot of sense.Firstly I want to know if you've heard of Aphantasia? It's very common, particularly for people with Autism and other Neurodiversity and it means when you 'imagine' you don't see pictures, it's also hard to visualise something when you're told to - like being told to imagine your future. I don't personally have Aphantasia but a lot of people I work with do and for those people they had similar difficulty in 'imagining a life worth living' and had to reframe the idea for themselvesIt may be worthwhile checking out the Aphantasia groups on reddit because you say you can't imagine things you haven't already experienced and from my limited understanding that is a symptom of Aphantasia. Having support around this way of thinking might be helpful as so much of the language in DBT is around imagining or visualising.

Ok, so onto your actual post - I had a similar issue with trying to build a 'life worth living' for myself. I knew that I wanted to 'be successful and happy' but I didn't know what that really meant. For me the most helpful thing was to sit down and write a 1, 5 and 10 year plan.

Try to use your Non-Judgmental skill when doing something like this because there is probably going to be a little voice in your head that says things like ""you can't do that"" or ""thats a silly goal"". A way I combat this is I break my goals down into categories, I use- Life Goals- Fun Goals- Wildest Dream Goals

Once you have a list of things that you'd like to get done over the year you can start to look at what a life worth living actually looks like in a more practical way - which may help you to move past that idea that it's a wanky preachy concept.

As for the fear of being happy/unhappy, this is where Radical Acceptance can be super helpful. The thing is, no human being on planet earth is capable of being happy all the time. Everyone feels a mixture of emotions and usually sadness, regret, shame, jealousy, anger and fear are in there pretty frequently. Depending on the individual those emotions can be bigger than they are for others, but everyone has  good and bad days. We need all those emotions because they teach us so much about what we like, how we want to be treated, how we want to live and how we want to move through life.Also, every single person fails. In big, small and in between ways. But 'Failure' is just your First Attempt In Learning something new. Failure is the stepping stone you need to find out what a life worth living really looks like for you. You try something, you fail, you assess what went wrong and use what you learn from it to get better next time. It's the best and most reliable way to build your sense of self.

It's normal and understandable to be afraid of failure, but try to Radically Accept that it is part of life.

On days where I feel trapped I find that working on one small goal at a time is the most useful. If you've got your 1, 5 and 10 year plan you can choose one goal off there to work on. Sometimes I like to make lists of tasks I need to do for the day and choose just one to get done. Usually accomplishing something helps me to feel less trapped and gives me confidence that I can do things - This is similar to the skill of Building Mastery. Building Mastery is a great skill for increasing confidence and a sense of pride in yourself.

"I'm the same — probably a step or two behind you (figuratively speaking). I think it's great you know what you want to do career-wise and that you have goals and aspirations. As time goes by, I reckon you'll get new goals and dreams. If you don't already, write this stuff down. Keep a list. Also keep a list of moments you're happy or even moments not-sad as proof those moments exists.

I personally try not to think too far ahead in the future. Depending on how much I can handle, I take it a month at a time, a week at a time, a day at a time, or an hour at a time. Ten minute intervals on really bad days. If I start thinking about how I'm going to survive the next ten years, it becomes way too scary. I only need to get through today; my future self can handle tomorrow. 

Circumstances change anyway. Where I am today is not where I pictured myself being ten years ago, and I'm sure the same applies to most people. Even if you could picture where you want to be in ten years, it's unlikely that's exactly where you'll be. 

You're doing really well just by being here right now. And the fact you've been doing DBT for 6 whole months is an achievement. Well done."	Tall_Ad109	reply	na	na	na	0.9984276294708252	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Since I need guideposts with abstract concepts, I find ways to break it down in a more concrete way.  

 I found a list of core values online and chose ten of the most important to me.  

Journal prompts with concrete self-discovery questions helped, too. Do you want kids?  Apartment in the city or house in the country?  Do you believe in God?  Do you like real books or a tablet? 

Would You Rather questions

 Listing  some life goals. 

I got a book at Barnes and Noble last week called This is Me 1001 Questions to Learn More About Yourself.  

Knowing what we like and dislike, want and don't want makes it easier to envision the life worth living. Like, if someone realizes they don't want kids and want to live in the country, prefers a crossover to a truck, likes to knit, and values community and spirituality...they can build a life worth living by making choices in alignment with those things.

Things got better for me when I stopped letting the bad days consume me. We will always have bad days and good days, life is a series of ebbs and flows. I think the trick to it is to just accept it for what it is. Example, when I used to call in sick to work because I needed a mental health day I would spend the entire day feeling like shit because I didn’t do anything. I would feel like I was “wasting” that day. I could never get comfortable or enjoy my day in anyway, I would make myself feel worse and would not get any rest. Fast forward to now, I accept that some days I NEED to do nothing, and I need to not feel bad about it. When I feel bad about it, that day IS wasted. It’s okay to not be “on” every day, it’s okay to not have the energy to do your daily tasks, it’s okay. Don’t push yourself, just accept it and know that tomorrow is a new day. It’s okay to try again tomorrow, it’s normal. It does not take away from your progress or success! It just means you are human. Choose to allow yourself the space to do nothing, or to feel depressed and low energy, or whatever. And then on the days you feel good? Go hard. Work for it. Know that anything is possible, and you can have and achieve all your goals - and know that rest is okay, bad days are okay. Everything will be okay in the end ❤️ feel better.

"A life worth living doesn’t mean you’re constantly happy and doing Meaningful Things™️.

It means a life without the wild rollercoaster of emotions. More like smooth and steady. There will be the occasional rough seas, squalls, or storms, and your DBT skills are the ship and crew that will get you to the other side whole. 

A life worth living is one where YOU decide the best course, not whatever random emotion you’re having at the time feels. 

A life worth living is one where you finally understand you’re not a monster and you stop burying yourself in the emotional and/or physical self-harm that accompanies that devastating shame we heap on ourselves. 

A life worth living means living life effectively. It doesn’t mean there won’t be unhappiness or hard times. It means you’ll be able to deal with those times with a clearer head and a tool belt of skills that allow you to handle whatever happens in the most effective way possible. So instead of derailing your life, you’re able to cope and then find your way back to “normal.”"	Tall_Ad109	reply	na	na	na	0.9984276294708252	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"It’s not something that’s discussed as “self-harm” as such very often yet, but it is a term I’ve heard/seen and I can provide some articles on it. 

For me, emotional self-harm is mostly when I beat myself up or absolutely flay myself with negative self-talk. For instance, saying things to myself like“I’m a loser,” “I’m a monster who doesn’t deserve to live”, “I’m fucking stupid and fat and ugly and should have never been born”. 

Then there’s the repeated emotional patterns in our lives, our maladaptive reactions and the warped lenses we see situations through, that can lead to repeated cycles of us inflicting emotional abuse on ourselves.

"Hello, everyone! 

&#x200B;

tldr: I just finished covering the Mindfulness section on my own and wanted to share some reflections. 

&#x200B;

I decided to go through Marsha Linehan's DBT Workbook (2nd ed) by myself mid-February this year. It was prompted by a breakup, which was partly caused by my lack of emotion regulation skills. Before the breakup, I dipped my toes into the workbook here and there without ever committing to go through it systematically or daily. Working through the workbook on my own has become a nice self-development project of some sort, and it's been great. 

&#x200B;

Here's the schedule I set up for myself: 

* mid-Feb to June: learn the basics of the DBT & cover the mindfulness module. 
* July to September: Cover the emotion regulation module.
* October to December:  Cover the distress tolerance module
* January 2024 to March 2024: Cover the interpersonal effectiveness module

&#x200B;

To be honest, setting up the schedule this way might not be for everyone. Linehan notes in the Training Manual that it's generally not a good idea to spend many weeks for one module because some people may dislike a particular module (e.g., I'm dreading to cover the interpersonal effectiveness module), and staying in the module that you don't like for a long time may cause the loss of motivation. 

&#x200B;

That being said, though, I find 13 weeks to be also kind of not enough to thoroughly cover each module? Each module contains so much information and learning, so I kind of found no space to take a break even though I was taking 13 weeks to go through the Mindfulness module. 

&#x200B;

For materials, I bought the following publications by Linehan: 

* Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of Borderline Personality 
* DBT Skills Training Manual Second Edition
* DBT® Skills Training Handouts and Worksheets, Second Edition Second Edition

&#x200B;

I bought the first book because I wanted to do the deepest dive into the DBT, but it was not that helpful, to be honest. The first section where Linehan presents the bio-social theory and various causes of BPD was informative but also triggering. The section about sexual abuse, invalidating environment, etc. reminded me so much of my painful upbringing, but I also think it was worth pushing through and reading them. I wanted to understand myself better. It's a very technical, academic book, and I'm an academic, so I enjoyed her clear, scientific writing, but it might not be for everyone. 

The part about therapist-client relationship wasn't all that relevant for me since I'm doing DBT on my own, but Linehan does talk about therapy-interfering behaviors \*on the part of the therapist\* and I thought that section taught me what kind of therapists to avoid. She essentially gives a list of therapist red flags, so I thought that was helpful. 

&#x200B;

The second book (Training Manual) was so worth the money!!! And if you're doing DBT alone, I'd highly recommend buying the training manual. The beginning part provides a lot of basic theories behind DBT and a sample DBT program schedule. I skipped the parts about how to manage the therapist-client relationships, the DBT group dynamics, etc. The latter 2/3 of the book contains detailed explanations for each DBT concept, handout and worksheet, and I found them SO VALUABLE! I want to thank the person on this sub who recommended me to buy the Training Manual a while ago!!! 

&#x200B;

Some reflections after going through the mindfulness module: 

&#x200B;

I thought the mindfulness module was SUPER HELPFUL, and, according to the Training Manual, the observe & describe skills as well as being one-mindful and non-judgmental are necessary for the emotion regulation skills, so I'm glad that I was able to cover them well before moving onto the emotion regulation module. 

&#x200B;

Practicing mindfulness almost everyday definitely changed my life. I feel less depressed, and I started paying more attention to what's going on in my life and living in the present moment as it is, so to speak. Loving Kindness Meditation especially normalized expressing compassion to myself, which I wasn't used to, and I plan to do it everyday for the rest of my life. 

&#x200B;

It was also fun to do many mindfulness activities and to figure out what works well for me vs doesn't work well for me. For instance, I'm not a big fan of the stone flake meditation but I really like the staircase meditation. I think one big benefit of the workbook offering so many activities is that it gives you an arsenal of mindfulness toolkits and help you figure out what works well for you. 

&#x200B;

One worry I have about the mindfulness module is that it might not be for neurodivergent folks. I know someone who has ADHD, and he tells me he really struggles with meditation, etc., so for neurodivergent people, they might have to do some additional research/ reading to figure out ways to practice mindfulness. 

&#x200B;

One final thought: while mindfulness is SO tremendously helpful, I also noticed that it's not a solution for everything. For instance, while I was covering the mindfulness module, I had a conflict with a friend of mine and got kind of verbally aggressive, which I regret and apologized for. The conflict reminded me that I need to learn emotional regulation and interpersonal effectiveness skills. So, I'm excited to move onto the emotion regulation module and learn more. 

&#x200B;

I hope this post was helpful for those who are looking to start DBT on their own!

"I’ve had a very stressful last few months, with working 9 hour days and travelling a lot in the weekends. Then my sibling was the victim of a threatened violent crime (they’re fine, just traumatised) and my own C-PTSD got badly triggered when something I have a phobia about happened to my girlfriend and their health was in danger (they are also fine, although it shook them up really badly too). I’m also sick with bronchitis that won’t go away.

I started DBT for my bipolar about five years ago, and after two years of it I’ve had a solid grasp of the principles, I’ve changed my thinking because of it and I practice my skills regularly. But now with all these vulnerabilities I’ve been finding it so hard to practice the skills and ways of thinking. I keep acting out of emotional mind, and it’s scaring me because it makes things worse for me and soon I might start unintentionally hurting other people too. And it’s super weird because I usually lie in rational mind rather than emotional mind when I’m not in wise mind.

Does anyone have any advice for how to get back into the flow of acting skilfully? I’m thinking maybe I need to get into first-aid type distress tolerance skills for a while before I’ll be able to get out of emotional mind, and then I can start thinking logically. It’s hard though, but I think even writing this out has helped."	Competitive_World_27	post	16.30236512258597	female	White	0.9884864091873169	na	na	na	1	dbtselfhelp
"I think you answered your own question there :) First, give yourself some patience because you aren’t doing something wrong and you haven’t backslid- you’ve encountered some real challenges and your brain is doing what it does. But you already know you need to fall back, repractice things you maybe haven’t needed to think about in a long time. 

Make sure you’re giving your body what it needs to feel centered, too- sleep, water, decent if not perfect eating habits. Shower, brush your teeth, if those things are challenges for you when compromised. 

Then rely on what you’ve spent several years studying and you’ll find your way back."	Competitive_World_27	reply	na	na	na	0.9884864091873169	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
I have a habit of torturing myself with my negative self talk. I know logically that that what I'm doing is not helpful, but that idea that I'm just an awful person who doesn't deserve to feel better or that, by making myself feel better I'm being disingenuous because I'm a bad person and should be punished, thus trying to make myself feel better makes me an even worse person (etc), this all makes me feel like i deserve to be miserable. Logically I know I should reach for my skills, but sometimes I'm just so deep in my pain that I don't think I deserve it. How do I use my skills when I don't think I deserve them? Is there a skill I'm missing or forgetting to help with this exact problem, so I can move past it and use others?	saintswitchblade	post	12.482553844287837	female	White	0.9967094659805298	na	na	na	7	dbtselfhelp

"As a fellow self-hater, I can empathize, OP. I have bipolar so at my worst, I hear voices telling me to kill myself, and sometimes I'm so convinced the universe is out to get me I close all blinds and don't come out of my blankets for days. 

As someone who deals with similarly extreme bouts of self-hatred, there are a few skills I think are useful. For my psychosis, I take the meds I'm supposed to, but it also helps to ride the (STUN) wave: this too shall pass--the voices, the feeling of self hatred, and the terror that comes with it. If you know there are moments you won't feel as bad anymore, it's okay to let yourself feel bad, as long as you're preparing in ways you can for when you feel better (for me, it's taking my meds, but for you, it might be doing whatever little thing like brushing your teeth, showering, taking a 10 minute walk, etc). When it's this bad, basically I'm trying not to kill myself, so distress tolerance is critical--something as simple as STOP so that you're not actively self harming is better than nothing. 

Going off of that, I think half smiling and willing hands is also useful. Personally, when I wallow when I'm *not* psychotic, I'm being willful: I *could* practice my skills to feel better, but I'm *choosing* not to use them. 

I'm not sure if this applies to you, but honestly, a lot of the time when I wallow, it's because I feel invalidated in some way: maybe I feel like a loved one isn'y properly understanding my pain, so I lash out and purposely sabotage myself in order to show other people how much they're hurting me. If there are other causes like that, I'd also make sure you're addressing those issues of external invalidation. 

Finally, the most important skills of all are radical acceptance and self-compassion (i.e. loving kindness toward oneself). Radical acceptance that the world gifted you DBT, worthy or unworthy. Self-compassion to recognize that every person is deserving of dignity and love, even you. I have a poster up saying something like, ""may I always be surrounded by the people I love."" I'd find some loving kindness mantras that speak to you and put them up where you see them all the time. Learning to love myself isn't something I've mastered yet, but small steps bring me closer everyday. 

Sending loving kindness, OP. May you receive the love you deserve."	saintswitchblade	reply	na	na	na	0.9967094659805298	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
My word, can I relate? 100%. Have you done distress tolerance module yet? Have you done the mindfulness module? Both of those are super helpful for people like us. The best things that snap me out that mode is unpleasant distractions. I don’t want a fucking bath and hot tea. Bite into a lemon, shovel snow, hold an ice pack to your face, do 20 jumping jacks…etc. something that engages the monkey brain and give it something to do. Then once sufficiently distracted I choose which skill to use for that moment-one thing at a time, deep breathing, etc.	saintswitchblade	reply	na	na	na	0.9967094659805298	weak	strong	strong	na	dbtselfhelp
"I don’t think that the concept of “deserving” is helpful. I would try to reframe that in terms of feelings — do a STUN wave (sensations, thoughts, urges, Name the emotion — look at the emotion sheets in the Emotion Regulation module — and ride the wave) and say to yourself, “I am feeling shame.” or whatever you are feeling. Then check the facts on that emotion. Does it fit the facts? Is it justified? Is it effective? 

Also, “worse person,” “awful person,” etc are judgements. I’d practice non-judgementalness as well (a mindfulness skill). Try to just describe the facts. “I did x.” “I saw y.” “I heard z.” 

Too deep in the pain to use skills? Try willingness — half smile and willing hands. 

Also, consider “screw” — the options you have: 

Solve the problem

Change your relationship to the problem 

Radically accept

Entertain misery

Worsen the situation"	saintswitchblade	reply	na	na	na	0.9967094659805298	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Hi, fellow self hater.

A lot of stuff has been clicking into place for me lately in terms of mindfulness. I had a series of traumatic events that resulted in losing access to the social circle that had been my whole life for a couple years. 

It's been almost two months since it ended, and I sometimes feel like I'm thinking about it nonstop. I'm an analyzer. I have to put everything under a mental microscope. This time, I'm able to actually do mindfulness. I notice that I'm starting to think about what happened. Sometimes, I'm angry at what happened. Sometimes, I'm lonely when I think about the friends I lost. Sometimes, I just want to cry and cry until I disappear because all my worst fears were co-

And then I stop, remember I'm typing up a report and what was that word I was trying to remember again?

If it feels like a productive or new thought, and I'm not doing anything higher priority, I will sit for a while and turn it over in my hands until I start repeating myself. Then I move on. 

It has helped more than I can describe. I still don't love myself. But because I'm not reliving the trauma and festering in the bad feelings. Yesterday, I felt lonely and sad and I let myself cry because it sucks. Then I got some water and sat back down to refocus on my book. 

If you're not ready to love yourself yet, I think that's ok. Focus instead on doing something. Just think about that. Refuse to think the thoughts until it gets easier. Even if those thoughts are about how much you don't like yourself. At least you'll be able to get the thoughts out then go about getting something done.

"DBT is not about feeling better. It’s about effectively coping with life. There are no modules in DBT devoted to being happy. The modules are devoted to learning, developing, and practicing emotional and behavioral regulation skills that help you effectively navigate your own thoughts, personal situations, crises, and life in general. 

Sometimes, handling things effectively does help you feel better. But that is a side effect of using the skills, not the end goal of using the skills. 

So it’s not about deserving anything. It’s about learning how to self-regulate so that you are not only a better member of society, but so you’re able to manage your own life as effectively as possible."	saintswitchblade	reply	na	na	na	0.9967094659805298	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Have you heard of ice dives yet?? If not, that’s a pretty awesome one. :D You can also do it with one of those instant ice packs if you don’t have ice and water available! 

I’m also a fan of running up and down stairs or doing jumping jacks for Intense exercise for TIPP!

And this is not exactly DBT, but using coordinated movement like dancing, balancing on one foot, or playing catch is super helpful for dissociation!

Those are all in TIPP. But I love so many of the skills that it would be hard to choose just one lol — but I’d say that opposite action, especially to fear and shame, has helped me a ton, and radical acceptance / checking the facts / self validation / non-judgementalness / observe and describe.

The only in-person programs in my area with the therapy, group, and homework...are either too pricey, out of network, or waitlisted for just therapy with someone certified in DBT.

I was recently enlightened to dialectical behavioral therapy.com and that has been a game changer. I know there are workbooks out there, but I haven't looked into that as of yet. 

I am planning on compiling some sort of mental health play book if you will..maybe to be published...idk we will see. My psychiatrist has inspired me to want to help others in some way because of ""the progress I have made in the amount of time I have made it"" she said not many of her patients have been as successful as I have been on this healing journey with coping and being in the present moment.

"hi all. I’m really struggling and need some support with the decision to leave DBT :(

I’ve been in intensive DBT for 3 months. i’m learning so much, but it’s definitely making me notice my BPD more and act more “BPD” than i did when i would constantly ignore my symptoms. I’ve also become extremely codependent on my therapist. this is obviously unhealthy and all very upsetting to me. 

There are no jobs where I live and I feel like my life is on pause for the next year because of DBT, which is why i’m thinking of quitting.

the main motivation to quit is that i live with my parents in an abusive household (mum is the abuser, dad is my biggest supporter and my rock. it’s a weird combination that makes leaving very hard). anyway, the abuse is now so bad that i impulsively decided to apply for jobs in a city 300 miles away from home, meaning it would be impossible to carry on with my DBT (it isn’t offered remotely). 

now i have a job that starts in september…. but i don’t actually want the job. when i think about it, i kinda want to curl up and die. the salary is less than minimum wage and i can’t survive on it in the city i’ll be moving to. i was just so desperate to escape. my friends are all saying that i need to get away from my abusive home. my dad and my therapist are very concerned because i haven’t finished DBT yet. i have no idea what to do. i’m so distressed and i can’t access my “wise mind”, i’m just crying constantly and having panic attacks.

now i’m in the horrible position of realising that i’m in no fit state mentally to move out and work full time and also i don’t really want to, but if i stay and finish DBT, i have to live with my evil abusive monster of a mother.

i’m really struggling with this decision. if i go, i lose my entire support system and the therapy i’ve waited years for and have to work a job for shit pay, but at least i’ll be free of the abuse. if i stay, i get to keep the therapy which is saving my life, but have to live with the horrible woman who’s destroying my life at the same time with her narcissistic abuse.

please send help, i have no idea what to do and i can’t stop crying. i can’t believe i’m so stupid, i feel like I’m falling apart 😢"	strawbeylamb	post	18.30004052032832	female	White	0.9973358511924744	na	na	na	22	dbtselfhelp
"i doubt you are acting more bpd, but rather using mindfulness has made you aware of how unhealthy your behaviors are. you arent ignoring it like before, you are paying attention to it all now.

ending therapy will likely cause no change in your behaviors, leaving you to continue behaving in ineffective ways. If you seriously need to move, get a DBT program ready to transfer to when you do.

"Hey just reading back your post let's try using the Check the Facts skill

- the thought of the new job makes you want to curl up an die 
- you can't afford to live if you move and take the job 
- you'd be moving away from your dad and support systems 
- you made the decision to move impulsively and acknowledge you did it without thinking it through
- you acknowledge DBT is helping and people you trust are worried about you quitting half way through 
- you won't be able to access DBT support remotely 
- your living environment is abusive and unfair 
- your relationship with your therapist needs stronger boundaries 

Now try doing a Pros and Cons list. 
List ALL the facts and ALL the pros and cons of moving or staying. If you stay what are the Positives and what are the Negatives. If you leave what are the Positives and what are the Negatives. 
Be honest with yourself and list ONLY Facts not emotions or beliefs. 

You may need to practice Radical Acceptance as well, as this is a decision which seems to have no 'perfect' outcome. Life is often like this and BPD usually causes people to see life as very Black and White, so when faced with a decision where there is no 'perfect' outcome we choose one and just go for it without thinking. 

Use your mindfulness and use your skills and Radically Accept that no matter what you choose you're going to have to go through difficult times to get to the reward at the end. 
You can do this! Good luck!

Edited to add - you aren't stupid at all! You have BPD and an abusive household environment. You can't be expected to have the skills to navigate this situation UNTIL you are taught them!

i think leaving therapy isnt a good option, youre gonna be putting yourself in a much worse position navigating living in a new place without any support from your therapist. i would recommend looking into financial support if you can since dbt is considered a pretty disabling condition and disability might be an option depending on where you live and then you could look into getting your own place with roommates or something nearby for cheap. but even if its not an option i definitely cant recommend putting yourself in such a scary position even with an abusive mom altho i know it must be really tough. i hope you can manage to navigate this if it feels overwhelming maybe your therapist or dad can help you look into better options that can keep you close while still being away from your mom. take care things will get better	strawbeylamb	reply	na	na	na	0.9973358511924744	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Honestly, it's only been 3 months you say you've been in therapy, and 3 months for this therapy isn't enough time from my experience to just quit and not get anything out of it. Stick with the program for as long as you're able. Housing wise I would just practice what coping skills you are learning, get into the employment situation, improve your situation with actual problem solving skills to financially stabilize yourself to find somewhere else later on. 

Sometimes the toughest things in life are what help us grow, and this situation maybe one of them, but in the end how you choose to respond and where your actions lead will determine more than what your household does or what other people may say or do to impact things. DBT is a skills thing where you just gotta keep it going, and when the programs over, you still gotta keep going and practice and learn them till they are mentally engrained. That's what retraining your thinking and how you behave works. It sucks, I've been through something similar (not family but more like less desirable roommates who were unhealthy to live with after a nasty divorce), and like mentioned, it's all about toughing it out to improve your own mental state to then later problem solve to get into a better situation. If I had quit my DBT when I was in the midst of hard times, things would of been a lot worse because I wouldn't have honed in on the skills I know today still. And I wouldn't be where I am today either so it's a silver lining in the midst of the crappy situation that I stuck with it till the very tough end. Keep going, wishin you the best and keep going.

"this was posted a couple weeks ago and you've already gotten a ton of great advice and support from other people, but I just wanted to say that I understand how it feels to so, so badly need to leave a deeply unhealthy home situation. it wasn't as abusive as you have described, but it was a situation that I had wanted to leave for many years, and over the pandemic it just reached a point where it was making it impossible for me to be in a good place mentally.

the main thing I just want to make sure you understand is that you're not wrong for wanting to leave, and you should leave as soon as it's a good idea. I agree with others that staying in therapy for a little longer is probably the best thing to do, but please don't feel stupid for trying to get out of an abusive home, or even for feeling unsure about it. it's not an easy thing to do, especially when you have some support around you that you don't want to leave. it's also scary to move so far even for someone not in an abusive situation/struggling with mental health.

I'm sorry that it's not yet a good time for that - I understand how that feels, and all I can say is that you will be able to get out. learning DBT skills and incorporating them into your life will serve you for a very long time, and I think they will be really helpful during and after your eventual move, so as hard as it is, keep engaging with therapy and leaning on any support that you have. ❤️ as others have said, it seems like DBT may be helping you become more aware of your actions. that can be difficult if you're judging yourself for those actions, but that awareness is ultimately extremely important and shows your progress."	strawbeylamb	reply	na	na	na	0.9973358511924744	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"narcissism and BPD trigger each other greatly. if you can figure out how to tolerate your mom's bullshit, validate yourself, and walk away, she can't do shit to you. Their primary means of control is making you doubt your experience as they rewrite their ""really good person"" psychosis narrative and gaslight you and say you were the one that behaved poorly. the only solution ive found is walk away.

Of course it makes you sad to stay in an unhappy environment, but maybe the best way out of the bad situation is to build yourself a really strong foundation of healthy coping skills and emotional resilience. You're more likely to succeed in building the life you want with those skills. I think Distress Tolerance will be really helpful to you.

" I'm currently attending a DBT group at the same clinic where I see my individual therapist (since it's required). The thing is, it's not doing anything for me. During the last 6 months we've changed instructors 3 times.

The first one was extremely aggressive and would constantly argue with some members for not doing their homework or showing up late (making them publicly apologize or kicking them out of the virtual room for that day). He was my individual therapist too and I was on the verge of leaving the clinic, but then he got fired so I guess it worked out. 

The second was the most monotone instructor I've had since first year of college. She was the opposite of the first one and just read the book for the entirety of the hour. She never motivated us to do our homework and eventually it got to the point where I was the only one doing them, so I stopped. She didn't get fired but stopped giving group the days I was scheduled. 

The new guy is nice. He's extremely shy and goes off on tangents when he uses his own life as examples because no one is speaking. Again, no one is doing their homework and he's not really urging us to participate either. I would talk in the beginning, but eventually stopped when I realized no one was listening or simply had their cameras off.

Group lately has been feeling like a huge waste of time, but I don't miss it to avoid the fee. I also can't stop going since it's required to remain in individual therapy with the clinic (and I really like my new therapist). 

Are there any online resources for DBT? As in courses or online groups that can be out-of-state. I'm going to keep attending my current group but it might as well not be a thing since I'm getting absolutely nothing out of it."

"Can you switch groups? Not sure if you live in a city, but I've lived in several different midsize-big cities throughout the US and found that most will have multiple DBT groups to choose from. 

Alternatively, I found that there are a limited number of DBT groups that are held online. Personally I find online groups slightly less effective, but you should be able to find the DBT group therapists that are licensed for your state on Psychology Today. Even if they don't have a group running now, reach out and ask when the next group starts--if they don't run a continuous group, a lot of therapists will be able to let you know when the next available course starts. 

I agree that your group leaders sound like they're not great at interpersonal management. Unfortunately, DBT is usually only as effective as its instructors. Best of luck finding a new group!

Edit: saw why you can't switch groups, sorry. Yeah, I'd try to find another online group to join if your insurance is willing to cover 2 groups at once. Honestly, with how often your clinic makes you switch therapists, I would question whether they would make you switch again, but I agree that having a good connection with one's therapist is important. I'd definitely consider the pros and cons of leaving the clinic altogether and trying to find a relatively good individual + group therapist (rather than a terrible group leader and great personal therapist), but ultimately that decision is up to you. Additionally, if you really learn better with your individual therapist, dropping group is also an option. I'd normally advise against that, but having such an unstable leadership for group reeks of bad management, and that's not a place I'd want to be at, so individual therapy with a DBT clinician you love may actually be more effective.

"I recently began a romantic relationship after 2 years of being single. I have had about 1 1/2 years of my BPD symptoms being under such good control that I would consider myself in remission.

Well, it turns out that because I’ve been avoiding romantic connections, the symptoms are still there in romantic relationships, which makes sense because I haven’t really done any work on that area of my life. 

The biggest thing I’ve struggled with is the feeling that doing anything “wrong” will cause me to be abandoned. So I agonize over my behavior, things said via text message, and when I feel I’m being ignored via text message. 

I know I have a lot of trouble with telling people what I need, as well as projecting my past experiences onto my current situation. 

What are some skills to help me?

I’ve come up with a cope ahead plan, which I just started using, and I’m unsure as of yet if it is helping. 

The emotional activation is so difficult to manage, but I know it is important to do this, to show myself that I can navigate romantic relationships instead of avoid them."	Turbulent_String6445	post	27.647614609821346	female	White	0.07065440714359283	na	na	na	5	dbtselfhelp
There are articles/worksheets delineating DBT skills that can be used for effective interpersonal relationship skills. I definitely think emotional regulation and cope ahead will help.

"It’s a radical acceptance thing, I think. To be in a romantic relationship accepts that you are looking for an intimate and vulnerable connection. To do this effectively you give control to someone else and that is really fucking scary. Because they could leave, that’s their prerogative. 

So I just try and remind myself to be myself, that I’m an acquired taste, and that I will be okay without them.m should this relationship not work. If that last statement isn’t true (the wise mind is honest) then it’s back to the drawing board. Usually that drawing board points to the past and I find myself reminding myself that most romantic relationships don’t end in you finding your “forever person.” To go out and practice, assuming you’re not hurting anyone in doing it, is worth it!

"For the past fifty years, my daily life resembled what you are currently experiencing. I lived in a world without meaning or purpose, and experienced deep depression. My depression was emotional and physical. My mind usually continued to operate quickly and clearly, but at my worst, I was wrapped in cognitive distortions. I thought of suicide at least once a day and often more.

One day, I realized that ***meaning is overrated***.

I can survive perfectly well without attempting to attach meaning to anything or anyone. I'm not always able to achieve non-attachment for more than a few seconds, and I generally have to remind myself to simply observe.

If everything is meaningless, how is my desperation any different? I like to think of myself as an intelligent, rational person guided by the scientific method, so, since my desperation is just as pointless as anything else, it is delusional to continue to desperately want things to have meaning. Since there's no sense to keep fighting, so the best option is to declare victory and go home..

I also find it worth remembering that it's essentially impossible for us to do anything except attach meaning to everything ourselves. I have opted to reject the idea of meaning itself, but even if I didn't, assigning meaning would be a pointless exercise. 

So, in addition to facing psychological and philosophical meaninglessness, we have to accept the meaninglessness of physical experience. Our senses are extremely limited and flawed. Cognition is essentially an attempt to make sense of the trickle of unrelated information the universe presents to us. Our sense organs simply aren't up to the task, and that's probably a good thing. In 1881, the psychologist William James explained it beautifully:

""We have no organ or faculty to appreciate the simply given order. The real world as it is given at this moment is the sum total of all its beings and events now. But can we think of such a sum? Can we realize for an instant what a cross-section of all existence at a definite point of time would be? While I talk and the flies buzz, a sea gull catches a fish at the mouth of the Amazon, a tree falls in the Adirondack wilderness, a man sneezes in Germany, a horse dies in Tartary, and twins are born in France. What does that mean? Does the contemporaneity of these events with each other and with a million more as disjointed as they form a rational bond between them, and unite them into anything that means for us a world? Yet just such a collateral contemporaneity, and nothing else, is the real order of the world. It is an order with which we have nothing to do but to get away from it as fast as possible. As I said, we break it: we break it into histories, and we break it into arts, and we break it into sciences; and then we begin to feel at home. We make ten thousand separate serial orders of it. On any one of these, we may react as if the rest did not exist. We discover among its parts regulations that were never given to sense at all, --mathematical relations, tangents, squares, and roots and logarithmic functions, -- and out of an infinite number of these we call certain ones essential and lawgiving, and ignore the rest. Essential these relations are, but only for our purpose.""

Anyway, eventually, I began to read the classic Buddhist texts, meditate and practice in my own way. I also began working on myself using a variety of supervised and unsupervised therapeutic treatments. Together, they're working amazingly well. I am now usually a fairly contented nihilist.

"I saw from your posts that you’re going through heartbreak. Having an FP is like an addiction; your brain is so attuned to the intense sensations of getting attention from and getting rejected by your FP, so everything else feels dull.

If you treat your breakup like kicking an addiction and stop seeing your FP, your brain will eventually reset itself. You will begin to find joy in the many small, varied pleasures in life. It may take a long time to get there. Recovering from a break up can be an ugly journey. You’ll learn things about yourself and pick up some helpful tools along the way.

Your physical illness may be caused by anxiety. High stress hormones can make you nauseous. The most constructive way to lower stress hormones is to physically tire yourself out. Intense physical activity is best, if you have a sport you enjoy. Otherwise, just walking can help a lot too.

That said, as I understand it, existentialism is a response to meaninglessness, and that response takes an approach that resembles the theoretical basis of my nihilism. Whereas I believe that meaning is an impossibility in any larger sense, the existentialists believe that we can and should create meaning for ourselves, based on the actions we take.

If you think existentialism-inspired psychotherapy might interest you, I suggest reading Viktor E. Frankl's [*Man's Search for Meaning*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27s_Search_for_Meaning)*.*"	polipioo	reply	na	na	na	0.9969344139099121	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Acceptance is usually the first step in DBT, as in radically (deeply) surrender to the facts of your life as it is right now. Acceptance then gives you the basic ground from which to begin choosing your next steps—choosing the next step according to what is the  most effective thing to do in that moment. 

Easier said than done. “Behavior changes first” was a dbt concept that made a whole metric ton of difference to me. I had been waiting years for therapy to make me _feel_ like behaving differently. Then I realized from DBT that changing the way I was going about life would possibly lead to changed feelings. 

My great grandmother said to my mom—when you wake up, get up. And when you get up, do something. This was the mantra that got my great grandmother through the loss of her 2 year old son to diphtheria in 1926And the death of her daughter in 1948 due to overdose of anesthesia. 

Your pain is real. Your behavior around the pain can also be something you uncouple from the pain. Don’t wait until you _feel like_ doing the next effective thing. You will wait a long time.

"I know that feeling well, and I know it is painful. I am feeling it right now actually…I guess what I am doing is tolerating distress, one of the dbt skills for intense emotions. I feel a sense of meaninglessness right now because my spouse of 20 years is divorcing me and so sometimes my mood takes me to this bottomless cup place (I like your description!). I feel afraid that I won’t be able to ever be happy again…it occurs to me that happiness or joy is the stuff that gives meaning to life, so no wonder I feel the meaninglessness or the bottomless pit feeling. Put it another way, I feel like the pain I am and will be going through will not ever end—and this is a horrifying thing to fear.

ETA meanwhile I try to “act as if” I won’t be unhappy forever, and I won’t be annihilated by this loss, because i “act as if” I do have a meaningful existence without this person by my side. The feelings are sometimes very overwhelming 

Meanwhile, intellectually i know this person has been emotionally low key abusive and just basically unkind and selfish for the latter half of the marriage, and so logically I must conclude I will be better off. But there’s the original wounded part of me—CPTSD from childhood neglect and abandonment —that doesn’t really fall in line with the intellectual knowing. In fact that part seemingly doesn’t want to hear from my intellectual side at all. This disconnect is how the pain keeps going.

# Any ideas for very precise opposite actions for the urge to take a nap?

My depression is very physical and catatonic, I want to sleep at all times. Even when not in a depressive episode I struggle to avoid wanting to sleep at least portions of the day. Finding opposite actions (VERY opposite ones) that truly keep me away from the bed has been challenging. Leaving the house would be ideal but I live in Iceland - a very grey and rainy climate - and outdoors is often unappealing and a huge deterrent."	thotbot88	post	33.207576842711276	female	White	0.002095166128128767	na	na	na	5	dbtselfhelp
"Opposite action is important, but I just wanted to make sure that you've established that it's **absolutely not** a physical issue? 

I'm just saying that because DBT can help, but it won't if it's a physical issue that can only be solved with medication. For example, for someone experiencing psychosis, medication is generally preferable to DBT, because DBT will alleviate symptoms but won't treat the root psychopharmacological cause. Similarly, if your need for naps is because your body physically needs that sleep, DBT won't resolve the underlying issue--you may need to adjust your medication to include something that increases your energy significantly (wellbutrin is often used for that purpose in conjunction with a mood stabilizer/antipsychotic for bipolar people) or even visit a sleep specialist. 

If you're sure this is purely a matter of will, then I recommend exercise. Not only has exercise been proven to regulate people's sleep better, but it's also been proven to regulate your energy and mood throughout the day, and ironically, you may be more energized post exercise. I recommend choosing something you'll find fun--playing dance dance revolution, for example. 

I think it would also help to make sure you're not near the bed when you want to nap the most. Maybe pick up volunteering or a part time job that you can schedule to meet specifically around the time you'd normally sleep? Or another activity that forces you out of the house at that time--a class of some sort, a community club, etc."	thotbot88	reply	na	na	na	0.002095166128128767	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Have you talked to a doctor about your sleep? 
I experience Narcolepsy which is very connected to emotions in the sense that they make me feel tired the more intense and can trigger cataplexy episodes. If you are following abc please, getting 7-8hrs sleep uninterrupted and waking up feeling groggy as hell instead of refreshed, I would like to point out that it is not *normal* to feel like that. Especially if your relying on caffeine or nicotine or some kind of stimulant to get through the day and it’s not effective in healthy quantities. 

That being said, first off I’d suggest making sure you have a strict sleep schedule, go to bed at the same time, wake up at the same time. 
Secondly I’d like to recommend that you get vitamin D in your day so pick a slot that you are normally active and maintain it. Go for a walk around the block and throw on some headphones to listen to a podcast, audiobook or music. Dbt and me is a good podcast on Spotify or Apple Podcasts to start with, since your posting here. 
Practice active meditation, as in do something simple that keeps you moving and try to pay attention to the tiny details in your environment for your senses to pick up on. 

I work of a principal of my brain is gaslighting me. I can acknowledge that I am tired and need to rest, but I don’t sleep.

"Hey OP,

First of all, I want to give you the biggest internet hugs, and give you my story to let you know that all is not lost. I flunked out of school twice because of my mental illness--once in high school, and another time in college. Both times, I also lost my housing and had to couch surf. The good news is, after I worked various minimum wage jobs for several years, I managed to re-apply, get a scholarship for late college goers, and finish college. I'm now on track for a PhD in a very well regarded program in my field, which wasn't at all what my career ambitions were, but I'm doing so much better than at my worst. I want to validate that what you're going through sucks, and you may be correct that you need to take a very long detour. But I can almost guarantee that if you have will, there is a way. Was I happy being nearly a decade older than the freshmen in my uni program? No, it felt weird as all hell. It wasn't what I wanted for my college experience, and I felt like a failure, but *done is good enough*. 

For skills, I agree with u/Sensitive-Sorbet917 that distress tolerance is paramount. 

That being said, being homeless is no joke, and I highly recommend trying to use your skills to hope for the best while also preparing for the worst. If you have a strong family or friend network, I highly recommend leaning on them for now. Since you say you may be homeless, I assume your family can't support you. In that case, I strongly suggest trying to come up with some couch surfing arrangements with your friends to tide you over until you can get a sublease (easier than a lease, though obviously a lease is ideal). I would also make sure that you can continue DBT or some form of therapy--is there a community health center nearby? Often they provide therapy for free. There are some other options for lower income folks, including programs with financial aid. If you live in CA or MA (and a few other states; maybe NY?), you can apply for free state healthcare coverage (to clarify, it's only free if you make poverty-level income) which is actually quite strong, and will cover therapy. Finally, I would try to find a minimum wage job; I personally recommend the food/bev industry because when I first became homeless, I quite literally couldn't afford to eat. Working at a restaurant meant I got some sort of meal at least once a day for 5-6 days/week, and usually some food at the end of the day that I could take home instead of throwing away. 

Finally, I want to emphasize self compassion. You are not a failure: this is just a stumble in a very long road. I hope you can access your wise mind and dialectics to realize that it's not all over; there will almost certainly be a chance to go to college again, whether through night classes, scholarships, or various programs to support adults pursuing college degrees. I'm sending you all the loving kindness. May you be safe and healthy. May you be surrounded by love. May you find the happiness you deserve."

"Thank you so much for this. I'm in the UK, so some things are a little different. I am already in my 30's and have been trying to get this degree for many years and had set back after set back due to my MH. Thankfully, with the NHS, my DBT is free, so I don't need to worry about not being able to continue with that. But when it comes to housing, subletting isn't really a thing over here, it's illegal for most tenancy contracts and so people just don't do it. You're right with what you said about family though, the relationships are very tricky and I absolutely could not live with them.

As for going back to college, my worry is that if I am kicked out now, because of how fees are funded in the UK, I won't get funding to be able to go back and finish my degree, or any other for that matter, and finding an employer willing to sponsor me can be nigh on impossible. 

It all just feels so stressful. I just want to be at uni, get my degree and start working."	Tall_Ad109	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9959232807159424	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Hi OP,  I am quite new on my DBT journey but I just wanted to offer some thoughts as someone else in the UK who went through something very similar. So not so much coping skills but just general things that might help right now, just to add to the great advice above.

Firstly I am sorry this is happening, I understand how stressful and hard it is. I was made homeless in July 2020, so during covid restrictions, also as a result of trouble at university/family tensions. 

My advice would be contacting a charity like Shelter or Crisis now, ahead of time, so that you have all the advice you need. Also potentially could you check in with your GP, and see if there is any more support you could be getting from them right now? Mine was able to connect me to a charity that really helped provide a stable hour for me each week to talk about my problems.

Also a good place to find a room in a houseshare is Spare Rooms, you can usually find a cheaper rental there and move in very quickly as there are less checks, seeing as you are only taking on a room. I was homeless (well in a hotel, which obviously was easier) for a little bit but it was only a couple of weeks thanks to Spare Rooms and getting a house share.

Having left my course I was very directionless, and I also completely understand struggles around getting student finance funding after using up your first loan. However, I have just got onto a free course for coding with a university, which may not be your thing, but it's an example of some of the help out there. Also I think the political situation here may be changing, and after the next General Election there may be a lot more help in course funding again.

I think just as a general point as everyone else has mentioned here, be super kind to yourself right now. Treat yourself with a lot of compassion. You will find your way through, that's the one thing I wish I could have told myself back then."	Tall_Ad109	reply	na	na	na	0.9959232807159424	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Ah, got it; unfortunately I don't have a clear sense of what social welfare services available in the UK, but is there gov't subsidized housing or a housing list for the unhoused? I didn't recommend it for the US because the waiting list is ~7+ years and it doesn't help you in the short term. 

Being mentally ill in the UK is rough, especially in education; one of my friends ended up getting educated in the US because he bombed his A levels, even though he was top of his class--his anxiety got to him, and that meant 2 years of work down the drain. I almost went to the UK for my PhD, but I was advised that I'll likely flunk out because of my mental illness and how intolerant the UK education system is about it. I'm really sorry about the harshness you're facing. Just know that it's really the school's failures, not yours: if US schools can accommodate for mental illness so that I could graduate, there's no reason UK schools can't either; they're just being ableist."

"Tbh I think my university have been incredibly supportive, but things got very dangerous and due to the course I'm doing, they have to be more cautious. My experience is the complete oppposite to what you are saying about being a UK student with MH issues. If I am kicked off my course, it won't be because of my mental health issues per se, but because my university feel it's not safe for me to continue studying. I hoping and praying they don't opt for withdrawal, that is the most severe option, but it is a very real possibility too.

We do have social housing in the UK too, but similar to the US the demand far outstrips supply and waits can be incredibly long. At present, I would not be much of a priority over and above families, etc. 

My uni have been incredibly accommodating of my needs, I have support plans and very regular support, they do a lot better than many UK unis.

"hey! i completely relate. here are some suggestions:

• STOPP (distress tolerance) - if you feel you may engage in unwanted behaviours. pause for a moment. take a breathe. proceed mindfully.

• TIPP (distress tolerance) - try dunking your face in ice cold water, having a cold shower, holding an ice cube. try doing some intense exercise. try some paced breathing - breathe deep and slow to relax your nervous system.

• Self-soothe (distress tolerance) - try to nurture yourself and engage in your senses. try touching something soft like a blanket, notice how it feels and wrap yourself in it. try listening to calming and soothing music, really listen to the flow of the sounds.

• Radical acceptance (distress tolerance) - radically accept the situation and that you have no control over the dogs. accept and acknowledge that it is unpleasant. let go.

• Half-smiling and willing hands (distress tolerance) - gently soften your face and slightly smile with upturned hands to send opposite signals to your body.

• Non-judgementalness (mindfulness) - notice your judgements about how your feeling and how you feel you “should” be feeling. be kind to yourself and recognise that it is understandable you’re feeling this way.

"Title, but to elaborate: 16M, struggle with anger issues, particularly with my mom. Planning on discussing with my therapist. With my mom, she does anything, I can feel a strong irritability or anxiety at times. Situation doesn't matter normally. If she's talking to me, that irritability becomes intense enough to get me doing impulsive shit like walking away, using defensive body language, snarking, just general asshole behavior. Not good, especially when I don't know why I'm doing it, and don't have a polite way of dealing with it yet. Feel ashamed of it.

Diagnosed with major depression, anxiety, and autism level 2 if that matters to this.

Thanks y'all

Edit: Damn, all the advice is gonna be useful.

"Man, being 16 sucks. I’m over 70 now and still have anger issues, but nowhere near what I was like at 16. I fought with my mom so much! The only therapists in the 1950s were mostly Freudian. There was no adhd, no psych meds other than barbiturates or anti psychotics. You, my friend, have more psychological awareness than the entire population of America back then. 

What you have have missed is that ‘snarky behavior is your brain trying to protect you. Walking away is ‘good’ if you are angry. You just need to learn some skills to do it gracefully. 

Plus you are 16 and your brain has ten more years to lock in neuronal changes before it is fully mature. You’re on the right track! Asking for help can be helpful, so there’s that. 

I recommend going to YouTube and searching for DBT skills. Then watch a few. You can’t go wrong as every skill can be useful in different situations. Maybe throw the word ‘irritable’ into the search.

Also look for ‘the six steps of ‘validation’. Validation is so important in relationships of any stripe and we get way way too little of it. Spend ten minutes learning the six steps of validation and watch your relationships improve. 

OK - anger - I just happened to be reading about this tonight. Here’s a quote about married couples but it would work with some changes for you. 

“3. Anger

Anger Anger makes you want to attack (on the phone, e-mail, in person, text, etc). What’s most important to reduce anger is to DISENGAGE. Walk away, hang up, don’t text, don’t e-mail—but do so gently, without the last word, without ire. Just get distance. If you stay connected, anger will stay up or even increase. After disengaging, practice kindness. See the world through your loved one’s eyes, find compassion (see page 96) for him or her, do something kind for him or her. Anger cannot be maintained in the face of compassion. With anger, rumination is often a problem. Cues of anger keep recurring, so compassion has to be used over and over again to keep anger down.” From the book “Loving Someone With  Borderline Personality w” by Shari Y Manning

"I would recommend working on calming down your sympathetic nervous system. You are currently close to a threshold and every little thing probably sets you off. By calming down your sympathetic nervous system it lowers your starting point so it takes longer to hit a threshold which gives you more time to process and think about how you want to respond instead of going straight to a reaction (anger).  I just started this process with my therapist so I don’t know what it looks like just yet but I bet there is a lot of research out there. 

I’m 33 and I still struggle with going straight to anger. I find when my depression is bad I get really irritable and if everyone could just leave me the fuck alone I would be great. 😂 so you aren’t alone in this. Good luck OP!

"Good on you, seriously, for asking for help with this!! That is going to be so good for you as you grow, I wish I'd learned this at your age.

One thing I've done recently is try to use my 5 senses in the moment, to try to zoom out and take me out of seeing red. Like: what does the air smell like? Can I touch something? Drink some water and taste it, feel the glass. As I'm doing this, trying to slow my breathing, feeling the air through my nose.


Once I get some distance, doing about a minute of box breathing does wonders for me -- breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4, breathe out for 4, hold the empty breath for 4, then repeat. The great thing about this is, while I prefer to do it alone, I can box breathe while listening to someone in a conversation, or chopping vegetables, etc, so it doesn't have to mean excusing yourself.

And one more thing, is accepting that this is happening. Not to downplay this at all, but it's very normal for teenagers to be hella irritable, and especially with their parents -- I know I was. I think it's part of maturing and getting to leave the nest, we just get extra on top of it 😂 Accepting that it's normal, and building fun things for you to look forward to in your day, might help you get out of the irritability... ""Oh look, it's my mom, and it's my annoyance again right on time, but I can go play my game after dinner and it won't be a big deal""

Ok 2 more things:
There is a DBT skill called TIPP which stands for: Temperature –Intense Exercise –Paced breathing – Paired muscle relaxation. People in my DBT group really liked grabbing ice cubes (temperature) to bring anger down - didn't work for me, but might for you!

Lastly, I wrote down these skills on note ards and stuck them in my wallet. When I'm waiting or even bored at work, I take them out and study them. Because there are a lot of skills, even tools I've kinda figured out on my own, but if I don't work to remind myself of them, I don't remember them in the moment. So pick a few things and really try to memorize them. Or in your mom's example, if say it's always in the kitchen that you get irritated, pick something like the sink to associate with what you're going to do .. so that when you see the sink, your brain remembers ""Oh yeah, I can go turn on hot or cold water, run my hands, take a sip, smell it, and use that to help me zoom out"".

Hope some of this was helpful, and good luck!!! Your therapist may have some great tools for ya too!!

P.S. one more thing - practice!! There's a good chance you won't remember the skills in the moment for the first while, and then they may not work great the first few tries. DON'T GIVE UP! (I'm talking to myself here too lol) Learning a skill isn't a silver bullet or a quick fix. If they don't work at first, it's not because they're stupid or because you're doing it wrong. It just takes practice, and time. Give them a good try before deciding to add them to your long-term skillset or look for other skills. 😊"	ChestValuable9143	reply	na	na	na	0.9874260425567627	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

I've always had the personality and mindset of being very independent. I'm an only child, and I had loving parents who taught me to be hard working and self reliant. I've had 3 jobs since I was 17 (26 now). I always did my best to do what needed to be done asap. I went above and beyond at work since most workers would slack and socialize instead of doing their job. So they thought I was a kiss up cause most managers liked me, since I was a good worker. I've never made friends at work. I've been married for almost 6 years. We met at my second job. He was first attracted to me because I'm a hard worker. He had a major surgery while we were dating, and I felt the need to take care of him as he was recovering. His family wasn't there as much as they should've been, but I was willing to drive 30 minutes almost every day to see him. We had a baby 2 years after marriage, and even though I was exhausted, I still tried to do everything, and felt guilty when others would offer to help. My mom came over daily for the first couple weeks, and when she asked how she could help I said she could wash dishes, and the look on her face said she'd rather not do that. I stopped asking for help after that. There wasn't much my husband could do with baby since I was br**stfeeding. I returned to work and cared for baby when I got home and in the middle of the night. Even though I could've asked my husband to do more, I didn't cause I didn't want to seem like a nag or a burden. I once asked my mom to watch baby for an extra day to pick up a work shift, and she reluctantly agreed, even though prior she was so excited to get to watch baby every day. Around this time, my husband had a mental breakdown at work. After talking to me, we agreed that for his mental health he needed to quit, so he did. He's been jobless for 3 years now. He went to school and got a certificate in something he's passionate about. He's applied a few times to jobs and nothing worked out. He's done freelance work a few times but always got screwed. He watches our now 4yo while I work. I got a new job last year. I work for an amazing company and loved what I was originally hired to do, but after 4 months they noticed my work ethic and promoted me to a new position. It took me a while to figure it out, but now I have more confidence in what I'm doing. The only problem is I usually work alone, and I'm responsible for everything getting done. There's only 2 other people trained for this position, and they're not as experienced as me. If they aren't available when I need help, I'm sol. I usually work through my breaks and sometimes lunches just to get ahead. I should ask for more help, but the other departments are busy too and I don't want them to fall behind. I'm getting a bit better with asking for help around the house, since I want to teach my child the importance of helping and taking responsibility. I only ask her to clean messes she's made though, but as she gets older that may change. If she offers to help I let her do simple tasks. My husband doesn't normally offer to help cause he knows I do things a certain way, but doesn't mind helping if I do ask, and wants me to ask more often before I get overwhelmed.

"Personally, I found that for big questions like yours, psychodynamic therapy was better at helping me than DBT. But in DBT, skills like mindfulness of thought and emotion and STUN may help you. I would even try chain analysis--not focusing on the harm you caused (or alternatively, focusing on the harm you're causing yourself), but rather focusing on ABC-EF to figure out what emotions, memories, deep rooted beliefs about yourself, etc. cause you take on so much. 

As for current skills that I think will help right now, here are a few: 

1. Radical acceptance of others' help. It doesn't matter if they seem reluctant to you, etc--they offered it, and if they don't want to do it, it's up to them to tell you that explicitly. 
2. With that, if you're anything like me, I suspect you're sensitive to rejection. Moments in your text like, ""I didn't want to seem like a nag or a burden,"" ""I don't want other departments to fall behind,"" etc. indicate to me that you've sort of rejected people's help *before they even had a chance to reject your request*. I would do a check the facts: what is the fear? What is the catastrophe (i.e. what's the worst that can happen)? And then problem solve or use opposite action as necessary. 
3. Finally, the final skill I would offer is dialectics. ""I do things a certain way"" really caught my eye as someone with diagnosed OCD. For me, OCD isn't just a bunch of rituals, but a rigidity of thinking--the dishes *have* to be a done a certain way, the order of tasks at work *have* to be how I do it, etc. etc. But other people have different ways of doing things, and ultimately, they get done. Do I get nervous every time my partner cleans the kitchen because I *know* he's not doing it as well as I do? Yes, but his getting it done is way better than the meltdown I'll have in three days from feeling like I do everything around the house. It's not: clean or not clean--it's clean *enough*. From personal experience, I think letting go of the rigidity of doing things your way may also help you accept others' help more. 

Hope some of this helps! Apologies if anything was off the mark--I can only draw from my personal experience, so please ignore anything that doesn't apply to you. Sending loving kindness :)"	Pitchygirl	reply	na	na	na	0.9887472987174988	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

- Self Validation 
- Dear Man, Give & Fast (particularly Dear Man to help with asking for what you need without feeling guilty)
- Mindfulness - of your thoughts, emotions particularly focusing on how much of your energy you are expending on others as opposed to yourself 

And finally, I would use Check the Facts when you feel Guolt  for asking for/accepting help. If you really truly check the facts you will see that no human is able to do anything entirely alone.

It’s been a while since I broke down this hard but last year I went through a painful loss of a friend group due to their perception of my emotional dysregulation and I was not healthy with my own choice in behavior. So it was viewed as drama and I was cut ties. One of the people still insisting to be friends only triggered the pain and while I value possible friendship I am technically disliked and viewed as mentally unstable or toxic to some folks from the group. I am just wanting to know if radical acceptance is appropriate to say “ok it’s over with these folks “ and would it be wise that a potential friendship end also because they remind me of that group? Just seeking suggestions on skills breakdown because I feel the pain and shame about who I am as a person is so strong over the rejection I just wanna shut down.

"Radical acceptance is a choice. 

It sounds like you’re somewhat undecided over what to do, so I’d maybe use the pros + cons skill first. What are the pros + cons of getting back in touch/staying in touch with these friends, and what are the pros + cons of not doing that? Try writing them down, rather than just thinking about it. It’ll make your thinking more thorough. Once you have decided, you can use radical acceptance to let this friendship group go if needed. 

It also sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of shame. Know that like any emotion, it’ll pass. Try to label the shame-filled thoughts and acknowledge how that feeling is impacting your self identity right now.

"I'm so sorry you're having to make such a painful choice and I hope you know that you are important and that your feelings are 💯 valid and understandable. I find that, for radical acceptance, meditation helps me a lot to ease me into the process and connect me to Wise Mind, which is where I need to be to fully process Radical acceptance. There are many wonderful mindfulness exercises on YouTube as well as on many apps that address radical acceptance and wise mind as well.

I love the suggestion someone had about the pro/con list. Not to figure out what to do (which it sounds like you've already decided), but to reinforce your decision and help turn the mind. Writing down what I am feeling and what my thoughts are in the present also helps me check the facts and it gets everything out of my system so I can be more clear and effective, and again, I can more easily turn to RA.

Speaking of which, turning the mind is a good skill to do as well when you're having a hard time coming into Radical acceptance. I have found it helpful, but to be completely honest, Ive only used it once or twice.

"I’m struggling to understand radical acceptance, because I don’t think I know what acceptance really means. Everything I’ve found that tries to define it, I struggle to grasp. It either uses the word to define the word (like “acceptance means accepting that…”) or says what it’s not (“it means not fighting reality”.)

The example thoughts they use to describe fighting reality are things I don’t tend to think. (“It’s not fair.” “It shouldn’t be this way.”) So I don’t know how to stop thinking those thoughts, since I’m not. I know I’m dysregulated and I know I could use some serious radical acceptance, I just don’t know what that is.

Can you tell me what it means to you?"	NaomiBanana	post	17.075894260397984	female	White	0.9985610842704773	na	na	na	53	dbtselfhelp
"To me it means recognising that things are what they are, even if that’s something awful. To radically accept it just means that you choose to live with this state. Just accept it. This is how it is. I cannot change this. Understanding you cannot change the world, the past, people’s behaviour etc, and just choosing to be ok with that. It doesn’t mean you aren’t upset, but you also accept how it makes you feel. 

This has happened. It sucks. It’s awful. It makes me feel terrible. But I cannot change that. I cannot change how I feel because that is not good for me. I must learn to accept my emotions as well as the reality of life. It sounds terrifying and radical because it is."	NaomiBanana	reply	na	na	na	0.9985610842704773	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"So radical acceptance is kind of like relaxing all the muscles in your body and your brain -- and just sitting and saying to yourself ""I may not like it, but this is how things are. I will cope with my discomfort over this. I will not put my energy into imagining things being different, trying to change circumstances beyond my control and trust that this will work out for me."" 

And it's recognizing what's a story and what's factual. The stories take you away from accepting reality.

When my ex blocked me with no explanation while we were friends, I made a story that it was my fault. There's no facts to back that up. My DBT group said ""don't mull it over or wonder, just cope with the discomfort of not knowing."" So, it's just looking at factually what the situation is and how it makes you feel, and how our stories cause unnecessary suffering. 

For my example, I felt afraid something happened, sad the connection was over for now -- and just rode the wave of those emotions. Before that, I was suffering because I kept thinking of what I did, how it might mean I'm a bad person, that I fucked up, that he hates me. From that perspective/story, I felt I had to fix or change the situation. I wasn't acting based on reality, but my insecurities. 

I was gentle with myself for those human insecurities, forgave myself, and turned my mind away from that narrative over time and towards acceptance. 

There's a million and ten reasons why people do what they do, and we can't mind read and say we know why other people do things. Even if we know them really well. Are they crossing their arms because they're angry or bored? Well, they could be cold because they're under an air vent. 

It's simplifying the situation at hand. It's relaxing and doing half smile, willing hands and saying to ourselves ""this is the way things must be."" -- turning the mind. Cope with the true primary emotions. 

It's the hardest skill to master. Be gentle with yourself. Be patient with yourself."	NaomiBanana	reply	na	na	na	0.9985610842704773	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

I’m working on this in my yoga practice as well. Some poses are really uncomfortable for me, and difficult to hold for any length of time. But if I’m not risking injury by staying in a pose (such as by overstretching) I’m learning to just accept that it doesn’t feel good and stay still when my body REALLY wants to move out of the pose. I sort of use this for an analogy when I’m trying to accept something uncomfortable in my life; to just accept that it doesn’t feel good but to be “still” mentally instead of fighting it.

"I like thinking of radical acceptance as also just radical acknowledment. Sometimes ‘acceptance’ has ppl thinking you’re approving, but that’s not the case! 
The best way to explain this concept to me and for why it works is this example which comes from a Buddhism idea about ‘Two Arrows’.  The below story explains the first arrow shot is the inevitable suffering (which we can’t change)  and then the (metaphorical) second arrow shot is all the optional suffering you cause from your reaction to the first arrow that shot you.  
We cannot change inevitable pain, but if we choose to acknowledge (rather than fighting reality ‘why has this happened to me!?’). 
Reality acceptance can reduce our distress levels as fighting reality or arguing a cause for it cannot really change the present. 
This is the story below (adapted) 

You are walking in the woods and suddenly you get struck by an arrow (someone fires an arrow at you) and it hits your arm and it really really hurts–its very painful and you feel that physical pain in your arm, and it’s bleeding. And then immediately your mind starts to think, “Oh my god! what’s gonna happen? What if I bleed to death? What if this is infected and I can’t walk back home properly? Or I lose energy and I can’t get back to my family? What’s gonna happen to my family? What’s gonna be happening to my husband/wife/my children? What’s gonna happen to me or what’s going to happen to their future, how will they be doing?”

The Buddha described the first arrow as the physical pain and the second arrow is what your mind does–it starts thinking about the worst scenario that can happen (catastrophizing, minimizing, blaming). And the Buddha says, “be warned of the second arrow.”

The first arrow represents the pain–the actual physical pain–and the second arrow represents what you call suffering. So we distinguish between pain and suffering. Pain is something that’s inevitable, we all experience that. But the suffering is something that we actually create. But we don’t realise that.

"My teacher always uses the example of a cheating partner. It's something that most people would not consciously accept or tolerate.

However some people choose to unconditionally Love and accept their partner.

So when I think of radical acceptance, the radical part is being far outside of societal Norm.

So in the example of a cheating partner radical acceptance would be staying in the relationship and working through that conflict. It's a radical approach because it is the more challenging path to take.

A lot of people would rather give up play the victim and demonize their partner.

But if you radically accept your partner for all of their strengths and weaknesses, and they want to reconcile. The other partner must unconditionally Love and accept their personhood and be able to separate it from the behavior.

The separation between the person and the behavior really helps me a lot in my acceptance towards difficult relationships.

For example I unconditionally love and accept my mother but there are certain behaviors that I will not tolerate.

So for me spending time with my mother at family events is a form of radical acceptance because I do it for kind of the greater good of the family unit as a whole and I'm able to separate that action from my emotions."	NaomiBanana	reply	na	na	na	0.9985610842704773	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

I guess taking both my positive and negative thinking and neutralizing my thoughts so that I see both sides and accept it's components simultaneously.  It's not fighting against what is but accepting it as it is as moving forward.

Sure, so most people doing DBT have BPD, and a key part of that (and other similar severe mental health disorders) cannot cope with their own emotions. As such, they seek to escape them via self harm or other behaviours such as drinking and drugs. The goal of radical acceptance is to get you to sit with your emotions and accept them. Don’t fear them. It’s very hard but practice makes it easier. You use the TIPP skills to calm yourself down if needed and mindfulness. Over time you realise that the emotions will eventually get easier to deal with and your arousal goes back down from panicked to upset but manageable.

Part of it is being able to forgive yourself. So don’t look to justify it. It’s not “because you’re a loser who can’t even get in the shower”. You just accept “I am struggling right now and am finding it hard to shower.” It’s not because you’re a terrible person. It’s just because you’re struggling. If you make a mistake with a client, you accept “I made a mistake because I am human” and rather than catastrophising and then panicking and potentially looking for an outlet for those feelings, you just accept that this happened and sit with those feelings. Then you can look to interpersonal effectiveness to solve the problem with the client, and use your distress tolerance skills to help calm yourself down. Remember, it’s okay to make mistakes.

"This was very helpful and relatable, it sounds like you’re more than halfway “there” (to my own subjective understanding of the skill in my own practice)
- you’re noticing the catastrophic thoughts
- you’re able to realize that your thoughts are not you

I struggled a lot with over-engaging “rational mind” because I had been raised with the mentality that emotions were nonsense symptoms of a broken mind, and so casting judgments on emotions that “made no sense” was holding me back. There was an exercise in the Emotion Regulation module about “what is this emotion for” that really forced my rational mind to make a place for the pesky emotion. Also doing a Values Card Sort helped me understand my values, which was HUGE. I’m going to try to model those skills in how I understand your situation, understanding I might not have it quite right, but I hope it helps. 

“God I couldn’t get ice cream for the kids, I am a terrible mother and ruining their childhood”

“It feels terrible to let my kids down”

“I am feeling this terrible way because it’s important to me that I do the best that I can for my kids”

“It is possible to make mistakes and still have the same values, and it makes sense that it feels bad when that happens”

“This emotion is unpleasant and the thoughts are irrational, but I am grateful to know that my body is trying to help me to follow the path that aligns with my values and goals”

From a place of accepting that the negative emotions and catastrophic thoughts are coming from your emotion mind’s HELPFUL functioning to let you know what’s important to you, it can be easier to approach the catastrophic thoughts again. Sometimes I imagine the emotion processing as like some adorable animal, like a kitten trying to pounce into a sunbeam and getting frustrated it’s not coordinated enough- a light attitude of gentle good humor with the sweet pity you would show a kitten you know will figure it out eventually. Making friends with all your parts can be hard, especially the ones you are ashamed of, but believing it all is coming from… you could call it love, you could call it the unbroken chain of evolutionary processes that helped your ancestors survive, you could call it your own soul’s highest purpose- but just knowing there’s a reason that comes from a good place even if it manifests horribly sometimes can get you a looooong way"	NaomiBanana	reply	na	na	na	0.9985610842704773	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

I used to be in a teen group and my group leader used examples like fighting with her siblings, her experiences being on a basketball team and having a really mean coach, which lead to her negative self talk as an adult, and taking care of her puppy. Having examples that evoked things we were going through made it easy to connect the dots."	Minute_Elderberry335	reply	na	na	na	0.0011746353702619672	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Sorry for my English in advance.

My Main Problem: when someone constantly tries to push my boundaries, guilt Trips me, or tries to fuck with my head and my perceptions, is denying the truth, making threats .... -> i loose my cool and get verbally mean and abusive. 
It feels the only way to protect myself, because nothing else helps. 

The bad thing is then, that even if i was may have only reacting to that, it is still my abuse and i am now the Bad and crazy one, for exploding and getting mean. 

The other Partien can stay calm, and push, push, and in the end i am the crazy one 'on paper' -> happened that it was used against me.

I want to change that. I mean usually it happens with other individuals with mental health problems. 

I have seen/witnessed that kind of communication as the norm at home, and never thought it would be that hard to put this habit away. My mom stayed in unhealthy relationships and fought on a daily Basis instead to leave a situation if she is not happy and nothing changes. 

I am afraid i do this now too, stay way too long with individuals who 'need to change' and instead of leaving i get verbally abusive to make them feel the same and protect myself ? 
But then, both Parties are abusing each other and it gets entangled and its hard to see who is right and who is wrong. That is why i stay, because sometimes they try to make me clear, that no one else will put up with me and my bullshit. So i think it is a bit true even, because i know, no healthy person would tolerate verbal abuse. 

Anything that helped ? Success stories?"	Gelato_nberries	post	22.708537757329875	female	White	0.9980138540267944	na	na	na	10	dbtselfhelp
"My old therapist would always say, “Do you want to be right or do you want to solve the problem?” Because I was working at a job where people were manipulative like that, and I’d want to go off about how it was unfair to me and my team how they were behaving especially considering we knew better what needed to happen, etc., etc. And he’d tell me that I was *right*: the way they were talking to us was condescending, manipulative, and unfair. But if I tried to prove I was right by (aggressively) explaining the situation, things would get worse for my team because it would be seen as me being rude and inappropriate in the work place regardless of the fact that I was just defending myself and my friends from really messed up behavior. 

So I learned to just validate myself (“I know that I’m right here and they are being judgmental and cruel”) but still just walk away as that would have a better outcome for me and the people I cared about it the long run. It’s super fucking hard and I still don’t get it right 100% of the time, but it’s something I try to keep top of mind. 

I’m in another crappy job now (I did have a good one in between these 😭) and my boss thinks I’m leaving because a chronic health problem means it’s hard for me to do the job. That’s not why I’m leaving — I’m leaving because she is condescending, rude, manipulative, and incapable of emotionally regulating and I don’t want to work with her. But I’m not going to tell her that because it would blow up in my face. Instead, I’m working really hard to get out ASAP because I know it wouldn’t be possible to have a productive and honest conversation with her where she respects me."

"It helps to see the person's dysregulation and ineffective behaviors as their burden, not yours. This helps you not take their behavior personally, and see it as their lack of emotional skills. 

Mindfulness around reactivity, not making things worse and that boundaries (like ""if you continue to speak to me with your voice raised/uncooperatively, I'm going to step away."") And be sure to focus on regulating yourself instead of addressing or changing other people's behavior -- because even with boundaries, all we can control is ourselves and decide what we will tolerate/be around, and what we remove ourselves from.

So I don’t have as much practice there, but something I have done semi-successfully is consciously deciding to walk away temporarily any time I feel … threatened isn’t quite the right word. But if I get that, “Oh, this person is trying to manipulate me and I can’t give in I need to defend myself and not let them change my thinking how do I make them stop” and it’s super escalated I’ll end the conversation for that day.

"Yes, it can be a difficult concept to grasp. It comes down to viewing reality from a place of being objective and nonjudgmental. It doesn’t mean you agree with what is happening. It also doesn’t mean you think “they should/shouldn’t have” or “I should/shouldn’t have”. It is recognizing that all things have a cause, and when you notice yourself going down the path of non-acceptance (wishing it were different, striving to somehow problem solve to make it different, fantasizing about it being different or what could be if things had gone differently, etc) you make a conscious decision to turn towards accepting reality exactly as it is. 

Non-acceptance of reality causes suffering, which you can diminish or avoid by accepting. This doesn’t mean you will be happy about what is happening or agreeing with what is happening. If something difficult happens you will still feel pain. What it does is allows you to embrace that pain as a part of the experience of living as a human, while stepping off of the path that causes the suffering (which is always self-inflicted).

Instead of needing to accept? Cut action out entirely. Objectivity is existence as an object. It does not ask permission, and it requires no emotional input.

"I love that you are asking this question!! :)

As others have said, radical acceptance is more like acknowledging the reality of a situation. 

You can radically accept the present. You can radically accept the past. You cannot radically accept the future, because that hasn’t happened yet and isn’t fact. You can radically accept the *possibility* that something could happen — that it is a possibility. 

So, definitely don’t try to accept something like “it’ll always be this way.” First of all, that’s way too general, and second of all, that’s the future. (Of course, there are some things we can say about the future with near 100% confidence — (tw: death, illness) like xyz is dead and will remain dead, and the sun will come up tomorrow, and if you’ve been diagnosed with a lifelong condition, that is unlikely to go away — but those are much more specific and also based in facts we know about the universe, like how dead people stay dead) 

You cannot radically accept opinions or judgements — you can accept *that* someone has that opinion or judgement, but you cannot accept they opinion as reality. Only accept facts. For example, I can accept *that* xyz thinks I’m stupid (a judgement) but not that I *am* stupid."	womenarenice	reply	na	na	na	0.002065572189167142	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

Yeah, for me being unwilling/not radically accepting feels like I'm fighting the entire universe to try to make something else true. Vs when I'm in radical acceptance and being willing, I have surrendered to the universe and been honest with myself about what I really can control and what I can't. And that all there is is the present moment, and the past can't be shifted, but I can do things now to influence (not control) the future. That's the best as I can describe it, anyway.

Accepting a situation wholly: body, mind, and spirit. This means paying attention to your nonverbals and body language, turning your mind back to acceptance every time you find yourself not accepting again, and allowing whatever consequences as a result of accepting to happen.

"I thibk Self Validation, Radical Acceptance and Opposite Action  might be useful here. 
You've done a great job on Checking the Facts! That's awesome, and it's really good how you've managed to see your friends actions from a Dialectical position. However, even if your friend didn't intend to upset you, and you're able to see things from their perspective, you are still hurt and your emotions are still valid. 

Try telling yourself something like ""I know my friend didn't intend this but I am human and I feel hurt and that's ok. This feeling will pass and I will be ok"" 

Next try Radical Acceptance. If this is something that happens regularly maybe you're a sensitive person and that's ok too. In fact being sensitive is a lovely thing to be in many ways. So try accepting this part of you and not fighting it. You're obviously good at self reflecting and seeing reality so the next step might be to accept reality. 

And finally use Opposite Urge. Identify the emotions you feel and see what the urge is and then try doing the exact opposite. So if you're angry with your friend try approaching them with kindness and curiosity gor their actions. 
If you're feeling very distressed and sad try doing something fun and nice for yourself. By doing the opposite of your emotions you can show your brain ajf nervous system that the emotions you feel are not based in fact and slowly begin to change your emotions .

"I just had a therapy session where I discovered something so important! I was trying to understand when I will be BPD free enough to be in a healthy relationship. The answer was when I am relatively comfortable with these two things.
And I wanted to hear your guyses thoughts:
1.When I am able to accept the things that piss me off without blaming the other person.
No matter what the situation is (unhealthiness excluded!), I should be able to handle it with grace and take accountability for being irritable.
Even if I think the other person is wrong or difficult, I should be able to handle it lovingly.
This is another way of saying ""Distress
Tolerance.""

2. When I am not so intense.
When we can just spend time together and have fun and laugh without the other being worried about something that may cause me to go all emotional. Or me being able to just laugh and relax instead of being uptight and intense.

This is another way of saying Emotion Regulation.


+ being mindful of how I feel around this person and whether I'd like to be in a relationship with them. This is mindfulness.
Wonder what y'all think? Having these concrete goals has been really helpful for me and I'd love to hear if you think I'm missing something important or if you have any other important things."	LeahsManyQs	post	29.07680407081648	male	White	0.0014731127303093672	na	na	na	5	dbtselfhelp
"While I appreciate where you're coming from and I applaud your willingness to work on yourself, I want to caution you from thinking too black and white. It worries me that you say things like, ""**No matter what the situation is**, I should be able to..."" and ""just laugh and relax instead of being uptight and intense."" These don't leave a lot of room for dialectics--you're *allowed to be upset and intense sometimes,* just like any other human being. I'm intense about cleanliness, and honestly I don't think it's a problem to have a select few things you're intense about--most people are. 

Additionally, I think this isn't exactly how love works--sometimes you just fall in love with someone at the most inconvenient times. And if someone is willing to be in a relationship with you, I think it's also a type of radical acceptance and self love to be able to recognize that they *see your flaws and still want you.* I used to have a worst imposter syndrome about it, but if someone is willing to help you work on your issues, I would personally work on it together than go down the road alone.

"Love it. I think it's really helpful to have concrete things to work on. 

I think this ties in well with the goals and values section of emotion regulation. A value could be ""relationships"" and a goal could be ""heaving a healthy long term relationship"". Then you can think practically about breaking down the steps in between that you need to take to work in line with that value and towards that goal.

&#x200B;

Another point on values: I think that working towards having a solid understanding of your own wise mind values  and priorities in life is another useful indicator of being ready for a healthy long term relationship. This is slow and takes time, but I think it's really important. Particularly for people with BPD, sometimes we lose touch with our values because we change them depending on who we're around (to avoid abandonment for example). This can lead to all sorts of havoc in relationships. I think also knowing your values can help with choosing to pursue relationships with people who share those values and are compatible with what you want out of life in general, instead of just impulsively going along with whoever's around."

"Oh my, was this a thoughtful and kind response! Thank you so so much for validating my statement but also, for seeing beneath the message and noticing me   😊

I absolutely hear your point about black and whites. I kind of just want a rule! But I do also deserve to be allowed my intensity at times and respected through it, in just the same way I would others! And the black and white thinking itself causes anxiety because it’s unattainable and blind to be broken. 

Regarding your second point which is even more beautiful than the first, this still leaves me with a question - because how will I know that I’m ready to be skillful enough to maintain a long term relationship without relapsing into codependency or fear of abandonment or emotional volatility? I would love it if someone was willing to accept me as I am right now, but I understand that can be difficult to ask of someone. Is there a sweet spot or should I work on believing that I’m constantly loveable and worth being in a dofficult relationship with?"

"Hey, sorry for the late response! It was partially that these comments take up a lot of brain energy and partially that I wanted to make sure I give you a thoughtful response--hope you don't mind! 

For me, the answer to your question is the dialectic mantra, ""we are all trying our best, *and* we can all strive to do better."" Maybe this is bad of me, but for me, the *only* condition that makes someone undateable is if they reject any and all critique about themselves, and thus refuse to make compromises--because they're always convinced they're in the right. If people are willing to change for the better, and generally compromise, you can be in a relationship with them, no matter how rough of a shape they're in right now. Don't get me wrong--I think dating people with severe mental illness + especially severe trauma is really, really rough. Both relationships I've been in with heavily traumatized people left me with significant trauma on top of my own childhood trauma. But at the same time, I'd never say they were unlovable or unworthy. I knew what I signed up for when I started dating them, and then it got to be too much and untenable, one of us left. That's okay. We had something beautiful when it lasted, and I can only be grateful for the experience. I think that's also a form of dialectics: things can be good, but it doesn't have to be eternal to be good. 

I guess as a final warning, though, I wouldn't stay in a relationship where you're the only person who can see your faults and are willing to change. I was in a relationship once where I listened and changed myself in so many ways to try and be a better person for my partner. He had his own faults, but whenever I tried to point them out, he had a meltdown. It took him 6 months to realize that calling me fat everyday was actually mean, not just ""calling out the facts"" like he claimed. He once called it a ""sacrifice"" to stop calling me names, which should have been my cue to leave, but I had become so desensitized to how he put me down. It's not fair if you're willing to listen to critique and work on yourself, and the other person isn't. You seem very level headed so this is probably advice you don't need, but I just want to make sure you still have self respect while you work on yourself! I was *terrible* at dialectics, and I thought having (really big, gaping) flaws meant I was a bad person who deserved to be treated as lesser. It's not true. You still deserve the best kind of love and care, even when you have flaws. 

Sorry for such a long answer; hope some of it was what you were looking for! Sending loving kindness :)"	LeahsManyQs	reply	na	na	na	0.0014731127303093672	strong	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"This is something that I am going to need help troubleshooting so I’m gonna comeback and report what works and doesn’t. 
Medically, I experience Narcolepsy which has [hypnagogic hallucinations](https://Experienceoftransitioningfromwakefulnesstosleephttps://g.co/kgs/gXa3zd). For people who don’t experience it, you can interpret it as lucid dreaming-but-nightmares that mess with your senses. Sleep is a big vulnerability for me and experiencing these hallucinations makes this harder, compounded by the fear making them more intense until I’m not able to determine what is real or a hallucination until it’s over and I’m too awake to fall back asleep. I’m able to pick them out as hallucinations because they don’t make rational sense and happen when I am tired. 

What I want help with is what skills can I use to calm down emotionally in the moment that only requires cognitive thinking, as I can’t rely on my senses and worse case scenario, I can’t move. If anyone has experience with any medical or recreational-hallucinogens-gone-bad, what skills based off emotional distress being a trigger could I try?"	tucktuck101	post	24.72144754559965	female	White	0.01658727414906025	na	na	na	1	dbtselfhelp

"Hi! I'm considering starting a DBT program at the recommendation of my current therapist. Based on our experience together, she thinks I'd be a good candidate for it, but it's not something she's trained in, so we're looking into options for me to try it. In particular, the more structured, classroom-like setting seems like a good fit because I'm not particularly good at self-directing or accountability for practicing on my own.

I need to address some really big anxiety and depression that developed during a whole conveyor belt of shitty life events (all during a global pandemic on top of it). I feel like I can see the ruts I'm stuck in, but every time I think I'm working my way out, I get knocked back in. I'm stable and have been doing well for a little while now, but I'm still on a reduced work schedule for the 2nd time in a year because I just have these phases where I'm reacting to regular-sized problems as if they're gigantic Godzilla problems. I meditate daily and it really does help, but I know there's more out there I could be learning.

I'm speaking with someone about an intensive 3-month program to learn more about that option, but I'm curious to hear folks' experiences with the 24-month skills class (plus weekly therapy) approach. I like that the intensive program would have continuity between the classes and the individual therapy portions, but it does seem like a LOT for my particular situation. I'd also have to go part-time at work for three months, and I'm very lucky to have a supportive work environment for something like that, but I'm also just not sure it's the right fit.

I guess I'm mostly wondering, if you did the long version of the program, did you find yourself wishing for more support or structure, or did you feel like that was enough?

"So it's a little unclear what you mean by intensive--is it IOP or inpatient?--but I think this is mostly a matter of how much your quality of life is impeded. In general, more intensive programs are recommended for people who increasingly can't manage on their own for whatever reason--hence psych wards for suicide attempts, inpatient/residential for recently suicidal and/or low function patients, etc etc. If you feel your QOL is so impeded you need an intensive program (an evaluation your therapist can make as well), the intensive is the way to go. 

If you can manage not to go to an intensive program, though, honestly that's what I generally recommend, though it's really hard to say definitely without knowing any specifics about the program and you. I can dig it up from my previous comments, but meta-analyses of DBT show that DBT really only works if you're in treatment for at least 6 months. Do!'t get me wrong--DBT still *may* work with a shorter treatment, but it has a similar success rate (or failure rate depending on your perspective) as CBT when you stop treatment before 6 months, so statistically you're better off in a 6 month program."	annefordp	reply	na	na	na	0.004338182508945465	no	no	strong	na	dbtselfhelp

Objectively, 3 months is a significant difference than 24. 3 months seems like it’s about “getting through” the material without actually taking the time to absorb it.

"Ah, sorry--I totally accidentally read ""24 month"" as ""24 week."" A 24 month program is amazing!! The main point of the >6 month efficacy was that anything *longer* than 6 months is more effective than a short term treatment, not that *exactly* 6 months is necessary--sorry for the mix up. I was in both a short term IOP and and 2 year program as well, actually, and the skills definitely ""stick"" better in the long term program (though honestly I was very suicidal in the IOP so I wasn't really able to absorb much at all, so that may be a factor in its relative inefficacy for me). 

I do think gut feeling is pretty important in finding a therapist/program, so if you really prefer the intensive, you should go with that. At the same time you should keep in mind that in terms of general convention, the 24 month program would be regarded as preferable, so just keep it in mind as you choose.

Hi im in need of some advice from you guys. For context, I have (quiet) BPD and manage most of my symptoms pretty well. But when I'm at work, my mind gradually starts ruminating over how people perceive me, my current emotions and the emotional pain i feel. It gradually gets worse over the day and it's very hard to break for me. I also believe that these ruminating thoughts are the reason why my symptoms get worse over the day.  I know mindfulness is supposed to be helpful for that but it's not really working out for me and really painful. It takes so much of my energy that i can't do anything anymore when I'm at home. So my question is, has anyone of you experienced this and knows what could help me? I'd really appreciate any kind of support, thanks!

Definitely mindfulness is key. Tuning into the sensations in your body is how you recognize emotion mind. The sensations will probably make feelings of discomfort arise in you. I suggest mindfulness practices such as yoga or tai chi and meditation to assist with being able to tolerate the associated discomfort.

"Echoing what others have said, definitely learning to recognise how your emotions show up in your body, and learning to label them, e.g. ""My chest is tight. this is fear"" or ""I feel a pit in my stomach. this is shame"" etc.  


To add to this, you may benefit from Emotion Regulation Worksheet 4/4A. This gets you to identify the name of the emotion, the prompting event, any vulnerability factors (what happened before this? another stressful event? Did you sleep badly? etc.). Then idenitfy your interpretations (beliefs, assumptions, appraisals- basically your thoughts). Then notice changes in your face and body (what are you physically feeling?), your action urges (what do you feel like saying or doing?), Your face and body language (facial expression, postures, gestures, etc.). Then finally, noting down what you actually said, what you actually did, and the aftereffects the emotion had on you (other secondary emotions, behaviours, memories, changes to your body, thoughts, etc.)  


Once you go through all this in detail a few times for different emotions, you start to get a more specific understanding of how different emotions show up for you personally. You're not trying to change anything at this stage- just observing and describing. What happens when you're angry? Do you yell, do you shut down? etc.   


Then you're equipped with way more knowledge about your emotions, and it's easier to intervene in the moment and snap out of rationalising those emotion-mind thoughts. Because you can say to yourself ""hang on a minute. These are the kind of thoughts I get when I'm anxious/angry/sad etc. I know this because I've been through this before.

I try to think of it like a seesaw and the goal is to balance it to find what wisemind can be described as.

Does anyone know of any helpful emotion tracking apps with specific emotions (guilt, anger, fear, etc.)? It seems like every emotion tracking app I find just uses words like good, bad, awesome, etc. If there’s any way to see your pattern through time (to see if there are specific emotions associated with certain times or events) that’s a big plus too.	aphextwinification	post	12.783976054674422	male	White	0.9975094795227051	na	na	na	14	dbtselfhelp

"In the DBT worksheet from Marsha M. There's a part talking about Accumulating Positive Emotion by identifying values. All of them are important to me, if i choose one value to work on, ex: live a life of satisfaction, it clashes with ""be secure, be fit"" it clashes with "" act in my own priorities"" . 

If I'm already fit how can i keep this value and work another value at the same time? It makes me anxious and makes me not to want to think about this shit. How can I be doing things that make me happy if it contradicts with be productive? I hate myself"	polipioo	post	28.002186304006113	male	White	0.9994556307792664	na	na	na	15	dbtselfhelp
"A few thoughts:
- the work surrounding values is long-term work, and so if it's stressing you out, you may want to slow down thinking through this and shift toward the other aspects of accumulating positive emotions, like the PLEASE parts, or Build Mastery, or whatever feels right for you at the moment
- this is also an area where the concept of dialectics is important: while it's possible your core values are fundamentally in contradiction to each other (rare and pretty obvious when this is true), it's more likely that the way you're thinking about your actions, values, etc doesn't reflect the subtlety of how they interact, and you may want to approach them without judgment, and see them as tools for guidance rather than areas of concern

Ex: I use my values as a starting place to brainstorm things I may want to do for my well-being if I'm feeling that flavor of depression where nothing seems enjoyable.

In my experience in the past several years though, core values are less helpful for me to actively take actions to improve myself, and much more helpful for making decisions or approaching areas of concern for me using Wise Mind, by asking if conflict or negative emotions are coming from a contradiction with my values etc.

Tldr, this is one of DBT's long term skill areas, it's okay to not have the answers, and clarification of your core values is more intended for.s guide or reference, rather than a rubric of sorts.

But once I'm relatively stable, then it's easier for me to look at my budget and go, ""ok localmuffinwhore, you can go on that holiday"" or ""you can eat whatever you want when you go to your college reunion tomorrow.""

I think you are mixing up goals and values. You don’t accomplish values, you live them.  In your case,  a value might be independence or achievement.

"Maybe. This is a big reason I had initially scoffed at DBT when working alone, but now look back and realize how important the group weekly meetings and one on one with a trained DBT counselor are. It keeps a pace, gives you time to do homework and reflect, helps you hear perspectives on each skill from others in similar situations, and lets you meet one on one enough to work through difficulties or dive into things that are more interesting.

Studies have shown it can take 1-2yrs of practicing DBT to internalize it enough that it makes a significant difference with things like borderline and treatment resistant conditions, but if you're struggling a ton right now, I'd suggest these skills:

## Emotional Regulation Flow
| Skill | Difficulty | Usage |

## Distress Tolerance

"I think everyone will feel empty at points in their life; it's not about avoiding those, but about recognizing them as temporary, and often as common experiences across humans. DBT over time can help make you resilient, better able to get through, and introduce you to more reasons to keep going.

That's true of most forms of therapy though, for what it's worth. It's important to recognize that as you work, you aren't failing if it isn't 100% better, or if it gets better and worse, better and worse, depending.

"Hi all!

I have never encountered this feeling as an adult and don't know what to do with it.

I met a person through one of my normal social circles who deals with some mental health issues. They are a nice person, and get along well with everyone but me it feels. I am afraid of them. I understand that the things they deal with are not their fault, but the level of excitement they display and aggressive presentation of opinions comes across overly strong for me.

I know that it's not my responsibility to deal with their illnesses if I don't want to, but I do want to. I know that my worth is not a function of my ability to socialize with people that I don't want to, but I feel sad that everyone else is able to work with this person and I am not, for reasons I myself don't really even understand. I want to understand myself better, and know if avoiding this person is really as much of The Only Option as it feels like. I hate considering that possibility, even if it's what I've had to do to get along so far.

Does anyone know of any skills that specifically would help with fear in this situation? As well as any tips that might be helpful in setting firm boundaries with this person and people in general - that is a thing that I have struggled with for years. I am already in therapy for what its worth.

"I think the relationship triangle is an important thing to think about. There are a lot of assumptions, some of which could be actual. Since you’re all in a mutual friend group, you don’t need to love each other, but you do need to get along. Have a kind 1:1 conversation with the other person, don’t bring up mental illness (yours or the potential illness of the other), and share your legitimate feelings. They have a couple options on how to proceed, all of which should be safe for you (but you can’t predict or expect any particular result.) The worst case scenario is them going off the rails, in which I would greet them with kindness and compassion; further aggression would then be brought to an intermediary but the best course of action is a 1:1 conversation. 

Best case scenario you gain a friend and ally. You do not need to be a friend to the person if you don’t have the space. That doesn’t mean you can’t set boundaries for yourself and still show compassion.

"Edit: Thanks for the attempted help everyone but this is a lost cause. I have now learned typical DBT isn't the appropriate therapy for my issue, the version of DBT that could be has a an incredibly offensive blindness stereotype in the manual itself as one of the first things, and I have been so triggered by the past couple of days and the absolutely horrid response from my therapist and her hiring organization that I can't even stand to see the letters DBT. I'm glad this works for so many people. At this point I am just going to try and do the bare minimum to survive the week (the crisis line here is run by the same company and their in patient hospitals have already traumatized and failed me enough as it is, I'm not willing to call and risk having to endure that again). 

My current therapist wants me to join the local DBT group. Unfortunately due to being unable to reliably read print in the last DBT group I was in, I’m kind of traumatized from the experience and very hesitant to even consider the group. I know DBT can work for me after being part of a research project, but that was a very focused, one on one setup with things tailored to work with a blind person. My current mental health place is not able to do that for me and I’m way past having the spoons to do it for them.

"Edited to add: Ah, I'm just now seeing your update so my latest comment may not be useful at all. Just let me know if there's anything I can help with moving forward. I agree some of the DBT text is presented in a careless manner and needs revision.

Original comment: Hi again! I've drafted two out of ten figure descriptions as a test. Before I continue with the rest of the figures, please share your thoughts and don't hesitate to ask for clarifications or changes! Also, as an update, I'm not sure whether I can record these but if you think that would add value, I will try to figure that out. Anyway, the following is what I came up with.

Publication: DBT Skills Training Handouts and Worksheets, Second Edition, by Marsha M. Linehan 

Location: General Handout Seven
Figure Title: Chain Analysis
Figure Subtitle: To understand behavior, do a chain analysis.
Figure Description: A diagram with nine circles overlapping to form a chain. From left to right, the circles are labeled as follows: ""vulnerability"" connects to ""prompting event"". ""Prompting event"" connects to three sequential ""links"". The last ""link"" connects to ""problem behavior"". ""Problem behavior"" connects to three sequential ""consequences"". ""Vulnerability"", ""prompting event"", and ""problem behavior"" are emphasized through distinctive shading. End of figure description. 

Location: Mindfulness Handout Three
Figure Title: Wise Mind
Figure Subtitle: States of Mind
Figure Description: A Venn diagram with two circles overlapping. The left circle is labeled as ""reasonable mind"", the right circle is labeled as ""emotion mind"", and the overlapping space is labeled as ""wise mind"". Each state of mind points to a separate description. ""Reasonable mind"" is described as cool, rational, and task-focused. When in reasonable mind, you are ruled by facts, reason, logic, and pragmatics. Values and feelings are not important. ""Emotion mind"" is described as hot, mood-dependent, and emotion-focused. When in emotion mind, you are ruled by your moods, feelings, and urges to do or say things. Facts, reason, and logic are not important. ""Wise mind"" is described as the wisdom within each person, seeing the value of both reason and emotion, bringing left brain and right brain together, and the middle path.

"I think it depends on what your immediate problems are... and how interested you are in the material? I set aside a time slot each week (eg 1hr on sunday) and do whatever skill or worksheet feels helpful... and then throughout the week, I think about the concepts and try the skill. Use paper and pencil!!!

I think it's okay to learn a few things at the same time... like maybe big concepts like radical acceptance...and then a specific smaller skill like TIPP or something...  but in general -mindfulness- like just noting your bodily and emotional experience (emotion wheels are helpful) might be a new and helpful place to start!

"depends but google is your friend(including google scholar, ive seen medical journals describe which skills adhd benefits from for example, you can just skim to important parts or use ""find in page""/ctrl F)
i research a lot then lose those memories cuz of a disorder i have so i cant recall the best to give exact examples, i usually just remember the important stuff like the results that apply to me etc.
but a good way to start is with keywords. to start we know we wanna know ""dbt skills"" so thats a good keyword and then your possible disorders like bpd adhd aspd anything really even things that arent disorders like you could use a general behavior you wanna fix as a keyword too if you think its a behavior that applies to dbt. if you don't find anything after that then i start to add in keywords for anecdotal sources, ie reddit or quora or any forum you can think of that may apply. anecdotes tend to have people be more detailed about their specific process and what helped them compared to some shittier sites that just list general info from years ago yet will still appear on the first google page anyway.
hope this helps sorry i dont have a definitive answer of a place where stuff like that is listed cuz there isnt really one at least i haven't seen it or remember lol.
unless I'm just misconstruing what you wanted to know about, if you wanna know about the studying stuff i have only ever researched it through video format so i wouldn't know anywhere to read about it but the videos are quite concise and good for it anyway but im pretty sure you meant the part about looking for what specific skills will help you and thats just a more personal thing you can scope out with a little bit of reading in the end what matters is youre enjoying and putting yourself into learning enough to take it in.
like this is something that would be mentioned in said videos but if you dont wanna go through the work of researching just straight up read the website and just keep skimming and skipping until you find something interesting in a way you can apply to yourself and feel genuinely engaged in. this will facilitate you learning said skills faster and make it easier to go backwards and learn stuff you skipped more easily. hope you can get the improvements you want🤘"	polipioo	reply	na	na	na	0.9542875289916992	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

So growing up you dealt with dishonest family members who would claim that they forgave you but didn’t really.  That sounds really hard, I’m sorry you dealt with that.   This can be tough when you grew up having no choice but to accept dishonest behavior from your family members.  As an adult though, you have the right to reject those who aren’t honest with you.  In the future, when you run into folks who guilt trip you after having claimed they forgave you, you are well within your rights to set boundaries to protect yourself.  That kind of behavior is not acceptable and you don’t have to tolerate it.  I’d also implore you to be patient with yourself in the mean time while you heal from your abusive past.	rideinsideameatball	reply	na	na	na	0.9870002865791321	strong	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

For overwhelming emotions, there are two modules: if you're in crisis, you should use distress tolerance. But once you're no longer in crisis, you should switch to emotion regulation--identify your emotions, check the facts as needed, then use opposite action or problem solve to adjust your emotional intensity/frequency as necessary.

So there are usually two types of advanced groups--ones that meet long term, and ones that meet short term. The short term ones are usually a little like skills review, and follow a format pretty similar to your standard DBT group with a little less in-depth teaching and a little more homework sharing. The long term ones are a little like process groups, but more structured; usually there's mindfulness, then you decide as a group whose problems you'll focus on that day, and then you discuss skills that can be applied for the people who offered their issues for discussion. But basically you make an agenda at the start of group with the help of the group leader, and then you go through it.	nikitamere1	reply	na	na	na	0.01595626212656498	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
I used to be in an advanced group before I moved. We kinda lead the session ourselves. The therapist is just kinda there. We rotated who the facilitator was and who the notetaker was. We set up the agenda ourselves. We would talk about some issue that was going on in our lives and then the rest of the group would suggest skills that could potentially help. I found it really helpful to put multiple heads on the same problem and it was nice that we all had a shared therapeutic language to talk about what would apply. I thought it was great.

"I am about to graduate advanced group aka “graduate group”.
The way our format goes is we start with centering, led by one of the members. Then we have a time where anyone can ask for some time to discuss something that came up in the past week and ask for: skills coaching, problem solving, validation, reinforcement. The person asking for feed back has to identify what they need and how long they need. A different group member is responsible for being the “observer” who watched the time and let’s everyone know when time is up. Then, we have a lesson focused on skills that another group member teaches. At the end of group we assign roles for the next week and then do a wind down activity. The group leader is responsible for facilitating and contributing to the feedback and teaching portions as appropriate. 
Teaching the skills with practical examples has led to a much deeper understanding of the skills and how to apply them in my life. I am so grateful I got the opportunity to be a part of this."	nikitamere1	reply	na	na	na	0.01595626212656498	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
Is it very skills based? The one I’m in has almost no skills focus and it’s just people talking about problems and giving advice that doesn’t reference skills that often.

I can only speak from personal experience, but I found the short term advanced group very skills based--because it's really meant to review/brush up on skills, there was a theme/skill for every week (much like intro DBT courses). Honestly I preferred the long term group because I had an awesome facilitator who kept the group focused on DBT, and there was a lot more discussion on how skills work in conjunction. The short term felt a little *too* skills based for my personal taste, but I think you'll like it better if that's the experience you're looking for. It's still better than enrolling in an intro class because everyone knows (more or less) what you're talking about. If you like structure, you'll probably like short term groups.	nikitamere1	reply	na	na	na	0.01595626212656498	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I got agitated and angry at group this week, thought of different perspectives and chose to let it go. The problem is that every time I think about it I get just as angry and agitated if not more.

In group this week we were talking about dialects and walking the middle path. I shared something that happened to me this week and I was trying to understand where I did well and what else I could do to better practice my DBT.
While I was telling the story another member of the group interrupted twice not too far apart, didn’t even look at me.
Looked at the coach and said “I don’t understand how this is dialectics”.
These stressed me out about finding why it’s dialectics and walking the middle path and made me feel unsafe in group.

I was going to bring it up during the break to the coach , or to the person who disrupted me. In the end I didn’t.
I chose to think of other interpretations and how it was not intentional to make me feel bad.

The problem I’m dealing with since, is that every time I think about it the feelings come up just as strongly. I have a strong urge to call my DBT coach and speak to him about it. I’m also thinking maybe I should just bring it up to my personal DBT therapist (same office, different person).

"Your feelings are totally valid, so validate them first and foremost! It's so frustrating to be interrupted, especially during a time when you're being vulnerable. I'd feel the same way if that happened to me. And even though the person probably didn't intend any harm, you deserve to be heard and treated with respect. 

I think it would be wise to talk either your personal therapist or the DBT coach (or both). You could also choose to have a FAST conversation with the person who interrupted you to let them know you were hurt by their interruption and you'd appreciate if they'd wait for their turn to speak. Definitely talk to your therapist and/or coach first, though."	ShoulderOk5150	reply	na	na	na	0.998939573764801	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I think talking about it with both your therapists is a great idea! That's what they're there for--to be supportive. And voicing how you feel with the group leader provides a chance to clarify how to restore a neutral/safe group dynamic after your sense of safety was violated. 

If you're suppressing anger in an attempt at dialectics, I think it's also fine to ride the wave of anger if it helps you work through the emotion as long as you're not reinforcing a negative group dynamic. For example, you can complain to your friends about the situation or journal it out and let yourself recognize you feel hurt/like an injustice was done. Sometimes you just need to ride the wave to process and get over an emotion."	ShoulderOk5150	reply	na	na	na	0.998939573764801	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Update:

I’ve spoken to my personal DBT therapist about what happened.
We went over the DBT things about dealing with emotions and what are my assumptions here.
She was pretty shocked by the situation and was wondering if maybe the group leader didn’t notice what happened.
She advised me to write the group leader and explain what happened.

I wrote the group leader and he called me back.
He told me he noticed what happened and thought I was able to brush it off. He said that it clearly happened do to a lack of skills and was not personal. He said the group isn’t a perfect place and that it’s a good place to experience and practice.

I didn’t feel much closure with his answer.
I kept being like “so you think there was nothing else you could have done to help me in this situation which made me super upset?”. He was clear that he is not planning to tell someone off in group.
I kept saying I think there are other options, like coming to speak to me during break.
Then he said he thought it was annoying when it happened and was annoyed for me.

I’m not sure how I feel about the whole thing now.
I feel validated after speaking to my therapists about it, there was a part of me that felt in the wrong for sharing the wrong things.
I do see value in experiencing and learning even in group.
I also feel some unfairness, that her feelings were put above mine.

Overall I’m feeling good, not ruminating so much or even at all. My take from this is that next time this happens I will speak to my coach privately on break. I also have thoughts about expressing in group how it makes me feel in a calm and clear manner."	ShoulderOk5150	follow-up	na	na	na	0.998939573764801	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Hey all,

I've struggled with my mental health significantly since having an head injury and my team has recommended DBT to me. They're thinking cluster B personality or BDP, but given I don't have a history of personality issues prior to my brain injury they haven't sais fully if its BDP or just a crisis stress response.

I'm based in Metro Vancouver where there seem to be waitlists everywhere for comprehensive DBT services (individual and group). I've now looked at 2 options, individual counseling with a doctor level psychologist and wait for a group somewhere to open up. 2nd option go straight into a comprehensive program based a bit away in the Fraser Valley. The comprehensive program itself just started last year after the pandemic and is run by master level counselors. I can drive and live closer to the highway, so not an issue commuting for the 6 months or 1 year that is recommended. Luckily for me, funds aren't an issue for DBT programming. My family and husband just want to see me healthy again. And so I do, what do you guys recommend, individual Dr. level psychologist and wait for a group or comprehensive DBT with a counselor who's got a master's? I dont want trigger anyone with details here, but I'm concerned about how severe I've developed severe symptoms. I just want the best chance at getting better. That's why I'm almost preferring someone with PhD and extensive experience.

Some background info, I've worked as a Nurse during COVID, got married, moved countries and all the stressors adding up, I've struggled quite a bit.

"Usually comprehensive treatment is more effective. Honestly a doctorate means nothing unless you know anything about their clinical supervisor(s) and their doctorate program--for DBT, a PhD from the University of Washington Seattle is gold standard, and then there are a smattering of other really high level programs. Unless they received a PhD with DBT training specifically being a large part of their training, I would personally trust experience a lot more than a doctorate--many doctorate programs are really theory driven and look down on intervention based approaches.

That being said, if the doctorate clinician has tons of experience and rave reviews, that would probably be better than a residential program staffed with people with lesser experience."	HappyDaazed	reply	na	na	na	0.005174599587917328	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Ideally, you can work with both an individual therapist (PhD or PsyD with experience and specialization with personality disorders and trauma) and a DBT workshop leader (either Master's or doctorate, but trained in DBT). In a perfect world, both of them work closely together in the same program or practice.

I was lucky enough to enter a program more or less set up that way, and everyone I know who stuck it out for more than a year (the program is to two years) got significantly better. The first year was 8.5 hours per week (individual therapy, therapeutic group, psychoeducation in personality disorders and treatments, group workshop in DBT and medication management. The second year was individual, 1 hour of therapeutic group, one hour of DBT and 30 minutes of medication management every other week.

I started to feel more strange. I whimpered and shook. Felt like puking so much. 

I asked my wife to set a 1 hour timer so I could take my night pills. Then I started to think for a moment. In these situations I usually just curl into a ball and handle it myself. 

My brain said, No, you need help. So I texted my therapist asking for help and I texted my wife (who was in the living room) that I needed help.

"Hi, first time posting here. I had been seeing a DBT therapist for the past year and part of a weekly skills group (although had only been in that for half as long) I had in the past month decided to stop going. Felt that I was making no progress and that my therapist was not helping at all, just replaying  with platitudes or very basic advice. Without going too in deep on details, my job which had been a major locus many of my issues, my therapist just responded in the last sessions before I stopped by asking if I had considered applying for other jobs. Not sure if it was a over reaction from me but after that session I decided that this was not for me and I did not want to continue anymore. I am not sure if I made the right decision or what I should have done. I feel that every time I have a issue the standard response is use the skills and if I do not or they don't work I am told I am not doing it right.

I'm not sure if this is typical of DBT or this type of therapy, or is it the therapist? Should I go back and tell them how frustrated I am and try again (after my last session I just sent a message that I did not want to continue therapy without explaining)? Or should I seek another therapist and keep trying? Or were my actions wrong and I need to change my mindset and approach?

"Hello everyone!

I have been participating in one on one and group therapy applications of DBT skills and soothing techniques for about 8 months now. I feel that they've made a great difference in my life, but a familiar problem has reared its ugly head again.

I would describe trying to conduct business with other people as trying to overtighten a giant bolt - unstoppable force meets unmovable object. I become tense, clench my jaw, heart rate climbs, partially dissociate sometimes. This is as a reaction to excess yelling or angry-toned voices in the moment, and even just needing to call a plumber and schedule an appointment, or a tow truck when my car wouldn't start earlier this week.

I've used opposite action, and I have scripted interactions over the phone for myself in the past (small flow-chart and notes of what I need or want to ask so that I don't get confused. Are there any other skills or soothing techniques that might assist me in being able to Act when action is needed? To be able to make those phone calls without my heart in my throat?

"You’re probably tired of hearing this but mindfulness!

Anxiety is a future-focused emotion so bringing yourself to the current moment and observing it without judgement really helps.

I get phone anxiety as well because I worry that the other person might say something I didn’t anticipate, be in a bad mood , reject me, think I’m stupid… you know how it goes.

So when I have to do one of those scary phone calls I try to be very focused on the present moment. Just dialling the number, looking closely at my fingers pressing each digit (or selecting the contact from the phone book), just listening to the dial tone, just listening closely to what the other person is saying without thinking about what I should say next — you get the idea. 

Same with unexpected problems. Hardly any problem we come across day to day needs to be solved right away. Use distress tolerance skills if necessary to bring your inner tension down. Take a couple of deep breaths and first focus on understanding the problem fully, without thinking about how to solve it yet. Then go step by step trying to come up with a solution, don’t get lost on thinking about what could happen if you don’t find one. Stick to what matters in the moment.

I know mindfulness has gotten some overexposure in the wellness and productivity space so it can be a bit tiresome to hear about but it really is an incredibly valuable skill for managing emotion dysregulation. It really is worth practicing and mastering.

And yet: it works. It never occurred to me to slow down when emotion takes over in a bad way. And then it never occurred to me that there was anything to do about it. And then it never occurred to me that it would get better with practice.

I used to break electronics and other small hand-things regularly out of frustration. Just chuck whatever I'm holding at the nearest wall, then patch up the hole and buy a new widget. It's been several months now, and I've been able to modify my behavior. Is it perfect? Hell no! But it's better.

"I suppose it would be most related to me reaching out for assistance with... anything. It happens most commonly trying to conduct business -setting up appointments, paying bills - but it's also been pretty common whenever I've tried talking to anyone, under these auspices: I feel as thought the only reason people call me is if they need something (other than just my attention), because I have been having trouble calling people without having a need myself. As big as asking for help with rent, as small as seeing if someone would want to get lunch or coffee or something.

I've never really been one for idle chats, and text messaging was revolutionary for me as was email. All the sudden I felt like I had a method of communication where I wouldn't get this or that nuanced thing wrong or misinterpreted, and I could take my time to make sure I was understood.

It is a whole situation that I am working on in and out of therapy, but it's really *felt* much worse lately. Like literally (used correctly) staring at the phone for 15 minutes trying to will myself into picking up the phone (opposite action, perhaps used incorrectly) because I don't feel like I can do so willingly at this time? And I essentially have my phone on mute at all times right now as hearing it make any noise seems to be some sort of trigger; I immediately tense up, whether its a ring, or an email or text chime.

I’m just now emerging from this state after a year of intense weekly dbt based trauma therapy and dbt skill classes. I had to do a lot of skills forcefully, meaning I was always willing but wouldn’t be able to execute and follow through without a lot of grit and white knuckling it. Over time habits were formed and these skills became more like habits and even needs for me. If I do not practice mindfulness now, I feel very off. It’s almost uncomfortable. I’ve created a lot of new, healthier ways to cope. Don’t get me wrong, I’m still in deep, but those awwwwful feelings I know you have… they’re better now. I finally feel like I can make real changes in my life. I wish you well OP.	Electronic_Ad_7348	reply	na	na	na	0.003384819021448493	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Radical Acceptance 

Accepting your reality, right now - Not how it was, or what it might be.  But right in this moment, you can only think “my reality ‘is what it is’ at the moment.  I can’t improve or change it.  I’m gonna accept it and go find joy elsewhere.”

Meditation, exercise, taking your meds, drinking water, eating well and weekly therapy sessions will help you get there consistently.

You can do it!  We can do hard things.  

The DISTRESS TOLERANCE section of DBT therapy helps with the crisis moments.  Radical Acceptance is just one the ~20 Distress Tolerance skills to use.  This link will take you to all you need to learn & more.

"The process is anything DBT for me is trial and error to find what's effective....which sounds terrible when it comes to suicidal ideation 🤣🤣🤣
For that though, I rely heavily on opposite action and distraction as they are natural defences I've programmed infor these moments. I still get those kinda thoughts daily. A recent thing I've been doing when I can get back to a wise mind is radical acceptance and turning the mind to acknowledge this is a distress response to something happening in my environment and looking for what it is. 
When I find it, I move onto a chain analysis to find why it caused me that level of distress, 
then use GIVE with myself, 
followed by looking for where I am at fault in that environment causing me to be distressed with dialectical thinking (devil's advocate for the chain analysis to have “eventual consistency” on the cause), 
then figuring out how to use DBT skills to stop the vulnerability influencing my emotional mind to “take over”. 
This is a long and intense process that got easier and reflexive but it's so the triggers don't continue to be one. I can keep myself alive and from giving in, but I don't even want that to be a daily struggle so I tried a bunch of things and this process is what is working for me so far. There's wiggle room for what the cause is as what works for interpersonal things may not work for emotional regulation or from one environment to the next. 

One part that helps is having access to exercises to do these things. I use the DBT coach app for this and handy information to review when I need to know a certain skill, as I always have my phone on me and a power brick as a backup. I'd recommend when you find your process, create a template of the exercises in one document or place, then make sure you can access it 24/7. Print it, save it to your phone, your desktop, where ever is somewhere you feel comfortable writing this stuff down. 

Also, don't beat yourself up if you don't follow through with the process. Instead, look for the resistance and try finding a way to reduce it or change things.

I’m recently separated and I have two toddlers. My s/o and I do want some sort of romantic relationship but our individual mental health and her busy schedule gets in the way. I can’t use the dbt skills to end the relationship as she’s the mother of my kids and we’ve both been pretty involved parents. We generally don’t argue when it comes to actual parenting but we can’t seem to get the fundamental parts of a basic social relationship right. For example, most of the discussions get out of hand when discussing acknowledgment, validation etc which seem to happen when I use Fast. She has ideas that don’t quite align with dbt and I’m happy for her to operate within them, just not expect me to agree. If I don’t use fast, everything is fine. My boundaries are pretty aligned within dbt and I try to stick within them, so it’s not like I’m asking for her to take on some sort of support role in my therapy. when I try to use fast, I get told I’m being threatening, avoiding accountability or generally intense. I don’t expect her to follow or know anything about dbt, just respect that is how my behaviour is aligned and what to expect. A lot is being misunderstood and not been given a chance to clarify. These arguments are affecting both of our behaviour and I can see why but I can’t seem to communicate effectively how she is asking for me to do things that are detrimental to my self respect. It’s met with a lot of judgement and invalidation of how I feel, think or experience things.

"If you're in DBT then you might be like me.  I will sometimes spiral and want a divorce.  I get stuck in my own logic and believe that there is no way to improve the relationship given the conversations we've been having lately where I'm not receiving validation, reassurance, or resolution.  When I'm in that state of mind, I am very blunt with him and tell him how I'm in divorce mode and it hurts his feelings.  He has to help me through that state of mind til we can get to a point where we work on how to handle the situation.  It's not fair to believe it's all his problem and he's the only one that needs to change.  I have to make changes too.  It's why I'm in therapy.  I can't let a bad day dictate the status of our relationship.

I wouldn't rely on a single skill you look up after posting on reddit to help you through this.  This sounds like a job for couples therapy. DBT helps you navigate relationships sure.  But it's not a one size fits all and you'll need a couples therapist that can find the tools you need for the unique relationship you have.  Certain skills in DBT may work for you, but the relationship will need it's own skills.  It might be DBT, CBT, CFT, etc or a combination. I hope you're both receptive to working on this as a team.

Can you give more details on how you are using FAST? What did you say, and what was your tone of voice and body language like? 

FAST and GIVE can be used together. Perhaps it could be effective for you to do both at once, if she is feeling invalidated when you use FAST. You can validate both of you — that’s dialectics. :)

"I haven’t spoken to her in person since we have been “fighting”. She is refusing multiple requests for us to talk about boundaries. 
I’ve only recently started to appreciate the difference on how much to lean on each skill in a message.

The argument from my perspective is stupid and is dissolved into dissecting my communication from a non-dbt perspective while I try to use give (through mirroring) and fast to acknowledge that yeah I can see how she might see it that way, but it’s not the intent behind my message and offering clarification/correction, while asking for a time for us to talk about boundaries. I’ve been intense and persistent asking as my reasoning is to prevent patterns (we both are aware of transactional analysis theory) that cause arguments. Such as her being upset and pushing me away when I say no to a request I’m not actually capable of in a given moment or conflicts with my current understanding of dbt (I’m 6 months in and I’m not gonna try say I’m perfect at this).  

Every time I say no or use fast, it’s just simply not effective and I get dismissed, invalidated and/or told that I’m being unreasonable/hurtful. 

I do the same script every time (I don’t know how else I can be effective). I validate through mirroring her problem/request, I offer a correction or say no to the request if the dime game says I should, I stand my ground and say no, this is why I can’t and repeat the facts, then get accused of being argumentative or defensive (using fast, you generally have to be defensive if your standing up for yourself). And then it dissolves into her picking apart my reasoning/facts or she threatens abandonment (won’t engage with me).

"Hmm, thank you for sharing. It sounds difficult. Not being in person adds another layer of challenge, too. Some thoughts: 

- When you are saying no, perhaps you could do some problem solving and help her find an alternate solution to the problem. 

- Also, if she interprets something you say as hurtful, even if you didn’t intend it that way, it could be good to work to correct (if it is not against your boundaries) that in addition to validating that it was hurtful. 

- If saying no or using fast isn’t effective, what is effective? Is there something that has worked in the past? Or has nothing been effective? Also, what does effective mean to you in this context? What is your goal? 

>I do the same script every time 

- I would not say the exact same thing each time, if that’s what you mean. Saying the same thing can come off as ingenuine and not understanding or listening (even if that’s not the reality) 

- Are you in individual DBT therapy? This would be a great thing to discuss there 

- If you’re interested in another type of therapy / framework, Non-Violent Communication (r/NVC) can be helpful for interpersonal situations. Basically, you try to identify what you and someone else are needing.

"Can anyone recommend skills to practice that might help with negative thinking right after waking up?

"Hi everyone!

I wanted to share an idea my therapist and I came up with. 

She gave me a jar, and some magazines to decorate it (you can use stickers, washi tape, scrap book paper). I found a cute bunny that brought me joy. Then she told me to fill up the jar with something every time I practice Dialectical Abstinence.

If you don’t know, Dialectical Abstinence is a Distress Tolerance skill having to do with addiction (DT Handout 17/17A) It’s working on abstinence from problem behaviors, particularly drugs and alcohol. I am currently abstaining from cannabis.

So, the post it notes correspond with Urge Surfing. Green is for 5 minutes, yellow for 15min, pink for 1 hr. And blue will eventually be for days when I start abstaining full days. 

On each post-it note I write the date, my emotion, and what skills/activities I did instead of the problem behavior. 

Seeing all the colors and how full the jar gets helps me visualize that I *can* and *have* stayed sober through tough emotions. 

Hope this idea helps!"	thebpdpanda	post	28.985872641666347	female	White	0.0017793533625081182	na	na	na	12	dbtselfhelp

I’ve really been struggling recently about my lack of progress. I’ve been in therapy for almost 1.5 years and have been through group and am still self harming and spiraling. I know it’s my fault. I know all the skills and just choose not to use them sometimes because whether I cut or don’t doesn’t make me not have made the mistake that triggered me. I’m a shitty human regardless of how I cope. I was so hopeful at the beginning of therapy and group that I would be better but I’m just…not. My therapist is frustrated with my lack of progress, too, and it’s not her fault that I’m too willful to really pull it off. I am paying more than I can afford for therapy, so shouldn’t I just quit? I’m a little in emotion mind right now (obviously), but it’s a thought I’ve had even when less triggered. I just feel like a failure.	thevarietyshows	post	30.06138490439861	male	White	0.9990660548210144	na	na	na	5	dbtselfhelp
"I think therapy is hard, if it was easy therapists wouldn’t be a thing and you would already have done it yourself.

Sometimes you have to try a few different thing, or even the same thing multiple times before you find your solution. I’ve worked with people who have gone through years of group, left and then turned up again a year or two later. It’s ok to take a break to try and work out what you want and this doesn’t make you a failure. 

From a therapy point of view, it hasn’t been time wasted because you’ve learned the skills and the language. You said you just choose not to use them. But I think that’s only part of the story. Rather than just ploughing on ahead with skills It might be worth sitting down by yourself and with a therapist to think about what’s stopping you from using the skills, is the pain serving a function I wonder. Is that why it’s hard to let go of. These are the questions I’d encourage you to explore with a therapist. 

I say “a therapist” because you could try another for a different perspective. Sometimes that’s not a bad thing if you want to try it. You can’t see both at once but you could seek a second opinion. 

You decide what you need. But whatever you choose it doesn’t make you a failure.

There’s no failure in DBT. It’s about timing. Maybe it’s not time for you to take self harm off the table. I think acceptance around that is important. The skills are most helpful when you are ready to use them and willing. It may be wise minded to pause and reconsider when you are more willing and ready. It’s not about failing. Life is a series of transactions and perhaps your time is the next transaction. There is likely a reason why it’s hard to let go of something that has been dependable for you.	thevarietyshows	reply	na	na	na	0.9990660548210144	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I think it may be a good idea to talk with your therapist about this before trying to come to any fixed decision.  


A way of thinking about it that could support you in this conversation could be to use the problem solving skill. When we do problem solving with DBT, we do it very methodically and first try and identify what is the problem, what needs to be done to feel like progress on the problem has been achieved, and then brainstorming as many solutions as possible, doing the pros and cons of the best ones, then trying them out.  Sometimes in a situation like this, our emotions can tell us that we only have one option for solving the problem (e.g. quit therapy), but very often we have many more options available to try before the ""last resort"" option."	thevarietyshows	reply	na	na	na	0.9990660548210144	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I mean I think it’s a good idea to question whether this is the right person to teach you. So many people seem to say that DBT is easily learned and I find this to be extremely invalidating. 

But, what’s more, I think that with a therapist it’s easy to get caught in Sunk Cost Fallacy, meaning one has invested money and it’s not working but they feel they have to continue. Not everyone takes to a therapist well enough to be effective. Your therapist, imo, should not be be “frustrated” with your “lack of progress.” They should alter their approach. If they can’t, it’s worth finding someone else. 

My previous skills group leader was a bit dismissive of my lived experiences and that created willfulness in me. So I often just fucked off. My current one is much more willing to listen to me and doesn’t give me any feelings of inadequacy or that my experiences or not valid. 

Here’s what they said in response to some of the things you said:

I am glad to hear you are using reminders to review the book and skills.
Please review and complete some of the skills application for the Shifting Thoughts with Reason Cognitive Modification skills we discussed in last session.
Also, the following skills could be helpful in the interim along with other Distress Tolerance skills: Accepts, Self-soothe, Radical Acceptance pg. 92, Willingness pg. 96, Emotions on a Continuum pg. 118 (try to find/recognize middle ground moods that aren’t only extremes or peak intensities), Changing Relationship to Emotions pg. 119, Mindfully “Holding” Emotions pg. 120.
I’ll see you soon. And remember, work the skills. Keep at it even when they don’t “work” automatically. The Eiffel Tower wasn’t built overnight. You got this, even if you don’t feel or think you do. Because those are only feelings and thoughts, not necessarily facts, truths or absolutes.

Self-compassion is the antidote to feeling shame. I highly suggest a daily self-compassion practice. That has been game changing for me. Also remember the assumptions. You’re doing the best you can.

"About a week ago I came across the six steps of validation. They are very useful for dealing with others and also for self-validation. Basically you are validating how ‘understandable’ our reactions are considering what has happened to us in our life. It doesn’t mean we ‘approve’ the behaviors, it means that it us ‘understandable’ that we have them. Our reactions have protected us (even if they were made when we had fewer internal resources) and so it is understandable that we melt down, yell, abuse our partner, and need hours to calm down and re-regulate. 

Also, it is compassionate and possibly helpful to validate a partner who is dysregulated. 

This ten minute video outlines the process. 

I highly recommend the book:
 Loving Someone with Borderline Personality Disorder: How to Keep Out-of-Control Emotions from Destroying Your Relationship 

It explains so much of what we are going through and is helpful because it can be applied to ourselves! We are literally loving someone (us) with out of control emotions! And if our partner also suffers from out of control emotions it will be doubly helpful!

Good luck!

"Hey I just want to gently challenge you on this. The skills taught in DBT need to be learned by everyone. Some people are taught it in early childhood by their caregivers, some have caregivers who were never taught the skills themselves, some have a biological make-up which makes it easier for them to learn the skills and some have the opposite and it's harder for them to learn.

I started DBT group therapy last year. I did a 9 month course and showed up very ineffectively but I also didn’t have a therapist at the time and was newly diagnosed and in and out of crises. 

I just completed a 6 month course with a different group and am staying for another 6 months. I have a fantastic therapist but unfortunately I still struggle to show up willingly despite her efforts to brainstorm ways to turn my mind.  I know DBT skills are there to help me and that I chose to join but I freeze up every single time no matter how much I cope ahead. It’s a mix of anxiety, frustration, embarrassment, and irritability. I don’t know how to show up effectively and participate appropriately. It’s so frustrating bc I understand if I can learn and practice these skills, I’ll eventually learn how to manage and cope with my emotions in a healthier way but there is some invisible barrier that gets in the way as soon as the zoom starts. Exposure is obviously not working. 

Any tips, tricks, or advice?"	SmellyPetunias	post	23.767543787649153	female	White	0.9992252588272095	na	na	na	7	dbtselfhelp
Great job at showing up to the sessions themselves, it's the hidden important step. Even if you feel you are not participating effectively, to be able to just login is a BIG effort.  Do you feel a sudden onset of overwhelming feelings when you start any of these group sessions? Do you have the same experience with personal 101 therapy? Also, think. When you are talking to people, do you usually find your mind wander and glaze over what is being said, especially when it's a heavy handed topic or explanation or discussion of any mental health topics?

"It’s possible that the group setting might not be the best choice for where you are right now in your journey, but it’s also possible that you can work through this issue and be able to participate more in the group. Don’t forget to be compassionate to yourself and where you are at right now in your journey. 

I personally struggle with being overstimulated by emotions and also by certain types of social situations, because I am a HSP (highly sensitive person) and it takes me time and mental energy to process emotions beyond what is “normal.” It’s estimated about 20% of people are HSP’s, so the concept of normal is based on the 80% of people who are not highly sensitive. So throughout my life I have been made to feel that I am overly distracted by emotions, conflict, subtleties in an environment etc. but honestly, I don’t think there is anything wrong with me - it’s helpful to have people around who notice things and feel deeply. So maybe you are one of us? 

I’ll be honest, I personally didn’t do group DBT because of the issues you mention - I was very fortunate and was able to access a provider who did DBT with me in a 1:1 setting. This worked well for me - I still dealt with overwhelm and slow processing time when I was experiencing emotions during session, but I had less to process (only one person there in the room with me). 

I do think you can work through your “willfulness” as they say in DBT and participate in the sessions. One question I’d have is - is it easier for you to practice the skills on your own rather than in group? Figuring that out might help you isolate where the issue lies.

"I’m about to be kicked out of my DBT program for these kinds of issues. I struggle with the homework and I haven’t had an easy time with my therapist. They put me on a plan that even if I show up, my missed homework counts as a missed class. 

The class is nearly empty, and the idea of being on this stupid plan has been another mental hurdle. I’ve always been one to be bad at doing homework, but good on tests. I just don’t have anyone to practice this stuff with. Often times, I won’t speak to anyone in between my appointments. I get overwhelmed going over conversations I had before. Idk, I feel like it’s a losing battle. 

I need to do my assignment in the next 10 hours or I’m kicked out. Ugh. I just don’t know if I’ll ever have another opportunity to be in the course later.

Thank you. The act of showing up is extremely challenging each and every time and sometimes I don’t make it. Participating and actively listening is exponentially more difficult. I do have these similar feelings when it comes to individual as well and I’m doing that twice weekly. Individual is just slightly less anxiety inducing and it being in person helps in comparison to online group. I get full on panic before group and individual abs although I still show up, the feelings don’t abate. My anxiety makes it difficult to concentrate and process the information, then I often get irritated with other group members when they ramble on and my willfulness gets in the way of the mindfulness practice. I also feel too vulnerable to share and/or that I’ll sound stupid or didn’t do simmering right. I wish it was easier so I can fully embrace it. I don’t know how to not have my emotions control me and I get that’s what DBT is for but I’m not getting anywhere and that’s frustrating. But thank you for your thoughtful response.

Thanks for the reply.  My therapist and psychiatrist tell me over and over to be compassionate to myself. I literally don’t know how to do that. I added that the group setting probably isn’t best for me but I have to accept that that’s how DBT is run. It’s difficult to find a therapist that does strict DBT, so I need to rely in group at the moment. I’m most definitely a highly sensitive person and very easily overstimulated. Unfortunately I’m terrible at motivating myself or teaching myself things so practicing DBT on my own without structure just wouldn’t happen. I get too distracted or bored.

"I am speaking from the experience of working with my spouse in her DBT classes and also, over the years, understanding how the brain works in a C-Ptsd or dysregulated mode and how it shows up in her struggles. The challenges you describe are exactly the same as she experiences till today. Her circuitry gets overwhelmed as you described. Turns out growing up with a naggy single traumatized mother really put her mind in a sensitive *annoyed* state where she would incessantly instruct here to do this and that and her coping mechanism automatically became *tuning herself out*.

So on a mere whiff of a debate or a group or anyone who seems to trigger her in a way that an overloading mom would ( even if the other person means well), she tunes out, focus drops and her mind starts living her home. This is just a rough example to show how this instinct of anxious blurry mind response happens. Dysregulation results when a child or adult is not allowed to be relaxed and free by the environment so the nervous system is always in a unsoothed survival mode. For a long time I failed to see that she was like this 24x7, whereas I had a picture of mental health where it occurs in only episodes.

What works is just time and a relentless effort at just showing up for the sessions or rather showing up for yourself. Things may not seem coherent, triggers will continue to happen. It won't be just this DBT session. She is learning to calm down her nervous system. The goal of DBT or any therapy is not just teaching new ways of thinking. You cannot be taught that, you are already *it*. It's just to tell your mind that the state that discomforted you no longer exists, so your mind would gradually be at ease.. That means less anxiety, clearer head, the good parts of your brain will take over ( like it does when you do something you truly love to do, I am sure there are lots of things you enjoy) and the fuzziness and flee-feelings will become manageable. It takes time. We are in 3rd year of CBT and she has done 3 rounds of DBT already. So take it easy. Keep learning about yourself and the rhythms of your body. All we have to do in this life is to attempt to feel soothed and happy. Keep on doing the great work. There is hope.

"Don’t worry - being compassionate to yourself comes with time. I really struggled with that at first too (I remember thinking “I don’t know how to do that” just like you said). It gets easier with practice and a desire to do it. 

Oh, and one thing I forgot to say is that I ended up feeling a bit like I actually missed out on group, myself, because I missed out on the validation of seeing other people struggle with the same things as me.

"The standard treatment for phobias is exposure therapy, which is also the treatment DBT advises: opposite action. Remember that the critical component of opposite action is to **acknowledge and validate your fears**, but act opposite of those fears anyway. It requires tremendous bravery, but it's been proven to treat phobias very effectively. If opposite action is too much, you should start with check the facts, but opposite action is the ultimate goal, and the actual part of the therapy that will alleviate the phobia. 

PTSD flashbacks are a completely different and much more complicated matter. Personally I think it's hard to treat PTSD with *only* DBT, but the skills to use for these would be: mindfulness (flashbacks are fundamentally a dissociative state, and mindfulness alleviates that), checking the facts, self soothing skills (distress tolerance). In the long term, the PTSD in general would need be treated for flashbacks to disappear to the level it no longer impedes QOL, and that requires almost every DBT skill, in my personal experience. 

PTSD especially is a complicated beast, and phobias are clinically simple but it feels overwhelming to treat because of how treatment involves facing your worst fears. Wishing you healing on both!"		reply	na	na	na	0.008056174032390118	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Hello fellow DBT practitioners,

I don't believe diagnoses matter too much but for the sake of simplification, I describe myself as a recovered BPD person who no longer displays the behavior that would bring me to BPD territory, but still struggle a lot with the internal factors of BPD, such as extreme sensitivity to emotions, rejection sensitive dysphoria, etc. The problem I'm focusing on currently is my unstable sense of self.

The underlying problem is (as it is with many of us) that I have extremely low self worth and self confidence. The good news is that I'm surrounded by a wealth of very supportive people who see a lot of potential in me, and are very gracious with my missteps in life. I've been trying to analyze it and I think the fundamental problem is that there is a conflict in me between the way I view myself and the way others view me, which are incongruous with one another.

The results of this include but are not limited to: 1) extreme dependence on the praise and validation of others, because it's the only way I derive a positive sense of self worth, 2) narcissistic behavior when I feel unworthy (as a defense mechanism) and/or when I've been validated a lot (e.g. I get glowing performance reviews from several supervisors all at once), and 3) honestly the worst part is that I feel this wreaks emotional havoc on my life--I can oscillate wildly from thinking I'm a genius to thinking I'm worthless several times in a few hours, and it leaves my psyche tired, if that makes any sense.

Anyway, I'm trying to break this pattern, and I know this problem of unstable self-identity is pretty common with BPD. Any suggestions or stories on how you solved this?

Also as a secondary question/advice sought: my current plan is to practice check the facts/opposite action to happiness (only in the instance of feeling manically happy in response to validation), and to keep working on loving kindness. I already do a lot of fact checking/opposite action to shame, fear, and anger toward myself, but I think that these feelings of grandeur and the following crash are really my biggest problems at the moment. Any modifications/evaluations of this plan? Yay or nay?

"Honestly for me, approaching it dialectically.   


It's somewhat counter intuitive, but the more I let go of the feeling like I ""should"" have an internal constant sense of self, the more secure I feel in myself. Instead of trying to construct some unchanging identity that I can point to and say ""that's me"", embracing the confusion of selfhood being this ever changing, fluid, process. I am not the same person I was 5 years ago. Everything that is ""me"" is a product of interaction with the world over the course of a lifetime. An accumulation of history, events, relationships, communities, emotions, bodily processes that all coalesces to form ""me"" in this present moment. The water in my body was once clouds. The minerals in my bones was once in the earth. ""I"" am connected to everything in the universe. Why do I need to cut myself off from that by carving out some rigid definition of myself that will be out of date soon enough anyway? I really find comfort in approaching this issue with a sense of, who I am is already fascinating enough, complex enough, important enough, valuable enough, just from the fact that I am here alive right now typing this.

"Maybe I'm on the wrong track with advice here, but similar to you I no longer really meet the diagnostic criteria for BPD but struggle with emotional and rejection sensitivity. 


I would say I now have a strong sense of self, and the best tool was opposite action. I used to be very dependent on other people for doing things that I wanted. Im very outdoorsy, so one thing I would do was ask someone to go on a hike with me and I would promise myself that even if they say no, I have to go anyway. Overtime, doing things that I enjoyed alone built my confidence and sense of self to the point where I finally have okay self esteem. 


With opposite action I would also cope ahead. Say I went got a hike alone, I'd think about how I would cope with loneliness on that hike - that set me up for success because I already had a written plan on my phone for steps on how to calm myself down.

I feel like I'm *too* fluid and let my self-identity be completely shaped by the moment, and that makes me very emotionally unstable."	localmuffinwhore	follow-up	na	na	na	0.006132954731583595	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
It is to me. The idea of doing something anyway and having that be a conduit to self acceptance seems easy to enact. I think I could actually do it.	localmuffinwhore	reply	na	na	na	0.006132954731583595	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
I get what you're saying and I relate a lot to what you're describing. I guess what I mean is that, the opposite action to looking for external validation could kinda be to learn to validate yourself internally. So instead of basing your self worth on things like an achievment, a job, other people's opinions of you etc, just observing yourself as you are in a very ordinary non-spectacular way and validating thatt, validating your emotions and experiences in everyday life. When you observe yourself like that, I guess it is kind of like meditating, you notice all these different things about yourself idk, the way you like to sit, the way you move around, what it feels like in each moment to be you, and how this is always changing. The stuff about thinking about the clouds and the earth etc, this is just a zoomed out perspective that makes it easier for my to practise thinking about myself differently, as not just a person but an object in time. The kind of permanence of self that we can crave so much, i think that is a difficult thing to strive for when we and the world around us are in a cosntant state of flux. This change IS the constant. We are all full of contradictions. For example, I like being at loud concerts, AND I get sensory overload around loud noises and like peace and quiet. Sometimes I am brash and loud AND sometimes I am reserved and timid. It's kind of like learning to accept yourself and all the different sides of yourself, some of which you might not like but all of which are part of you, and recognising them when you nottice them in yourself and validating them, and recognising the inherent goodness within yourself- not from any special achievment, but simply from your own imperfect humanity. I'm sorry if I haven't explained this very well, I guess people have been figuring this out for thousands of years in bhuddism for example and if there was a shortcut to it someone would have found it by now haha	localmuffinwhore	reply	na	na	na	0.006132954731583595	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

PLEASE do not suggest changes to my eating and exercise lifestyle without knowing my circumstances or if I have a history with disordered eating. Please never suggest to anyone that they count calories.

Please also reflect on the example you gave— if I am overwhelmed by self judgement around my looks, none of your suggestions address judgement and self acceptance.

It takes a lot of time and effort, especially when you're in this by yourself, but I would say it is worth it.

"I highly recommend Shari Y. Manning’s book “Loving someone with borderline personality disorder”. She is a therapist who ‘loves’ working with suicidal female Bpd teens although that us not who this book is for.

And what makes this book, so great is that it is written for the partner of someone with BPD and so it painstakingly explains everything in great detail about BPD and DBT. Not only that, but the skills to get along with someone with BPD can be used on oneself! 

In particular, and I’m only in the first chapter or two, there is a large emphasis on validation, and how to do it. I’ve started to use a lot of the validation techniques on myself. 

The other thing that I’ve been doing is looking up relevant skills on YouTube and learning them that way. My anger and inability to regulate myself at times is my main target behavior. So those are the skills I am focusing on now in addition to reading Shari Manning‘s book .

I was 30 when I struggled and it’s been 3 years now and I’ve gotten only a handful into habit now for being able to calm down before crisis strikes. Be patient and kind to yourself knowing that depending on your age cognitive change is fucking challenging especially when you leaned behaviors over time.

"Practice makes perfect, so it is said.

I hated it at the start. Everything seemed so stupid. I don't need an acronym to tell me to not jump to conclusions or over-commit to actions; that's crazy!

It was impossible at first. What do you mean stop? I need to get this done! I have places to be and things to do I don't have time for this shit! Get the fuck out of my way - once this is done I can relax. Not before! NEVER BEFORE!

And yet. Here I am. STOP saves my ass several times a day.

The biggest tip that my last group came to consensus on was the value of practicing while you know you are operating in wise mind. The reason for the truth of the phrase ""Fake It Til You Make It"" is in **the building of new habits and the dissolution of old habits**. By performing in a particular way, one adapts to that performance, and doing so can become secondary nature. Even things people hate, like Customer Service jobs, can be adapted to in a productive and self-progressive fashion.

By practicing your soothing and defusal techniques while in Wise Mind, you can associate the feeling of *being* in Wise Mind with the practice of those techniques. It can be a helpful extra boost to calming down and proceeding mindfully, and additionally it gives you a method to apply what Wise Mind feels like to every day situations; by practicing your skills in Wise Mind, you are training yourself to recognize how that state feels vs Logical or Emotional Mind, which in turn gives you context to recognize when your emotions are taking the reins so to speak.

To your last sentence: I don't want to say nail on the head, because looking at things through a Dialectic point of view has been absolutely crucial to me healing and being able to work on returning to every day life. Having the ability to contextualize seeing things as existing in the grey instead of solely black or white pre-judgement is likely the biggest gain I've had from a DBT vs CBT approach.

But yes. There's a large part of DBT which is the practice and utilization of skills, *to the end of*  being able to approach the world in a more controlled fashion. For me, I might phrase it as ""Gaining these tools and the ability to consciously seek out the grey between the black and white has given me a much better ability to handle addressing the root causes of my maladies."""

Yup! I came here to say this. There's a DBT concept of Willful vs. Willing, and Willfulness is common when emotionally dysregulated or under a lot of stress. It's hard to completely remove from your life, but it's definitely something that improves with time and practice. For me personally, noticing how obnoxious I found other people being willful made me start realizing it and fixing it in my own life.

I didn’t learn of this yet! It’s helpful there’s terms for it and to know it’s a common thing in the beginning. I actually did the pros/cons of acting on crisis urge Vs the advantages disadvantages of resisting crisis urge and keep it on my computer screen so it’s always there if I get triggered.

Really? When I’m in an episode there is always this awareness but it doesn’t help because I’m still “stuck” in it no matter how badly I want it to end and be over. Yet I want to be miserable cause otherwise it’s “not fair.” It feels like I’m dying and I just have to wait it out while trying not to be impulsive and hurt anyone. So if I’m not just “over it all” and thinking everything is BS- I am desperate for any help, any skill to get through it and make it end faster. I want out and before I just didn’t know what to do in those states of mind and energy. OR, I am hyper focused on devaluing FP. Then the skills will be neglected and forgotten.

"Yes, so, something they often don't tell you is that DBT can be very intense, and confusing at times. If you have other diagnosises like being neurodivergent it may not help you in the same ways as well, just a heads up. 

I did 3 years of DBT have ADHD and Autism and am good 90% of the time and can use skills and all that. But I still don't really know what to do with emotions that fit the facts.. besides just doing opposite action which, sometimes I feel like I'm entitled to feel a fit the facts level of emotion. However, when I have an autistic meltdown there's completely no way I can use skills as the meltdown is coming from a different functioning part of the brain. The Autism diagnosis was actually brought up by my DBT team lol. 

So it can be very confusing at first and even after, but take what you can from it, and even small successes are huge. The fact that just a pros/cons list helps you most days is so awesome! Once you get more and more skills and more and more of an understanding about them, you'll extremely reduce damaging behaviors and thoughts, and will be able to identify and sit in the emotions as to not make things worse or do more damage. 

You got this! It's a hard road but you already did the hardest part which is starting!"	Content_Sail6271	reply	na	na	na	0.006696428172290325	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"We’re going to be different, of course. I am probably much, much newer at it all than you, but I can say with certainty that as I was going through the thing yesterday, I didn’t think of DBT other than to dismiss it as useless. I didn’t try to think about individual skills. 

I don’t really flip into devaluing my FP. Instead, I become self-destructive and say the most vicious things to myself. I blame myself for weakness(?), for being in the same position repeatedly, for not being able to handle it on my own, for being 52 and still reliving trauma, and whatever else I can do to hurt myself. I don’t cut physically, but this is the same thing after a fashion. Part of my willfulness—which I wouldn’t have called what I was doing until I saw responses to your post—is to stay in the bad spot because I deserve the pain and, contrary to what one might think, it feels GOOD. 

I’ve been in a bad spot so much these last couple of weeks that I feel utterly hopeless… and I think I like it there. I deserve it.

"Hi! Thanks for asking, I don't mind answering.

I was diagnosed bipolar at 17. That came with very clear physical symptoms that I still feel today. I don't generally suffer from full blown manic episodes, usually they are more hypomanic. In contrast, I was diagnosed with BPD about two years ago. so I am still sort of processing and working through and learning about my symptoms there. But I am learning more.

For me, when it's a symptom related to bipolar, it feels more...physical, if that makes any sense? The beginning stages of mania or hypomania for me manifest as a very real physical sensation that I am a bobblehead and someone is shaking me pretty hard. My thoughts are uncontrollably and uncomfortably fast, I am severely irritable, I am talking and thinking and moving very fast, and I feel like I have very little control. Now that I am in DBT, the best way I can explain it is that, for me, bipolar symptoms feel very, very present in the body, and they feel as if I couldn't be skillful even if I tried. Confidence feels false and exaggerated. Anger feels like Hulk is waiting to come out. It doesn't feel like I'm in crisis, even though I am; it feels more like a runaway train about to slam into a wall and you can see the wall but you cannot stop it. And then when I crash, I crash straight into depression. Barely get out of bed, don't eat, lots of crying...it feels sort of physically unbearable and that is what makes it me really frustrating, because there is a brain-body connection that for me is very defined. 

What I have learned with the BPD is that the symptoms are, for me, much more heart/feeling based. It feels supremely physical in my body, but the BPD symptoms not only feel more mental, they feel much more painful because it doesn't feel like anything is happening in my body other than maybe anxiety. It really feels more...mentally and emotionally devastating. I also notice that when the issue is BPD related, skills are helpful in .instigating symptoms. I can sort of mentally work through the problem.

Keep in mind, my experience is unique just as yours is and everyone else's. For instance, I also have PTSD, so I deal with lots of flashbacks, dissociation, etc. That affects the way some things manifest and occasionally I have a hard time telling if I am just dealing with really intense emotions or if I'm experiencing the beginning of mania. One of the things that helps me determine which is giving me the trouble is, I do PLEASE and check if I have been regularly taking my medication, sleeping with my. CPAP mask, eating, hydrating, and caring for my diabetes. I find that if I forget my tegretol consistently, within a couple of days I'm very shaky, overwhelmed, overstimulated, and about ready to throw impulse control out the window. That's when I know I am in danger.

Everyone is different, of course. As you get to know each aspect of your conditions, you will be able to tell what is true for you with which condition. Practicing DBT skills regularly can help you become more attuned to your body and learn which symptoms for you mean which condition is flaring up.

I love you and I see you. I hope this helps. It's a pretty scary thing when you are told you have both BPD and bipolar, but it's very manageable if you do what you need to. I have a husband and three kids under the age of 10. It's a lot of work and many times situations or circumstances have triggered stuff. Take care of yourself and have a trusted support system to help. Wishing you light and strength. We can do hard things ❤️."

This is based off my own experience, and based on that I think DBT could really help you! Sometimes it was hard for me to keep up during groups. Since it was so much to absorb, and I learned that is ok. Actually it seemed to be challenging for everyone to a certain degree, and that was ok if it was. We had worksheets to practice. I would sometimes go to the public library to get photocopies of a worksheet to practice a skill with. That way I could have a master copy, instead of using up the original page only once.

"I can certainly try.

Let's take my afternoon yesterday. My headphones wouldn't work while I was doing dishes. They're a newish pair of bluetooth headphones, which I haven't used before (I'd say I'm a technophobe, but severe anger is more the theme than fear, there).

So. I'm sitting and staring at my phone, and these headphones, wondering why they won't pair. They did it the day before. They were fine on my morning walk. There's no reason why they should stop working, so why? Okay, they're blinking - what's that mean? Okay, one headphone connected to phone and the other to my computer? What the fuck? I just wanted some music to do the damn dishes. Fucking things just keep blinking and bleeping at me and I keep hitting the buttons harder and harder because it's damn clear its not reading my finger inputs and - gods dammit my fucking phone froze; now how am I supposed to do the damn dishes in peace?! Why is that so much to ask?! Gods Dammit, today was going just fucking fine until-

Stop. Take a breath. Step away. Give yourself a moment. Yes the headphones are upsetting you, and also you accomplished a lot of housework and errands today and after these dishes you're home free for the evening. I know you want music to listen to - perhaps we just listen on the laptops speakers because that's working normally. How's that sound? You get the music, and you can figure out the phone and headphones later. Yeah? Alright, let's do that :)

TL;DR (past the dramatization): I was fully prepared to have a completely fine day utterly ruined in my mind because... my headphones wouldn't cooperate with my phone for what was ultimately a period of... fifteen minutes? And I could have. They either work or they don't; *they're* the problem, not me. Except the problem is how I'm Splitting (BPD Predominant feature: Things are either perfect or terrible. Good or Bad. White or Black. No middle ground.) the matter of my headphones not working. That event would have ruined everything if I let it, so after so much time practicing I've trained myself to *not* let that happen.

It's far from perfect, but I am still learning. And that statement is also in The Grey. I'm neither an expert or a failure at practicing mindfulness and distress techniques - I am somewhere in between perfection and failure, in The Grey."

"Sometimes people don't trust you enough to come back. Sometimes what you did might've hurt people or, in this case, the group. Other people, especially these days, have tendency to think people can't change or thinking that it's not worth the risk of seeing if someone has changed given that they've been toxic in the past. Hence we've got ghosting as a standard practice, but ostracizing people in cut and dry ways seems sub-optimal, which [this great article from The Atlantic talks about](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/03/psychology-of-silent-treatment-abuse/618411/).

Back to your situation: You shouldn't have to deal with their apprehension like this if you've offered a good apology, imo. Have they indicated whether you could come back and make amends before the group? If some people harbor resentment or distrust, it's hard to wash that away. It's not just people who have to work on these things as we do who let their emotions like anger and fear get in the way of change, but I digress.

**A wise mind way to approach it might be to just accept that the past things you did in emotion mind has caused these friends to approach you through the lens of their own emotion minds.** What does that possibly look like if you try to imagine you're one of these people feeling distrust, resentment, and fear towards you? What would you honestly do? It's hard but perspective taking can sometimes help you get to accepting that things are just broken. In the end, you have to do a lot of work to repair that kind of breach because the relationship is simply damaged now. You see it requires mental/emotional energy on both sides of a conflict to come together in peace let alone friendship

Moving forward towards new relationships having learned from this experience might be best. Since it's a group, maybe you can keep connected with the more forgiving people; they might communicate that you seem better able to handle yourself and put in a good word with you with the skeptical among the group. But watch out: this could lead you to the crutch of false hope. And once that false hope collapses, you might take a dangerous emotional hit. Read that again: at some level it's the same calculus for other people in terms of risk-reward and protecting oneself from emotional harm. Put yourself in their shoes assuming they're unsure about you.

I was an IRL friend, and he asked me to help him make more IRL friends. Problem was he didn't want to change literally anything with his behavior to make IRL friends. I learned because his online friends were not IRL that he lacked a great deal of social skills from lack of needing to use them. Some stuff came up, and I had to stop being his friend because the friendship was becoming toxic. I still miss him, and I felt that I had to stick to my own value system. To not invalidate my own values/boundaries.	roguepixel89	reply	na	na	na	0.7889865636825562	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"> Any advice for seeking new relationships?

Just what people typically say. Find people who share similar interests, hobbies and/or values. Participate in activities related to those shared interests etc. **EDIT:** Fully participate in activities with your whole body/mind; try to let go of insecurities and just focus on the activity/being present with other people. Do it online or do it offline; it does not matter, although each has particular advantages and disadvantages.

> This comment gives me less reassurance I can really make good relationships but I'm trying.

I'm really sorry it made you feel discouraged. Why do you feel like you can't really make good relationships? If you're trying, then that's all you can expect from yourself. You deserve companionship and belonging with people who like you for who you are. And if you don't succeed at fitting in or don't hit it off with one person/group, then there's always others. How many discord servers are there in the world? That's how many opportunities you have to try to find a new but similar place in which you might find belonging.

Also, I didn't mean to imply that mending relationships is a bad thing. I just mean that there's a point of diminishing returns if there's been too much drama or conflict. On the other hand, I almost always try to repair however badly it ends up or how much energy I expend. And sometimes that is worth it!

Both in the case of strained relationships and brand new ones you attempt to forge, half of the success or failure of forming a lasting connection is on the other person. If it doesn't work out, then it's not all your fault. Don't forget that.

As for your work schedule getting in the way... I don't have any good advice, but finding a new discord that's similar to the old one would seem logical."	roguepixel89	reply	na	na	na	0.7889865636825562	no	no	strong	na	dbtselfhelp

"Hi all,

I know that regarding my question it's best to consult a specialist - I am starting a therapy soon.

Before that I wanted to read a book that could help in my situation.

I am almost 35, but I still struggle with some of the things related to my childhood. Mainly how my family made me feel:

* I was the younger son so majority of the things I got after my borther. I hardly ever got anything new. He of course had new things.
* My grandparents and my aunts made fun of me that I was born on sunday and I am lazy because of that
* Also they always said that I start things and later quickly resign form them, but they never understood that I just love to learn about new things. The used this against me - ""What happened to XYZ? You used to love XYZ and now you don't like it? why?
* My parents divorced when I was 9 years old and both families pressured me and my brother with question ""Why did your dad decide to ...?"" or ""Why your mother did ...."".
* Hardly ever anyone asked me what I really would like to do/study etc and properly communicate my needs. My needs weren't a topic. I had to agree to what family decided.
* Generaly I felt that I am different than others and worse. That something is generally wrong with me.

I had some therapy when I was 25 years old and it helped me a lot, but now I feel that all the issues it started to pull me down.

What book helped you with similar things?"	Head-Technician-1313	post	35.10159098337167	female	White	0.9890432357788086	na	na	na	6	dbtselfhelp
"Hey,

So just a heads up that this is a subreddit for DBT, which is a very specific form of therapy, so this may not be the best place to find the answers you're looking for. We can guide you to resources that can teach you to start exploring DBT as a possible avenue for help (look at wiki for direct links), but this subreddit isn't exactly designed for help outside of DBT resources. 

That said, the book that comes up to me first is Soul Murder by Leonard Shengold, who was one of the great child psychologists of the mid-late 20th century. He writes a lot about neglect and how it shapes a child's identity, and you may find it informative. 

If you aren't in DBT, I do recommend checking out our resources and learning about the therapy; it was designed for individuals with mood disorders and have shown pretty good results for treating C-PTSD."	Head-Technician-1313	reply	na	na	na	0.9890432357788086	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

As well as pointing out the issues and effects of neglect, does it detail how to work against them; i.e. give tips on how to either not neglectfully parent or reverse the effect of prior mistakes?

"No, I don't believe any book about childhood trauma will give you parenting tips. Parenting is a completely different sub-field that usually incorporates several different fields of psychology, neuroscience, and biology all at once--you'll have to seek out parenting books for that. 

Shengold is a really old school clinical psychoanalyst so he's not interested in giving out concrete tips--that's not how psychoanalysis works. It's all about *personal* discovery: there's nothing you can tell people to get them to understand how to heal from trauma; rather, they need to gain the insight and realize/learn it themselves. That's why he keeps giving cases of different neglected children and breaking down what was happening psychologically; he wants you to draw the connections yourself. I personally think he's brilliant, but he's definitely not the type of write a pop culture bestseller because he's really asking people to do difficult work and people want quick and easy answers, which is the antithesis of psychoanalytic therapy.  

If you want a book that *does* give out tips, I think a book that's more focused on CBT would be useful, which does indeed believe you can simply tell people what to do to get better--stuff like recognizing cognitive distortions and eating/sleeping well. The flip side of treatments like CBT is that they're very universal--it doesn't matter if you have depression, or PTSD, or psychosis--all of it gets treated (roughly) the same way. You can see how this is the exact opposite of psychoanalysis, which is so intensely personal that Shengold pretty much doesn't write out anything explicit on what to do. CBT is sort of closer to what bestsellers like The Body Keeps Score by Van Der Kolk does, a book I personally think is really basic and overrated, but it's excellent if 1) you know nothing about trauma and you're just getting started and 2) it will be a good start to get concrete tips. It's not about childhood neglect, but because of the way CBT is universal, the idea is that if you learn about trauma in general, that's good enough--and to CBT's credit, I do think that this approach works for someone working out trauma for the first time. If you want something slightly more clinically complex, I much prefer Judith Herman's Trauma and Recovery. She mentions childhood abuse but it's not her main focus. Judith Herman is the first psychologist to coin the term, ""complex-PTSD"" and her book is brilliant for both beginners and clinicians, though I recommend going back to her ""recovery"" section *after* reading something basic like Van Der Kolk--it's aimed toward clinicians, so I find it easier to understand once you really understand how these people are thinking about trauma.

"Sometimes when I'm having overwhelming negative emotions I don't want to use my DBT skills to change them... because in the moment, I think that I deserve to feel that awful. Today I've noticed it happening to do with feelings of guilt (because ""if I did something bad I deserve to feel bad"").

Any ideas on how to deal with this?"	eli_eliza_bly	post	34.19062136522017	male	White	0.9974448680877686	na	na	na	4	dbtselfhelp
"I try to remember that the function of emotions like guilt are ultimately pro-social. Guilt motivates us to take a second to reflect on how our behavior impacts others. And ideally we would demonstrate our guilt in ways that signal to others that we feel sorry for our transgression. Guilt is a way to get us back into the group if we've done something (or failed to do something) that put the group in danger. 

So, if you've done that already - the self reflection, apologies, making amends - but still think you deserve to feel bad, that can lead to feeling justified in isolating and withdrawing from others. And then the guilt can stop being pro-social and it stops benefitting the group. If it feels bad to feel it, and it doesn't benefit anybody else, then maybe you feel it for another reason. 

Feeling guilty beyond what is warranted can also function as a way of avoiding feeling something else. I know for me, sometimes it would in some ways feel better if the unwarranted guilt was warranted because then it implies I have a bit more control over the situation than I actually have. 

I got most of these insights from the radically open dialectical behavior therapy workbook. And they've helped me so much. Hoping you find what will bring you relief."	eli_eliza_bly	reply	na	na	na	0.9974448680877686	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"I like your point that guilt is ultimately pro-social.  And I think your right that if the guilt does ""fit the facts"" - if we have done something against our values - then it's important to take action like apologies and making amends. That can lessen the feelings of guilt on its own. It did yesterday. But it wasn't worthwhile to withdraw any further than that, as my action wasn't all that terrible when I put it in perspective! 

After a while of crying and feeling guilty and not wanting to feel better, I eventually consulted my emotional regulation booklet, from when I did DBT group therapy. Then I tried to work out if the emotion was justified or not.

My guilt was somewhat but not totally justified. I did cancel on my friend less than an hour after we had planned to meet up, and being ""reliable"" is one of my values. But the intensity of my guilt was not justified! I did end up taking the actions of apologising, seeking repair (offered to pay her back if she had already bought me a movie ticket). In terms of preventing this happening again, I want to find some way of getting better at time management and emotional regulation (the two things that I didn't do well at that caused me to cancel.) Haven't made specific plans for that yet.

I have a friend who asked me to help her learn more about DBT. I've referenced DBT throughout different conversations for multiple months. I would explain, and break down, DBT concepts and specific skills when she would ask. The waiting list is usually multiple months long. She asked me if I could basically tutor her in DBT while she's on the waiting list, or in case something comes up and she can't attend group DBT. I told her yes! I love to help others learn DBT or other topics. It's a bonus it's DBT related. Plus, they say one of the best ways to learn is to teach other people. I'm planning on going really slow since DBT can be really overwhelming, and I believe best taught over a larger span of time. Like they do with group DBT, and in this case most likely much slower. She has some of her own disorders, which I won't get into. Anyone I think can benefit from learning even if only partly, DBT skills. It really has helped in my life. So far, about four different people have asked me to explain DBT. Two of which wanted to know how to join the waiting list.

"Do you own the official DBT manual by linehan? For how much I recommend it specifically I probably sound like a paid shill, but I promise I am not. But it is the original and core teaching text of the methodology. I think it would help if both of you had the exact same copy (it is $40-50 and comes spiral bound but I see it as low as $19 (on a site called book vault not sure it’s reputable tho) and $28 used on Amazon, same on abebooks with free shipping (possibly the same seller I think abebooks was bought by Amazon really not sure)

But ANYWAY—however you get it, I think everyone who considers DBT greatly benefits from having the original text to learn as it was intended.

Once you both have it, it provided a wonderful place for both of you to start along with fillable worksheets to help guide your discussions.

I honestly think this is OK as long as you're not developing a therapy dynamic with them--e.g. not doing anything like assigning them homework and positioning yourself as the person who is giving answers to their problems. My friends and I share tips and recent therapy developments with one another all the time--e.g. our experiences in experimental therapy like psychedelics and ketamine, or DBT, or EMDR, etc. etc. We all have different experiences and different spheres of knowledge we can pass on but none of us are acting like an authority, and we all know not to treat each other like one, so we're fine.

"Hi,

I've noticed my DBT therapist is not very good at keeping track of the work from one session to another. After the last session, I was really upset about this. Here is what happened:  


1. I had a session two weeks ago and based on her suggestion we agreed I will keep track of my judgments. For example where I judge people etc. I followed through with this and wrote in my diary cards judgemental thoughts. For example, ""A person was wearing a horrible trashy t-shirt"".
2. She canceled last week's session which is why it has been two weeks since our last session.
3. I had a session this Monday and at the start of the session as she reads my cards and goes over the judgments I wrote in the cards she is saying ""Sounds like you need to work on non-judgment"". I told her I wrote them because she asked me to last session. She just said she forgot and then we did not do anything about those notes.

This is a common thing with her and I feel frustrated. I wrote this therapy-interfering behavior in my cards and I that we need to address it by keeping track of action items in a shared Google doc. I wrote that this is a deal breaker for me because I feel disrespected and like she is wasting my time by asking me to do something and then not following through.

"Radical acceptance doesn’t been being okay will all sorts of shit.

Radical acceptance as a skill is meant to help you deal with things _you cannot change_. 

That doesn’t mean sitting back and singing kumbaya when things are not okay. It means accepting what you cannot change so you can focus your energy on what you _can_ change. It means not spending your time wishing things were different but working with how things actually are. 

I don’t know what types of things you’re referencing in your post but to answer your question:

I draw the line precisely at “is this something in my control”? If it’s not in my control, if I cannot change anything about it, I radically accept. Then I look for what is in my control about the situation and get to work on that."	Sad-Outside222	reply	na	na	na	0.9738025665283203	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I feel like it's natural to care about SOME things but radical acceptance is more about practicing and getting to the point where you don't sweat the small stuff. The best exercise that helped me get the concept was trying to read news headlines without passing judgment or forming opinions. 

Similarly my previous approach to dealing with people's behavior was coming up with a sad backstory, over rationalizing, explaining excuse for why they were like that. It drained me so much and even though I was nice, there comes a limit.

"Is it logical to take it personally and let it upset you when others aren't acting logically, especially when you know for a fact that not everyone is going to act logically all the time?


Do you find yourself wanting to care less (or not at all) about what other people do, but you just can't do it, even though it's logical?


The answer's always the same: it's wiser to let go


Another angle: What are you gaining by being judgmental? Being emotionally upset/judgemental more often...and...well that's about it, I suppose.


Holding onto anger is like grasping a hot coal, thinking it will burn your enemy. It's only you that gets hurt.


There are only so many seconds in a day, and in your life. How many do you need to spend judging others, and being upset by their actions, before it dawns on you that those seconds could have been spent happier, if you'd just gone the logical route and not cared what they did?


We're all human. No one's perfect. No one would be in this sub if they were perfect. You wouldn't have made this post, or had this problem, if you were perfect. I think that's important to remember. Odds are, if you're overly judgy of others, you're also too hard on yourself. I think you have to let go of spending too much time/emotional energy on judging others at the same time you let go of judging yourself.


You really can just tell yourself ""We're all human. They're not perfect. I'm not perfect. It's wise to choose to let go of wishing they'd/I'd been more perfect. It's wise to find peace within."	Sad-Outside222	reply	na	na	na	0.9738025665283203	no	no	strong	na	dbtselfhelp
"Radical acceptance doesn’t mean you’re ok with whatever is happening. It means you’re taking “should” out of the picture. 

For instance, we often get stuck on “This shouldn’t be happening” or “this is not how this was supposed to happen” and it wrecks our brains because reality is not conforming to what we stubbornly insist it should be. 

Radical acceptance allows us to instead say “This is what’s happening right now, and I need to figure out what I need to do to handle it.”

That can mean talking to someone about their feelings without being judgmental. It can mean owning up to a mistake and accepting feedback on what you can do better in the future. It can be that your partner is being abusive and you need to leave both the situation and them. 

Not “they shouldn’t feel that way” or “why am I always getting criticized” or “they shouldn’t be treating me like this, why can’t they see that?”. Those are all non-reality statements and beliefs. Radical acceptance allows you to deal with reality as it is instead of trying to force it into what you think it should be.

">When Do You Draw the Line Between Nonjudgmental/Radical Acceptance and “Okay, This is Actually Ridiculous”?

Two things.

First of all, in the DBT sense, radical acceptance is a *distress tolerance* skill, just like TIPP or STOP, not a problem solving skill or way of life. Distress tolerance skills are strategies to get though difficult feelings and situations without making matters worse. Just as TIPP isn't designed as to be a method for *processing* your emotions (i.e. it's not expected that you will always douse your face with cold water when feeling strong emotion), radical acceptance isn't processing your emotions either, it's just reframing to avoid spiralling.


 Second, my DBT clinic combined DBT with ACT, and acceptance in ACT refers to private experiences, not things in the world. You have no more control over automatic thoughts and emotions Pavlov's dog has over salivating when the bell rings, so we accept all private experiences as the truth of the moment, i.e. ""I'm having the thought that..."" or ""I feel..."". Things in the world can be acted upon, so while you accept the truth of the moment, you can also act to change things in the world."

"Non-judgemental is a mindfulness ""how"" skill. It is about how we observe and describe the world around us and our own feelings, thoughts and sensations. When we practise being non-judgemental, we try to let go of describing things as good or bad (both are judgements), and instead try to just describe something how it is. It doesn't mean that everything is fine and we have to just ignore things that we don't like.

Your feelings are your feelings - *that's* what you accept radically and fully. Can you have these emotions while responding to daily stressors? Can this acceptance make it possible for you to effectively act to change the stressors? Accepting that you are angry, or afraid, or sad, or ashamed is simply accepting the truth of the moment. Denying these feelings or trying to ""discharge"" them in a fit doesn't change what you feel, it just makes the feelings more difficult and tangley. 

If a relationship at work is a stressor, should you simply accept the stressor?

"Here's a Zen story that always reminds me that I don't have to carry difficult emotions or experiences. I hope it speaks to you.



A senior monk and a junior monk were traveling together. At one point, they came to a river with a strong current. As the monks were preparing to cross the river, they saw a very young and beautiful woman also attempting to cross. The young woman asked if they could help her cross to the other side.

The two monks glanced at one another because they had taken vows not to touch a woman.

Then, without a word, the older monk picked up the woman, carried her across the river, placed her gently on the other side, and carried on his journey.

The younger monk couldn’t believe what had just happened. After rejoining his companion, he was speechless, and an hour passed without a word between them.

Two more hours passed, then three, finally the younger monk could contain himself no longer, and blurted out “As monks, we are not permitted to touch a woman, how could you then carry that woman on your shoulders?”

The older monk looked at him and replied, “Brother, I set her down on the other side of the river, why are you still carrying her?”"	nttogt	reply	na	na	na	0.9970888495445251	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

You're only supposed to use them in a crisis (i.e. your emotions are in a ""red zone,"" the situation can't get better, but it CAN get worse. If the situation is not meeting these conditions, it's not a crisis and you should use other skills), and the skills are there to make sure you don't harm yourself or others. If you get out of a crisis situation without harming yourself and others, distress tolerance has succeeded. Note that distress tolerance isn't necessarily even supposed to make you feel better--just not worse. It's literally just there to stop you from self sabotage.

"My program taught me to use SUDs (subjective units of distress) to decide on which skill family to leverage. Your SUDs are your current intensity of distress from 1-10, where 1 is zen and 10 is the most distressed you've ever been in your life. The trick is being really honest about the numbers. I actually wrote out in a notebook what each number feels like for me so I can look at a reference in the moment rather than try to brain about it.

Once you know your SUDs, you use the following ranking to pick a skill set: 1-3 interpersonal effectiveness, 4-6 emotion regulation, 7-10 distress tolerance. And the thing that they taught us is that you *cannot* access the skills of a lower distress level when you're in a higher bracket. And the idea of DBT is to step you down until you're in the 1-3 zone by using skills. So DT is *only* for when you're above a 7. If you use it when you're lower than that, it loses effectiveness. Once you drop below 7, then you move to ER.

Another thing my program talked about is the natural rhythm of emotions. If you don't ""hang on"" to a feeling, it naturally will peak and pass within 20 minutes. DT is to help you survive that peak and stop ""holding on"" to the feelings so your distress can naturally drop. Once it's dropped, then you can access ER and prevent yourself from climbing up in distress again. DT is only ever a stopgap to get you through the worst of it until you can use more sophisticated skills. Over a longer time, repeated practice of IE and ER skills will reduce the frequency of hitting 7+ SUDs and therefore need for DT."	ultramagnus_tcv	reply	na	na	na	0.9978311657905579	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"It depends on what you mean by overwhelmed--was it panic attack/can't think at all/going to do negative behaviors type of overwhelmed? In that case you're supposed to do distress tolerance over and over again, because the point is to do anything but bad behaviors. If you're not self-destructing, you are succeeding with distress tolerance. 

Once you're not in danger of destructive behavior/*do* have the ability to think, though, you're supposed to switch to emotion regulation. Emotions can be strong and NOT require distress tolerance because if you can think enough to check the facts and do a STUN wave, you can think enough to exercise emotional regulation. 

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions :)

Edit: to answer your question directly, if you want to get to the heavy work of solving your problems, yes, you should start working on emotional regulation immediately post plank.

"Honestly that sounds fairly similar to how I was doing when I started my DBT program. So I don't think you're seeing something really unusual, though whether that makes it better or worse I don't know lmao But it sounds like you've got some behavior chains going on that you're starting to understand, so the way I'd think about it is I use DBT to get through the wave of emotion for 20 mins and then I'd work on behavior chain and other ER skills as much as I could until my SIDs popped up, then back to DT, etc. It can be a frustrating feeling cycle.

Something else that I don't think we talk about enough in the context of DBT is that it can be supplemented really well with ERP (exposure and response prevention). My PHP actually had one or two days a week where we did exposures, and it was really helpful for me. So basically the concept is, you face The Thing in the tiniest most baby step you can possibly imagine, get distressed about it, see that it doesn't kill you, and have that 20 min wave of emotion come down before you do self-soothing behavior. Basically, you're taking the tiniest possible doses until you can cope, and then you up the dose. I mention this bc it sounds like you're getting exposed to a really distressing thing on the regular. And the thing about exposures is that it HAS to be precisely the right amount of exposure. Too much exposure off the bat and you reinforce the fear response. So all of this rambling to say, is there a way you can take a more baby steps approach to the Thing that's causing you distress? You could do imaginal practice (ie, run through the scenario in your head and use your skills in your imagination-- similar to a cope head), or you could break it down into smaller parts if that's possible. Then, you have a smaller exposure, your distress doesn't climb as high, and you can use ER skills more consistently.

"Hi,

I found a document online that explains SUDs and gives me a scale. It's a 0-10 scale, but it's easy to translate to a scale that is 0-1.

8 is defined as:
High levels of fear, anxiety, sadness, anger, agitation, and/or body tension. These feelings cannot be tolerated for long. Bodily distress is substantial. It is difficult to focus on anything.

9 is defined as:
Ready to explode! You can't think very clearly. At risk to make very bad choices.

I would say I've been whiplashing between those two since Tuesdayn evening. Sometimes--when I'm in 9--I am crying almost uncontrollably. Heavy sobs and difficulty breathing. 

Unfortunately, there isn't any one thing that's causing distress. It's many things, including some things I'm sure I can't put into words. One of the biggest problems right now is loneliness. Some of that is self-imposed--I'm feeling avoidant--but some is simply circumstance and I can't do anything about it. I'm not sure how to incorporate ERP into this.

I'm not sure if you have any urges or if it's just a sob (as someone who's also a big crier...I honestly think it's better just to sob it out; we're not hurting anyone). I'd use distress tolerance until you calm down (if you feel like it; personally I'm ok being a self-proclaimed crybaby and sobbing it out). But you'll probably keep sobbing to the point of hyperventilating unless you switch to emotion regulation once you feel better.

"I have a friendship that’s very fulfilling but I knew it was sounding boundary alarms, stuff I learned in a DBT course a long time ago. 

So yeah that’s … well, it’s okay but it can’t remain at that level and the proper boundaries are being setup now. 

As someone who is close enough to BPD and loves a good binary, sometimes it feels like DBT says, “you shouldn’t need anyone.” And so I don’t know when it’s inappropriate to reach out to friends. 

The idea of DBT as my only friend doesn’t sound good."	ultramagnus_tcv	post	27.300935295981215	male	White	0.007751449942588806	na	na	na	6	dbtselfhelp
"So, welcome to the most integral and hardest to grasp part of DBT: Radical Acceptance.

If you're like me, then your mind is deeply fond of black and white thinking IE binaries. Either or. Never And.

The reason it's hard is it's simple. There's always an And.

Dialecticals are thought frames where in two opposing views are both held to be valid - shades of grey, not black and white.

Now that we have the terms laid out, let's address your concerns. Yes, it's possible that that relationship may be bordering into co dependence. But that's not hard and fast. And even though no one should ever really say these words: it's okay for a relationship to be a little codependent. What matters is the positive and negative impact on those participating in the relationship. Does holding this relationship impact your ability to lead a fulfilling life? Cause it doesn't sound like it.

Boundaries do not mean solid walls through and through. Think of the layers surrounding you as a person. Your skin, the air, your clothes, the room and the door to it you're in, your house, your neighborhood hood, your town, your state/country. All of those are boundaries at once, though all provide different layers of interaction. And so we return to the dialectic: not too much, not too little. Goldilocks zone - just right.

For myself it was helpful to pull back from certain friends for a while while I worked on my boundaries and sense of self. But that's just me. All methods work, even if they don't work for all people. And that is okay.

The goal is not With people or Without people, but what sort of level you are comfortable existing in. Somewhere in the middle."	ultramagnus_tcv	reply	na	na	na	0.007751449942588806	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Not at all. A big part of DBT is building a support network. Having boundaries doesn’t mean you don’t need anyone, it’s key to long-term healthy relationships. And if placing boundaries means that some relationships in you life end, they were never that healthy to begin with. 

In my experience, most people with BPD are either super codependent with people or hyper independent. Both are styles of relationships that have issues. The goal is to find a healthy medium."	ultramagnus_tcv	reply	na	na	na	0.007751449942588806	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Of course not! It just says that your life is about YOU and not others.  It does encourage healthy relationships, and the ability to meet a lot of needs in ourselves that we've typically tried to meet through others (usually unsucessfully). It means not being helplessly dependent on someone else, and as you get better, you're more able to tolerate being on your own, but relationships are a part of the human experience that we all need. 
DBT just recognizes others as a part of our lives, rather than the focus."	ultramagnus_tcv	reply	na	na	na	0.007751449942588806	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"I am BPD-adjacent if not Quiet. I also suffer from C-PTSD. I attempt to enmesh myself with some people and, if they are receptive, we become even closer and it threatens to get out of control. I have been on the other side of ""out of control"" and, at that time, I was steadily marching to un-alive. The pain was incredible.

I went through an IOP program in 2018/19 and had enough lasting experience from that to hear and feel alarms while in this particular relationship. (I learned DBT in that program, but we were not taught application. It seems silly now, but it's true. On Monday, I start with a new therapist and we will be laser-focused on re-familiarizing  and skills application.)

I am desperately lonely sometimes and am not always heard properly. (There is a context I should offer here for this situation, but it's a long story. Suffice it to say that feeling ""desperately lonely"" has been a companion for a number of weeks.) When the other person in this dynamic really does hear me, really does get me, I'm like a moth to a porch light.

That's what happened here. I ignored the warnings because we simply communicated so well. I felt so seen and heard, unlike anything I've ever experienced. They said the same. I think our shared trauma and diagnoses were a big factor.

But the communication frequency increased so much we were both starting to ignore basic needs. In their case, they struggle with writing. It can take them nearly 30 minutes to write two or three paragraphs. I am much quicker, but I, first, hung on to our DMs looking for indications they were replying and, second, replied immediately when I received one. This encouraged them to continue to reply and their entire day and evening started to get consumed by our conversations. 

Because we were both so seen/heard, we kept going. They realized things were starting to spiral from BPD issues and requested boundaries. They broke the fever. I admitted—reluctantly of course—that they were right. We started to setup boundaries... aaaand I started to feel like I was losing a friend entirely. (Binary thinking.)

I started to reach out to other friends to talk about this and I started to wonder if it wasn't skillful. I then slipped back into black-and-white thinking and felt that DBT was saying that I shouldn't need friends. All I need is a workbook.

That's what motivated this question. I also asked on a Facebook skills group I participate in. Everyone said much the same as you.

As for what's going to happen in this friendship, we both want it to continue. We both feel that we have a lot in common and that it's worth keeping our friendship. (""Closer than most,"" a quote from M\*A\*S\*H.) But we're both now committed to keeping things in control. We've instituted a system whereby we clearly acknowledge what needs a reply and not. Most things don't. For my part, I keep my responses relatively short and I notice they are too. 

I think it's going to take an immense amount of watching, as if we're both sentries, to make sure things remain proper for both of us. I am grateful to them for putting on the brakes. I am in pain, sometimes searing pain when I think about it, but it feels necessary, a bitter pill that helps manage the disease."	ultramagnus_tcv	follow-up	na	na	na	0.007751449942588806	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"I do this thing when I’m mad at someone where I think of all the most hurtful things they’ve done to me and imagine myself telling them about it in cruel and heartless ways. I imagine myself really hurting their feelings. This takes me to a point of considering saying these things to them in real life. Obviously, if I were to act out my scenarios in real life, it would be toxic and abusive. The thing is, in the moment it feels so good to think these out. It really satiates the toxic and unhealthy parts of my brain when I imagine hurting people. 

But I don’t want to be like this. How can I stop myself from acting on these thoughts? What DBT skills can be helpful in helping me to prevent acting on my thoughts and to even deter my way of thinking in general? 

If it helps, I know a lot of this thinking stems from me not being listened to when I was upset and mad as a kid. In turn, when I feel like I’m in situations where my feelings are not being considered, I become angry like this. Also as a note, just communicating with the person I’m upset with isn’t always an option."	feelingsleepy27	post	20.973445903895154	female	White	0.005398436915129423	na	na	na	9	dbtselfhelp
"I do this a lot myself and it ain't great! I'll even find myself feeling really angry seemingly out of nowhere because I'm acting out hypothetical conversations in my head. How I keep myself from acting on the urges that come with it includes a few different skills and some cognitive reframing. 

First, when I feel myself getting worked up, I use the STOP skill. After that, I'll usually check the facts and if the emotions fit the facts (ie I feel angry because someone treated me unfairly), I'll ask my wise mind if this might be something worth addressing with them at some point (using interpersonal effectiveness skills, of course!). If the emotions don't fit the facts, then I use opposite action. If all else fails, gentle avoidance and distraction until I feel regulated again. 

I also try hard to notice if I'm slipping into black-or-white thinking, especially if it's in relation to another person. If I am, I try find the grey area by reminding myself of the positives, etc. I also play the tape forward and consider the consequences. Like, if I actually say these awful things to this person, there could be a very real chance I'll seriously damage the relationship and that would cause me a whole slew of other big, negative emotions."	feelingsleepy27	reply	na	na	na	0.005398436915129423	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Thank you for putting this into words so eloquently! I experience something similar, so it was validating just reading this from another person's perspective. When I feel out of control of my mind, like this is describing, mindfulness skills are the answer. Allow yourself to purely Observe and then Describe the thoughts. And remember to do so without judgment (Nonjudgmentally)! You are not your thoughts, you are the observer of the thoughts. Notice them, describe them briefly and factually (""I'm noticing thoughts of harming So-and-So"" or ""I'm noticing feelings of anger and the desire to harm So-and-So coming up."")

"I am still struggling with this so hard. There is nothing wrong with us for this, but you’ve recognized it’s not helpful. It creates more vengeful feelings for us and drags out the suffering these people have caused. It’s even more difficult when it would be highly inappropriate to seek the person out to deliver the message, in-person, over email, snail mail, etc. In my specific situation, this is what has helped:

- Teflon mind (TFM): Continually acknowledging the thought and letting it slip away from your consciousness. Do not hold on or indulge these thoughts.
- One-mindfully (OM): Engage in a mindfulness activity when you feel the thoughts bubbling up again. I close my eyes and start by focusing on my breath with square breathing. Then I do a body scan and ensure I relax anything that’s tensed or clenched. Then I play a game that consumes my attention, like the last/first letter game (e.g., carrot, turnip, pancake, egg, guac, cantaloupe, etc.). You can pick any category (musical artists, car make/model, things found in nature, etc.)
- Write down what you feel you need to say once and for all and read it to your therapist. Then physically burn the piece of paper. (I still need to do this.)
- This one is the hardest for me and does not apply to some traumas, but it helps for major fall-outs/misunderstandings, day-to-day inconveniences, etc. It involves admitting it’s possible that the person who hurt us may have been doing the best they could with their limited resources — emotional, psychological, monetary, physical or intellectual. I like to believe that most of the time, people are not doing hurtful things to be malicious. They are doing so because they are ignorant, emotionally exhausted, threatened, insecure or desperate for something. Even if it’s not true, it helps me to believe everyone is doing the best they can. To me, this somewhat aligns with non-judgmental stance (NJS), and it absolutely does not work in all situations.

For me anyway, I often find there is some novelty around these thoughts, it’s something that feels tempting to act on and is fun to imagine. It is more emotional mind for me to keep thinking about it, or to act on it, however it doesn’t align with my values. If I try to stop thinking about it altogether then it never loses that novelty, it feels unfinished, and it feels like something I want to rebel against. How I like to deal with this is by telling myself that if I really wanted to then I could do that. I could go through with the urge, and it doesn’t help me get closer to any goals and it’s not who I am. I could but when I think about it I don’t want to. It stops being novel and I’m not acting on the urge. :)	feelingsleepy27	reply	na	na	na	0.005398436915129423	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I think it's less about completely stopping the thoughts, and more about acknowledging and practicing letting those thoughts go. Letting them go through different Mindfulness techniques, and routine practice of Mindfulness techniques. That way it is easier to do the techniques and/or skills when you need them more than usual. To help lower emotional intensity is good with hurtful scenarios. Both in the present real world, as well as your mind

I am in no way perfect, and no one is completely perfect

"I used to struggle a lot with this especially in romantic relationships, but not only. I'd relive everything that hurt me, cry and imagine how I will get back to that person. It was hurtful but also rewarding on some strange level.   
What helped me was mindfulness + distracting. Being aware that I am doing it, and try to really focus my brain power on something else. It was honestly so hard! 

A silly thing that I did was force myself to do one duolingo lesson (a free app to learn a foreign language) as soon as I became aware of the thought. I think that worked on multiple levels: 

*    engages the mind enough to not have space to think of something else
*    has bright colors and sounds that are also distracting and elicit other emotions
*    gives you a small sense of accomplishment   


At first, I was motivating myself by doing it out of spite. I was so mad and I was thinking maybe my ""revenge"" is that this person is not even worth me thinking about them, but after a while it became habit and now honestly, years later I cannot even do that behaviour.

"My life has improved a lot from dbt, and while it is not fixed and I am still dealing with my bpd I am able to handle most everything normal life has to throw at me.

It's been about ten years since I started dbt. I am interested in looking at schism and attachment styles to try and continue to improve but I wouldn't be where I am today (steady job for  6 years that is stressful but rewarding and a relationship that we are both working on improving ourselves and our relationship) without dbt.

It helped me see when my son was struggling with his emotions as a teen and along with being able to share my skills it made sure I was fully aware when it should be a therapist thing and not a mom thing.

Despite 3 years of an almost non-functional parent while I found meds/therapy/dbt, my son is fairly well-adjusted, sweet, smart and just a good person.

I have helped a coworker by recommending skills and where to find the knowledge, with that she got through a really dark time in her life. I didn't know it at the time, but she came and thanked me for the help like a year or so later.

"Not sure where you're pulling your studies from, but there's decent evidence that it works in the long term. [Linehan's original 1991 study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/495579) was already following subjects over 1 year, for example. The other major studies of DBT in English (the other DBT hub is Germany, but unfortunately I don't read German so I can't pull their data) are [Scheel 2006](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1093%2Fclipsy.7.1.68), which is a meta-analysis that covers data followed for 19 months and 2 years (among other, shorter term studies), and [Kroger et al 2010](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-24305-006), another meta-analysis with a mean duration of 40 weeks.  All three studies show at least moderate efficacy with DBT. 

[This study](https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/epdf/10.1521/pedi_2018_32_394) is the most comprehensive longitudinal study I could find, and followed 58 patients over 12-18 years. 81% of the patients no longer met the criteria for BPD, even after 12+ years (though QOL is a different matter). For adolescents, there is [the Marceau et al 2021](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-021-03372-2), which I've seen very commonly cited, but this also follows children for 10 years and found efficacy in DBT. 

I will admit that I think there should be even more robust studies done, and critically, the data shows that chances of recurrence skyrocket unless you stick with DBT for at least 6 months (Scheel 2006 for more info). Studies that are shorter than 6 months, then, are likely already ""invalid"" in that it's not following the established protocol for efficacy. DBT is also relatively new, and there are only so many people with BPD who conveniently live near a major university hospital that has the resources to study them over the long term. But the initial data is pretty promising, and I can personally say that I've spoken to many clinicians who say their clinical experience backs these studies up. 

TL;DR: DBT is not a ruse. There is strong clinical data to back up everyone's anecdotes here."		reply	na	na	na	0.9992621541023254	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

Personally, I’ve had good long term benefits. I started DBT in 2018 (so, like 5 years ago now I guess lol) and I’m doing well today. I started in a partial hospital program, then did DBT group therapy 1x/week and DBT individual therapy 1x/week for a year, then continued on with individual DBT therapy 1x/week since then (so like for 4 years I guess?). I also did DBT-PE, which is a trauma treatment, in 2019 (and have come back to that treatment / added on several times since then). If you have ptsd, cptsd, or trauma, I definitely recommend addressing the trauma at some point. I think DBT helped me be *able* to address it, if that makes sense. Working to not avoid stuff (opposite action) was the key thing that improved my ptsd.

I’m now doing individual DBT therapy every other week. In these years, I’ve also had other bad stuff happen: family deaths, I’ve developed chronic illnesses, covid happened, etc, which all worsened and complicated the issues I originally came into therapy with. 

I’ve also done a lot of self discovery in the past couple of years and discovered that I’m autistic (and possibly adhd). I think that many DBT patients are neurodivergent, and this isn’t really acknowledged by DBT therapists or the DBT curriculum itself. I recommend looking into these things yourself if you notice some autistic or adhd traits in yourself. Autism/adhd and ptsd seem to be the underlying issues that landed me in DBT in the first place. The ptsd is much better now, as I said. My DBT therapist doesn’t know much about autism, so I’m using other resources to help myself with that.

Personally, I struggled for years starting in my early teens. I tried countless medications, TMS therapy, and was in regular therapy the entire time. Nothing seemed to help at all until I tried DBT. I had refused it for years out of similar concerns and I sometimes wonder how different things would have been if I had started earlier. This won’t be the same for everyone, but for me, I did a year long course and it turned everything around. It’s been 7 years since then, and I consider myself to be a fairly happy, perfectly competent adult, which is something I did not think was possible back then. I still use the skills today. I really threw myself into it, which is important for success. I also had a good connection with my counselor and group. The sessions are for learning the skills and asking questions and the rest of the week is for practicing the skills in your daily life.

I’ve been doing DBT for 3 years. It has radically changed my life and the way I show up for myself and others, as well as how I move in the world. I am living a life beyond my wildest dreams, and that was the gift DBT gave me. I have seen more personal growth that seems to continue as long as I remain willing to do the work. It’s helped me end toxic relational patterns and leave behind toxic people. It’s helped me gain self confidence and assertiveness in communicating my wants/needs/boundaries. It’s given me a sense of safety for the first time in my life. It’s made all my relationships with others, and most importantly my relationship with myself flourish. My son is now in DBT. My mom is now in therapy. I just curated an art show for the first time in my life with no formal training. I’m opening a nonprofit for trauma recovery. I have a deep connection with spirituality thanks to mindfulness and meditation. There is nothing in my life that hasn’t changed for the better as a result of using it to the best of my ability every day (which looks different depending on the day). I’m waking up grateful instead of upset that I woke up at all. I’m no longer dealing with severe insecurities. Thanks to DBT PE the traumas don’t even really hold any sway over me anymore.

Basically, I have a friend who has made me feel unsafe in the past (likely accidentally) and when I have tried to set boundaries with them it hasn’t always been clear, and seemed to go over their head or be dismissed. They also have a tendency to engage in risky behavior that I can’t watch or be a part of without causing myself harm. 

They want to hang out again, and I’m not interested in putting myself through unnecessary distress again. 

I don’t know which interpersonal effectiveness skill would be most helpful, seeing as the issues happened months ago and there are multiple layers. I’m guessing a mix of Dear Man and Fast, but there’s a lot of focus on talking only about the present moment, and not bringing up the past. I’m not sure how I can handle this without doing so.  

Note: this conversation will likely be happening over direct messages, as I am still not able to be firm when talking face to face or over the phone."	sky-amethyst23	post	36.48423474630708	female	White	0.9767591953277588	na	na	na	2	dbtselfhelp
"Hi, so it may be helpful to use the skill ""clarifying priorities"" from interpersonal effectiveness. It asks you to consider

1. the objective you are trying the obtain (what specific results you want from the interaction? What do you want the other person to do, accept or stop?),
2. the relationship (how do you want the other person to feel about you after the interaction, based on \*how\* you handle the interaction, regardless of whether you get what you want),
3. and your self respect (how do you want to feel about yourself after the interaction, based on how you handle the interaction, regardless of whether or not you get what you want)

Then rank them from most to least important.Then note any imbalances and conflicts in these priorities that make it hard to be effective.

When you have done this, you now have more of an idea of \*how\* you want your DEAR MAN to come across. Do a DEAR MAN regardless, but tailor it to suit your priorities. So if your priority is the relationship, you would use the GIVE skill to make your DEAR MAN more validating, gentle, easy manner etc. If your main priority is your self respect, you would use the FAST skill to make your DEAR MAN fair to yourself and them, confident, truthful, and sticking to your values. If your priority is the objective, then you can maybe focus on the MAN in DEAR MAN- so, how you can stick to the topic, stay mindul, ignore attacks or negotiate to try and get what you want.

"No matter what age, I've always run into the same issue when trying to move forward with my life.

I'm qualified for most of the things I do or try to do. Even if I'm not, I'm not ashamed of doing my best and failing so it shouldn't even matter.

Yet, whether if it's a petty school test or a big job... A mundane task or something important that needs to be done... I'm always left shaking right before. A voice in my head whispering premonitions of imminent catastrophe. 'You're going to fail, you're going to fail! You can't do this! Give up and go kill yourself! They'll never accept you! You'll never succeed! If you try, your life will be awful! Give up give up give up!'

It's not just even the voice. My stomach feels like it's going to flip over, my heart feels light and I feel dizzy. Like how you feel if you're scared of heights and you're looking down 19 floors. Is it anxiety? Self-hatred? Whatever it is, it leaves me more stressed than the task itself ever could!

I don't know how to stop it. I can't calm down, it's always so bad. The only thing that's ever helped is self-harm because the pain is distracting, but sometimes that doesn't work either.

I should be going back to my therapist to address this but I can't even make the call because I'm so stressed about it too! What kind of dumb brain do I have that it thinks it can tell me I'm going to fail a phone call?!

But I'm still trying. I managed to make this post, finally. Would love to hear your thoughts on it, any advice or if you have been through the same. Thank you for your time."	KanawanuOmoi	post	14.34246853825314	female	White	0.9968177080154419	na	na	na	1	dbtselfhelp
"First of all, I think it's great that you managed to describe your emotions so succinctly. You used all the skills of Describing Your Emotions: naming senses (stomach flipping over, dizziness, etc), thoughts (you're going to fail, etc) and urges (avoidance, self harm). You even suggest some causes: fear (anxiety) and self hatred. It seems like you've got the problem down pat! 

The only task now is for you to address these emotions in an effective manner. The first question is, ""Is this emotion justified?"" It's clear that in this case, it's not, so your solution is Opposite Action to fear and self-hatred. From personal experience, I suspect that the self-hatred is underlying the fear, so I would work on self-compassion first. 

Part of self-compassion is being able to frame your life in wins instead of failures. This is ENORMOUSLY hard for me to the point of damn near impossibility so it'll probably be a struggle at first. But by framing your losses by what you achieved, you train yourself to believe that in fact, you're *not* a failure. 

Unfortunately opposite action amounts to ""just do it"" on a fundamental level, which I understand is an incredibly difficult response to fear. Is there some way you can get support as you do tasks? One thing I did with my friends was texting 1 whenever I'm in a bad place. I don't have the energy to write out the long paragraphs that amount to, ""I'm in a really bad place right now. I need to cancel our plans. Please can you help me?"" so instead I just text a number to them. It lets them know not to expect anything from me and that they should call me if and when they have the time for me. That creates an automatic system of support where people voluntarily come to me to help when I'm not in a place to ask for it. Could you set up something similar with your support network (therapist, friends, family), perhaps? 

Hope this helps! Best of luck; the fear of failure is definitely one of my most crippling demons so I wish you all the luck."	KanawanuOmoi	reply	na	na	na	0.9968177080154419	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"im pasting this over from r/mentalhealth because i was told you all may have the best resources for my situation. im happy to answer any questions if needed/requested

hi all, so the past few years of my life i have watched my physical and mental health decline and i don't really know what to do. i have diagnosed major depression, anxiety (social/gad), and cptsd. my doctor started me on adhd medication this past month while we wait for somewhere to be available to test me for both adhd and also bpd. i know there is overlap between cptsd and bpd, but i am worried i have both. i have been trying to find someone to test me for over a year now, and i just want the peace of mind that will come with just knowing whether or not i have these disorders. and even if i don't have adhd or bpd, i still wake up every day wishing i had someone to talk through my problems with that understands and could help guide me towards a better path. i have read countless articles online, and done as much research as i can understand, but still my life has gone completely off the rails and i feel helpless trying to get it back on track. all of the therapists in my area seem to either not take my insurance (which is problematic because i have essentially no money due to long periods of unemployment so i cannot pay out of pocket), or they will not be interested/qualified in treating people with my disorder(s). im close to the point where i will have given up, and while i don't want to get to that point i lack any energy or intrinsic motivation. this is somewhere between a rant and a cry for help, but mentally i am leaning towards the latter. thank you in advance for any help."

"First of all, I'm sorry you've gone through so much in the past few years. I applaud you for reaching out for help, and I hope you can find peace soon. 

Second, there are a few points to untangle here. The first is, are you currently in a DBT program, or are you asking if you think DBT could help? You can look at our wiki for more info, but DBT is not like CBT in that it gives you a bunch of skills to use out of context. The program is meant to work in cohesion with a bunch of modules, so asking for specific skills without any understanding of the program as a whole defeats the purpose of DBT. 

Third, you don't need a BPD diagnosis to do DBT--it's a program that's used to treat everything from BPD, (C)PTSD, to substance use disorder. If you have general mood issues (which I assume you do if you're looking for a BPD diagnosis), there's a good chance DBT will help, so yes, I do recommend this program for you. A DBT program provider will likely have an individual therapist in-clinic that can work with you, as well as groups they run. You can also look for DBT therapists and groups separately if you prefer. 

Finally, just from personal experience, I encourage you not to put so much weight on diagnoses--they're basically tools for insurance, but I actually think they're sort of terrible at describing the human psyche, and fixating on them distracts you from the real work of fixing your issues. Humans don't really belong in neat little boxes. My ""diagnosis"" list is like...literally 15+ disorders if you compile everything a mental health professional has labeled me. But honestly if you need 15 labels to describe someone adequately, the system is broken, not you. Getting a label won't fix your issues--understanding the root causes and treating those will. 

Hope some of this helped. If you're already in DBT, I'm happy to discuss more about how what you've learned can help you. Sending love and kindness; I hope you will find the help that you need <3"	SomethingProbablyIdk	reply	na	na	na	0.014798569492995739	strong	no	strong	na	dbtselfhelp
"do you know anything about ACT?  CBT engages you with disputing troubling thoughts and seeing through distortions.    but ACT is not interested in the content of thoughts and sees attempts to dispute as a struggle that cannot win and is on fact part of the problem.

"Highly recommend DBT; it changed my life! I don't think it's some all-encompassing therapy method that solves all your issues, but personally I think it's the best foundational therapy--you gain basic levels of self-awareness, identity, and stability most effectively with DBT. 

I'm glad you can recognize your fixation with diagnoses; it's a feeling I relate to but personally it was ineffective for me. I think that as long as you can find the correct treatment for your particular quirks/obstacles, the label doesn't really matter--your behavior and problems remain whether or not a particular label is put on you.

"Over the past few yeras and specifically when I joined college, I was below average in everything : making friends, getting grades, looks ..etc 
This was not what I planned for college. The many disappointments I went through in college and by family members has caused a deeply rooted feeling of self-loathing.
I am not smart, not good, not special, couldn't get an intern in college, .. etc etc
Graduated, I found myself a job and decided to through it all behind my back. Start fresh and try again. I had a terrible manager and later on manager changed and came an even worse, ruthless one who competes with me ( we are the same age long story ) to prove that he understands things and I don't 
Reality? i really don't because those things take time. He is comparing my chapter one to his chapter 100 just to crush me.
He is good at doing it I admit and my self-loathing seemed to never ended at first place. It is slowly eating me up and geeting constantly fed by my peer who is manipulating me.
Although I realize all of this, I have no energy to defend myself and no idea how to break the loop.
I so tired as a result of years of self-hate and questioning self-worth.
I am done and really want guidance on what to do.

"First of all, are you in DBT? If so, are you looking to join something more than the regular DBT group? Per the wiki rules explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dbtselfhelp/wiki/faq/promoteonlinemeetups?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1), we don't allow for informal group suggestions. But if you're not in DBT, I think it would help you find the support that you're looking for. 

Second of all, I'm just noticing a lot of judgment in the way you talk about yourself and others. You say you're ""below average in everything,"" for example; your previous manager was ""terrible,"" your current one is ""just trying to crush you,"" etc. If you do know DBT, I think that focusing on the mindfulness module and especially non-judgmentalness would help you gain kindness toward yourself. 

Just based on this post alone, I would personally recommend Learned Optimism by Martin Seligman. I would also look into Brene Brown, particularly The Gifts of Imperfection. I think self compassion and non-judgmentalness can serve you a long way. If you have mood issues and are not in DBT, I also recommend joining group, but if it's just self-esteem, I honestly think that you should try regular CBT first to focus mostly on that, then move onto DBT if you still want more help."

"I'm new to DBT and today attempted a skills I recently learned: Describe, Non-Judgemental, One-Mindful and Effective.

After trying and truly forcing myself to do it (I have a mentality where I stay hurt because it feels justified or validating, but I know it hurts me more), I feel like I don't care anymore. I'm not upset or angry; I just don't care. I felt how I felt, sure I was hurt.

I've expressed that ""I feel hurt because I wasn't told of (something that happened) and I just found out on my own by accident. I made a boundary of being given a heads-up, but that wasn't honored. I don't feel angry. I do feel disappointed. From now on, I will struggle to trust your words.""

I'm not sure if I expressed this right. But after going through the exercises, I'm thinking, I said what I needed to say, I don't care anymore. If the person truly hears me out, they'll try and do better  through actions. If not, I guess that's that. Not my problem anymore.

"No one can access your mind, so I think it's really up to your wise mind to decide if this was truly effective. If you feel that you've stuck to your values, and you feel this is an effective strategy for you in the long run, I think your goals are generally met. 

From personal experience, I think it's perfectly normal to feel that you're doing something ""wrong"" when using effective coping strategies for the first time. In fact you're doing things right, but after toxic patterns for so long, the right things can feel wrong, if that makes any sense.

"It is metaphorical. It's a visual/imaginative skill meant to put distance between you and the intense emotion/reactivity. 

It means to visualize a box on a shelf you that you can't reach...conceptually putting the problem or people/wtv is distressing IN that box and then when the box is shut or locked you don't think about the situation anymore... because it's forbidden (by yourself). 

It's a temporary solution until you can deal with the problem later on, in more effective mental state. 

For example: if you're really bothered about something but it isn't appropriate to have a confrontation or have big feelings at this moment (maybe at work or just when you are feeling out of control or nearing meltdown/shutdown) you might try one of the visualisations to help let go of the feelings and not perseverate/get stuck on that feeling/situation, and allow you to get through whatever task/thing you have to do in that moment.

"This is tough and I struggle with it myself but it truly is super helpful once you’ve practiced it for a while:

Radically accept your anger and “ride the wave”.  I find that particularly with anger, working against it (as you put it “trying to stop”) can be counterproductive and you end up with extra anger on top of the original anger. 

This is how I was taught to “ride the wave”:
1.	Mentally “take a step back” from your anger
2.	Call it out (“I feel anger/rage/whatever”)
3.	Rate it’s intensity (0-100)
4.	Mindfully take note of how the anger feels in your body
5.	Mindfully take note of your angry thoughts 
6.	Mindfully take note of what impulse to act you have (e.g., yelling, breaking stuff…)
7.	Tell your self “I’m experiencing anger but I am not that anger”
8.	Start over at one and repeat until you can feel your anger ebbing away

I also like to include some validating sentences, for example “It is okay that I am angry, this doesn’t mean I have to act on it”, “My anger is trying to protect me — I thank it for that, feel it, and let it go”. Maybe write down some of your own that feel good for you and read them to yourself when you’re feeling inappropriately angry. :)

I hope there’s something helpful in there for you. You’re not crazy, your brain adapted to an environment where it didn’t feel safe, it’s just trying to protect you. Be patient with yourself as you re-learn regulating your emotions.

I’m unsure if this fits for the situation, but when I have unjustified anger toward someone I love, my go-to is non-judgmental stance (NJS). My brain jumps right to “they’re doing this maliciously” when really it’s probably just thoughtlessness or ignorance. I also check the facts of the situation before acting (ODP), which involves trying to see things from the other person’s point of view given their context and having empathy for the challenges they are facing or the life experience they bring to the situation that we might not fully understand. However, if your BF was genuinely being an a-hole and this is truly something that will not go away, I’d jump straight to mapping out a DEARMAN.

"hey friends! i've been having a lot of trouble lately managing the emotional impact of transphobic legislation in my home state (florida). while i do have plans for leaving florida, they're not something i can act on immediately, and in the interim i've been feeling really anxious. 

i've done a lot of ""fit the facts"" skill work and i think the emotions are pretty rational. fear fits the facts if your health or well being is actively being threatened and mine very much is. but as a result of that anxiety, i've ended up dissociating a lot more often than i'd like, and i'm having trouble fulfilling basic day-to-day tasks as a result.

a lot of the distress tolerance stuff i lean on is self-comfort and self-care, which is great in the moment, but it doesn't last long, and can't really be done while i'm trying to work. comparisons have been failing me lately as well because unfortunately the state of florida is... pretty genocidal as of late, even when compared to other states. 

i'm not sure what to do next. i know i want and need to get work done, and i hate having to take mental health days because i cried myself to sleep the night before. any advice would be very much appreciated."	kadybat	post	30.561196998576392	female	White	0.9978176355361938	na	na	na	13	dbtselfhelp

"I'm really sorry you are going through this. I am genderfluid and while I don't live in USA I am watching what is happening there and feel very sad for the Queer community. 

Have you tried to practice Radical Acceptance here? I know that may feel like an impossible task but I think its important. Remembering that Radical Acceotance does not mean agreement with what is happening and it doesn't mean that you stop fighting. 
I find that practising Radical Acceptance of large scale injustices helps me to find where I have the control to change the situation and, in your situation, to keep yourself safe. 
If you haven't already maybe try doing a Circles of Control exercise to find where you can take back some power? 

I also think mindfulness would be super helpful. Maybe try adding a mindfulness practice to your daily routine and if you've already gone one maybe try extending it? 

One of the powerful things you can do as a Trans person to change the system is to really live your life. Being present in your life is a Radical act of rebellion against transphobia and hate.

"I've been through DBT and have it well integrated into my life for years now, and am struggling so fucking much with this too. I think when dealing with something of this scope, it is beneficial to incorporate some values stuff from Acceptance Commitment Therapy too. Since you're in Florida though, I'd suggest:

- identify the emotions and experiences that are causing the most distress, and identify the clearest or most direct causes of these. If you can't find a cause, look for anything that makes these more intense or contributes to them. You may find **chain analysis** helpful for this  

- look at these things,  and identify anything that you have control over and can reduce the impact of for yourself in this moment. You might not see any, but try to avoid binaries and look for any moderate or small improvements, because these can accumulate. This will also mean identifying anything where the distress or danger comes from yourself or your actions. This is fine, and normal. Your animal brain wants to keep you safe but isn't caught up to being human

- look for those things that represent a direct risk to you between now and when you are able to move, and rank or organize them by how much you're concerned about them. If they are conditional, like applying only after a given date, a certain circumstance etc, note that  

- when ready, go through the **problem solving flow** from Emotional Regulation for these items. Remember that when we brainstorm, nothing is unreasonable and everything is welcome

- since these are a big deal, be sure to do whatever you usually do for distress tolerance and emotional regulation to care for yourself. You can break these things up into substeps and not do them all at once

- from there, identify any actions you can take based on those brainstorming ideas. Remember some things aren't going to be solvable, but you can likely find a way to cope better or reduce risk. Cognitive flexibility is our friend

That's the distress side of things. Then, I would recommend digging into the part of Emotional Regulation that sets you up for positive emotions and experiences in the future, unrelated to the distress. While we survive, it's tempting to focus only on coping and forget that distress tolerance and emotional regulation skills dovetail and work together. For example, the distress tolerance skill of **Improve the Moment** (I forget the name, part of Wise Mind ACCEPTS) its with the emotional regulation skill of **ABC PLEASE**.

It can also help to shift one's view of the larger skills and what they're used for. Marsha Linehan spoke to this at one point describing the need for distress tolerance as coming from our inability to work through more then one thing at a time; she gave a metaphor of a set of jars on the wall, each needing attention and using distress tolerance to keep things going with them set aside, until the time comes to address them and you're prepared. Emotional regulation does the hard work, and sets us up for future success, hopefully allowing us to find some hope.

I hope this helps, or at least gives a different way of approaching this. As another queer non-binary person, I also just want to say that I don't know you but care deeply for your well being. Thank you for asking for help so openly and struggling to keep going."	kadybat	reply	na	na	na	0.9978176355361938	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
I feel this. It's so scary hearing about potential legislation, even more so when that legislation passes and you need to accept that this is reality now. I appreciate all the skills you're using to keep yourself as safe as you can, especially the problem-solving. For me, when I need a long term distress tolerance skills, I use IMPROVE the moment. It's gotten me through so many distressing periods of my life! Imagine: what will life be like when you're safe again? Imagine all the people working to bring safe legislation back to your state! Meaning: how can you use this frightening time to help others. Will this period in your life motivate you to get into politics/counsel trans youth/be a part of a movement that changes the world? Prayer: who can you pray to to give you strength? Is it god? Or maybe someone like Marsha P Johnson? The skill goes on.

if you currently are on HRT and are worried about that I've heard talk about how it is (or will be) labeled the same way it is for cis people who need HRT and this is ESPECIALLY true if you are ftm and had your ovaries removed. so there's hope that they cant take away anyone's medication"	kadybat	reply	na	na	na	0.9978176355361938	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I think it makes sense that you'd feel intense sadness when you practice Radical Acceptance. Maybe feeling that sadness is the first step to being able to tolerate the distress of your current situation?
It sounds to me that you may need a period of real grieving and sadness over what is happening in your home state? Distress Tolerance isn't about deleting or avoiding difficult and painful feelings, or not thinking about them. It's about building your strength for living WITH those painful feelings, realising that the sadness is natural and normal and that feeling it is powerful. Being able to feel the sadness without being dragged down by it is the goal rather than not feeling sad at all. 

I think also Radically accepting that due to the current circumstances you may have sadness and grief with you a lot and that's ok. In the same way you would carry grief if you lost a loved one, watching hate rise in your home state is a grief that may not be avoidable.

"Are you in therapy? And are you part of any trans support groups? I would try to go through the cope ahead with them so that they can help keep you grounded and provide realistic advice. On Reddit there’s r/trans, perhaps you could ask there. 

I’d also do a lot of self-validation and self-compassion. You’re going through tough stuff right now. :(( 

Some ideas for how to cope ahead: (warning: could be distressing to think about. If you want to read on, perhaps try paced breathing and grounding and self soothing skills) 

>!If legislation takes away your prescriptions: acknowledge that it would be awful, yes, and validate that. Then think: okay, what would realistically happen. Maybe doctors would reject the law because it would go against their oath to “do no harm.” It would likely be challenged in court as well. Maybe you could see another doctor. Maybe you could get meds sent to you from out of state. Maybe you could travel out of state to get meds. Maybe you’d have an amount stockpiled that could get you through some time. !<

>!If you’re fully unable to take the prescriptions, then you could plan to taper down, as this can lessen any withdrawal effects. I’m sure there are many stories online of what people experienced when they stopped HRT (if that’s the prescription you’re talking about). This is a thing that has been done before. Many people have to stop taking HRT because of side effects, other medical issues, etc. You may have some withdrawal symptoms and notice gender-related changes in your body. You can read up on how to cope with hot flashes, etc. Stopping for a bit might not have much of an effect on your body, especially if you’re able to start it up again somewhat-soon if you move out of Florida (in this hypothetical situation). Read some experiences here: https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/2u7bne/what_to_expect_if_stopping_hrt/!<

>!Coping ahead for the other situations: They make it illegal for you to use the bathroom: potential ways to cope could be to just use it anyway (most people might not care or notice), use only single-use bathrooms (find them, make a map for yourself), go to the bathroom only at home if you can hold it, always go to the bathroom with a friend, etc.!<

>!If you the police are called because of the bathroom you chose to use: follow normal police interaction etiquette: keep your hands visible, comply with what they ask, say that you won’t say anything until you speak with your lawyer, etc. Maybe get a friend to film anything. (I don’t know 100% how to interact with police, so maybe ask someone else for better advice). Look up the names of some legal aid groups that could support you if you needed it, and trans advocacy groups you could reach out to.!<

But hey, those things aren’t happening right now. The laws haven’t been passed yet, right? I tell myself, “in this moment, I am safe.” (Encouragements) I’d keep doing grounding stuff too. 

And I’m sorry that the opposite action doesn’t last long and that you’ve been crying yourself to sleep. :( Sometimes, life just sucks, and DBT can help but can’t fix it all. I cried myself to sleep every day of 2020… it sucked. It is awesome how hard you are trying. When the opposite action stops working, some options could be to try again, or try a different skill.

"Diary cards:

These happen each group and were both the best tool and some days the hardest step. 

You will hear about distressing things (arguments with partners, stressful situations they that skills are useful for) on occasion, but along with those things you will probably have group discussions on how that situation benefitted or could have benefitted from dbt skills you will learn. 

Even my first day I was able to contribute because I had a different viewpoint than the current group had so I could help with ideas they hadn't thought of yet. The group aspect helps you gain perspective and practice understanding others in a safe environment. 

Skills:

The skills will be explained in chapters (at least mine were) and you will go through each chapter twice so you will get to learn and then relearn your skills to help them solidify.

Every day we practiced my favorite coping skill though, one-mindfully. It can be frustrating while you are learning, but it has helped me tolerate situations that would have sent me running from anxiety and stress. 

Taking a penny and studying it for one minute, acknowleging the stray thoughts and judgements as they try to distract and  waving them away mentally like a cartoon thought balloon. I still remember the smell of the penny and the worn down edges. 

Myself:

It's been ten years? Since I started dbt, and I still need to practice some things. But so many have just become part of who I am I sometimes forget that they are from dbt. I can stand up to my bosses, I can be open and honest with my partner, I can forgive what otherwise would have been the nastiest grudge with people. I am still working on using it to remember to love and forgive myself, not to judge myself but to encourage and remind myself what I actually need. 

Those first few meetings were scary, I didn't like people. By my second half I actually ran into one of the people who damaged me mentally, my former step-mother. With my group's help and my skills I never acknowledged her presence and I didn't let it affect my journey to now. Was the proudest I have ever been of myself. 

In the end:

You will get out of it what you are willing to put in. I needed to get better, to function. I put as much of myself as I could spare into it and never let myself try to skip a class for feeling too badly (unless I was sick sick). I couldn't afford to let my anxiety or depression or my bpd keep me away from learning to live again.

"Hi all, 5 months into DBT, almost done with my skills group, and I still don't feel like I can do any DBT skills in a way that is helpful. 

If I'm distressed, for instance, none of the DT skills feel helpful in getting through the situation. Instead, trying a skill just makes me MORE distressed because now I have the original problem plus a feeling of failure that I can't do these things that I know are supposed to help. 

Or, I know mindfulness is good for all sorts of reasons and something that may ultimately be beneficial for me, but I absolutely hate doing the exercises (whether it's sitting meditation or more active stuff) - so when I finish one my main experience is just to be glad it's over and dread the next time I have to do it.

"Stick with it, but also don't be afraid to take a break and give yourself some space.  


 I spent 3 years in DBT classes and in that time I think I managed my diary card maybe 1/4 of the time. I never had much luck practicing anything other than a few mindfulness and distress tolerance skills (which was more like ""oh so there's a name for this thing I already do a lot of the time). I quit during COVID because I hate virtual appointments and DBT wasn't helping my situation any.  


Now two years later, I call on DBT skills. I find myself reluctant to get up, so I put on my half smile and use willing hands. I'm angry and feeling willful? Time for opposite action. My son was upset over broken headphones, so I had him splash cold water on his face (T from TIPP) to calm down enough to talk about it.   


It turned out that I had issues I needed to work out before I could really have the space to see how the skills were useful. As soon as I realized what the root of my problem was and what needed to change, I was able to use the skills I learned before without much effort. I'm asking my therapist tomorrow if there's a DBT group in-person yet because I need to refresh.  


The skills are tools in your toolbox. It takes time to learn which tool you need when and how to use it. Sometimes you need to heal the hand that wields the tool first, to be able to use those tools correctly.  Sometimes you're using a hammer when you need a screwdriver.

"Thanks so much for your reply! I've definitely struggled to pinpoint specific behaviors (one of the many reasons I'm having trouble with diary cards, I can't think of target behaviors!). 

Overall I struggle with depression so on paper reading the skills many seem like they could be helpful - techniques to calm down, be in the moment, process emotions, etc. In practice, though, I haven't yet had an experience where I try a skill and feel like I coped with a situation better than had I not used it.

Yes! I hate being mindful of my breathing and it always seems to make me lightheaded. Maybe because I have asthma and I’m used to getting less oxygen 😝 I will say despite the lightheadedness, deep breathing definitely helps when I have anxiety.

"To be honest, if you don’t have behaviors you’re trying to change, then DBT may not be best for you. That being said, perhaps you haven’t found which behaviors could be making things worse? For example, for depression, target behaviors to reduce could be  

- isolating/withdrawing 

- skipping obligations or fun activities 

- neglecting self care (eating, sleeping, showering, etc)

- SH & s*cidal behaviors 

Target behaviors to increase could be 

- enjoyable activities 

- social activities

DEARMAN is probably my all-time favorite because you can pre-plan it, and it's really helped me in conflict situations that I have a lot of difficulty handling usually.  It's worked for me even in email and over text so I can address the situation even if I don't feel confident doing so face to face.

Having said that, DBT is not a cure-all, especially if you have underlying trauma to address...

"Hello, everyone! 

I recently started using the DBT Skills Training Handouts and Worksheets, Second Edition by Marsha Linehan, as a self-paced resource (I spend about 30 minutes a day going over each handout/ worksheet). I started with the General Handouts & Worksheets, and now I'm in the thick of the Mindfulness section, which is helping me a lot. 

I looked ahead to the next section (Interpersonal Effectiveness), started having lots of unpleasant memories of my past interpersonal conflicts, and found myself feeling upset. (I have Complex PTSD)

After finishing the Mindfulness section, can I switch the order and go from Distress Tolerance, Emotion Regulation, and Interpersonal Effectiveness? Or should the module order be kept as it is? 

I've noticed that other DBT workbooks have the module orders switched. Virtually all workbooks start with Mindfulness, but they have either Emotion Regulation or Distress Tolerance sections as the 2nd module, so my hunch is that doing the Distress Tolerance next isn't a bad idea, but I just wanted to ask around. (I'll also ask my current IFS therapist, who is familiar with DBT.)

"Yes, DBT would help, but please take note that DBT skills usually become effective [somewhere between the 6 month mark and the year mark](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22838-dialectical-behavior-therapy-dbt), so it's not a quick fix. And studies really only show overwhelming effectiveness if you do the ""full"" program--individual + group DBT therapy. 

So DBT is not a quick fix to abandonment issues, but if you would like to try it, [77% of patients no longer qualify for BPD after only 1 year of treatment,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4579507/), so it's an insanely effective way to treat BPD in the long run."	pamsbeil	reply	na	na	na	0.02368503250181675	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Hi. My best friend and I made plans this weekend for my birthday to see the Mario movie and have a sleepover. However, she is currently going through a very recent, very messy breakup with her boyfriend, and the three of us were very close. On Monday, she said she didn’t think we could hang this weekend and she would need some space. I felt sad, but I understood.

Last night. I found out she went to see the movie with another friend that was pretty non mutual with the boyfriend, or at least not as associated in the relationship. I am heartbroken. She has always been an amazing friend and I was so blindsided by this. I talked to someone about it. They think that she just isn’t thinking because she has so much running through her mind and on her plate with this nasty breakup, or that maybe it is just easier to hang out with someone who doesn’t remind her of the boyfriend. Everyone thinks she just needs time and space and it wasn’t a purposeful, malicious thing. But I’ve had toxic friendships before, so I’m extremely angry, hurt, heartbroken. She is also my FP. 

I know people aren’t perfect. I know people screw up or don’t think, especially in times like a breakup. She has never, ever done something like this before, which is why I don’t want to give up on the friendship. I understand that I am a bit of a reminder of the relationship and she just needs time. She always said that even though she may need time and space, I’ll never lose her as my friend. That’s why I’m so lost now. 

What skills can I use to process this hurt? I just keep crying and not sleeping and it’s making my family extremely concerned. What DBT skills can I use to craft a message to send her about this (when things are less stressful for both of us.) 

I want to keep this friendship. She’s never given me reason to think she’s a bad friend before this. But I know it’s something that needs to be addressed eventually."	Echidna_Intelligent	post	20.405519899542323	male	White	0.9988677501678467	na	na	na	1	dbtselfhelp

Hello, could someone in this community please advise me on how to get over anxiety brought on by meditation? I am diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and so DBT, meditation and mindfulness are the way to go for me. I’ve already experienced some of the benefits meditation brings; however, every time I decide to meditate daily, I develop crippling anxiety and hypochondria. Does this mean meditation is not for me? I did research online and there seems to be scientific evidence suggesting that in some rare instances meditation can backfire. Should I engage only in a certain type of meditation techniques? Which ones? Do I have to keep meditating and wait till everything subsides? I end up having unnecessary, expensive medical tests.

"Yeah, unfortunately I think it's relatively common for folks with BPD to do poorly with meditation. You're not alone at all! :) 

I'm not sure if you're in a DBT group, but DBT actually makes it very clear that mindfulness is NOT meditation. DBT is designed with people like you in mind, so it offers myriad mindfulness practices so that you can find what works for you. There are multiple lists of them in Linehan's DBT workbook--for example the Mindfulness Handout 4 (and subsections), though lists of mindfulness exercises are also scattered throughout the book (like mindfulness of thought, which I find the most useful albeit not necessarily the most pleasant). 

DBT also pretty much doesn't believe that every mindfulness exercise will work with everyone, so the expectation is that some of the exercises offered will fail. The point is to keep going through them until you find the ones you like. 

If you haven't joined a DBT group, I highly recommend it--they often also teach a variety of mindfulness techniques that you don't encounter in the workbooks."	BeetBourbon	reply	na	na	na	0.998467743396759	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Sorry to hear you are struggling, I have some experience of this, so do you mind me asking how long do you meditate for and which techniques do you use? There are many forms of meditation and mindfulness is only one type and some people don't realise that so end up doing more intense forms of meditation without realising, and intense mediation can be incredibly difficult and it's best not to do it without the guidance of a teacher - if you already know this I apologise for being patronising, but I just wanted to check! 

If you are someone who struggles with traumatic memories and/or negative intrusive thoughts then mediation can end up being a form of exposure therapy if you are not careful - ie you are forcing yourself to sit with your thoughts and emotions without doing anything to avoid, distract from or soothe them - which can be a very hard and upsetting thing to do. For some, this form of exposure therapy can be useful but it needs to be done slowly and with guidance. One way to practice mindfulness if this is a problem for you is to start with being mindful of things outside of yourself first, such as sounds, colours or patterns in your surroundings. You might then be able to move on to being mindful of senses ie taste, smell, movement, before trying to be mindful of body sensations. You might then be able to move onto mindfulness of thoughts and feelings, but only do it for a few minutes at a time, before returning to being mindful of things outside of yourself. Over time you might be able to spend longer time periods with your thoughts and feelings as you get comfortable with the practice, but there is no obligation on you to do this if it doesn't work for you - you can stick with the other forms of mindfulness.

"What u/localmuffinwhore said. DBT mindfulness isn't meditation, it's just practicing acceptance and bringing the attention back to an anchor. By opening awareness around our sensations, thoughts, and emotions, the gap between stimulus and response gets wider and we can practice new ways of dealing with the stimulus.

I worked in a DBT clinic for a year and would usually avoid teaching mindfulness with breath as an anchor because it carries the connotations of Meditation^(TM) and creates expectations of peace and relaxation or being a spiritual person. Instead, I choose super innocuous anchors, like: holding fingertips together like an evil Bond villain and focusing on the sensation of the fingertips, or touching thumb to each fingertip back and forth, or inhaling one color and exhaling another. The point is to take five minutes to bring attention to one thing, notice the other things our minds give us, and then return to the anchor, again and again, with kindness and gentleness toward any judgment that comes up. That's it.

&#x200B;

>every time I decide to meditate daily, I develop crippling anxiety and hypochondria

I'm not there and not your therapist, so I can't exactly tell you what is happening here, if your mindfulness is making you aware of preexisting anxiety or if the awareness of sensations gets your worry wagon going re:hypochondria, but mindfulness won't make the anxiety go away. I think mindfulness isn't relaxing so much as it is *relieving*, meaning I stop struggling to make the present moment something other than what it is, so all the added stress is gone and the emotion can run its course. But be gentle with yourself - don't feel the need to jump into longer mindfulness practice sessions or more frequent until you can tolerate it well.

If you have a therapist, I would talk to them about this to see what might be going on.

&#x200B;

>Do I have to keep meditating and wait till everything subsides?

This might happen, but it isn't the goal of mindfulness. The goal is to be aware even when our minds give us non-stop drama. The presence of distress isn't failure, it's just the truth of this present moment, so adding distress to the distress doesn't help anything. 

Easier said than done, so be gentle with yourself, take small steps, and start with easy anchors before going to more awkward ones."	BeetBourbon	reply	na	na	na	0.998467743396759	no	no	strong	na	dbtselfhelp

You could try a really light yoga practice or meditate while walking.

Also there are a myriad of different ways to be mindful. You don't have to sit on a cushion on the floor and be still for minutes. You can also sit in the sun with a freshly brewed coffee and enjoy the moment. The goal is to be in the moment, experience everything it has to offer (how does the coffee taste?

I started by sitting quietly, maybe watching classical music being played on YouTube. I concentrated on my breath if I could, but sometimes that was triggering too.

As I worked on that I slowly weened myself to just music, and then listening to what was around me for a short period of time while breathing slowly, and on up from there.

"Sorry, I didn't see your reply to OP before I made my reply (must have been a reddit glitch), I'd have worded it differently if I had!

The word mindfulness is a tricky one because it was a word that already existed in English with its own meaning before it was used to translate Buddhist terms, and it gets used by differently by different Buddhist teachers, and it gets used differently again by people working in mental health. The wiki entry on the word is quite good on this problem if you haven't already seen it.  In Linehan's biography she talks about searching for a word to describe the set of skills she had developed and lands on 'mindfulness' after reading Zen Buddhist monk Thich Naht Hahn's work, and the work psychologist Ellen Langer. So I think she is using the word in a specific way within the context of DBT. However, since she developed her therapy the use of word has exploded and entered popular culture, so I find that people can have a personal interpretation about what the word means and also use it interchangeably with the word meditation. (But of course the word meditation is also contentious and according to Wikipedia there is no universally agreed definition!) My comment to OP was just to make sure they were not trying out a form of meditation which is not taught within DBT. 

I learnt about mindfulness within a Thich Naht Hanh group and would describe it in that context as a state of non-judgemental awareness in the present moment which can be cultivated using formal practices such as sitting still and watching the breath, listening to background sounds, walking slowly etc - and all these formal practices would be described as forms of meditation (ie sitting meditation, listening meditation, walking meditation). So, in that sense I'm not sure mindfulness and meditation are things which can be divided from each other (very zen!😆) within Thich Naht Hanhs tradition. But I'm guessing Linehan is classifying only formal sitting practice as meditation and the other practices as mindfulness which would be in keeping with most westerners understanding of what meditation is."

I reached out to a friend and asked if they wanted to get coffee on Saturday and they agreed! It’s hard hanging out with friends when you’re an adult but I’m taking this as a win. Thanks again.

Hi , from what I understood about myself is that I have lack of interest(I am not interested in anything) and lack of excitement (I am not excited for anything). Due to these, I find my daily activities boring, even special occasions I find them boring. So, I need tips for this, what should I do?	a9sqr	post	12.602345004165894	female	White	0.9992528557777405	na	na	na	6	dbtselfhelp
"I'm sorry to hear you feel that way. Do you suffer from depression? Lack of interest in anything, even special occasions, is a big symptom of depression. There are lots of things you can do to help with depression to help get your interest and excitement back. 

One small thing - motivation and excitement is often something we have to work to create. Doing something fun, even when you aren't motivated or feel interested to do it, can spark the motivation and enjoyment afterwards. Don't wait until you get the urge to do something fun because the urge may not come until you've already begun to have fun."	a9sqr	reply	na	na	na	0.9992528557777405	strong	no	strong	na	dbtselfhelp
for picking an activity in the absence of motivation, it can help to connect it to a value. For example if you value exploration and have never done activity A before (juggling, dancing with eyes closed, drawing a pine cone, making spring rolls, etc), then when you do the thing regardless of whether it ends up being a fun or boring experience, you have accomplished something toward your value.	a9sqr	reply	na	na	na	0.9992528557777405	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
What helped me in the past was to plan an activity (even if I don't feel like it), basically take a score on how my mood is and how much fun I think the activity will be. Then I try to do the activity as mindfully as I can, and do the score again afterwards. Some things will be more fun/have more impact than I expected, and with some things I thought I like doing, it's actually not as great as I think.	a9sqr	reply	na	na	na	0.9992528557777405	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I just spoke to my therapist about this today. I have depression as well as ADHD and she said I have so many interests and things I want to do that I can't decide which because all sound good but then when I try it, I lose interest.  


It's also called Anhedonia and unfortunately, the only way to overcome it (as far as I know) is to just do stuff. Start with like just 5 minutes and if you enjoy it, keep going a little longer, but don't overdo it.

I was diagnosed with BPD a few years ago and actually implementing these skills are a huge struggle for me. I've gone through several therapists and am trying to find the right medication. I have very intense outbursts of anger that come on very suddenly and that's when I struggle the most to use these skills. I tend to use them after the fact once I've calmed down, but implementing them in the moment feels impossible at times. Any tips?

"The best thing to do is practice like crazy at times when youre not in distress. Youll get better at implementing them as you go along.

Dont worry. It took months of practice before i was able to calm myself down enough to use them successfully."	Quirky_Season_8668	reply	na	na	na	0.9975541234016418	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
It comes with practice. For now practice post factum and prepare ahead for how you gonna deal with these emotions next time they happen. I did that and eventually amidst the anger I suddenly remember that I needed to stop and breath. And then started thinking what I can do to help myself right now without hurting anyone in the process and remembered the skills I practiced. Now I automatically recall them during intense emotions about 85% of the time.	Quirky_Season_8668	reply	na	na	na	0.9975541234016418	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I get bursts of intense sadness instead of anger. I have had those blind rage moments too, but not as frequently.

Knowing what it feels like only gives me a few seconds of warning. I haven't figured out how to use this information to stop the mood swing yet, but I can at least leave the room and have it in private..."	Quirky_Season_8668	reply	na	na	na	0.9975541234016418	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Sometimes it just takes practice. Did you learn about STOP? (Stop, take a pause, observe, proceed mindfully) In the beginning, you might just be working on step 1, stopping — that is, remembering that you should use your DBT skills, and then taking that pause before reacting. The goal is to get to the point where in that pause, your mind begins to slow down enough that you can take a moment to decide how you want to respond to the stimulus. 

I don’t have BPD but I have PTSD so I understand those quick, intense waves of anger. My doctor put me on Lamictal, which is sometimes used for emotional regulation. Medication might be something to consider as well, if you’re not currently taking anything.

EDIT: With my condition, I’ve come to accept that I might struggle with triggers my whole life. My goal isn’t to eradicate the anger, necessarily, but to be able to manage it in a way that doesn’t involve lashing out at others or hurting myself. I’m a year out of DBT and I’m still working on these skills."	Quirky_Season_8668	reply	na	na	na	0.9975541234016418	no	no	strong	na	dbtselfhelp
"These are very core level skills, so it will take a long time to be able to use them deeply and constantly. I've been doing DBT therapy and workbooks for 4 years and I'd say I can use skills about 85% of the time, which I'm massively proud of, and has transformed my life. However, that's not even close to perfect!! So, a huge bedrock of the practice is self compassion and persistence. 

It's very hard to have the mindfulness to use DBT when in the heat of the moment, so I suggest that you gain some practice with looking into the future and the past. 

To skills/activities that can help you improve when and what skills you use are the practices of Cope Ahead and Chain Analysis. Cope Ahead helps you prepare for future situations by imagining what skills you will use while purposefully keeping yourself calm and centered, and then ""shaking off"" the experience afterwards. 

Chain Analysis is useful after a crisis/conflict/meltdown to help understand what factors contributed to the breakdown of communication or regulation.

Both of these skills are hard to do, they are multi step processes and can be emotionally arousing. I needed to do several with my therapist/group to even understand what they were. But now I use them a lot and it helps me keep growing my use of the skills.

Best of luck in your journey, and cheers to asking such a great question."	Quirky_Season_8668	reply	na	na	na	0.9975541234016418	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I felt like that a lot in the beginning, too, and it can be hard to figure out! Try to be patient with yourself. Like others have mentioned, it takes practice. Don't wait until you're in the moment to try to use skills. Like any other skills, they take daily practice to master. Think of a pianist at a recital: they don't usually get on stage and just wing it, they practice, practice, practice beforehand so they know what to do when they get on stage. 

Practicing mindfulness as often as I can, especially noticing and describing my emotions even when I'm not in distress, has been extremely helpful for me. I feel like that's what opened the door for me to be able to implement a lot of the other skills, with STOP and opposite action being my greatest hits."

"I think the best way is to collect as much data as possible when you read the skills and think of as many (10+) situations in your real life when you could have used them. Recreate them in your mind and think of what could/would have happened if you had. Then write it down in great detail.

It’s a huge time sink, but I’ve found the best way to use the skills is to do a post-mortem of old, real situations and log them. Then see what could have been different had you used a particular skill. 

 Next time you have a similar one you’re much more likely to remember what happened last time, how this situation is similar, what you can do skills-wise, and how much more positively it can end if you can help it. 

But again, it’s it’s a huge time sink and can take weeks to do this. That’s why I think it’s best to do an IOP situation where you have the benefit of group therapy and can harvest other people’s experiences and outlooks and perspectives to bolster your own."

I can relate to this too well. I do the same thing (leave the situation if possible) and go sit and “ride the wave” while trying to just focus on my breath.

"Came here to post this. At the beginning, STOP was often the only skill I could remember, and I used it ruthlessly. I'd catch myself about to say something shitty and physically force myself to turn around and go into another room (act as if I had to use the bathroom, whatever). 

Practicing mindfulness throughout the day when you're _not_ dysregulated can also make it easier to reach for when you are.

Over time, as you learn to read and regulate your body and your emotions, it'll get easier to catch yourself earlier in the process, _before_ you've escalated to the point you can't hold it in. In the meantime, even buying yourself a half second to just... _not_ say the thing... can prevent quite a bit of relational damage.

The medication I've personally found most helpful for emotion regulation is guanfacine ER (Intuniv), but as far as I know that's primarily an ADHD medication, so I don't know if it's prescribed or if it would work for people with BPD or (C)PTSD who don't also have ADHD."

"No not really. I have DID, and because of amnesia between my parts, my memory and understanding of skills is patchy. Some parts are DBT wizards, some parts literally have no idea what DBT is, some parts don't have the verbal or cognitive abilities to learn the skills even if they wanted to. Because of this I allow myself a lot of grace with skills practise. It's pretty unrealistic to expect myself to maintain a daily routine when my ability to recall skills is changing hour by hour every day as I go through all the switching etc. Maybe in the future when more parts are more well versed in DBT it will be different, but it's probably going to take several years for me to reach that point, and that's fine. I'll take what I can get. One part who is a DBT enthusiast is better than none. Each part has to buy into it, in their own time.

"I’m new to DBT. I learned the skills years ago but never kept up with them so I’m trying again. 

I have a lot of background stress. There’s no need to explain. The net effect is that my tolerance for emotional distress is very low and I often wind up tipped into hopelessness. Something happened last put me in that spot again. 

Nigh on 24 hours later and I’ve not tried a single skill. One reason is that I can’t get past the notion that it’s all useless. My C-PTSD is not going to get solved by my head in ice water. But another reason is that I’m just not effective with DBT. 

So I’m on the couch and haven’t moved in about three hours. I keep trying to get up and I wind up back here dreaming up ways to self-harm. (Social self-harm, not physical). 

What is a good strategy to get off this couch? Can I have something small to do? What do you do when you’re so hopeless that you can’t even think straight enough to figure out what skill to apply?

"The thing I found with DBT, is that with a lot of the skills, you have to do them a bunch of times before they work. So like, trying things and feeling silly because it seems pointless, is a normal and necessary part of the process. Which is bullshit and annoying, but DBT isn't meant to be easy. You don't realise it's working until later, because it genuinely doesn't start working until later. Your brain needs practice.

One of the goals of DBT is to acknowledge that your thoughts of self harm are actually attempts to self-soothe, to figure out new kind ways to self-soothe, and to calm your body/brain so that you can purposefully put into practice those things. All those things don't come together instantly. Every little part takes practice.

The head in ice water thing is legit though. It triggers the drowning response which sounds terrifying, but it's just the reverse of the flight and fight response. It doesn't help long term, but it will shock you out of panic brain long enough to try different things. If you're able to get up, that is. Useless when you're stuck.

One thing that helps me with the paralysis brain is to give up trying to stand up. I just try to put one foot on the ground, as if I'm about to get up, but without the pressure of having to follow through. Sometimes just the act of moving is enough to break the ice, sometimes i just end up staying there with a foot on the ground. But it's one less step I have to take when I try again later. Also sometimes counting down from 5 works. This is an ADHD hack, but executive dysfunction is executive dysfunction, no matter what is causing it. Also this might not help today, but everytime I go to sit down in the couch, I take my water bottle. I fidget drink when stressed, so I always end up drinking the whole thing eventually. Yes I get hydrated and that's great or whatever, but also I will definitely need to get up and pee at some point. So it's like a timer that stops me from getting stuck all day.

I don't know if anything I've said is useful, I feel like I've just rambled. I mostly just want to say, I see you, you're not alone, this sucks, I wish you peace and smiles and sleep and comfort."	ultramagnus_tcv	reply	na	na	na	0.9993915557861328	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"You have to practice the skills when you are not in distress so that when you are in that spot it will become a natural reaction more than something you need a lot of efforts to overcome. That’s why DBT is a life long work rather than a sprint. Also you practice mindful skill frequently so you can recognize your emotion when its at a lower level. Then you use skills to help not let the emotion to get to level 9 or 10. If your emotion is at that high level, the only skills anyone can use is probably only distress tolerance skills, something simple as STOP. In the beginning it’s very normal that we are not able to catch our emotions but it will get better through time. Just need to trust the process. This is evidence proved method for people have emotion difficulties.

I can totally relate!! The TIPP skill that really helped me get started was paced breathing. When I feel anything really strongly (including apathy/fatigue/fantasy/urge to self harm) I try to do 10 slow, counted breaths. Sometimes I set a timer for 1 minute if counting seems unpleasant. Building up this habit took me like 6 mos, btw. When I do it, it helps my body chill out a little bit, and it gives me time to not wallow in my emotion- I'm just paying attention to my body and trying to make my lungs do as much respiration as possible. When 10 breaths/1 min is up, I can re evaluate where I'm at and if I want to take any action. Often, the answer is no, and I'll just keep lying there.

"I think the advice about timers is quite good. My personal thing was to pick only one skill that will have quite good efficacy ie. In your example, maybe something that will help you with intrusive thoughts. Just one really useful skill. This means less stress about what to use. 

Then you can break it down into smaller components and start there, and try to incorporate it into a habit. One way I started is, as soon as I learned how to thought-stop/ground, just practising it where I could for a couple of seconds. 

But main thing is - if you are sensing resistance, pay attention and find out what you are motivated by. The resistance will offer a lot of wisdom - is the DBT useless? Is your well-being not worth a shot? There might be a hang up about learning/practising from childhood.

Similar premise to STOP, don’t think it’s officially DBT. Thought-stopping is just whatever technique to stop a thought spiral in its tracks.

"I'm assuming the more specific the self-affirmation (in most cases) the better? Yeah, I enjoy combing DBT skills when it seems that will be more effective. It also is nice. Like, I'm getting effective with deep breathing techniques. So, I will do that as needed when I start to get frustrated. I also, will purposely unclench my hands, and try to shift to a less confrontational looking body language. The deep breathing makes that much easier to lessen the amount of body language that sets others on edge. I would never hurt somebody for anything other than self-defense. Strangers don't know that though. So, first I do deep breathing techniques, body relaxed more, then able to be more self-aware of my body language. Work on relaxing muscle groups. Being sure to unclench hands. Than I keep an eye on the body language, and repeat as needed. I've noticed by doing what I've described the other person noticably, with body language, relax when I do

"Ok so this is a weird one. I started a life goal today of learning to play the double bass. During my first lesson I was trying to stop myself from getting distracted by the emotion and participate. Then on my way home from work tonight I was telling a friend about it, ruminating on the memory of it and what I need to practice. What I noticed is I got so excited about it (I can’t really compare it to anything) that I noticed I was shaking almost uncontrollably from it. This was extremely triggering as I used to experience cataplexy episodes that lasted for hours at a time so was then hit with a wave of fear. now I’m worried that if I do experience any kind of “extreme happiness” it means that those symptoms will start up again. 

What skills have helped everyone with calming themselves down when they do experience this level of joy?"	tucktuck101	post	22.62183748921189	male	White	0.0023101510014384985	na	na	na	9	dbtselfhelp
"Hey there, 

So honestly, this sounds ineffective to me--the emotion you don't like is the fear you felt, *not* the joy. It sounds like you should be targeting the fear so you can feel joy more effectively. 

Skills I would use are: radical acceptance/check the facts that your hands can shake for a number of reasons other than cataplexy, opposite action to fear when you feel it, half smiling willing hands to feeling joy wholeheartedly, even if your hands shake. 

I can relate because after my first manic episode, I was so afraid of joy because I thought it meant I was going manic again. But you can't avoid joy--that's just self-flagellation. So another skill I had to learn was dialectics: I can feel joy, and it can bring on symptoms that are similar to my worst fears. But life's a mixed bag, and I'll accept it with willingness instead of willfulness. Because denying joy is indeed willfulness--it's trying to bend an impossible thing--human nature--under your control."	tucktuck101	reply	na	na	na	0.0023101510014384985	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

The facts of this situation is actually that you've experienced something that's pretty common, so it can actually be a number of things--using checking the facts to assume you have cataplexy again seems to me a misuse of the skill.

"All DBT workbooks have worksheets that basically function as journals, so you can either buy it or free copies exist online if you look for it. I personally photocopy it so I have a pristine copy at all times, but if you do a bullet journal you can also copy the format of the worksheets onto your journal.

I'll just note that studies show that DBT is most effective as a full program (individual + group DBT therapy and daily DBT practice), and success rate of the therapy declines as one takes away parts of the program. Self-teaching is very hard and requires a lot of discipline, and it is very easy to misunderstand concepts. I can't tell if you simply have a few BPD symptoms or if you're just waiting for the official confirmation you have it, but if the latter, I very highly recommend getting into an actual program. Especially if you have symptoms of severe BPD--at the worst of it, the cognitive distortions are too strong and personally I don't see how one can effectively treat oneself."

Straying from dbt the way I look at asking for the information is to as antithetical questions to disprove my hypothesis.

My hypothesis is coz they don’t like me, my antithetical question could be “hey I understand if you might be a tad busy, but when is a good time to catch up?” If they ghost me, then that’s a good sign that they don’t want to interact right now.

No drinking on days that involved negative experiences, like if I had a fight or if I ever felt down. No drink after strenuous workout (to aid my recovery). No drinking if I doubted if I should drink or not. Drinking max 1 glass a week. No opening of wine bottles if I am alone (because that would mean that I’d have to finish it in one or two days). I noticed that the less I drank the less I felt the need to drink. Often it became one’s every few months that I drank and I also stopped drinking in social situations. This was strange because I wasn’t used to ordering non alcoholic drinks when everyone else drank alcohol but I noticed that people reacted surprised but positively to it.

> * Community reinforcement is a skill where individuals learn to alter their environments in a manner that facilitates shaping abstinence behaviors.
> * Burning bridges is a skill that also helps the client alter the environment through making changes that increase the difficulty in accessing substances.
> * Building new bridges involves clients utilizing images and smells to compete with drug cravings.
> * Alternate rebellion is a skill where clients utilize less destructive ways to rebel, other than substance use.
> * Adaptive denial involves clients using their thoughts to motivate further abstinence behaviors.

Well no because alcohol wasn’t the root to why I had been drinking to begin with. You have to find what made you want to abuse drugs to begin with. I’m still finding those reasons and I’m 5 years clean so it’s almost a process of discovery that happens over time for most of us. Turns out I had difficult hand of cards being born with terrible disability and into a nutty family with a long history of trauma and drug abuse going back decades and decades. This clearly fucked up my development and so now I’m working threw those issues of trauma and working at my physical health because it goes hand in hand with your mental health. Creating a mindset of healing and growth and putting in the actual work on myself is what is helping me have way more happy days.

Personally there is no way I could realistically practice any of these sane ways to help myself in the middle of a physical craving driven by the insanity of the disease of alcoholism. These are great tools for someone who wants to cut back or continue a life of sobriety after finding recovery. I don’t believe I would have had the stamina or mental clarity in the beginning to find that recovery through DBT skills.	shortstack3000	reply	na	na	na	0.9913740754127502	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"The ice water one is one of the TIPP skills (temperature, intense exercise, paced breathing, paired muscle relaxation). Rapidly lowering your body temperature activates the mammalian dive response which drastically lowers your heart rate and physiologically relieves you from intense emotions. It’s a good one to know but i preferred paced breathing because you can do it anywhere.

Other good essential skills I use pretty much daily are the STOP skill (stop, take a step back, observe, proceed carefully), pros/cons, checking the facts, and opposite action. There are good videos on YouTube for all of them."	bozoberry	reply	na	na	na	0.9992621541023254	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Lots more.

Not sure whether this source falls under rule 7/8, but the book ""The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook"" can be gotten in one of its printings as a free pdf via google. Like, top 5 results. I'm fond of the book as it does not replace a therapist or group leader, but it does give worksheets and examples for the different aspects of therapy.

Effectivity is dependent on the person. I wouldn't put super-premium unleaded gasoline into a lawnmower anymore than I would change my cars oil with the 1 dollar 10W 2-stroke engine stuff.

Two of the easiest to begin working around you already mentioned. STOP and TIPP (pro-tip: you will benefit if you either like or can learn to like acronyms. There's a lot.)

STOP is what is sounds like. if things are going off the rails, you need to know that you have permission to stop, step back, take a breath, reassess your actions, and then re-proceed. Sounds simple, right? Now try it :D

TIPP is good for quashing emotional disregulation. Not always, but it's a group of skills that softly short-circuit your autonomous bodily systems to re-engage you with the present moment. Temperature (the ice thing; when I can an icy shower works a charm, but so to does ice water over the face), intense exercise to burn off the emotions and associated energy/stress, paced breathing to help bring yourself back to a state of being in-rhythm with yourself, and progressive muscle relaxation - self-guided meditation and relaxing your muscles.

Biggest advice that I have for you as someone new.

A lot of this stuff will feel like bullshit. ""The hell you talkin' about? This all sounds stupid or easy!"" And the secret is - it is. These are tricks that other people who don't let their emotions and minds run amok typically employ. There will be a lot of things that will sound like common sense, and so I would ask you in those moments to reflect in your mind on how you may have employed these skills in the past. The thing is - part of the benefit of DBT is that it reframes these typical behaviors into something that helps us. It's not that we don't Get It, its that we don't see an absence of something to Get.

"To my knowledge, eating every three hours is not a DBT skill. There's a general idea you should take care of your body but there are no specific instructions on how to do so. 

Honestly, it sounds like what you're looking for are CBT skills. Most DBT skills including TIPP, most emotional regulation/distress tolerance skills (check the facts, opposite action, pretty much all distracting skills, etc), and even some interpersonal effectiveness skills (FAST) are all CBT skills that have been organized into a specific framework. The only uniquely DBT skills are really the mindfulness module and dialectics/half smiling willing hands/etc--what makes DBT special is how it organizes and explains all these skills. If you remove the framework and only want quick and easy skills outside of its context, you just end up with CBT again. 

All in all, I'd recommend checking out CBT skills because it sounds like that's what you're looking for--there are uniquely DBT skills, but they're the sort that take a long time to master, and it sounds like those aren't what you're looking for."	bozoberry	reply	na	na	na	0.9992621541023254	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
Yeah that viral tiktok video rubbed me wrong and I was afraid of seeing a post like this. I believe she’s usi that skill of eating every three hours for more than DBT maybe she has an ED history we’re unaware of. Eating every 3 hours is not a skill you are really taught in DBT (that I’m aware of at least) she probably adapted it as a schedule for herself to remember to eat. The skills I find myself using every day are - STOP, TIPP, opposite action, 1/2 smile, check facts, and a few others. All I have to mindfully work on daily, read about, journal about, and actually remember to do too. DBT is a lot of practice and skills don’t just flow through after reading or learning about them once. Try some YouTube videos! There’s also so many free pdf of the DBT skills out them in your walls and where you see them most.

"I would say it means when learning one of these new perspectives/ways of thinking, it’s not that we don’t understand— it’s not seeing anything new *to* understand. Like, some sound pretty obvious at first, but w/ deeper understanding of how much looking at the world through this lens changes things, they’re actually biggies. Going “oh, there’s nothing to learn for me here, I already think like that… wait, do I?”

Radical acceptance is a good example of this. Upon hearing it, it sounds chill: accepting that what happened happened and you can’t change it. But the therapists who taught me this skill said they’ve seen ppl trying to Radically accepted things get *super* upset the more they think about it— storming out, throwing things, punching walls. It’s also accepting the things in your life that feel incredibly unfair and you might still carry anger about, like being scammed out of money or trauma bc of abuse. You might still try to fix or change them somehow, even though they’re in the past.

Crucially, Radical acceptance doesn’t mean that those things *weren’t* unfair or painful. It’s not the lie that “everything happens for a reason”. It’s just saying “alright, that sucked. That was horrible and shouldn’t have happened. But I accept it was real, it did happen, and I can move on with my life.” Putting the past in the past, and additionally accepting that unfair horrible things might happen in the future. But you’ll be able to accept those happened, too, and move on when it’s time. To continue radically accepting and keep using skills.

"The other replies are exactly what I was going for.

To frame it. Under best circumstances, a person who becomes greatly frustrated by a task may push it too far, or may back down and give themselves time to reassess the situation, determine what aspect is frustrating, and focus on resolving the frustrating aspect so that the task at large can proceed.

Let's jump back a few years. I was on a hike. It was a little chill, so I had a coat. The coat shortened the amount I could move my arms a bit. It was windy. The wind was constantly blowing in my eyes, and gusts throwing me off balance that I couldn't move fast enough to recover. It was on a slight incline with some scrambling. I was constantly falling back a few steps because a gust would come, put me off balance, and the scree would give and I would fall. Over and over and over and over and over. It didn't occur to me to walk lower. It didn't occur to me to swap out my coat for something lighter. It didn't occur to me that I was slipping because of the trail. It was the wind. IT WAS THE WIND. ITS THE WINDS FAULT. AND NOW MY FUCKING HOOD IS SWIRLING AROUND AND - \*rip\*

Ripped the hood clean off my jacket. Just kinda sat down and thought for a bit, stared at my hands, and turned around. Still haven't found a tailor to try and salvage it, and I may have destroyed my favorite hiking coat. Because it was windy, and hiking a different trail, or any other alternative, did not occur to me. There was only This Trail, and my inability to hike it.

It's been a while since my frustration has reached that level. Last thing to lose was a branch I was taking apart anyways; big-ass thing just wouldn't cut all the way through with the saw so I threw it over the curb, jumped up and down on it, and when it snapped it smacked me right in the shin. I deserved that, not cause I'm bad but because that was really stupid to do and what else should I have expected?

I have learned to ""STOP"" when things are getting that bad. I know to use TIPP skills to shock my system out of whatever recursive cycle it's stuck in. I practice mindfulness by meditation in the mornings and afternoons to keep me in the here and now instead of dwelling on how stupid it was to rip the hood off my coat 6 months ago, or far in the future worrying about the next time I lose control. And the concept of doing those things... it wouldn't occur to most people to need to think of the concept of stopping yourself going out of control as a set acronym of defusal techniques, or that you would need extra assistance to physically calm your body down when things are running away.

Therein is another consideration as you move forward through life: it takes practice, but work towards living Willingly. To be willing to accept that there may be poor outcomes, and there may be good outcomes, as a result of actions, and that while you'd hope for good that the world has not ended if things didn't turn out. Living Will*fully* is the thought of ""Well, someone's gotta do it, *and I guess it's me. Joy.""* The idea of jamming yourself into situation because that is what is in front of you, goals or outcomes aside. The thought of ""I'm going to fucking do this thing if it's the last thing I do...!"" That's sounding kind of like me from my example, isn't it?

Again I'll say. Give yourself time. Rome wasn't built in a day, and changing the way your thoughts work ain't easy. But it *is* admirable. And it is worthwhile."	bozoberry	reply	na	na	na	0.9992621541023254	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Well, that depends on what you mean by ""interpersonal effectiveness."" The module system and the grouping of certain skills within certain modules are all unique to DBT. But the vast majority of the skills themselves are actually CBT skills that have been tweaked to fit into these modules. For example, check the facts is actually a skill that comes out of CBT/positive psychology in the ~60's-70's. Similarly, there are multiple skills in the interpersonal effectiveness module that Linehan didn't come up with from scratch. For example, a version of DEAR MAN, GIVE FAST is often taught (as separate skills, not in one grouping like DBT) in couples therapy. So no, many of the individual skills of interpersonal effectiveness are not unique. What is unique is how they're bundled together and taught."	bozoberry	reply	na	na	na	0.9992621541023254	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

i think of reasonable mind as kind of like being caught up in thinking - like planning and scheming and overthinking. you're stuck in your head, and you're not in your body at all. the goal is to get back into your body, so I've had luck with things like noticing breathing, body scanning, maybe other kinds of mindfulness.	cardgan	reply	na	na	na	0.9865389466285706	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Absolutely echoing what others have said. 

Just wanted to add that you're right It's probably fair to say DBT definitely has a tendency towards emotion mind --> wise mind, rather than the other way around. That's DBT trying to help people move more from having 'under control' in emotion skills. 

There's a therapy based on DBT that does the opposite - helps people who have too much control over their emotions get looser (ie like reasonable mind --> wise mind).

4.) this would depend on the clinic you intend to receive services from.  

5.) this would depend on whether or not your provider bills insurance and if your insurance has mental health benefits.  

6.) most groups i’m aware of last for a year - this allows the opportunity to go over each module twice with mindfulness being done between each module.  each module lasts about 4 weeks in my group.

Knowing that months of in life practice will help me in my understanding when I get the opportunity to go to group therapy again. DBT takes practice for skill building, preferably applied in real life when you need it and/or recognize it might help reduce emotional intensity. There's more to it I could type here.

Today is 6 months since I was seconds away from ending my life. I've felt some guilt over it before, but it's been stronger recently. It was bad yesterday. I helped my grandma with something and it made her happy. It was also the birthday of her son that was murdered in '98. I couldn't stop thinking about how I very nearly killed myself and how horrible it would have been for her. Especially since I have been feeling better recently, I feel a deep guilt and shame over what I did. What are dbt skills that I can  use to try to deal/work through this?

"I’m still learning about DBT myself, but I just want to say, I’m very glad you’re still here and so are the people in your life. You said you feel guilt and shame about what you “did” - but you didn’t do it. You’re still here, and it sounds like those feelings are coming from a hypothetical place. 

It might help to take opposite action whenever you’re feeling this guilt/shame come up? Turn it into a celebration and fill yourself with gratitude. List out all of the things you’re able to do because you DIDN’T do it. List out all of the people you’re able to spend time with, all of the family members you’re able to bond more with, all of the love you’re able to give and receive, all of the happy memories you’re able to make. Try to ground yourself in the current moment and appreciate things like helping your grandma - because you didn’t do it. You didn’t do it, and it didn’t happen. And that’s incredible."

"Guilt and shame are complicated emotions. 
When we feel Guilt it is because we have done something which doesn't line up with out personal values/morals. 
When we feel Shame it is because we have done something which might see us 'rejected' by our social groups. 
When we feel these emotions they are communicating a need to us. Sometimes the emotions can be confused though. We might feel intense Guilt but when we check the facts we realise the emotion may be being exacerbated by rumination and assumption rather than fact. 

From the very small amount you've shared it seems like your Guilt springs from the possible hurt you may have caused your loved ones and your Shame is springing from a belief that your loved ones would be/are upset that you may have acted on your suicidality. 

If you check the facts for this you can see that, while your emotions are totally valid and understandable, they are not fitting the facts of the situation. 
1. You didn't act on that urge so you're feeling Guilt for an alternate reality where you did act 
2. Depression and Suicidailty are serious and incredibly difficult to manage and your past self needs Loving Kindness not Shame for feeling that way. 

My go to with Guilt and shame is to say directly to the emotion ""thank you for warning me that acting on my desperate urges goes against my values and would hurt my loved ones. You're trying to keep me alive and I appreciate it. I don't need you now, I've learned what I need to learn from you"" 

And try to show yourself Loving Kindness now. Your emotions are valid and normal, but you don't need to punish yourself by ruminating on those emotions. You are alive! You survived! You are, I assume because you're in this group, trying hard to build a life worth living for yourself. Try to challenge the emotions and beliefs that you hold. When you feel Shame try to replace it with Pride for surviving suicidality!"	IDoBeVibing745	reply	na	na	na	0.027893584221601486	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"So I actually tried twice to in a month and survived before I started dbt. I’m currently 4months out from that point and living through the consequences of my actions, but I want to share what’s helped me deal with the guilt and shame.

- remembering it was a choice. I give myself validation for the feelings I felt but I don’t validate my actions. I.e I had a free helpline saved to my phone and should have been calling more often because of the emotional mind.

- I am compassionate to my own circumstances and acknowledge that at that time, I needed urgent professional help and should have seeked it out sooner. 

- I validate the guilt and shame, because I did leave such an impact on those I cared about and that action has turned my life upside down. But, I don’t let it be anything more than acknowledging that is what I experiencing, which at its core is just sadness.

- that validation I do feel sadness regarding my actions, that is part of my self motivation for DBT. So when it hits, I ride it out and use the mindfulness module to slow down my “racing/rumination/judgemental” emotional mind and be kind start thinking about how to make it not happen again and if I am doing all those things. 

- I am slowly “turning the mind” (dbt skill) to not only radically accept that I did, but to know if I never want to be in that situation again, I have to do the māhi (work) to get the results I want. 

As I’m writing this out, I am sitting on the deck after one of the hardest days I’ve had to deal with emotionally. Today was my younger brothers wedding and I was his best man. I had to read a poem and give a speech. this wedding was delayed because he had spent over a 8 months in hospital after a car crash and has an almost life long recovery ahead of him. The consequences of my actions is that I didn’t get to come home after that hospital trip to my wife and kids. They were there too. Today was a day drenched in guilt, shame, regret and heartbreak, while also supporting a person I cared about in their happiest moments for something I thought I’d never see at one point. 

Being mindful of my emotions, how I felt, using half smile and willing hands + improving the moment by focusing on my kids and how happy I felt for my brother and his wife etc, reminding myself to be present and to process the rest when I have time, like I explained above, is how I got through it. 

Sorry for the long rant 😅 I just kinda can relate to this a little too well, especially after today."	IDoBeVibing745	reply	na	na	na	0.027893584221601486	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Lately, I’ve been finding myself becoming more and more dissociated when I talk to my friend. To be fair to myself, this friend has kind of been giving me a lot of red flags by saying insensitive, invalidating, uneducated, and unsupportive things to me. 

I’ve found myself being emotionally supportive of this friend, while this friend may randomly take “breaks” (noticable periods of time, more or less than a week) from talking to me. I’ve also found myself uneducating a lot of this friend’s ableism, only to feel like this friend isn’t really “listening” or “processing” what I’m saying, and then to be on the receiving end of more uneducated things they say. 

I’ve been in friendships where conversing with the other person has left me emotionally drained and “spent,” but this current friendship feels a bit worse, since now I have noticed I find myself in a somewhat dissociated state to minimize the impact if they happen to say anything insensitive or offensive. 

I have been doing my best to call out my friend when they say offensive things, however it also feels like there’s a buildup of [red flags]/stuff that I just have not been able to address. The friendship kind of “feels” unhealthy, since I’m estranged from my f*mily while their f*mily dynamic is stable, they have a partner, I don’t, they have “close friends,” my friend is pretty much my only friend, and they have other priorities (school, being a student athlete)

I know that positive experiences can lessen dissociation, but is there anything else that’s effective? It just feels hard to be present in a friendship that feels doomed to fail. 

Some of the stuff the friend has said has been kind of triggering, so at the risk of triggering a fellow sensitive person, I chose not to share. Thanks for listening to me, and advice is appreciated."	I_am_something_fishy	post	16.267095729204954	male	White	0.9993892908096313	na	na	na	2	dbtselfhelp
"I asked a similar question about dissociation a few months ago so you may find the answers [there](https://www.reddit.com/r/dbtselfhelp/comments/10htnd7/dbt_skills_for_dissociation/) useful. 

But it sounds like maybe you're more upset about this relationship than the dissociation per se. I can't tell if your friend sounds terrible because you're splitting or because they have genuinely terrible qualities, so I encourage you to use dialectics and wise mind. With politics, I think that there are definitely multiple versions of the truth, but I acknowledge it's very exhausting to keep fighting about it with a loved one. If the relationship is untenable it may be better to look for people with views more similar to your own. Or simply draw a boundary and stop talking about the subjects that trigger you."

I feel silly asking this, but are mindfulness and wise mind supposed to be 'states of being' or just techniques to be used as necessary?	cardgan	post	34.7283776482424	female	White	0.9978563189506531	na	na	na	11	dbtselfhelp
Going against the grain a bit but personally, the answer is yes. Remember that you can be in wise mind and still participate, and wise mind is the combination of both emotion mind and rational mind, so you should still be accessing both. Wise mind is also not 50/50 rational:emotional; some situations require you to be more rational, and other more emotional, but recognizing how much you should emphasize of each is indeed wise mind. So to me, yes, you should aim to be in wise mind, and this does not deter you from living life to its fullest; on the contrary, it *lets* you live life to the fullest.	cardgan	reply	na	na	na	0.9978563189506531	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"So, for me, wise mind is the state of being I try to always operate from, or strive to get back to when I am not regulated. Mindfulness is a vehicle I use to get there (in particular non-judgmental observation of my thoughts and body). 

When I know I’m not in wise mind, that’s when I pause, self-soothe, distract, etc."	cardgan	reply	na	na	na	0.9978563189506531	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"The way I think of it is that I let myself be in rational mind or emotional mind when it’s helpful to me, and when I need wise mind I use that. If I’m with my friends or at a concert or something where I want to be fully in my emotions then I let myself do that. If I’m doing math homework then I let myself be in rational mind. Sure, I can experience joy and happiness and think logically in wise mind, and it’s not like I forget how to use skills when I’m in those moments of rational or emotional mind nowadays, but I think there’s value to not thinking about it so hard and letting myself move through the states of mind freely in the moment until I need to be in wise mind.

Also, it’s not a daft question! There’s no such thing. Especially when it comes to DBT, the more you ask, the better you understand and the more it can help you :)"	cardgan	reply	na	na	na	0.9978563189506531	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"This is a pretty good question cuz I’m not sure what the answer actually is. 

My impression is step one is just recognition: am I in emotion mind right now? For me, asking “am I in rational mind right now?” Was especially important because I wasn’t allowing myself to really feel or experience my emotions, and I can be exceptionally talented at the art of bullshit and rationalization. And recognizing wise mind was crucial to having real emotional regulation, processing, and empathy. And getting out of judgment. 

But I do think it’s probably beneficial to try to get to spending more time in wise mind. I don’t think anyone expects 100% full time residence there unless you’re training to be a monk"	cardgan	reply	na	na	na	0.9978563189506531	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
I think the goal is to be able to use wise mind and mindfulness at the drop of a hat, even in challenging situations.

Ha! I used to be part of a Buddhist group before doing DBT so maybe I'm confusing monasticism with DBT! 🤣I've just been watching a few of Jennifer May's videos since posting this though, and I get the impression being mindful and using wise mind is supposed to be fairly full time. There are times, I'm guessing, when emotion mind or rational mind are more appropriate, as is being zoned out or reactionary, but mindfulness and wise mind are sort of the steady state to which you come back to I think, kind of like a homeostasis.	cardgan	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9978563189506531	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"A simple question without a silver bullet response. If there was one, it might be “safety starts and ends with you.” 

You have knowledge of a pattern you fall into to create safety for yourself that may no longer serve you. That’s the hardest step, knowing it’s there. So the new job moves to acknowledging the behavior in the moment and checking it. The other poster seems to have a rule, which works well for us. My attempt to resolve this behavior in myself, is trying to recognize the behavior, do a little 3 second meditation and run through the wise mind checklist.

"Hi DBT people.

I have a chronic condition that causes me physical pain and other uncomfortable bodily sensations. I've been finding that the more I practise mindfulness, particularly of my emotions as they exist in my body, the more I am aware of my pain and that makes distress go up! Oops. 

I was wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar, and whether anyone has found any work arounds for staying mindful while in pain? When I have a flare up, it's so hard to stay mindful, as my instinct is to get a bit of relief by checking out of my body. 

Thanks!"	gobz_in_a_trenchcoat	post	39.70154608660296	female	White	0.004314495716243982	na	na	na	10	dbtselfhelp
Some thing I find helpful is to switch between short periods of mindfulness of the body and mindfulness of something outside of your self, such as being mindful of sounds or colours in your surroundings etc. So I might be mindful of my body for a few seconds or minutes, and when it gets distressing I switch to being mindful of sounds for a few minutes until I feel less distressed and able to return to mindfulness of the body again. I find if I force myself to stay concentrating on my body I will dissociate, so I need to 'titrate' it with something else. Over time you might be able to stay with your body for longer periods of time.	gobz_in_a_trenchcoat	reply	na	na	na	0.004314495716243982	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"What I like best about how DBT approaches mindfulness is that it's not so much about 'meditation' type practices (unless they work for you) but rather about training your attention.... to that end, it matters 'less' what you're focussing on, but rather that you're learning to notice that your mind wanders to other stuff - including judgements, thoughts of 'this is uncomfortable, intolerable etc' - and developing the skill of bringing it back to the thing you're trying to focus on.

Therefore, to my mind, focusing on your body - as in a Body Scan practice - might not be the greatest 'entry point' practice for you. It might be easier to practice the skill in other ways, like the studying-a-leaf type practices. And then, when you've got a bit more brain space and a 'practiced mindfulness muscle' practicing the trickier exercises like Mindfulness of current emotion, body scan etc.

"I’m in a place where my health physical symptoms are intrusive enough that it isn’t helpful for me either.

So instead, I am focusing on a sort of emotional mindfulness for now. At one point, if I got upset about a stupid joke in a Reddit comment, I’d be very hard on myself. Like >!“Why am I mad on behalf of this footballer who definitely didn’t even see this, this is so stupid and I need to just stop having emotions about this.”!< And now, I stop, and say, “Okay, why is this making me have strong emotions? Clearly it’s hitting something that’s personal for me.” Which is how I figured out that an issue from my childhood that I thought I had dealt with needs a lot more work. 

One of my favorite bands released an album last week and two of my favorite songs are lyrically about stuff that isn’t super relatable to me … theoretically. And at first I was just thinking those ones were more fun musically, but with further thought, there is some stuff in those songs I relate to personally as much as I’d like to deny it. ([These](https://spotify.link/nfzMks7rkyb) [songs](https://spotify.link/75YxKi9rkyb) are about people in crisis and I don’t feel like I’m in crisis but…) Will be discussing it in therapy this week. 

I guess it’s just really taking the time to unpack how I react to things emotionally, even if it’s stuff like media that doesn’t seem so important. I find it can tell me a lot about stuff that I’ve buried to the point of it being subconscious because I don’t want to deal with it."	gobz_in_a_trenchcoat	reply	na	na	na	0.004314495716243982	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

I don’t know how where to begin with this… I did a behaviour chain anylisis and realised one of the most destructive behaviours I have is a mindset of “all or nothing”. This comes into my diet, my social interactions, my approach to work and dbt or kinda anything and it’s affecting my ability to do anything sustainable… it’s like I kinda just get bored of it and procrastinate doing anything with it. I.e I find a new interest, go head first into it and learn everything over multiple days and then kinda… loose motivation for it? Or I’ll over eat/not eat, set up a system one day to do xyz and stop using it or go from being really productive to just meh…. Not sure what else to use other than wise mind… but even then it’s difficult to apply it to things where there is no interest or there is an obstacle/limit that I can’t navigate in that moment…	tucktuck101	post	24.717538241756955	male	White	0.9977972507476807	na	na	na	4	dbtselfhelp
"I think this is pretty common for people with BPD/BD/some other disorders; it feels like you're describing a version of splitting. 

Mindfulness helps, but personally what I needed was self-compassion (which comes from loving kindness, radical acceptance, and dialectics) and self-knowledge (which was mostly mindfulness for me). I eventually learned that I couldn't live the perfect/consistent diet/work/etc. lifestyle because I get bored really easily. I can't stick to one exercise, or a meal plan, or keep a journal. You might have a different reason you can't keep to the same routine, but I encourage you to find the ""why"" that underpins the reason this doesn't work out for you. 

But if you're similar to me, not knowing that I need a different type of structure than what self help books/forums/etc. suggest made me take an ""all or nothing"" attitude--because the lifestyle influencers and even therapists would say things like, ""journal everyday!"" without giving me the insight that baby steps exist. This is also where the self-compassion kicks in--splitting causes the mindset, ""well I failed once so I may as well give up forever,"" and I think that having the self-compassion not to view yourself as a failure when you e.g. miss a day of exercise or eat junk food will make it more likely to keep whatever version of the healthy habit you can. Because it's *impossible* that you'll exercise everyday, or eat perfectly healthy, or do everything on time at work. Life always has curveballs, and it's dialectics to realize that ""all or nothing"" is a false construction (something you're clearly starting already!). I also think that opposite action is necessary to supplement the self-compassion--recognize you hit a stumbling block and you feel negative, but act opposite to your urges and try again anyway. 

If you're similar to me and the problem is the routine itself, not something else, it just means that you need to plan ahead even more than other people to make sure you're not boring yourself, and give yourself extra flexibility. Some people might meal prep 1 healthy meal and eat it all week; I make sure I have ~5 healthy breakfast options in stock all the time and pretty much make a new dish for every meal. I journal sometimes, but when I get bored of it, I post my ""journals"" to a very small group of friends on Instagram (cringe, but it works for me), or write it on my notes app on my phone and forget about it. Similarly, I have ~10 exercise plans I can jump between, from 10 minutes to 1 hour so that I can still feel like I did *something* for my ""routine"" even if I had a bad day and can't do the intense stuff. 

Hope some of this helps! TL;DR: use opposite action, self compassion (radical acceptance, dialectics, loving kindness); be mindful of splitting behaviors; radically accept that routines may not work for you, and in that case, problem solve to find what does."	tucktuck101	reply	na	na	na	0.9977972507476807	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"The 'dialectical' bit of DBT is exactly what you're getting at - it's all one way or the other, so you're needing the 'middle way' to even the extremes out. So luckily, DBT is exactly the therapy for the issue!

Exactly like the other commenter said, the ""why"" matters - so I did wonder whether one of the 'whys' might be there's a lot of emphasis on change skills, maybe? 

One of the most classic dialectics DB-therapists are meant to look out for is acceptance vs change - noticing if there's too much of one of the other. What that means is, if there's a reliance on ""Change"" skills, need to invest in more ""Acceptance"" skills. Those are basically your Distress Tolerance (particularly Mindfulness of Current Emotion) and Mindfulness skills. That's what self-compassion kind of is, really."	tucktuck101	reply	na	na	na	0.9977972507476807	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"I think the why seems to be boils down to approval from others that I care about or that sense of achievement 🤔 it’s like if I don’t think it will gain approval make someone else happy from the significant people in my life or is literally something that I do purely for enjoyment and take it too far (over eating junk like bacon Mac in cheese loaded fries with mozzarella and Parmesan or stay awake overnight playing a video game). It’s almost like if someone says I can’t do xyz, I’ll figure out the theory of how to do xyz and impulsively make long term commitments/impactful decisions to make it happen.  it’s something that helps as much as it harms my life. Just the way it harms doesn’t just impact me due to having a family. I Think this is a route cause to the behaviour that lead my wife to kick me out, as you probably can see how that mindset would play out in a relationship… 😬

So the skills I can think of the top of my head to combat it is stop when making a decision, pro vs cons, face the facts + radical acceptance when the decision is something that could have a bigger impact than say buying an energy drink. Opposite action when I am obligated in some form to do a task and have no motivation to… is there any others that I can try out?

"my best friend distances herself when things go bad, and i take it too personally

my two best friends have been dating pretty much since the three of us became friends. things recently have been very turbulent, and they’ve had a few moment of “we’re ending things” in the relationship but it hasn’t happened yet. it’s happening again right now, and my very best friend is taking space from social media for this reason. a few weeks ago she said she may have to take some space from people who remind her of the partner (so basically me and a couple others) but reassured me we would always be friends and that it would just take time to feel normal again

i feel like a garbage friend for feeling this way, but i feel angry she’s pushing me away because i want to be there for her and i never chose to be the middle man/third wheel friend. i just became friends with both of them at the same time, and it just makes me angry that i am constantly fretting about how things will change if they break up, boundaries, being friends with both, etc. i know neither one of them means to have me in the middle and we’ve talked about it before, but the taking space just sets off my fear of abandonment issues and i just. don’t know what to do. i feel lost without them and i’m afraid i may resent them for this. do i bring this up to them? how do i do this without sounding like an ass or like i’m trying to cross the space boundary"	Echidna_Intelligent	post	30.27848499417476	female	White	0.9946618676185608	na	na	na	1	dbtselfhelp
"Honestly this sounds exhausting reading this through; I'm sorry your friends are making you (and others) go through this with them. Relationship breakups are hard enough without having your entire friend group experience it with you. 

Personally, I would instead take this time to strengthen your relationships with others who aren't these people; I reckon you feel sadness from the loss of a connection, so opposite action/problem solving for this sadness would be to search for this connection elsewhere. Building relationships will also distract you from the drama your friends enmesh themselves in. 

Second, it sounds like at some level, you're struggling to radically accept that your friend(s) need space. Instead of wishing, ""I wish I can have my friend back,"" maybe it's more efficient to try, ""my friend needs space right now. What are my needs in light of this information?"" It may indeed be that you need to cut them out until they are less emotionally unstable for the sake of your mental health. It may be clearer communication and boundaries where, say, you guy meet up for coffee for 2 hours once a week instead of hanging out with each other whenever you feel like it on a near-daily basis. I encourage you to be creative and imaginative in figuring out what your ideal relationship looks like when you accept that her boundaries are enforced and not up for negotiation. 

Third, while I think it's totally fair if you choose to bring this up with your friend, I encourage you to be as self sufficient as possible. Personally, I know that my emotions have a tendency to get so big that it eclipses others, and it's not fair for the people around me. It's clear your friend needs some emotional support right now, so putting another interpersonal issue on her plate feels like it *may* be a non-empathetic BPD moment, though I really can't say without knowing you/your friend. Just based on personal experience, I might approach this with a solution on hand and de-emphasize your issues e.g. ""Hey, I miss you a lot! I know you want space, but is it ok if we grab coffee once a week/month/[insert what feels reasonable here]? I'll leave it up to you to reach out to me all other times but I'd love to keep up our friendship in the meantime!"" Or if you feel like your struggles are manageable, I'd not mention you're struggling at all and simply do what you need to do to feel better e.g. spend lots of time with other friends and lean on them, minimize contact with this friend, etc. Part of friendship is learning when to prioritize your friends feelings and realize that everyone takes on a little suffering/sacrifice for the people they care about. Of course this is just coming from my background of failed friendships/learning how to be giving, so if you don't have these issues of dumping big emotions on your friends, I think it's fair to ignore this part of my advice :)

I hope that some part of this was helpful! I hope you feel better soon, and your friends make up their mind soon lol. Sending loving kindness!"	Echidna_Intelligent	reply	na	na	na	0.9946618676185608	strong	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"This might sound like a silly question, but I'm coming from 10+ months of cbt into dbt so I understand a lot of the skills theoretically. I noticed last night while having an introspective mental breakdown that I am struggling with applying it. A lot of what I am doing is self-led. I do have a counsellor that's through a free service, but she is only trained in cbt and an hour a week or two isn't helping. I am trialling a DBT coach to track what skills I am using but I'm noticing that I am struggling to use them. The approach I'm trying to take is to look at them as habits I need to build to replace the behaviour that comes with severe depression and anxiety, which the only “official explanation ” is through it is a common thing people with Narcolepsy experience. I also suspect that I have a personality disorder or something that is making this a pattern I go through mentally. 
Are there any tips or suggestions on how I can do this on my own or is it going to be more effective if I look to take my therapy private and find a dbt program locally?

"The most helpful thing I've done to kick myself into gear so to speak was to participate in a DBT therapy  group course. In total it was 9 hours of group therapy and life skills coaching with an hour of individual therapy for 12 weeks. It was very intensive, and I was in the lucky position to afford the time to focus entirely on the time spent in therapy and practicing skills application, though many of my group were also working through more difficult life situations.

  
Now, that was what worked for me. There are doctors that run regular DBT groups outside of the intensive model, and if you are even remotely close to a reasonably-sized town I imagine that there would be such a group, hopefully accepting new members. I have not investigated myself but it stands to reason such groups may also exist in an online format.

  
There are also DBT Workbooks available at most bookstores and online; the one I have used was titled The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook, and it looks like its on amazon right now. I will say, it worked best as an augmentation to regular therapy, though folks have used only the book and self-taught.

  
The major point I would disagree with for being self-taught entirely is that for myself, obviously I know which skills help keep me present and workable in my own mind, but I have benefitted from having a knowledgeable professional to help check me and my progress from an outsiders perspective.

  
I will say, give yourself the grace and patience you deserve. Taking the time to work on yourself and become more the person you want to be is an admirable pursuit, and one that many many people do not take seriously enough. To me, you asking for advice is proof that you're in it for the long haul.

  
Considering that, you are just now coming into the DBT framework. It's similar to but not identical to CBT, and there will be a bit of an adaptation period to get used to a different sort of therapy and outlook, and then more time to truly rehabitualize new behaviors.

DBT skills usually take large amounts of practice to learn to apply effectively. At least that's how I feel about my own DBT skills/skill application. Being present in the moment, learning how and when to decrease mood intensity, Ect. It takes time. As hard as it is, learning to be patient with the DBT skills gained and practiced is where I would try to start. Journaling your thoughts, Action Urges, Mindfulness process/techniques, Wise Mind usage, Ect. Might help you be more patient because your brain will be occupied. Might help to decrease ruminations to some extent too. You are not alone! I hope this comment helps you in some way that is effective for you.	tucktuck101	reply	na	na	na	0.9986144304275513	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"I've been working on myself with the help of a DBT workbook, and I've put many other things in my life on hold until I gain some stability as things have been very rough for me for the past several months (although I must also mention that I have struggled with hypersensitivity, social anxiety, avoidant behavior, depression, sabotaging myself etc. for more than 15 years).

I've finished the distress tolerance and mindfulness chapters and I can say that I definitely see improvement. I never realized, before starting this therapy, how often and how much I've been cruel to myself, how often I have had negative judgments. Wise mind helps me tremendously in dealing with anxiety about future events, and beginner's mind helps me in times when I need to do something which has been clouded by past bad experiences. Integrating compassion, kindness and empathy, helps both before dealing with certain people, but also afterward to a certain degree, if something ends up upsetting me.

I'm working with the book slowly and thoroughly, and as I'm only at the beginning of the emotion regulation chapter, and I didn't even touch the interpersonal effectiveness chapter, I'm worried about leaping into much more challenging social situations and encountering family, friends and acquaintances who have known the version of me prior to the start of therapy. I realize that I need to expose myself to challenging situations in order to grow, but I'm afraid if it goes horribly wrong, I will end up in a worse state than before starting therapy? How did you deal with similar situations? Have you ever had a significant setback to your progress because you tried to do too much too soon?"	fishpaprikash	post	32.63933873586721	male	White	0.0014960134867578745	na	na	na	8	dbtselfhelp
"First of all, it sounds like this is going great so far, so congratulations! I'm so glad that you've gained introspection and a new peace of mind. 

Second, if you can, I highly recommend a DBT therapist--interpersonal relationships can be more difficult than your relationship with yourself, and I think having someone to talk to as you navigate these relationships will be really helpful for you. 

I'm not exactly sure what you mean by ""too much too soon,"" because it sounds like everything you're doing is working so far, but I think that perhaps you mean that your loved ones will not be receptive to the ways in which you've changed? In which case, I think the interpersonal effectiveness module will help a lot in deciding which relationships to keep/end, as well as DEAR MAN, GIVE FAST, which will allow you to stick to your new values, draw boundaries, and provide some grace on your end while you wait for others to adjust to a new kind of relationship. I think skills that are also frequent for interpersonal situations are check the facts (am I assuming the worst of the other person somehow?), nonjudgmentalness, and dialectics (they are trying their best, but they can also be better, and so can I). 

Finally, I know this sounds scary, but I would cope ahead to the possibility of regressing, and also try radically accepting the dialectics that life has highs and lows on a recurring cycle. You can prepare yourself in every way for your life to be perfect from here on out, but that will not stop life from going into another low. All you can do is prepare yourself now, which you are doing beautifully by learning DBT skills. Keeping in mind that you can't change others, only yourself, I'd cope ahead to what possible dysregulating factors you see ahead of you, and prepare for those as best you can, radically accepting that suffering is an inevitable part of life (sometimes). 

I hope some of this was useful. Best of luck!"	fishpaprikash	reply	na	na	na	0.0014960134867578745	strong	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"I feel like I can relate to your position. I'm also working through a DBT workbook as well as reading a book on trauma. I was recommended DBT therapy last month by my new psychologist. I've been busy absorbing as much as I can about it (for free, on my own) since then. There's a lot to learn and think about, and I've been feeling very overwhelmed. I plan to attend therapy once I'm ready... but i don't feel ready yet.

I do feel a little ashamed that I'm not ready yet. From the workbook, I know the shame isn't justified because it's alright that healing takes longer than you expected. I just have to promise myself that I won't put it off forever (because then I would have something to be ashamed about LOL!)."	fishpaprikash	reply	na	na	na	0.0014960134867578745	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Thank you. It is nice to get some feedback after doing things alone for so long. The problem is that in my country, DBT isn't very popular, but after doing a bit of research I found one therapist that does DBT; not in my city, but she does online sessions as well, so I might look into this option.

By ""too much too soon"" I mean socially more demanding events like wedding receptions and similar. Going alone to events like that, with social anxiety and not really knowing anyone too closely, seems like a nightmare at the moment, but I want to be able to do it. 

I've looked a bit at the techniques you mentioned, and it seems helpful and interesting, but now comes the dilemma of whether I should skip emotion regulation and go straight into interpersonal effectiveness or do the things in the order stated in the book. Some of the emotion regulation exercises span across several weeks, so I won't be ready fast enough, and I'm just putting additional pressure on myself, which doesn't seem like a good idea. 

Now, as I'm writing all of this, I see how far I still am from the concept of radical acceptance. Because all of this is just me battling in advance with the possibility that I will have a bad time at a social event.

"Yes, it can definitely feel overwhelming. There is a lot to do and cover. I think if I took the number of pages I've done and divide it by the number of days I'm working on it so far, it would turn out that I'm doing less than one page per day. xD It is necessary to do some exercises for days or weeks and that slows the whole thing down, but I hope the end result will be stronger if I do things thoroughly. 

For me personally, it helps that I've definitely decided that I will go through the whole book, no matter how long it takes. Sometimes I am frustrated by the slow pace of the process, but I just try to remind myself that this is literally necessary for my survival in the long term. 

I don't think anyone here should feel shame, as we're trying to change. However, I still feel it, especially when I think about how I've treated myself and other people in the past, but that is something I'm trying to accept, change and not repeat as much going forward."	fishpaprikash	follow-up	na	na	na	0.0014960134867578745	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Honestly, even if it's not DBT, a therapist might be nice, just so someone can be your emotional supporter. When I got out of my intensive DBT program, I switched to a psychodynamic therapist because it was really repetitive to just do DBT all the time. So you may find it useful to have a non-DBT therapist as well.

It seems I misunderstood you by ""too much too soon""; sorry about that! Is there any reason you need to jump into events that overwhelming? Why not start out by going to a smaller event where you know a lot of people? Or even doing something lower stakes like a volunteering event? I have a lot of social anxiety but I found that volunteering is nice because people tend to be really nice to one another. I think it may be useful to break it into baby steps instead of jumping from 10 to 100.

I definitely agree with you that radical acceptance is one of the hardest skills out there--you think you got it, and then life beats you down again and you realize there's a lot more for you to learn. Sorry I mentioned all the interpersonal skills; I thought that you were having interpersonal problems, but it sounds like it may be closer to social anxiety rather than actual problems with specific people. I think it's great that you found a speed that works for you and I'm sorry if I put any pressure to speed up!

"It may happen! There's no doubt about it! However all you can really do is learn to accept reality as it is. Even the sucky parts. DBT doesn't teach us that negative emotions and things dont happen. Its not a magical happiness therapy.

That said, DBT teaches you how to ride out those bad things. How to accept reality for when we cant change things, and strategies for changing your reality with what you can do.

This makes things sound kind of bleak. However you're likely to find that practicing DBT and applying the skills and really living it will result in a much better life. You may even find happiness. This does NOT come easy. Its a long arduous process. Takes at least a year of applying skills to really start reaping the benefits.

I had a lot of trouble learning the skills and putting faith in DBT in the beginning. My therapist recommended I read Marsh Linehan's autobiography, Building a Life Worth Living, about her life and how and why she started DBT. It really helped it to click and made me willing to do the work.

"You say you don't want to die from emotional pain that leads to suicide. That's great because it means you have the drive and desire to live through the tough moments in life. 

The skills I would use to prepare for the day when you inevitably do feel deep pain - and it will happen because no one lives forever - are Cope Ahead and Radical Acceptance. 

First, accept reality and stop fighting against it. One day you and your loved ones will die. That is just the reality of life. So instead on filling your short time on earth with fear of the inevitable instead spend your time just experiencing life. Inability to accept reality adds Suffering to Pain. Life is full of joyous and painful moments but you don't need to suffer unnecessarily. The time to grieve is when you have suffered loss, not before the loss has occurred. 

Second, Cope Ahead. When you start to ruminate and catastrophise, imagining the worst case scenario and you crumbling under the weight INSTEAD imagine yourself coping with the situation and surviving it. 
Eg: I would often ruminate on a fear of being trapped in a house fire. When I would start ruminating on that I would interrupt the rumination by imagining the worst thing happening - me being burned, my family dying etc. I'd imagine myself mourning in a healthy way, going to rehab to learn to deal with my injuries, using my DBT skills to manage the pain and suffering I felt and finally finding a life worth living on the other side of my worst fear coming true. 

The fact is, maybe the things you fear will happen and it will be painful and difficult but you have the power inside you to grow through the pain. Cope Ahead helps break the cycle of panic. I usually finish my Cope Ahead skill by speaking directly to my anxiety and saying ""thank you for trying to keep me safe by warning me of dangers, I have coped Ahead of time and don't need you to warn me any more"""		reply	na	na	na	0.9942736029624939	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

I find deep breathing is helpful, and not a cure all. It can help to differing degrees relax the tension in my body. As well as help with negative and anxiety provoking ruminations. If it's a real bad time with my symptoms, I need to practice deep breathing throughout the day. Self-awareness is important for me to know when I need to use deep breathing. Deep breathing helps me get through panic attacks too! The panic attacks still suck, and the Deep breathing helps me to get through them. This is my experience, and I hope it might help you.

"1. You get out what you put in. Practising the skills when you're in the class and supported by your facilitator is much easier than trying to remember them and use them effectively when you're in a crisis/emotionally heightened moment 

2. Make the skills work for you. Do what is effective for you (actually effective, not whats easy) 

3. Give yourself time! Some skills may not make total sense until you learn another. Some skills may not come into focus until you've learned Radical Acceptance for example. Don't panic if something doesn't feel immediately like it clicks. 

4. Use your supports! Talk to your facilitator! If you have one on one coaching offered to you, take it. This is your opportunity to build the life you want and you deserve that life!"	FingerRuler	reply	na	na	na	0.0014112007338553667	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Congrats on taking this step, that’s honestly great!!

My advice is as simple as it is hard: be patient. Be patient with yourself and be patient with the programme. You will learn a lot of different skills but just knowing them won’t help you: you have to practice and keep practicing. 

It can sometimes be frustrating but look at it as training for a marathon. Just knowing how to run won’t get you there, you have to get out there and train. 

There will be good days where you feel very _skillful_ and there will be bad days where you will fall back into your old patterns and feel like giving up. The important thing is to pick yourself back up and keep showing up for yourself.

"Here's what I wish I had done when I started DBT:

1. Take time to write down what your goals/focus areas are.  Be clear with yourself and your individual therapist on these as well as your ""target behavior"" (DBT talk for part of the reason you're there, whether it's related to self-harming/SI, eating disorder, etc.  Mine is more subtle, mainly avoiding and resisting, so I wish I had taken the time to get clear on what I was focusing on instead of just ""I'm miserable and want help"".
2. Commit to the time.  Show up on time every week, with space in your day/mind to really engage.  Schedule time to do the homework.  If something comes up, REschedule the time to do the homework.  (Homework is usually only 10 or 15 min of active writing about your experience practicing the skills.)
3. Realize that it's more like a class than ""group therapy"".  At least that's the way it's been in the two groups (within the same practice) that I've been in.
4. Participate, ask questions, get clarification - make that therapist leading the group do their job.
5. Don't be ashamed about doing group therapy.  Consider being open about it in your life.  I've found so much support from my family, friends, and coworkers by doing so, AND have had good discussions with some on what I'm learning that both helped me integrate the content to my life and seemed to help the other person.
6. If the therapist leading the group doesn't seem like a good fit for you, inquire if you can change groups.  Many practices have multiple groups.  You might have to wait a few weeks, but a different perspective is worth it.
7. Listen for the nuggets from people who are more senior in the group.  I've found a lot of the best insights into myself come from them rather than the therapist leading the group.
8. Make a flash card or similar for yourself to refer to during the week to really learn the mechanics of the skill.  The subtleties of the skill and using it in your life takes a little longer, but you can at least get the framework of the skill down.
9. The workbook is available online as a free PDF, but consider buying the spiral bound version.  (It is expensive, like $60, I think.)  Or print out the pages so you can take notes, fill in the exercises, etc., especially if you are not attending in person or they don't give handouts in class.
10. Be patient with yourself AND hold yourself accountable. 
   1.  One of the first things you learn is that not having these skills is not your fault because most of us never were taught them and many of us grew up in environments in which these skills were not frequently seen.
   2. A lot of the skills will feel like common sense that you never thought of.  That's OK, you're learning them now.
   3. You know now that it's time to learn and use the skills, so commit to yourself that you will.
11. Focus on the DBT that you're doing and don't try to take on other therapies or big self-help activities.  My therapist recommended a book based on DBT for me to use, but I wish I had waited until I was done with the year of DBT and used it as a resource for living it after graduation.  I also wanted to start EMDR, but she cautioned me to slow down and do the one thing (DBT) first and then move on to the next.  I'm glad I did.
12. Reach out for support as you need it to groups like this and other positive, supportive, healthy resources.

Good luck.  I can tell you that it really helps, and it can be a difficult journey.  However, I found it to be a more worthwhile difficult journey than the misery I was living in before DBT."	FingerRuler	reply	na	na	na	0.0014112007338553667	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Oh my god, this is the first time someone has checked in. That really means a lot to me. Feel free to take this to DMs if that’s something you’re willing to do.

I’ve been up and down. Both have been extreme. I am still talking with the program director to get everything organized for me to start DBT. Turns out that the full year commitment will cost almost 10k (includes group, 1on1 and evening/weekend phone calls). It’s the only fully certified program in western Canada so they are able to charge a lot. I’m hoping to start in the next couple weeks, but in the meantime everything has been pretty overwhelming. I’m lucky that I’ve saved loans and grants from school so I think I can afford it.

I’m trying to do all the things people suggest to stay busy but some days are way harder than others. I’ve also been way more impulsive lately which also takes its toll (silly tattoos, dropping one school program for another, quitting one job to pursue a different career, anything to feel different I guess)

Some days are good, tho. I have a few things going on every week that make me feel positive so that’s better than it could be. Ive been trying to regain my creative drive as well. 

I’ve been studying the skills for DBT as much as I can before I start the program so that I’m more prepared to learn it all. Your advice has been very helpful so far. I feel much more organized than usual.

I’m sure there’s more for me to say but I think that’s the gist of it.

Again, I really appreciate that you checked in with me, that really does mean a lot. Thank you. 

I hope you’re doing well. I’d love to hear about you so that this isn’t so one-sided 🙂 Anything you’re willing to share would be really cool!"	FingerRuler	follow-up	na	na	na	0.0014112007338553667	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"I have bpd and during a dbt session we talked about clarifying priorities and it got me thinking a lot. For a long time I didn’t know I was sick and would just end relationships left and right with no remorse or much afterthought. Now I understand it wasn’t healthy. As im still in recovery I still don’t have all the skills I need to navigate relationships in a mindful and less damaging way, it has gotten a LOT better but I still struggle with some things like when to know if I should end a friendship.  Are there any skills that could help with that? My biggest concern when it comes to my judgement of friendships is that I still experience a lot of black and white thinking and I don’t always know when im splitting and when im being fully rational. 

I’ve also never quite understood the balance in friendships. What CAN you demand from a friendship? What is the bare minimum and what isn’t? And what is rational to expect in a friendship? 

If you guys have any suggestions on skills or other resources they are very welcomed. 

Also I will bring this up in dbt as well."	burner878685	post	16.320308356994182	female	White	0.0037781870923936367	na	na	na	16	dbtselfhelp
"You can't expect them to give you unconditional validation. You can't use them to prop up your self esteem.

You can't cut them off just because they aren't perfect. (Or expect them to 'prove' themselves to you.)

You have to respect *their* needs and idiosyncrasies too.

You can't just end a friendship because they kindly call out your bad behavior.  Because the best friends **care** enough do exactly that. It's how we grow and get better.

Lose the ""if you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best"" mindset. That's not healthy.

"I struggle with this a lot too, though I’m not diagnosed with BPD— so what I have to say may not fully relate or internalize, which is okay. 

I think with friendships, what i’ve learned is that forgiveness is okay & important. You may not want someone in your life at that moment, and that’s okay, but someone making one mistake or making one rude comment is truly not enough to abandon them. Which is really what it is, a fear of abandonment surfacing and, to avoid feeling it, abandoning them first. I’m sure you’ve already talked about REST in dbt, but it’s very important. No matter what, with any emotionally backed decision, you should take a couple of days to sit on it and think. Any time you feel yourself getting angry or hurt or upset you just need to communicate how you feel and walk away from the situation until you can have a calm discussion with whoever hurt you, even if all you feel like doing is fighting them. Just don’t give in to that impulse. 

I think I had to ask myself quite recently: would I rather be lonely and have nobody around or some hurt feelings sometimes? And i’d rather bare the hurt feelings. People are human and make mistakes and treat others poorly on accident in the same way you and I might. I’d always hope others give me second chances and forgiveness, so i have to extend that same kindness to others, even if it may not be returned. 

I think there’s a natural way a friendship ends in which you two just grow apart. The only thing bonding you anymore is old memories, and both of you are so different that you both look at each others decisions with pity and judgement, or feel like you have absolutely nothing in common to talk about— like there’s a fundamental disconnect. Usually both parties feel it and the friendship turns from regular best friends to someone you communicate with maybe a few times a year or never. 

Then there’s the second way a friendship ends, which is probably more what you’re talking about: a huge falling out. It’s normal, but can be managed. This is when you stop talking to a friend for these reasons:

- There is a strong, succinct pattern in behavior you have been putting up with for quite a long time that is actively disrespectful to you, your loved ones, your time or your firmly placed values.

- They are aggressive, verbally abusive, manipulative, or treat people or animals poorly. 

One time events are not enough, at least for someone with BPD who struggles with relationships. Most neurotypical people are far more forgiving, though of course there are exceptions. Even still, those patterned behaviors are something you split from calmly and walk away from. It’s almost never something you should have a huge argument about. I still cringe thinking about massive blowout fights I had with long term friends over stupid things that led me to completely excommunicating with them. It hurts all sides and while it might feel temporarily good, it’ll feel terrible for far, far, far longer. DBT therapy is good for managing that initial impulse. 

There’s nothing more powerful and helpful than saying “This conversation is really starting to upset me and I don’t want to escalate it, so i’m going to walk away until I’m calmed down and we can discuss this in a mature way.” I’ve saved so many friendships now I later realized i didn’t want to lose from this. 

Anyways hope this helped, sorry for the absolute wall of text."	burner878685	reply	na	na	na	0.0037781870923936367	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Have you done much work on Values 

Knowing what your values are, and what kind of relationships you value might be a good place to start with this. 
The first thing to remember is that there are no good or bad values. Everyone's values are different, they are just like guiding lights for creating the life you want and the relationships you want. 

For example: Maybe you have a friend who is always cancelling on you at the last minute and who regularly forgets to do things they said they would do. If you value Reliability and Consideration then maybe this isn't a friendship that is fulfilling for you or for them. 
On the other hand, maybe you value Forgiveness and Loyalty much more than Reliability and Consideration. Then maybe you can learn to Radically Accept this friendship as it is. 

Now, whether to cut the friendship off entirely is the next question. 
You said you have trouble recognising if you're splitting so I would do a Pros and Cons list on this as a first step. 
Maybe your friend always cancels on you last minute however they are a friend you can always call to talk to whenever you are down. They are not reliable but they are very supportive and kind. 
If you cut them off you will lose that support. Listing out all the pros and cons for a situation will help you to see if you are splitting. 

The next step is to problem solve. Write down all the things you could do OTHER than just cut them off. 
Maybe you can speak to them about what's frustrating you and try to negotiate the conflict, maybe you can stop asking the friend to hang out and instead only speak over the phone, maybe you can take a two week break from the friend, etc.

"Oh, and as far as what to expect from friendships: you should expect about 25% of what you give. It’ll feel like that to both sides, so avoid feeling like you’re being totally taken advantage of or you’re hated. 

Example: you buy a friend two gifts, expect none or at best, one down the line. You provide emotional support 4 times during a hard time, expect to receive emotional support back maybe once when you’re going through it. Or maybe it’s not quite so 1:1, you provide emotional support and someone buys you a gift. Doesn’t matter the price tag, it’s all about thought and energy behind it. For example I got into an argument with a friend recently and he bought me cookies and apologized. I was so pissed at him and ready to fight him, but after cooling off for a few days I realized he was someone I wanted to keep in my life. I’m not trying to make it sound like relationships are all so transactional, but that friendships are built on love and support for one another- but I think someone with BPD will struggle to feel loved, and has to look at the evidence anecdotally."	burner878685	reply	na	na	na	0.0037781870923936367	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

Ohhh! Yeah that is different. Maybe refresh on your boundaries tied in also with what your values are. If the relationship crosses you boundaries and/or your values. Probably not healthy if it's already happened multiple times. Also, if the other person in the relationship you have tried to convey to them how your boundaries and/or your values are, then they still invalidate those boundaries and/or values. Might be time to take a break or end the relationship. Do what is healthy for you in relationships long term. Lots of identifying of different aspects of DBT, mixed with self-awareness.

I’ve just finished the first round of a DBT program (where we complete all modules twice) and I’ve started to realise that when I was particularly unwell in depressive episodes/bipolar lows, I think I did not give informed consent for treatments. I had ECT and while I did technically consent, I was too unwell to know what was going on. I was made to feel helpless and was reliant on others completely. I want to accept this and move forward with it, but it still just carried this hurt and sadness. I’m unsure how to practically use radical acceptance for this. Any advice would be appreciated.

"Radical acceptance is hard to do when it comes to past experiences…I still struggle with accepting the past from time to time, especially when my experiences of it are invalidated. I think the best way to “accept” it is to acknowledge that it did happen when the thought enters your mind. Practice self compassion and validate the emotions. Acknowledge that you would change it IF you could. Then let the thought go and maybe use a different skill to do so. Radical Acceptance doesn’t mean it has to be a one off thing. I think of it as you continue to accept something, which can get easier with time. 

With the pain from it, it can be useful to get a pencil and paper/ keyboard and screen (whatever is effective for you) and just let it out free writing style. Pain will always be a temporary thing and the more you fixate on the pain, the more you might re-live the pain again and again."

"I can definitely relate to this. I received ECT while at an inpatient facility in my early twenties, and it was truly a terrible experience. Looking back, they made it seem like a magic cure all for my years of depression and anxiety. It was irresponsible of them to allow me to make that decision when I was in distress and without properly informing me of what to expect during and after treatment.

I felt a lot of anger and resentment towards the facility. It took some time, distance and talking about my experience with therapists and my family to even realize that I felt taken advantage of. Talking and writing about it definitely helped with validating my feelings and processing the trauma.

As terrible as some of the things I’ve gone through are, my experiences have made me so much more compassionate and understanding of others. That is something that I hold onto when I find myself slipping into the “why me” spiral of thoughts.

You went through something traumatic, and unfortunately those experiences take a while to accept. Trying to force yourself to move on can make things more difficult to process. You might find a technique like [riding the wave](https://dbtselfhelp.com/dbt-skills-list/emotion-regulation/ride-the-wave/?amp) to be helpful when those feelings of hurt and sadness arrive."

"Echoing to say TIPP, but also:

One of the things that came up in my last participatory group was the idea of a distraction tool kit, actualized into a literal box of known distraction items (fiddlybits, books, video games, that one youtube video that splits your sides laughing).

The extension from there is a blend of that physical item, and associating interaction with it as a calm behaviour. That was one thing we determined was that distraction and self-soothing techniques work best when practiced, and are best practiced while calm to associate the feel of that state of mind with using your tool kid. Nothing wrong with a little self-optioned Pavlovian training if it works, right?

Nothing to feel bad about with the head medicine, either, though I feel I understand where you're coming from on that. I learned a long time ago to treat medication for mental health not as a cane or crutch, but as one would glasses - only fools give people shit for wearing glasses anymore, and it's a logical process that leads to wearing them: ""I don't see good > Optometrist > Glasses >  See good."" Head medicine is glasses for your brain.

A good general thing to do as well is modifying your self-talk or internal dialogue for kindness. Angry is okay, feeling stupid is okay, but don't tell yourself that. Apologies for the heavyhandedness of that statement, but in the same way that we are affected by our surroundings and the people we spend time with, we are affected by what and how we speak with ourselves.

"I would check out the skill ""radical acceptance"" and follow it step by step.

Just some notes to bare in mind with radical acceptance:

-it doesn't guarantee forgiveness, or a good relationship. It simply means accepting the reality of what has happened (the facts), and the emotions that come with that.

-it is a skill that often needs to be repeated again and again and again, especially for very challenging things that are difficult to accept.

-it takes time for the skill to work, and can be a physically tiring experience, and can involve feeling unpleasant emotions such as anger and sadness.

-radical acceptance is not passivity, resignation, or liking something or agreeing with it. It does not mean ignoring it and doing nothing to change it.

Also it's not DBT but Pete Walker (who you should read) talks about the importance of healthy ""angering"" and healthy ""blaming"" to vent and process anger at parents who mistreated us.

Radical acceptance is another tool here - it doens't mean acceptance like ""now it's all okay"" but rather is the opposite of denial. Accepting that reality is reality instead of arguing against what happened so that you can move forward. 

You do not have to forgive them. You do not have to have a relationship with them. Your first job is to take care of yourself, not them, not your relationship with them. 

In my personal experience, I have had to maintain distance from my parents - not cut off but low-contact - because they will continue to treat me in ways that are harmful (my dad) and with my mom, she is truly sorry but being around her stirs up all those old emotions that are otherwise not on my mind. So it is just not healthy for me to be close with them. I think finding other healthy connections is really crucial to you being able to make free choices about your relationships with them."	gingfreecsisbad	reply	na	na	na	0.9974714517593384	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

Im not sure if its actually called object permanence but the problem is that I have a really good time with friends when Im hanging out, but the moment they leave and Im back home, after a few hours Im back to feeling like they dont like hanging out with me or that they hate me and find my annoying. Im in a constant need of reassurance but with these trust issues I cant even bring myself to trust their reassurance. And then because I keep thinking that they dont like me, I start to feel like they are faking their friendship with me and are tired of me so I split on them and say nasty stuff to them from all the built up anxiety or whatever. The amount of close friendships Ive ruined is too big to count because of this issue.	youngwooki23	post	32.57595459513641	female	White	0.9993122816085815	na	na	na	8	dbtselfhelp
"Thats a really common experience you're having and it's definitely something you can improve. Are you using any skills to help? 

The ones which come to mind first are 
1. Check the facts 
2. Wise mind
3. Opposite action. 

When you find yourself ruminating on this belief that your friends don't like you try checking the facts. Put all your beliefs on trial and list out all the actual solid proof that you have that this belief is true. Make sure to only list true things that you can experience with your 5 senses. So for example 
 'I can just tell from how long it took for them to reply to my texts' isn't proof. That's an assumption. 

When you have the urge to cut them off or speak angrily at them check whether that urge Fits the Facts. Make sure you're checking in Wise Mind and not emotion mind. If you are in emotion mind practice some mindfulness first - particularly remembering Non Judgmental and One Mindful as a skill. 
Then, thibk about your urge and ask what would happen if you did the opposite. Instead of cutting friends off what would happen if you reached out with kindness?"	youngwooki23	reply	na	na	na	0.9993122816085815	weak	no	strong	na	dbtselfhelp

"Are there any DBT skills that I can use to improve ""emotional permanence?"" 

I'm not sure if this is the right word to use, but what I mean by that is if I'm not actively experiencing a positive emotion, it's like I had never experienced it in the first place.  I have said my whole life in response to this (because I assumed everyone experiences this) ""what goes up must come down.""  However, I have observed that emotionally healthy adults do not become incredibly depressed after a really happy experience. They are able to maintain it. 

For example, I look forward to therapy all week because I really like my therapist. He's really nice to me and helps me a lot, but the moment I'm back home, I cry and cry. It's like I never had the time with him in the first place. Or, after my husband and I spend the whole day together, when he goes to play games, I will cry again after he leaves, because I'm so sad to be alone. It's like our whole day together never happened. It makes me feel really guilty, like what I am given is never enough. 

Would expressing gratitude be a skill to help with improving and continuing to feel the positive emotions, even after the event has passed? Are there other skills to use?"	Alainasaurous	post	27.52392059146093	female	White	0.9909989833831787	na	na	na	21	dbtselfhelp
Also mindfulness when you are experiencing positive emotions.

I’m going through something similar at the moment and the biggest thing working for me is doing self care that brings down my stress levels.

I would suggest mediation.  You can start small. Even just a 5 minute break from whatever you're doing, 1 minute if that's all you have, to just focus on something peaceful, like your breathing.  Take some deep breaths, close your eyes if you can (you can attempt to quite the mind even at work and around others, but maybe you can't sit down and close your eyes just then) just focus on something neutral; the weight of gravity in your body, the temperature, a sound. Taking the time to do this without distractions whenever you can, as often as you can, should help a lot. It's okay if the mind wanders,  that's expected. When thoughts come into your mind just accept that, give them the attention they're seeking,  then return your attention to the thing you're choosing to focus on. It's the act of RETURNING focus and breaking that cycle that's important. With practice you will gain more and more control over your thoughts. There's lots of guided meditations available on YouTube and other resources for helping you explore different types of meditations.	walnutmercury	reply	na	na	na	0.9994165897369385	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I’d 100% recommend meditation. This is how I practice mindfulness, such as observing etc.
Headspace has a 4 week meditation course on stress, led by someone who studied it. I can pass on a 30 day code so you can give it a try? 

I’d also look at your basic needs and make sure they are all being met, not just self care. I think this is known as ABC Please? 

When I am the most “volatile”, stress or otherwise, i take a step back from the stressor, I run through a checklist and see what need I haven’t met. 
“Am I thirsty
Am I hungry?
Am I tired? 
Am I…” etc. 

Writing a list and keeping it in your wallet/pocket/phone to refer to could be a way to kick start this.

I’d also pay attention to the things that negatively affect you. I.e addictions, mood altering substances (alcohol, even just one or two standard drinks has a big impact on me right now), other things in your environment that is causing more “obstacles” than helping reduce stress. 
Something that affects me with stress is when I take on others when I am unprepared, so also look at whether the stress is internal (a thought) and/or external (an event is causing me to feel distressed) then decide on a way to deal with the stress. 

One of the most helpful advice I was given for stress was that it is a choice to continue to respond to stress in a distressed manner.

Opposite action is meant to be used if the emotion doesn’t fit the facts, or if acting on the emotion would be ineffective.

"Hi! Sorry to hear you're feeling burnt out.

I wonder if opposite action is the best skill for this situation, or maybe whether other skills are needed.

Opposite action works when you have an emotion that doesn't fit the facts in its quality and intensity, or when you have an urge to do a behaviour that is ineffective.

So first I would ask, what is the emotion(s) that you are feeling in regards to this situation, and what are the action urges you are having? Maybe it would help to spend a bit of time here and be really specific about what behaviour or emotions are actually causing issues here, and what the facts are. 

Maybe you find that you have an emotion that does fit the facts. In which case, you can use the problem solving skill instead of opposite action. I.e. define the problem, what a realistic expectation of solving the problem would be, a list of possible solutions, and pros and cons of the best two.

Or if you have an emotion that doesn't fit the facts or is ineffective, then you can be more specific with your opposite action as you may now have identified the specific urges that are causing issues."	strohwirdgold	reply	na	na	na	0.008344937115907669	strong	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Hi

I was in a DBT program following my inpatient stay. It ended 2 months ago.

I’m stable now and not emotionally distressed, but I feel stuck in moving forward with my goals. 

I have a desire to build mastery and accumulate positives with a lot of self improvement/quality of life goals, mostly regarding my physical and financial health. Accomplishing these goals would contribute to “building a life worth living.”

However, I’m having trouble following through with pursuing these goals. 

I would love to hear experiences of those who’ve used skills to accumulate positives and build mastery in terms of living life the way you desire in order to improve your quality of life and self-confidence. 

The word that comes to mind is discipline, but I wonder if there’s a reframe of that idea in the context of DBT.

"You're correct that all the discipline skills are ABC skills, but honestly, at the worst of my illness, ABC's and the discipline I need to pursue my ABC's is very difficult to access. ABC's are only useful if you have the ability to be disciplined at all. 

I strongly disagree with the idea that discipline is about ignoring your feelings. That only works when you have some modicum of self compassion already, and have the resilience to afford to ignore your feelings. I think that if you're struggling with basic discipline, you're probably struggling with a ton of self hatred. I think that you should learn how to be kind to yourself and face failures in a healthy way so that you don't shame/fear spiral whenever you feel yourself failing whatever goals you set. For example, feeling the need to exercise but not doing it everyday probably makes it less likely for you to do it the next day because it's stressing you out, and you reproach yourself for the failure. If you learn to be okay with your perceived failure and think with optimism instead of pessimism (tomorrow is another day; I missed today's workout but I went on a nice walk, etc; this is a form of dialectics), it's more likely you can face your shame and fear and create the safe space you need to pursue your goals. So ultimately, yes, ABC's and discipline are about a bit of opposite action and facing your unwillingness to work toward your goals, but I suspect that for you, it's a whole lot more about loving kindness, dialectics, and checking the facts to realize you're not as much of a failure as you think you are. 

On a much more practical note, I don't know what your financial goals are but if it's to save, I suggest converting as much of your spending as possible to cash, and setting a weekly budget you withdraw by cash. Spending $5 for coffee or $50 for a clothing piece hurts a lot more if you have to physically hand it over, and it also lets you set a weekly budget--you only have so much cash you've withdrawn for the week, and when you're out, you're out. I assume you're paying your bills but if not, set aside the money you need for your bills the moment you get paid so that you don't touch it. 

Hope this helps! If I'm off the mark about self love I apologize; I could have been relying too much on my personal experiences. Sending loving kindness :)"	beepoelar	reply	na	na	na	0.991435706615448	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

- Do the hard work in the morning, rest in cycles (60min work 10min relax, etc.)
- Show up everyday. (Even for 5 pushups, or make it easier like bycyle. Day by day it will be easier.)
- delete social media, environment noise, make everything boring so the work will be fun
- for discipline: i've created my philosophy around this. I've think about my goal, and do not care about my feelings. When you dont want to do the job it can even feel meaningless and stupid, your ego wants you to stop. Then I say it doesnt matter. I want to do it, and I do what I want. I do not think, I act. Dont overthink. If you do a mistake, you will try in another way, but atleast you are doing something and gain momentum.

"I think accumulating positives is as much about mindfully becoming aware of the small pleasures already in your everyday life as it is about acting on goals. For example, noticing a tree and allowing yourself to feel pleasure at the beauty of it. Or every time you clean up or wash, telling yourself ""good job"". Plenty of self validation. As you accumulate more of these small pleasant events and experience them mindfully, it can help with the motivation to do more difficult tasks that bring you closer to your goals. This may be a bit of an underwhelming response but I think it links back with ""Wise mind: balancing doing and being mind"" and having a dialectical approach to goals. Working on goals, AND letting go of attachment to needing to achieve those goals. Letting yourself focus, and letting yourself just be. 

I also find that I have a much harder time doing anything when my emotions are disregulated. I may not feel distressed, but my mental block against doing something is often linked to an emotion on some way. For example, I wake up late, and I have the thought ""ugh, again, why can't I just get up earlier, I'd get so much more done"". Then I experience shame. The shame has the after effect that I avoid myself and the things I need to do. So until I acknowledge it and let it go, it is like wading through mud. So a bit of opposite action e.g. tell myself ""I woke up late but that's okay, I still have plenty of time today. I'm going to slow down and appreciate the morning"".  This is just an example from my own experience.

Oh and also: the mindfulness how skills. Doing things one mindfully, non judgementally and in particular, effectively. Just doing what is needed, and experiencing the doing with your full awareness (one thing at a time!) and just non judgementally observing each moment. I find this can help a lot with having more realistic expectations about your goals and being more flexible when things don't go to plan. Like I don't need to clean the whole kitchen, it's effective to just wipe down the sides, and I can do that mindfully and then move on to the next thing"	beepoelar	reply	na	na	na	0.991435706615448	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I feel like a broken record but I’m sensing a lack of here-and-now mindfulness in how you describe the issue. Also maybe some self-compassion in that you’re basically a DBT newborn, give yourself some time to practice! You’re learning how it feels to live this new life, where your new values and priorities are. Rome wasn’t built in a day!

I think things started clicking for me when I stopped managing the past and future simultaneously and focused on today. There’s also an element of routine that KC Davis on tiktok does a better job of outlining. My day to day is like 60% PLEASE skills and on workdays, 40% work, weekends, 40% ABC skills. There’s some element of ABC mixed with my PLEASE tasks though - I enjoy cooking so I cook every single meal nearly from scratch, meal plan new veggies and flavors, etc. Hiking is a favorite exercise that takes skill and focus. Also, I have a dog and love seeing her happy on a good walk. I’m into reuse/upcycling so that’s a mastery-building way to solve everyday needs. All that being said, I don’t think I’m doing anything different or more than the day before. But when I look back, wow, my life is so much richer. It’s mostly taking what I do everyday and putting a tiny challenge on top. A lot of that has to do with emotional capacity though. When I’m overwhelmed, it’s right into distress tolerance with little forced blips of extra tiny challenges. But it passes, the storms get less frequent.

I heard some advice once about how to learn to budget, and I think it applies to behavioral activation or any behavior change: If you’re spending $500 a month on whatever and you want to spend less, set your budget next month for $500. Be mindful of how that $500 gets spent. But no pressure, the budgets the same as before. How did it feel when you spent it? Was it lasting or brief? Often, you’ll find that the mindfulness leads to reduced spending - and with more data, you can make future changes that are meaningful, important, and don’t shock your system.

"Through practice, have any of your DBT skills become automatic, where you just use them without even really thinking about it anymore? 

I have radically accepted that I am always going to have big emotions and feel them deeply, so I know that I'm always going to need to use skills to manage them effectively. As another kind redditor on this sub pointed out to me yesterday, we are re-wiring our brains with DBT. This got me thinking about how we form habits and had me wondering what other's experience has been like with using skills without having to think about them much anymore. For example, when I need to use STOP, I have to go step by step. It takes a lot of focus and energy. I am committed to whatever it takes to continue to act skillfully, but I would be curious to know from any of you what your experience has been like with using skills for a long time and if they become more automatic.

"Deep breathing can be automatic. Usually from interpersonal conflicts with family. Definitely noticable now when my anger is high intensity regarding those situations. Opposite Action is on the verge of being automatic. Not yet, and has become a reflex to consider doing Opposite Action, not to due automatically without intentional thinking first. Validating others purposely, and genuinely has helped my interpersonal relationships. For both family and friends. I would like that to become automatic. It's not automatic. The fact that I think to use validation for others is an improvement in itself. It does take Mindfulness to allow me to be Self-aware enough to see Validation opportunities when those opportunities are Present.

Geez, I could go on and on. DBT is so helpful/effective in my life. Nobody ever is completely done with DBT practice. Skill usage and Willingness while combating Willfulness will always need some practice. Even if DBT skills are practiced, some may not become automatic. Intentional skill usage versus automatic skill usage. Both can be effective. So, if it can't in the present be an automatic skill. Intentional usage may feel/be harder, and is still effective."

"It's been almost seven years since I did my DBT program and yeah, it's instinctual. The first three or so months I couldn't ever figure out how to apply the skills in the moment. Then for the year after that I had to work REALLY hard at my skills. For two or so years after that, I had to deliberately do them. Then I slowly phased out the conscious effort and now I really have to sit down to think about what behaviors I did that were DBT informed. It just happens.

A common model of learning is unconscious incompetence - conscious incompetence - conscious competence - unconscious competence. It sounds like you're at the beginning of the conscious competence phase with some skills which is great! Imo it's where things finally start feeling better. The most you practice it, the more they're ingrained.

Hi.  This makes sense to me, although I am far too new in my DBT journey to have internalised techniques as you describe.  Your post reminded me of neuroplasticity which refers to the way we 'rewire' our brains over time in the way you describe.  Ruby Wax writes about it in her books.

"Yeah, definitely. STOP is a big one for me. When I feel those big emotions coming on, I instinctively take a pause before reacting much of the time (although not every time but I can't remember the last time I had a big overreaction). 

I feel like opposite action is becoming more second nature for me, too. Often I'll need to consciously practice it and then there are other times I notice an urge and just know to do the opposite without needing to give it any thought because I know the action urge isn't effective.

I still consciously practice every day and I feel like the practicing on its own seems automatic. I'm much more mindful than I've ever been and that helps me stay in touch with my emotions.

In fact, it's interesting that the only moments I usually have issues with emotional regulation at this point in my life is when I'm very tired(like tired enough to compromise my thinking), on sleep aids like Zzzquil, or after I've been drinking a bit. 

What's interesting is that during the times when my mind is compromised and isn't as quick, are the moments that my emotional disregulation slip through the cracks, where I can become more angry and emotional.

"Ooo I never thought of DEARMAN like that. Explains why it’s such a tough one! Thanks for that perspective.

I have absolutely had those moments. One fairly recently triggered by very intense stress in every part of my life. What I needed to do was have a cold shower, do some self soothing and leave my phone alone. Instead I ignored all that and called someone, creating further issues in our already issue filled situationship. It has ended, and tbh…it needed to. That was kinda the catalyst to finally let go. For us both. Luckily we’re still friends because we didn’t let things get to the point where they were really bad. Maybe my break down helped ensure that didn’t happen? Who knows…

But yeah… def a recent moment that I reached my skills breakdown point. 

But lately when applying STOP to school, it’s been really helped and I have yet to be wilful with it. I’m using it mostly in moments where in the past a tough math question would have made me cry, now (due to DBT practice, but also due to some stuff I learned about neiroplasticity) I am able to push through and hardly even get upset! I wrote a financial accounting midterm today…and had zero panic moments. A few moments where I had to choose to be effective by going slowly and thinking through each problem slowly. But almost zero distress.

"Yeah, I think the main one for me is doing check the facts again and again and again. Sometimes it feels tedious but when I am able to check my interpretations against the facts and come up with more likely interpretations, it does help me have more trust in myself. Sometimes when I check the facts I do doubt myself, but I think, if I'm not sure if my emotions fit the facts, that's still more helpful than assuming they do, and even if I'm not sure, I can just be extra mindful about my actions anyway. Also validating my emotions even if they don't fit the facts. That really helps me calm down. Saying to myself like ""hey, I understand why you're angry. It's not effective to stay angry, but it's okay that you are right now"".

Also learning to notice when I don't have all the facts and just feeling the uncertainty of it and trying to learn to be okay with that. Sometimes when I do check the facts it's just a whole lot of ""I don't know, so I'm going to err on the side of caution""

I think a big self-trust thing has come from learning about urge-surfing. If I have an urge that I have to do something right now and it's really important, I'm probably in emotion mind. Sometimes I tell myself ""if it's really that important for me to say that thing, I can say it tomorrow. So I'm going to make myself wait and I'll say it tomorrow"". Then usually the next day I'm like, omg, I'm so glad I never said that thing.

"   Several days ago I was in a plane that came very close to crashing. The turbulence was horrific, the emergency lights were going off, and there was just silence from the airline crew as they frantically tried to fix the situation and/or just hold onto their posts. The pilot later told us the barometric pressure was the lowest he’d seen in his whole career. People were screaming and vomiting in fear. I was attempting to text my family that I loved them in case I didn’t survive the crash. We came so close to the ground those texts actually sent. My whole body was vibrating in fear and I felt totally helpless. 

The plane didn’t crash, but was redirected 300 miles south and grounded for 12 hours. We were all ok, but I’m struggling with how to process any of this. People are horrified on my behalf, but I feel like I’m struggling with validating myself - after all, other than a few bruises, I came out totally unscathed physically. But my body feels like it’s holding onto that fear. I find myself trembling, sometimes violently and uncontrollably if I’m especially stressed or cold. My throat feels tight and it feels like the ground is moving beneath my feet. 

I would like DBT tips (or any tips, really) on how to process this in a way that hopefully both honors my emotions while soothing the huge fear that I’m feeling, so I can better move on."	drunched	post	21.76811894348982	female	White	0.9936569333076477	na	na	na	16	dbtselfhelp

I would definitely look up CPT worksheets. cpt is a really strong tool for cases like this, because it shows you exactly what thoughts are factual and what's perceptive. Really try to challenge yourself to focus on what happened, and what's currently happening. It's definitely valid to feel the fear you're feeling after such an experience so being able to concretely define what is factual in the situation. I guess to put it in simpler terms, it's a tool to decipher whether your fears are still valid or if they're coming from a place that you can safely move on.

"This may sound really off but studies have shown playing Tetris and/or similar games actually help reduce the instances of intrusive thoughts from a traumatic event. As I kid I was obsessed with these types of games and can't deny the therapeutic effect it had during my traumatic childhood. Maybe it could help you too while you are processing and navigating such a difficult event. I'm so sorry you have to go through this.   


As far as DBT specific skills, I find using guided mediations from CALM's Youtube channel to increase Mindfulness and create purposefully calm spaces of time are incredibly helpful and therapeautic. Leaning into the Distress Tolerance skills (especially self-soothing) will be helpful as well while your mind and body continue to process the trauma you experienced."	drunched	reply	na	na	na	0.9936569333076477	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"I'm laughing because I can relate, not because I'm laughing at you. 

I watched my dad die in a hospital bed. It was a very intense death. Like, fish-on-a-dock flopping around death. Took 3 days. I was haunted by that experience for 3 years. I never got PTSD help because I convinced myself I was fine. Looking back, I was a hot mess. I lost a LOT of friendships from withdrawal. I emotionally abandoned everyone because I was so deeply disturbed. Spent days in bed. Fucked up my life, in some ways permanently. If I went to a traditional PTSD therapist instead of a ""career coach"" for the job symptoms... I would have saved myself years of heartache and probably could have saved many relationships. 

The risk of ruin from untreated PTSD is so great, that you should go even if you don't think you deserve it.

"Getting help for this issue right away can PREVENT ptsd. Google around for the studies they’ve done about how to process traumatic events to avoid ptsd setting in. My understanding is that going through the event in your mind in a safe place can really help. You need to get it out of just your mind. Write down everything you can remember (posting here was some of that for you!). If you’re concerned about anxiety or panic while doing this, have a trusted person next to you. Soft lightning, gentle music, comfy blanket. What you’re trying to do is prevent your brain from connecting your experience to fight or flight. It’s a physical, chemical thing. Think of it like physical therapy after an injury.

If you have any mental health crisis centers in your area, give them a call and see how fast you can be seen by someone. They may also be able to refer you to therapists they know have openings so you don’t have to deal with calling a dozen places just to be on a waitlist. Call your doctor and see about anti anxiety medication if you’re dealing with anxiety coming up regularly. You can take these kinds of meds as little and as short term as you want. 

I hope you can get some dbt specific help from here, but don’t wait to get professional help. And understand that ptsd isn’t a guarantee for everyone that experiences trauma, it’s preventable AND curable for a lot of people with the right therapies. 

That experience sounds awful, I’m sorry you went through that. Focus on self care, take good care of your body and avoid drugs and alcohol for a while while you process this.

"A small background. My mother abused me in the same way throughout my childhood. I have been reliving this trauma since then in a myriad of ways and the last couple of times circumstances triggered those traumas, I have tipped toward self-harm. (I’ve not done anything; it’s more like a mental steam release.)

I went to an IOP program in 2018 which contained a lot of DBT skills. (I’ve been told that they were “modified DBT,” but I don’t know what that means.)

The IOP program was grueling and traumatic itself. Whenever I happen to drive near the building, I feel physically ill. 

Recently this trauma has come up again and, frankly, it’s the worst I’ve ever felt. I am under care (and have been since 16) and a therapist has suggested I go back to IOP to learn the original skills, nothing modified. It would be an entirely different program. 

I have a binder full of materials from back then. I tried to review them today and I feel the same physical illness as I do when driving past the building. 

I have two questions:

1. Does anyone have any tips on how to look at this stuff again without getting sick?

2. I’m in a really bad way right now. I can’t work because the pain from that trauma is looping through my head. I keep eating Xanax so I can stay unconscious but that’s not going to last. (I’m on Seroquel as of tonight.) Can anyone recommend specific skills? TIPP comes to mind, but I’d be going to be going back to the ice cubes every 10 minutes.

"This isn’t exactly a skill, although I think it’s closest to accumulating positive experiences (I think that’s the name of the skill) but it helped me so much to deal with my years long suicidal ideation. Basically, at least once a day, find a time to say to yourself, ‘wow, this is a nice moment’ or ‘wow, I really like [thing you’re noticing in the moment]’. 

Make sure it’s something really tiny at first. I used to notice when the weather was pleasant, or when I had a perfect cup of tea, or when I said something kind to a friend and they were grateful or when they said something kind to me. You could even just do something like a YouTube video or a book you like, or when you see a pretty sunset or flower or many other small things. 

Basically, it just trains you to start noticing the good things in life even when everything is overwhelmingly painful, which means you get a small break from the pain that slowly increases until, like for me, you look back on the suicidality as a painful memory but one that feels entirely foreign to your life now. 

I really commend your strength for reaching out and asking for help with this, because chronic SI really sucks the energy out of you. Doing DBT is not easy but it saved my life and I hope helps you too, and that my comment is useful! Best wishes :)"	EmptyLevel6637	reply	na	na	na	0.6926155686378479	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I think it depends on what you mean by ""chronic suicidal ideation;"" there are different levels to this and I'm not sure if you mean it clinically. You can generally be dreading life and have a general, constant wish to die (mild), have a general plan but also have protective factors (moderate), or have a fully formulated, implemented plan that you're ready to execute at any opportunity and you're simply on the lookout for the right time (chronic). If you mean chronic in the clinical sense, use all the skills in distress tolerance (especially TIPP and STOP) and **PLEASE GET TO A HOSPITAL ASAP.** 

Generally the cause of suicidal ideation is depression, so the skills I would use in mild cases are Loving Kindness, Half Smiling and Willing Hands, Check the Facts (for any cognitive distortion), and Opposite Action to sadness. Remember also to keep up with PLEASE and AB(C). For both mild and moderate suicidal ideation, please consider upping your therapy to 2 or 3x a week. 

In moderate cases, the cognitive distortion is already very strong so all the skills above are probably quite hard to access. In this case, I'd focus on getting through day by day with distress tolerance and as much PLEASE/ABC as you can manage, until you feel that you can engage with the skills listed above. At this stage I would also either up therapy to 3x/week or consider an outpatient day program. 

Overall though, suicidal ideation is very hard for internet strangers to give advice on. In my experience, it's not really something you confront because it's a lack, not something *there*. It's this huge gaping hole that you slowly fill up with love and fulfillment. When you're in deep, there's no light so it's very hard to see anything. You just need to focus on getting out alive--just continuing to breathe and focusing on taking one step out at a time. There's very little you have energy to do when you're in survival mode; hence my recommendation for distress tolerance more than anything. But as you get closer to the surface and more light shines through, it'll become clearer what you can do--ABC's, loving kindness, values and goal making, the connection you make with others. 

Best of luck, OP. Please get professional help (or more of it if you already have some). I am rooting for you and sending you loving kindness. <3"	EmptyLevel6637	reply	na	na	na	0.6926155686378479	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

WISE mind and replacement behaviors are key for me. I try to implement it into my life regularly so that when the urges come, my brain is now trained to think hopefully and more willing. WISE mind helps me keep the cognitive triangle in mind, so that I can trace back and challenge the thoughts that make me want to turn to sh. I’m not sure what sh methods you use, but example replacement behaviors can be a good, pointed, washable marker, or cold showers. You have to make your replacement behaviors personal to you. What is rewarding to you? What is the goal when you sh? What are your triggers? I also like ACCEPTS (Activities, Contributing, Comparisons, Emotions, Pushing Away, Thoughts, Sensations) and DDEADS (Delay/Don’t give in, Escape the triggers, Avoid the trigger or Attack/Accept the urge, Distract with another activity, Substitute for your addictive thinking behaviors)	IDoBeVibing745	reply	na	na	na	0.4754345417022705	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Hi All,

I recently started DBT for some anxiety and some distress tolerance. My therapist is OK. I fill in my diary card via an app - PsychSurveys.

During the session, she opens the diary cards for the first time which I am surprised by because I expect she would read them before the session and come prepared. Instead, I feel she glances through them and picks something at random to work on and also picks one positive thing to talk about but misses important threads. Like today she missed some pretty important stuff.  


What has your experience been with DBT diary cards? Does your therapist read them before the session or do you go over them during the session? Do you feel your T is picking up all the relevant information from the cards?"	nikolajanevski	post	15.02409088739817	female	White	0.9991558790206909	na	na	na	12	dbtselfhelp
"Occasionally my therapist would have checked through it before the session, but most of the time it happened at the beginning of our session. It would be great if we were our therapists’ only clients and they had all the time in the world to prepare, but unfortunately they don’t. 

It sounds like this could be solved with some communication. Could you do a small bulletpoint list at the bottom of your diary card with the most significant events that week, or things you want to specifically talk about? 

In my experience, the diary card is very much a jumping off point so the therapist can see how you’ve done that week. You absolutely can bring up whatever you want at any time during the session. If you’re talking about something, but you think another topic is more crucial, don’t be afraid to politely move the conversation on to something else."	nikolajanevski	reply	na	na	na	0.9991558790206909	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
They are meant to be reviewed in the session with the client. A major function of dc is for the client to build more skill with labeling and identifying their emotions, thoughts/urges, and behaviors. As well as skill tracking. The IT uses it largely to track patterns for chains and to strength more skills to disrupt patterns. I also think it’s reasonable to ask for more orientation to the DC. Maybe they haven’t oriented you enough to the function of it or how it’s used in the process.	nikolajanevski	reply	na	na	na	0.9991558790206909	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Ahh I relate. My thoughts:

- yes it’s normal for them to only read them at the beginning of the session

- my therapist reads through quickly, but I know she does read it all. If you think your therapist isn’t reading it all, maybe you can say something about that. Like “hey a lot happened this week and I want to make sure you’re aware of it all; did you read the whole thing? I feel unheard/unseen when important things are unacknowledged.” or something. Could make it into a dearman if you want. 

- DBT therapists work pretty strictly within the DBT framework (if they are doing full DBT and all that). The DBT framework says that you have to deal with stuff in this order: life-threatening behaviors (suicidal stuff), therapy-interfering behaviors, and then quality-of-life-interfering behaviors. So if you have suicidal or self harm stuff on your diary card, they kinda have to at least ask about that first. 

- When I was in hardcore DBT, I also felt like a lot of stuff was missed and not talked about. In some ways, it turned out okay because we ended up talking about what helped me most in the long term (working through trauma). But in hindsight, I think it would be been helpful for me to either have therapy more often (most DBT therapists won’t see you more than once a week, but you can see another therapist in addition if you feel like it’ll help.) or for longer time (I was doing 45 min a week for a while; could’ve asked for 1 hr or something) or to really go back to my original goals with my therapist and add some new ones. Like, in the time since I’ve treated my ptsd (successfully, yay! :) ), I’ve discovered I’m autistic. In hindsight, there were things going on in my life and problems caused by being autistic that I could’ve brought up in therapy years ago, and might’ve even been on my diary card, but my suicidal thoughts and self harm and ptsd symptoms were just way worse and higher priority. So I didn’t investigate autism properly or talk about those sorts of things in therapy until the higher priorities were dealt with. But I think it turned out okay. On the other hand, knowing I was autistic earlier probably would’ve helped. So idk. Just my musings lol"	nikolajanevski	reply	na	na	na	0.9991558790206909	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I think of therapy like dating--finding a good therapist is grueling, and when you find the (rare) right one it's amazing, but most of them range from meh to terrible. 

If you have a therapist you don't click well with, the therapist-client relationship is gonna take more communication and work than with someone you really click with. 

Assuming the availability of DBT therapists around you is low, I honestly think this is a great moment to practice the interpersonal effectiveness module. I would practice dialectics, or the ""alternate possibilities"" step of check the facts, to give her the benefit of the doubt of why she's doing this, because it might not be intentional (of course, it also could be--no way to know unless you communicate). And then I would use DEAR MAN to communicate that you would like to structure your time around the diary cards differently. Maybe you come prepared with a list of cards/events you'd like to discuss beforehand, and communicate that those are what you would like to focus on--there's no way she would know to focus on those unless you tell her. Or maybe you can ask her to simply spend a little more time reading through them each session. Overall, I would come up with a list of the behavior that you want from her and put it into the Negotiate part of DEAR MAN. 

As for my therapy experience with diary cards, I honestly find most therapists a little stingy with their time (not their fault; it's a very exhausting job), so they always looked through them in session. My therapist usually directed questions like, ""what did you notice this week in your diary cards?"" or ""what was important to you in your diary cards this week?"" which naturally meant that what I wanted to talk about the most eventually came out. So you could suggest structuring your time like this. 

All in all, I do think that expecting your therapist to naturally pick up what you want to talk about just based on the diary cards is probably a little too high of a bar, especially since you started recently and she presumably doesn't know you well. If the DEAR MAN doesn't go well though, then I'd be worried about the future of this therapist-client relationship."	nikolajanevski	reply	na	na	na	0.9991558790206909	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

I wrote her an email. One thing I guessed is that maybe she does not know how to extract all the diary cards into one document. So I told her how to do it. I also suggested we can start therapy 5 minutes later so she has time to read the cards - which I think is a very reasonable request.

"I’m a DBT therapist and I also train clinicians. We recommend that clinicians go over the diary card in session. The clinician is supposed to highlight life interfering behaviors first, followed by therapy interfering, followed by QOL interfering behaviors. When I would go through the DC, I’m having a conversation with the client and we collaboratively build the agenda. DBT is a principle-based therapy, not a protocoled therapy, so the clinician uses the DC to drive the session. Also, when it was developed, there were no apps. Marsha just had piles of DCs printed on green paper and we handed them to clients. DBT therapists are also observing how clients react to the DC aspect of therapy; Some people have difficulty disclosing or discussing target behaviors, and those subtle interactions are important.   
  
DBT is a very different therapy from a lot therapies and there’s long pretreatment phase. Your therapist has a lot to orient you to, and it will happen.

"I'm a little confused--can you clarify if you're in a DBT program/have a DBT therapist? If so, I personally found the program pretty hands on--they give you daily homework to implement strategies and I also filled out a diary card twice a day. Pretty much every skill is a strategy and of course there's an explanation of how it works, which is theoretical, but the skill itself is a strategy. I'm just trying to clarify if you looking for something more concrete on top of this or are you trying to learn DBT by yourself? 

If the latter, honestly I recommend finding a program because I think that will help you a lot with this problem, but if you can't do that, I think people find success by following the DBT program structure alone--diary cards 1-5x per day depending on your needs, daily homework, new skill weekly. 

If you're already in a program and find DBT too theoretical, honestly you'll probably prefer CBT, which focuses much more on strategies and skills and less on explanations/theories. Depending on your specific needs, you should try and find a CBT therapist whose training is tailored to your diagnoses."	JBear_2007	reply	na	na	na	0.9977332353591919	no	strong	strong	na	dbtselfhelp

I think the best thing I did when I was having this problem was finding very tiny things that made me happy in the moment. So I know the point of the skill is to find activities that you can repeat to find positive emotions, but what worked better for me was to just notice in the day when something made me happy or content. So like if I had a nice cup of tea or a bite of food I really liked, or maybe the weather was really pleasant or I watched a video I really enjoyed, I would notice in the moment and say to myself how much I was enjoying it.

For a while now, I've had one event that has lead me to have to deal with general feelings of despair and sorrow, but a couple of days ago another one was added to it. Since that one is still fresh and the older one is there too, I have been feeling the negative emotions a lot and I don't really know how to deal with it. I know radical acceptance would be applicable, but I was hoping someone would have an idea of other skills I could use too. It might also be worth adding that these weren't events that had a direct impact on my life, but just that learning of them had a big emotional impact on me.

"Radical acceptance and mindfulness are what will actually digest/process feelings of sadness and grief. 

But no one can process 24/7. I think accumulating positive experiences (forget what that is called in DBT) is another one to try. 

IMPROVE is also a good one to try now. I would suggestion something like giving yourself a half hour a day to practice mindfulness, radical acceptance,  and maybe prayer/meaning from ""IMPROVE,"" maybe do some journalling.

"I've been diagnosed with BPD (traits), and I've recently started working on DBT.  My biggest problem is trying to manage my FP relationship so it goes away.  There are a lot of things to cope with when it comes to having an FP, but the specific part of that relationship I need to learn to manage is the constant fixation on that person.  No matter what's happening, whenever I don't have anything else to think about, my thoughts ""default"" back to them.  It's harder than dealing with other intrusive thoughts, since I can't cope by telling myself ""It's only a thought.""  It's not my mind trying to tell me something, it's my mind getting stuck at a single point.

So far I've learned about distraction skills, and they do help, but distraction only goes so far when something is so constant.  Which modules and skills should I focus on to manage my fixation on my FP?  Does anyone have any personal experience about what worked for them?  I couldn't find a direct answer when I searched through this sub.  Thanks for your help.

I asked on the BPD sub first, but I didn't get a response.  There doesn't seem to be much of a focus on treatment there."	AnonymousWaddleDee	post	34.98296293700189	male	White	0.9935095906257629	na	na	na	5	dbtselfhelp
"So I welcome others to chime in, but I consider myself a recovered BPD person and I don't find that having an FP disappears. Like, I've gotten better about not creating a toxic relationship with my FP, and sometimes I don't have an FP or my FP changes, but personally I find that I still have stronger emotions/attachments to my loved ones than other people, even if I'm (relatively) not toxic anymore. 

Personally, my biggest remedy against fixation is to find fulfillment in as many people as possible. For example, when I have an FP, I want to spend all my time with them and can spend 6+ hours a day talking to them. In this case, I practice opposite action and force myself to keep contact with other people by hanging out with them (sans FP) and texting them regularly. I also force myself to keep an identity that's separate from my FP by making sure I have at least one activity (e.g. book club, volunteering group, hobby of some kind) that doesn't involve them. 

I also think that part of what creates the FP dynamic is putting the other person on a pedestal and the splitting that comes with that. This is really really hard and honestly, I haven't quite mastered it, but you need to practice dialectical thinking about your FP. For example, one thing I'm working on really hard right now is to understand that when my FP is mad at me, it doesn't mean they love me any less. Being able to think dialectically means that it stops feeling like such a catastrophe when your FP fails you in some way, and I think that the less you can put your FP on a pedestal, the less they feel like a lifeline, and the less you fixate on them. 

I'd like to just note that for me, these skills help lessen the fixation and create a healthier dynamic, but they don't get rid of fixation. I think it's important to remember that what BPD folks experience is just an extreme version of what neurotypical people experience. For example, even ""normal"" people will have ""FPs"" sometimes in that they might go through a honeymoon phase in a new relationship, or it's common for parents to get very attached to their children. Those are all technically the same behavior that BPD people go through; it's just that BPD folks will take it to an extreme. So I don't think you should try to stop having attachment preferences where you prioritize one person/a select few people--that much is ""normal"" and I don't think humans can help themselves. I hope this makes you feel a little bit more ""normal"" and I just want you to know you're not a failure if you prioritize one person above the rest. 

Hope this helps! Sending loving kindness your way :)"	AnonymousWaddleDee	reply	na	na	na	0.9935095906257629	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I’m not diagnosed with BPD or traits, but I can heavily relate to the dsm diagnostic criteria. 

The skills I’ve found helpful are face the facts, opposite action, ABC Please, using wise mind, DEAR MAN, GIVE and Fast(when I do interact with them), and when it’s appropriate to do which mix of them. 

One outlet I’ve found as a coping skill is to journal. I write whatever I want to say on my notes app, some excersise book, whatever. The point is the least resistant way to get it out of my head in that moment. In doing so it’s created useful insights into myself and my relationship with my FP."

It's not that I think I'm a failure if I have an FP, more that the attachment really, really hurts, and I'd rather not experience that again.

"Yeah, this is totally relatable to me. I'll never forget the look of utter confusion on my ex's face when I was trying to explain how falling in love is a *miserable* experience for me. It was the first time I realized that people are actually...only happy?...when they fall in love--I can't even imagine what that's like. 

I think that part of it is that every attachment is different and comes with its own insecurities and problems. I'd encourage you to use the STUN wave to figure out your sensations, thoughts, and urges when you feel hurt by your FP--what are the specific problems in this particular relationship? Then you can check the facts and problem solve as needed. Honestly nothing is foolproof, but my first relationship when I was a teen, I managed to call my then-boyfriend 200 times in--I think 50 minutes? because he accidentally slept in. And in my last relationship, my partner was gone for weeks for business trips or backpacking trips and I self soothed and didn't mind (too much) that I couldn't contact him for 3 weeks at a time.

"TW: paranoid thoughts about partner finding others attractive

Hey all,

I’m currently doing the Facing your Feelings workbook but I’m finding it difficult to apply it to what I’m currently struggling with: ruminating on previous conversations with my husband. Specifically, I am thinking about these two conversations that happened YEARS ago: 1. When he said he’d like to go to a nude beach for the experience & 2. When we talked about possibly having a threesome. 

The first one wasn’t really a conversation but all of a sudden, recently (probably because I’ve been really self conscious about my body) I’ve thought about why he said that -does he want to look at other women? What if he gets an erection for someone else? 

The second one was initiated by me (I don’t even know why), and I took it back later, and my husband agreed with me. But now I’m thinking, if I brought it up again, would he want that? Is our sex life not good enough? 

I haven’t spoken to my husband much about these recent thoughts because I know I’m just getting stuck in my head. How can I deal with these thoughts? Should I speak to my husband about them? How? 

TIA ❤️"	sivmas	post	27.86276760403856	female	White	0.9979835748672485	na	na	na	9	dbtselfhelp
"This isn't exactly DBT, but I read a very interesting study by Martin Seligman (a very big name in clinical psychology; I'm pretty sure he's dead now but he used to teach at the University of Pennsylvania) about how people who ruminate less are more optimistic and happier. This sounds very silly, but his solution for rumination was to stop doing it. By which I mean, when you notice yourself ruminating, check the facts to stop any cognitive distortions, and if you find that the facts don't warrant rumination, then force yourself to think about something else--essentially all the distract skills in distress tolerance. If you do this often enough (according to his research), when the ruminations come up, your brain will automatically check the facts then dismiss the thought, and eventually you'll stop having these thoughts at all. 

Dismissing your ruminations won't necessarily solve the root problem though, which sounds like self-hatred and/or low self esteem and/or insecurity. Which is okay--everyone has low self esteem moments. If your husband is supportive, you can have him write out and/or record some notes for you that you can look back on and/or listen to when you need it. I have a collection of screenshots of everything nice that my loved ones have said about me. When I'm having a bad moment, it's my little reminder that my partner *does* find me sexy, I *am* a good friend, I *can* do my job, etc etc. This is sort of similar to loving kindness toward yourself, but honestly I find the outside validation very helpful because it feels a little more ""factual"" than just trying to convince yourself that you're beautiful/competent/a good person/etc. 

As for communicating with your husband, that's really up to you and your wise mind; I personally don't really believe in giving relationship advice to strangers because I don't know every little factor in your relationship. For example, rumination is hard to stop if the facts show that it's warranted--for instance, if you're ruminating because he recently cheated on you or because he's giving you less affection that usual, the real issue isn't the rumination, it's that you're not getting your emotional needs fulfilled. So I'll leave it up to your wise mind as to how to approach this with your husband, but I hope the self-soothing skills I mentioned above help. Best of luck with everything!

"Hi everyone, I already want to say thank you for your time if you stop to read this and comment.

For years now, I have had this crippling obsession with the feeling of being a boring person. I want so badly to have something novel and fun to say to people, or even just to start a conversation that someone is going to want to engage in, that it's causing me to not say anything at all and leaves me in abject misery. Especially in a one-on-one situation, I panic and believe I am just a shitty boring mess.

In my mind, there is a preset of ""great/perfect"" things to say to specific people; ways to make people laugh and want to talk to you, but the frustration of not being able to find ""that thing"" leaves me feeling unworthy of friendship or being around people in general. My ability to be able to get people laughing or talking for hours is something I am tethering **all of my worth** to.

This is hugely irrational; I don't have to be funny or super interesting for someone to want to be my friend or talk to me, but that's how it feels. That's how I remember it being in college (high school), if you weren't funny, people didn't want to know you. That was 15 years ago, though, but for whatever reason it's still in my head.

Is DBT something that would help to alleviate the issue to some degree? I understand that this could be ""fixed"" eventually, as its a mindset that can change, but I wonder if DBT is a good start to some form of recovery. Thanks again for taking the time to read. Take care."	RoseJamCaptive	post	21.043947423020178	male	White	0.01581510901451111	na	na	na	5	dbtselfhelp
"So the short answer to your question is that yes, I think DBT would help, though obviously you should consider the availability/wait list of programs, cost, quality of other programs near you, etc. before you make a decision.

The long answer to your question is that I think (if you can) you should identify the root cause of this issue. I can't quite tell from your post if this is an obsessive thought, or if you truly don't really have a sense of cohesive identity and you basically ""mold"" yourself to *seem* more interesting to the people around you. 

If the latter, it sounds like you're suffering from [identity disturbance](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.157.4.528), which is a classic symptom for BPD. Considering DBT was created to treat BPD, I believe that DBT would be able to help with identity diffusion. More specifically, the skills sets surrounding goals and values, the mindfulness module, and interpersonal skills concerning self-respect like FAST would all help solve the issue of incoherence. As someone who suffers a lot from dissociation and the identity disturbance that entails, though, even with DBT, this is really hard to treat and will likely take years.

The other (more straightforward) option is that you don't suffer from identity disturbance, but rather OCD/anxiety. That is, you feel pretty sure of who you are--what your values are, how you define yourself, etc. but you have these intrusive thoughts anyway, and maybe you have social anxiety in that you ruminate about your social interactions and whether people like you enough. Honestly, I have high anxiety and I believe that DBT is very helpful, BUT if you have *only* anxiety and no personality disorder, DBT isn't really necessary. There are plenty of studies showing how more conventional therapy methods like positive psychology and CBT are very effective in treating anxiety. Considering how much easier/often cheaper it is to access a CBT therapist, I don't see the need for DBT if you only suffer from anxiety and nothing else. Note that if you suffer from, for example, social dysphoria (a common symptom of ADHD if you have that), dysphoria is also a type of anxiety. 

In summary, if you feel you suffer from something relatively complicated like identity disturbance, DBT is almost necessary. If it's something relatively simple/well studied like anxiety, DBT is useful but not necessary."	RoseJamCaptive	reply	na	na	na	0.01581510901451111	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

The mindfulness pieces in DBT could probably help or a distress tolerance skill called mindfulness of current thoughts, but I've found the therapy overall not particularly suited to helping obsessive thinking specifically.

"Hi there! I’ve been searching for CBT alternatives for a while and decided DBT is the approach that suits me best. However, I had a really hard time finding therapists that practiced anything but CBT where I live. I recently found a couple of DBT doctors, but I could not pay for therapy alone. My family agreed to help with payments, and I booked my appointment and had everything ready. Unfortunately, they withdrew their support last minute and left me hanging, so I had to cancel.

It really crushed me, because for the first time in for ever I really hoped I was in the right mindset for therapy and I had found the right professionals. I’ve been thinking about trying to improve on my own but I really don’t know if it’s possible or where to start.

Can you practice DBT skills without a professional? And if so, where and how should I start?"	SpinachNo1563	post	24.902828759354524	female	White	0.9981623291969299	na	na	na	26	dbtselfhelp
"While it's likely very helpful to talk to a therapist who specializes in DBT, or doing a group, I started learning DBT during the pandemic and didn't have those options so I did it myself.

I bought the book 'The Expanded Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Training Manual' by Lane Pederson. I read the book cover to cover doing the worksheets it includes. When I was done with that, I read through it again but this time I made flash cards for myself along the way. When I was done with that, I read through the flash cards.

Then I found another book to do the same thing with, called 'The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook - Second Edition' by Matthew McKay, Jeffrey C. Wood, and Jeffrey Brantley. I haven't finished this because life got in the way.

I have also tried podcasts because I realized I was missing that human element to explain things better than a book could, using laymans terms and whatnot. Every podcast I've tried has not worked for me personally for one reason or another. So I am about to start reading through this second book again.

I've seriously considered a therapist, but the mental health industry is so fucked right now. Months long waitlists just to see someone that you don't even necessarily want to be seeing, but they're the only one taking new patients, etc.

Long story short, you can ABSOLUTELY do it on your own. Would it be better seeing someone and working with them in person? Probably. Hope that helps."	SpinachNo1563	reply	na	na	na	0.9981623291969299	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

Lots of good responses already! Just wanted to add that in my therapy group, we focused on one skill at a time. We would practice using them initially in every day, low-stress situations so that we’d be better prepared when the actual high stress situations arise. We started with the observation skill and then moved on to describing. If you need a place to start, that worked really well for me. Tracking your daily emotions can be really helpful as well to keep track of progress and pinpoint issues. If you’re interested, look up DBT diary cards. Good luck, you can totally do this!

You can absolutely self teach and practice DBT on your own. All DBT is is learning new coping skills, you don’t need a therapist for that. There’s a wealth of knowledge at your fingertips thanks to the internet. Plenty of resources are out there from internet articles, books and videos. Just figure out what skills DBT focuses on, and practice those skills, give it some times and then decide what skills work better for you than others. Abandon what doesn’t really work, keep practicing what does work. Eventually it becomes a second nature. You don’t need a therapist to practice skills.

I think I might already even have The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook on my laptop somewhere, but I was waiting to start therapy and get some professional advice lol. I guess I’ll start working on it! 

You’re right that it’s so hard to actually find help right now, and the prices are just crazy. It’s already hard enough to find someone you trust and feel comfortable with, let alone the right type of therapy, close to home, with affordable prices… Mission impossible.

If you don’t mind me asking, did you set a routine to work on the books? Like maybe once a week or so? Or did you just do it whenever? And also, how did you manage with keeping up? I’m really scared I’m just going to binge read like a hundred pages and then forget the book even exists if I don’t have anyone forcing me to work on it, so any tips on that would be awesome, if you have any.

So what I've done that was successful was to start with a planner. I plan out my week, every week. (It's not perfect and things can move day to day, but just having a rough idea of what I want to do on what days helps me a lot.) I plan for DBT on Mondays and Wednesdays for 1 hour each day. I downloaded a timer app, and at 8:30 those days I start it for 1 hour. When the timer goes off, I stop and I mark my page. If I come back and forget what I was doing, I'll back up and start where I know I'll understand it.	SpinachNo1563	reply	na	na	na	0.9981623291969299	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I went to a library two times a week just to study my therapy materials. In library there's silent study rooms that don't have anything else disturbing my focus.

For me as an introvert doing therapy by myself was actually very good fit and I got amazingly good results. I was actually waiting in line to start trauma therapy and got the book while waiting, but when finally a spot opened for a trauma therapist, we came to a conclusion that I didn't need therapy anymore since I had already done the work at the library and didn't struggle with symptoms anymore.

I have been doing dbt therapy for about 5 weeks now and am working on distress tolerance skills, however I am finding practising the skills very overwhelming. It frequently feels as though I don't know where I am meant to start or  I lose focus and then when an actual distressing scenario happens I can't use them. Does anyone have any tips for the way they practise their skills. Like doing one at a time and practising for a few days or...	flipfloppoohbear	post	31.08906949273561	male	White	0.9993767142295837	na	na	na	17	dbtselfhelp
"I literally came to this sub looking for answers to the same Q. I've just started DBT, and we're on the distress tolerance module. I'm really struggling to practice the skills when I am not in crisis because I don't understand  how they are supposed to help if I'm feeling okay - does that make sense? 

I get that practicing when ok, will help me use the skills better when I'm not, but I'm still finding it hard. It doesn't help I'm autistic and often find it really hard to understand aspects of the therapy."	flipfloppoohbear	reply	na	na	na	0.9993767142295837	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
Are you doing this with a therapist? If so I would ask them. If not, I can give you some general advice as someone who has seen a therapist and practices DBT. My own therapist advised that I do my homework daily, consistency is key. (Though of course there will be some days you miss just try to get a good rythym). As far as losing focus I would also make sure your practicing mindfulness during these exercises. So every time you feel yourself losing focus, gently bring your focus back. I’m telling you there were times where I had to do this thirty or so times during a session and that’s ok! It doesn’t hurt the practice of DBT, it’s a part of it. As far as where to start, i would recommend finding either a therapist trained in DBT, or at least a workbook that has exercises. There are some good books out there that will give you a good starting place. I don’t have one but my therapist said they exist. Good luck!	flipfloppoohbear	reply	na	na	na	0.9993767142295837	no	strong	strong	na	dbtselfhelp
"Seconding u/jamofthemonthclub that consistency is key! I totally get the feeling of being overwhelmed though--trying to juggle all the skills at once is a lot to take in! I'd suggest focusing on one skill per week, then pocketing it so that you can use it when it's needed rather than practicing every day. 

I also think that honestly, distress tolerance is a hard module to start on because the skills you learn are really easy to understand, but really freaking hard to implement, especially since most people in DBT have high emotional reactivity. The best piece of advice my therapist gave me was to practice the skills when I'm *not* in distress, and doing that enough times means you'll be more likely to learn to react with healthy coping mechanisms when the time comes. 

Honestly though, it'll take months and months of practice. I've been practicing DBT for 4 years now and I still mess up occasionally. I'd just try your best and if you lose control, just remind yourself that next time is always another opportunity to try again :) Best of luck!

If you’re “feeling OK” then the practice is just practice, and it would be understandable if it doesn’t “help” or do anything at all. It’s truly just to have your body and brain learn what the skill is and what it feels like. Importantly, it also allows you to *prepare* to use the skill—where is the bowl you’ll use for the Temperature skill and do you have ice ready, what headphones will you use and what music will you listen to for distraction, where is your weighted blanket for self-soothing, etc. it allows you to make sure you’re ready and less overwhelmed when emotion-mind crisis hits.

"Think of the practice more as like training your brain. DBT (once you’ve got it down) is alot of muscle memory like once you do the skills enough you don’t even think of it as DBT or have to remind yourself cause it’s just your automatic natural response now. When I was learning, something that helped me get there was to verbally say “okay I’m feeling _____ so here’s my go to coping skill: ___, for this scenario. Etc.”
We talk alot of about triggers right? Think of those triggers and how you think you should respond to them based on your skills sheet and pretend you need it right then. Verbally, say “hey I am feeling really anxious, I’m gonna use *the coping skill you chose* because that’s what I do when I feel really anxious and now I don’t feel anxious. Simply saying it out loud can start to build muscle memory and eventually when something triggers an anxiety attack, your brains muscle memory kicks in and that feeling of anxiety triggers you to use *coping skill* it’s kinda like training your subconscious if that makes sense. I don’t know if I made it make sense but keep training. It may feel pointless but training is how you get to a point where your automatic response to any situation is a skill you learned in DBT.

Here's a tip that might help: you're not going to feel understood or supported in the way you deserve to be...it's one of those reality acceptance things. Instead, just participate with a loose grip. Go along with everything they're telling you to do, as if you're in an experiment and not a commitment. Like, okay, fine, I'll try all these things, even if I don't see the point. Think of all the skills as clothes you have to try on. Some seem like styles you'd never wear, but what does it hurt to try it on, and even act like you like the style for the moment.

"One day, I was talking to my therapist about my experience with religion. Basically, I was raised in a non-denominational Christian household, and I've always felt like an imposter in church. I've gone back and forth questioning whether I'm an atheist or agnostic, but anyway, my therapist pointed out that typically clients who undergo DBT develop a sense of spiritual growth near the end of their treatment. I'm nowhere near the end, but I'd like to work on achieving spiritual well-being without feeling like an imposter. 

Maybe this question is irrelevant to the group, but what does spirituality even look like, if you don't even believe in anything? But more relevant, does Marsha Linehan reference any specific tips for this anywhere in the workbook that I can look at?

"Mindfulness is the foundation of DBT, and mindfulness is also a core part of many spiritual traditions. You can take a mundane approach or a spiritual approach to mindfulness, or a bit of both. 

Meditation, contemplative prayer, and observing particular rituals can all be ways of practising mindfulness that overlap with a spiritual practice. 

Marsha Linehan herself references her Catholic school upbringing, contemplative prayer, and her practices as a Buddhist and Zen master as influences on DBT. 

Some elements of the mindfulness module in DBT come directly from spiritual traditions. For example, the idea of loving kindness is known in Buddhism as ""metta"".

There are other elements of DBT which could also foster a sense of spiritual growth. For example, in the emotion regulation module, as part of the ""A"" in ABC, we learn to accumulate positive events in the long term by discerning our personal values, and creating goals that direct us to live in line with our wise mind values.  Realising your personal values can often give someone a sense of meaning and purpose that may change their understanding of their place in the world. For some people, this can be a spiritual experience. 

DBT also gives us skills for connecting and forming stronger connections with others and the world around us. For people who experience a sense of spirituality or faith, as you begin to experience more connection in your life, you may experience that as spiritual.

For me personally, the way I relate to my spirituality through DBT is through a sense of surrender. Many of the skills are geared towards reality acceptance, letting go, and embracing change. The more I let go of the things that I can't control, the more I feel a part of something that is much bigger than me, and that builds my faith.

Faith doesn't have to be faith in a higher power either. You can have faith in yourself, faith in others. I think that as you repair some of the damage caused by maladaptive behaviours, it becomes more possible to have faith again, in whatever form that may take for someone."	ellijustice	reply	na	na	na	0.0032588171306997538	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I don't think you have to be part of any established religion to ""be spiritual"". I think in terms of DBT, it's more about developing a macroscopic view instead of being caught up in your emotions and negative (or positive) things that happen in your life. Also, to develop another motivation to participate fully in life, in your community, etc. - it's much easier to do that if you have the sense of doing something ""for the greater good"", for humanity and beyond, with the feeling of a ""divine"" calling, that burning flame inside you that won't go out...

Take a look at mindfulness handout 7A, where she lists 7 characteristics of mystical experiences and go from there to define what your spirituality might look like.

For me, meditating about our size and ""importance"" in space gives a semi-spiritual or ""mystical"" feeling.

"I’m not sure which note book you have (the blue skills training one or the green workbook) but I’m sure if you look in the back if there’s an index, you’ll be able to find the sections that spirituality is under. In my blue training book, it says it is in sections about goals of mindfulness training, the IMPROVE skills & wise mind practise. 

Spirituality is more about belief in something bigger than yourself. People often are spiritual and use God, the universe, nature or astrology as ways to guide their experiences and their times on Earth. There’s also an aspect of having reliable faith and turning over your fears and worries to a higher authority that probably benefits people with BPD, or anxiety or anything similar. It doesn’t have to be religious, and I think maybe a good way to start for you is to explore your own thoughts and feelings about your beliefs and your spirituality, you could journal or talk to someone about it. Perhaps once you understand what you believe in, you could start to explore different things that you are drawn to (things your intuition signals too, things you’ve always wondered for a long time) and do activities, reading, watching films/shows/videos based on the topic. just remember that your spiritual journey is entirely your own and even if you decide you’re not a spiritual person at all, that’s completely okay! lots of luck! x"	ellijustice	reply	na	na	na	0.0032588171306997538	no	no	strong	na	dbtselfhelp

I'm hoping you can share with me the resources you've found most helpful in teaching yourself DBT.  For background, I'm the mom of a teenager with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety and panic disorder (we get the official diagnosis this week, but maybe ADHD too).  He has been hospitalized a few times, but it hasn’t helped that much. He finally has a therapist that he likes who knows/uses DBT. People have recommended the intensive DBT program, but he refuses to do the groups. He can't handle hearing other people's trauma and did not like the groups in the hospital. However, without hesitation, he agreed to read the DBT Skills workbook with me at home and practice the skills. He wants to learn how to feel better and I'm desperate to help. Can you put yourself in the shoes of a teenage boy - what resources would you relate to most?  He loves youtube, so I'd like to find something there. Thank you!!

"Hi OP,

First of all, what a wonderful mother you are. I'm sorry your son is struggling so much. I also had those diagnoses as a kid (which later turned into a BD and PTSD diagnosis), and I know it was an absolute nightmare for everyone involved, including my parents. I promise there's a light at the end of the tunnel--thanks for holding on and fighting for your kid. 

Second of all, there are actually DBT courses for parents for this exact reason--usually the kids are also in DBT, but the parent DBT courses teach parents to communicate with their children in DBT terminology. I'd see if one of these courses/programs are available near you. Maybe once you learn a particular skill that week in class, you can go home and teach the skills to your kid. If he has any questions, you can go back the following week and ask them to your own group. 

Third, if his therapist is DBT trained, shouldn't his therapist be teaching him DBT? If he can't handle groups for some reason, his therapist should be able to take up the gap in his DBT ""education"" and simply teach him the skills him/herself. 

Finally, I know it's terribly difficult to change a teenager's mind, but I'd just like to note that many DBT groups explicitly forbid you to mention anything traumatic to varying degrees. I honestly think most DBT groups in inpatient programs aren't the greatest quality, and it sounds like he hasn't experienced an outpatient therapy group. My personal group forbade any mention of problem behaviors (substance abuse, self harm, etc), so the problems people brought up were very vague and not at all triggering. I know this won't necessarily change his mind, but I'd work with his therapist to try and find some groups that fit his needs."

There’s a podcast called the Psychology of Self Injury that’s informative and non judgmental.  Also, the DBT skills group that we are in specifically requires that all subjects are kept vague and there is no discussion of personal trauma. Any examples that people give have to be very benign, and we do not get into details of why anybody is there.

My son's therapist is actually one of the persons to suggest he do the group. She is trained in DBT, but does not work with the groups directly (I think anyway... I'm still learning all this). She said that she would work with him on his trauma and the group would help him learn coping skills.  It sounded like a good plan, but then he said he would not do the group. So I suggested we do self study and he agreed.  

I absolutely will continue to push him towards a group as everything I'm reading shows it is the best route for success.  Good to know there are boundaries on talking about triggers.

"So, I've decided that I want to make more friends, since, not counting family, I only have two friends. I used the SMART skill to make a plan to visit the local game shop to see if there were any groups playing DND nearby. Sadly for me, the groups are all online, and my internet is too lousy to play online. Then, I decided to make a new Facebook account (since my old one got hacked, and I can't get back into it) to see if there are any events happening locally I could attend to meet some people. Sadly again, everything is too far away or it's a Bible study (which doesn't appeal to me). At least I used opposite to emotion I guess, as my instinct was to just give up. 

I need skills to address some things. First, I am angry that the internet at my mom's house where I am living is so lousy. My mom has complained to our internet provider several times. All they tell her is, ""It looks good on our end,"" and they never fix it. My mom tried reporting them to the BBB over it, and they must have found out it was her. This happened before I moved back home, but she said they shut off her internet for two weeks over it. We can't get another internet service provider, because the house is on a county line, and no one else will give us internet where we live. My step dad refuses to let us try satellite internet as an alternative. I could rant more about why we need better internet, but I'll leave it at that. 

Then, there's the fact that I'm unemployed, and my social skills are garbage. There's nothing to do around here apparently. I feel like I don't stand a chance at making any new friends and that I'm doomed to be lonely. I'm grateful for the friends I do have, don't get me wrong. They're wonderful to me. But I just want to expand my circle, I crave new experiences, and I want new hobbies that involve people.

"Hi OP,

First of all, I'm sorry you're in such a frustrating living situation. I know how devastating isolation is and no one deserves to feel alone. 

I think that one thing that could help is radical acceptance for things that are out of your control. For example, maybe radically accepting that your internet situation can't get better will lead you to think of something that's not internet-based, or look for internet somewhere else. Do you have a local public library? Libraries usually offer internet services for free, and often offer classes, book talks, and even events like board game times, so I'd definitely check out if you can find out what the libraries near you offer. 

Second, once you've identified what you *can* change, maybe problem solving those? For example, I'd encourage getting some kind of job if you're physically able to. I really think that an environment where you're forced to interact with other human beings is the best way to potentially find new friends. Maybe see if the local game shop is hiring? I feel like a lot of places are looking for minimum wage workers, and I know the work absolutely sucks but I do think that you get to meet some very cool people when you work minimum wage jobs. Or maybe volunteering? I find that there are tons of lonely people when you volunteer (homeless people, the elderly, etc) who just want a friendly ear. It's most likely not a connection you can have as a friend, but it really helped for me to be able to feel a connection with absolutely anyone at all. Alternatively, if you're physically incapacitated or can't volunteer, maybe there are programs for others to visit you--there are programs near me to visit the housebound (elderly, vets, etc) and talk to them, for example. 

Additionally, is there any chance you could find friends by meeting your friends' friends? I'd try and see if you can get invited to their gatherings. Another option is to see what events your town holds--any community theatre, or town bbqs, etc. 

Not having a good number of friends absolutely sucks, and I'm sorry you're going through that. Not having great internet in this day and age is doubly isolating. I hope that some of these suggestions pan out!"	ellijustice	reply	na	na	na	0.9974007606506348	strong	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Hi all, thanks for reading. A minor Trigger Warning for stigma against BPD, perhaps. (Sorry!)

I'm really struggling quite a bit with a diagnosis that I don't have yet. It's a long story, but at 32 years old, I'm considering Borderline Personality Disorder for the first time. My therapist says I have ""some borderline traits"" but she doesn't want to make the diagnosis. I've been searching for the better part of a year to try to get an assessment of some sort, I don't really know how - but my new psychiatrist says that she can diagnose me if I want.

I'm not ready. I don't feel like I can handle it. My only coping strategy for the past 16 months (since I've been considering it) has been denial. It's easy enough to convince myself a lot of the time. Most of my symptoms are pretty ""quiet"" so a few people have told me that I don't act like someone with borderline personality disorder. Even now, I find myself trying to prove that I don't have it. I started doing DBT before I had ever considered BPD, and I've improved my behavior to the point that I think I don't currently exhibit 5 diagnostic criteria. But I probably did before. If I got to remission before getting diagnosed it doesn't count, right?

I really, really do not want to have BPD. When I convince myself that I don't have it, I feel so good. Then I encounter some evidence that I do have it, and I spiral. I can't sleep, I can't focus at work, and I can't be pleasant to others. I just stay in my room and cry. Until I talk myself down again. Sometimes this feels like I'm using CBT and identifying cognitive distortions - surely, when I feel like I have BPD, that's just catastrophizing. But right now it feels like I do have BPD, and the rest of the time is denial. Mostly I try to live in that state of denial because it makes me a much more functional person. My therapist encourages it. She says ""maybe try to focus on the ways in which you don't fit the criteria"". I kind of think denial can even be a DBT skill for Distress Tolerance in a way - I read something about ""push away your problems away temporarily.""

I think I need to Radically Accept this, but I don't know how.

I've practiced Radical Acceptance for small things. I think it has helped somewhat with anger, actually. I can use Radical Acceptance for traffic, and for misunderstandings at work, and maybe for some bigger disappointments. But this one just feels impossible. It's too big. I can't accept it. I need to go back to denial. I can't do it. I just can't.

I've read a little about ""Turning the Mind"" which seems like maybe a strategy for things that are too big to Radically Accept all at once. Does anyone have experience with this?

Does anyone have experience with Radically Accepting something really huge, that felt absolutely unbearable?

Thanks so much everyone."	throwaway684355	post	23.863466596657805	male	White	0.04963834956288338	na	na	na	12	dbtselfhelp
"The shame and solitude of a BPD diagnosis is an illusion in the mind of the sufferer. You're teetering on the edge of nothing. Nothing will be different about you. Your doctors know not to hype this up as much as you have. It is a signpost for a treatment pathway, not an identity. You are not branded for life as some prefer to believe about themselves out of self-pity. You are not due any sympathy. The diagnostic criteria for BPD are dodgy - if you don't like it, good, look up CPTSD and start thinking of yourself as an organism rather than an object of derision.

I'd try the DBT skill 'check the facts' before accepting whatever it is you think you're terrified of - I've helped with a much as I care to, but you need to do your own homework on this, and the library/academic sources are going to be far better than Reddit.

Also far better than asking anyone else to deal with your feelings for you and this is what DBT is for - sorry, but what you need is signposting rather than sympathy.

Teach yourself new things or trust others to tell you who the fuck you are - one leads to self-actualization, the other to a 11-13% chance of suicide.

Just offering another perspective: do you actually need/want a diagnosis? A diagnosis tells psychiatrists and therapists how to best treat us. If you’re already in DBT and its helping, what would getting a diagnosis do? Some people like getting a diagnosis because jts nice to have an explanation to their behavior and easy to explain to others.

"With Radical Acceptance and Turning the mind, it's something that has to happen over and over I experienced, it's not something that happens all at once. I would highly suggest with your situation maybe researching checking the facts, and some other emotional regulation pieces that will help you cope. I say check the facts because like you said you don't have a official diagnosis, and with putting assumptions on whether you do and how that impacts you needs to be carefully looked at. Checking facts allows you to look at a situation and how to handle things even in the worse case scenario, in your case maybe getting a official diagnosis, and then allows you to proceed forward. Distress tolerance skills might help if you do in fact find out it's legitimate and you're officially considered and coping ahead is a useful skill that might help too. I think in the end though I'm reading a bit of jumping to conclusions and honestly and please don't take this as off putting, I would just really focus the other skills and do your best to not put so much emphasis on the ""diagnosis"". How you handle your response is one thing, and knowing your still you in the end is another regardless what your traits may be. I look at it as more problem solving the traits than just looking at the whole big picture and putting the whole diagnosis label on yourself. Check your facts, problem solve as you go, if anything really dive into some other skills and keep mindfulness in mind that even with a diagnosis life can still continue."	throwaway684355	reply	na	na	na	0.04963834956288338	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"heyy, commenting bc I relate.

idk if I do or don't have bpd. im kind of holding both at the same time. my bpd was also very quiet for about 10 years, and since seeing a psych? a lot of my issues have since been largely attributed to my newly diagnosed autism. 

but dbt has still been *incredibly* helpful, it reminded me of a lot of things I used to do and one or two things I'd never done. getting back into the rhythm of mindfulness(and having more words for it) has been amazing.

what I've come to? is that nothing in the mind is static. that, although i havent always, i fit the criteria for bpd at the time of diagnosis. which means it's within my reach to not fit the criteria again. but also that i still need to be wary. 

the diagnosis may technically exist on my medical record forever? but that's just paper. it's a medical classification to make treatment more efficient. we've been studying the human mind for(historically speaking) a very short time. i doubt we've perfected ways of classifying thoughts/behaviours. and even if we have nearly perfected it? reducing an entire person and life lived to a set of symptoms is... kinda juvenile. I've seen some medical professionals do it? but they see people at their worsts and if you've seen a lot of  people diagnosed with bpd at their worst? I kiiind of understand the
weird tension vibe I'll get sometimes. just gotta be chill and kind and prove em wrong

in terms of radically accepting my diagnosis? i dont see it as swallowing a hard difficult fact. truth is too complicated for any human to fully understand. we're always going to be looking at the world through some kind of lens; society, math, religion, language ect. everything man made thing created to understand the world is going to be at least a little bit flawed bc humans are flawed. *real* ""truth"" is something beyond any of us. it's just too big. so? there's no point worrying about it. because you and nobody else for that matter will ever know the full truth about the vast majority of things. 

again, diagnosis is just a medical classification of thoughts/behaviours(personality disorders especially) to make treatment more efficient. if dbt techniques work? then they work, which is cool. it can be as simple as that."	throwaway684355	reply	na	na	na	0.04963834956288338	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
Sorry, I won't be answering your question but I have some suggestions to explore that may or may not help... What does a diagnosis mean to you? DSM disorders are clusters of symptoms and unfortunately the words we've used to describe these clusters have social stigma attached to them. Which is more disturbing- the symptoms or the social impact? If you feel that you are in remission, what does meeting criteria in the past mean for you? It almost seems like there's something attached to this diagnosis that means your future will be destined for failure or something?

"Echoing what most others have said with Check The Facts. Also maybe discuss Coping Ahead with your therapist, or look into making a coping skills toolkit 🙂

Radical Acceptance is incredibly difficult, but one thing I can say about BPD & Radical Acceptance is that with the right frame of mind (Turn the Mind, like you said!), *there is a power in this diagnoses.* 

Personality disorders are unlike any other mental health disorder in that they are trauma-based and cannot be medicated away, they require specific, focused therapy & a want to seek treatment. Sounds scary, but what this means is that despite the stigma, you likely won’t have to take meds for the rest of your life, or be in and out of hospitals - you are in control of your life, emotions, and treatment (even if it doesn’t always feel that way!

"It can sometimes feel like trying to lift Olympic-class weights without the training; the form makes sense, the motions, but it's just too much.

As others have mentioned, distress tolerance exercises could be a boon while you do that afformentioned training of thinking in Wisemind. I still find I have to physically stop myself to undo the tension that emotions run amok can bring, but I'm getting there.

The biggest part is the practice. A thing that was mentioned once and became something of an anthem in my group was Practice While You're Calm. Any of it, all of it - practice using your skills while you are calm, practice using Wisemind while you are calm, etc. It is not the waste of time it feels like - by practicing these things while you are calm and regulated (basically near wisemind without using those words), you will also create an association between using these skills and *being* calm, which your body and subconscious would recognize and respond to by lowering heart rate, calming your thoughts.

Again, training. Most things in life are not much different that muscles in my example - they work best when trained and practiced."	Danaheh	reply	na	na	na	0.9991806149482727	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"What helps me is to flip through the DBT skills workbook. Eventually I’ll find a page in there that helps me understand what I’m feeling. I notice this particularly with the shame emotion. Sometimes when I feel shame I shut down a little bit and it’s hard for me to use skills. 

Try to find which emotion is underneath your “overwhelmed,confused,exhausted” 

Is there sadness perhaps… The fact that you have the awareness that you want to use skills, but aren’t sure which skills to use, is an expression of your wise-mind. 

It sounds like you need to dig more into what emotions you are actually experiencing. 

Try to uncover the emotion underneath your overwhelmed/exhausted feeling. Then it will be easier to make a choice about what actions or non-actions may help you feel better.

If a person is “overwhelmed,confused,exhausted” because they are afraid of an upcoming social interaction. One strategy for that could be to approach the situation causing the fear. (There are other options, but that is just one strategy DBT suggests)

However,

If a person is “overwhelmed,confused,exhausted” because they just finished visiting with their well-off, privileged, seemingly perfect relative, and the person is feeling Jealousy - one strategy would be to count all of your blessings to try and increase feelings of gratitude and satisfaction in your own life.

"Hi.  This is going to be a case of ""do as I say, not as I do"", because I'm in a similar position.  I think (at least for me) it's about getting to a place where I realise that, although I am not particularly optimistic about my longer-term chances just now, I do get immediate benefit from applying the old DBT when I start to get distressed.  And that is the reason to learn and apply the techniques.  I don't know what things will be like a couple of hours from now, never mind a couple of decades ... but, the distress-management/mindfulness/emotional regulation exercises do help in the moment.  And that brings blessed relief and saves me going down my habitual anxiety spiral.

Also, I recently got a DBT Workbook which is helpful. Having a structured way to learn DBT (Chapter 1, then 2...) and some practical exercises (which feel silly at first but damn well work) ends up providing its own motivation.

You can make a pros and cons list.

As many as you can think of for each.

Then keep the list around, and any time you find yourself turning away from skills, take a look at the list and remind yourself why you want to use skills.

It all comes back to the Life Worth Living Goal in DBT! The LWLG is whatever it would take to keep you living in your life. For some, it's moving out of an unhappy living situation, for others it's starting a family. Maybe it's getting a job on a career path you care about. For me, it was getting a pet! If you can determine what your Life Worth Living looks like it will be much easier to motivate yourself to use the skills that will get you there. There's no way I would have been functional enough to have a pet, a relationship, and my own place without these skills. And there are hard days when I don't want to use my skills.

I’m trying not to build up this unrealistic idea of them. I get sad when they don’t show up to group, and I specifically look forward to seeing them each week (but I look forward to seeing all of my group, just them a little more). They are single. Since we are virtual, I am tempted to DM them one on one (which I will not actually do). I feel slightly obsessed and of course jump a head of myself and daydream about them. 

Switching groups isn’t an option for me, and I don’t want to tell my therapist in case I am made to switch. I think I can cope with it on my own, I just need to know what skills I can use.

Realistically I won’t do anything because I value my place in the program, and obviously dating isn’t allowed.

"If I were in that situation, I would treat these feelings and thoughts just like my other unhelpful feelings and thoughts-- valid, worth recognizing and attending to, not necessarily rooted in fact, and not in control of my behavior.

It sounds like you're doing a lot of this already:

\- Mindfulness of the current moment--> bringing focus back to the task at hand not only during group but also when I notice daydreams outside of group, bc even if they feel good short-term, I don't want to put energy into stuff I know won't serve me or my goals

\- Wise mind -->

\*Try and identify all the facts of the situation in my rational mind (I'm in group for the next year, I'm not allowed to be in a relationship with someone in my group, the reason for that is because it would interfere with both their and my recovery, it would interfere by ...) Think through the situation (with Pros and Cons) until I feel like I'm really buying into the philosophy of no romantic relationships in group (Willingness).

\*Emotion mind: use mindfulness of my emotions to try and really identify as best I can what I'm feeling toward this person and what I'm feeling in general right now about my life and my relationships. trying to be really gracious and tolerant of all my emotions

\*And then try and put together some dialectical statements with the facts, my thoughts, and my feelings. Try to radically accept them.

\- Opposite action (all the way) -->

\*(Ok here's my humble opinion, only based on what I know my brain tries to do to me): planning to give them my number after group, while not inherently bad or unhealthy AT ALL, is probably going to keep me leaning into the thoughts and feelings I don't want to empower.

\*Maybe I can try thinking about and radically accepting that this might be a friendship that ends after group. It might not be, but I can explore how that potential outcome might make me feel, and how can I cope ahead with those feelings.

\*But for the most part, I can try to just be in the moment and not ruminate about a future relationship or lack thereof. Really lean into appreciating group, the relationships I have there (for what they are and not what they might become) and the relationship I have with myself.

Regardless of how exactly you use your skills, I want to say that it sounds like you really intend to stick with your group's rules and boundaries, and to use your skills to behave appropriately and be your best self, and I don't think I would want to hide this from my therapist. I would hope that the therapist would understand that I am not breaking group rules and that I'm actively trying to reduce unhealthy thoughts that might lead me to break rules. Maybe the therapist can help me with that goal. Maybe I want to try opposite action for the guilt and shame I might feel.

FWIW this is not uncommon in group. You’re both in vulnerable states which makes it easier to reach for connection. As others said, this can also be an avoidance behavior especially in the sense of “let me try to help them instead of myself.” Radical acceptance and opposite action are both good suggestions.

"How does it not affect your ability to participate in group? You're violating your agreement by omitting therapy-interfering behaviors.

Or if your trust isn't as good as with your individual therapist, go to them and make the action plan with them - or ask them to be a mediator between you and group therapist.

"The Johns Hopkins Hospital has one of the top psychiatry departments in the country; in my experience a good psychiatry department also means a pretty good clinical psych program. I'm not sure if they have a DBT program, but the great thing about finding an excellently trained medical professional to have on your team is that they will be able to direct you to the best quality programs in the area. If you can get a consultation with one of the doctors in the John Hopkins psych dept, they should be able to refer you to a few programs. 

Another note: I definitely recommend ""shopping"" the different programs (not necessarily attending the group sessions, but definitely meeting with the group leaders at least once and seeing if you click with them) before making a choice--personally, I feel that how much you feel comfortable makes a big difference in how effective group is. 

This is a little controversial, but personally, I care a lot about the doctor's/therapist's qualifications--what their degree is (LCSW, MA, PhD, MD, etc), if a doctor, where they did their residency, how long they've been in the practice and what sort of work they've done to get where they are, etc. A quality residency can make a *huge* difference in the way a psychiatrist approaches medication, for example. For DBT, someone trained at the University of Washington Seattle is personally a huge plus for me--that's where Marsha Linehan is located. I was fortunate enough to work with a therapist who had Linehan as her PhD advisor/clinical training lead and I personally felt there was a massive difference between her treatment quality and the treatment from someone who had gotten a DBT certification but otherwise had an LCSW. But the therapist's resume/experience definitely factors into this, so if you feel that someone technically has fewer degrees but it way more competent/you click with them better, of course you should go with that person."

"It's Wednesday my dudes!

Today is a big one for me. I am going to go to a group meeting (non DBT related) where there is a strong likelihood I will run into someone I had a falling out with a while ago, who I've been avoiding for a whole year. 

Today I am willing to feel my fear, approach my fear, and really truly do opposite action. I am quaking in my boots, but I've already told someone I'm going so I have accountability. I am literally going to write down a load of skills on some paper and have it in my pocket, cos I'm going to need to throw every skill I've got at this situation. Ok let's go!!"

I think this is a tool that would help me, but I'm not sure what I skill I should try and get better at. Since I have issues with harsh self criticism, I think it would probably have to be something that is generally measurable, other than something more abstract such as art.

"My go-to build mastery skill is exercise, since it's killing two birds with one stone--it covers a part of PLEASE and ABC. I recommend **NOT** focusing on something subjective (e.g. get more toned), but instead focus on something quantifiable that has nothing to do with your appearance/weight/etc. For example, my goal used to be a 1 mile run/walk everyday; then it turned into ""1 mile without walking,"" then it turned into ""3 mile walk/run,"" and now it also includes ""stretch for 15 minutes everyday"" and I give myself the option to do pilates instead of running, so I've also built mastery in that I've started to learn another sport. 

If exercise is very far from what you're looking for, my personal criteria for any Build Mastery skill is: accessible, has a level that's easy to master in the beginning, and cheap (unless finances aren't an issue for you). 

Examples: cooking (e.g. going from ""learning how to toast bread"" to making a meal, whether or not it tasted great, were objective levels of mastery), IDing of any sort (e.g. foraging), jigsaw puzzles/crosswords/etc (thrift stores sell puzzles for $1-5 and plenty of free crossword apps exist), anything learning related (usually there are free/cheap podcasts, youtube videos, etc. if you really wanna geek out on a subject)."

you could try a craft! it has a creative aspect which is famously great for mental well-being, and it can often have a 3-dimensional element that you can see your progress through i.e. woodworking, pottery, screen printing, embroidery, etc. a benefit is you often also are able to make nice things for yourself or as gifts, which i think absolutely satisfies a part of “mastery” which is genuine recognition.

It doesn’t have to be a DBT skill, it could be maybe a morning routine or bedtime routine.

I personally go more for the hobbies for a way to build mastery of a skill. It sounds like maybe executive functioning related skill building could be a decent option for you. Say, time management. That can help you in life. As well as be measurable based off how you wish to do skill practice. Your own framework created by you, for you. There are other skills that can be worked on within executive functioning. Type executive functioning in Google.

"If exercise is a goal, I'd start in whatever small way you can, just because it's scientifically proved as one of the best improvements for mental health save medication. I had the same line of thinking of, ""oh, my mental health needs to get better"" because I dreaded it so much, and honestly, it never got to the point that I wanted to exercise, like, ever. I think part of it was that I felt like I had to do ""proper"" exercise, like some crossfit workout--but it's totally valid to start with an ""exercise snack""--5 minutes of wrist stretches after using a computer for hours, for example, or yoga, or a walk around the neighborhood block. If you're relatively nerdy, something like ballroom or scottish dance can also be fun (I say this completely affectionately, but people who do folk dance tend to be very welcoming and very awkward if you're into that vibe, lol. You may not think this because dancing's very physical, but I knew many people with physical disabilities while dancing, such as people who needed canes, so I think they'd also be very understanding of any physical disability:) ).

I think part of what makes something a skill is what your goals/values are, so that might be another thing you might think of when creating your Build Mastery skill. For example, someone's Build Mastery skill might be learning to cook, but as someone who has had to cook for myself for over a decade, this is no longer applicable as a Build Mastery skill for me. It might be the same with you and crossword puzzles--maybe you're so good at em (which is a great thing!) that it doesn't really make sense to make it your Build Mastery skill. You're very perceptive in identifying a critical component of Build Mastery, which is: what are the things you want to get better at in life?

"What I’ve had to do with fear of abandonment in the past: 

Write down any and all emotions associated with the fear (look up the emotion chart). Write down specifically why you feel that fear. So for example “Frightened - that I will be alone” “Anxious - that I cannot prevent it”

Then pull up a “thought trap” guide and label all the thought traps and why they are thought traps. Be real and honest with yourself about all of these. So for the anxious one, if you put that, maybe it’s a control fallacy or emotional reasoning then state how you know it is that thinking trap type. 

Then write down ways you know for a fact these are simply thoughts and not reality, so as to reframe the thought pattern.

"these are the steps i go through in my head

step 1: validation of my feelings. yes, i have been hurt in the past. i have been betrayed and abandoned by many people who i thought loved me, so this is a natural response for my body and brain to be going through.

step 2: calming activity. this is mainly for impulse control, to make sure i don’t hurt myself or do or say anything that i know i don’t want to. it helps to combat the intrusive thoughts of destructive behaviour, and doing something with my hands and something gently stimulating helps me feel grounded and more present. i like to make jewelry and crochet, but this can be almost activity. i don’t recommend going on social media just because that stuff tends to just numb your brain and cause repression. 

step 3: rationalize. writing out differences between how my life used to be vs. how it is now. what are some major differences between my partner and people who have hurt me? has my partner given me a direct reason to believe that they will hurt me the way i have been hurt before? (if the answer to the second question is a yes, then you may want to reconsider your relationship)

this generally helps me. this process considers the emotional reaction that i have initially and it re-directs my thought process to one that is more rational so that i don’t lose control over myself and spiral into the negative feelings."

"Hi friends!

I am diagnosed with BPD (and Bipolar) and I am struggling to put the skills into action when I really need them.

In Wise Mind, I love DBT and see how it could be very useful! I meet with a DBT coach three times a week to get a deeper understanding and have been in a few skills groups. But once I enter emotion mind I get reptilian brain and major fight or flight. Not only do I not use any skills but I tell anyone who tries to help me with DBT to fuck off. I believe that no skill can help an emotional pain that is this severe and screw anyone who invalidates my feelings. When in Emotion Mind it is so intense it feels like I am lit on fire and DBT is asking me to stand still. It doesn't feel possible in those moments. 

I am struggling to utilize STOP, Turning The Mind and Radical Acceptance mostly because Emotion Mind me is very willful and refuses to even try. It truly feels like im possessed by an evil demon when I am in that state.

Does anyone have any experience with this? I need relief so badly but when I enter emotion mind all bets are off. Im stuck in a toxic cycle."	UpperFreshSide	post	19.02820097898854	male	White	0.9985014200210571	na	na	na	17	dbtselfhelp
"Ask about TIPP skills, they are there for bringing down high emotional states.

I found that practicing dbt skills with small (or even made up) events made it easier to access my skills when bigger ones came up. It built confidence that it can help, and each time it helped even a little it made it easier to access during higher emotional states.

"Are you familiar with the concept of SUDs? Aka, subjective units of distress. Basically it's looking at how distressed you are and ranking it from 1 to 10, where 1 is zen and 10 is the most distressed you've been in your life.

The reason I bring this up is because my DBT program taught me that I can't access all skills at all distress levels. They taught that interpersonal effectiveness is for when you're at a 1-3, emotion regulation is for 4-6, and distress tolerance is for 7-10. Using DT, for example, when at a 4 isn't effective and can change how useful DT is for you. In the opposite direction, when you're at a 8, there's no way in hell you can do DEAR MAN successfully.

I bring this up because I think what you're saying about being in emotion mind is correlating to a high distress level, based on your comments about emotional pain. So skills like radical acceptance, if you're not VERY good at them, are going to be difficult to impossible to access. I'd try focusing on distress tolerance until your SUDs drop. And when SUDs are low, practice the skills you listed so you can grow competency with them. It is really helpful to be able to use radical acceptance at high distress levels.... But it's a lot easier to practice it when it's low to make it more instinctual and therefore easier to access when distressed."

And perhaps you can coach/ask/dearman other people (while you’re calmer) to validate you in moments like that. Invalidation when you’re experiencing such intense and painful emotions would drive me berserk, too. You could ask them to say or do specific things that you find helpful.

"A lot of people are mentioning TIPP skills which are definitely a great way to cope when the emotion feels as intense as you've described it. However, I personally find it hard to do TIPP when I'm feeling resistant to DBT because of emotion mind. Like I know dunking my head in  a bowl of ice water or intense exercise will help, but that isn't easy to force yourself to do if you're doubting the usefulness of DBT. 

In this situation, I use ACCEPTS to try and get my emotional intensity down.

"I second the TIP skill. The TIP skill can bring the emotional pressure down just enough to practice a different skill that might be more applicable to your situation. 

Another suggestion I have is to do damage control with your DBT skills before your emotions get to that level in the first place. Do you keep a diary card? Maybe start keeping a diary card and have one of your trackers be which skill(s) you used each day. You'd be surprised how many skills you're already using each day without realizing it. Maybe start using them more mindfully and intentionally for optimal benefit.

"This has been an issue of mine for *years*. In every relationship whether it's platonic or romantic I always end up becoming their therapist, feel forced to ""fix them"" or I honestly just end up projecting some of my issues onto them and help them get through it. The latter is usually if we have a similar trauma/issue and by helping them with their problem I  sort of dont have to deal with my own shit. This one I am actively trying to stop and fix and have come quite far. But being the designated therapist is still a really big struggle. I can't be quiet if someone I care about is struggling and I think I might be able to help them. And it can get a bit problematic at times of it happens during a splitting episode where my reasoning becomes very black and white. It also causes friendships to become projects rather than intimate. It also causes me to not open up about myself. Most people don't seem to even notice that they don't know anything about another person?   
I know some of it is my own fault. I ask questions, I listen and I give my input. Its become so normal for me that I sometimes *look* for something to fix in another person. It's a hard pattern to break especially with the whole ""fear of abandonment"" but I hate it. It feels nice in the moment because I've helped someone but it always takes so much of me and makes me feel empty afterwards.

"I think a helpful one for this is the ""problem solving"" skill.

What is the problem? Describe the problem prompting your emotions. What makes the situation a problem? Check the facts. Make sure you have the right problem 

I think as part of this, we can ask ourselves, ""what makes this my problem?"". Something is my problem when it effects something I am responsible for, like my behaviour or my job or my personal wellbeing, or an important relationship I am in, or someone I have a duty of care for, or when something is an obstacle blocking a goal based on my wise mind values, etc.

Other people's problems may cause me to have an emotional response, but they are not my problem to solve. Not all problems need solving, either. Some problems need to be tolerated, or simply regulate our emotions towards the problem.

Maybe some more effective ways of responding (instead of trying to solve their problems), could be: practising mindfulness of your own emotions while hearing of their problems, noticing the urges these emotions give you, but not necessarily acting on those urges. Practise the non judgemental skill, and practise giving validation. Often people just want to be heard. Unless they specifically ask you for advice or some other form of help, you are not required to do anything. And you can also say no to any requests they make of you."

"Today, I practiced the opposite to emotion skill a lot. First, I got a letter in the mail saying that the car loan people had charged my bank account, despite the fact that I had already paid them by mail this month, AND I had asked them to stop all automatic payments from my bank account. I was furious, and I initially wanted to postpone calling them until tomorrow, when, hopefully, I would be feeling better. However, I decided that I might feel better if I address the issue head-on. So, I made the phone call to the car loan people. I was a total Karen on the phone and failed to use the DEARMAN skill, but hey, they're basically robbing me at this point, and they kinda deserved it. 

The phone call didn't go the way I wanted it to. I had asked to speak with a manager when I first got ahold of a representative. They refused to transfer me. Then, they told me it was up to me to fax copies of my bank statements to them as proof that I'm not behind on payments. Like I said, I was a Karen. I told the lady on the phone, ""Yall are the financial institition here. It isn't my place to do your all's bookkeeping."" However, I do plan to fax that information to them anyway tomorrow. But the phone call got worse. I asked the lady for the money recently taken out of my bank account back. She lied and said it was ""returned"" even though I have a paper from the bank proving that isn't true. 

I say all this to point out that, by the end of the day, I was highly upset and angry. However, I managed to act opposite to emotion and do face masks with my mom. Afterwards, I felt kinda better.

"[Willingness](https://gerryfisher.livejournal.com/23922.html) is a DBT skill that is taught in the [Distress Tolerance Module](https://www.reddit.com/r/dbtselfhelp/comments/zrte2/dbt_the_26_skills_listed/) that helps us tolerate intense emotions by accepting the reality of the present moment and doing what is most effective right now (even when we may not want to be effective).

Idk what to say..I just have such a hard time with this skill, I used to think radical acceptance is the hardest skill in DBT but I just can’t seem to act opposite of my emotion urge…I got better at doing that with anger and not lashing out, but I fail to do it with sadness..how am I supposed to act cheerful or react in an interested way an engage with other people when I feel like my body is so heavy and my heart is a void of aching blackness. Any tips?	yotamile	post	18.744383875401294	male	White	0.9994938373565674	na	na	na	10	dbtselfhelp
"I've had the same type of struggle with opposite action in regard to sadness.  I can't act all cheerful and happy when I'm not, & when I went over this with my therapist she understood.  So I've been using opposite action to acknowledge my sadness but push myself to participate in my life more fully.  I push myself to do the things I need to do, starting with hygiene at the start of my day.  I force myself to get out of bed & take baby steps, shower, eat & all that, & then push myself to go about whatever tasks I need to do - for me it's go to work.  But I don't pretend to be all happy & cheerful when I'm not.  It's the sluggishness & heaviness that I act in opposition of & that allows me to get more out of my days, be more mindful, present & productive, & through this effort I feel better about myself at the end of the day, although there is a pervasive sorrow that hangs over my existence.  

I don't know if this explanation helps or even makes much sense, but I definitely can relate to how you're feeling. I don't act particularly happy & I'm not a very social person but I use opposite action to engage with life instead of allowing sadness/depression to keep me stuck in my bed, in my head, hiding myself away from life."	yotamile	reply	na	na	na	0.9994938373565674	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I find Opposite Action for sadness to be really difficult. A few thoughts:

Opposite Action is only meant for when an emotion is inappropriate, too intense, or doesn't fit the situation. When you are sad and being sad is reasonable, doing opposite action isn't going to help. Mindfulness and distress tolerance can help though  

The opposite emotion of depression **isn't happiness**; it's closer to a dialectic of **inactive/active** in my opinion. For example:

**Inactive**: accepting automatic thoughts about yourself or your situation  
**Active**: challenging automatic thoughts, and checking with wise mind instead  

**Inactive**: avoiding doing things you need to do for your well-being  
**Active**: doing what you need for yourself using PLEASE skills; using wise kind to tell which areas are most important; practicing cognitive flexibility to recognize that there's more than ""didn't do it"" and ""did it perfectly"" (sometimes half ass is better than no ass)  

**Inactive**: withdrawing from stimuli, social situations, people you love, things you love to do  
**Active**: responding to these things, and doing them without the expectations of them being joyful or not  

Unfortunately, this means DBT can't remove sadness in the moment. However, it can help you reduce unnecessary suffering, and set yourself up for more positive experiences later on, and help you find a stability to allow you to address the depression more directly when you can."	yotamile	reply	na	na	na	0.9994938373565674	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
Maybe the solution I'm going to suggest isn't necessarily DBT, at least at first. But what's worked for me has been to ease into an opposite action until it feels more natural. For example, let's say I'm feeling depressed and what to shut off from the world. Maybe I can start by sending a neutral text to a close friend. I have supportive friends, so that will presumably go well. I live with my mom and step dad, so after that, I could work my way up to going downstairs and socializing with my mom. My mom is also generally supportive, so if I'm feeling really ambitious after that AND if one of my friends is available to talk, I could call one of my friends. Or, depending on the day of the week, me and my mom could play cards with our friends. It's sort of like taking baby steps and starting where you are to slowly work your way out of your comfort zone.	yotamile	reply	na	na	na	0.9994938373565674	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

That sounds like a good way of using this skill, maybe it’s perfectionism and unrealistic expectations but in group they’re saying opposite action only works if it’s all the way and like throwing yourself into it, so I’m like ok this feeling is telling me to withdraw and not respond to my partner for example and just be heavy and slow, so I should be smiling and extra bubbly and cheerful…there’s probably a middle way.	yotamile	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9994938373565674	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"The reason everyone says DBT is best in a group is because that's what the research says. DBT as it is today was developed through decades of clinical trials and the statistics show that the most effective adoption of DBT skills comes from combined group and individual therapy. 

However, statistics aren't really the end all, be all. Every statistic has a certain number of outliers. If DBT group doesn't work for you, that's OK! You should talk to your therapist about it so they can determine if you simply don't fit into this particular group, or if you truly will do better without the group, etc. etc. I will note that 4 sessions just isn't really enough time to settle.

A lot of posters added great pros for group… they said it beautifully. The only thing I’ll add, from personal experience, is that I wanted to quit group for the first 2-2.5 months. I think it’s really common to struggle in a therapy group, especially if group or 1:1 therapy is new to you, so it makes sense if you’re having a difficult time adjusting to the new setting. Personally, I gained the most traction in my treatment when I started going to a DBT group, bc the insight and learning truly came from hearing how the other group members problem solved and applied the skills. Im glad you posted here asking for advice. I hope you get the info you’re looking for to make a decision about group.

No, it doesn't need to be in a group setting, but it should be done with a therapist schooled properly in DBT. I found the group setting rough and I'm taking a break in between each module to get through it, because a group setting is just cheaper than working with an individual therapist. But I think even self-work with DBT is better than not doing the work at all. It's considered easier to practice the skills in group but I don't ascribe to the idea there's only one way to do anything, especially therapy.	raked85	reply	na	na	na	0.9995003938674927	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"I know this was posted a while ago, but I just came across this trying to find other people with similar feelings. I'm rambling and definitely projecting, but I wanted to share my thoughts/experience so far with group.

I'm really struggling with group to the point it's most likely going to become a trigger for me. The anxiety I get, the frustration, the anger I feel because of how nerve-wracking group is for me ... is bad. I've been in group for about 2-3 months. So I 100% feel you.

I think that everyone's experience is different and I wish people would make more room/empathy for folks when group is just not working. It may not be working cause of the group itself, it may not be working because of the place you're in, in your life. Group is clearly a core part of the DBT model,  I just really wish more people would allow for nuances in whatever data is out there.

I do think you can absolutely do DBT without group depending upon the skillset of your therapist.

That said -- I'm not advocating for dropping or staying. The only thing I will say to you and anyone who comes across this is -- before you commit to, pay for, sign ANYTHING related to DBT -- know your options if you need out. I'm being forced to stay in group in order to keep my individual therapist, or else I lose care all together apparently.

There are also a lot of good vids by the mindful movement on YouTube (15 minutes or less playlist) that talk about accepting the wandering mind (moreso with meditation and this still applies to everyday life, too), which ties into radical acceptance in an indirect way, meaning it might be better to accept that you can't control what associations your brain makes with anything

Similar to the comment above mine, more suffering/distraction/distress comes from fixating on the belief that you can or should control your thoughts.

I know it was really bad, but in the moment I was beyond upset. We’ve just been having these issues these past few weeks but we barely started dating. I just can’t ruin this because he’s amazing. I need help and I’m becoming depressed because why can’t I control my strong feelings? I need help and DBT is not working for me.

"Hi OP, 

I'm sorry you've been having a hard time. I think many here know that feeling of knowing you're sabotaging something good and not being able to stop yourself despite knowing. 

I know you say that DBT doesn't work for you, but please remember that sometimes, DBT therapy can take years depending on your ability to implement skills and the quality/intensity of your program. I think there are a few DBT skills you can keep in mind. 

The first are interpersonal skills, especially GIVE. It seems that you're lashing out at your partner when you don't want to, and GIVE will provide the framework to approach him with kindness. I think secondarily, you may want to use FAST as well--the way you're acting clearly doesn't align with your values, and FAST will provide the framework to allow you to maintain self respect in your interpersonal relationships. 

Second, it's clear that you're in distress when you lash out, so I'd also make use of STOP whenever you feel like you're going to lash out at him. Skills such as half smiling willing hands will also allow you to approach him with willingness instead of willfulness. 

Sort of building on that, I think you may be putting your partner on a pedestal from your comment, ""I can't ruin this because he's amazing."" I think that thinking your partner is the best thing that's happened to you is typical black and white thinking that can only lead to disappointment whenever he's not perfect. Similarly, a relationship either being perfect or ruined is also splitting. I'd practice dialectics and remind yourself that your partner is only an imperfect human being, and a relationship is a journey and an experiment that you're doing together, and not some sort of test. 

Finally, one of the best pieces of advice I got recently is to ""give myself permission to be cheered up."" I think a lot of people for whom DBT is useful have ""sticky"" emotions, and negative ones affect us for a long time. Whether it because your partner didn't know the perfect way to react to you or because you feel like he's not understanding your misery, I think a big skill I had to learn was to understand he was trying his best and accept that. This is another form of dialectics--this isn't really something you were explicitly having trouble with in your post, but I hope you find it helpful. 

I hope some of this was useful. It could totally be that your birth control is messing with you (as a bipolar person, I was advised against hormonal birth control because it makes bipolar worse), but you can still use skills--they can make you feel slightly less awful than before, even if you don't feel great."		reply	na	na	na	0.9950768351554871	strong	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

I recently called my grandma. To see if she could give me one thing from her, and one thing from my late grandpa to remember them by. When she eventually passed away. She agreed, and was kind and caring about what we discussed. I had to get off the phone call because I could tell I was going to cry. So, I got off the phone and cried. I did check to see if my emotional response was effective. I think it was? I used to almost never cry unless frustrated. Now I cry much more frequently, and for more emotions than only frustration. What are any of your opinions guys? On crying I mean, plus the emotions involved.	Interesting-Sample99	post	22.41347763801818	male	White	0.012624342925846577	na	na	na	2	dbtselfhelp
"Honestly, it's hard to tell you if an emotion is justified without being you and being able to grasp the myriad factors involved. Determining if you're effective/justified is something only you can do by developing your wise mind. 

That being said, I don't think crying a lot is necessarily a bad thing (again, can't tell you for sure because I don't know the facts). For me I couldn't feel anger forever because I grew up in a very abusive household where a family member tried to kill me multiple times. I learned that anger kills and never allowed myself to feel it, which meant I was a massive pushover and pessimist. Learning how to feel angry was a hard skill for me to learn, and I was profoundly disturbed when I started feeling and processing it for the first time. You might be going through a similar thing with sadness. I'd just try to practice going through it mindfully.

I'm struggling with food. I use food for love and it is affecting my body. I have tried lovingkindness towards myself many times for years and I don't feel any love.

"Hey OP, I also struggle with an eating disorder and I think there are a few things going on. The first is that 

>I use food for love and it is affecting my body.

This indicates to me that your problem with food isn't necessarily because you hate yourself, but rather because food is a *coping mechanism*. So the food and self love are actually separate problems if that makes any sense.

For the food issue, I think the first step is to **stop using food when you need to feel love**. Replace it with a coping mechanism listed in the distress tolerance module, or a pleasant event/activity from the Accumulating positive emotions of the ABC skill. When you're upset, you can decide to talk to a friend instead, or practice a hobby (knitting, painting, creative writing, gardening, etc), or even something as simple as a mindfulness exercise. 

Another useful exercise is to be mindful when you eat. This is honestly the hardest skill for me, because every time I eat, I'm just so overwrought with shame and guilt that the last thing I want to do is face that. But being able to radically accept how you feel and experience it without judgment is the first step to being able to be mindful when you eat, and therefore not lose control when you do so. It might also lead you to realize that maybe you're not actually that hungry, or the emotion will be better solved by another activity, etc. and hopefully eventually get you to the point where you may be able to free yourself from judgment when eating and problem solve the root issues of your emotional eating. 

As for the self-love, I have to admit that it's really hard. I've been in therapy for around a decade and DBT for over 4 years, and I still don't love myself. If loving kindness doesn't work, I suggest focusing on ABCs and mindfulness/evaluation of goals and values. Personally, the more I feel I'm living in line with my values, the better I feel about myself, and it becomes a little easier to accept myself for who I am. 

Best of luck on this journey. An unhealthy relationship with food is a very hard demon to fight because you have to eat. I admire your tenacity in tackling it and hope you can find what works best for you!"	foolishspirit	reply	na	na	na	0.9992076754570007	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Something I tried is talking to myself as if I were talking to a friend with loving kindness and going from there. It seems like an odd, mental gymnastics kind of thing but as someone who is still in recovery from an ED, it helped to leave myself kind notes and reminders from ""a friend"" or trying to be more mindful with that loving kindness overall. Making sure I wasn't doing anything else while practicing whatever it was (slowly saying phrases to myself from said ""friend"" or very deliberately and slowly having a mindful meal of something I usually enjoyed) was a big help, acting surprised when I'd find the little reminders or taking long moments to say what I appreciated about the food via my senses instead of either fixating on certain aspects of it that were harmful."	foolishspirit	reply	na	na	na	0.9992076754570007	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Here is a re-frame that may be worth a try: instead of thinking in terms of loving yourself, you could try loving 'being' yourself. I picked this up from a Tumblr post via Pinterest lol. The gist of the post is -- by focusing on loving yourself, you're treating yourself as an object that you're viewing from an outside perspective. You are trying to use DBT skills to change your feelings or thoughts about yourself as an object. But by focusing on loving being yourself, you are now the subject and you can use DBT skills to change your actions to create a ... life worth living, which is one of the goals of DBT! 

Don't know if this will work but [here is a link to the image](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/06/41/c5/0641c5c07c3ec151ce6cf3e4af5a119e.jpg). 

Another re-frame that might be useful is aiming towards self-neutrality, rather than self-love or self-hate. I often found myself reacting negatively to messages from the body positivity movement, but when I heard the term body neutrality, it immediately resonated with me and brought me a greater sense of calm.

"I think you are kind of getting it wrong here because you are trying to replace CONNECTION with others with a feeling of self-care. The truth is we need BOTH to be happy and well and they do not substitute for each other. Even if you have all the self-love in the world, you will feel lonely and isolated if you do not having caring relationships with others.

When you are dealing with feelings of loneliness and isolation, I would do an examine the feelings (I forgot the DBT terms) - what am I feeling? What is the reason? Are there actions I can/should take to handle this? In this case, the answer may be yes, you can solve some of the problem - call or text a friend or family member, cuddle your pet, etc.

Another option is to accumulate pleasant experiences re: accumulate experiences of connection. How can you meet your connect needs? Can you build more social time into your calendar, eg a standing coffee date with a friend or a regular phone date with a friend who lives far away?

Emotional outbursts (including BPD episodes) do take a up both a lot of energy and executive dysfunction. It could be possible that your desire to move or “be productive” could subconsciously be rooted in capitalism too, however it also makes that staying in the frozen state least to the BPD symptom of emptiness. 

The small steps seems like a really good route to go, as well as radical acceptance of your reality. My personal recommendations for being in the frozen state would be to try listening to music, if you can? Sometimes music can help regulate oneself. It’s also ok to listen to songs on repeat, if that’s what you need at the moment. Another recommendation is getting up for a glass of water *and* going to the bathroom if you need to? That way you are doing 2 things at once, *and* both of them are taking care of yourself. It is a lot easier to stay hydrated when you have a glass of water right next to you #smallsteps. My last recommendation would be to practice self-validation? You don’t really need to be “moving” to practice self-validation, and validating yourself could give you something healthier to focus on than experiencing shame (which I think is blaming yourself)."

You can try popping a strong mint in your mouth and really focusing on the taste and feel and smell of the mint one-mindfully, or sucking on a lemon or sour candy.

"Here are some things that work for me, although not all of them work all the time. They all have brain chemistry in common. They shock the chemicals back into balance. You need your natural biology back in balance. Thoughts won't do it. Use what you got: your biology. 

\- Long walks. Bundle up, get headphones, and walk for at least an hour (preferably until you're exhausted).

\- 400mg of Sam-E and a Vit B pill.

\- A cold shower, or visit to a cold pool. Book a hotel if you have to and spend the evening in the water.

\- Cold exposure/therapy. Turn the thermostat down to 60, and exist in your underwear as long as you possibly can. Like, all day. You want shivers.

\- Small dose of Adderall if you can get it. No depressants (alcohol or weed).

Long term, I have found my mood to be MUCH more stable when I'm on this routine:

1. Weight training 3 days a week, to a 10/10 effort level. (I have set of Bowflex 552 at home)
2. Cardio in the 70% heart rate zone. I go incline walking, and wear a monitor to keep my heart at 70% of max for 30 - 40 minutes, about 3x/week. (used professional gym quality treadmills are often free, I would never buy a non-pro treadmill)
3. A stack of dopamine boosters: rhodiola, theanine, ginkgo, ashwaganda, and krill oil. Every day.

It takes a strong defense to create a ""fitness zone"" but I will defend it with my life. I would probably get divorced, fired, and kicked out of my house before sacrificing my fitness routine. That's how much it matters to me, and my sanity. Without it, I'm borderline suicidal.  I don't spend a ton of money on it, but I'll spend every penny it deserves.

"The best thing you can do is accept that you threw a fit and go back and decide what went wrong and when it went wrong and think about what you should have done instead. For example if your fit started because of a triggering comment that made you insecure you should have recognized that you felt insecure and addresses that feeling instead of lashing out in anger. The next thing you should do if you have a relationship to repair is apologize to whoever you lashed out on and explain to them what went wrong and how you plan on reacting differently in the future. For example “I let something that made me feel insecure come out as defensive anger, I recognize this is a problem I have and that my insecurities are my own to deal with, not yours, and I apologize for how I treated you. In the future I’m going to work on recognizing those triggers and putting them to bed without becoming so defensive.”

When you’re working on DBT it’s not an instant fix, you’re gonna fuck up a lot while you’re learning new coping skills and when you do it’s best to not punish yourself and instead to just recognize what you should have done instead and move on.

I was toying with the idea of doing it myself, but I'm not a therapist. I've been in DBT for over 5 years now, still in group, still 1 on 1 therapy, and a psychiatrist. Most of the time I'm helping the group leader explain the book to others. I thought maybe I could help the BPD community. It would be free, as both platforms are free to watch."

"While I think you have great intentions and applaud your compassion and willingness to help others, I **strongly discourage you from doing this**. Peer-led therapy is not a thing for a reason--while it sounds great in practice, there are lots of dangers and group dynamics that you're not able to handle without proper training.

If you really want to do something like this, maybe you can produce videos explaining each concept and uploading them, and going through some examples, etc. with warnings that you don't have a license and that you're producing this content as a DBT enthusiast in hopes that others will find this useful.

Managing a therapy group is **much more intensive** than you think it is. How are you going to manage group dynamics? What are you going to do if a group member is suicidal or otherwise engaging in self-harm? Additionally, by leading the group, you are inherently in a position of **power**. What are you going to do if someone gets attached to you? In a traditional therapist setting, the therapist needs to be available in times of an emergency. It is a professional requirement because therapy often **necessitates** crises as we process our past. **How will you respond when a member is in crisis**? You don't have to ability to reach out to the proper resources and legally communicate with doctors/hospitals/etc.

In addition, there's a matter of the group dynamics itself. Basically, a trained group facilitator will know how to make sure that people aren't hogging too much time/space without invalidating the people who talk too much, know how to resolve interpersonal conflict, draw the line on how personal people can get, etc. Without that training, there's always the danger you'll run into difficulties. How are you going to make sure you don't hog too much time? Leading group therapy is largely about listening to other people and repeating what they say in a DBT framework. Do you have the listening skills to do this? Additionally, what are you going to do if two people start dating, and then break up? Which one of them is allowed to stay in the group? These are not examples I'm pulling out of nowhere--these are very common problems that group therapists get **trained to address**.

This is especially pertinent because we know scientifically that people with BPD have the tendency to get very attached to people and certain aspects of their lives. It's not that this won't start off great--honestly, it might start off fabulously. The problem is that there will inevitably be **interpersonal conflict,** which is something that BPD symptoms notoriously exacerbate. The question is whether **people will come out more traumatized when that happens than when they come in**.

As I said, if you want to do something like this, maybe you can make it more one-sided so that it's not exactly a therapy group. It's not that the spreading of information is dangerous (though you should provide a disclaimer every video that you don't have a license). It's that the **therapy** part of it is something that you're not equipped to address.

I apologize in advance if this sounds harsh--I hope I provided other options that may sound appealing to you. It's just that peer led therapy is explicitly discouraged for a reason, and I want to make very clear why it's not a thing in the professional world. It's not just a matter of elitism--it's to prevent people coming out of the experience worse than before."	Christeenabean	reply	na	na	na	0.007726375013589859	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

I genuinely don't see how a peer based group therapy could work for people with BPD. It seems to me they would benefit the most from DBT with individual sessions with a therapist.

All of your points have merit. As I'm not a clinical psychologist I know I shouldn't be running a focused group therapy session. I hadn't fleshed everything out as well as you just did, but my thought was more like going through the book than anything else. A live version of the skills training that people can come back to as a community. I thought giving people access to the skills training would help people, and especially considering how dire things can get for those of us who are significantly dysregulated and how hard it is to get the diagnosis much less the therapy. When you do a live stream there isn't a ton of time for replying to people individually, so moderators typically chime in and provide helpful links to other places if they're needed.

Unfortunately I just don't think peer-led therapy is necessarily the right way to go about it because of the responsibilities it entails. Live streaming worries me a bit because it's a breeding ground for parasocial relationships, but if you think of a way to discourage that or distance yourself from your audience/emphasize information dissemination rather than community, I think that it might work. I honestly think that's why this subreddit works--I never notice if I interact with the same usernames, and we're all focused on disseminating DBT information, which means we can all care about the information rather than the interpersonal relationships (which is an inherent part of a therapy group dynamic).

"Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from--5 months ago I relapsed into an eating disorder I hadn't had for 8 years and for a while, I felt so ugly I refused to let myself outside--I felt bad that people might catch a glimpse of me and I'd ruin their day with how awful I looked. Even now the only way I can bear to get out of the house is with makeup. 

There are a few skills I think are useful. The first is loving kindness toward yourself (and others if that's applicable). [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dbtselfhelp/comments/yhluik/made_a_few_posters_to_put_on_my_wall_sharing_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) is a poster I made for myself if you struggle coming up with phrases to repeat. If you love yourself, you can accept that you are lovable to others as well. Along the same veins, I think half smiling and willing hands is also really useful. I would encourage you *not* to radically accept that you're ugly--instead, radically accept that *at this moment*, you are going through a particularly hard time. Accepting that you feel this way then allows you to stop focusing on that feeling itself, and instead approach the rest of life with a half smiling attitude. 

In terms of intrusive thoughts, on a short term, distress tolerance level, STOP is probably the go to skill, and maybe DISTRACT and IMPROVE and all those skills as well. If you feel that your mind is able to do this, checking the (positive) facts may be useful as well--like the fact you still have friends, remembering a time someone called you pretty, etc etc.

I hope some of these prove useful. If anyone else has ED experience, I welcome them to chime in--I don't know if I'm the best voice on this topic considering I'm still struggling with this, haha."	beachhouse404	reply	na	na	na	0.9912125468254089	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

Great suggestions already. I'd add adding sensory mindfulness+loving kindness and finding parts of your body that do feel good/strong/functional/beautiful. Spread from there.

"Mindfulness of current thoughts could help. Also, this isn't DBT, but are you doing a lot of ""checking,"" such as looking in the mirror to ""check"" how you look, taking selfies, comparing yourself to others online, etc.? All of those things might possibly reduce anxiety in the short-term, but they will teach your brain that these worries are important and then your brain will throw up even more of these thoughts and make your anxiety even worse. It can help to cut out any checking compulsions and do something you value instead. I struggle with similar issues, it sucks."	beachhouse404	reply	na	na	na	0.9912125468254089	no	no	strong	na	dbtselfhelp
"To piggy back off this (because this is a great response!), radically accepting that you ARE a beautiful and worthy human being (loving kindness) while radically accepting that at this moment in time/life, you are being really unnecessarily hard on yourself. And radically accepting that you can begin to grow and develop your self love little by little, even if it’s a slow-to-start process.

I have been battling with dermatillomania for 10 years now. I relate to your post SO hard when I read it. The last three years, I had no photos of my face, and I only wanted to be inside to avoid people seeing me. I couldn’t even look myself in the mirror without breaking down it tears and self hatred. I did the above paragraph with myself for the past year as I started DBT, and it worked literal wonders for me… after 10 years, I have finally made it a few months of progress with my habits and self love and while I still have a lot of work to do, I would say that DBT skills were the reason I was able to make a huge step in my life.

"Hi, I would really appreciate anything that helped anyone else with this. I have a very deeply engrained compulsion to ruminate. It’s not always triggering or anxiety thought loops but I’ll get caught ruminating about good things in my life too. I ruminate when I fall in love or meet new friends. The problem is I start going and it doesn’t stop for hours. I can ruminate for days just lost in my head. I’ve been using skills like mindfulness to bring me back to the moment, but the compulsion and urge is so strong. I think part of my reason for ruminating is just not being able to really let out my excitement. So any recommendations on healthy outlets? Please I need to do my homework.

Update: 
A combination of the STOP skill and mindfulness helped bring me back in the moment. Also reminding myself to be in the present as it is not holding onto anything (past/future) will help me live my life more fully and willingly. I had to CONSTANTLY bring myself back and I wasn’t always nonjudgmental about it. It took a lot of effort, but I got some homework done. Still struggling with shutting this stupid thing off (brain) at night when I gotta sleep. Thank you to all for the support and suggestions. I’m hoping the hard work I put in today will make tomorrow easier."	slut_bottle	post	25.089590162207998	female	White	0.00650652265176177	na	na	na	6	dbtselfhelp
Radical acceptance about what you are ruminating about, experimenting with different ways to express your emotions (dancing, jumping, screaming into a pillow, crying, drawing, etc). Maybe a reward system to help your hw get done?	slut_bottle	reply	na	na	na	0.00650652265176177	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"This is a technique from meta-cognitive therapy I think but I’ve found it helpful. Maybe you could give it a try if it sounds interesting to you:

Plan your ruminating time. Set a half hour or however long you think appropriate aside every day which is dedicated to ruminating. 
When thoughts come up during the day, tell yourself that you will get into that during the allotted time and use your mindfulness skills to guide your attention back to the present. 

When the time has come, set a timer and get ruminating. Once the timer rings, use your mindfulness skills again and come back to the present. 

This can help to stop the rumination intruding into all aspects of your life uncontrolledly while still giving those thoughts and feelings space to exist.

"I only have three weeks left in my DBT group before I graduate after a year, and the closer I get, the more sad I am becoming. I greatly value that space because I feel so seen and understood. I don't have any friends or anyone outside of group and individual therapy where I feel understood, so to not have group anymore will be very hard on me. 

I have had a really rough few days where I had a skills breakdown, and I find myself in a headspace where I am wondering if learning skills has been worth it. It's like the more skillful I become, the less patience there is for me when I make a mistake. I feel like I am still misunderstood, and if using my skills isn't getting me closer to being understood, then what even is the point of putting in all this effort?  I want to be understood more than anything. If the outcome doesn't change at the end of the day, why do I continue to put forth this effort?  

Is there a skill that I can use to challenge this narrowed perspective I find myself in? Or, can anybody relate? Please help me zoom out :("	Alainasaurous	post	20.084107827891366	female	White	0.9948689937591553	na	na	na	15	dbtselfhelp
"Hey pal, I find practising making some dialectical statements of contradicting things that are true can really help with maneuvering out of rigid perspectives. 

For example: 

I have learned a lot of skills, AND I have more to learn.

My skills have helped me solve problems, AND I still have problems I don't know how to solve

I feel understood by the people from skills group, AND I wish more people understood me

I'm doing the best I can do right now, AND there are ways I could do better

I have put in a lot of effort and become more skillful, AND I may need to continue to put in effort

Also, some other ways to practise being dialectical are embracing change. Your skills group is ending and that's a big change. Change can bring up challenging emotions, and you can validate those emotions. Sometimes it helps me to just observe the uncertainty of change. Eg. ""This change is happening, and I don't know what's going to happen next. And that's okay""

And one other thing. It's really okay to still be learning and still making mistakes. We are all human and we are learnings our whole lives long. There's no point where we stop learning things. If you find you become impatient with yourself, I would gently suggest considering whether that is effective, and if it's not, opposite action of being patient and gentle with yourself.

"I had a similar feeling this past year after a rough situation, although not about dbt skills, just in general. ""I've spent the past four years trying to be a better person and what has it gotten me? Walked all over and just as depressed and lonely as when I started"". I gave up. Relapsed really hard back into drinking. Stopped trying to control my reactions. Things spiraled out of control so quickly. But the one bit of good that came out of it was seeing how much of a difference it really made. How far I had come and how much more I liked the person I had become over who I used to be. It can be hard to see but I'm sure it's the same for you. 

As far as being understood, people are holding you to a higher standard because they see the changes too. They expect more from you because they know you can do better. That's a good thing! It may not always be fair, mistakes happen and that's okay. But it shows progress. You have to keep in mind even if you do everything perfectly it's not always going to work. The only person we have control of is ourselves. Some people aren't going to understand us no matter what we do or how well we explain it. What it is doing for sure though is putting you in a better place to make connections with people who will. To form healthy relationships where you not only recieve it, but you're in a mindset to be able to give it too. That's a beautiful thing and yes it's worth it imo.

"Do you *want* to work on putting yourself out there?

That's the first question. You might not be ready, and that'd be fine too. Like, if I'm being helpful today I can recommend Maslow's hierarchy of needs (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs) as a general reference guide.

With some vulnerabilities we kind of need to work with what we've got in terms of the base of the pyramid, and with some idiosyncrasies we have to build on self-compassion rather than expect understanding from (most) others - just by virtue of our rarity, I feel.

Like, if you're feeling unsure going towards self-actualization that'd be natural, even if everything else were taken care of, but also where there's anxiety there's an excuse for self-care and that can mean shoring up your foundations...

I've been doing some future planning. I have a fascination with the nutritional aspect of food and recently had an epiphany, where I decided I wanted to become a dietitian at some point in the future. My therapist thought it was a great idea! Then, I've decided that once I'm a dietitian for a few years and have gotten out of some of my debt and am financially stable, I'd like to plan a trip to Japan. I've always wanted to visit there, and no one in my family (except my step dad) has ever been outside the US. It'd be a unique experience, for sure! I get all giddy just thinking about it! Like, I feel a sense of purpose thinking about all this stuff. Does this help anyone else?	ellijustice	post	30.602139955716577	male	White	0.00153397920075804	na	na	na	13	dbtselfhelp
I would argue you could say it’s DBT!

I think goal setting is DBT. Plus having something to look forward to, like a trip to Japan, is a great idea.

Fun fact, I also finished my bachelor's degree with a 3.89 GPA, which is pretty good to me. As for traveling to Japan, I've wanted to go there ever since I was a teenager. I just gave up on the idea, because I saw it as a hopeless pipe dream.

"I have BPD and I was pretty toxic towards my bf many times during the 3 years we have been dating.

I struggled af with communication and it created a wall between us because when we had any small disagreement and he wanted to talk it out, I would take it as an attack and get defensive when he was just trying to do the right thing.

When he needed me the most, I acted very rude and cold towards him. And I can’t even explain why the fuck I did that, I have no excuse for it. Not that it would make it better but at least I would have an explanation.

I've been working on communication and toxic shit,  I think I made a good progress but I just feel so much guilt from the past. Because this progress doesn't change how I acted before.  

We talked about these things, I apologized and he said “the past is the past and we can’t change it but we don’t have to dwell on it” but I can’t stop thinking about all the shit I put him through. Whenever I feel sad I think about everything once again and I can’t stop crying.

I don't want to keep bringing up these things and apologise whenever I feel bad for it again, because it's selfish. I'm doing it for me and by doing that, I’m making him remember those hurtful times and feel sad again.

And I just don't know what I'm supposed to do."	ElenaSalander	post	22.6379626032593	female	White	0.9980772733688354	na	na	na	10	dbtselfhelp
I could have written this post myself. I have been working on coming to terms with my past, harmful behaviors, too. I would give anything to get a second chance at this whole parenting thing. The mistakes I made hurt immensely when I think about them and their outcomes. For me, when I feel so guilty, I use radical acceptance, emphasis on practicing non-judgmental thoughts. To radically accept my past is what will help me be mindfully present for my family now, because you're right; unfortunately, we cannot change the past, but we can choose how we go out into our world each day.  So, I choose to be present. And, over time, this has been paying off for me. My daughter came to me for help the other day. She always goes to my husband first, but she came to me first this time. I hope you are able to extend some kindness and understanding to yourself. We've all done toxic shit, but toxic people don't engage in the level of self reflection that you do and try to use skills to be the version of themselves.

"I feel this. I tanked my previous relationship because I didn't have my own mental illness managed, and conflict made me so upset that we could never resolve anything. It scares me that I don't remember most of it either -- my body was in survival mode under immense stress, so I'm missing huge chunks of time. 

Months after we broke up, we met to talk, I apologized, and he didn't accept my apology. 

Self compassion around this is still really hard. I look back on those years and remind myself that every behavior was the result of a need trying to be met. I lacked emotional maturity and coping skills, I was struggling with low income and physical health issues, etc. 

To move forward I turn that guilt into something productive. I know I didn't ruin the relationship all by myself, so I made a list of what I wished I'd done differently (mostly behavioral things) and what I wished my ex had done differently (mostly communication things). I am resolved not to make the same mistakes twice. 

When I feel like trash about it, I go hug my current partner and thank him for his kindness and compassion (as the saying goes, ""stop saying sorry and start saying thanks""). I continue to make my priorities very clear and we check in regularly about what is making us happy and what we need more of. We've been together for more than 5 years now and it's the best relationship I've ever had. I will never get closure with my ex, but I will be a better partner going forward. 

Early stages of this realization included a lot of checking the facts and basic distress tolerance. Nowadays, it's a lot of mindful self compassion exercises and asking my ""wise mind"" (I hate that phrase) what I really want to do with these emotions of guilt, anger, and regret. I want to be better! I intentionally redirect that energy into time, sacrifice, and devotion to the relationships I didn't lose."

"I was a messy dater for a while. Wasn't very communicative, and procrastinated when I knew I had to reject someone. I couldn't figure out if I was looking for friendship, companionship, romance, sex, or just new places to go. I was depressed, grieving, angry, adrift. It wasn't wasted time per se, since I still learned a lot about dating and what I wanted in a partner. 

A mantra that helped a lot was ""the antidote to despair is action."" Kind of like opposite action, except I didn't know what that was until years later. For example, one thing I failed to do in my last relationship was my share of housekeeping. I was working 72 hours a week and constantly cleaning up after other people; I didn't *want* to do more cleaning when I was exhausted at home, and that put too much of the burden on my partner.  When guilt about that failure piled up, I would direct it toward cleaning my own living space while I lived alone. If I was too depressed to clean my own apartment, I'd message a friend and go do their dishes or something. There's definitely a penance aspect to it, but it's also helped me build better habits and relationships.

"Hi all,

One thing I find frustrating is the lack of resources out there for people who experience Narcolepsy and the effects it has emotionally/mentally. I was wondering if anyone else here experiences it and what DBT skills they have found the most useful? Not to treat the neurological symptoms as such but how to cope with the effects being perpetually sleep deprived, hallucinations etc bring. One I’ve found useful is ABC PLEASE. 

If you don’t know about narcolepsy, the best way to describe it is a circadian rhythm “disorder”. it affects a lot of things mentally and physically, with a focus on sleep stages not regulating properly."	tucktuck101	post	42.505968191328776	male	White	0.005917020607739687	na	na	na	2	dbtselfhelp
Hey there, not DBT theory but have you heard of spoon theory? It’s a technique developed for people with chronic pain/fatigue to plan out their energy for the day. Might help out in ur situation. :)	tucktuck101	reply	na	na	na	0.005917020607739687	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Spoon theory is great for managing the fatigue practically but emotionally it’s not helpful. I’m sure a lot of people diagnosed with a sleep condition would agree that being sleep deprived for an extended period of time has a mental health impact. 

A lot of narcoleptics are diagnosed with mental health disorders or experience anxiety and depression. It definitely takes a toll on relationships etc because half the time I don’t have the energy for social etiquette. A big part of narcolepsy is type 2, where people experience cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone) episodes triggered by emotions. I was given CBT therapy to help with it but was told it by my s/o it turned me into an emotionless robot 😬

After a recent intense bout of depression and anxiety a psychiatrist I briefly saw said my medical history indicates I might have BPD and recommended I look into DBT therapy. What I’ve taught myself has helped to a point...
One thing that’s the hardest for me to deal with is the hypnogogic hallucinations. They synch with my senses and happen while I am in the middle of my day. I.e I was in hospital recently and swear I heard my wife screaming at the top of her lungs at a security guard to let her come see me after visiting hours. I asked a nurse and they said no one was there.

Between things like that and what’s referred to as a “reduced quality of life” it’s difficult to manage relationships and regulate the emotional responses to things. 😮‍💨"	tucktuck101	follow-up	na	na	na	0.005917020607739687	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"I never thought about it this way--thank you! This is a really useful way of framing things. 

For OP, I want to validate that unlike other intense emotions, I personally agree that DBT doesn't provide an ""opposite action plan"" or a guide out of numbness the way it does with, for example, anger. I think part of it is that numbness is actually probably a dissociative disorder, which is a complex coping mechanism that can't be solved with a simple opposite action or other problem solving skill. Personally, I find that the ""opposite action"" of numbness is mindfulness, but perhaps other people with dissociative symptoms can chime in as well."	_smol_jellybean_	reply	na	na	na	0.9903817772865295	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Hi yes comorbid DID and BPD person here, so I spend a lot of time trying to wrangle DBT to get it to work for extreme dissociation. 

I agree with you about mindfulness being an opposite action for numbness.

This is my perspective: I see DBT as a very gradual way of slowly building up my tolerance and willingness to feel emotions in the present. I have been dissociating from pretty much every difficult emotion for decades. It's so automatic at this point. When an emotion is triggered, I have a split second to notice it before it gets buried and gets lost in the DID amnesia sludge. 

With practice, I am starting to be able to make that split second a full second, then a few seconds, etc. For me, the crucial element to this has been breath and body awareness. I practise Tai Chi, which has many other elements to it but is essentially a type of mindful movement. I have to do mindfulness with my whole body.

Little by little, I then start to notice the feelings in my body, the thoughts that come with them. Then I can start to label them. ""Oh, that was anger"" or ""oh, that's shame"". Now I call them my friends. My friend, sadness, is here. Now my friend envy is here. Etc. Now I have emotions that I can work with.

Doing skills like check the facts helps a LOT with bringing extreme emotions that are usually from dissociated child parts reacting to the present, back into reality. Little by little, this fact checking builds up a kind of trust and resilience in my ability to recover from emotional pain. 

Don't get me wrong, I am still numb a large amount of the time, but it's getting less and less. You can't just blast the numbness away. In my case, the numbness has been a vital survival mechanism all these years that unfortunately is now maladaptive. In some areas of my memory, whole parts of my life are blocked off by fog. For a good reason. if I were to feel all the emotion there, it would be destabilising.

It's little bit at a time. You get stronger at being able to feel your emotions, you can slowly chip away at the numbness."	_smol_jellybean_	reply	na	na	na	0.9903817772865295	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

When it comes to everything else, you need time to develop your intuition. That’s why practicing your DBT skills and delaying any especially volatile reactions you may have is important. Over time your brain will curate what makes sense versus what doesn’t, and on top of the fact that once your DBT skills is something you practice so much it becomes second nature, your intuition will feel much more natural and way less reflexive.

"So I (23 F) don't know how it started and I don't know why I always do it. But lately, I realised that I had slept with every guy in my life and as a small-town Indian girl it's a matter of shame 
There were times when I had sex with guys I disgust by only thinking of them. I am not a sex addict, I don't like doing it, I don't like people looking at me like slut 
But I don't know why I keep doing it 
I think it's because I feel alone and I constantly crave someones in my life 
In the beginning, I believe that its the guys they just force me to do this and since I am a people pleasure I can do anything they want 
But lately, I realized that it's me, I always drive every conversion in that direction 
I really need help, please suggest me something and give your openions"	Ok-Copy1322	post	5.395731004268317	male	White	0.9893639087677002	na	na	na	9	dbtselfhelp
"There’s a BPD recovery podcast on Spotify called “Back From The Borderline” and there was an episode that talked about something similar to this. I recommend checking out and listening to the podcast. A good first step is obviously awareness! That’s good that you notice you tend to start direction the conversation to go a certain way. Something that may help for in-general people pleasing is focusing on yourself. Do you actually want to do something? Do you have the energy for it? Would you rather be doing something else? 
Something that I currently struggle with is setting boundaries😅. So idk if you feel like people have an “expectation” from you, or if you have some sort of “reputation,” but if you do then boundary setting may be another good thing to work on"	Ok-Copy1322	reply	na	na	na	0.9893639087677002	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Possibly but I’m not sure. If you kind of operate on the assumption that people/men? want sex from you, and you give them sex, then that could be people pleasing. And also, at the same time if you understand that not everyone/men want sex, or that the people who you are having sex with include one night stands type of deal/strangers/people who you will have a superficial relationship and never see again, then it could also be that what you are doing is not necessarily rooted in people pleasing. Example, usually I feel like it’s more common to people please with people in your life, so they like you and are less likely to abandon you. I feel like it’s not as important to people please with strangers since the relationship will probably remain superficial since they aren’t apart of your life. 
In the podcast episode I referenced earlier, the speaker talks about all the sex being related to intimacy and and being accepted/valued in an extremely intimate way, so maybe your experience is more related to that? Let me see if I can find the link to the podcast. Ok here it is: https://open.spotify.com/show/1woEZZf9vqRufdPbUBFtuo?si=Y3qsZ-doQTiBqKspHB71Gg

I’m also asexual so that’s why I mentioned the part about you possibly understanding that not all people (including not all men) want sex, example people who are indifferent to the idea of sex exist, as well as people may be sex-repulsed.

Hi all, what DBT skills work for you when you just want to stay in bed all day when you know it's not good for your mental state, and there are things you need/want to do that you know will help you but you just feel stuck?

Maybe opposite action or developing a routine or raising your emotional baseline. Sometimes music helps me get out of bed and also sometimes rest is important and it is ok to rest. Sometimes needing to be productive 100% of the time can be rooted in capitalism too. But yeah not totally sure what would be best for you	tired_turnip_	reply	na	na	na	0.005251044407486916	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Totally agree with a routine as well as opposite action all the way 

I struggle with this too and so I make sure I have to get out to have a cup of tea regardless of what time it is I make it to standing - then when I’m in the kitchen I often use the temperature of TIPP or even the submerging “dive reflex” distress tolerance skill (forget the name of it) to reset my nervous system. The mornings were often hard for me as a child, so I also radically accept that it’s hard for me to get up and I’m doing my best.

"I agree with what the others said about opposite action. To expand on that, maybe assess why it is that you're wanting to lay in bed all day. Is it because you're sad? Are you avoiding something or someone? Maybe face those things gradually or as openly as you're ready. 

I've been doing a lot of opposite action myself. Today, I didn't feel like talking to anyone, and I wanted to sit in my room and watch YouTube all day. But instead, I did some dusting and light re-organizing. I also started a new project of restoring one of my mom's rooster knick knacks (it'll probably take a week or so to finish). Basically, I did something productive, and I contributed to someone else in some way. 

Recently, I also cleared out space in my room for a little yoga/meditation area. I don't have a yoga mat, so I just put an old blanket down on my floor. Yoga has helped my lower back pain, and it helps me sleep better at night. 

Good luck!"	tired_turnip_	reply	na	na	na	0.005251044407486916	weak	no	strong	na	dbtselfhelp
Beyond Opposite Action as the primary useful skill here (as other people mention), self-validation and self-soothing can be helpful first steps. Setting small goals can help—tell yourself that you only have to do something for five minutes (acting opposite all of the way!) and then you can get back into bed if you feel worse than you did beforehand. Reinforcement can be helpful to consider, too—how can you reward and be kind to yourself for getting out of bed etc.	tired_turnip_	reply	na	na	na	0.005251044407486916	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

This is something you might want to do ahead of when you're feeling like staying in bed all day, but I found cognitive rehearsal really helped me get out of bed this morning.

I think if like maybe your default mood is feeling sad or emptiness, raising your emotional baseline may look like feeling neutral or maybe even as far as optimistic or hopeful or grateful.

"BPD diagnosis here. Being alone is unbearable for me and can lead to many impulsive and self-harming behaviours. I want to improve this because my life is miserable and the least I can do is learn to deal with being alone so I can improve myself. 

Are there any dbt skills specific to coping with aloneness?"	gingfreecsisbad	post	10.459334208911931	female	White	0.008376475423574448	na	na	na	8	dbtselfhelp
"If something is intolerable, the first skill to use is distress tolerance. Wise mind ACCEPTS, IMPROVE, etc. etc. I personally play video games when I can't stand to be alone--they're immersive and I sort of lose track of time. 

But remember that distress tolerance only works in the short term--for a longer term solution, we need to turn to Emotion Regulation. 

The first step is identifying your emotions. What do you feel when you're alone? Are you scared? Ashamed? Sad? What are the thoughts in your head that cause the self harming behaviors? 

Identifying your emotions and thoughts then allow you to use check the facts, and after checking the facts, you can problem solve or use opposite action as needed."	gingfreecsisbad	reply	na	na	na	0.008376475423574448	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Allllllllll the distress tolerance skills. the ACCEPTS skill could be really helpful but make sure you personalise this for yourself. 

In terms of self harming with clients who I’m working with I recommend things like putting their knife in an ice cream tub filled with dater, and then putting it in the freezer. If your going to self harm then you’ll need to either break apart the tub and ice or wait. If you still want to harm yourself when you’ve finished then that’s your choice but what I often find is that wise mind just needs a bit of time usually to come out, and that’s where the extra hurdle comes in.

Same goes for other oils I’ve behaviours, if you can think of steps you can put in place to really delay them then that will help. 

A good chain analysis with a therapist can help you work out what things you might want to try differently in the future and learn from those times you’ve acted on impulse and then regretted it later."	gingfreecsisbad	reply	na	na	na	0.008376475423574448	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
This may sound basic or not super formal, but you could try changing your perspective of being alone. Example maybe when you are alone you can control your sensory environment, at least for a little bit. Maybe you can play music out loud or if maybe you are in a library you can wear earphones. Similar to video games, music *can* be a form of distraction, especially if it is something you are unfamiliar with. Another thing is when you are alone, *typically* you don’t have to immediately cater to anyone. Example, you don’t have to focus on maintaining a conversation, or even listening to someone, much less using your emotional labor to empathize with anyone. Also I think what the other person said about providing those barriers for yourself for the s3lf h@rm are really good.	gingfreecsisbad	reply	na	na	na	0.008376475423574448	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Thank you! I’ve noted those to do more research. 

One thing that helps me in distress is writing down my feelings in single words. That definitely helps bring me to reality a bit and fact-check the situation.

This is solid advice, thank you so much. I think forcing myself to listen to music is especially a good idea.. usually I refuse to intentionally distract myself because I become fixated on “distract yourself.

"Thank you for such a sweet comment! Honestly my DBT instincts mostly come from the unusually long program I was in (2 years of a complete DBT program), and the years I've been using it since. Time and practice are your best friends with therapy skills. 

Are you in a DBT program/DBT group? That will be the easiest way to learn this material. I personally prefer the group learning environment because it helps to see other people's thoughts and understanding of the concepts. 

The second best way is to have a DBT therapist who can explain the skills to you. I know that some people use apps/podcasts/etc, but honesty that's not really my vibe so unfortunately I can't offer any advice on that front--I think the sidebar has some resources if you're interested, though be warned that there are no studies proving efficacy when DBT skills are self-taught. My #1 advice to anyone getting into DBT is to find a group, preferably a competent one, but if you can only find a DBT therapist, that's the second best option. If you're lucky enough to have multiple options, I highly recommend interviewing your potential therapists/group leaders--there will be ones you click with, and I'm a strong believer that the click is important."	gingfreecsisbad	reply	na	na	na	0.008376475423574448	weak	strong	strong	na	dbtselfhelp
Yes another thing to keep in mind is if like you are really overwhelmed and you “force yourself” to listen to music despite being overwhelmed, that could be internalized ableism. I’m actually in an autistic burnout right now, so I can’t listen to music with people singing because it is overstimulating to me. But I can listen specifically this really low stimulating lullaby thing. It is Davy Jones music box from pirates of the Caribbean, and I think it was designed for people to listen to for sleep because it is 10 hours on YouTube. But yeah I wanted to mention that because I was concerned how you said you would force yourself to listen to music /infodump	gingfreecsisbad	reply	na	na	na	0.008376475423574448	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Wisemind helps me sometimes. I acknowledge that my emotional mind is getting all it's dopamine from The Person. And I do a bit of a thought exercise about what would rational mind do? And then I allow myself to try to meet in the middle somewhere. 
Example:
- Emotional mind: this person is life and I live for them. 
- Rational mind: You are a person in your own right and you're losing your identity (and your mind) trying to sacrifice yourself for them. You need to do something with your other friends, call your bestie, go on a run, do your chores, tidy up, get your shit together. 
- Wise mind: You're really into The Person, but you also need to try to be the best person you can be yourself too.

"I've had a lot of success working with Radical Acceptance - accepting my actions of obsessing over someone else was me trying to enact control over someone/a situation I had NO control over.  


Once I recognized I only control my own actions, I decided to get curious vs judgemental about WHY I was doing things that felt shitty (ie obsessing about my ex, stalking his socials, etc.)  Being curious vs blamey about my actions made choosing not to do those things easier. Less dopamine hits with each repitition until I decided these actions were not even a little helpful, only harmful and why would I do that to myself?   


I also heard repeatedly on therapy TikTok that obsessing over someone points to a lack or void in my own life. I'm using that obsession as a distraction from the lack in my own life. I'm working really hard on filling that void with things that fulfill me - perler bead art, listening to guided meditations on YT, writing (ie word vomiting) on a blog or legal pad, hanging my crafts on telephone poles, visiting the library, coloring books, googling random things to get smarter and more interesting, joining random discords (even tho I don't know how discord really works), creating burlesque, and repeatedly telling myself that doing ANYTHING AT ALL that puts my focus back on me is better than doing those things which only cement my obsession.   
   
there IS a thing called Relationship OCD - you may wanna google that and see how it resonates. Knowing why you're doing what youre doing can really help you come to terms with it.

"The main skill I use for obsessive thoughts is ""Turn the Mind"", that is, to consciously and mindfully change the subject of your thought to what you are engaged in, or to another thought or topic. Some notes on that one, from my experience:
- it's normal to kindly turn the mind back several times as you need
- this is like Radical Acceptance Light™ in that what you're doing is learning to accept the distressing thing without letting it derail your actions, or keep you from being effective with other skills
- I find turning the mind works best in tandem with another skill, even as broadly as Participate (I always call that ""Contribute"" accidentally because I tend to write cards etc to others, or volunteer, etc). Giving back to people often can help counteract the needs you feel you cannot fill without another person in your life

I have such a hard time understanding the concept of wise mind and how to use it? I understand that you can ask wise mind stuff and get an answer but like????? How????? How do you know it’s wise mind? How does it work? I have read so many descriptions and used worksheets but I just can’t understand this concept. Please help :(	Fragrant_Fisherman54	post	24.328592117703177	male	White	0.999504566192627	na	na	na	15	dbtselfhelp
"The way I understand it, wise mind is the “happy medium” between emotion mind and reasonable mind. So if you find yourself in emotion mind and prone to acting from those emotions, you can take a beat (maybe using another skill, like STOP or a mindfulness skill) and try to consider another, more logical perspective to counterbalance what you’re feeling/thinking.

For example, if someone declines an invitation to hang out on Thursday because they need to go get their nails done, my feelings might be hurt, and I might be tempted to manifest those feelings in action - maybe by telling my friend that’s not a good reason to decline plans, or by becoming distant and closed off to them. Instead, I can reflect on why it might be important to them to get their nails done on Thursday - maybe they have a special occasion, maybe they need some time to themselves, etc - and understand there may be other factors at play that don’t have to do with me…while at the same time recognizing that I really wanted to see them and feel disappointed. Trying to see things from another, more logical POV could prevent me from acting in a way that long term could sabotage the relationship.

This was a a truly random, long winded example but I hope it helped. Curious how others use this skill as well."	Fragrant_Fisherman54	reply	na	na	na	0.999504566192627	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"What helped me with a wise mind is to take a step back and understand the emotion of empathy. 

Because when you either get into a logical or emotional mind, you are judgemental of either the other person or yourself. For example, if you are making mistakes on a new task depending on who you are, you either will get sad, angry, emotional, or have intrusive thoughts that are beating yourself up. Having empathy for yourself allows you to use other skills like checking the facts, radical acceptance, opposite action that will pull you from either emotional or logical mind and into wise mind. 

&#x200B;

This holds true to when it involves someone else. As an example, if someone is late to pick you up you can either be emotional about it, having bad feelings towards the person or intrusive thoughts about the person. Having empathy for them also allows you to use skills and pull you into wise mind."	Fragrant_Fisherman54	reply	na	na	na	0.999504566192627	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"I'll give you an analogy: 

You're buying a car and really like the idea of a fancy sports car because it looks cool and can drive fast. You know you should buy a Prius because it's energy efficient and much cheaper, but very ugly in your opinion. In this case, the sports car represents the emotional mind, based on what you feel is cool. The prius is based on the logical mind because it will save you money, but it doesn't satisfy your feelings.

"Hi, everyone. I live with my mom and step dad (I'm a 27 year old female), and I decided to clean my room some to make room to start doing yoga. While I was cleaning, I found all sorts of goodies I had either forgotten about or thought I had lost forever. One of the things I found was a brand new backpack/purse I had never used. I decided to designate it as my new purse. Only with this purse, I wanted to incorporate coping skills to keep my hands busy, as I am currently trying to quit vaping (I vape mostly just to have something to do with my hands). So, I filled my little purse with a small notebook (to keep track of appointments, jot down ideas, and so on), a squishy ball that I adore playing with, a bear-shaped squishy toy, a hair tie, a pop-it bracelet, and some firm putty. I'm hoping to add more things as I aquire them, as there's a little more room left in my purse! I've gotta put my wallet in there, and my earbuds are in the front compartment. 

Anyway, I just thought this would be a fun idea for anyone here who carries a purse. Non-purse carrying people can probably do a coping skills tote or something.

"I have the best recommendation as I just got out of a 5 week, 8hr per day, intense therapy that involved heavy DBT Skills. I now attend weekly DBT groups in person, but in between, I immerse myself into this pod cast: please look up this app for the best DBT resource, DBT and Me. These two therapists are DBT Trained and based out of Seattle, WA. There are plenty of episodes to choose from. They have Q&A's and then also episodes completely dedicated to certain skills, such as mindfulness, etc. This app is free, and in my opinion, the best resource for Gold Standard DBT Skills. 
YouTube is also a great resource. Look up Marsha Linehan. She is the one behind DBT and she is fascinating. You may want to look into purchasing the Marsha Linehan DBT workbook, and perhaps the training manual that is associated with it.

"&#x200B;

In case anybody is interested in reading an example of how I used the DEARMAN tool today, and how I feel about it. Hopefully it might help someone else as well. 

Background: I've been seeing somebody on and off for a while \], and it's messing with my head for reasons that aren't important here. I decided I needed to place some firm boundaries in place. There's nothing new there, I do this on a regular basis, but in a way that is ineffective. I usually ramble over several paragraphs, throw in some mind-reading and fortune-telling cognitive distortions, and a heavy sprinkle of totally lost identity (I'll be whatever you want me to be, blah blah blah). 

This morning, I used \[thisvideo\]\[[https://youtu.be/EC-M59r-0jg](https://youtu.be/EC-M59r-0jg)\]  to guide me through the process and remind me of the steps to follow. 

Describe: 'You cancelled again, I was due to see you this morning'.

Express: I feel like I'm very low on your priority list right now and it hurts. 

Ask: 'If you want to see me again in the future, I'm happy to do that if you are keen and we can make firm plans'.

Reinforce: That's kinda covered above, if he wants it, he can have it, as long as he's enthusiastic and clear about that. 

Mindful: This is where I'm actually really proud of how concise my message is. Just a three short sentences, not a waffling emotional train-of-thought. 

Appear confident: on message, not in person, so keeping it short and to the point. 

Negotiate: Not really relevant here. He just replied with 'okay'. 

&#x200B;

I feel pretty rough about it. But I also feel hope, which is something I haven't felt for a while. I'm actually really proud of myself and how I handled this, instead of losing my self control. I feel pretty gutted that this is probably going to be the end of this thing that we had, but I can also be relieved that I can start to move on.

"I am going to be graduating from my group DBT program after a year, and I'm really, really nervous. I'm worried about backsliding when I lose that component of my support system. It has been so helpful learning from other people who have the same struggles as me. I feel so seen and understood. Without that in my life, I'm so worried about being able to remain skillful without feeling understood. 

My DBT therapist recommended that I make a cope ahead plan for after graduation. I really like that idea, but I don't all know what to include in my cope ahead plan for something as big and nebulous as this. I have made a cope ahead plan before for very specific crises (like if I'm canceled on), but not something like ending therapy with unknown outcomes.

"When I was coming up to the end of my DBT programme I had very similar worries to you. I think it’s reasonable to have concerns about the level of support you’re used to being reduced and feeling daunted by the big wide world after therapy. Please remember there’s so many of us who are still out here, doing ok and making life worth living independently :) 

One thing I did that made me feel more confident in my skills use was to create a ‘cheat sheet’. This was a document with all negative emotions listed, what they felt like/how to recognise them, what could prompt them, and the skills I’d use to deal with them, as well as the page numbers for relevant handouts/worksheets from my DBT manual. It’s a Google Doc so I can always access it quickly on my laptop or phone. It has come in handy so SO many times, especially when I feel overwhelmed with emotion and don’t know what skill to use. It’s like a fast-track plan of the things that I know work for me. This, in a way, is a cope ahead plan for any negative emotions I may feel, regardless of the causes.

Personally, it helps to have an accountability buddy, which is a strategy I picked up from ADHD treatment. Do you have anyone in your life who knows DBT or would be interested in learning? For a while I was teaching DBT skills to all my friends, haha. A lot of them got convinced to take DBT themselves and now I have a group of people who all know DBT lingo and we can help each other out. Honestly, when I'm particularly struggling, I post on here a lot--often not even to ask for help; sometimes on an automod post with a little note about what I've been up to DBT-wise.

I forgot to mention - I do also fill in a diary card every evening and once a week I’ll sit down to do something DBT-related: reading a chapter from the workbook, listening to a podcast, watching a YouTube video etc. I just found it helpful to keep refreshed with skills. 

I have been out of DBT since April 2022, so nearly a year now. I have had times where I’ve wished I still had a therapist and group to ask questions or gain advice, but part of the process is also learning you can do ok on your own.

"Hi everyone,

This may be a little unusual, but I have a particular dissociative disorder that affects something called absorption. The disorder itself stems from PTSD. Basically, it's the feeling of being absorbed in your thoughts--like that moment when you're off in your own thoughts a little too hard and you don't notice someone calling your name? Except I get that involuntary ""off in my own thoughts"" moment all the time, where a thought--whether it's a traumatic memory or a daydream--will ""take over"" my brain. I often walk on autopilot and ""wake up"" at a location with barely any memory of how I got there because I was so absorbed in my thoughts. It's also embarrassing because I often accidentally act out or say parts of my thoughts. For example, if I'm defending myself in my memory, I often find myself flinching when I accidentally walk into a tree branch (again, because I'm so absorbed in my thoughts I literally don't ""see"" that I'm walking into a tree until I'm dealing with branches in my face) and raising my hands to my face. I think saying the exact phrases will get my post removed, but my high absorption also causes me to say hateful, awful things to myself because I just say them on autopilot as I deal with intense feelings of shame, fear, or anger, or I'll be yelling at myself because I'm intensely remembering someone yelling at me and I'm ""saying their lines,"" so to speak.

Although I had never heard of dissociative disorder until my diagnosis, I was wondering if anyone has dealt with this as well, and what skills/exercises you use. I'd appreciate specific mindfulness exercise suggestions, as well as any other skill to combat this.

With mindfulness, it will be easier to do in moments of dissociation/distress if you’ve been practising when you’re feeling calm and level headed. So start being mindful as often as you can, brushing your teeth, cooking, having a shower. Even if you can only manage it for 30 seconds. It’s like working a muscle.

"For starters, this is not unusual in PTSD. Some people literally take their car and ""wake up"" hundreds of miles away.
In the coming weeks I'd suggest trying to note the signs you're going into a dissociative state, and identifying the triggers. Then, when you see the early signs or you've experienced a trigger, do something that grounds you in the present. It can be holding an ice cube in your fist or naming the objects that surround you, or both. If you have anything that you feel grounds you, a particular smell, the pressure around you when you take a bath etc, use it to your advantage"	localmuffinwhore	reply	na	na	na	0.00443642633035779	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Certain mindfulness exercises have definitely been the most helpful thing I've found so far. I agree with you that I should try to stop it from snowballing--thanks for the suggestion. It's definitely an escape/coping mechanism (as dissociation tends to be, from my understanding) so sometimes I don't want it to stop, even when I know it's bad, so this is a good reminder to keep trying to nip this in the bud, or at least try to be more mindful while it happens, haha.

I do have a therapist--talking to her is a good idea. She's technically DBT trained but we've been doing more positive psych and psychodynamic therapy recently. I selfishly miss DBT groups after finishing my 2 year program a few years back, so I like to come here and ask some internet strangers for some fresh ideas, haha. But honestly, finding information on absorption has been way harder than other run-of-the-mill PTSD problems so tapping my therapist for help is probably the smartest choice.

"I feel that I know the cause pretty well, though if a decade of therapy has taught me nothing else, it's that I never know myself 100%, haha. From what I can tell, I think my trauma has made it so that I fundamentally feel scared and ashamed all the time. Absorption provides a release from that, either by making me super absorbed in my daydreams (which are positive, but still makes me look like a crazy person in the street--I'm often gesticulating or talking to myself at completely normal volume and people have told me I get a ""far away"" look in my eyes) or by doubling down on the traumatic memories (this often only happens when I'm stressed). Basically, I think absorption is a coping mechanism to deal with the intense self-loathing I feel 100% of the time.

I'm not sure if distress tolerance skill is exactly the right skill because I'm not really in distress--my absorption has a good chance of being positive, which makes me believe that high absorption *is* the distress tolerance skill my brain has developed, and it uses it even when it's not necessary. I hope that makes sense. I know that this problem is super weird; thanks for trying to help me out.

Sorry that this wasn't clear--I actually practice mindfulness pretty regularly (2x a day for 5 ish min), but I'm admittedly shit at being alone with my thoughts so I pair it with something else (mindfulness of emotion as I write out my gratitude log in the morning; mindfulness of my body/thoughts while I do PMR at night). That's why I asked for specific exercises--I was wondering if anyone else had found some particular mindfulness exercise helpful for dissociation specifically. I totally agree that mindfulness in general is the most effective remedy against dissociation, though--it's just frustrating because dissociation feels like this pit I'll never climb out of...thanks for the suggestion though!

The grounding techniques you've mentioned have been suggested to me before, but unfortunately they don't work on me--I'm not sure why :( My theory is that my absorption is maybe too high, whereas my depersonalization scores (which I understand people typically score high on in a dissociation disorder) are relatively low.

"That makes total sense! You’ve created a place (albeit through dissociation) that feels safer and “better” than your current reality.
I was leaning towards distress tolerance skills only as a means to create more of an ability to sit with what you describe as l scared and ashamed.  Ideally, once you’re better able to sit with these emotions, you could begin practicing and using emotion regulation skills.

Another thought (and something to Google) could be increasing your “window of tolerance”. Like another commenter mentioned, mindfulness skills can help increase this. 

Regardless, below are some websites I found on dissociation and the use of DBT that seem more user friendly. I know for me - academic journals are very rarely helpful for day to day support!

"My best friend (F26) and I (F24) have had a really difficult week. We got into an argument last Friday and things were quite awkward until this past Thursday. She assured me that I hadn’t done nothing wrong, we were just being stubborn, and that it’s okay. But I am struggling heavily with guilt. We started having issues because we recently joined a new friend group that has just brought a lot of drama. And while I’m not directly involved, I sort of involved myself on a topic that we didn’t agree on and that caused the fight. I have been heartbroken because my friend means so much to me and she keeps saying it’s okay, but I don’t think she realizes how the guilt is killing me and how I feel the friend group drama is kind of amplifying my fear of abandonment with her. I feel since the fight I have been extra anxious and emotional, which I’m afraid might be heavy on her. When I saw her in person for the first time since the fight yesterday, we hugged and things seemed better. Drama from the friend group today seems to have made things slightly awkward again between me being anxious (but not involved in the drama directly) and her being upset about the drama

I really want the two of us to get together in person, and not necessarily talk about it because she doesn’t really want to, but just to relieve some of the stress and tension now that things are a little cooled down. I want her to know her friendship means so much to me and that this is just a small bump in the road and I want to be a better friend. And I’m hoping something fun with the two of us might help.

"10 Steps for Practicing Radical Acceptance 

1. Observe that you are fighting against reality. (Ex: “It shouldn’t be like this.”)

2. Remind yourself that the unpleasant reality cannot be changed. (Ex: “It happened.”)

3. Acknowledge that something led to this moment. (Ex: “This is how it happened.”)

4. Practice acceptance with not only your mind, but your body and spirit. Be mindful of your breath, posture.

5. List what your behavior would look like if you did accept the facts then act accordingly.

6. Plan ahead with events that seem unacceptable and think about how you should appropriately cope.

7. Remain mindful of physical sensations throughout your body such as tension or stress.

8. Embrace feelings such as disappointment, sadness, or grief.

9. Acknowledge that life is worth living even when there might be temporary pain.

"Its *so* hard, but it’s the skill I’ve found most useful. 

I’d say start small. And be really specific. What’s the one thing at the top of your list that’s bothering you most right now? 

Say for example you hate your apartment.  But you can’t move until you get a new job. So you feel stuck and every day it’s getting you down and fighting with the situation is draining your energy. 

You can think; ‘I hate this apartment. I want to change it. I don’t want to live here. AND. This is where I live. Realistically I can’t move for now’. 

It’s like, two things can be true at once. 

Accepting your situation or something that happened in the past doesn’t mean you *like* or *approve* of it, or that you don’t *still want to change it*.

It’s just letting go of the emotional charge of the *facts* of the situation, which are unchangeable, if you get me. 

It’s not asking you to change your thinking entirely, it’s just asking for a little nuance. It’s there to add another perspective to your thinking, i.e. that despite how you feel about it, the facts of the situation remain the same. 

And that sounds like giving up power, but that surrender and acceptance actually leaves you feeling more powerful, with more options, not fewer. 

Once you accept something, I’ve found that it makes it possible to move on or move forward. While you’re still struggling to accept what is or what was, you can’t."	Amor_Fati_Junkie	reply	na	na	na	0.010014989413321018	no	no	strong	na	dbtselfhelp
"Radical Acceptance is one of the cores of DBT, and while it is one of the simplest things on the surface, as you've experienced it can be pretty painful.

The best thing to do is to practice, though I will add this; the group I've participated in has placed heavy emphasis on praticing as much of DBT, Stress Tolerance, and Distraction Techniques while in a settled state of mind as possible. That way, you build a physiological connection to the feeling of being physical calm while practicing what you have learned.

It has been suggested to try starting simple, and I would agree. This is not foolproof, but what I did was start by ""priming the pump"" with easy to accept things.

The sky *is* blue.

The grass near my house *is* tan and brown.

I *am* sitting in my living room.

Atune yourself to that feeling, of looking at something and calling it what it is without judgement.

It *is* Winter right now. I do not like the cold, but it *is* winter right now. The state in which things exist at this moment is independant of how we as people feel about said existence, and it is through knowing the way that things are right now, that we can address how we want things to be in the future without living in the future and not acknowledging the present."

The idea is by teaching the parents DBT as well, you're teaching them to help their BPD kid with skills and giving the family interpersonal tools to fix family dynamics. So DBT definitely *has* been used on people with no diagnosable mental illness. 

I personally think everyone should do DBT if they can afford to, because I find it such a helpful program on how to understand your emotions. Most people are not as emotionally healthy as they think they are. That being said, if you're not diagnosed with anything, I'm doubtful your insurance will cover DBT, as least for the ~4-12 months that a typical program lasts."

I'm willing to bet most parents of people with BPD have mental illnesses. Maybe not the types who would actually do DBT themselves to help though. My parents definitely would never do anything like that. Sorry, I just found it funny trying to imagine the typical parents of people who end up with BPD being mentally healthy individuals.

"Yeah, that's why I said ""sometimes not mentally ill,"" lol. I do find that usually, at least one of the parents of a BPD child will have BPD or sometimes bipolar, which aligns with the theory that part of BPD is genetic. I have met some exceptional cases where neither parent had BPD, but there was family history of it elsewhere (grandparent, aunt, etc). I find it unfortunate that most parents who sign up for essentially DBT parenting classes are the ones who are least likely to be mentally ill--as you said, the ones who need help the most are usually busy blaming their child (in my personal experience)."

"Hello friends. 
Note before we start I have complex ptsd and not BPD but I am 3/4 of the way through trauma informed DBT and am waiting to talk to my individual psych on Wednesday
I’m in relationship crisis at the moment and while it is searingly painful I do also know the opposite action self care things that I need to do to maintain (most importantly eating, showering, brushing teeth and working) 
But I find myself really struggling to do these with the thoughts partially it feeling too hard and it’s too painful but also if I don’t act as devastated as possible I won’t be noticed/taken seriously/ no one will care or look after me. 
This was a feature of my childhood abuse/neglect and I would always be soothed if I had a hysterical meltdown but a lot of the rest of the time I felt alone ignored neglected etc. Day to day I also struggle with self care (not eating or working though, mainly hygiene stuff). 

I am wondering if anyone has words of wisdom to help me past what seems to be wilfulness and into willingness to look after myself? 

Thankyou."	neko_loliighoul	post	12.99419789848465	male	White	0.7255235910415649	na	na	na	9	dbtselfhelp
"That's really hard, I'm so sorry.

You're definitely thinking in the right direction! When I get willful, I turn back to radical acceptance. For me, willfulness is deeply tied to wanting to reject reality. I have to come back to radical acceptance and find that acceptance at a deep level before I can unlock willingness. I do that by grounding, doing a meditation, journaling, or even taking a moment to say out loud ""I'm going to complain"" and then complain as much as I want about everything I wish was different.

I'd also think about doing some guided loving kindness meditations, too. When I get in a loop of acting out to get attention, I resolve it by choosing to love myself first. Then I'm not as desperate for others' approval or love. I like loving kindness meditations because they do the thinking for me and I just have to be in the moment and follow along.

The last one is distress tolerance. I always go on a SUDs (subjective units of distress) basis. If you're not familiar with SUDs, it's basically ranking your current distress from 1, totally zen, to 10, the most upset you've ever been in your life. The hardest part is figuring out what each number correlates to for you; for example, if I'm actively having a panic attack, I'm at least a 9, but an anxiety attack is more like a 5-7. Once you know what each number is, check in regularly with yourself where you're at. If you're at a 7 or above, you need distress tolerance skills. I always go to TIPs, so I can't remember the others. But some distress tolerance to bring my distress down is key. My program talked about how when you're in distress, you *cannot* be effective with any skills other than distress tolerance. So if you're finding yourself high on the distress scale, I'd go for those skills until you come down a bit and then look into emotion regulation and radical acceptance.

That's a bit scattershot on ideas, but I hope at least one helps."	neko_loliighoul	reply	na	na	na	0.7255235910415649	strong	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Hey friend, I'm sorry you're going through such a hard time. Relationship problems are always tough. 

First of all, I totally understand the impulse to melt down every time you're in need of care, especially care from a partner--I used to do the same thing. For me, the key was to learn that others will care for me and understand even when I don't fall apart (and possibly even more when I'm not screaming hysterically at them, which was common for me lol). 

Personally, it sounds like your need of care is justified, so I'd try to problem solve instead of use opposite action (just on the care aspect, perhaps not on other aspects of the relationship issue). Maybe you can reach out to a friend and ask them to do something wholesome together? For me, that includes: hiking, going to a favorite restaurant, and movie night at home with homemade popcorn, lots of blankets, and my pets snuggled around me. And maybe some venting/crying to the friend as needed. 

Self care is great, and I encourage it, but I find that sometimes, we just need a friend by our side. Humans are social animals and I think it's important to get validation and empathy from lots of people. I think this will also help your brain recognize that 1) other people that are not your partner can take care of you too and 2) if you reach out and admit you're vulnerable instead of demonstrating how much of a mess you are, people will still come and help out. 

Anyway, apologies if I'm off the mark--if you feel strongly you want to strengthen your self care skills, I think that's admirable. I just think that people sometimes think, ""self care or partner"" and I do think there are other options."	neko_loliighoul	reply	na	na	na	0.7255235910415649	strong	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
I am a beginner with DBT not an expert at all, however I would recommend simply being patient with yourself. And technically showering is not something that you *must* do every day, especially if you don’t plan on seeing any humans that day🤷🏽. Another thing that may help is directly telling people, (like friends or your support system) hey, I’m having a hard time right now. Could you check in with me more frequently? But yeah it always sucks to have an unreliable support system. Try to be patient with yourself and keep a glass or water bottle near you to stay hydrated, and know that it’s ok if the best you can do right now is easy meals like Mac and cheese or heating up frozen food instuff—someone in an autistic burnout	neko_loliighoul	reply	na	na	na	0.7255235910415649	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Cope ahead would be a great skill here! 

Also, can you break it down into smaller steps? For example: Maybe sleep in your room but not in your bed, in a different spot in your room, or move your bed within your room. Then sleep somewhere different in your house. Then try camping outside your house in a tent. Then try staying the night at a hotel or a friend’s house that is closer to you. Could you also try staying part of the night first before trying to stay the whole night?

Opposite action could also be helpful, as well as radically accepting your anxiety and checking the facts about worst case scenario and how you would and could handle it.

Could you keep your nightly routine roughly the same when you stay the night and/or bring some objects or nightly routine elements from home to keep some familiarity?

I agree with above, cope ahead sounds like a good skill for this! I like to sit down somewhere quiet and close my eyes and talk out loud how I’m going to cope. And I always exaggerate a little bit - e.g. “I will be lying in bed at my friends house and I will feel safe and I will feel good that I decided to come here”.

"Just wondering if this is something you would use often? How does it work with your therapist? Do you always get a response?

The reason I'm asking is because it's something my therapist has been telling me I should be using. I had a hard time in the past, building up the courage to text her for a call because I struggle with feeling like I'm burdening her. 

But in the weeks running up to Christmas and ever since I've been really struggling. I text her twice for a call before Christmas and she only responded to 1. 

Since Christmas I was meant to have 2 one to one sessions but both have been cancelled. My psychiatrist appt was cancelled also. I have a lot going on right now and I am not coping well. I've text her twice looking for a call in the last week and nothing....  I would understand completely if she was off sick or something but I know for a fact she has been in the service working. 

This has really disappointed me. My confidence in myself and her is shot. I feel like I'm just an inconvenience to her and it's horrible. I have so much going on right now that I can't handle and I'm really struggling to use the skills effectively.

"Ohh that’s not good at all. I think it works differently in each place, but both the places I’ve done it have called me back within half an hour. At one place (a PHP program) you could call 24/7 and be connected with whichever therapist was on call that day. Then when I switched to an outpatient DBT practice, it was just with my therapist. She said she wasn’t available for coaching after 10 pm and before 7 am or something like that. But outside of that, I just text her and she’ll message me back or call me back in half an hour to an hour. 

To answer your question about how often I used it: When I was having a really really rough time, I used it every day (that was like a week). When I was having a normal rough time, maybe once a week. Nowadays I don’t use it at all as I’m doing better (yay :) ). 

I think it’s irresponsible of your therapist to a) not respond at all to one of your requests. The appropriate response would have been something like “whoops sorry just saw this, how are you now? Want me to call?” And b) cancel without giving you an option to reschedule or giving you an option to have a session with someone else in the meantime.

What  I'm so upset about is that she is constantly telling me to use the phone coaching. But now when I really need it she's not there. I haven't seen her in a month and I'm not coping well. 

I'm really apprehensive about making a complaint or saying something to her because (1) I hate confrontation 🙈 and (2) the programme I'm using is a community funded programme that I don't pay for and it's really hard to get into it. What if I made a complaint and I'm removed from the service?

I have to respect the times when is not available because she is in a session with another client or she is asleep or she's minding her daughter.

"This does resonate with me, as I've struggled with this when I was in my 1st year of DBT. 

It took over the year to get used to using the skill, but I think before I could really self - validate I needed to use a lot of Radical Acceptance of my life and situation and Turning the Mind to acceptance of the things I can control and can't. Acceptance of your self and validating yourself takes so much work, I was in a place of so much self-hate before that it was a constant fight with that skill til I got used to using distress tolerance of radical acceptance before I could go back to that skill. 

I think the multiple distress tolerance skills with be your friend till you ween your way into using the emotion reg skill of self validation and I would instead focus more on other mindfulness techniques and definitely checking the facts when you can, of yourself and any of the situation your in. It's hard not to be frustrated with yourself when things don't work right away, but that's probably why radical acceptance is a distress tolerance skill because it leans into the idea that when we accept we can slowly progress into that mindset of calming down and then work the way into the chance modules of emotional regulation with change. 

Hopefully that makes some sense. Reminder, it took me 2 years to get this nailed and I still have my struggles as it's a daily thing to keep doing with practicing skills, but in the end it's worth it.

I like to think of it like this: emotions are there to fuel you.  Anger is a good motivator in some situations and in others you have to keep it in.  In those situations where you can’t act on your anger, that’s where not only validation comes in, but also reflection.  I never really felt heard growing up, so I had to train myself to sort of be my own parent as an adult.  Often reflecting or paraphrasing to myself the issue and then validating the stress helps.  “So you’re pissed off because that person cut you off without a blinker and didn’t even acknowledge their insult to you” (reflection), followed by “yeah, that totally sucks anyone would be angry about that” (validation).

"on the surface, it does. but when i looked more into it, radical acceptance is less a ""get over it"" concept and more of a non-judgmental way to look at the facts of the situation. in the DBT workbook, it's described as allowing yourself to see yourself and the situation as it really is, and not the way we normally would when we focus on our intense emotions and blaming whatever or whomever for said situation, whether that's yourself, someone else, or whatever had happened leading to that point.

a direct quote from the workbook, p. 51: ""You need to change the behaviors in your life that are creating more suffering for yourself and others while simultaneously also accepting yourself the way you are.""

and earlier in the book, p. 11: ""Keep in mind that radical acceptance does not mean that you condone or agree with bad behavior in others...For example, if you’re in an abusive relationship and you need to get out, then get out.""

radically accepting something is a choice to make, and may need to be made more than once for any given situation. turning the mind is noticing that you've strayed from that choice, and while being non-judgmental of having strayed, turning yourself back to that choice of radical acceptance.

"No, because ""what am I gonna do about it"" allows answers to be vast and wide, and the whole intention behind that is there are certain answers to that question that are wrong.

But if I feel my feelings too much, people can sense it, even if I say nothing, which makes them feel bad, stressed, etc, and overall one the things I shouldn't do. No answer is correct. I just have to ""get over"" whatever the issue is."	No_Refrigerator_5804	reply	na	na	na	0.9994309544563293	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
I watched a YouTube talk with Blaise Aguirre recently and he said something that I hadn't really realized before--the skills are meant to help US, not other people, but to make US feel better or be better able to tolerate our feelings. I had been trying all these DBT skills largely in an effort to make things easier for my boyfriend, but once I heard him say that it honestly made me want to do the skills more because I was doing them mostly for me. I hear what you're saying though and have some similar frustrations.	No_Refrigerator_5804	reply	na	na	na	0.9994309544563293	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"i think these are valid concerns tbh! a lot of DBT skills are meant to be used together. these skills are from the ""distress tolerance"" section of the book, so i guess the best way i can explain it is that these two, along with the others in this chapter, are meant to reduce emotional intensity. not to the extent of dissociation, and definitely not to disconnect from emotions, which i can understand how those skills might seem like that's what they are. it's more like how when you'd have those incredibly intense emotions, it's really hard to see things clearly. kind of like how the book describes it, it says it's like wearing sunglasses indoors. idk if i'm explaining this in a way that would be easier to understand? but essentially, when i'm using the distress tolerance skills, i don't disconnect completely from my emotions. i still feel them - but in a way that more appropriately fits the situation. as someone with BPD, it's really hard to not feel such overwhelming amounts of emotions when i'm in distress. when i feel those intense emotions, i'm more likely to act impulsively in a way that could be harmful for myself, the other people involved, or all of us involved. so i would use these skills to reduce the intense emotions from such a high level. ig on a scale of 0-100, 100 being the highest extreme of emotions, depending on the situation, after using those skills it would bring that 100 down to 60, 50, 40, etc. so that i would still be able to feel what i need to feel, but not react at a level that's more than what is necessary.

is this more helpful? idk, i'm having a hard time explaining it correctly without sounding ""robotic"" :')

edit: i'd also like to say that these aren't meant to protect others from your emotions, more so your reactions to those emotions which might not be healthy depending on what those reactions are! the distress tolerance skills aren't to say that the emotions are wrong, and how other people react to our emotions isn't our responsibility. what and how we say and do things could be unhealthy, but ultimately, the other person is responsible for their emotions, not you. does this make sense?

edit #2: ALSO also, you're right when you say ""i can't just do what i want and feel what i feel"" bc that's exactly on point. i think there might be a misunderstanding here? bc radical acceptance and turning the mind address that concern, without dismissing your own emotions and while also not acting on those emotions in a destructive manner :)"	No_Refrigerator_5804	reply	na	na	na	0.9994309544563293	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Hello All!

I have been working on DBT skills and talk-/group-therapy solutions to help inform myself and learn about DBT skills.

I think things are going well, but there is a constant problem: I can't seem to want to meet people in person.

This has been an issue for much of my life, and it does not seem directly connected to medically treated anxiety - I have been on several medications including a large dose of Klonopin to try and quell anxious thoughts, and the best thing that happens is not feeling -so- bad about it, but still experiening an inability to follow through with social plans, or sometimes to even see the point of being social (if I start being social, then I have to maintain relationships, and I have to know about people and work at remembering them and keeping data straight and...). I am also currently being medicated for depression and mood swings.

I feel like there might be something DBT related that could help me, but the only thing coming to mind is Opposite Action, and it doesn't seem to be enough; even if I go through with meeting people anyways, I am awkward, quiet, and still don't want to be there until I leave. That happens with everyone, basically.

Anything y'all might suggest would be greatly appreciated."	portobox1	post	23.74362064209734	female	White	0.9966416358947754	na	na	na	5	dbtselfhelp
Distress tolerance is a good one- learning to be comfortable with being uncomfortable, something WAY easier said then done. With anything anxiety related, exposure therapy is a great tool. Slowly working your way up to the goal. step 1 could be thinking about meeting with someone in person and letting the negative emotions come and go while practicing your coping/relaxation strategies. once you feel comfortable in that discomfort and confident with your skills you can step it up a notch :)	portobox1	reply	na	na	na	0.9966416358947754	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"So it seems to me there are myriad issues here: the first is your social anxiety, which you've rightly identified opposite action as the standard skill to combat it with. But I think there's a second issue when you say: ""even if I through with meeting people, I am awkward, quiet [etc]"". 

The second seems to be an issue of interpersonal effectiveness. In the interpersonal effectiveness section, there are handouts and worksheets about how to get others to like you, and generally how to make friends more effectively. 

The third issue I find is your comment that you ""sometimes don't even see the point of being social."" I think that this is a moment for you to use your wise mind and figure out the pros and cons of being social/not being social. It may be that you're perfectly happy to keep a small circle of very good friends rather than a sprawling network of somewhat or pretty good friends. That's perfectly legitimate, in which case maybe you don't want to attend certain types of events. For example, I decided a long time ago I hate clubbing and large parties. So now, I still to dinner party type events where I may meet 2-5 new people, but I can have one on one/fairly deep conversations with them instead of meeting 25 different new people at a gala or a company wide party. So I think part of it is to figure out what works for you using wise mind, and honing on those skills rather than forsaking a social life altogether."	portobox1	reply	na	na	na	0.9966416358947754	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Do you actually want to meet up with people in person? If so, is there a value you have (maybe connection, feeling supported and/or supporting others, giving back to the community, etc.) that you could think of and try to keep in mind to possibly help you focus on why you actually want to follow through or why it would be fit with your long-term goals and values? This could help you to follow through if the issue is you really do want to go to align with your values but because of your anxiety, you want to cancel/avoid.

Other ideas include the Cope Ahead skill (part of ABC PLEASE), practicing mindfulness of current thoughts while with people and/or before, and really practicing Opposite Action ""all the way,"" as Marsha Linehan says it should be practiced. This would not just showing up, but trying your best to show up and really throw yourself into the meet-up--talking to people (or listening mostly and talking some), having a confident and ""willing"" body posture--maybe practice half-smile while there. You could also try doing a DBT pros/cons for going versus not going to meet up with people and refer back to it if you make plans and then feel the urge to cancel on someone. Lastly, you could practice Mindfulness of Others (in the interpersonal effectiveness module) while out. This could help take some of the focus off of your anxiety while also helping to effectively build relationships/friendships.

Not a DBT skill, but you could also try other types of social activities (maybe meeting one-on-one is more your style if you've been trying to meet up for group activities or vice versa). I recently started volunteering at our humane society, and it only requires me to have pretty minimal human interaction (mostly interacting with the cats, which I love), but it still helps me get out of the house and get some interaction (I work from home) while also accumulating positives (cats!), and to act in accordance with my value of helping others/animals and giving back to the community. Maybe there are some volunteer opportunities you could try out if that's of interest at all. 

I personally can relate to a lot of what you said and at this point, the only person I really feel like hanging out with is my boyfriend. I used to do all kinds of Meetup groups (mostly hiking groups), and I sometimes enjoyed it, but most of the time I would wind up just wishing I was hiking alone.

When I get distracted by something I’m no longer mindful of the time and have a resistance to getting back to the task at hand. I’m thinking that general mindfulness practice might help, but are there any skills I can use in the moment to snap out of being distracted? If not, I’d love to hear more about how to practice mindfulness tailored towards this kind of situation.	swtmoonlight	post	30.343570881717355	female	White	0.9967302083969116	na	na	na	18	dbtselfhelp

When distracted I usually use mindfulness and pausing for the moment to breath, stop, reevaluate my task at hand, continue. I like square breathing and counting as it allows my brain to focus on that and then I can ground myself back to the present moment. If distractions lead to distress which has happened before, I use the STOP skills, Stop, Take a Pause, Observe, Proceed mindfully, and continue what I'm doing.	swtmoonlight	reply	na	na	na	0.9967302083969116	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Mindfulness will help in general with being able to stay in the present moment and not get trapped in ones own mind.

I've found for myself that an extension of STOP is helpful - I step away from whatever has distracted me and allow my mind to clear while I wait for my pulse to settle, then I reassess what I was doing, what needs doing, and take a moment to consider the time cost of both options.

I phrase it that way because there are times when my mind goes birdwalking, but there was a purpose to it at the start, that likely took less time to execute than endless distraction. So I see if I can regain my bearings for what that immediate side task was, and if it won't take much time I'll do it - otherwise, or if it's not evidentiarily more important than my original task at hand, I will just leave it for later and go back to my original project with a clearer head and calmer body.

The other reason I suggest stop is, for myself, if I am getting distracted then I am no longer operating in Wise Mind; my emotions and subconscious body rhythms have taken the reins from my conscious mind and are now driving. Whatever I try and do in that state will be either a distraction, an agitation, or likely both. It's only when I've allowed my body to relax that I can step back into Wise Mind.

Forgive me if my advice is not the most well informed; I am still in the process of learning DBT skills myself, as well."	swtmoonlight	reply	na	na	na	0.9967302083969116	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

Is it like losing hours in video games or tv? If that’s the case, being more intentional with your time and set a timer before you start the task. Allow yourself only that allotted time and if you’re going to do that (mindless) task, then allow yourself to be completely engaged in that task. When the timer goes off, take a few breaths and move on to your next task. Alarms are great ways to break from distraction.	swtmoonlight	reply	na	na	na	0.9967302083969116	no	no	strong	na	dbtselfhelp
For me personally I set an alarm or timer. I get distracted frequently, probably related to some mental health stuff. I often set two alarms or timers as a back up plan. In case I turn the first alarm or timer off. Placing your phone, or whatever you are using as an alarm/timer far enough away that you can't access it easily is important, at least in my issues with distraction. That way you have to literally get up and out of your comfort zone.

I don't set alarms/timers usually. Because of the Willfulness factor. I am more Willingly, if still reluctant, to set alarms or timers for things like doctor appointments, or scheduled appointments in general. I use a stopwatch daily with a digital watch. The actual time is not set correctly on the digital watch. I only use the stopwatch feature on the digital watch, though I would set the time based on the principle of having a watch to tell time. Lol, I can't figure out how to set the time. So, the stopwatch is nice because I can easily and almost immediately start or stop it. The stopwatch I use to help with behavior modification strategies I am trying on myself. I do this type of strategy almost every day. I lately do strategies heavily using the stop watch feature of the watch for exercise and chores. Both help me to be less sedentary, the chores is for a better living environment for my mental health. I could go on and on. If you have any questions feel free to ask!	swtmoonlight	reply	na	na	na	0.9967302083969116	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
Also, with how I use the alarms/timers/stopwatch I have not gotten used to them in a way that makes them ineffective. The stopwatch does require some amount of Mindfulness because only you can start or stop it when using the stopwatch feature to check the quantity of time accurately by whatever you happen to be tracking. Like if my goal was to do five minutes of washing dirty dishes or whatever type of chores, I would need to stop the stopwatch after I'm done doing the dishes. If it only took three minutes, I would find another chore/s to do, and so on, while referencing/starting or stopping, the stopwatch. Till I ment or exceeded the five minutes of chores goal. I hope that made sense!	swtmoonlight	reply	na	na	na	0.9967302083969116	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"[Willingness](https://gerryfisher.livejournal.com/23922.html) is a DBT skill that is taught in the [Distress Tolerance Module](https://www.reddit.com/r/dbtselfhelp/comments/zrte2/dbt_the_26_skills_listed/) that helps us tolerate intense emotions by accepting the reality of the present moment and doing what is most effective right now (even when we may not want to be effective).

Greetings everyone! I recently found this sub about 10 minutes ago. I was looking for additional resources that are part of working with Radical Acceptance. I was diagnosed with BPD & Friends ( Though that is a silly way to express my list of diagnosis’s it’s much easier to say/type than listing them all ). I have the workbook you listed in the Wiki. I have a fantastic Therapist who has given me different DBT and CBT exercises to work with while I’m still waiting for an opening in the DBT Training Group. When I was added to the list for the closed group about 4 months ago, it was said there is a 6-9 month waiting list. Because I’m motivated to do and be better, she is helping me learn ways to help me gain some emotional maturity and regulation. She thankfully is certified in both CBT and DBT Training. My Psychiatrist has me medically balanced to further help me along while i patiently wait to start DBT Therapy. This past year has been painful, and eye opening. I learn something new I’ve done in my past that is a bitter pill to swallow. Most of which I have no memory of. My current husband and 3 adult boys are what keep me striving to become a better person. I spend most of my free time reading and researching information on my BPD & Friends. I’ve found, that by educating myself about my diagnosis’s I’m able to, understand why I’ve done certain things, acted impulsively to situations, etc. I’m so glad I stumbled upon this sub. As it too will help me continue learning and growing while I wait to start training, while going through it, and beyond. 😍	AutoModerator	reply	na	na	na	0.0013968878192827106	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Hi all, would love to hear some perspectives. I've been seeing a DBT therapist for about 2 months to deal with my depression. I have heard a lot about ""skills"" and ""target behaviors"", but am finding it all pretty vague and confusing. I can't figure out what to DO on a daily basis to get out from the terrible place I am in. It kind of feels like I'm in a big hardware store with no idea what tool to pick up first or how to use it. My therapist admitted in out last session that he's frustrated with me because I keep coming back to this confusion and hopelessness. I know I'm the problem, but I just don't quite understand how this is supposed to work.

I am not currently in a skills group - I tried one that was virtual with rolling start times, so they were on interpersonal effectiveness. I did not find the particular skills helpful, and the group itself felt cold and impersonal, with one member who dominated conversation, so I stopped going and I am looking for a new group. 

I'd love to hear others' experiences, particularly if you've done/are doing DBT for depression. At what point did you feel like you were making progress?

"For me, when I was at the start of figuring out DBT and my triggers, I couldn’t afford therapy. So I came up with the routine where whenever I was feeling an emotion in overdrive I’d google (for example) “tools to combat feeling ignored by friends.” I’d read some people’s scenarios and see if I resonated. I’d then google “DBT skill for feeling ignored by friends.” I’d also check subs and other places for worksheets. I eventually found “check the facts” was one of my favorite tools. 

While not having a professional to guide me made it a little tougher, it also was kinda nice that I could curate searches for DBT tools that aligned with what I needed help with most.

Things you can do on a daily basis- you can take a minute when having any emotion that’s intense and label it. You can practice when in a calm state thinking about ways to change those big emotions or identifying the obstacles to change them. You can practice mindfulness and grounding exercises.

"so the thing with dbt is that it’s a full program. i’ve been doing a lot of research and in every study where dbt was proven effective it was done in the format of a program. this means groups and individual sessions and family sessions depending on your specific needs. 

also, your therapist doesn’t seem really understand dbt. if he’s not encouraging you to do dbt in a way that a). works for you and b.) functions in the way it’s intended, he’s not helping you with dbt. he also doesn’t seem to be particularly validating, which is one of the core concepts of dbt. i would talk to him about target 2 behaviors (therapy interfering behaviors) from both parties. i would also recommend looking at this from the perspective of the transactional model, which sums up to be emotional disregulation —> inaccurate expression —> invalidation. i think that this is super important to understand bc you aren’t the sole reason that things are currently ineffective, it’s never one sided. 

i would also consider trying to find a better group and embracing some full participation mindfulness. when i started dbt we were also in the ipe module and i thought it was so dumb, now i actively use ipe on a daily basis. it a group format isn’t for you, you can find copies of skills manuals for sale in a number of places, along with free pdfs if that feels more reasonable.

i’ve been in dbt for depression and parasuicidal behaviors for two years, and admittedly, for the the first year it felt like it was doing jack shit. that’s what sucks about dbt, it’s not fail proof. you’re still going to feel shitty and engage in target behaviors even while practicing dbt. that doesn’t mean that dbt can’t be helpful. i really think you should look into emo reg skills because in my experience they’re the ones that you can feel the most immediate impact from. 

i’m not sure if any of this makes sense, just want you to know that treatment is centred around what works for you. stick with it man, you’re going to gain something from dbt."	collective_effervesc	reply	na	na	na	0.9994499087333679	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I’ve been in dbt six months for BPD and feel I’ve turned a corner. But I’m lucky the skills group I go to is good and my individual therapist is great. 

I do know what you mean though about the hardware shop and all the tools. I mostly do nothing on a daily basis (except meditation), but have found over time the homework assignments each week have been enough to shift my thinking and reprogram my brain. So that now I’m automatically considering situations a bit differently and feel more confident in my ability to handle things. 

I imagine that dbt can vary in the quality of the delivery from place to place. I’d say it’s a balance of surrendering to the process, giving it time, and also listening  to your gut if things don’t feel right. The therapist should never make you feel inadequate, it’s *their* job to come up with ways for you to learn the skills that work.

"I'm a year in and still don't see any progress with my relationship issues, which is why I took DBT to begin with. I'm curious which online group you were in because I just had a similar experience online with a group and they also started with interpersonal effectiveness. I didn't feel like this group taught the skills well at all either. Prior to this though, I graduated from a different online group and that one was way better.

For depression, skills that come to mind would be opposite action, any of the mindfulness skills, and accumulating positive events (or all of ABC PLEASE, really). Also, mindfulness of thoughts.

Is your therapist a DBT therapist? Because in DBT, they never say you failed DBT, they say DBT failed you. DBT was confusing for me for quite a while and I still don't feel like I was given thorough explanations of which skills to use when or how they all interconnect and build on each other. I asked a ton of questions in my groups so that helped clarify some things but even after a year, I still have questions and some confusion. My main issue is actually using the skills though when I need them most."	collective_effervesc	reply	na	na	na	0.9994499087333679	no	strong	strong	na	dbtselfhelp
"I've been doing a watered down version of dbt for a few years where me and my therapist pick out skills and topics that would help me with what I'm currently struggling with. The ones I go back to most often are distract, self soothing, check the facts, opposite action, dear man, and wise mind/mindfulness. 

I was in a dbt group at one point and hated it so I decided to go back to my main therapist. I think it might be helpful to pinpoint what your issue is and then explore skills in that area and see which ones work. I have bad anxiety so I tend to do a lot of distress tolerance skills. Somebody else suggested buying the workbook and I absolutely agree. I have it and use it frequently. 

I use dbt to treat my bpd. Don't get down on yourself for not understanding it immediately. It takes time to get used to it. I don't know how often you're meeting with your therapist but 2 months is pretty short lol."	collective_effervesc	reply	na	na	na	0.9994499087333679	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I’ve studied DBT on my own for 8 years. My therapists have all been CBT heavy which isn’t my vibe and I feel I’m more knowledgeable than them at this point which is fair considering I’m the one living with bipolar and pmdd and it’s difficult for them to relate.

The process was very gradual. The first thing I worked on was my anxiety with mindfulness and meditation. I prefer to take a moment to listen to something calming, relax my body, and sit with my emotions and accept them while they slowly fade into calmness once again. I personally find mindfulness to be a very accepting attitude. 

The second thing I worked on was naming my emotions while I was in social and relationship situations. Telling people how I felt was an immediate way to gain control of myself while seeking support.

The third is validating others or as I call it treat others the way you want to be treated. I don’t mind quickly validating someone else’s concerns but then I direct them back to the main issue. 

The fourth was concentrating on what I can control. It was a recent one so it still feels pretty big. But for me it was allowing other people to make mistakes and let them feel the consequences of their actions and just concentrating on my kid and myself.

My last and hardest to master was stopp or simply walking away when I need a moment to calm down and come back with a clear statement on how I’m feeling and what can help. 

Some things I did along the way were setting boundaries and consequences, processing in a journal by naming emotions + what happened + what i can do, gratitude, distraction, and treating myself with kindness.

I believe that by the end of this process you will have applied the skills in your own way for your individual problems and it will be a very personalized experience. I don’t use these skills as they are on paper in such a conventional way, but I mold them to fit my own life."	collective_effervesc	reply	na	na	na	0.9994499087333679	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"There's a lot of therapists who say they ""do DBT"" when it feels like they read a book about it 10 years ago. DBT works best in a comprehensive program.

I’m not sure if anyone has said this yet but I don’t like how the DBT therapist got frustrated at you and made you feel like you are the problem. I would recommend a new DBT therapist or support item to help you. I think it’s counterproductive for any kind of therapist to make their patient feel like they are a problem /srs /neg. I think it makes sense to feel confusion especially at how you described DBT like the big tool place and not knowing which tool. DBT and learning/starting any kind of healthy coping mechanism is going to feel overwhelming at first. I would recommend in terms of the DBT stuff starting really small and doing baby steps, and also not really adding on a new thing until you have mastered the current thing you are doing? /gen /srs. Another big thing is being patient with yourself. Relapses happen, and that’s ok. When the relapses happen I think it is important to remind yourself why you want the healthier coping mechanisms or to get better.	collective_effervesc	reply	na	na	na	0.9994499087333679	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"When I first discovered DBT, I wanted to be able to do all of the skills straight away and felt overwhelmed by how many skills there were to learn. I felt a kind of pressure to work through them as quickly as possible.

I think at the 2 month mark, I had only really done about 5 or 6 skills, and I'd only really scratched the surface of those skills

Don't be afraid to take your time. There is depth and nuance to explore in every skill. You could spend a whole month on one skill if you wanted to. I appreciate your therapist may not see things that way, and there are certain restricting factors that effect these things. But it's okay to give yourself a bit of space and do one thing at a time. It can feel awkward or forced at first, but we're all human and we're learning and it takes time to get our heads around this stuff.

If I had to give a recommendation of something to focus on getting started, I would say the mindfulness skills, because they really are like the rock that DBT is built on.

To answer your questions: I personally started noticing a difference about 7 months in. The change I noticed was that I felt more aware of how my emotions, thoughts and behaviours were connected, and I could see how it was being influenced by the world around me, and how my behaviour also effected the world around me. It sounds so obvious, but until then I really didn't fully understand that my actions had consequences. 

So then I started to be able to have more *choice*. I would notice a behaviour or a thought or a feeling, and it would be like a cross roads. I would say to myself ""okay, I can do this the old way, and I'll probably end up doing xyz and feeling worse and piss off this person. Or I can try this the DBT way. It feels unfamiliar, but these are my options, and I'm willing to give it a go and see what happens"".

Then you try the skill and see what happens. I think one ""key"" to getting DBT to work is celebrating all your small wins and incremental progress. Celebrate every time something works. It may not be the final goal, but it's a bloody good start. It may be the difference between ruminating on something for hours, and ruminating on it for 20 mins. It may be the difference between staying in bed for 3 days or staying in bed for 1 day. These small wins really matter

Edit to add: my ability to make progress in DBT was also supported by things like sorting out my housing issues, getting access to welfare and getting on the right medication.

"I don't think DBT is for depression but for regulating yourself so that you suffer less, which can alleviate depression. Something like CBT could fit better if you want to cope with trauma and stuff and I'm planning to maybe do that after DBT. I have found suitable depression medication over the past couple of year too.

I've been in a DBT group for 4 months and the idea is to practice the skills tou learn so when you need them you can use them. There are many and we don't even get taught them all. There is information about them online for free if you care to look.

The most useful things for me have been 
- practicing being present aka mindfulness ( You could just look around you and pay attention to small things or look for round shapes.) I feel more connected to the world and like a person who acts instead of just observing.
- noticing when I am judging (an annoying person is not inherently annoying, something is neither ugly or beautiful etc.)
- planning and doing nice things for myself
- learning about primary and secondary feelings. Secondary feelings are the ones that make us suffer so much. Ehen you feel angry you might actually be sad and anger is a more tolerable feeling to have
- learning to recognise my feelings. Our instructors say that anxiety is not a feeling but a state, so there are feelings behind it.
- validating others in conversation (not judging and try to react in a compassionate way instead of trying to come up with solutions or getting mad at their ""wrong"" actions)
- radical acceptance. Instead on ruminating I can now look at ways to solve a problem and if I can't, I can focus on moving on.

It requires time, effort and practice, but it will be worth it. Progress isn't linear and trying is better than not trying at all."	collective_effervesc	reply	na	na	na	0.9994499087333679	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Seconding this as a really good skill to practise when you're starting off. Labelling emotions is half the battle sometimes, and it can be surprising how much of a difference it makes to just give it a name.

Some days, I'm too drained to do a full ""check the facts"" or I don't have time.

"I had a DBT therapist in my last group say anxiety is not a feeling too, which confused me. I've found it on a lot of emotion/feelings wheels I've seen and some places online list it as a feeling. 

When you say primary feelings are less tolerable but secondary feelings make us suffer more, is that a typo or do you mean they make us suffer more because of behaviors they may lead to (i.e., lashing out when angry, etc.). Or they make us suffer more because we aren't accepting or dealing with the primary emotion? Just curious--thanks!

I find sometimes it’s easy to go quickly to Im angry Im sad Im anxious. But take it a step beyond that. Search your vocabulary to really identify. I struggle with this still sometimes and still actively call out my emotions around anger. Looking at the emotion wheel (I tried attaching it here isn’t working sorry!) is a good little tool for digging deeper into your emotions. Like is it sad or is it maybe lonely or guilty or powerless or vulnerable etc and then identifying that can help you target how to take care of it

If I would listen to my wife's opinion about her therapists, she wouldn't have one. It's tough to gauge if that therapist was bad just on OPs reporting via a few sentences. It is very typical of a client in a depressive fog to not be able to get and realize the problems and solutions. Now after 3 years of therapy and a year of DBT, she is now turning a corner with her presence and understanding of her own problems and that space in her mind now allows her to use simple tools from her therapy effectively.

"| primary feelings are less tolerable but secondary feelings make us suffer more

this is a quote from our instructors and materials. Say, you're angry because your friend stood you up. You might not actually be that angry but rather sad because you feel like your friend doesn't care about you as much as you hoped. Anger is an easier emotion to deal with.  


Radical acceptance is hard and I hope you can learn to use it. I had a crush on my friend and we parted ways for over a year (I didn't know if he hated me or not) only for him to come back and want to be my friend again and now we're barely speaking.

"If you’ve not tried a mindfulness practice yet, that’s a good place to start. Mindfulness is the foundation of DBT, so finding a practice that works for you and actually practicing regularly will be very useful. You can just google some exercises and try them out. It’s kind of frustrating in the beginning, don’t get discouraged. 

In the next step (or if you’ve already got a good grip on outward mindfulness) you can try to be mindful of your emotions and practice identifying them. When you’re feeling an emotion, try to describe what it feels like in your body, what thoughts accompany it, how it affects your perception, what impulse to act it brings with it.

I'm reading Mindfulness for BPD by Blaise Aguirre and he recommends for people just starting out to practice a minimum of 20 minutes of mindfulness a day, which can be split into two 10-minute sessions. He says after you've been practicing for a while, you should gradually increase the duration to 30 minutes or longer each day. He also notes that incorporating a formal meditation practice daily is also key to integrating mindfulness into your daily life. I thought of your question when I read that tonight and thought I would share because I've had the same question myself. Not sure if that totally addresses what you asked.		reply	na	na	na	0.0032641279976814985	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"This is something I feel I could really benefit from starting to do more of. I'll be honest that so far, I've only completed one ""formal"" chain analysis and it was probably 8 months ago when that was our homework that week for the group I was in at the time. I remember it taking me a long time to complete (maybe 2 hours?) and feeling confused about how much detail to go into/how many links, etc. I'm sure it would have helped if I had had an individual therapist to walk me through it, but I didn't and don't. I tend to go over and over things I do wrong and try to figure them out in my head, but I'm sure writing it all out and actually writing in at what moments I could have used specific skills would be a lot more helpful! I believe in individual DBT therapy, the standard is your therapist makes you complete one any time you engaged in a target behavior."		reply	na	na	na	0.00408815685659647	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Just a comment on some of the other comments i read below....

i think part of the point of the behaviour chain analysis is to remind the person that they are the actor- they make the choices and do the behaviours-

and so it's reminding the skill practitioner to put themselves back in the driver seat of their life....to work through helplessness or blaming others or circumstance... it reminds the skill practitioner to let go of giving up their agency...their power!!! 

of course support or someone else's reflection can be helpful but don't let being afraid of ""doing it wrong"" stop you from practicing being/or wanting to be- the driver of your life...meaning how you act and what you do. It's just paper.. so I would argue there is no wrong and lots to gain??

"I'm super embarrassed. I just got into a 2nd car accident in as many weeks, this time it was not my fault, someone was rushing southbound across a street who I didn't see, they hit my rear left wheel. In my stupid, stupid panic and shame I got his phone number but did not take a picture of his license plate or call the police. I know, I'm an idiot, and now my family is carless.

I'm feeling super guilty and don't know what skills to use. I did pros and cons for not using a target behavior so in that sense I am being skillful.

I'm unmedicated for my ADD right now bc I'm pregnant and wonder if I need to be medicated since my inattention in car accidents was what led me to being diagnosed. Meds aren't recommended in pregnancy unless the individual has trouble functioning and I'm wondering if the car accidents qualify as me not functioning.

My husband is also very frustrated and mad at me that I didn't get the right info after the accident. I feel like even though the accident wasn't my fault now the whole situation is because I didn't do what I was supposed to, I feel like it was poor logic/impulse control and I'm not sure what skills to use or how to repair."	nikitamere1	post	22.570639316540873	female	White	0.9991944432258606	na	na	na	8	dbtselfhelp
"I'm so sorry to hear about your car accidents! It sounds like a super stressful situation. 

The first skill I'd use is to try and look at the situation in a Non Judgmental way. You refer to yourself as stupid, but reading your situation back I don't see any evidence of you being stupid at all. 
Check the facts and do it non judgmentally. 
Some facts I can see - you're pregnant and not on your regular medication (medication that specifically helps you with driving). The accident wasn't your fault. 
You made a mistake in not getting the details but Everyone makes mistakes and especially in a high stress situation such as being hit by a car while pregnant! 

After you've checked the facts I'd also look at radical acceptance. 
The accident has happened and unfortunately it seems the person at fault is not going to be honourable in the situation. This sucks for sure, but try to avoid adding more suffering to the already not great situation. Focus on what you can do to fix the situation, not on the what ifs and should haves. 

Then I'd do a Pros and Cons list for the medication while pregnant. I've never been pregnant and I don't know what the side effects of this medication would be for you and the baby. I'd do a Pros and cons to see whether the risk is worth the pay-off. 
Also, I'd consider whether driving is safe while you're pregnant and possibly not able to take medication. Maybe do a Pros and cons for that too? 

And finally, I'd try to relieve some of the rumination by practising mindfullness. My personal favourite is to go for a walk or to draw 

I hope it all works out for you. You definitely aren't stupid for being in this situation"	nikitamere1	reply	na	na	na	0.9991944432258606	strong	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"So I have ADHD and I'm trying to get pregnant... anyways please note I'm not a doctor, just someone who researches this wayyyyy too much. Definitely check out /r/mentalhealthbabies if you haven't and you'll see a lot of people taking prescriptions during pregnancy. Basically it's impossible to have an ethical study on what drugs are safe during pregnancy so you're going to have difficult having peace of mind on any particular thing. 

Even strict doctors will say pregnant women can have up to 200 milligrams of caffeine per day, so you MIGHT want to experiment with using caffeine before driving for a short temporary stimulant boost. 

Lastly, for DBT self help and mantras, remember this is a weird time of year. People are driving to strange places and unfamiliar routes during the holiday season. I could drive to work blindfolded but going to a shopping mall or relative's house is going to throw me off my game and I'll make more mistakes.

"Mindfulness is the foundation of all other skills, so you need to cover that first. All other skills won't really make sense without it.

While there’s no rule, besides starting with the mindfulness, I think reviewing the distress tolerance section before going forward would be helpful.

"Personally, I liked the order that this book went in. For me, distress tolerance skills are the easiest to learn and have the fastest impact, so I liked doing that first.

I think distress tolerance is also often taught first when problematic coping mechanisms are an issue. A lot of mindfulness and emotion regulation work involves sitting with difficult feelings. If you have an ingrained pattern of responding to difficult feelings with negative coping mechanisms, then this type of work can be a little risky. Like how you often have to demonstrate a level behavioral control before you can start doing EMDR, because it is going bring up difficult things and if you’re not super in control of your responses it can be dangerous. At least that’s how I think of it.

If you’re not struggling with any major behavioral responses to distress, then it might not be so important for you to start with distress tolerance.

Really, I skip around a lot anyway. I read it all in order, but I haven’t practiced every single exercise in order.

I've never used McKay, so unfortunately I don't know what therapists' usual course of action is. The other three modules don't really interact with one another so honestly you can probably do all 3 chapters without problem. I think it's just personal preference, honestly--I'd prefer to stick to one all the way through just so I don't have to read through all the basic skills again to remember how to navigate the advance/explore chapters, but if you prefer to cover all basic skills first, I don't see why not.

"Well the principle of opposite action definitely is not always or never, we know that of course. Just a reminder that it’s a means to an end that can and should be dropped when it’s unhelpful, picked up when it’s helpful. Just in case some of that distortion is creeping in.

my thought too is maybe try describing your current writing process in objective terms (the stick to the facts exercise). Like if you included how far along you are in pages (like the book is written out up to page 1 or 59 or 0 or 500,  and just noticing any self-criticism show up). Or however you want to define the facts is great. And then compare that to a realistic goal and you have some objective figures you could keep as information:)

Also I like to externalize time by setting timers of work and breaks and marking my calendar for targets. If it’s getting to be too much, and you have the luxury of no deadline, even better! Meet yourself halfway, thank your emotional and rational minds for showing up to the table. Be the awareness to facilitate the shaking of hands and a warm embrace.

"What exactly is your emotion? 

My understanding is that Opposite Action is for “opposite to emotion action” in DBT. It’s for when the emotion doesn’t fit the facts, which you determine by checking the facts first. 

If your emotion fits the facts, my understanding is that you’re then supposed to engage in problem solving. 

When I was in more of a CBT program focused on behavioral activation and with DBT skills thrown in, I think they taught Opposite Action as more of just trying to get yourself to do behavioral activation/more effective actions when you don’t feel like it (like when I want to lay in bed rather than doing the laundry - I use opposite action to help me get up and do the laundry despite not feeling like it).

Either way, the main question is - what’s effective? 

Is it effective to lay in bed instead of doing laundry? Probably not.

Is it effective to write so much you burn out? Probably not. 

It sounds like you need problem solving. My understanding of dialectical problem solving is to first determine your goal, then come up with any and all possible solutions, and narrow down to what would best accomplish your goal.

It sounds like you need to break it into pieces. Make it realistic. Writing a page every day may be too much, or it may be ideal. Only you can know. I’d adjust as time goes on - continually reassess, and remember to practice loving kindness toward yourself."	Traditional_Food_217	reply	na	na	na	0.9571797847747803	no	no	strong	na	dbtselfhelp

"Most of the time I find it most helpful for me to complete a check the facts before engaging in opposite action. There are DBT handouts about how to determine whether Opposite Action or Problem Solving is appropriate based on what comes out during the check the facts.

After I check the facts, I can say what the emotion is that I am trying to regulate more effectively, what the action urge is I'm getting from that emotion, and whether the emotion fits the facts. If it doesn't and I go with opposite action, then I can identify how to practice opposite action based on the emotion and action urge.

Without sorting all that out first, it is hard for me to determine what opposite action is appropriate or feel like I have the wherewithal to engage in it.

"I'm in a situation where my whole life as I knew it(daily routine, partner, job, city and long-term life plan). Have all changed in the past week, all in one day pretty much. I also recently found out that the situation I moved into? Is not as stable as I first anticipated, and will only be able to stay here for 6 months maximum. If that. 

I'm on the autistic spectrum so this is incredibly stressful for me. I understand it would be for most people as well. I am feeling *very* anxious and am completely unsure of my next steps. In terms of mid/long term planning. I usually latch onto any stability I can find as a way to sooth my anxiety? But have been advised not to by my therapist, and I agree with her. I've been trying opposite action and self-soothe? But to little effect. Also been working very hard to maintain PLEASE skills, which has been helpful but isn't quite as magic as I wish it were(haha).

I understand that these types of changes are hard and it's probably not totally reasonable to expect myself to be well enough to do more complex planning type thinking when I'm experiencing this kind of stress? And do wish I had an extra day or two to really give myself some space. To maybe grieve skillfully or build positive experiences(can't remember full skill name)? But it's unfortunately not the situation I find myself in. I need to start trying to at least find a job asap. If not other housing solutions as well. But needing to find other housing right *now* may be just the anxiety talking. 

My therapist is off for the weekend and we don't have another session till Thursday. I'm looking for any other skills that people may have used in similar situations? High stress with little breathing room combined with a need to appear as normal as possible. Or wondering if there's any little extra brain tricks people have found that are still largely in line with DBT.

My list of coping skills are as follows:

1. Reach out to my safe people and vent

2. Stress clean

3. If I can't do either, phone the crisis line and tall it out, cry it out whatever. 

4. Take a day or two off from it all to just do self care and regroup.

For stress and anxiety my go tos are mindfulness and meditation and processing. I’m mindful of my emotions and I allow them to be. I accept them as part of the situation and cry if I need to. Meditation is very helpful for me and I prefer a full body relaxation technique from head to toe relaxing each muscle group slowly as I breathe in a out. My processing technique is journaling my emotions + what happened + what I can do. Things I can do are usually my favorite coping skills, favorite hobbies, venting to a friend or relative, and getting into nature.

"I don't know if this is just the nature of my workplace or what - I tend to find that being clear and respectfully assertive isn't very effective at my work. People are very covert about stuff, prefer to go about everything in a roundabout way (make little comments, big hints, quite passive-aggressive).

There've been a few times where I've done what I think is the right thing, following DEARMAN as best I can. The response I get is stonewalling. More recently they just made eye contact and smiled; conversation over.

That's the point where I feel very triggered. I want to assert my autonomy somehow (usually in a way that doesn't benefit me in the long term). I don't, I just stuff it down and get through my day. But it's having an effect on me not being able to have any say on my workload, and those emotions aren't going anywhere. I end up feeling angry and eventually that anger makes me feel depressed and unmotivated.

I understand the next step logically (when triggered) is distress tolerance. But this is a long term issue about my workload, this is where I work and these concerns are practical and I'd like to change them. But how can I change them if nobody will listen to me?

I understand some of this is vague, but can anyone relate to having DEARMAN be consistently rejected? How am I meant to navigate my job with dignity if people don't respond to me being reasonable?

Don't forget to start by exploring what your priority is: getting what you want, maintaining the relationship, or maintaining self respect. It sounds like you are trying to get what you want but your need to maintain the relationship is taking priority.

"Thank you for replying! 

I'm deeply worried about seeming unreasonable or unstable. This workplace is somewhere I've had my most public emotional breakdowns. I'm trying to turn the tide on how people maybe see me by keeping it together. 

I worry that if there's a rift between me and someone else I will automatically be blamed, because I'm like the identified patient, 'PTSD girl being unreasonable', even if my complaint is valid (It's tricky to know how much of that is based in reality and how much if it is just my fear, it's definitely a little of both).

I'll give some thought about what you said. One thing with these recent incidents is that I'm a) very emotional about the workload problem b) very emotional about not being listened to so many times, so I need to calm down a little first.

I will also add that you can be doing the skill perfectly and that doesn't always mean other people will respond skillfully themselves or respond how we want them to.

"I've had a very hard time finding a comprehensive in-person DBT program in my area that takes my insurance (or any insurance!). So far, I have completed about a year of DBT skills group through a couple different online programs. I have learned a ton through the online groups, but have not seen much improvement yet. I actually seem to have gotten worse with my relationship which is why I started DBT to begin with. I realize this is not ""full"" DBT and so I am probably not getting the potential full benefit. 

I finally found a nearby in-person skills group that starts in January, but it's only 12 weeks long. They also don't use the Linehan book, which gave me pause. They use **The 12-Week DBT Workbook: Practical Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills to Regain Emotional Stability by Valerie Dunn McBee**. I wondered if anyone here has used this. Also, has anyone benefitted from such a short in-person group? This won't be comprehensive DBT either since the one individual DBT therapist at this practice isn't currently accepting new clients. It's fairly reasonably priced, so I'll probably try it out. They must skip a ton of skills and go over things quickly though if it's only 12 weeks long. 

I did find an individual therapist somewhere else who claims she does DBT. I have my first appointment with her next week. I don't think her practice is a comprehensive DBT one either but I'm hoping she actually does practice DBT and know it well.

"How long were the online programs you did? If they were about 12 weeks and you didn't find it helpful, I'm dubious another 12 week program is for you. I'm sorry you can't find DBT resources where you live; it's a common frustration and I hope you find someone/group soon. If you haven't tried this, it may be worth looking at any licensed DBT therapists in your state (rather than your local area) and whether they hold any longer programs online, which seems to be increasingly common, at least where I live. 

As for your relationship/other issues, most therapists advise you that you'll get worse before you get better, so I hope that makes you feel better! Therapy also means that you're learning how to stand up for yourself, set boundaries, etc and and any change in a relationship dynamic is bound to make things feel worse, just because it's new. Maybe this doesn't apply to you at all but I just don't want you to feel like things went south because of therapy/DBT. 

I also think this subreddit, because it's composed of people who benefitted greatly from DBT, sometimes make it seem like DBT is the end all, be all. The truth is that unless you have BPD (and even then, there are alternative options!), a robust program and/or professional which/who specializes in another therapy is likely to help you just as much if not more, albeit in a different way. For example, there are therapists with yogic backgrounds who teach many skills eerily similar to DBT, especially mindfulness--after all, Marsha Linehan herself admitted she basically copied that part off of Zen and yoga. Similarly, DBT is cobbled together from so many other psychotherapeutic branches--CBT, behaviorism, social learning theory, etc. Because of this, I honestly believe in quality above all else--if you have world class gestalt therapists in your area, for example, they are likely to be more effective than an ill trained DBT therapist. Personally, my DBT definitely would not have been enough and I'm really grateful for all the other therapies I've engaged in, from executive function coaching to psychodynamics.

Yeah, seems like you've tried it all. If you've done a longer program, I'm honestly very dubious that a shorter one would help, but if you have a knowledgeable therapist/mental health professional, maybe you could ask them to review the credentials of the therapists leading the groups. One of my former therapists actually had her entire PhD process (advising, dissertation, licensing) overseen by Marsha Linehan, and I noticed a huge difference in quality between her DBT classes and some other programs I had done. So that might be worth looking into--what creds people have. You may just be a person who needs a more nuanced or focused program, in which case something like creds are important. In the end though, everyone's constrained by their location, so if you've tried every option available to you and don't have a lot of choice in therapists in your locale, unfortunately I don't have any advice. 

This sounds really tough though, so best of luck with everything! Hope you can find the program you're looking for :)"	MarshmallowCat14	reply	na	na	na	0.9977645874023438	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Something that causes issues in my relationships is that I expect an specific reaction/response and when my loved ones don't follow the *script* I *wrote* in my mind, I get upset.

If they don’t react or reply in the way I was expecting, I assume they hate me and don’t give a fuck about what I was saying.

I know logically that sometimes what I want to talk about is boring or not interesting to others, so it’s normal and ok that they don’t react with the same interest as I do. But I can’t “let it go”.

DBT has helped me improve my communication with them but I'm not sure what skills would help me with this issue. Any tip is appreciated :)"	Dognuthatter	post	32.21198868898421	female	White	0.9863850474357605	na	na	na	15	dbtselfhelp
"DBT is at its core about embracing the duality of thinking. Two or more things can be true at the same time. You expect X to feel cared for. That's true. Others do care but don't do X. That's also true. Instead of only thinking ""it's normal that they do this"" you can take one step ahead and force yourself to look for other signs that they care for you/find you interesting/etc to at least cushion the feeling that your exact expectations are not met. This is similar to 'Check the facts'."	Dognuthatter	reply	na	na	na	0.9863850474357605	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Remember that it’s not a personal attack on you. I go through the same thing sometimes with one person. I used to take it much harder. I realize now that it’s ok for people to not always be as interested in something the way that I am. Because there’s things people are interested in that I really don’t care about and they might want to talk about it but I’m only gonna listen so much until I start to look a little bored too. 
It doesn’t mean that you’re not important or the things that you like aren’t important. But we  can’t expect people to basically be our parents all the time where everything we say and do is met with admiration, awe, intense validation, applause, and 100% focus. We BPD sufferers often try too much to parentify people and make them give us the intense unique parental love we either didn’t get it or that we didn’t get enough of. And when we don’t get it we feel immediate abandonment, shame, emptiness or judgment.
Remind yourself that your hobbies interest goals dreams and personality are valid. Love yourself and be your own parent. Remind yourself that the things you like are pretty cool. Tell yourself in your head that you did a good job when you do a good job on something. That way any compliments, love, or validation from others is just the cherry on top."

"I mean you're already recognizing it so that's half the battle!

One thing I've noticed about reddit in general is it's common to expect a lot from people. Your average person is not a therapist, they are not going to say the right thing, give proper empathy and room for your problems. If you're lucky, they'll give an anecdote about an ex-girlfriend's ex-husband who had the same problem and that's their way of making conversation and trying to show they care. It doesn't work of course, but there's a lot of times where saying the ""proper"" empathetic thing would just shut down the flow of conversation.

As for the people not paying attention, switching the topic, etc. Sometimes they switch topics when they don't want to talk about uncomfortable things. My mom will do this a lot and I've discussed toxic positivity with her but you can only do so much. But it doesn't mean they don't care, just means they're not always equipped to give you the support you need.

"Good advice.

I recommend Wise Mind WHAT and HOW skills.

Emphasis on the nonjudgmental mindfulness of what’s going on. Like above comment, check the facts about what you’re feeling, which should allow you to recognize you’re in emotion mind and move to wise mind. If your emotion doesn’t fit the facts, opposite action helps - rather than let your anger increase, act kindly and mindfully.

Yeah, non-judgment struck me as a the core problem here.

"Hello!

We did positive vs negative reinforcement in DBT today, as part of the interpersonal effectiveness module. And I kinda dissociated in the session after being triggered by something. I was trying to understand when they were teaching and discussing Extinction and Satiation but I don't actually understand what the terms mean and what the difference is. Can someone please dumb it down a little and explain? And use examples as they help? Thanks!"	AwkwardPotat0	post	42.58491621471691	female	White	0.9982568621635437	na	na	na	3	dbtselfhelp
"I'm a behaviorist, degree in behavioral sciences and can explain these concepts, but not necessarily in respect to DBT in particular.

Extinction means that the behaver engages in the behavior and no longer gets access to reinforcement for the behavior. The behavior had to have been previously recieving reinforcement in the past, and be decreasing gradually now that it is not receiving reinforcement. This can be frustrating and have side effects such as emotionally and aggression, referred to as ""extinction burst"". A good example is a vending machine: you press a button, you put in money, you SHOULD get your candy, but you don't. You might try to push the buttons harder, etc, to try to get the candy you should've gotten. Another example could be talking yo your friend. Say you talk to your friend every Tuesday on the phone but one day she doesn't pick up the phone. You don't know why this is happening, and every time you dialed the phone in the past to call her, the behavior was reinforced and you got to talk. You engaged in the behavior, but didn't get the result. 

Satiation is when a reinforcer occurs too much, effectively, so that it decreases the VALUE of the reinforcer. You get sick or tired of it basically. You eat too much candy, you get satiated, you no longer want to take a bite. This impacts your behavior by decreasing it as well, you overdid eating candy and now you longer want to engage in candy eating behavior. At least, for now. With the friend example, say you talk to your friend every week. You may run out of things to talk about. Maybe a week is too frequently to do this. Every time you call, your friend picks up. But now conversations are less reinforcing because there is less to talk about, so maybe next Tuesday you don't feel like dialing the phone because you're just not feeling it. 

Let me know if that helps at all, there's more I can elaborate on and make more relatable."	AwkwardPotat0	reply	na	na	na	0.9982568621635437	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

Iv been doing some research on DBT and seems to be the best treatment option.

Yes 100% DBT is a lifesaver and I think everyone who needs these skills with BPD needs to get it! We were never taught proper emotional regulation in our childhoods so it can feel pandering sometimes but it's so so important we relearn EVERYTHING from the ground up and DBT gives you that opportunity. Then one day you will hopefully be able to communicate in a healthy manner and it will definitely improve your relationships and mental health.

"DBT *has not* given me greater understanding of the causes or effects of my BPD. Individual and process group therapies have helped me understand what happened and how my BPD continues to affect my life.

DBT *has* helped me diminish the intensity of my symptoms and improved my social interactions.

👉 If you want to improve your symptoms, work with DBT or mentalization therapy. 

👉If you want to understand the causes of your BPD, work with a therapist with expertise in treating BPD, and whose work is informed by psychodynamic or transference-focused approaches.

DBT groups and process groups are also helpful.

"It seems like a number of skills involve a component of paying attention to the way emotions feel in your body. That was initially a hard concept for me to grasp, but I’m coming around to it.

The problem I’m having now is that it seems any time I’m feeling any particularly strong emotion, I cry.

Then I feel certain things very strongly in my body - the tightness in my throat, tightness in my face, shakiness. It’s hard for me to identify any other physical sensations relating to the emotions themselves. Just the crying.

Has anyone experienced this and found a way to feel their emotions in their body while crying? Or do you sort of have to wait to stop crying before you can do that exercise?

Okay, I’m worried this is too much of a “DAE” post and not enough of a real question. Sorry if that’s true! But if anyone has experience working through this it would be nice to hear.

Thanks."	sadnessthrowaway62	post	22.457923917389284	male	White	0.005921461153775454	na	na	na	8	dbtselfhelp
I get this. The sadness and crying might be a secondary emotion from frustration. It sounds like you’re struggling to connect to the root emotion which causes frustration. Try checking in with yourself more often throughout the day as well as scheduling crying sessions to help yourself grieve whatever you need to grieve	sadnessthrowaway62	reply	na	na	na	0.005921461153775454	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Sometimes when I'm feeling things deeply, lots of other suppressed emotions like to come up too. That's why I cry sometimes when I'm mindful of my emotions. 

I dip into the intensity for a bit, then if it gets too much, I use distress tolerance and grounding skills to dial it back, then maybe I dip back into the intensity of it for a bit, then I ground myself again. I go back and forth - I guess that's a dialectic.

Sorry, that might not be helpful. 

Maybe paying attention to the crying sensations is enough in the moment? Can you explain more about why you want to feel more - is it about identifying which emotion you're feeling so you can do emotion regulation? 

Lots of times I have to do distress tolerance first before emotion regulation skills will work for me"	sadnessthrowaway62	reply	na	na	na	0.005921461153775454	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

Procrastination and avoidance have always been target behaviors for me but especially lately and looking for some DBT help. Specifically for me right now it’s avoidance of reading/responding to text messages from family members (cannot bring myself to do it for some reason and it’s been days); but also looking for skills tips and recommendations for procrastination in general.

"So DBT skills can *technically* be applied for procrastination and avoidance, especially if your problem is underlying anxiety/another emotional issue.

However, as someone with both ADD and BD, and had to get treatments for both, I tend to think of procrastination as an executive function issue (which gets compounded with anxiety for me), in which case executive function coaching will be *far* more effective than DBT. I think it really depends on the underlying cause of your procrastination--if it's really an emotional problem rather than an executive function one, DBT will help, but if the latter, DBT honestly wasn't developed for executive function issues, so you might be better off looking into executive coaching."	catye_luna	reply	na	na	na	0.9978893399238586	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

What treatment did you get for your ADD? I’m on meds right now which help a bit but I’m still struggling with executive function. I’m thinking of getting an ADHD coach potentially.	catye_luna	reply	na	na	na	0.9978893399238586	no	strong	strong	na	dbtselfhelp
"I was on medication for a bit, but honestly it was pretty bad for my anxiety and caused some wild mood swings. If you're open to medication, I'd highly recommend trying it because it's the treatment that requires the least discipline/effort from you. 

Eventually, I found an executive function coach to work with. It's sort of like therapy--it takes a few years to undo some bad habits, realize what works for you, and learn healthy ways to get through procrastination and other executive dysfunctions. It also requires analyzing your thoughts/behaviors/emotions and how it affects the way you approach your work. 

It's very much like DBT in that it requires you to have discipline in your life and keep practicing, but personally, I prefer it to the way medication made me feel. But I think it's really up to you--medication is probably cheaper (my coaching was not covered by insurance) and doesn't require you to put in time and effort to find what works (except the time and effort to find the right meds, which is sometimes a painful experience lol)."	catye_luna	reply	na	na	na	0.9978893399238586	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

if you have anyone to talk to that you know will have a calming effect (regardless of what you discuss, your episode or your new favorite show on Netflix), absolutely do that.
what I've learned in the past year, although interactions with others can cause most of the greatest distress in my life, it also has an infinite capacity to soothe me, as long as I choose who to talk to right. it didn't always work, but I'm learning to trust my gut more in who to reach out to when im feeling adrift."	iamtryingtobewhole	reply	na	na	na	0.005543393082916737	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"I'm sorry you're so distressed at work! Everyone makes mistakes, so I hope you feel better about it soon ❤️ 

Being new to DBT makes it a little difficult because I don't know how many of these terms will make sense to you, and DBT skills are a little hard to learn by yourself. It sounds like you've covered distress tolerance if you're keeping yourself distracted. 

Ultimately, distress tolerance skills are basically band-aids to a surgical wound--it works in the short term because you're too emotional for anything else, but long term healing requires other skills. That's why you keep feeling bad in waves, and never feel good--distress tolerance isn't there to make you feel better, it's there to stop you from doing anything worse. I'd gauge your crisis level and keep using distress tolerance skills if you're truly in crisis, but otherwise switch to different skills. Remember there are three criteria for a crisis: your emotions are in the ""red zone,"" you can't do anything to make the situation better, but the situation *can* get worse. 

If you feel okay enough for long term skills, I'd look at the following: radical acceptance (accepting you've made a mistake and there's nothing you can do about it now), dialectics (acknowledging you messed up but recognizing people mess up everyday, and having empathy and kindness both to yourself and others), check the facts (make sure you're understanding whether the mistake was big/small and making sure you're not distorting the facts), and cope ahead (bracing yourself for a worst case scenario and preparing to deal with it in an healthy way. Note that this is *not* the same as spiraling into despair). 

I hope some or all of these skills help. If you're in crisis, I'd also text/call your therapist--they're on call for this reason! :) Wishing you the best of luck with the new job."	walnutmercury	reply	na	na	na	0.9994183778762817	strong	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

Could you elaborate on the cope ahead skill? I’m super interested as I just made a work mistake like OP and am not quite as anxious but feel like I need to really have some grace with myself.	walnutmercury	reply	na	na	na	0.9994183778762817	no	strong	strong	na	dbtselfhelp
"Sure! Just a reminder that cope ahead is supposed to be used when you're no longer in the ""red zone"" of emotions, so don't use it if you still feel high anxiety (this especially is a skill that I need to avoid if I'm in distress, so just giving extra warning lol). 

Basically, cope ahead is a skill based on a bunch of studies that show humans do something better when we visualize and internalize what we're going to do. The example study my therapist showed me were a bunch of soccer players who were more likely to win a game when they were asked to imagine winning a game.   

To use the skill, you basically ask yourself, ""okay, what is it I'm afraid of?"" (This needs to be within the realm of reason through the check the facts skill) and ""how will I deal with it if this happens?"" You need to imagine it in as much detail as possible--eg. what the other person says, what their facial expression is, how you're going to respond, your facial expression, etc. be mindful of the emotions that flow through you as you think of this scenario, and try to channel it into reacting effectively to them (in your head). The more you visualize and prepare for what will happen, the more likely you'll actually stay composed/whatever your goal is when the worst case thing happens.  

You might want to supplement this explanation with a DBT handout sheet (it'll be covered under emotional regulation--it's the C of the ABC skill) in case I missed any steps, but this is the gist.

"As my title says, I’m looking for any dbt skills that are suited for navigating conversations with people from my past.

For ex. I did poorly in a class I cared about last semester bc of mental health, etc. recently, I ran into the professor, who asked about getting coffee or meeting to talk about how I’m doing, what happened, ways I can get a better grade retroactively.

I really want to follow through with this, but I would like any kind of framework for how to approach people/actions that I would normally ghost or ignore with all my might. I want to be more present and compassionate with myself while also moving forward.

I have a therapist I can ask about this (and will bring it up next week), but I was curious if anyone had tools that helped them in similar situations.

This might sound out of context. I would most likely use Opposite Action for addressing the feelings when meeting another person like your professor. I would be nervous for example. So I would try to be more confident for the opposite action. If I was more skillful in Interpersonal Effectiveness I would also use the Dear Man skill. I am not advanced enough skill wise to use Dear Man skill/s to their full extent. That's why I would personally put more of my effort towards Opposite Action. There is a time to practice, and a time to use what is effective. I think taking some deep breathes and using Wise Mind may help you figure out what skill/s to use that are effective for you.

I think if you actually got a minute you might have a pretty good time perception.

I have a fun idea I wanted to share! So, there are four modules in DBT from what I remember. Each to be used usely based on current emotional intensity level. I am going to buy a bookshelf with 4 seperate square sections. I will start with each shelf from the bottom up. That way it replicates the emotional intensity scale which goes ; Mindfulness 0 to 25, Interpersonal Effectiveness 25 to 50, Emotional Regulation 50 to 75, Distress Tolerance 75 to 100. I will label each shelf with these stages. Then place my module packet of information with each appropriate shelf it goes with. I will include any extra items for each individual shelf for if they help increase effectiveness of that module through their use. I hope that makes sense! It is a project that will take time and may shift with skill levels/increased skillfulness over time. I will post a pic once I actually have the bookshelf. That way if anyone is confused by what I mean I can label the shelves and literally show you. Thanks guys! If you have any ideas to try out I would love to listen.

"One of the things I love about DBT is that even though the handouts are serious, some of it I can have a bit of light hearted fun with. I'm thinking of the handout for emotion regulation skill ""accumulate pleasant events"". There is a massive list of suggestions for ""pleasant events"", and one of them is ""thinking, I am an okay person"". Every now and then, I'm going about my day and I think ""I am an okay person"" and it always makes me laugh a little bit."	AutoModerator	reply	na	na	na	0.0012529852101579309	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"I wish I could share a picture of mine here, but I don't think I can! The mod shared some resources below, but basically--grab a box, basket, bag or whatever container you like and fill it with items that appeal to your 5 senses (smell, sight, touch, sound, taste) that you feel might help calm you down or ""soothe"" you in moments of distress. 

I actually have a larger self-soothe box at home and a ""to-go"" mini self-soothe kit that I keep with me in my purse. In my to-go kit, I have 2 or 3 essential oil roll-ons, mint chapstick, a small larabar for a snack, a worry stone, a pen and I usually carry a small word search book with me in my purse. 

My home kit has quite a bit in it (I went a bit overboard because I had fun making this and expanding it over the last year, lol)--favorite candle, adult coloring books and colored pencils, pumpkin spice linen/room spray, favorite smelling lotion, a photograph of my cat as a kitten, a mindfulness word search, crossword puzzle book, a few books with uplifting sayings and poems, a book with photographs of kittens, my favorite tea and hot chocolate and a mug, a snack, fuzzy warm socks, a soft blanket, etc. I also have some bath stuff--scented epsom salts and lavender bubble bath. A lot of people in my group also had an mp3 player or headphones for the sound sense. 

Now I just need to make myself actually use it when I am in distress instead of my go-to behaviors that make things WAY worse! I use my to-go kit a lot more often, like sometimes if I'm going into a doctor appointment or standing in line at the grocery store, I'll put some of my essential oil roll-ons on and it kind of helps distract and ground me a little."

"I have been trying to practice checking the facts and dear man the past few weeks. I have a certain situation with my sister where I feel like I reach out to her more to contact and organise face to face meetings. After doing a few rounds of checking the facts and letting the time go by, she hasn't reached out to me and I did a few days ago but she cancelled it because she was exhausted which I understood and told her I missed her and wished to see her soon instead of pouncing on her. We call weekly/biweekly but don't text much. I decided that I wanted to communicate a need to her and have gone through the DEARMAN sheet but as I'm completing it now I'm not quite sure if it is something I should bring up with her or not because I understand she is busy and maybe I am letting my abandonment issues play into it too much. The last time I saw her was about 1.5 months ago but I would like it to be a bit more frequent or even have a plan started for when we can see each other next which hasn't happened yet...

This is what I came up with for DEARMAN:

 Describe the current situation: we haven’t met each other recently/you haven’t reached out to ask to meet with me recently

Express: I feel distant when we don’t see each other (should I explain this further?)

Assert: I would like us to put more effort into seeing each other or try to plan to see each other. (can discuss how frequently)

Reinforce: I would really appreciate it if we could do this in order to build a positive bank of memories in this relationship

Mindful:  be mindful of the goal of this conversation i.e. to see each other more

Appear confident: 

Negotiate: if we can not see each other more could we communicate online a bit more or set a time every week to call?"	laome97	post	28.629802692733367	male	White	0.002596745267510414	na	na	na	9	dbtselfhelp
This sounds reasonable, and I relate to it bc I had to ask family members to do similar things.

I think this sounds very reasonable. You sound like you've taken time to consider what you want. I think the key to this conversation being healthy is mindfulness. You need to be mindful of your goal, maybe you should expand on your goal and really dig deep into that feeling. You can't be negotiating with your abandonment issues first. You need to be negotiating with the goal of closer/less distant relationship with your sister.	laome97	reply	na	na	na	0.002596745267510414	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
I think adding what she might get out of it is a fantastic idea, and OP can probably think of some really valid reasons for sister to want to spend time together too!

Yesterday I tried to radically accept that when I drink alcohol, I feel like a bad mom. Can I radically accept something positive, such as the fact that I  a good mom?	kmcroberts	post	18.310126401544373	female	White	0.9922866821289062	na	na	na	33	dbtselfhelp
"I’ve used radical acceptance to face something I’ve avoided or that I lied to myself about. I think one criticism I’ve seen with dbt is the tendency of some people to say, oh that’s not me I was in “______ mind.” 

In coping articles, they say that when you cannot admit how you feel, you can never really get to asking yourself WHY you feel that and if it’s justified or you are mistaken. This is when people use dysfunctional coping skills and mask their real self. In light of that, I see radical acceptance useful to admit how I’m feeling and try to get to the issues beneath that feeling. 

Example: I FEEL LIKE A BAD MOM WHEN I DRINK. Is this justified? It might be if I put my children’s health or safety at risk by driving them intoxicated or not attending to them. It might be justified if I appear intoxicated and teach my kids that being drunk is normal parenting. If I leave my children with unsafe people so I can drink it might be justified.

If your reason for feeling bad is simply, “parents don’t drink” or “there is no way to drink responsibly” then, you should examine the source of those beliefs."	kmcroberts	reply	na	na	na	0.9922866821289062	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I don’t think radical acceptance is necessary for positive things. 

After all, it’s a tool for when you’re struggling with something. 

Radical acceptance around drinking could look something like this ‘I accept that at the moment I’m drinking more than I’d like’, in other words you’re accepting the facts as they are, laying them bare, not denying or bargaining, just saying the truth to yourself. It doesn’t mean you want it to be this way or approve of it, you’re just not fighting reality. 

That way you can go from there and start healing, once you have fully admitted and accepted where you are. 

In terms of the fact that you are also a good mum, that could look something like ‘Most of the time I do a good looking after my kids’. So you’re balancing the two, which is very much what DBT reminds us; that two things can be true at once; we can make mistakes *and* be trying our best, we can be doing the best we can *and* we can do better, we can make mistakes while parenting and still be a good parent. 

Hope that helps."	kmcroberts	reply	na	na	na	0.9922866821289062	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Radical acceptance is for facts. Zero judgements. For example. That sweater is orange is radical acceptance. But saying that sweater is ugly isn't radical acceptance. That's a judgment. Perspective puts things in a positive or negative judgment. 

You could say when I drink, I am not available to my children. You could also say. I only drink once a month and I am there for more children 99% of the time. I think you are probably looking at check the facts more than radical acceptance. 

Radical acceptance is for accepting painful events. Like abandonment, death, poor diagnosis, etc. But you are maybe trying to radically accept that you are an alcoholic? Hard to say with the little information."	kmcroberts	reply	na	na	na	0.9922866821289062	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

If you want to recognize that you are a good mom/person, you could try ""engage the Dialectic""- even if you have aspects of you that aren't perfect, you still are (I'm sure!)

Anyone needing help with emotional regulation should NOT be drinking alcohol or taking drugs. This is DBT 101. We don’t even get onto skills until the substances stop. Emotionally we are similar to toddlers - we have no business getting drunk (especially not when we’re moms on top of it).

I think Mindfulness practice like breathing exercises could be helpful. They might help you not give in to the urge to drink some of the time. Drinking is the action urge. You can radically accept the action urge without accepting doing that urge. I don't want to assume you are an alcoholic. If you need help though with drinking maybe look into programs to help with that. I don't necessarily think you are a good or bad mom. I don't know you well enough. You can be a good mom AND have drinking issues. You can struggle with drinking issues AND seek out help for those drinking issues. I think the AND statements are dialecticals I just gave. I am sorry you and your family are having issues like this. I believe you can improve, and that it may take time and a lot of effort. I think you can make it through this to more stable ground.

"I'm wondering about your statement that radical acceptance is not necessary for positive things.

What about a situation where somebody holds a belief about themselves that deep down there is something wrong about them, if shame or guilt is present at the foundation of their psyche? 

It seems to me that if such a belief runs very deep then embracing something positive about oneself can be a difficult and confusing idea. I imagine it might feel like 'admitting', kind of like admitting to wrongdoing, because it clashes with the more fundamental belief held about oneself connected with shame. Wouldn't you agree that there might be some for whom it is so hard to accept a true positive fact that it can be comparable with the trouble others face to accept an aspect of reality which points to something negative?

I don't disagree that principally radical acceptance is meant for facing a hard truth and then go for a more effective behavior. As I understand in ""I drank alcohol and in that moment it limited me from being a good mother to my child"" the tension is between ""I want to be a good mother"" and ""I failed to be who I want to be because I drank alcohol"" so it is hard to accept because it projects badly on oneself. But now, I imagine there might be a situation where there is a clash between not positive to negative but reversed, e.g., ""I believe that deep down I'm a terrible mother"" and ""Today I managed to refrain from drinking alcohol because I chose to be fully capable of taking care of my child"". If the negative belief is very strong it can be very hard to stick to such a fact because the connection might feel wrong ""I acted like a good mother because I refrained from drinking alcohol so that I would be capable of taking care of my child"". 

Feelings are not facts, but then sometimes feelings might feel like facts and if I understand the point of the skill of radical acceptance is to go with the facts despite them contradicting a strong feeling. My point is that if there is a strong negative feeling then it might be hard to accept a positive sounding fact that is at odds with that negative feeling. So maybe then radical acceptance is the way to go, is 'necessary'?

TLDR; If there is an underlying belief of shame then can accepting the reality of having done a positive step be sometimes as hard as accepting having done something negative despite believing oneself to be a good person?"	kmcroberts	reply	na	na	na	0.9922866821289062	no	no	strong	na	dbtselfhelp

"Yes you have to be careful there. I’m a social drinker when I drink. I normally have a two drink limit as a general rule and have exceeded it. If I’m having a great time I can put away some alcohol. A co-workers husband likes to drink. He routinely would get black out drunk with two young girls aged 6 and 9 in the house when strange men were drinking with him. She would come home to the wreckage of the party and even people passed out while her daughters were trying to get ready for school. Imagine.

Part of managing behavior is to PLAN right? I think if you set a three drink max limit unless you have a sober, trustworthy baby sitter and no chance of funny business happening to your kids, you will have a boundary you can live with.

Accept you have a drinking problem and it’s hurting your child - a good place to start. One of the biggest problems with substances is that people only believe they have a problem once they’ve lost everything. Do you want your child to see you drunk?

"OP, I completely agree with u/WaterWithin that the skill you're *actually* looking for is dialectics. Dialectics tells us that there's no ""bad mom"" or ""good mon""--everything is more nuanced than that. That you can be doing great, but that everyone has room to grow. I really think that radical acceptance is the wrong skill here--it's a skill about facts, and ""I am a good/bad mom"" are objectively opinions. 

In addition, I think you need to problem solve the drinking a bit--make a pros/cons of drinking and non drinking. Does one outweigh the other? There's nothing wrong with not drinking at all, and there's also nothing wrong with drinking in moderation. You'll probably find the DBT crowd a little anti-drinking because it's a therapy originally designed for BPD folks, who are much more likely to become alcoholics compared to the general population, and the program in general discourages the use of substances (PLEASE skills). But that doesn't mean you have to follow every DBT skill, and I encourage you to do what will make you happiest in the long term. 

Finally, I'd like to emphasize I'm not trying to shame you, but I will note that the definition of alcoholism by the [National Institute of Health](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/moderate-binge-drinking) is a minimum 8 drinks per week for women, and it does sound like you're slightly higher than that, so that might be something you consider for long term health. In addition, a limit of 4 drinks doesn't seem an unreasonable/OCD limit--5+ drinks is medically considered binge drinking and is not advised so 4 is a perfectly healthy limit to have. It definitely sounds like you have a lot of negative feelings/self-berating which is *not* okay, but I'm also not sure it's okay to tell yourself it's normal to have 5 drinks--that's just objectively not medically advised. I'm just checking some facts--it sounds like you have a lot of thought distortion about this, so I'd like to emphasize it's perfectly OK to drink (up to 7 drinks a week!!), but at the same time, maybe 12 a week is something that can be adjusted (for your health more than anything about your mom skills!)."	kmcroberts	reply	na	na	na	0.9922866821289062	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
It would be, but I struggle with that. Also trying to figure out my relationship with alcohol. Sometimes I convince myself that having that 4 th drink won’t upset me but it does. In reality, I probably need to just not drink, but that feels really hard. I was sober for 14 months due to anxiety alcohol caused and then I was pregnant. Had a drink last New year.	kmcroberts	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9922866821289062	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Aren't you going beyond what OP shared by advising to accept having a drinking problem?

It is up to OP to carefully search the facts and assess how for drinking is a problem and what is it's effect on the child. A further exercise in radical acceptance could be to face the details of the facts 'Today I drank xyz amount of alcohol'. From what I saw so far OP didn't state any factual data on how much drinking is meant by ""more than I'd like"". Taking a sip is already more than they'd like for somebody who doesn't drink at all and this is an example where your cautioning about hurting their children would be going too far.

The first thing that OP said was ""I just get intrusive thoughts that I’m a bad mother."" OP, first of all kudos for labeling it as an intrusive thought. Second, imagine your friend drinking as much as you do but they don't suffer from intrusive thoughts of being a bad mom. Are they drinking too much? ""I drink more than I like"" can mean an euphemism for drinking way out of line which indeed would be hurting your children. It can also be a concealed self-judgment which is just supplying the belief ""I'm a bad mom"" which is present notwithstanding the circumstances and the facts. So which is it? Well... Does it matter? Drinking is not necessary. So why not keep it simple and just do without it? If you do it will be also easier to practice mindfulness to tackle intrusive thoughts. 

I feel awkward about the comment you received. It is clearly coming with good intentions but it seems to put quite a lot of pressure while ultimately you have to assess everything and make your choices for yourself. From what I read, Linehan stresses understanding why something is a good choice and liking the prospect as opposed to being forced into it.

"I agree that it seems important: feeling distressed from intrusive thoughts ""I'm a bad mom"" can make it easier to overindulge in drinking. 

OP, great that you are working with a psychologist, they will help you find some way forward. Forgiveness sounds like a great idea, it can be super transformative and liberating. If I may add, what might be an easy intervention is to tackle the urges to drink with a metta meditation. Best choose your own but it can be something opposing your fear for example because your intrusive thought pertains to you being a mom: ""May I keep my child safe, may I love my child, may I feel the love of my child"". What do you feel is better, a few rounds of such loving-kindness in your self-talk or feeling numb from a few rounds of beer? A kind metta meditation of your choosing is a) yummy and b) can support you on your pathway towards forgiveness.

"Some reformulations to say what I identify as judgements in this comment:

* ""is probably not ok""
* ""You're losing touch with reality while you *should* be present""
* ""Your psychologist's job is to..."" (and seems it is implied that not the fact that your psychologist gave you a positive appraisal?)
* seems to imply: I'm/We're telling you the hard truth
* ""you probably have a problem""

Sorry, but given what OP relayed to us, I don't see how these statements charged with urgency are going to be helpful to OP. OP is already trying out radical acceptance which is a positive effort. Why not give her some space to see where it will go? Sure, in many cases viewing drinking as a problem is the necessary first step towards improvement but if drinking is not excessive it can be regulated without risking imposing onto somebody feelings of guilt.

Yes, to me too 4 or 5 beers seem like a lot, and yes, -personally- I would choose to stop going this far. But it would be counter-transference to project my views and choices onto OP. Note, that it seems that OP seems to be aware that drinking might be a reason to worry but at the same time she did consult this with others.

I wouldn't say they're directly on forgiveness. But loving-kindness teaches you to love everyone, even people you hate. Radical acceptance teaches you to feel less intensely when you've been wronged in some way. Dialectics teaches us there's truth on both sides.

I realize this also may not be amenable to how DBT is practiced either...but wanted to hear your thoughts before delving into it.

"I don’t have as much experience (though I do have some) with ACT but I have tons with DBT. I actually went through the whole official program.

To me it sounds like DBT is pretty much exactly what you are looking for. While yes they skills training portion is in a classroom like setting, it is also very, very hands on both inside and outside of the classroom. It is also very much “here are the steps you need to take”, and those steps are primarily implementing the DBT skills you learn to resolve whatever issues are on hand. 

There is also a decent amount of overlap between DBT and ACT. DBT is sort of like a combination of a number of different types of therapy (CBT and ACT are some examples) and it’s all evidence based.

If you can, I would highly recommend seeing if there is a DBT clinic close enough to go to. You can find one on one therapists that are DBT informed outside the clinic but in my own personal experience (and in watching my partner trying to do it this way) it’s not nearing as effective because they don’t have the same level of training that those at the clinic do."

My therapist uses ACT with me. I’ve also been going through a DBT workbook by myself. There are some similarities - both feature a big emphasis on mindfulness and acceptance.

I’m also a step-by-step person when it comes to dealing with issues and DBT is great for that. When you have a problem you essentially choose which skills will be the most helpful and apply them, it’s very methodical in a way.

"I lucked out with an incredibly good skills teacher (she has even worked with Marsha Linehan herself). She did a really good job of explaining not only what the skills were, why they are needed and how to implement them. You are also given homework each week (which was mainly just practicing the skills we were taught during that week’s session). Nobody likes HW obviously but it really did help a lot. The more you practice, the more automatic the skills become and eventually it just feels like second nature. It’s in a group format too so seeing how other people implanted their skills and getting feedback and such also really helped cement things. I never used to be big in groups but I was pleasantly surprised by how helpful it ended up being.

In short, yeah, the hands on portion definitely made sense to me. You can also always ask the therapist you end up with (this is a twice a week thing, one for the skills group and the other is one on one with one of their therapists) to go over specific skills if you are having trouble with any or are still unsure of how to use them and they can help you out.

For me, some of the skills were very straightforward and easier to understand, and others are trickier for me (like Radical Acceptance and Wise Mind, for example).

Maybe centering mused in wise mind to determine if I believe this is what I want and I feel safe attending this studio.

In general, I think only you can answer what the wise mind thing to do is--no one here knows you nor your parents. For e.g. if you're financially dependent on them, maybe catering to their wants/needs is important to make sure you have housing/food. Or maybe they're not enough of a type to fly off the handle that you think you can put your foot down without causing too much trouble, etc. My point is that no one can tell you exactly what to do because we don't have the full set of information about your relationship with your parents.

Opposite actions for loneliness are things like going to a social event, reaching out to a friend or family member, basically anything that puts you in contact with people, thereby giving you the opportunity to reduce loneliness.

Kind of like stewing in the symptom/s of loneliness instead of trying to move on.

As mentioned, I have done DBT once before for 18 months. I was smoking weed and not engaging at the time however though so I am thinking of re-doing it. Has anyone ever done it a second time round and found it effective when they didn't do it properly the first time?

I’ve been through DBT classes several times, and my biggest takeaway is that it’s only as effective as you want it to be. When I wasn’t taking it seriously, failing to practice, etc., I didn’t notice any changes. On the flip side, when I was actively participating, taking notes, and practicing my exercises it damn near changed me. I’ve been out of DBT for about a year and a half and I still use many of the practices I learned to help with emotional regulation and black and white thinking. My relationships are better, I can sit through strong emotional responses, and I have a more stable sense of self. While it didn’t fix everything for me, I do think taking DBT seriously was one of the best choices I’ve ever made.	Ill-City-4237	reply	na	na	na	0.7531196475028992	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
I've done it several times at this point both in a therapeutic setting and just me with my dbt handbook. You see humans learn by repetition,, the more you do it (and actively engage and implement the tools) the more it will stick. So Yes you should definitely do it again and again and again if need be eventually you'll just start doing it out of habit. Like I said I also have the dbt book from my group setting several years ago and I take about 2 months to get through it on my own and do the little exercises it recommends.  It's worth it to me and nothing wrong with doing it multiple times. We didn't learn our poor behavior overnight it took us lifetimes hence why only one round of dbt probably won't be as effective as several rounds. Am I making sense? It takes a long time to untrain and retrain ones brain.	Ill-City-4237	reply	na	na	na	0.7531196475028992	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"I think it would definitely be worth a try if you weren't engaging the first time. I took a DBT skills online class for 11 months. I enjoyed learning the skills and having some support, but I honestly did not really see any improvements and many weeks, I felt like I was getting worse. However, I didn't have ""full"" DBT and only had a skills group. I am trying to find somewhere else to re-take it at the moment. I did try to engage but it's a lot to learn the first time through, let alone to really implement into your daily life. Also, I was having a lot of really bad relationship issues the whole time I was taking the class, so some weeks, I really didn't even try or found it hard to pay attention to group or practice the skill at all.

Anyway, one of my favorite quotes from this short yet profound book is:

""One thousand days is said to be learning. Ten thousand days is said to be refining.""

"Thanks! I was writing a long response and my computer froze up. I had not heard of the dime game but I will look that up. 

I do need to do more chain analyses. I've never had an individual DBT therapist, unfortunately. I took 11 months of an online group skills class but that's it. I am still looking but so far, I can't find an individual therapist who does actual DBT and also is accepting new clients and takes my insurance or ANY insurance. It's incredibly frustrating. The class did quickly go over how to do a chain analysis but I felt like it was rushed and it's so hard for me to want to fill one out on my own every time I mess something up! I do analyze and go over and over things in my head about what caused it, etc. but it never seems to help. I will keep trying though. 

I'm almost always super mad when I feel like my boyfriend is lying to me. I grew up with a narcissist dad who constantly lied and my last boyfriend was abusive and lied constantly. My current boyfriend isn't like that at all, but I still think he is lying all the time! I used to believe him when I calmed down but now I really am not even sure. Yesterday was horrible. I was in an obsessive, anxious, rage for almost 20 hours! Texted him over 300 times while he was busy doing schoolwork. When we're together, I've thrown things, I've hit him. It's not like just some contained anger I have when I can go self-soothe. It's not good. And I always feel bad for days afterwards and tell myself not to do it again, but it's like a switch is flipped in me and in that moment, I no longer really care and feel barely in control. I'm not like this when I'm single.

Radical acceptance is one I haven't really mastered yet and I need to work on more. When I get angry, I quickly become extremely angry, so a DEAR MAN doesn't really feel accessible to my brain in that moment. 

What happens when you're actually with a person though? Like, do you just excuse yourself for a moment or leave? I feel like I can't just go dunk my head in a bowl of water while talking to my boyfriend? lol. Although at this point, he probably wouldn't think anything strange and I'm sure he'd prefer that to me freaking out at him."

I've actually thought about doing this. I live out in the woods on a gravel road, so it's quite easy to step outside and do something like this without anyone noticing. I've heard contradictory things about throwing things, screaming into a pillow, yelling in your car, etc. Some places recommend that but I've also heard doing things like that can intensify the anger. Regardless, it would be worth a try and better than throwing and breaking things that have actual value to me like i have been doing for the past year.

Yes, I was thinking about that piece of the chain analysis where you have to think about where you could have used skills and how important that piece is and how I'm definitely not doing that part when I analyze and ruminate in my head. I think you're right--that's probably the most important piece to making a change next time. Also agree with you about writing it down probably being a lot more helpful that going over and over something in my head! That gives me hope to hear you started seeing some changes after only doing about 10 chain analyses!

"Shadow boxing is essentially ""sparring"" with yourself. Theatrically, you have the boxer with a light casting his shadow on the wall.

By going through the motions, ducking, weaving, jabs, and swings the boxer can watch their moves. Make corrections and discovery possible moves and reactions.

When you described your process, I immediately thought of a mental version of shadow boxing.

If interested I found instructional vid on shadow boxing, https://youtu.be/i12A6G_LiJo .

My boyfriend of a year broke up with me. He was my first everything. My family loved him, I love him. Last night I got a TEXT saying he simply lost attraction for me. I died inside. I've been crying ever since and I need to focus on school right now. I'm trying so hard not to be self destructive. I'm afraid if I use tipp I'm not letting myself feel anything. And radical acceptance is too hard to do atm. I feel so lost, what should I do from a dbt perspective?	animaluv4040	post	28.034008208111736	female	White	0.9986271858215332	na	na	na	19	dbtselfhelp
"Feel your feelings!!!! Sometimes it's too hard to practice all our skills because we haven't processed the emotions yet. It's 100% understandable that you're shocked, devastated, angry, whatever else you want to feel.

Write them down and maybe you can track these emotions back to times in your relationship you felt that way. But, you don't have to make sense of your feelings. Let them come.

Be kind to yourself, treat yourself to a relaxing bath or even a nap. Eat some ice cream. You can get yourself through this, it might not be a linear path to getting through it, but you will.

"I was reading “DBT Skills Training Manual” by Marsha Linehan yesterday, written as a guidebook that includes teaching notes for each DBT skill for therapists to use. There was a note there about using crisis survival skills: “At times, it is more effective to reduce feelings immediately than to experience them fully.” I immediately thought of this when I read that you didn’t want to use TIP skills in fear of not letting yourself feel anything.

If giving in to your feelings and feeling them fully will make your performance in school worse, then it is not effective. Therefore, if I were you, I would go ahead and use crisis survival skills to reduce your emotions to a manageable level. Once you’re not in Emotion Mind anymore and are not too aroused and hellbent on destructive urges, then you can practice Emotion Regulation skills like Mindfulness of Current Emotions, Problem Solving, Opposite Action, etc."	animaluv4040	reply	na	na	na	0.9986271858215332	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Last year I had my partner of 2 years break up with me over text too - it’s super shitty. It’s completely normal to be devastated right now. You’re grieving the loss of your partner and the future you envisioned with them, as well as the pain of rejection by someone you love. It feels like you’ll never be okay again.

Validating how you’re feeling and thinking is super important, especially in the beginning. Try not to suppress any emotions that come up. Reminding yourself that it’s understandable to cry and miss them and not be as focused right now. Your brain chemistry is actually being affected. Because of this, it might cause you to slip into negative thought patterns. Challenging these negative thoughts by intentionally thinking kind thoughts about yourself (journaling is great with this) will arm you with ways to “check the facts” during a negative spiral.

Everything else will come with time, so for now try to focus on feeling it and being super kind to yourself. Lean on your loved ones. If you aren’t already in therapy, it can certainly help to talk to someone, too. The r/breakups discord was also a great resource for me to vent when I needed to, especially in the very beginning when the pain was so raw.

"so i’m starting dbt selfhelp, got the notebook, i’m writing the skills down etc - there’s just a few details i wanna iron out 

so firstly, when working on the skills, is it too much to work on all the skills at the same time? ik you’re supposed to do it everyday but there are so many acronyms and shit. are you supposed to work your way thru one skill in each category at a time & find out what works best? 

secondly ^^ how are you supposed to do that every day? like, apply the skills into your day to day life- i don’t mean that in a “it’s too hard” way, i literally just don’t know how to apply it to non-crisis situations."	disastrous_crumb	post	28.48044859560008	female	White	0.9966915845870972	na	na	na	5	dbtselfhelp
"DBT programs are usually anywhere between 26-52 weeks. You should plan out a ""syllabus"" of around that length. Usually you cover one skill (aka handout) per week. That should give you a guideline for how much to plan out for the week. Just go through the book, one handout by one handout. I'd recommend not skipping around and just following the handouts in order for simplicity's sake. 

Practicing everyday is a goal, but not something that's necessarily achieved. Try to practice one skill everyday for a week, forgive yourself if you miss a couple days, and move on to the next skill. 

Only 1/4 of DBT skills are specifically for crises (the distress tolerance module). The rest should be applicable to *all* parts of your life, not only your crises. DBT, like all therapy, is about optimizing your quality of life, not only about handling crises. Some skills (e.g. ABCs PLEASE; pretty much any emotion regulation skill) are explicitly not for crises and can only be done through daily practice. Moreover, the most important time to practice these skills are when you're NOT in crisis. The more you practice and ingrain these skills, the more likely you're going to turn to them when you're actually in crisis. *That's* really the crux of what the skills are for. So if you actually look through the worksheets, you should be able to find ways to apply them to small moments in your daily life. 

If you're not able to, that really brings me to what I tell every person here trying to do DBT with no prior training, which is that part of DBT's proven efficacy is the *amount of hand-on work clinicians need to do during treatment*. Please keep in mind that a complete DBT program has two components: individual therapy with a DBT practitioner AND group therapy led by a DBT practitioner. It sounds like you're doing neither, so you should be aware of the enormous challenges you have trying to attempt this alone. I'm all for trying to do the worksheets, but you should do it know that it unfortunately won't be as effective as going into a DBT program. As a matter of fact, if you can get a CBT therapist first as a placeholder, honestly that will probably be more effective than trying to enact a DBT program by yourself with absolutely no knowledge on the topic.

If cost is a problem, finding a program that has sliding scale/financial aid is huge. I was part of a financial aid program and paid $17/week for my group therapy. I didn't take advantage of their individual therapy but with my income level, therapy would have been $42/week. Compared to their full costs ($125 for group, $250-325 for individual depending on your therapist's qualifications), their financial aid program was a lifesaver. Keep in mind insurance wasn't involved at all because I didn't have any at that time. So therapy can be quite cheap if you can find the correct resources.

After finding an in person DBT program where I see an individual once a week and go to group once a week, I’m not sure I would’ve ever been able to do it on my own. A lot of my negative feelings towards group come from “I shouldn’t be here. I shouldn’t have to be here learning this thing.

"Group is my favorite part of DBT!!! I'm so excited for you; I hope you find it a comfortable place to be in :) 

I was a kid to was at the bottom of the social ladder; when I was in school, I was considered a ""nerd"" and my sister (hung out with cheerleaders and the jocks) once told me that me that I needed to stop hanging out with ""weirdos"" because it was embarrassing for her at school. Even I felt really at peace and comfortable at group, so you have hope! There were all sorts of people in my group--different levels of education, different social classes, everyone from addicts to people who didn't even know slang for weed--and we all felt like we were friends throughout the process. We were all sharing stories that weren't necessarily our proudest moments, so I hope that eases your embarrassment. 

As for feeling hopeless, that's totally understandable--I think a lot of people who go into DBT feel that way. Unfortunately, I can't guarantee you it'll ""work""--nothing is foolproof when it comes to mental health treatment. But every step we take gets us a little bit closer--at the very least, it'll get you closer to your goals, and you should feel proud of yourself for taking the initiative to get a little bit closer to adequate self care :)

"Let me start by saying I'm not here to suggest that the worksheets themselves are silly or unhelpful, or disparage anyone at all who likes filling them out. I myself know that things stick better in my head when I write them down, and I love that the worksheets exist to help you apply skills. I actively *want* to use them. I just can't get over the emotions tied to the semantics. Being told to ""fill out a worksheet"" feels so...childish. Like I'm an elementary-schooler doing homework. I know it's just a word that doesn't matter, but conceptually it already embarrasses me so much to have to learn/be taught fundamental life skills that the word ""worksheets"" is just icing on the cake. I get so ashamed and worked up thinking about it that I actively hide my workbooks and never physically print out digital sheets to write on, even in times where I know for a fact it would help me. I don't understand why my brain fixates on this so much or what to do about it. Any advice?"	astrogeist	post	24.20665626412411	male	White	0.9985144734382629	na	na	na	18	dbtselfhelp
"I have also experienced embarrassment over doing the worksheets, along similar lines to what you described.

The way I looked at it was to use a comparison:

I know many adults who did not get their English and maths qualifications when they were at school and are doing them now, later in life. Sometimes people are embarrassed about this. Some people in my recovery program struggle with reading and writing, and sometimes they are embarrassed about this.

How would you respond to someone in this position, who maybe struggles with reading, or didn't get their high school qualifications? Would you shame them? Or would you be compassionate? Maybe the school system let them down. Maybe they had stuff going on at home that made school hard to keep up with. Maybe they had to leave school to start earning money. 

Whatever the causes were, it's not too late to go back to education later in life. In fact, I think it is a brave and courageous thing to do. To say ""I missed out on learning these skills when I was a kid, but I'm not giving up on myself. I want to learn so I can do the things I want to do in life and not be held back, and I'm going to do whatever is necessary, do the homework, take the exams"". 

Could you apply this perspective to yourself?

If this doesn't work for you, another trick I use is to think about adult contexts where any sort of sheets/ form filling is used, and try and think of DBT sheets as falling into a similar category.

For example: in various jobs I have had to fill out various sheets like cleaning records, accident forms, planning sheets, time sheets, evaluation sheets, etc. Adults fill out worksheets all the time, if you extend ""worksheets"" to include these things. In the same way that I would record workplace accidents (for a functional reason), I record my skills practice. The difference is that no one else is seeing it, and it's not mandated by my employer, but it's functionally similar. Your DBT is your work, and your sheets are what you fill in to make sure the job is done properly, and keep a record for later if it's needed for reference."	astrogeist	reply	na	na	na	0.9985144734382629	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"First of all, I just want to validate your embarrassment, not because you need to be embarrassed, but because it IS really tough to have to learn life skills from a worksheet that feel like they should just come naturally! 

I think validating yourself and using some radical acceptance and willingness might be helpful here. Also maybe opposite action. Like yes, it feels childish and embarrassing, and, that makes sense given your previous experience with worksheets has mostly been learning things as a kid in school and given that life skills feel like something you should have just absorbed growing up and aren’t something everybody in your life has needed to learn through worksheets. Then being willing to try printing them out and using opposite action to print them out. 

This is probably going to sound very unrelated, but bear with me. I had a similar issue with the name of the birth control pill because it felt invalidating of my sexual orientation and because I wasn’t using it for pregnancy prevention. I felt so silly that this was an obstacle for me because it felt less valid than being afraid of more tangible things like side effects. In the end, I brought it up to my therapist and psychiatrist and OBGYN and they all validated my fears. I also worked to remind myself that there WERE valid reasons, like things ingrained in me by society, for me to have the feelings I did. In the end, it took some time, but radical acceptance and validating myself, along with just giving myself time to come to terms with it, was most helpful for me."	astrogeist	reply	na	na	na	0.9985144734382629	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

One thing that can get around this feeling is doing something like a bullet journal. Or writing your feelings free hand. I still use the prompt but I try to be more expressive with it. I also like drawing the charts myself and reflecting more on a situation ""negative thing, how I reacted, what I could have done"" etc. In the end it looks more like a to-do list with the end result of me setting more boundaries or working through my problems.

Of course that IS the truth. But there are other ways to frame it, too. I think improving ourselves is always admirable. We don’t expect everyone to have the same background or skills just because they’re 18+ and done with the worksheet-land that is school. If you’re on a big mission to improve yourself, of course you’ll need special tools because most people aren’t even trying, even though we could all use some work on ourselves. How cool is it that you’re doing that. 

Also, practically, maybe paper worksheets are an old-fashioned format, but adults do fill out worksheets for their personal lives, like mood trackers and food logs and chore charts and budgets and such, not to mention timesheets and checklists at work.

"I have been trying to work on my radical acceptance skills and also creating a cope ahead plan. I don't always know how to pick what things in my life to radically accept and what are the things that I can still change *if* I work hard enough. One area in particular has to do with my medicine. I have been trying to get off of some of my medicine and the most recent one I got off of my doctor told me to take when I'm in a crisis. I was in a crisis the other day, so I took it. I admittedly felt defeated by this. That if I was more skillful, I could have made it through my crisis without my medicine. This makes me think, how do I know which parts of me do I have to accept as set and which parts of me can I change? 

I hope that makes sense. If it does, how do you know the difference between what to radically accept and what can you change about yourself?"	Alainasaurous	post	36.42127497468372	female	White	0.004672589711844921	na	na	na	10	dbtselfhelp
"Radically accepting something and changing something aren't mutually exclusive. You can do both. In fact, in DBT radical acceptance is often the first step in changing something.

The thinking goes like this: radically accepting something is not agreeing with something, liking something, or even being passive to something or giving up on something. 

Radically accepting something is just that: accepting the reality, the facts, for what they are. Acknowledging the many causes that led to things happening in that way. Acknowledging that the past has happened and you cannot change it, only how you feel about it and what you do now. Allowing yourself to experience sadness, disappointment and even grief in response to letting yourself observe the facts of whatever it is that feels unacceptable. Observe if you are acting willfully and imagine how you would act if you really accepted the thing.

Once you have radically accepted something, you are in a much better position to consider change. How can we change something effectively if we are in denial about reality? Accepting something that is problematic gives us more insight into the facts, the causes, and our emotions surrounding it, which can be really helpful if we want to make change that is in line with our goals and values, and not just a knee jerk reaction.

If you want to change something, I would do the flow chart in the emotional regulation handouts. First check the facts. Does my emotion fit the facts? Yes/no. Is acting on my emotion effective? Yes/no. If yes and yes, then you have some choices: avoid the problem, act on your urge, or use problem solving to brainstorm different options (then choose the best two, do pros and cons, then try the best option). 

If the emotion doesn't fit the facts or if it's not effective to act on it, then you can try opposite action to reduce the suffering caused by the emotion and urges.

""" 

I also like to look at things in this light. 

It's okay that you took your medicine when you were in crisis, you can't go back and change it. All that matters is what you do with that experience. What are you going to do tomorrow? What will you do the next time it happens? What can you do to lessen the cause for crisis? How can you observe your emotions? 

I always tell my addict friends, hey it's okay that you relapsed. You can't change it, all that matters is what you do with it. What will you do tomorrow? 

You can't change something you already did. No use stressing about it. Just look towards tomorrow.

"It depends on what the medication is for. I could be wrong but I’m getting the feeling that it’s some type of calming medication for when you’re in emotional distress? If so, this is my advice:

I don’t think you should just accept that you’re reliant on medication, although they can still be a last resort. The whole point of DBT is to learn coping skills for those moments of distress, so with time and practice hopefully there will come a day when you don’t need them anymore. For right now, just keep doing the work and practicing your skills and don’t use the medication unless it’s absolutely necessary, and little by little you’ll find yourself needing it less and less."

I know some people take Adderall during pregnancy and no judgment to people who do, but I'm trying to get healthy coping mechanisms in place and do what I can. 

But for radical acceptance, sometimes you can accept things you CAN change. You just have to think of what to do going forward. You were in crisis, you used medication you were prescribed, better to just accept it instead of beating yourself up about it since it already happened. Chances are your big issue is just making sure you're not overly dependent on it so the frequency is more important than anything else. I would just keep moving forward, doing what you can to PREVENT a crisis from happening or deal with uncontrollable ones better.

Thank you for your answer!  My medicine that I took (saphris) was my antipsychotic. This is one that my doctor let me stop taking after I had gained a bunch of weight but said that if I have a crisis, then take it again for a day or 2. It took about 24 hours to work. I had never taken it like that before. It was something that I took everyday. But, I was proud of myself for getting to stop taking this medicine, but I had been feeling so bad these past 3 weeks that I wasn't being very skillful. I was using unhelpful skills again. Now I feel like I'm having to start all over again, because I didn't use enough or the right kind of skills. I don't want to have to use it for crisis again because then it might have to go back into my every day medicine again. I want to use my skills. Not sure if this would impact your advice?

"""more of a step than an outcome""

That definitely describes my experience of practising the skill. I like to think of radical acceptance as something that gives me a bit more wiggle room around painful things in my life. Each time they get a little bit easier to accept. And having that space gives me the freedom to have more choice over how I respond. Sometimes I practise accepting the same thing many times. It depends on what it is I guess :) it's one tool in the toolbox.

I think practising thinking dialectically can also be helpful? Two things that seem to contradict, but are both true at the same time.

For example, you can accept yourself just as you are right now, AND work to improve yourself.

You can forgive yourself for doing something you regret, AND  make plans for how to do things differently next time.

You can love yourself AND you can get mad at yourself sometimes 

You can be doing your best with using skills, AND have ways you can do better.

Dialectics for me really are the bread and butter of DBT and sometimes when I get stuck with skills, it helps me to go back to this."	Alainasaurous	reply	na	na	na	0.004672589711844921	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Wow, thank you so much!  I really, really, really like how you think about radical acceptance.  I have been looking at it the complete opposite way.  I thought once you radically accepted something, that you were accepting that there is no more changing that thing.  But, maybe that's just one way TO radically accept something?  Or that's the conclusion you draw AFTER you radically accept something?  Like, ""well, I checked my facts, and it looks like there's no changing the results no matter WHAT I do, so I must radically accept this.""  Like that?  

I want to be able to get to the middle road one day, where I can see things from more than just one thing or the other.

"This isn't from DBT, so I'm not sure how healthy it is?? To be completely honest? 

So I used to work at Starbucks, by far the worst job I think I've ever had? And I've had a lot of bad jobs. One of the reasons it was so bad was you were not just encouraged but expected to go above and beyond with *every* customer. To never tell a customer you can't do something. Whether it's the 4th remake of a latte or a $5 gift card because they mobile ordered to a Starbucks down the street. 

The way I rebelled was to be very cheery. I would smile and do everything they asked that I feesibly could do. I realized a lot of people would insist on ridiculous requests as some kind of power move? So by doing them cheerfully and quickly without blinking an eye? It worked wonders. They would come up to the counter fully ready to argue with me about thier long af nearly impossible latte order. Then I wouldn't react and get to watch them deflate as I said ""Oh no, that's no trouble at all!"" over and over. This worked especially well with angry/irritable customers. Once they'd start yelling at you and I'd keep smiling with no malice and say things like ""I'm sorry, sir. That kind of language and volume is inappropriate for the comfort of our other guests. I can get you (blank) but will need to ask you to be more respectful of the space."" acting totally calm. They would usually get embarrassed and either calm down OR walk out pretending to be too angry to continue. 

If the demeaning customer happened to *like* that I acted so servile? I would only say what absolutely needed to be said and make eye contact with their ear when I did speak to them. Still acting super cheery of course! The smiley batista who is incredibly kind and chatty with everyone *except* you? AND even though they're looking at you it feels wrong and unsettling?? Seemed to work really well to deflate the people who """"know"""" they're better than you.

It kept me employed and feeling mostly sane? It also made my good interactions even better, which helped to make things easier. I called it ""radical kindness"" and built a whole little personal philosophy with it. I'd totally forgot about it till I saw this! I'm going to check in therapy if this is cool? But would love to know other people's opinions.

"Just to clarify: what are your emotion urges? What are you thinking to do when you say you're using opposite action? 

One of the most important things I learned in DBT is that all emotions are good in moderation. Envy alerts you of things you don't have, so if you're motivated to go reconnect with your friends more, pick up a hobby like photography or hiking (even if it's for better instagram photos), lead a healthier lifestyle, etc. a *little* bit of envy is probably good. At the worst moments of my life, when I had dropped out of school and was homeless, I wanted to at least graduate college like the rest of my friends, and I think that motivation was a good thing, y'know?

If your emotion urge is to start passive aggressively bully your friend and tear her down, that feels like a less wise decision to me. You're destroying a friendship that you (presumably) value. So it's a little difficult to tell you to act (or not) on emotion urges when we don't know what they are. 

As for skills, in the short term, it's clear that her social media makes you spiral a bit, so I'd practice STOP if you ever feel like you're in a scroll spiral on her page. Liking (and maybe commenting) on the most recent post is okay; looking through years of her photos is not. 

It's also clear you feel your life is lacking compared to hers in some way, so I'd work on the A and Bs of ABCs. I'd especially look over the ""values and priorities"" handout and fill out a ""values to specific action steps"" type worksheet if you have access to those."

I wonder also if you could reframe your feelings as admiration and use her as inspiration for accumulating more positives into your own life, like considering trying out some of the hobbies she has, for example.

"The checklist my DBT manual uses:
1. Does my emotion fit the situation? Or did an old past emotion get triggered in me? If it's the latter, use opposite action.
2. Is my emotion so strong that I can't think clearly anymore? -> If so, opposite action.
3. Would most people feel this way? Would people I admire feel this way? -> If no, opposite action.

"Exactly this. When deciding *whether to act* on something, the emotion behind the urge can matter less than the urge itself.

Yes, the emotion is important, and imo emotions are *valid* in the sense that they... come from somewhere or something. On some level, they make sense. They happen, likely, for a series of reasons. 

And that makes them relevant to the urges we have, and worthy of acknowledgement; it's important to understand them when we can... but the urge alone, ie what the emotion tells you to do, determines whether acting on the urge is productive. The emotion behind it can make all the sense in the world and it does deserve validation, or at least acknowledgement, but that doesn't mean any urge is innately reasonable to act on.

If your emotion urge is to tear her down or be passive aggressive, act opposite.

If you want to lurk her social media so you can find evidence supporting the idea that she has stuff you should also have, or if you want to upset yourself/increase the emotion by keeping tabs on her and all the things you don't have, act opposite.

If you want to talk shit or claim she doesn't deserve it or blah blah blah, act opposite.

I second the above commenter's suggestion of the 'values and priorities' exercise, too. What's more important to you— the relationship? Your friend's feelings? Protecting your own feelings? Your integrity? Etc. Can't remember off the top of my head exactly how that exercise goes.

I’ve recently been experiencing some hair thinning and it has taken a tremendous toll on my mental health. Im thinking of it night and day and am constantly researching about it.

"Aw I feel you, this is such a hard thing to go though!!!  

Radical acceptance and unpacking those cultural/familial values about aging and hair (or lack of hair) and deciding what your values are surrounding appearances and ""beauty"" might help put some distance between those reactive or judgemental thoughts and your actual worth.

"In July of 2020 I did 8 weeks of DBT through an IOP program. It was virtual, 3 hours a day, 5 days a week. I found it helpful... but I don't know if when the 8 weeks were up I had ""internalized"" the skills as much as I had ""studied"" them if that makes sense. I participated in a weekly group once I finished the IOP but it fizzled out and I hadn't found any other support groups that fit my schedule. I've still been seeing a therapist weekly, though, and taking my meds.

Today my therapist suggested that I do another round of IOP as a ""refresher"". She said it's totally normal and some people repeat it several times. I admit I am seeing needing to do IOP as a sign of failure, and I need to reframe that thinking...

If anyone has repeated IOP or gone back for a refresher, could you share your experiences?"	JBLBEBthree	post	32.24968809718678	female	White	0.08393313735723495	na	na	na	19	dbtselfhelp

"I’m starting IOP for the fourth time this week. And here’s how I’d describe my situation each time I went:

1.	April 2019 — life in absolute shAMBLES, mental health on the brink, was calling everywhere in town (fortunately I’m in a city with options) because I just *needed help*
2.	October 2019 - had developed some bad habits that were hard to break without support due to extreme stress and lack of routines at my job during the summer. Primarily looking for high-level accountability and peer support. 
3.	April 2020 - COVID happened and I was struggling. I didn’t know it yet, but I had actually developed long-COVID which was effecting my body and mind extremely negatively
4.	October 2022 - Just got back to my city after a very ill-fated year away. I ended up not really having access to any mental or physical healthcare while I was gone and that was Bad. I’m now trying to get back on track as I have some really stressful stuff coming up in November/December. 

The way I see it, IOP is just another tool. Sometimes it can even be preventive if I feel myself slipping and don’t want it to get really bad. None of my subsequent visits have been as intense or revelatory as the first one, but each one has been helpful. 

If you think it would help, I’d encourage you to look into returning. Of course I’m biased, but I think going back doesn’t reflect a failure at all! It sounds like you’re really trying to take control of your mental health and seek out the resources you need through going to a support group, continuing standard outpatient therapy, working with a prescriber, and now posting on this forum to learn more about repeat visits to IOP. That’s a super admirable and mature thing to do and if you choose to return to IOP I’d say that’s just more of the same.

"Hey everyone — I was in bed doing my usual pre bedtime thinking and came to kind of a stark and harsh realization, I really do not enjoy being present about 80-95% of the time. 

I know dealing with this issue entails a bunch of different aspects of DBT training, I keep thinking back to mindfulness and willingness. 

My biggest issue during this realization is I’ve spent a tremendous amount of my life (from pretty young) not present — anywhere from maladaptive daydreaming, to just plain disassociation; I’ve managed to use this as a (harmful) coping mechanism for a great majority of my life, recently allowing myself to isolate almost completely from friends, family and close relationships. 

I’m wondering if there are any tips out there for practicing both willingness and mindfulness in a situation similar to this — almost disliking and having great discomfort in simply “being” and existing within the present moment, especially when dealing and spending time with others"		post	47.824528054414785	female	White	0.4722591042518616	na	na	na	7	dbtselfhelp

Pick one thing, for me it was shopping.

I started coming along but being in the car. Practice actively being mindful and in the moment.

Next for me was going inside. The noise was too much so headphones with music/podcast so I could get used to being around so many people. Then just noise cancelation so everything was less loud, then no headphones, but I had them with me.

Then it's being in charge of the list, finding the route to get the items, checking them off.

I had to start small and with something simple so I could get used to it?

"I have totally experienced this, and spent a lot of the first part of my time with DBT working on it. What has helped:
-How skills, especially Participate. I had to learn to enjoy the sensory experience of parts of my life- the warm water when washing dishes, sunshine on a bus ride, the feeling of my blankets, etc. This obviously involves Mindfulness. 
-Accumulating positive experiences: choosing to do things that are sensorily pleasing- clothing, cutlery, media, locations, people, activities that I like, and then then tuning into why its pleasant. Remember what's pleasant even when I'm not there. 
-a dynamic balance btw acceptance and change: some parts of my life, I had to change for life to be worth living. For example, I got super disassociated at the grocery store and it would wreck my mindfulness for the day. I need to order grocery pick up instead of shop even though it's more expensive, bc it's not worth it for me to experience something I hate so much.

"Some skills that come to mind for me:

Participate (part of the ""what"" mindfulness skill): throw yourself into an activity completely. It's okay to do something that's quick and easy. For me, taking the bins out is an example. It takes less than 5 mins. It doesn't have to be long and drawn out, but have a go at fully throwing yourself into something.

Building mastery: planning an activity that will give yourself a sense of accomplishment and then doing it. It's about adjusting the difficulty level so that you're appropriately challenged and engaged, but not overwhelmed, and slowly increasing difficulty over time. It helps with feeling competent, which can build up a sense of resilience and being able to handle reality. 

Accumulate (positive events): try and have one positive event every day. The handouts have a great list of hundreds of ideas. It can be something simple like just looking at the sky and admiring the beauty of it. Try and be mindful of the positive event.

Self soothing: use all 5 senses to ground in the present moment. Eat a throat sweet, hum a tune, look at a nice picture, touch a soft blanket, smell a nice smelling thing. Integrating all your senses can help being present be a little more comfortable.

IMPROVE (imagery, meaning, prayer, relaxation, one thing in the moment, vacation, encouragement). If being present is distressing, is there one thing you can do to make the moment a little easier?

Practising dialectics in everyday life: reality is full of contradictions, and it can be uncomfortable. Practising observing dialectics can help with letting go and going with the flow. The main points are looking at things from both sides/ different perspectives, embracing change and accepting disagreement, being aware of how all things are connected, noticing how things have an effect on you and vice versa.

Practising radical acceptance of each present moment: observe that you are fighting reality, noticing what feels unpleasant or unacceptable, accepting with mind body and spirit, allow disappointment or sadness, etc.

Some other things:

Be gentle with yourself. Being present can be difficult. Many people spend a lot of their life checked out from reality. Whatever you can manage is a good enough place to start, even if that's only 5 mins a day. Hopefully soon it will be 10 mins, then 30 mins, then an hour, etc.

Consider asking yourself what it is about beong present that you find difficult. Is it thoughts? Is it emotions? Is it some material circumstance on your life that is problematic? I know I often check out because I'm trying to avoid feeling an emotion. in the past I've also checked out because there were problems in my life that felt overwhelming.

If you have something specific to work with, that gives you more options. Maybe it's practising emotion regulation skills to become more okay with feeling emotions. maybe it's using problem solving to address a situation that you can change. Maybe it's practising mindfulness of thoughts to make your mind feel more of an okay place to be aware of. Maybe it's working on PLEASE skills to take good care of your body so that when you are present, it feels a little bit better. Lots of options.

Edit: I realise that a lot of these suggestions are not really about spending time with other people. I would hope that practising these things when you're on your own could help gradually build up that connection with being present in a general sense, and hopefully would support you in being more present with others as well"		reply	na	na	na	0.4722591042518616	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

I ended up in a workshop called ""Wellness and Resillience"" at their suggestion. I was aware that it was DBT, but didn't know what that meant besides 'life skills'. Once I was there and learned some of the strategies for coping with negative emotions and promoting positivity, I realized it was what I needed.

"You don’t ever know for certain. You make a best guess of next direction, move forward, obtain data based on what happens In response to your move, evaluate that data and then make your next move. Repeat, forever and forever. 

You have paid for and obtained advice from a mental health  professional.  You must evaluate that advice yourself. 

What is the risk? (Maybe It won’t work but is unlikely to harm ) 

What is cost? (Maybe be high cost but may be with it) 

What could go right? (Maybe life changing and get me out of my rut more quickly and cheaply then long term psychodamic psychotherapy, plus with less risk of ED, or addiction/withdrawal than meds)

To me, seems an easy choice to go. However I don’t know your financial situation and the other best options for the time and money. 

I’d suggest, based on my limited life experience, that trying out several of the best therapies (ie CBT, DBT among others) is a good investment of resources. Maybe if they don’t work also try meds and or psychodynamic psychotherapy. 

Or start a non profit that offers horse rides to disabled kids. Seriously, some people really would do better for themselves just by focusing more on doing good for others . Introspection great in moderate doses, too much can be bad for your mental health.

At the same time, without DBT I would never have learned how to tolerate distressing or ""uncomfortable"" situations or feelings. DBT helped me to tame my fight or flight response which was overactive to begin with.

"My previous therapist, who had more of an eclectic approach, mentioned a few DBT practices when providing referrals and said that she thought I responded well to DBT (as in, I responded well when she used or taught me DBT skills). She said I had traits of BPD (I’m now diagnosed with BPD), and DBT is the gold standard for that, so it also made sense to me in that context.

I railed against it and was very willful at first, not wanting to focus as much on the skills and calling it too “cult-like” and wanting to just have “heart to hearts” all the time and being afraid of phone coaching exacerbating my attachment, to name a few hesitations. There weren’t many therapist options at the time, however, and the individual therapist I was matched with was really warm, which I liked, so I decided to give DBT and my therapist the benefit of the doubt and take some chances and try letting down some of my walls.

I’m retrospect, I think my high emotion dysregulation, instability in my sense of self, and really intense obsessive attachments to figures in my life were the things that were causing me the most distress, and DBT targets those, so I think that’s why it was (and is) a good fit for me.

"My DBT workbook lists ""You Don't Know What You Want"" as a factor getting in the way of Interpersonal Effectiveness, but doesn't really give any advice as far as clarifying that for yourself.

It says: 

• You have the skills, but can't decide what you really want from the other person  
• You can't figure out how to balance your needs versus the other person's needs: asking for too much vs. not asking for anything; saying no to everything versus giving in to everything

In my case, I've gone on a few dates with someone I really like, but we both want to take things slow. Problem is, I don't know specifically what that means for me, as I've always just defaulted to previous partners' whims and convinced myself I was fine with it (in retrospect, I was not).

"This is an area of DBT that dovetails beautifully into ACT (Acceptance Commitment Therapy). If I'm unsure about what I want, in relationships or any aspect of life really, I try to ask myself how this person/thing/activity/choice aligns with my core values and the things I _do_ know I want. If things feel okay, I talk about those values and experiences I want from life and see how the other person overlaps (not just romantic partners, to be clear, but friends, a new therapist, you name it).

If you aren't sure what these values and ideas are for you, there are also some worksheets involving this in DBT, though I think they're tied to accumulating positive experiences. I had a hard time with severe depersonalization when I first started DBT and as a result found it easier to reverse engineer them from moments or actions I've taken before. I strongly remember telling my therapist I didn't feel like I had values (because I was disconnected) and she asked me why I had purple hair. I told her it was to make my queerness visible towards others so I can communicate that I'm not a threat re: toxic masculinity and such. She smiled and said that response didn't sound like someone without values. That hit me hard and helped jumpstart this."	dr-bookshelf	reply	na	na	na	0.9961104989051819	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

Try looking at the Clarifying Goals (IE handout 4 - pg. 124, worksheet 3 - pg. 173). as well as the Pros and Cons worksheet (IE worksheet 1 - pg. 167) and the troubleshooting worksheet (IE worksheet 7 - pg. 178).

"As I've been working through the ""understanding what emotions do for you"" section of emotion regulation, something that helps me understand each emotion is to consider some important functions of that emotion. The handouts talk about how feeling emotions moves us to act, and how this can be helpful in life or death situations. 

Sometimes emotions fit the facts and sometimes they don't, sometimes the urges they cause are helpful and sometimes they're not. But either way, it helps me to think about the instances where they do fulfil important functions. For example, anger helps us respond to valid threats, guilt and shame help modify our behaviour to be accepted by others (we're social creatures and depend on each other), fear helps us respond to risk, etc. For most of the emotions in these handouts, I can think of some pretty essential human functions that they're involved in.

But I can't make sense of this with sadness. Why do we as humans have a capacity to feel sadness? What do we need it for? I'm curious as to whether anyone else has thought about this, and whether anyone has any insights they'd like to share.

I appreciate that this line of questioning goes beyond the scope of DBT. For me it's comforting to ask these questions as it helps me understand my emotions better."	gobz_in_a_trenchcoat	post	19.471987215672144	male	White	0.0013834374258294702	na	na	na	15	dbtselfhelp

"From an evolutionary standpoint, I believe sadness is a slow, more reasoned way for contemplation of ""something bad has happened or might happen and maybe we can learn from that."" We grieve our loved ones when they pass, and there is no solution to be had, other than, perhaps, taking care of each other while we're together. If we weren't sad when our family or pets died we'd be less inclined to treat them well or value their contributions to our lives. If we weren't sad when someone hurt our feelings or when we missed an opportunity we were excited about, then we might be ostracized or not feel motivated to go after the thing we want. Like pain or anger, sadness is a negative feedback that we need. More or less. Obviously we are sad about tons of things that don't really help us in any way.

Great replies in here already, I had a couple more personal explanations for sadness that haven’t been mentioned. For me, especially when I’m sad because I’ve lost something, sadness is an expression of love for what I once had, which ultimately makes me a bettered person with enriched experience. Also, the experience of sadness and no matter how long it takes, moving on from different it, is one of the greatest developers of maturity and is a key part of what nourishes our character and empathy for self and others. Basically, it can help you become a better person through expanding your gratitude and perspective. Thinking this way helps me not feel like everything is useless when I’m struggling with sadness, and helps me appreciate retrospectively periods of sadness.	gobz_in_a_trenchcoat	reply	na	na	na	0.0013834374258294702	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

I think that's what confuses me. The sadness response to death seems like a vastly different situation from ""I made this tool but it broke and now I have to start again"".

I live in the UK and just started DBT-Informed Skills Group. It’ll be 20 sessions, and I’m only on my 2nd. 

I struggle in groups and I was wondering if anyone can help me understand wise mind better. I’ve gotten myself in a right mess as I have issues processing and I’m getting confused but to anxious to ask the nurses (who don’t feel all that approachable). I also feel like the sessions can be vague…

I understand what it is; combination of emotion and reasonable mind, gut instinct etc… but I don’t understand how it helps. 

When would I use this skill?
How do I know something is coming from my wise mind?
When they mention asking your wise mind a question - how do I know the answer?

They gave mindfulness activities like the staircase, and a stone in the lake. But I don’t understand how it links to wise mind… I really don’t get this skill and finding it overwhelming researching it and trying to figure it out myself lol… any guidance would be great…

Now then, take stock of what your emotions want you to do. If you do that, you are living in EMOTION MIND.  


After that think about what someone who had no emotions and was only thinking based on the facts would do. That's LOGIC MIND.  


Now that you know the action outcome for both EMOTION MIND and LOGIC MIND it is time for WISE MIND. To make a decision in wise mind you do the most effective thing right now that aligns with your values, but do it in a way as to not invalidate your own emotions.

Practicing mindfullness is like being patient and waiting for your eyes to adjust (imagining you got better at seeing in the dark over time though lol). Through that skill I'm slowly better able to pick out the edges and shapes of things in the darkness, which becomes noticing what's there, which becomes making sense of the room.

Wise mind is a really hard skill to explain. For me, it feels like my intuition (which I’m sure you’ve heard a million times), a voice from inside me that knows what’s right. I grew up out of touch with my own instinct and boundaries, so accessing wise mind is super helpful for me when im confused about how I’m feeling or when I need to make a decision. I just steady myself take a deep breath and if im grounded enough I can almost hear/feel a calm inner voice guiding me. In my experience we usually know what’s good for us deep down, what feels right and what doesn’t, but that instinct gets blocked out.

"Idk if it's oversimplification of the concept, but it's kind of like pausing before acting and making the right choice.

The biggest example that I was able to do BEFORE DBT is answering an email. I find a lot of them make me super angry or emotional for whatever reason. Especially inter-office emails with someone in my department. If I just type back what I'm thinking and go with emotion mind, I'll have some nasty responses because that's my first instinct. If I let myself think on it and craft the perfect politician response, it'll be cold and calculating but genuinely cause fewer problems. 

I think wise mind is for the areas of life where it's not so easy to pause and think and you end up balancing emotional needs and intellectual needs. So like setting boundaries might be a good example of something that balances emotional needs and intellectual ones. If you don't tap into your emotions at all you're going to not know what is causing you stress, so you need to approach things from both angles."

"Mindfulness isn't really meant to ""DO"" anything. It's just being aware. Aware of your emotions, your body, your surroundings, everything you can be.

"Mindfulness just helps you be aware you CAN use a skill. That's all it does. The fact that you're stopping and thinking of using wise mind at all means you are practicing some mindfulness and it is helping! :D It doesn't matter if you SUCCESSFULLY use the skill, just that you thought about it at all is a huge step!   


As for wise mind it's there to help you not make decisions in emotion mind nor in logic mind. It's especially important when you are feeling big emotions. EMOTION mind can want us to do impulsive things that aren't always the ""smart"" thing to do. Likewise, LOGIC mind can sometimes have us act too 'cooly' and invalidate our own needs or emotions. Wise mind lets you walk the middle path and try and find a solution that gets your needs met, in an effective, non-destructive way.

">if anything I just sit there and think about how it’s not helping

what a mood. I think we've all felt that before. So fucking valid.   


Let's imagine a scenario. Imagine you're walking, you bought your favorite beverage, and oops, someone bumps into you spilling it all over your shirt. That sucks. If it was me I'd start feeling a lot of emotions well up. Anger, sadness, embarrassment. I may not be aware of which emotions are rising up, or that emotions are arising at all! If I were aware of my emotions though I'd be being mindful. Not of everything, but at least of my emotions. You're not going to be aware of everything everywhere all at once. That's impossible. But you can be mindful of what you're feeling, where you're feeling it, what the feelings make you want to do, ect. These are all bits of mindfulness.   


Let's imagine a reaction to that scenario in EMOTION, LOGIC, and WISE minds:  


In EMOTION mind you would be instinctual and only listen to the emotions. The anger would want you lash out and hit the person perhaps, push them, yell. The sadness would make you want to cry and have a lump in your throat. The embarrassment makes you want to hide and run away. If you make a decision based on one or many of these emotions then you are living in EMOTION MIND at that moment. You can see how all of those reactions are ineffective I hope? If not it's okay and we can talk that out!  


In LOGIC mind you would act like a robot almost. Nothing I can do about it, no use getting angry or upset about it. No use crying over spilt milk. As a result, all emotions about this are also invalid because there's no use is being sad or angry or embarrassed about an accident. I should be able to just soldier on! You can see how this is kind of invalidating of your emotions right? Your emotions are gonna be felt, that's unavoidable, invalidation is what makes it extra painful.   


in WISE mind though things are different. You understand EMOTION mind and what it wants you to do. You understand LOGIC mind and what it wants you to do. You now synthesize these two and come to WISE mind. So a solution could possibly be moving on but letting yourself feel those emotions without beating yourself up over it but also not lashing out at anyone. You respond effectively by maybe going to the bathroom and drying off, or changing clothes. It could even be using some interpersonal effectiveness DBT skills. The important thing it that you still allow yourself to feel those emotions. You do the smart thing AND allow your emotions to be felt. That's the synthesis of the two.   


These emotions are still fair game for other DBT skills to be used on. Emotion regulation and distress tolerance. And like I hinted at if the scenario calls for it you can use other interpersonal effectiveness skills too.   


How does this all relate to the difference of wise mind vs mindfulness though? I would say this, making a decision in wise mind requires you to be mindful of the situation and your emotions. You see how the mindfulness of both the logic and emotion minds ENABLES the wise mind? You can be mindful at any given second. When you are on autopilot driving along a straight stretch of highway and suddenly you snap out of it. That moment you snap out of it you are being mindful again. It's just being actively aware of SOMETHING. The situation, your emotions, the color of the sky, the shape of a cloud. I hope this is making sense.   


If you're still confused with the difference between wise mind and mindfulness let me know! OR confused about any other part, I'm still happy to help! :D"	AwkwardPotat0	reply	na	na	na	0.9991762042045593	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"They make instant ice packs that you squeeze or shake to activate and can get at most pharmacies. You could also carry an insulated water bottle with ice or a frozen water bottle wrapped in a towel.

I personally like to use an ice pack like you’d put in a school lunch box and wrap it in a washcloth and put it in a plastic bag and then put that down in my tote, purse, backpack, etc. That usually lasts several hours after I’ve left the house even in the heat. Sometimes I’ve put a drop of lavender essential oil on the washcloth. 

Another option is to use something like tiger balm or icy hot (usually used for soothing sore muscles), that gives a kind of cold or tingling sensation, and rub it on your wrists, temples, or wherever it’s most helpful. The smell in this case might also help. If you’ve never used those types of products before though, I’d try them out at home when you don’t need them first just to see how you feel about them.

You could also try sucking on really strong mints.

I think the emotions you are feeling are envy and shame, not jealousy. There are several skills I would use. First, observe the emotions you are feeling. You can practice Mindfulness of Current Emotions/Thoughts to ease emotional suffering. Act nonjudgmentally towards yourself, your life, and others’ lives. Practice Check the Facts to determine if the emotions you are feeling fit the facts of reality. If they do, try practicing Problem Solving. If they don’t or are not effective, try practicing Opposite Action. I would also try some Radical Acceptance, Willing Hands/Half-Smiling, and Willingness. Also, you can practice Loving Kindness to help with feelings of self-loathing and shame.	No-Employment-8438	reply	na	na	na	0.9983183145523071	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Besides all the ""do the work"" I think one random cognitive exercise that helps me a LOT is just being realistic. If you've picked a path and never change your mind or have any obstacles it's not that hard to graduate from college. You're comparing yourself to people with fewer obstacles or who never changed their mind. You also don't know what parental support and family pressure they face.

Other weird thing I do is try to be more selective in my social media and find people you can root for. My favorite people I follow are recovering addicts who post about their sobriety, travels, flipping weird objects on Facebook marketplace. I like people who post about their mental health struggles and gastric bypass journeys. Idk maybe 30 something is the year some people give up on the standard fakeness and just show vulnerability, but if you can find those people try to appreciate them. The pangs of jealousy I feel at certain people don't feel as bad if I can find myself rooting for others sometimes."	No-Employment-8438	reply	na	na	na	0.9983183145523071	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Changing your behavior with DBT isn't going to help emotional flatness.

Maybe try traditional talk therapy to address possible depression, anxiety, or trauma. Many medications also cause emotional flatness.

It's also okay to feel like that sometimes. It's normal and humans are emotionally diverse. Maybe you are bored or a little sad or lonely as a result of normal life events.

"Hi everyone! I really struggle with communicating assertively (I'm usually a passive/aggressive communicator). In an attempt to better my skills, I thought I'd share with y'all some of the interpersonal communication techniques I've been trying to rewire in my brain.

* Instead of ""sorry, it took me so long to deliver XYZ (b/c of my illness)"" → ""thank you for your patience""
* ""I was hospitalized for bipolar."" → ""I just found out I have a condition that was recently debilitating. However, I will be back to work in X days and once I have a break, I can still fulfill/carry on these X, Y, Q, and Z responsibilities.
* ""Is it OK that I take on less work?"" → ""I am going to take a mental health day tomorrow.  *Thank you for your understanding.""*
* Blaming others: ""Why'd you do this? You hurt me by doing X"" → ""I feel upset and betrayed when you did XYZ.""
* Overall, I've been learning to 1) stand my ground 2) be firm 3) take intentional pauses, waiting (silence is the secret behind good negotiation) 4) saying NO.
   * I was always feeling so guilty for saying ""no"" in my work and I was a ""yes, and"" kind of person. However, I'm working on saying NO more because it is NECESSARY for my health.
* Aggressive people: learn to be a nice pitbull, still a pitbull but a nice and gentle one.

Overall, the key in workplace communication (and any interpersonal communication) is providing **ACTIVE and CONSTANT communication.** I'm working on being more upfront about my timeline and care/treatment that I'm in, since I was recently hospitalized 3 times.

As someone who has bipolar, I've also learned to not just spontaneously send it during a high point, but just read a draft of my email multiple times and get feedback from a trusted mentor before sending it out.

"In the DBT Skills Training Manual and it seems helpful when it says stuff like  ""Acceptance is not approval, compassion, love, passivity, or against change.... Changing reality requires first accepting reality.... Etc."" But then it immediately walks it back with ""Remind yourself that there are causes for the reality. Acknowledge that some sort of history led 
up to this very moment. Consider how people’s lives have been shaped by a series of factors. 
Notice that given these causal factors and how history led up to this moment, this reality had to 
occur just this way (“This is how things happened”)... Practice accepting with the whole self (mind, body, and spirit). Be creative in finding ways 
to involve your whole self. Use accepting self-talk—but also consider using relaxation; 
mindfulness of your breath; half-smiling and willing hands while thinking about what feels 
unacceptable; prayer; going to a place that helps bring you to acceptance; or imagery.""

That seems only to be surface level lip service to accepting something as it is, so that what can actually be done can be done, then underlying fatalism and beyond tolerance, even 'half smiling willing hands' loving wrong, injustice, harm, etc.

I'm not sure if this would be helpful for you. But, for me it's helpful to remember that DBT skills aren't necessarily meant to teach me skills to fix injustice, but rather skills that keep me safe from being self-destructive. So, radical acceptance skills help me to keep myself as regulated as I can be when I experience or am exposed to an injustice. And from a more regulated state, I can decide how I am going to respond. But, I accept as well that disturbing experiences are disturbing. And it makes sense to be upset by injustice. But, with DBT skills and community, I can respond both to my upset and to the injustice in ways that still align with my goals and values.

"It's the first step towards distress tolerance-- that is, feeling distress and not trying to make it go away. Just let yourself be distressed, no matter how bad it feels.

In CBT, you are trying to change your emotions by changing your thoughts. But in DBT, you can't change your emotions when they are very intense. If you are suicidal, you are suicidal. You accept the suffering without pushing away from it.

It's like Buddhist monks who meditate while fasting. They accept the suffering and just keep meditating through the hunger pains.

I guess you can compare it to an animal caught in a trap. The more they fight, the worse they injure themselves. When they become calm and accept the pain and stop fighting, they reduce further damage to themselves. Eventually the trap (distressing situation) will open (or end) on its own.

I don't know if you read about secondary emotions. But radical acceptance is stopping secondary emotions. Being in a trap is primary emotion, fighting against the trap is second emotions. They double your suffering.

Emotions are temporary, and to learn distress tolerance, you have to accept that sometimes you will be distressed and there's nothing you can do but weather the storm until the intense emotions pass."	Balthactor	reply	na	na	na	0.9984683394432068	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

My DBT self help book suggests a an exercise of reading some news articles and not forming opinions or judgements for a bit. Try it out but it's super difficult.

"I think you can acknowledge causes without leaning into fatalism. An alternative to fatalism could be ""observing the complexity and vastness of history"". If you have a go at listing all the causes of an event, and go really deep, and try to get a sense for the weight of human history, it can be grounding in a way. I can see how the wording of the handout (""things had to happen this way"") could be confusing. I interpret it as a statement about how multiple causes work together to make something happen, and many of those causes are simply very powerful, and accepting that there was no intervention in those causes at that time meant that they were able to effect the event into existence.

Another thing about this skill that I've found through practice: it takes time. Like, a lot of time. I need to sit down with it and write things down for every step of the exercise, spend a good 20 minutes journalling about causes, my observations of reality and my fighting against it, etc. Then I physically lie down on the floor and do deep breathing while meditating on the reality. Maybe about 15 minutes into that, I might feel a wave of sadness and I might cry. The wave of sadness is usually an indication for me that the skill is working. But it is sloooooooowww."

Ooof I struggle so much with this. I don't understand how you can tolerate the emotion if you are in distress. It seems to contradict itself. In my head, if I'm in distress then I'm not tolerating the discomfort because I'm being made to feel discomfort and I don't want to feel it. The willing hands technique doesn't help either because at the end of the day, I'm just not willing to feel the pain and I don't get how I'm supposed to work around that."

There's 6 components (I just made 5 for simplicity):

1. Prompting Events: this is the trigger or it could be something positive, like a new accomplishment you have made that could make you uncomfortable because it's new
2. Interpretation of the event
3. Vulnerability Factors: similar to how if you're cold, you're more likely to be sick
4. **Biological change: this part kind of blew my mind.** Apparently, emotional responses triggers something in your brain (a chemical response) and we all feel it. So, emotions are all mental
5. Experience: this is how you feel the emotion with **5 senses**
6. Expression: how you e-mote, essentially. This is what actors learn how to fake really well

Additional, after the emotion is felt and expressed:

1. After-effects: The thought, the memory, ***how you process it***
2. Secondary emotions"	oceanair-fir	post	16.253264751383682	male	White	0.005961566232144833	na	na	na	7	dbtselfhelp

"Hello everyone — I recently ended an IOP DBT program in late July. I decided to stay in the program a few extra weeks due to the information being tremendously helpful and almost life changing. 

One thing I really struggled with throughout, and now after is Radical Acceptance. 

My issue isn’t being able to practice said skill, it’s my tendency to utilize it too often in situations where it probably isn’t necessary. 

For example, my favorite person wants to cease a friendship and relationship with me, so I (sadly) agree and accept the situation. That person then proceeds to explain that they’re upset that I didn’t “fight” for our interaction/relationship. I chose to shut myself off and deal with the end of a close relationship in the way I felt necessary. 

So my question is there anyway to differentiate between situations where radical acceptance is necessary and where it isn’t? Particularly in social and romantic situations."		post	20.090701922665666	female	White	0.00604550214484334	na	na	na	8	dbtselfhelp
Well, that's kind of manipulative of that person, you know? You did the right thing. You respected a boundary. If they regret setting the boundary, it's their responsibility to renegotiate in a non-accusatory way.		reply	na	na	na	0.00604550214484334	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Unfortunately, knowing when you choose to radically accept and when not to is a wise mind skill, which we can only hone with time. 

Remember that radically accepting does NOT mean you agree or you're conceding your beliefs. You're just accepting the reality/facts of the situation. 

I personally do two steps when I'm struggling to channel my wise mind when I make a decision (in this case, your decision would be whether to radically accept). First, I check the facts to make sure I'm not contorting the situation. Second, I make a pros and cons list, now knowing what the facts are. Making a pros/cons of radically accepting something versus not radically accepting it will (hopefully) organize your thoughts a little better so that it becomes easier to access your wise mind. 

Honestly, though, this doesn't sound unhealthy on your part, OP. You checked the facts, and the facts were that your person told you they didn't want to see you. Based on that information, you made a decision, and later they changed the facts on you. That means they lied. How were you supposed to make the wise mind decision if you didn't have the correct facts in front of you? And they *knew* you didn't have all the facts, and they didn't try to correct you. That doesn't sound like a supportive person to me. 

All in all, I'm saying that I don't think your issue here was that you accepted the wrong thing--I think it's that you were unable to make the decision that (perhaps both you and them) wanted because they omitted information from you (i.e. lied to you)."		reply	na	na	na	0.00604550214484334	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I'm with you on radical acceptance. I get tripped up on when it's appropriate to use it, too. I feel it's probably the trickiest skill. 

I think it's likely best used for situations you are absolutely certain you can't change, like being sick or getting injured, the death of a loved one, losing a job, getting a DUI, your favorite sports team losing an important match, etc. These are things that once they've happened, there's no going back for a do-over; the only path from that point is forward, and the first step towards that is accepting what you cannot change. This is especially true if your situation leads to constantly ruminating and should-ing yourself or others. 

In the case of your favorite person, while we're limited in knowledge of how the conversation went, it sounds like there may have been a door they were leaving open. If you didn't want this relationship to end, maybe a better skill to use long before radical acceptance would be DEAR MAN to convince them not to end the relationship. If it gets to a point where they won't budge, they cut you off, you go months without contact, and it's become exceedingly clear they've made up their mind, that's when radical acceptance could be practiced.

I don't think any of us are ever expected to just accept every negative situation that comes our way. Many negative situations can be changed and we'll only be able to find that out if we try."		reply	na	na	na	0.00604550214484334	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
I’ve gotta agree with u/lulimay here. I mean I don’t know if I necessarily want to accuse them of being manipulative, but they were not being honest. You can’t expect yourself to mind-read. If someone tells you that they want to cease your relationship, you have to believe that and accept it. If it turns out that they weren’t being honest with you, that’s not a case of you using your skills inappropriately, it’s a case of them being dishonest. They might not have been dishonest on purpose - a lot of people just don’t have that self-awareness to realize what they truly want - but you can’t put the blame for that miscommunication on yourself. You used Radical Acceptance appropriately here.		reply	na	na	na	0.00604550214484334	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"So, there's a small pet peeve I have about the DBT workbook and instructor book around radical acceptance, which is that it's so easy to make the mistake of expecting this to be a skill you can actively use and practice as much as you can fill out a DEAR MAN to work on how you're going to talk to your boss.

Radical acceptance, in my own experience, is the last skill that you become accustomed to, and is super powerful. However, I also see it as one of the more passive. For example, when concerned about an issue, I still tend to go through the flow of:

- do I know what is going on? If not, use chain analysis to figure out what led up to this, what happened, and what became of it

- if I know, time to identify the emotional response I'm experiencing (Emotional Regulation's first skill)

- next it's time to check the facts. Is my emotional response a reasonable response, or is it disproportionate to the circumstance? 

- problem solve, or use opposite action to either embrace the emotion and improve the situation, or to change your attitude and actions as best you can

Pause here. Opposite Action? In my opinion, this is an extension of Radical Acceptance. As I practice opposite action and can identify the gap between my response vs how I react and the actions I can take to engage with, I can start to recognize and get comfortable with the idea of dialectics (something being more complex than yes/no, often with both sides occuring at once without contradiction).

- if I can't problem solve and Opposite Action isn't enough, time to use Distress Tolerance skills instead of Emotional Regulation. In my opinion, a lot of the times picking the distress tolerance skill to use is one of the most personal and individual choices in all of DBT. Your toolkit for distress tolerance can always grow, but you know it in best!

- if you have trouble with opposite action and tolerating the situation, I advocate for Turn the Mind in combination with the action you're trying to take (whether it be constructive or to just help get through this). 

Pause again. Turn the Mind is the skill of repeatedly redirecting your attention and thoughts to a specific subject of focus. It goes hand in hand with ""One Mindedness"" or whatever that buzzword in the Mindfulness module is, where you are working on being full present in what you're doing, as a form of active mindfulness.

In my opinion, this is also a skill that is tightly related to Radical Acceptance. In the light of an interruption, you're not so much pushing away the interruption or pretending to ignore it completely, as you are acknowledging that the distress or distraction is present, but you're going to give the current action your attention. 

To me, after many years since my first cycle through DBT, these are the building blocks that have lead to me truly radically accepting difficult situations or conditions. But, as a result of engaging with radical acceptance in this type of an active, practical way, I don't tend to ask if I need to use it in the moment, and if it is a healthy option. Instead, I am led to radical acceptance **through** the skills I use in the moment.

Hope that gives something to reflect on. I know it can be really obnoxious to muddle through, but it's absolutely worth it, and you've got this."		reply	na	na	na	0.00604550214484334	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"One thing that helps me to find the line with when to use radical acceptance is whether something has happened, or is happening or might happen. If something is in the past we must radically accept it. It's happened, nothing we can change. If something is happening or may happen in the future, we don't have to radically accept any of it, and can work to change what we can.

The example with your friend is a strange one, because it feels like you did the right thing to me. It's (at best) odd behaviour from them to try to end a relationship then be annoyed that you didn't try to stop it ending. I wouldn't take this situation as a indication of how good or bad you are at using skills."		reply	na	na	na	0.00604550214484334	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"It’s actually possible that radical acceptance is helping you navigate a manipulative person here *or* you may be misinterpreting radical acceptance a little bit. Radical acceptance is not reality about choosing how to proceed in an interpersonal conflict - it’s more about seeing an accepting a situation as it is - realistically appraising what is really happening and not turning away from the reality. 

If the person made it clear to you that they wanted to end the relationship, you might try radically accepting that they want to end the relationship. That doesn’t stop you from communicating to them that you don’t want to end it. However, if the person wants you to lose your shit and go crazy over them, and radical acceptance is allowing you to stay grounded and calm… well, that person isn’t being very kind to you as (I’m assuming since this is DBT) a person who struggles with emotional regulation. However, if radical acceptance is keeping you from telling them how you really feel (i.e. not wanting to end the relationship and why) then you may be actually not being effective and the skill isn’t intended to make you less effective. 

Radical acceptance is not resignation - it’s more a way to stop being willful in the face of the truth. 

It seems like if the relationship was not really over, you needed interpersonal effectiveness skills in addition to radical acceptance though!

"Acceptance doesn't mean agreement or approval. Acceptance also doesn't only mean acceptance of other people. You can accept something that you think is horrible is happening without going along with it. You have to accept yourself as well.

In your example where your friend wanted to pull away, acceptance of that only meant *accepting that they expressed that to you.* In the next step after that, you were not practicing reality acceptance, because you denied your own feelings, needs and desires, which are important parts of reality too. If you deny your feelings, you can't share them with others(e.g. telling your friend you want them to stay) or regulate how they affect you(e.g. navigating the grief of losing them.)"		reply	na	na	na	0.00604550214484334	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Honestly, I'm a huge, huge proponent of doing DBT with a professional. Please keep in mind that a complete DBT program has two components: individual therapy with a DBT practitioner AND group therapy led by a DBT practitioner. 

If you can find a program that has sliding scale/financial aid, that's huge. I was part of a financial aid program and paid $17/week for my group therapy. I didn't take advantage of their individual therapy but with my income level, therapy would have been $42/week. Compared to their full costs ($125 for group, $250-325 for individual depending on your therapist's qualifications), their financial aid program was a lifesaver. Keep in mind insurance wasn't involved at all because I didn't have any at that time. So therapy can be quite cheap if you can find the correct resources. 

In terms of protocols, DBT is very protocol-based. I filled put my diary cards 3x a day. I learned a new skill once a week and practiced it with worksheets throughout the week until the next lesson. My personal program was 24 weeks, but I've seen ones as short as 16. 

If you've studied clinical psychology, you know you should not be the one in charge of her treatment program. There's a conflict of interest and you know you don't have the distance to be able to treat her with objectivity. 

I'm not trying to be a downer; I just want to make very clear that part of DBT's proven efficacy is the amount of hand-on work *clinicians* need to do during treatment. I'm all for trying to do the worksheets together, but you should do it know that it unfortunately won't be as effective as going into a DBT program. As a matter of fact, if you can get a CBT therapist first as a placeholder, honestly that will probably be more effective than trying to enact a DBT program by yourself with absolutely no knowledge on the topic."

For building a life worth living, you could focus on the “accumulating positives” section, both in the short term and long term (living in line with values). 

Also, identifying where feelings are coming from and why can help guide you towards actions you can take you improve your life (if the emotion is justified, i.e. it fits the facts). For example if you are envious of someone’s clothes you could try to find or make similar clothes. If you’re angry at someone violating your privacy, you can set firmer boundaries with that person (dearman) and/or distance yourself from that person.

"I'll be honest, in my experience living with chronic anxiety and pain, while distress tolerance is incredible important, the real skill that helps me the most is PLEASE from emotional regulation. That is:

- PL: Treat physical illness
- E: Balanced Eating
- A: avoid mood altering substances
- S: balanced sleep and sleep hygiene
- E: exercise daily, graded (as in adjusted, not as in scored) to your body and needs

Stress can play a positive role in your life as long as it's not too severe, and you're balanced and capable of dealing with it physically without disrupting your daily needs and practices. Just as DBT says that ""every emotion has a message"", low level, managed stress can often be a response to direct energy to the actions that need to be taken in the moment, even though in another dialectic, too much stress can cause you to freeze and take no action.

I also love the ABC skill that is tacked in front of PLEASE often:
- Accumulate Positive Experiences
- Build Mastery 
- Cope Ahead (I actually shift this over mentally to Distress Tolerance instead of putting it here)

It's notable that it is accumulate positive **experiences** and not **emotions**. There's a very ""Live Laugh Love"" quote that I actually like that says ""Joy is Practiced"", and that to me doesn't mean we choose to be joyful when we aren't, but that we continue to do the things that have sparked joy before, knowing that we have to do them for them to ever spark joy again. That's what the A in ABC is about.

"I got a DBT workbook about a year and a half ago, and I think it changed my life. My main behavioral problem was self harm, but I also had some less severe issues with anger management. I learned REST and some distress tolerance skills, and it was shockingly easy to stop engaging in all my destructive behavior almost immediately.

The problem is that I can’t get anything done at work. I have all these healthy coping skills, but they only work when I’m actively engaging them. On bad days, I feel a difficult emotion, I successfully use a coping skill, and I start working again - and immediately I’m overwhelmed by panic about work and have to do it again. I never get to a place of actually being able to work. I used to act on my impulses sometimes. Now I don’t. But it hasn’t helped me perform any better.

As soon as the work day is over, I feel wonderful. Almost constantly. But when I’m at work, I have constant panic attacks. Not just about work, but about everything - especially relationships.

Does this get better? Does this mean that I’ve mastered Distress Tolerance but I’m not getting the Emotion Regulation part? Does that stuff really work? The distress tolerance was so easy, and the emotion regulation section just doesn’t seem to be going anywhere. Do I ever stop feeling constantly terrified? Is there a way to get myself to be productive through the panic? Is this better approached with something other than DBT?

Thank you for reading."	sadnessthrowaway62	post	24.521855465206794	male	White	0.9945144653320312	na	na	na	18	dbtselfhelp
"For me, I had to do a LOT of emotion regulation work-- like, years-- before it sunk in enough that I could take curveballs at work and be unruffled. Now I'm pretty sure I have the reputation among my coworkers as being able to deal with anything while being cool as a cucumber, and it's not just a facade because I'm really not freaked out at all. Distress tolerance always felt really straightforward to me but ER was definitely not. 

When I found myself having big executive dysfunction at work like what you're describing, it was really about something else I was upset about, often an emotion myth I had or (outside of DBT) shenpa, or ""scratching the itch"" as Pemma Chodron says-- basically obsessive rumination on my feelings. It was also highly tied to my trauma, which may or may not be the case for you. Even after I did my intensive DBT program, I struggled to function at work and I would often go into avoidance loops over triggers. It took a good two or three years of practice to REALLY settle in with my DBT skills and reshape my thought and behavior patterns fully. But like I said, now I may face annoyances at work and I may have an occasional moment where I consciously step away to self soothe, but work really doesn't stress me out or disturb my inner peace a whole lot. 

That's just one person's story but at least it shows you that you're not alone. This shit is HARD and work is extra hard.

"Okay, this feels extremely familiar to me. Thank you so much for writing this. There is so much in your comment that I have never heard of that seems potentially really valuable. 

I have never heard of shenpa, but “an unwillingness of human beings to let go of certain thoughts, particularly those that cause us suffering” feels right. Obsessive rumination is definitely correct. I guess I probably could have identified that myself and included it in my post. There is definitely a primary focus of my stress outside of work, it’s just that I feel so capable of handling it when I’m not working. Also I’m a little in denial about the source of my distress sometimes.

Wow, what you’re describing just feels so much like me. I’ve never heard the term “avoidance loops” but it feels like I might be doing that. Is there any way you could maybe say more about what that is, or is there something I could read about it? Is this something you worked with a therapist/clinician on? I have a therapist who I like, and I feel a lot more comfortable with her than I have with any other therapist, but I feel like I’ve never gotten these kind of insights from a therapist. I’ve never felt like I was doing therapy right.

Actually, to be honest, the main thing I’m fixated on that is causing me distress constantly is my diagnosis (my ex (romantic partner) diagnosed me with a new disorder and I really don’t want to have that one) and I’m currently desperately exploring any avenue I can find to try to get someone to actually give me a real assessment for mental illness rather than a 10 minute screener for MDD and GAD through my GP, but no one will call me back and I really don’t know what to do. So I really want to find a path with a therapist where I could actually understand myself but I just don’t know how. The closest I’ve gotten is self-guided DBT, which has been 100x better than anything else I’ve ever tried. I’m sorry, that just became a total rant.

It’s good to hear that maybe emotional regulation is a longer path than distress tolerance. Actually, it is a little distressing to hear because I don’t really want it to take years, but also it is reassuring that it doesn’t mean I’m doing it wrong. It kind of makes sense that it would take longer. But I feel like no one has ever told me that that’s normal. They should put that in the book.

"I’ve thought about it! Extensively! The trouble is that I think this job is about as low-stress as it gets in my field (architecture). I only work 32 hours/week! A more typical architect’s schedule is 50+. I’ve thought about leaving the field but I don’t know what I could do instead.

Plus I guess it was kind of my dream or whatever  at one time and I wish I could succeed instead of quitting.

My ex left his field (engineering) because it was too high-stress, and now he works in food service. Spoiler warning: it is not actually lower stress. My sibling left their field (social work) because it was too high-stress. Their new job is actually low-stress but they make so little that they have to live with my parents, which is a very high-stress environment for me.

Work relationships are definitely a big factor - mostly management more than peers, and I have tried a little bit to use Interpersonal Effectiveness strategies (and also just general assertiveness practice) toward improving the support I’m getting and reducing my stress in that way. But actually when I said relationships in this post, I meant personal relationships totally unrelated to work. It’s just that when I get into an anxious mindset about work, it spreads to non-work-related things, and suddenly all of my personal relationships (platonic, familial, romantic) seem deeply flawed and I get into a spiral about that.	sadnessthrowaway62	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9945144653320312	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"I'm so glad to hear shenpa resonates with you! Pemma Chodron had an audio book called ""getting unstuck"" that talks about it--it's a recording of a live session so ther d no print book. If you want a print book, I believe she has one called ""when things fall apart"" or something similar. My library always has tons of copies of her stuff so you may be able to source them for free. To bring this back around to DBT, I feel like her perspective really builds radical acceptance and mindfulness, and I found it helped me execute on my DBT skills better.

I thought about it a little bit but I think ""avoidance loops"" is an itsacoup special, unfortunately. I get stuck in them when my baseline SUDS (subjective units of distress) are too high. So if you haven't heard of SUDS, it's a 1-10 scale of how distressed you are, where 1 is perfectly zen and 10 is the most distressed you've ever been in your life-- for me that's panic attacks where I'm vomiting, but the scale is different for everyone. The key is just being honest about what the worst truly is. With your SUDS scale established, you should be executing on DBT skills according to it. So you can only be effective at interpersonal in the 1-3 range. Once you tip over into 4-6, you're in emotion regulation territory, and IE skills are going to be beyond you. Then in 7-10, you're in distress tolerance, and forget the rest until you're back down a bit. So with this in mind, I found I was having lots of avoidance loops when I was in the 4-6 range, regardless of the source of my distress. So for me I had to learn how to get really good at ER skills and effectively self soothing to bring down my distress, which usually would be enough to break the loop.

Re: therapy, there's no way to do it ""right"", it's just what works for you. If your clinician is not able to provide insights, they may practice the wrong modality to support you. Are they a DBT therapist? Do they practice any other modalities? It's a tough balance to find a therapeutic relationship where you're able to have the right kind of trust and connection AND they have the correct training to help you. I did DBT bc of PTSD/MDD/GAD so I've been lucky to have therapists that are highly trauma competent, so I not only use DBT but also IFS and EMDR and ACT as part of my regular practice. Therapists who don't use these modalities wouldn't be able to help me make progress. So there's no wrong way to do it, but there are non-optimal conditions for helping you make progress.

Okay, this is a check the facts situation to me. Is your ex a clinician? Are they certified or trained in any way to diagnose? Did they provide this ""diagnosis"" with the intent to manipulate or undermine you? Did they exhibit other behavior that crossed boundaries? Was the ""diagnosis"" a personality disorder? Even if the answer to the first two are ""yes,"" they're crossing significant ethical boundaries by diagnosing a non-patient that also is a partner/relation, and it's therefore inherently suspect. If the answer to the next three are ""yes,"" that means the ""diagnosis"" is not credible at all, given that it was likely a tool to use against you. The bar for personality disorders is VERY high, but the layperson jumps straight to them because they have zero training or sense of scope and it's a much more useful weapon so say you're ""inherently bad"" (not my view on PDs btw, just the societal prejudice).

Check the facts complete, if you still feel the need to get a formal diagnosis, is there a way you can leverage your current therapist? They may be aware of clinicians with less of a waiting list or may have direct relationships that can help increase your priority on their lists. Otherwise, unfortunately, the mental health systems seems to be so overloaded everywhere that it's just a slog. My wife spent most of the summer calling a couple dozen people to find a new therapist (going from gestalt, which was VERY unhelpful for a trauma background, to DBT/IFS) and only finally got into a first appointment a few weeks ago. But the other question is, if you got a formal diagnosis, would you trust it? Or would you still ""scratch the itch"" of what your ex told you? That is, is the diagnosis actually the solution, or is the work around why that ""diagnosis"" was so distressing the solution?

One of the hardest parts of my personal journey was accepting that I would be doing The Work until the day I die. I wanted to do an intensive DBT/trauma program and be ""normal"" and ""healed"" coming out of it, and I fought and kicked and screamed that I'd have to be doing this forever. But the reality is, the work changes. The hardest that ER will ever be for you is right now, as long as you continue practicing. It took several years for me to get to a point of what I feel comfortable as calling real and true mastery, but that doesn't mean I was as easily dysregulated on day six hundred as day one. I can tell you there were MANY points along the way to today where I told my therapist about using a skill and I was astounded and proud because it worked!!! I did it!!!!! And that matters just as much as reaching mastery, because it gave me hope and proved to me that what I was doing was working. And slowly over time, I became even better at using the skills, I caught situations earlier and used skills before they devolved into something worse, and now it's almost entirely unconscious mastery of skills unless I'm having a REALLY bad day.

">I see a long comment and raise the ante!

lol. :) I think we might be kindred spirits. I really appreciate your time so much.

Also I’d never heard of Pema Chodron before your comment, but yesterday my mood tracking app had a quote from her! 

So, with regard to the diagnosis thing - you guessed it, it’s a personality disorder. And yes, it was a highly problematic situation. Technically he never told me that I have BPD, because he is trained as a psychologist (has a masters, was pursuing a PhD & licensure but changed paths) so he knows that if he really tried to diagnose me it would only undermine him because it’s so obviously unethical. But he said “I’m surprised you’ve never been evaluated for BPD.” And he definitely had recurring issues with his temper, which he definitely liked to blame on me, which made me completely dismiss the BPD thing as a manipulation tactic for a long time. But as I read more about it, months after our breakup, there’s enough there that I keep coming back to it. His motives were obviously suspect, but he might have come to the right conclusion anyway.

However, I also have a tendency to diagnose myself with a lot of mental illnesses, such as GAD, MDD, PMDD, SAD, ASD, OCD, ADHD, cPTSD, and most of the personality disorders. It’s just that BPD is the first one I’ve ever *not* wanted to be diagnosed with. So I’m not sure if BPD feels so accurate to me right now because of the facts, or because it feels like a punishment and I have a strong compulsion toward guilt. I have talked to my therapist about it and she says I might “have some borderline traits” but that she isn’t the right person to make that diagnosis.

>But the other question is, if you got a formal diagnosis, would you trust it? Or would you still ""scratch the itch"" of what your ex told you? That is, is the diagnosis actually the solution, or is the work around why that ""diagnosis"" was so distressing the solution?

So this is for sure the truth. I think it would probably be advantageous to me to really be assessed for BPD, and maybe for the other disorders on my list. But I have a feeling that it might not immediately eliminate the obsessive rumination. Would I keep “scratching the itch”? My guess is probably I would. I feel like it’s worth trying an assessment, and I’m really hoping that it might inform more relevant care going forward. But I think I need to figure out how to manage my rumination regardless, both because it seems like it’s going to be a loooong time before I can actually access relevant medical care, and because that probably won’t be an instant solution anyway.

I will absolutely check out Getting Unstuck. Actually, it looks like the audiobook is available on my library app! Audiobooks are actually my favorite, and maybe I will follow up with more of her work after that.

I can also re-commit myself to the ER portion of DBT, with the expectation that it works slower than the DT section. SUDS seems like a useful tool to have. It is really helpful to hear your perspective with practicing in the long-term. It definitely feels like most of the people discussing this on reddit are newer to the practice, which makes it harder to imagine long-term success.

"Just because he has a masters in psych doesn't mean he knows jack shit about diagnosis. If he's never had clinical hours or diagnostic experience under supervision, he's got no leg to stand on. Especially given that BPD is overwhelmingly a diagnosis given to ""difficult"" women and is a very common misdiagnosis in women for trauma, I would consider the whole thing deeply suspect. Add to that abusive tendencies of taking his anger out on you, and to me it forms a pretty picture as a way to undermine you and give him a convenient excuse to blame you for EVERYTHING without it being his fault bc you're foundationally broken!!!!! He's such a martyr for staying with someone with BPD!!!!!!!!!!! etc etc rolling my eyes forever

I have a lot of qualms with BPD as a diagnosis, especially if you have trauma in your background. Everything you've listed is a common misdiagnosis for trauma, so if you had an abusive or neglectful upbringing, I'd go with Occam's Razor here and start with the trauma as probably the root of it rather than a PD, which again is a nuclear option from a diagnostic standpoint. If clinicians regularly mix up these diagnoses, you can be sure as a layperson that it's even harder to identify the differences. A history of SH or fear of abandonment does not mean BPD is the only answer. And don't get me started on ""borderline traits"", that is such bullshit and reveals the clinical bias against BPD.

That's some good self reflection! The point of diagnosis should be to access the most helpful treatment, but too often we essentialize diagnoses as personality. I wonder if that's why the potential of the BPD label is so difficult to let go of for you, since it communicates that it's an core part of your personality and can never be healed. Which is why PD diagnoses should be an enormous deal, and other diagnoses should be thoroughly investigated before going the PD route. I struggled with my CPTSD diagnosis for some time after receiving it and it doesn't have nearly the ""reputation"" as BPD, so working on skills for rumination sounds like an excellent plan to me as you'll likely need them regardless of how this part of your journey turns out. 

Happy to help! My journey taught me that all we have is each other and I take that as a serious responsibility. Also FYI your reply didn't come into my inbox and I can't find it on the post, so I hope you get this!

"Hi all, 

I used to be in a DBT program and stayed for a bit over two years. It was honestly a life-changing experience and probably saved my life. 

Unfortunately, it was a program meant for young adults and I grew out of the age limit, and now have been out of group therapy for almost a year. Not having regular reinforcement of skills is definitely taking a toll and I'm now taking steps to get back into a group as an addition to my personal therapy, which has been a combination of CBT/DBT/psychodynamic therapy for the past 8 years. 

I just wanted to post here to see if anyone had feedback to my plans and just use it as a place to brainstorm together (much like normal DBT group lol). 

My current behavior/emotion I want to change is the overwhelming resentment I feel toward my boyfriend. My problem is that the resentment clouds my ability to use the skills effectively. For example, when I check the facts, I can come up with pages of mean things he's said about me. I am currently combatting this by identifying dialectics and trying to recognize that opposite sides can both be true, but I'm really struggling to internalize it. Does anyone have better strategies, or would anyone like to share how they got over a big emotion that gets triggered often? 

Tangentially related, I'm also really struggling to channel my wise mind in what is acceptable to radically accept or what I should problem solve. Does anyone have specific guidelines for this? (e.g. a list of questions we should ask ourselves)"	localmuffinwhore	post	34.10039880709428	female	White	0.01324471551924944	na	na	na	4	dbtselfhelp
Check the facts isn't a tool to force yourself to feel a certain way, it's a tool to check if you're having cognitive distortions underpinning your feelings. If using check the facts turned up a list of truly mean things another person said to you, that's an enormous issue and feeling resentment is an appropriate response if your partner hasn't made a concerted effort to repair. DBT is not a skill set to make you accept being treated poorly. Radical acceptance is not about accepting being treated poorly, it's about accepting that reality is exactly what it is and you can't chance the past or what got you to this moment, but you can change the future from a place of radical acceptance.	localmuffinwhore	reply	na	na	na	0.01324471551924944	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Definitely radical acceptance. He is who he is. And I always say the mantra ""they are doing the best they can with what they have."" For example, maybe your boyfriend has only been taught to say mean things as his form of communication. But maybe he is trying to be there for you. Which leads to the forgiveness. You accept what he did but you also understand what he did wasn't right. It's an entirely different ball game though if this is an abusive relationship which you'll have to be the judge of.

"I (24f) have ADHD & BPD.  I have been doing DBT for 18 months.  In some ways it has been very helpful - I understand my brain and that not everything is my fault all the time.

But when it comes to the stressful situations that i’ve ended up in therapy for, it’s like everything I have learned immediately filters out of my brain.  I can use Cope Ahead, and Build Mastery, and Accumulate Positive Experiences etc - because they require some forethought.

But when I’m in a situation where I start to feel anxious, upset, threatened, etc, I completely forget i’ve even got skills I could apply. 

How do you remember to use skills when your brain is flooded with distracting emotions?

"YUUUUUP this one is it !!! i am 24f, diagnosed bpd since like 18/19, adhd at 21/23… this was always one of my biggest struggles too, i technically knew the skills or whatever, but my emotions are too fast for my brain to catch them or stop myself… people say just “remove yourself” like how do you REMEMBER that you need to remove yourself from the situation though ?!?! i just wanna keep going !!! 

you have to like, IMMERSE yourself in this shit. Like listen to podcasts about BPD and DBT whenever you can (Back From The Borderline is my fav, i listen at work !!!!), listen to theses podcasts with people close to you, take short notes during the episodes and note the time of the ones that especially hit you so you can reference it later !!! read bpd and dbt books, exercise dbt skills throughout the day randomly, my bf and i have used like, spongebob episode plots as “conflicts” to make it a little more fun !! Since you are ADHD like me… SET ALARRRMSS. Color code the alarms based on like, physical self care daily things, meds. appointments, even set alarms to practice dbt or keep certain skills in mind !!!! What REALLLY helped me is getting a separate alarm app for my sleeping alarms vs my scheduling alarms. I only touch the scheduling one to add appointments or something, i used to have them all on one app and since i need like 55 alarms to wake up it just didnt work lmfao. Sorry i wrote a lot but i had this exact problem for YEARS and nothing actually helped me realize i am in those moments until i started immersing myself in dbt and bpd info ALL THE TIME. i really really really really recommend the podcast Back From the Borderline !!!!!! The Episode of Mental Illness Happy Hour with Jesse Finkelstein is amazing !! tbh i like that podcast a lot too !

I haven’t read what everyone else has said so forgive if this has been said, but take this from a former DBT counselor! Don’t forget to first use a distress tolerance skill like TIPP, before you try using emotion regulation skills like ABC PLEASE!! Very important for when you’re already in distress. Distress tolerance skills put out the fire, and emotion regulation skills prevents it from happening again or worsening.

It only really comes w time +effort. I initially started getting better at *applying* skills by practice, because in my last year of DBT I started standing up to my shitty ex more and then realized i needed to leave. That helped me get the interpersonal effectiveness stuff down... everything else, now, over a year after finishing DBT, is still becoming muscle memory/beginning to feel more natural.

The skill I use the most is STOP when I enter a situation that is stressful or emotional. When I notice my face heating up or my heart racing, it’s an indicator I’m being affected and need to STOP, take a moment, realize I’m becoming emotional or stressed and to take a step back and ground myself.	tillymint259	reply	na	na	na	0.9974574446678162	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I'm struggling with this a bit, too, but in a different way. Not so much ""remembering"" to use skills but figuring out what fits the situation and how I'm feeling. I get overwhelmed with all the skills I've learned and I'm realizing my ADHD is probably playing a role in this struggle. Getting overwhelmed trying to figure out how to manage my situation with certain skills often leads to a total breakdown of skills for me and beating myself up. I've also noticed I feel a sort of burnout with practicing skills and lose interest in practicing after being hyper focused for a while (there's that ADHD - I have a lot of trouble sticking with most anything). I'm aware of them and practicing seemingly nonstop but I think I might be holding myself to too high of expectations and over-thinking all of it, or trying to accomplish too much, too fast. 

Anyway, a lot of people mentioned the STOP skill and that's what I've landed on as my go-to in all situations. I figure if I can get that down, then I'll be able to calm down enough to figure out where to go from there. And as others have mentioned, it's extremely important to practice it all the time in any situation but especially when your emotional arousal isn't high. That should hopefully make it easier to apply it when you actually need to use it. 

Something else I did to help me was buy a DBT card deck to hold myself accountable in practicing skills but also give me structure. I bought the deck by Matthew McKay and Jeffrey C. Wood on Amazon. I've been pulling one card a day and trying to integrate whatever skill is on the card into my day. I'll still practice other skills but I feel like having the structure of basically being told what to focus on is helpful so that I'm not jumping around and getting myself overwhelmed. 

Another thing I bought is the Neurodivergent Friendly Workbook of DBT Skills by Sonny Jane Wise, also on Amazon. It's much less overwhelming than the 400+ page workbook, easy to navigate, colorful, and includes sections for sensory strategies and even affirmations for Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (it leaves out Interpersonal Effectiveness, though, which I think was a good choice for its purpose). It's very basic but the language that's used in it has helped me to feel seen! It uses language that I personally feel is easier to grasp and makes more sense in my ADHD brain. Really glad I bought it. 

Lastly, when I notice I'm using a skill throughout my day, even something ""small"" like noticing a judgment or distorted thought, I celebrate and notice the pride I feel!

I hope some of this could be helpful for you. DBT is hard work. I'm trying to remind myself that living in emotion mind is harder, though. Good luck!"	tillymint259	reply	na	na	na	0.9974574446678162	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"for me the biggest hurdle was taking that crucial moment between a stimulus/input and my reaction. This takes remembering your goals in that moment. 

lts one of those easier said than done things lol

The ""moment"" can be 30 seconds long, it can be a whole day, it can be any length. 

Its purpose is to allow a new or different response rather than your old reactions which were maladaptive and dont move you closer to your goals. Then of course via neuroplasticity etc it becomes easier. 

like others hère are saying, it needs to be practiced during calm times. during relatively simple moments like, your dog aggravâtes you barking too much, instead of getting pissed you use the calm but firm discipline method that you know is more effective anyway.

"Just chiming in that this is also my experience. 

I'm still mastering it but to learn the skills I cant go to a class once, I need to take notes on a video of the skills, then take small notes on different podcasts (I use DBT and me, Therapists in the wild, sometimes the skillful podcast. Ru also does cute short videos of the skills). If its still not sticking I look at explanations online or do exercises in the green DBT workbook.Then I take colourful notes (it needs to be colourful to keep my attention) , then as revision I can go back and highlight them. To motivate myself I got colourful second hand pens and a folder/binder. I've got skill cards, but they're a recent addition so still figuring them out. Also i bought colourful worksheets/skill summaries on etsy which I use more since I dont find them as boring. I started journaling daily and when i remembered to do skills that arent in my daily routine i give myself credit!  If i didnt use a skill i write down what i could have used or might have benefitted from. 

I haven't been officially diagnosed but my clinical psych suspected ADHD. I use the fabulous app and have a habit set of ""ask if theres a skill you need right now"". I'm still asking while calm mostly but I'm getting there! I recently had a situation where I was stressed and forget to use skills so once it passed I just did a distress tolerance skill anyway as a rehearsal, you could also try that.

Also u/tillymint259 if you are only remembering skills you schedule just keep doing your cope ahead and it might start sticking in your difficult times. But maybe also add self soothe, you can do it everyday and keep your items in a kit with some notes/worksheets on ither skills like pros and cons, stop, etc. This is a more rewarding skill and since you are already doing it daily it may be easier to remember when distressed, which could remind you about the worksheets/skill cards in there to use. Some people also make their phone background a skill they want to remember or make bracelets with letter beads spelling out a skill, like STOP."	tillymint259	reply	na	na	na	0.9974574446678162	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I have been “working on” mindfulness my whole life. When I was 13 and first diagnosed, they gave me tips and “tools” to help. Each therapist I’ve had over the years has helped me a little more each time. 

I’m WILDLY more mindful than I was at 13… but sometimes it still just doesn’t work out. A wasp flew into my house a few years ago (I’m allergic) and I completely froze. My 3 year old son was much closer to it than I was, I should’ve moved him somewhere safer but I did not. My husband ended up walking in and helping us get rid of it while I stood motionless in my bedroom doorway. Sometimes I still feel a little shame over that - it wasn’t really a big deal, but to me it represented how I’m a bad mom for not jumping into action in an emergency. My mom has always been great in emergencies. 

But if I really analyze my life… that was ONE incident. And it wasn’t life threatening. Times my son tries to run in the street, I’ll stop him. Or if he’s been throwing up, I can use my quick mom-reflexes to grab the trash can right in time. I’m NOT a “bad mom” because of a wasp that tried to fly into a lightbulb for 20 minutes! And my mom screws up plenty too!

Then I think about all my successes. My in-laws are finally wrapping up a very messy divorce, and I’ve used my learned coping mechanisms to stay stable for my husband. My brother enlisted in the military, and I was able to be resilient and reliable for my family who needed me. And like I said - my son relies on me in TONS of ‘disaster’ situations! 

We aren’t gonna be perfect every time. In fact, I’m lucky if I peak at 75% efficiency most of the time. But compared to me at 13 I have definitely grown up and gotten better. I’m a little slower than other people but that’s fine. Some kids learn to read a little slower, and some kids have dyslexia. We don’t judge them for needing extra patience!

"If your experience is like mine, it might follow this pattern:

1. The skills feel clunky, clumsy and just all out awkward. They are hard to implement or even remember sometimes, and they don't feel useful.
2. You practice in low stakes situations or buy yourself at home applying them to past situations you've lived through - or current situations you face but aren't currently immersed in - allowing yourself more time to reflect. 
3. Eventually with this at home practice, you will notice an opportunity to apply a skill in real life and seize it, often to mixed results, but it's progress! You used a skill.
4. You keep practicing at home. It helps if you are an overthinker.
5. One day you are in therapy talking about a situation you faced, and your therapist points out that without realizing it, you applied a DBT skill and handled the situation accordingly. Hang on to that feeling as motivation.

"It seems to me that there aren't any DBT skills which directly deal with making (genuine) apologies and repairing harm caused to others by your own actions.

FAST references ""no apologies"", which is about not over apologising, because it can damage integrity and respect. This makes sense to me, but what about when you want to apologise an appropriate amount?

DEAR MAN has a good mechanism for expressing yourself clearly, but I understand it to be more goal/outcome oriented, and that feels kinda weird for an apology yknow? 

I guess GIVE makes some amount of sense in that it's a useful approach to take if you're trying to make an apology, but again, it seems more focused on validation.

Are there other skills that could be brought in? Maybe problem solving and check the facts? Radical acceptance?

Am I just overthinking this? I'd be interested to hear others' perspectives on this.

I definitely can see ways to use the existing skills so that I'm not apologising to people in ways that are manipulative, ineffective, damaging to respect, overly dramatic, etc. But I feel kinda lost as to like, an actual framework of guidance to follow. I find the step by step instructions of DBT so helpful and wish there was something like this for apologies. Maybe I need to accept that there isn't (!)

When I did my goals and values worksheet for ""Accumulate"", I wrote that integrity was important to me, specifically, repairing harm I've caused to others and taking responsibility for my actions, but I still feel like I've got a lot to learn in order to move more in line with this value.


EDIT: I am making this edit some good while after making the original post because I found something which may be of use in the handouts.

General handout 7a: Chain analysis, and general handout 8, Missing link analysis

These handouts deal with identifying problem behaviour, what chain of events led up to it, how could you be more skillful, is there anything getting in the way of skills, and in chain analysis it specifically mentions repairing consequences of problem behaviour. It doesn't go much into the repair part, but chain analysis could be an important part of understanding what happened if you have anything that needs an apology."	gobz_in_a_trenchcoat	post	22.090175520583806	female	White	0.01408219151198864	na	na	na	9	dbtselfhelp

"I learned about apologizing and repairing harm through the amends process of AA. A few tips 

- Focus on your own behavior. Even if the person you’re apologizing to also did something to hurt you, the apology is not the time to address it. 
- Figure out what kind of apology is most appropriate for the situation. A verbal “I’m sorry” isn’t always what the other person needs. Sometimes you need to pay back money, or respect someone’s desire for no contact, or show that you’re actively working to change behavior. 
- Ask how THEY want you to make it right. 
- Don’t make excuses. Even if you have good ones. If they ask for an explanation, that’s the time to provide it. 
- Be prepared for your apology to not be accepted. Don’t double down if they’re still angry or upset with you. Understand forgiveness might take time and respect their process."	gobz_in_a_trenchcoat	reply	na	na	na	0.01408219151198864	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I also wanted a step-by-step list on how to apologize properly and found that DBT didn’t offer this. 

I think you can modify either a dearman or validation stuff to fit an apology, if you wanna stay within DBT skills.

Dearman:

Describe what you did/said, the facts

Express how you feel about it (guilty, ashamed, sad, etc) 

Assert what you want (you could leave this out) — “I hope you can forgive me” or something very gentle because you don’t wanna really ask them to do something if you’re apologizing. But it could be good to have some sort of concluding bit / how to move forward. “I hope we can continue our relationship in the future” Or perhaps to conclude you could just say what you’ll do differently / how you’ll repair it. 

I would definitely use a lot of GIVE skills in this too.

For validation: I would use the “levels of validation.” I forget if this is in the DBT book directly but it’s definitely a DBT skill that DBT providers are taught. [This sheet might be helpful](https://www.dbtfamilyskills.com/uploads/2/4/8/4/24847301/validation_6___2_worksheet_1p_2016.pdf). 

Basically I would make a lot of effort to understand how your behavior has impacted them. Make them feel heard. If they’ve complained, make sure you understand their complaints and show you understand what they’re feeling. I would also try to figure out what the underlying need/needs they have are. (This is more of a Non-Violent Communication (NVC) skill than DBT but is definitely helpful here). And then try to address that in the future. 

For example if you’ve been really loud, perhaps they have a need for quiet that isn’t being met, and a need for peace especially after a long, tiring, stressful day… So you would first validate that, and then (action) say how in the future perhaps you can address this by being loud outside / in another room, or by having 30 minutes of quiet first… idk, I’m making this all up. Or give a few options and see what they like best. 

For example: “I know **I did x**, I know / I’m guessing (if they told you what they’re feeling or not) **you feel y** and **need z**. That must be really difficult (**validation**), especially given [**past situations** if applicable]. I would feel y too in that situation (**radical genuineness**). **I feel** really [guilty etc] for doing x and causing you pain, and I regret it. In the future **I will do** [your plan or suggestion of how to prevent this in the future]. How does that sound?”"	gobz_in_a_trenchcoat	reply	na	na	na	0.01408219151198864	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

THE FIVE LANGUAGES OF APOLOGY

Apology Language #1: Expressing Regret

Ask the person how you have hurt them.  Express regret as they share.  Expressing Regret sounds like, ""I feel awful about what I've done."" (said in an appropriate tone of voice).  Keep asking them if there is more until they have expressed all their hurt.

Apology Language #2: Accepting Responsibility

You need to take responsibility for what you have done.  No excuses.  This is as simple as saying ""I was wrong.  It was my fault."" But as simple as it sounds, many can't say those words.  Instead they say ""You were wrong or you made me…"" Accepting Responsibility apology language wants to hear, a simple admission of fault.  An “apology” without taking responsibility, is not a sincere apology. Accepting responsibility sounds like, ""I'm sorry. I was wrong. It was my fault.""

Apology Language #3: Genuine Repentance
 
Genuine Repentance is similar to Expressing Regret in that it must come from the heart. But it must also come with a promise to change, so the problem doesn't happen again.
Genuine Repentance sounds like, ""I'm sorry. It won't happen again and this is my plan to make sure that it will not.  I’m going to do (be specific and cite concrete ways you will exhibit that you are actually doing what is needed for the change to happen).
 
Apology Language #4: Making Restitution or Amends
Next, we come to Making Restitution. Making Restitution involves finding a way to make amends. You gotta make up for what you did. How you make up for it depends on the person. You have to make up for it in a way that the other person values. If you say ""I'm so sorry. Here is a pair of tickets to the game Sunday evening"" to someone who prefers cooking to sports, you're not making amends. ""Here is a pair of tickets to the filming of Iron Chef Sunday evening"" will work much better.   Making Restitution might mean doing what's needed to fix what you screwed up. It's probably the most labor-intensive apology language. Making Restitution or Amends sounds like, ""I'm sorry. I was sloppy. I'd be glad to help with the marketing report so you can go home early tonight.""
 
Apology Language #5: Requesting Forgiveness
Requesting Forgiveness asks the injured person to forgive. It lets them know they were wronged, that forgiveness is needed to repair the relationship. Even though you may believe that a request for forgiveness is implied in any apology, someone whose apology language is Requesting Forgiveness needs to hear it out loud.  An apology can be as simple as saying ""I was wrong.""  Keep in mind that a request for forgiveness won't necessarily be granted. The apology shows that you recognize the need to be forgiven. Whether or not the forgiving happens, however, is up to the person receiving the apology. Requesting Forgiveness sounds like, ""I'm sorry. Please forgive me.""  But if these are your only words, they will rarely be met with true forgiveness unless the offense was very minor.
 
Match Their Apology/Love Language, Not Yours
Since our primary apology language is how we recognize apologies, we tend to give apologies in the same language. After all, if ""I'm sorry"" means ""I'll make restitution,"" then we'll be tempted to make restitution when we want to apologize, even if the other person doesn't care about restitution, but does care about hearing us say, ""I was wrong.""  When you're receiving an apology, be sensitive to all 5 languages, not just your own. Even if someone isn't using your preferred apology language, they may be quite sincere, using their own. Listen for it. An apology is a special act, meant to make things better. Learn to give and receive apologies in a way that people can hear, and that repairs and strengthens your relationship.   Also think about which Love Language the other person hears best.  As much as possible, speak to them in their Love Language."	gobz_in_a_trenchcoat	reply	na	na	na	0.01408219151198864	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Was gonna bring this up! Or maybe something else that has a 5 in it?? because the thing that has been useful for me is a 5 stage apology, not 5 totally separate apology strategies (depending on how serious what you've done there can be less stages tho):

- State what has happened
- Acknowledge how they feel
- Express regret
- Say how you are going to prevent it from happening again
- Suggest or ask for things to do to make it up to them

Something like a 3 Rs - responsibility, regret, restitution

Years ago I was floundering and literally searched ""how to apologise"", and use it now even for things people are having big feelings about that I don't really feel I have to apologise for because words like ""sorry"" or ""apology"" don't even have to be involved, it's just about people wanting to feel heard"	gobz_in_a_trenchcoat	reply	na	na	na	0.01408219151198864	no	strong	strong	na	dbtselfhelp
"I’ve done a year and half of traditional DBT. My current therapist does RO-DBT. I don’t think she does traditional DBT. Thanks to being in a house fire back in May of 2021, my mental health has gone to shit. Before the house fire, I could say I was 90%-95% stable all the time. I can’t say that anymore. 

I think I need another round of DBT to help me stabilize again. What I’m wondering is if I would get as much out of RO-DBT like I did traditional DBT. I do plan on talking to my therapist and asking her about it. Except I won’t see her until September 9th. So, I guess I’m looking to see if anyone else benefited from doing RO-DBT."	gooseglug	post	46.59474764206945	male	White	0.9960856437683105	na	na	na	23	dbtselfhelp
"It depends on if you are having externalizing impulse control (dbt) type problems or internalizing over control (ro-dbt) problems. 

I only know about both modalities from reading workbooks but I think:

Ro-dbt has the same dialectic approach and core concepts like mindfulness and radical acceptance but it is intentionally less structured and there's less acroynms because the assumption is people with over control tendencies need to relax and chill...whereas stabdard dbt assumes people need to reign it in lol. It's more self-exploratory with less emphasis on interpersonal conflict. 

Thomas Lynch, the modalities creator, has a nice book and you can hear him on a few podcasts. People struggling with eating disorders and people on the autism spectrum, and people with ""quiet"" bpd are the main audience for ro-dbt I think."	gooseglug	reply	na	na	na	0.9960856437683105	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"I'm currently in the throes of pretty severe irritability and mood swings 100% related to my impending period. I have the most difficulty using skills during this time since the root vulnerability factor here is physiological and I feel like I have almost no escape from how bad I feel. Nearly everything enrages me or makes me want to cry and it's difficult to derive pleasure from things I normally find pleasure in. I feel like I'm doing okay with emotion regulation and interpersonal skills since I'm not blowing up at my boyfriend or taking out how crappy I feel on him as I've historically done. I'd like to keep that up and resist getting carried away in my thoughts and emotions because that's when I spiral and have a total breakdown of skills. 

I'm noticing pretty strong urges to fight my negative emotions, though, and definitely judgment towards myself (thinking I *shouldn't* feel this way since there's no obvious reason to/the reasons are irrational) so I'm thinking radical acceptance, distraction, and self-soothing may be the best skills to use, which I'm currently trying to do. Also, I'm feeling like being alone and doing comforting, distracting things by myself is the most effective thing for me right now but that means breaking plans with my boyfriend tonight, which I feel guilty for doing. Is it willful to break plans because I'm not feeling great mentally? 

Any thoughts on how to navigate or what other skills could be useful?"	caringiscreepyy	post	12.6525628173498	female	White	0.997931957244873	na	na	na	5	dbtselfhelp
"I feel you! Been there too. Sounds like you know what to do. My only advice is to have patience and compassion for yourself. It takes time to get to a place where skills feel more like ""second nature"" and our impending period feels less of a threat. Think of every period cycle as a way of practicing these skills. Trust and know that if you maintain the practice, no matter how hard (it is so hard), you'll feel better. 

I think it sounds like you're in wise mind, when you decided to break your plans for tonight and take care of yourself. A relationship always has a degree of separateness. Notice the feeling of guilt you have, validate it and know that when you're ready, you can always come back together.

"I can relate and first want to validate that it’s so incredibly frustrating to go through what you’re experiencing! I’ve found radical acceptance and mindfulness to be really helpful for me in these situations. 

I like to acknowledge that I know the cause (and therefore know it will end and that it’s not this big mysterious thing), that it sucks and it’s painful and I may feel a bit like I’ve regressed for a week or so and need to take extra good care of myself during that time, and that if I avoid a little more or my sleep hygiene gets messed up etc it’s okay and isn’t anything to feel shame over/doesn’t make me bad. I find the noticing aspect of mindfulness helpful because I can notice the pain, anxiety, irritability, etc. in a non-judgemental way. I also find that mindfulness to thoughts, mindfulness to emotions, and allowing emotions help. If I feel like crying, even if it feels silly or overblown, I just cry, and try to be non-judgemental toward myself. Anxiety is harder, but I’ve found reminding myself it has a cause and will go away eventually and isn’t likely to lead to a panic attack to be helpful and to allow me to not put so much energy into focusing on it. Not exactly a DBT skill, but it was also really comforting and validating to delve into disability and chronic illness communities on social media and to conceptualize my PMDD in that way. It helped me feel less blaming towards myself and less resistant in an unhelpful way to both the physical and emotional pain to frame it mentally to myself as having a chronic illness that can legitimately be somewhat disabling and that I therefore legitimately need to care for myself. 

I also agree with the other commenter that said it sounds like you made the decision to not carry out your plans with your boyfriend while you were in wise mind."	caringiscreepyy	reply	na	na	na	0.997931957244873	weak	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
When the PMDD symptoms start to roll in I always start with checking the facts.

I actually did the practice earlier while meditating of asking myself, ""Is this wise mind?"" and my answer was yes, which helped me feel better about my decision. I get caught up in the guilt, which causes me to judge and second-guess myself. As the day has progressed, I feel I've improved upon noticing that guilt and noticing the judgment and letting both just be.

"Thanks for your response and the validation! I really appreciate it.

I just need to work harder during this time to manage things and not fall back on destructive coping mechanisms while maintaining a solid level of compassion for myself. It's a tricky balance but definitely better than spiraling.

It helps to see that if you feel you've regressed in your goals a bit, you allow yourself leniency and aren't hard on yourself.

"Hi all,

I finished my first round of DBT skills group. (About 6 months long)

I feel like I’ve definitely improved, but I am having a hard time implementing these skills into everyday life. 

I have a “DBT diary card” app, but find I do not like it much. Is there another app anyone would recommend, and also what are some practices you guys use to remember to use your DBT skills? 

The most difficult thing is my emotions getting out of hand and then engaging in behaviors where emotion regulation/interpersonal effectiveness should be used. So I guess I need to focus on distress tolerance to then use ER or IE skills.

I also am continuing individual DBT therapy.

"One of the things that helped for me was to take one thing and really lean on it. I basically had the same thing, extremely difficult managing my emotions that then led to not so good consequences (either for myself or others). I loved when we made our ""survival kit"" for our five senses. Anytime I found myself in a situation when I was getting emotionally out of control, I would catch myself and immediately step away from the situation to eat a candy, or rub some rocks, or what not. By doing that it allowed me to do some breathing exercises and collect myself before trying to move on to other skills needed for the situation.

It's hard. When I finished my program I thought about immediately starting over but told myself to wait. One day it just clicked and I found myself doing things without even thinking about it *and before* they got too bad."	leedsdaggers	reply	na	na	na	0.747076690196991	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I would say firstly, practice the skills when you don’t need them! If you only try to find an ice pack to put against your head (as temp part of TIPP) when you’re at an emotional level 100 you’re probably going to feel too dysregulated or overwhelmed. If you’ve practiced, however, you’ll know where your ice pack is and it can feel more like second nature to grab it. Same with paced breathing. When I get really anxious I tend to switch between techniques and get stressed, whereas if I pick out one and have it as my go-to and practice it when I’m calm, I don’t have as hard a time. This applies beyond distress tolerance. Write and deliver a DEAR MAN for a simple request you’re not stressed about making, do a pros and cons of making different foods for dinner, etc. If it’s hard to remember to try out skills even when not distressed, try scheduling it in your calendar, setting a reminder on your phone, or working it into your daily routine (like always listening to a mindfulness meditation first thing in the morning before you get out of bed, or practicing paced breathing while you wait for your coffeemaker to do it’s thing).  

Secondly, have you taken advantage of phone coaching at all? Phone coaching is designed exactly for situations you’re talking about. When you’re in high distress and having trouble thinking of what skill to use or how to use it, you call your therapist and they can help walk you through it so that you don’t end up engaging in a coping mechanism that makes things worse.

Thirdly, you could spend some time in your individual sessions practicing the skills. For example, role plays with your therapist in-session to practice interpersonal effectiveness, practicing describing how you could use distress tolerance skills in moments of distress (if you’ve done behavior chains before you’ve had a chance to identify places where you could plug in skills to be more effective). You can also work with your therapist to come up with and write down specific instructions to use when you have certain urges, like “when I have the urge to self harm I will immediately get an ice cube and hold it in my hand for ten minutes.”

Fourth, and this kind of goes with the point above if you already have things written down, you can leave written notes/sticky notes around in your environment where you spend a lot of time each day to have an easy visual reminder of your skills."	leedsdaggers	reply	na	na	na	0.747076690196991	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"This is my first ever post on Reddit and it's quite long so please bear with me!

**Context:** I (F, 28) have struggled with anxiety and depression on and off for about 10 years (and also when I was a kid, from about 10-12 years old). I've taken medication, gone to therapy, and overall, I'm doing so much better than I was when I first started feeling bad. All my anxiety tends to be rooted in having control - not over other people, but myself. I hate flying, for example, because I hate feeling helpless. All that being said, nobody ever suspects I have this anxiety. I tend to be very outgoing, confident, and a good friend - it's important to me that I show up for other people, no matter how I'm feeling. My friends and family are extremely important to me, and I've been known to put their needs before my own in the past (context).

Anyways, for the past few years, my anxiety has been super manageable. That is until I had a rough bout of insomnia a few months ago. I would go days without sleeping and was essentially a zombie, all while still having to work and see friends. It all built up when one day, I was so tired (I think it was day 4 of no sleep) I had a full-blown panic attack. I hadn't had a bad one in years so this was really shocking for me. Eventually, I found some ways to make myself sleep (audiobooks, chamomile tea, making my bed every morning, and making my room a safe space), but the panic attack traumatized me. I felt pretty depressed for a few weeks after but eventually got better (part of this likely has to do with getting a dog, which really helped keep my mind busy).

**Now** it's been months since that panic attack, and everything in my life has been going great. I've been on vacation for the past few months visiting friends and family before starting my new job in October and ending it now on a trip to Ireland with my parents. Everything is going so well, that the other day I started thinking: ""how can everything be so perfect? why and how can I feel so happy? There must be something that will go wrong."" Which led to...""what if I get insomnia again and screw this vacation up?"" and ""What if I don't sleep tonight, or for another week? And then I disappoint my parents who planned this whole vacation because I'm too tired to do anything? and then I get another panic attack?"" And then I started getting nervous about the aspect of sleep and losing control. Suddenly, it freaked me out that I can't control when I fall asleep and it's just something that happens TO me. I'm supposed to just think about life and then wake up without knowing when or how? That freaks me out! And this is coming from someone who is a notoriously great sleeper, apart from a few bouts of insomnia! I can easily sleep for 14 hours no problem usually! Mind you, I have been able to sleep on this vacation and for the past few months. I go to bed nervous and thinking about it but then wake up after what feels like 1 minute when my alarm goes off. So none of my worries have actually happened, but the what-ifs make me so nervous all day and make it so I can't even really enjoy the vacation. I'm so nervous about what COULD happen I'm not even focusing on the present. This line of thinking and constant anxiety has started to make me think ""what if I get depressed again? what if that means I won't be the same fun person as before?"" I have so many events coming up (friends' wedding, friends visiting, my brother's wedding, and a trip with a guy I'm seeing), and I feel like if I get insomnia again or depressed again I'll disappoint everyone and myself.

This feels like such an inconsequential problem, and I realize that big picture, everything is fine. I just don't want to burden my parents by bringing this up and could use some tips/tricks on how you guys manage irrational fears and negative what-if scenarios that lead to spiraling.

"In terms of DBT skills, I would check out ""check the facts."" I think of it as a way to honor our thoughts and feelings - rather than saying ""this is irrational,"" we can say to ourselves, ""ok brain, thank you for that thought. Let me examine the evidence. Is this thought fitting the facts? Is it serving me?"" Then when the thought DOES fit the facts, you can do some problem solving; when it doesn't, you can do opposite action for the emotion (for example, if feeling anxious, act confident).

That said, I am wondering if you have discussed these worries with a therapist and gotten a clear diagnosis? I'm just an internet stranger, but to me what you are describing sounds a lot like OCD. There are some pretty good therapies for OCD  out there that might really help and be a good supplement to DBT skills alone."	ecarney	reply	na	na	na	0.0019897862803190947	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"Mindfulness could help here. I really like mindfulness of thoughts--it might be my favorite DBT skill. It can help you observe thoughts but not get ""hooked"" into them. The paced breathing part of TIP could help as well. I have a lot of distressing ""what-ifs"" as well. I've been practicing noticing these thoughts and bringing my awareness back to the present moment or to an action that aligns with my values. The thoughts can be there in the background.

I recently completed a 9-month course of DBT and I haven't seen as much improvement as I had hoped to. In fact, I got worse in my relationship, which is the reason I took DBT to begin with. Did anyone else not see much change at all at the 9-month mark and still improve later? I guess I was hoping if I keep working on it, I might still see improvements. It was a lot of new information to take in at first. I think it may have helped some in other areas of my life, like with a little more low-level stressors like doctor's appointments, etc. Thanks.

Someone told me once that growth and improvement is similar to moving something massive. At first you're pushing and pushing and straining every muscle, working as hard as you can. And eventually, seemingly out of nowhere, it starts moving. The inertia and movement starts to build up and you're able to finally see the change. That's how self-work is sometimes. It happens slowly over time and then all of a sudden, you notice the change. Keep working!

"It takes time, I did dbt 2 years ago and I'm only starting to really see the progress.
Sometimes it can be hard with the relationships, at first it was rough because we we're both learning to express ourselves and it would blow at times. Now our relationship is much better, we still argue although it's as far as it goes. We accept arguments now and it gets easier that way.

"Yes, this is not uncommon. Many people choose to repeat the cycle of the modules until they really feel grounded in them. 

While some people make huge strides and feel ready after one round of DBT skills modules, most people find that they need ongoing support and practice for a longer period of time.

Some people enter into a nine month program (or even longer) who are further along in their journey or who already have some coping skills in place, or who have pretty stable lives, and perhaps that period of time can feel like enough. 

But many people, in my experience, are coming to a nine month DBT course with a lot of life circumstances that need addressing, and this takes time. The skills need practice and repetition to take hold and become more second nature.

I continued to go to my DBT skills group for YEARS before I felt ready to set sail and move on from it. I became fluent in DBT and practice the skills every day. That's where I felt like I needed to be consistently in order to move forward.

"DBT is kind of like physical therapy - the appointments tell you what you need to practice outside of the session, and the amount you get back is tied to how much you are practicing. Are you practicing DBT skills daily? And that way you have access to them when high stress things come up?

If no, I would say to really dedicate the time. If yes... Then it's hard to say. Maybe you need more time or maybe you need to do some trauma processing work before you will really benefit from it."	MarshmallowCat14	reply	na	na	na	0.9983198046684265	no	no	strong	na	dbtselfhelp
Absolutely. It took me about a year to be able to start internalizing the tools and adapting them to my own needs and the way my brain works. It also takes time because some skills (especially emotional regulation and mindfulness skills) slowly change the way you think and react. I noticed these changes most intensely about two years after my first cycle of group.	MarshmallowCat14	reply	na	na	na	0.9983198046684265	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"This is the second time OP has posted on this topic. They did a DBT-informed informational online course but didn’t enroll in therapy (individual or group), and expressed that they are resistant to seeking individual therapy because therapy didn’t work for them in the past. 

To OP - DBT is an evidence-based form of therapy, and that evidence is based on a  *comprehensive* DBT program. If you aren’t in therapy, I don’t think it’s fair for you to attribute the therapeutic modality for your problems getting worse. An online class, podcast, or YouTube video is not a substitute for treatment under a licensed clinical professional.

DBT for me will be at the one year mark soon but I’m scheduled to graduate from it in January. A thing that helped my relationship was something called Love and Logic parenting course, took years ago.

Yes, I mentioned it briefly in a comment on one of the group's weekly intro. threads a couple weeks ago. Just wanted input from others who have been doing this longer than me.

I went back and read your other comment in the other thread referenced below and it’s unfortunate you can’t afford an individual therapist/ that it’s out of network for you as that will work best. Idk if the course you did also had group sessions too? I’m doing it online at the moment through essentia health in Australia and it has the modules you watch videos on and look at the handouts then we have a weekly group zoom meeting and I also have an individual psych I see weekly or every two weeks depending on what’s going on in my life at the time. The first time I did it was one on one just with my individual therapist and I think what I’m doing now is way more ideal. But even with the way I’m doing it, it is very common to repeat modules to practice the skills and get them down pat:)	MarshmallowCat14	reply	na	na	na	0.9983198046684265	weak	no	strong	na	dbtselfhelp

"OP, it doesn't surprise me that you can't find a DBT therapist who takes insurance, because of the low fees that insurance pays -- real DBT includes phone coaching and a weekly consultation team for your therapist, so it's just not worth what they pay. But if you've ever been admitted to a hospital psychiatric unit, have thoughts of suicide regularly, or have been diagnosed with Borderline, you should be able to find a DBT therapist who is willing to do a ""single case agreement"" where they pay the therapist as if they ARE in the network."

"Yeah, I understand what the full DBT entails. The DBT therapist in my area takes insurance, but it's out-of-network and a lot more than I feel comfortable paying in addition to what I already pay for my group class. I had an appointment set up and discussed the money concerns with them over the phone and they said nothing could be done about that. No, I don't meet those criteria and don't have an official diagnosis of that (I have BPD traits, at least). I've seen probably 11 individual therapists throughout my life and none ever helped. One claimed to do DBT but she definitely did not. During our first session, she told me I was worrying about ""stupid shit."" I did not go back. The group class has helped me  A LOT more than any therapist ever did. I've never been to a hospital psychiatric unit and never plan to. Sounds like pure hell.

So, I can't right now. Just got off the phone with a tech rep who was helping us reset our networks on our mobile devices.

It seemed she was in a foreign country as many call centers are.  Her accent was thick.  She was very kind, professional, and capable and helped resolve my issue.

During the call, she heard one of my cats chirping. She said, ""Do you have a cat??"" very excitedly.  I thought I misheard her and then she repeated.

I told her I do.  She said she lives with her aunt and isn't allowed to have a cat there; but she's saving up very seriously to buy or rent her own place, at which time, she's going to adopt a cat.

At the end of the call, she said she would never forget my name and is going to name her kitty after me!  I said, ""You're going to name your cat Debbie?!"" She said yes.

My heart is so warmed!  A few years ago I took a class that involved reading a book on various conditions women around the world face, including in many of the countries where these call centers are located.

You never know what someone is going through.  Please always be kind and as patient as you can be. You're speaking to a human being with a soul, a beating heart, dreams, loved ones, and hopes, just like you.

I have to admit, I was feeling like I wanted her to go at a faster pace and was starting to get impatient and even talked over her a couple of times, but  then I noticed.  I mindfully took a breath and then  practiced the DBT Skill of GIVE."	DBTPath	post	33.87051592327623	female	White	0.0012757532531395555	na	na	na	9	dbtselfhelp

"My coworker/friend (who I used to be romantically interested/obsessed with) and I hooked up a few times. It never concerned me because he genuinely cares about me as a friend, plus over time I realized we weren’t compatible and I lost interest romantically. But I am still obsessed with him and want his attention. I’m going through a major depressive episode and I don’t have energy to date, so its good to have cuddles/sex with someone who I feel safe with. I enjoy being around him because his presence calms my anxiety and uplifts my mood.

But recently we haven’t hooked up as frequently, and my other coworker made a comment/joke that he might be looking for a girlfriend. 

I knew it would end someday. I’m glad that he’s potentially found someone. But I don’t even have confirmation about this! My mind is spiraling and catastrophizing with all these anxieties and jealous thoughts. Also I’m ignoring him because I think he’s ignoring me, so if I cut him off then it will be on my watch. Maybe this situation is all in my head and I’m reading too much into it, or maybe its real. He’s not the type of guy to explicitly say that its over so I’m not going to ask unless he asks first. I don’t see the point in it, and I’m ok with not asking. If he asked me, I would go over. 

I’ve been writing in my journal which helps get out emotions but I still spiral. I don’t need relationship advice or answers to my anxieties, just DBT skills to cope. Any advice on skills to help get over an obsession, deal with anxieties and spiraling, trying to abandon someone before they abandon you, or anything else applicable to this story?"

"First, I find it useful to do an Emotional Regulation flow:

**Identify/Label Emotions**  
Identify the emotions you're experiencing. Try to break a complex one like ""grief"" into components like ""fear"", ""sadness"" etc. and ask which is giving you the most trouble. Jealousy might be a good one (as in fear of losing someone or having lost something, not envy), but there are a bunch of options.

**Check the Facts**  
Do your best to not let this get taken over by Emotion Mind. What is causing you to feel this way? What is true about the situation and what is your reaction or emotion? What is the emotion trying to communicate directly, even if it isn't helpful?

**Problem Solve**  
If everything is an appropriate response and intensity, time to problem solve. I'll assume this isn't the case.

**Opposite Action**  
Opposite Action is the go-to here. For me, this means looking inward to how I would make myself happy and feel the positives I'd felt before, or experience what I would have before. I might not actually feel that way, but it's helpful for slowing things down.  


If you find any of this to be too difficult to do at the moment, you don't feel capable of trying Opposite Action right now, or you're not finding enough relief, it's a good time to check in with yourself and see if **Distress Tolerance** can be useful.

**TIPP (Temperature, Intense Exertion, Paced Breathing, Progressive Muscle Relaxation)**

I use ice plunges often when things feel out of control. Use your best judgment and don't be afraid to pull in Wise Mind **ACCEPTS** or **IMPROVE** the moment if those work better for you. When I use these skills I also do a quick check from **PLEASE** to ensure I'm caring for myself, eating, sleeping, etc. Physiological responses can make things far more difficult.

**Turn the Mind**

Turning the Mind means reframing the subject of your concentration on something else that is more helpful, and is a key skill to practice. Radical Acceptance is thrown out a lot for ""accept you can't do anything about this problem"", but to do that is very difficult and takes a lot of experience, practice, and changes from moment to moment. Working on turning the mind is a powerful way to make this a bit easier.

If I feel lonely, I'll try to find a way to shift to an activity like ""Participate/Contribute"" and write a surprise postcard to an old friend, or find some way to connect with someone from before, someone who might also be lonely, etc. I find that Turning the Mind works best / is stickiest when I do something or focus on something in close alignment with my values. If it's especially hard, I make the thing I focus on the above PLEASE skills, and will even text a friend what I intend to accomplish like ""I'm going to eat a sandwich before noon"" and check in for accountability.

Responses like this are tough because the progress in finding closure operates on a different time scale than the pacing of our own distress. Steady care and remembering this is about dialectics (you can mourn while doing what you love; you can be lonely when with friends you love; you can be anxious and worrisome but turn your attention elsewhere, etc) will help bolster you up in the meantime. You've got this.

Aww I'm so glad. If it's any encouragement, I still do these flows myself and I've been involved with DBT for ~6-7yrs. It takes a lot of practice to adapt the tools to fit your needs and loves, but it's super worthwhile. +1 to ACT as well, defining my values more clearly was extremely helpful for me.

Hello everyone. I was hoping to get some suggestions on skills to apply when you have to do something that you don’t want to and spend the whole day dreading it (even when it turns out to be not so bad). Whenever my in-laws come for dinner I dread it for days ahead of time and use it as an excuse to self sabotage or damage my relationship with my husband. It is never as bad as I expect but I keep falling into this pattern. Any suggestions on skills to try out?	outcase	post	19.29756587041485	male	White	0.9970840811729431	na	na	na	15	dbtselfhelp
You could also use cope ahead. Sometimes planning for the worst helps us to feel better. You haven’t detailed why you expect dinners with your in-laws to go so terribly, but you could run through the things you’re worried about and think of solutions. It can be things you’d do on the evening itself, i.e. when my father-in-law asks about xyz, I will politely tell him I don’t want to talk about it. Or something to deal with the emotions you’ll feel afterwards, i.e. when they leave, I will have a relaxing bath with a candle. It can help to write these down and really brainstorm.	outcase	reply	na	na	na	0.9970840811729431	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
I would recommend HOW skills for this.	outcase	reply	na	na	na	0.9970840811729431	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"I also have this problem. If I have an appointment or meeting in the afternoon my morning will be shot.

The most effective skill for me (if I actually use it) is opposite action.

If you like to anticipate unpleasant events by ruminating all day, or otherwise wasting time or numbing out - this is me nine out of ten days but I'm also working on it with DBT and have seen it work! - the opposite action would be to:

1. Stop ruminating or fixating about the dinner or whatever you are dreading.
2. Make a decision on what to do next and commit to following through. Do NOT recycle options in your head while scrolling on your phone and zoning out and end up never making a decision. Be confident that you have made your decision on how you would like to spend the next hour and that you will now do it.
3. In these situations my emotion brain usually has the thought that 'I don't have enough time to do anything worthwhile before I have to cope ahead for the dreaded event.' Instead, try having the opposite thought: 'I have plenty of time and mental space and clarity to do a number of tasks and activities before my dinner plans."" I usually calculate the hours remaining and then try to find tasks/activities that would fit well in that time frame.

Good luck!"	outcase	reply	na	na	na	0.9970840811729431	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"In addition to coping ahead, checking the facts is a good place to start. In the parlance of CBT, it sounds like you're [fortune telling](https://cogbtherapy.com/cbt-blog/cognitive-distortion-fortune-telling) (i.e., jumping to conclusions or predicting the future), so examining the evidence and your interpretations/assumptions could be a useful exercise. 

If that doesn't work, then go to opposite action or problem-solving, depending on if the emotion is justified or effective. 

Also, if you're still in a comprehensive DBT program, then you can also call your therapist for individual coaching."	outcase	reply	na	na	na	0.9970840811729431	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
I 100% agree with cope ahead. Taking 30 or even 60 minutes to run through a plan of attack for each terrible thing that could happen is so much less draining than ruminating about it and dreading it for hours or days.	outcase	reply	na	na	na	0.9970840811729431	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"This topic's been pretty hard to digest because it just reminds me of every time someone has pressured me to do something I didn't want to do, mocked me for not doing what they wanted, or didn't give me a choice in the first place. I'm more of a fawn/freeze type so something like standing up and saying ""no"" to people is actually really difficult for me, it's something I need *more* of in my personality instead of passive and passive-aggressive avoidance. So this unit is very counterintuitive for me.

I get not trying to control what's not in my control, that's what the letter of it says. But when I look up videos people take it exactly where my Negative Voice is saying- using examples like not wanting to go to a party, as though there's no valid reason someone might want that. I'm seeking the dialectical middle path here where I am accepting reality and still allowed to make choices and tell people ""no, I don't like that."""

I found it helpful to look internally for examples first- like, when I know I should take my meds/try to use a skill instead of a negative coping method but don’t feel like it, that’s me being willful and not making the healthier choice for myself in that moment.

"This might sound weird but I like using the mindfulness skill ""ask wise mind a question"".

"My initial thought is that willfulness is when you're not doing something or you're saying ""no"" and it harms you/is ineffective, vs. setting a boundary is when you're not doing something or saying ""no"" and it helps you/is effective. You could try using wise mind or check the facts to determine whether something will be effective or not. I also wonder if the interpersonal effectiveness skill of prioritizing goals could be helpful. If you're prioritizing self respect and someone asks you to a party and you don't want to go, saying ""no"" could be you respecting your own needs and boundaries. If you're prioritizing the relationship and someone asks you to go to a party and you don't want to go, saying ""yes"" could be respecting your goal to maintain a good relationship with your friend."

"Hi! I’m struggling and I keep looking into my book, but I am not sure which skill to use and I want to get other opinions before diving into random skills.

Basically I am struggling with guilt of past mistakes. I had my best friend/FP leave me after multiple years of me lashing out because of my BPD (but she also had unaddressed issues) and now I have a new best friend/FP. We recently had a miscommunication and it wasn’t a huge deal but we both kind of made each other feel bad and we both apologized and admitted our wrongs. The issue is, I’m struggling to accept that I hurt her. I keep thinking now that we’ve had our first issue, I’ve “broken the seal” and I will keep making mistakes until my new best friend leaves me as well. Like a “3 strikes and you’re out” kind of thing. She told me that if I didn’t make mistakes I would be famous for it and she’ll still be there because she cares more about me than silly mistakes. 

What skills can I use to not feel guilty about my part since I’ve already apologized and things are normal? I don’t want to bring it up to her again our of fear of risking making it worse or dwelling on it, but there are things I didn’t bring up that are still bothering me and I don’t know how to just let it go."

"I would check the facts on your guilt. What were your actions? How she feels is not in your control, but what you say and do is. 

Maybe almost think of the dearman format — “she felt bad when I said x.” Not “I made her feel x.” 

Remind yourself of the facts and correct your actions where you can. Beyond that, don’t dwell on it and try to refocus on the present (participate, one thing in the moment)"	Echidna_Intelligent	reply	na	na	na	0.9912817478179932	no	no	strong	na	dbtselfhelp
Also dialectical thinking (holding multiple truths at once.) for example- just because you made mistakes, doesn’t mean you’re a bad person. Even if she makes mistakes, it does not make her a bad person! You can make mistakes and still be a good person. Everyone messes up and makes mistakes, and that doesn’t reflect their character!

"Heard. I’ve been through a very similar situation and the idea of trusting myself within a relationship was one of the toughest challenges for me. What helped me came from our couples therapist so it’s not 100% DBT but I think ties into the ideals pretty well.

I had hit a rock bottom point of “I hurt someone I love so how can anyone - especially her - ever love me back?” Recovery started with apologizing for the mistake and her acceptance of that (like you already know, we all make mistakes). Then it was acceptance of that fact: no matter what I do, with all of the best intentions, I will still make mistakes. The fear of doing the wrong thing was basically sabotaging me so letting it go helped a lot. It also helped a lot to realize I couldn’t control every little thing in a relationship, but I can control how I react to challenges and how I communicate about them.

I work at an unnamed popular coffee. i have worked  with this company for about a year, but have been a barista for about 7 years at other chains. For a couple of months now, a coworker has been finding pretty much any excuse to “correct” me behaviour. At first I understood cause I knew she wanted to be a barista trainer and needed to show our supervisors she was prepared. But now she has gotten that position and this hasn’t stopped. It brings up a lot of feelings in me and triggers some of my target behaviours (SH and SA) which isn’t her fault, how is she too know. But it’s getting to a point where I’ve let it build so much, out of fear of confrontation, that I don’t know how to proper respond without knowing I’m going to blow up. I know I work with her over the whole long weekend and I just know I’m going to break how do I either a) approach her about the issue and explain my self or b) respond in the moment in a way that won’t get me fired? I know there is a DBT skill on this but my counsellor cancelled our appointment yesterday and I know I won’t make it to Wednesday without a breakdown.

"Hey there.  Ugghhh! So sorry you're dealing with this.  I would visit the Interpersonal Effectiveness module.

The first step is to identify your goal, and that will lead you to the skill that can be most effective.

|:-|:-|
|get what you want or set a boundary (sounds like it!)|DEAR MAN|
|keep the relationship or make it the priority|GIVE|

Hey first of all it seems to me there is a lot of radical acceptance in your post. This person is treating you in a manner you find upsetting but you understand your vulnerability factors make this more challenging for you. You have also expressed concerns that you might react negatively in trying to confront this. This is really good because it shows you have a strong understanding of your situation and now you can go on to using skills. Following up on what others have said, this is definitely a situation for interpersonal skills. The first question to ask now is what priority do my objectives vs the relationship hold to me. If your objectives are more important, keep that in mind during the engagement. Be clear in your goals, calm in your reasoning yet also direct in your statements. I recommend DEARMAN and also FAST as the skills to use for you in this particular situation.

"Hey everyone- I recently got the McKay/Wood/Brantley workbook and have begun working through it. I got to the section on radical acceptance, which is something I want to work because I frequently slip into self-hate when I think of past mistakes.

The book included this as a possible exercise: ""Read a controversial story in the news without being judgmental about what has occured""

I think this could be a good one to implement since I read a lot of news and so I will have a lot of time to practice. How does this work- do I just try to absorb the fact of what is happening without making a moral judgement about whatever it is? Will practicing this with news help me to think about things in my past without hating myself for it? Does anyone use this technique as a way of practicing radical acceptance?

"I personally don't find this technique useful but I found a 'reality acceptance worksheet' online that asks three easy questions,  list a few things after each question. 

1) realities than I am refusing to accept :
2) behaviors I do when I'm refusing to accept reality (may look like a tantrum, giving up, manipulating, arguing etc): 
3) How I experience SUFFERING when I refuse to accept reality:"	KirisTor	reply	na	na	na	0.0017083006678149104	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
I don’t know the way I think about radical acceptance has basically made me a determinist. Everything would make sense if you knew all the initial conditions. I would caution to maybe pick something not TOO out there, like a senseless murder or something. (I specifically ignore the news to not hear about those things but then people tell me anyway!)

"Re: ""How does this work- do I just try to absorb the fact of what is happening without making a moral judgement about whatever it is?""

I'd suggest incorporating mindfulness by noticing your moral judgements, rather than trying to not have any—they might happen reflexively. And also notice your emotions/physical sensations, and be curious and open to them."	KirisTor	reply	na	na	na	0.0017083006678149104	no	no	strong	na	dbtselfhelp
That sounds more like practicing non-judgementalness than radical acceptance to me, but I guess the two skills kind of go together. I’m working out of Marsha lindhans book, she’s the one who created DBT.	KirisTor	reply	na	na	na	0.0017083006678149104	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp
That's an interesting point I hadn't considered. If determinism is true and free will is an illusion, it would be a lot easier to forgive yourself and not be upset about the past- you didn't have a true choice in the matter after all. I'd just wonder how you square that with the need to maintain the belief in free will, illusion or not, in order to drive your life forward and make better choices. I can see taking a determinist view to examine my past, but I dont want to let it become an excuse for me not getting done what I need in the present.

It made me a determinist, then a nihilst, then an absurdist, then a humanist. I don't think the self actually exists, there is no free will, and change is the only constant - where a person seems not to change, they are wasting energy maintaining an ego. If the universe were started again as an experiment we'd see exactly the same results, all of our thoughts are just entropy, and we are made of stardust - but also, nothing really means anything 🤷🏻	KirisTor	reply	na	na	na	0.0017083006678149104	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp
"Well the thing is we can never know all the initial conditions. So a choice you think is free will is influenced by a lot of hidden variables. I talked about this in my applied philosophy class the text said people need to believe in free will to be able to better themselves (the author in that article was a counselor) but I’m not so sure about that. I think all my choices make sense based on everything that has happened to me what I’m aware of and what I’m not aware of. I think I’m making all the decisions but some omniscient observer could maybe say how it isn’t so. There’s even regular people who believe that way I know many people who think everything is decided by God already

So I agree with you it’s not very useful for future decisions in practice this might mean thinking you have free will but I really think if we understood enough we would see it doesn’t exist"	KirisTor	reply	na	na	na	0.0017083006678149104	no	strong	no	na	dbtselfhelp

Totally agreed, the philosophical case for determinism is solid.  My question is more of a practical one.

"I am on waiting list for DBT.  I started to practice mindfulness and interpersonal effectiveness skills from the DBT workbook as I don't want to wait to make a change in my life and I am struggling with the dialectic of non-judgement and staying true to your values.

As part of 'how' skills, you should 'acknowledge your values, your wishes, your emotional reactions, but don’t judge them' and discriminate but not evaluate. Cringing is evaluating. I am able to register my cringe at something and then do it anyway, and if it is the DBT way then I can force myself to do it. But, doing that makes me feel ashamed. In the past, I have suppressed my cringing in a people-pleasing way and pushed through the cringe to be accepted.

But for interpersonal effectiveness also asks me to stay true to my values. It is very difficult for me to know what my values are and they change frequently. Cringing is involuntary, it is coming from me, so it seems like a good way to know where my boundaries, preferences and tastes are that stay stable over time. It is almost a physical warning signal of something I don't identify with and don't want to be like.

Recently, a person I wanted to get closer to invited me to join a hobby that I consider cringe, and I ended up declining and I felt a sense of self-esteem afterwards for that decision. My intense cringe in this situation helped me recognise my preference before I knew it was a boundary related to my values, but it also doesn't feel good to judge people.

Has any who has been through DBT thought about this before and what do you do with your cringe when it comes up?"	Hangerregret	post	27.443400999638364	female	White	0.008883916772902012	na	na	na	11	dbtselfhelp
"Hi! Have you had a look at the emotional regulation skills? They may be of some help with this. My advice for how to honour your ""cringe"" reaction while still trying to be non-judgemental would be a ""check the facts"". Specifically, taking time to describe your emotion, and the situation that provoked it, in strictly factual terms. I would like to suggest that cringe can be considered a form of disgust. In. The emotional regulation hand outs, emotions are labelled and grouped under types (anger, shame, sadness, etc.). This can be really helpful for correctly identifying the emotion and your action urges. Cringe could fit under disgust, which also encompasses things like ""dislike"" and ""repulsion"".

 The emotion of ""dislike"" can fit the facts when you are exposed to someone doing something that goes against your values. It might cause an action urges to move away from that person, or distance yourself.

Based on the facts, it's up to you to decide whether your action urge and your emotion and its intensity fit the facts, and whether it's effective to act on it. If it is, great! Consider also tying in pros and cons to make sense of the potential consequences of an action if you're unsure.

Another example, maybe your emotion (cringe) causes you to have an urge to ruminate on your dislike for someone or something, and this feels ineffective because it causes you distress or causes you a secondary unpleasant emotion like shame or anger. You could then use the skill ""opposite action"" to mitigate that urge. E.g. act opposite to your urge to distance yourself from something.

I think it's important though to acknowledge when your emotion does fit the facts, because that is okay! You could give yourself some validation, words of encouragement."	Hangerregret	reply	na	na	na	0.008883916772902012	weak	no	strong	na	dbtselfhelp
"In my experience one of the big keys is just making a deliberate effort to be kind & understanding to yourself

It can help to sort of allow the cringe to be whatever it wants to be, acknowledge that it's there, and then respond accordingly—if it's mild enough that you can still proceed while tolerating some mild or moderate discomfort then you can go ahead, whereas if it's too intense for you to move forward with whatever activity is causing you to react this way, you can just be open & honest about how it makes you uncomfortable

You may even be able to take back some control at that point by suggesting an alternative that you would be comfortable with—I think it's about being as radically honest & accepting as you can about your limits & boundaries, both with yourself and with the people you're with"	Hangerregret	reply	na	na	na	0.008883916772902012	weak	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

"So, before it became a word for a whole sub-set of reactions like 1-3 years ago, the word ""cringe"" just described a physical reaction. Next time you feel this way, I'd Observe and Describe what happens in your body when you feel this way. Learning to know what the physical experience is will help you de-couple your judgement. It may also help you tune into other physical aspects of your intuition, which is helpful for Wise Mind development."	Hangerregret	reply	na	na	na	0.008883916772902012	no	no	no	na	dbtselfhelp

Thanks both for helping me! I think based on gobz answer it could go either way, but the difference is that I stop to think and pay attention to what's right for me before making any decisions that I might regret.

"Procrastination is a helpful example for me. Let's say I have work due tonight.

Willful: I act as if my comfort is more important than my commitment to finish my work. So I convince myself of various lies that do not match up with reality as it truly is, something like 'This time I'll really start earlier but just righttttt after I watch one more episode.' Like most other times, I don't stop at one episode and end up having a stressful evening caused by my own willfulness.

Willing: I accept reality as it is and acknowledge that I have historically had problems with finishing work on time and on avoiding work until the last minute. I know that unless I take different actions this time, I will end up with those same results. So instead of turning on the TV, I put a block on the TV until 5pm and dive into my assignment in a different room.

"Friday nights have been historically hard for me since I was a teenager. I spiral, I feel completely lonely, left out, miserable, that other people are out there being 'cooler' than me. I've become fearful of weekends and much more comfortable with weeknights. 

I'm guessing the skills that mostly would be used in this situation is some kind of self-care/self-soothing, read a book, watch a movie, do something pleasant. But then I still feel like a big loser because I think about all the people who are out and about and me sitting at home alone just reading a book.
