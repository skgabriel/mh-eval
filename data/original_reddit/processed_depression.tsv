"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here."	circinia	post	25.13459702432763	female	White	0.0023336925078183413	na	na	na	395	depression

I was at the gym and it was raining quite hard. While resting after a set (looking outside through a window), a couple of kids pass by and wave at me. I obviously waved back, but as they got closer to the foggy window, one of the kids drew ""=)"" and the other did a heart.

I couldn't help but smile and make a heart sign with my hands to them. It almost brought me to tears since I've been struggling so much lately. It felt like a sign to keep pushing through. I will never forget this."	circinia	reply	na	na	na	0.0023336925078183413	no	strong	no	na	depression

First time here, have been feeling very useless and unmotivated lately. I’m fine at work- I know how to switch on my “game face” but outside of that I just feel so… blah and down. I’ve been depressed before so I guess I’m just going through it again. I have things I should be doing and I’m not doing them, and things I want to do but I don’t really care to do them or put in the effort. I would like to hit a fast forward button on my life sometimes. I’m 49 and I don’t necessarily want to live another 25-30 or whatever the average is. I also know I should be grateful for all the good things and people in my life and I am and would love to shake off this downcast feeling that’s been following me around.	circinia	reply	na	na	na	0.0023336925078183413	no	strong	no	na	depression
"It's days like today that I seriously consider killing myself.

I am so exhausted worrying about this stuff anymore.  I don't want to worry about anything anymore.  Why does this stuff keep happening?  Why can't we move on in a good, happy, positive way?  Why is it okay for me to be in pain but if I kill myself I cause others pain?  

I can't fucking do this anymore.  I am exhausted.  I can't sleep because I worry about things and then I'm woken up by a phone call because something I worried about happened.  And people think *I'm* crazy.  I probably fucking am at this point.  This shit drives me to insanity.

I can't. fucking. do. this. anymore.

I seriously wish I wasn't brought here on this planet.  Every time.  Every god damn time things start to get good someone pulls the god damn plug on it.  Might as well just pull the god damn plug on myself.  I fucking hate this.

All I want to do is sleep.  I just want to stay in my room, not talk to anyone, not do anything, not go anywhere, I just want to stay in my room and go to sleep, stay asleep.

"Sometimes other peoples happiness triggers me and I'm not too proud of it. I'm not saying I'm not happy for them, especially my friends. I love to see my friends thrive and get all the things they want but it only shows me what I don't have or can't get. I'm exhausted trying to hobble together the shambles of a life (that on the outside looks fine I guess because I'm high functioning). I'm grasping at straws and trying every and anything but nothing works. I'm lonely and just generally unhappy and overwhelmed more days than not and just looking at people seem to get things way easier is killing me. 

I don't like feeling jealous but I don't know how to stop. People are like focus on what you have and focus on being glad that you have life but the life itself is hard on me and I don't feel the good outweighs the bad.

"I keep thinking of how to do a big self harm by>! slitting my wris!<

The first time anyone reached out to me in months, and it was a pyramid scheme. And I fell for it, tried to sign up for it, because I felt like I was valuable. They felt like I was a clown.   
I am so utterly worthless. I mean that in the most literal sense.

There is no money to my name. And no one will hire an UGLY woman. A detrans FTMTF. I should have been an abortion. I have the wrong genes, and they make my face so ugly that I can't even leave the house. 

I have no hirable, workable skills either.  Nobody, and I mean nobody that ever talked to me can contain their absolute disgust. I just want to leave the house and talk to other people, but there is no point. 

A slow painful death by starvation is all that awaits me. But maybe if I speed up the job, it might be better? Idk. I'm 35 years old with 0 dollars to my name. My teeth are rotted out.   
My hair is a wiry mess and I'm balding. 

Even in highschool, men's first reaction to me was try to convince IT to commit suicide. I was always called an it.  GOD I AM SO DUMB WHY DID I LET MYSELF GET HAPPY FOR .02 SECONDS by assuming someone wanted to talk to me/interact with me/hire me.

I hate the suicide support line. It a trap, if you call them and you're ACTUALLY depressed, not just sad, they'll just call the cops on you. If you're lucky the cops will leave, but they might kidnap you, throw you in a mental hospital (prison). Then it's forced drugs for a couple of days and thousands in debt. There's literally no one I can talk to. It's so unfair. The whole point of the suicide hotline is to call the cops on you.

"Last week and this past weekend has really been triggering for me. I not only ran into my abusive ex not once, but twice during that time, and I felt nothing but rage. You know how Homer chokes out Bart in The Simpsons? I wanted to do that to her, but I didn't. 

I'm still angry at how she treated me but also angry at myself for allowing it for as long as I did. It also made me angry to see her treating her new girlfriend better than she did me. I don't understand why I wasn't deserving of basic decency or what I did wrong.

I'm also feeling like a failure as my relationship ended a month ago, and I feel it's my fault. To make matters worse, I found out my ex and a (former) friend were seeing each other, likely while my ex and I were still together. 

As pathetic as this sounds, I can't stop replaying a conversation a friend and I had yesterday. The conversation re-confirmed how I feel about myself, and I'm tempted to end the friendship. The way she spoke to me yesterday is the reason I have a hard time opening up and isolate myself as is.

I wanted to post this small achievement.

Baseline, I'm messy and disorganized.

Just learned that even with insurance, I won't be able to afford any treatments. Blood work actually showed something treatable, but the blood work itself costed over $1000 with insurance. I've been unable to see a psych for almost a year and have been strung along in overpriced therapy sessions. I officially cannot afford to treat my mind or body.

"I'm tired, both mentally and physically. My anxiety prevents me from making a whole post about it here, I don't wanna be seen as a crybaby either. I just wish I wasn't seen at all. Everything would be much easier that way. I knew a depressive episode was coming but that didn't mean I was somehow ""prepared"" for it. I don't know where else to go and where to talk to, I'm extremely lonely and if I got into why I'm like this today it would be too long, no one cares, no one wants to read all that & no one is gonna be able to do anything about it. I can't even bring myself to look for psychological help, which I'm aware I need. I have zero confidence and my whole entire life I've been made to feel like I was not enough and like I was lacking, like I was behind other people. There are certain days when I hit rock bottom and feel like there's no point in going on, I try to distract myself and tell myself that everybody's trying, everyone's working in one way or the other, and that I have to as well instead of sitting there and crying about it. I guess that used to provide some temporary motivation but I'm back to ground zero and I'm questioning everything including that mindset. Why should I have to be a part of the struggle? Why do I have to keep pushing myself? What am I contributing anyways?

"I’ve spent today crying. My mum is terminally ill. She’s starting to get dementia so conversation doesn’t make sense then she gets aggressive when I try to understand- then some days she’s fine. She’s in a wheelchair and has no use of her hands so I have to do everything, and she’s starting to get up in the middle of the night so I have to be hyper aware even when I’m sleeping, if that makes sense, as she’s fallen in the past. I’m so tired. I love her, so I do what I have to.

I had a confrontation this morning with a workman who was chopping down a local tree she likes to sit in her wheelchair and watch. It’s in someone else’s garden so They can do what they like and no-one can stop them. He just sent a lot of vile abuse my way. So that’s something else that’s been taken away from my mum in her last months. I didn’t even care that confrontation might have been unsafe.

It’s affecting my daily life. I accidentally made a driving mistake the other day that could’ve been serious, and only luck that it wasn’t. Only luck that I didn’t have legal consequences.

"My dad passed away from alcoholism years ago. My grandpa had a huge alcohol problem and had recently passed from cancer. My mother tells me to stay away from alcohol which I do for the most part. I enjoy a drink during holidays or rare events. 
I am a college student majoring in Civil Engineering as a junior. Everyday I eat healthy, take my vitamins, make sure to have proper nutrition, and I exercise hard. I work my ass off each and every day to have a better life. Everything I do is to make sure that kids don’t have it the way I did, and to make my mom and family proud! 
The other day my mom came over to my place(I moved out 2 years ago because we argued a lot). She came to the door drunk, and crying that a guy had assaulted her. After calling my aunt, I had found out that my mom is a developing alcoholic and she had been an alcoholic in the past.
The last thing I could ever want is for my mom to ever loose her life from alcohol. It is really hitting me hard. Recently she lost her best friend to suicide and everyday I feel that she will do the same 
I tell myself to be strong, but my head throbs and all I want to do is scream and cry with the thought that I would never see her again and everyone around me are dying.

I am not sure if this is just depression, or if it's also anticipatory grief, but sometimes I'm hit with profound sadness that feels like grief when I think about my parents dying. They are both completely fine and healthy right now. But they're getting up there in age. So it feels like death is always imminent since I lost my both of my grandpas when they were even younger than my parents currently are now.

There’s nothing much to look forward to in life except the occasional one week vacation that is over too soon. This is stupid.

I've taken anti anxiety meds but they dont make me want to go out and socialize, they just make it easier when I'm forced to socialize, like at work or something. Anti depression meds won't help me find a job, won't stop my existenial depression, won't give me a purpose in life. I don't know how to fix myself.

I literally just don’t have the energy to keep trying. Right now my nephew who is the only reason I have lived this long is visiting but after he leaves I just want everything to be over. I can’t live another 37 years like this.	circinia	reply	na	na	na	0.0023336925078183413	no	strong	no	na	depression

I never stopped thinking about what we could have been. I wasn't  the best the whole time, and I know it was too late, but i tried my hardest towards the end. i changed a lot about myself, i think for the better. And broke a lot of bad habits. And i still strive to be better than i was. I had hopes somehow we'd end up back together, but that was just wishful thinking. even through all the bad, the good times stick out the most when remembering you.	circinia	reply	na	na	na	0.0023336925078183413	weak	strong	no	na	depression
"I’m feeling so sad 

I should be happy but I feel so sad. My wife and I are expecting our first child and I am happy about that I can’t wait to meet our little baby. I finally got out of retail which is something I had thought I wanted. Now I’m a custodian at a local High School. It has only been about 3 weeks or this week will be 3 weeks. I feel I made a bad decision. Before I was a full time manager at craft store. Yet if you asked me about 2 months ago I would’ve said I hated it and wanted to do something new. Now I vacuum class rooms all day. Granted this job, despite being a step down is actually a good job. Consistent schedule. Weekends and holidays off. Even get summer and winter off. A total of 182 work days. I make about 3.50 more than I was, and the insurance is better. Yet I miss that hectic schedule I miss having to work most of the time. I miss my days being different. I keep telling myself to give it more time it’s only been 3 weeks but I can’t take it I think I made a mistake. I’m home and all I want to do is go home. Why do I feel this way. I should be so happy.

"Lately it’s felt like I swing back and forth between total and complete apathy about my life situation and complete and utter desperation and sadness.

Like I keep trying to tell myself “so what if you’re not good enough to get the career you’ve always dreamed of? Companies don’t know good talent if it hit them in the butt, besides you shouldn’t worry about things outside of your control.” And I feel fine for a second but then I swing back to “oh my god I would LITERALLY DO ANYTHING if a company offered me a job in this field, it’s what I’ve wanted more than ANYTHING IN THE WHOLE WORLD.”

Like on one hand it’s exhausting having to care so much and it feels like I pretend I wouldn’t give a fuck if I were offered a job in my field, but on the other hand I know I’m so desperate to work in that field if offered the opportunity I would snatch that shit up in an instant."	circinia	reply	na	na	na	0.0023336925078183413	no	strong	no	na	depression
Really not well today, having a rough time dealing with a breakup. Changed my therapist and I think I'll make great progress with her as she seems great though I think it's gonna be a marathon getting through what's in my head and at this moment I'm struggling to cope so many things. I'm starting to unlove myself a little bit more everyday and I've no idea what direction I'm headed in any more. Just feel so lost. I'll head to the gym after work and hopefully that'll give some temporary relief.	circinia	reply	na	na	na	0.0023336925078183413	weak	strong	no	na	depression

"Hello. I'm doing ok. I've been trying to keep myself busy with lifting, guitar, video games, work. It's been a struggle. But I'm doing ok. The first month of the breakup was rough but we still lived together and it felt almost the same. But now that she has moved out, I feel like I'm going through the breakup pains again. She moved out a few weeks ago now. It's better now. But it's still a struggle.

The biggest depressive moment I had lately was my job promotion. On the surface it's great. I feel like it was a recognition and well deserved reward for several years of hard work. But on the other hand, when I got off the meeting, and looked around at the apartment, I realized I was alone. I had no one to celebrate it with.

It was the deepest feeling of depression I've had in a long while. I've done some things to make myself feel like I celebrated. I went out to a café the next day and treated myself to a nice lunch. And just sat there admiring the world from another place. And it was nice. But the lonely feeling was still there.

I realize now that this lonely feeling is something I'm going to have to get used to. It's a feeling like I'm drifting through an empty void. Just bouncing off friends and family with no real comfort or attachments.

But it'll be ok. It always has, and I'm sure it will be."	circinia	reply	na	na	na	0.0023336925078183413	weak	strong	no	na	depression
I just have this profound pulling at me like I’m not supposed to be here. My life is empty of all happiness. I don’t have anyone anymore. Most of my friends have passed and I just feel like I should be wherever that is instead of here. I don’t really care for myself that much and there’s no one I can talk to. I have a career where I am supposed to be highly competent and reliable, but I can’t muster the energy to take basic care of myself. I just want to drift away from here. I’ve never done well on my own and I don’t think I can put up with the constant thoughts and heartache all the time. Everyone needs someone. Everyone needs a reason. I’ve been looking for 21 years and found nothing but people who try to take advantage or put themselves in a position to use me for money. I’m no fool, and I have tried so hard to break this pattern and search for a family. There just isn’t any opportunity for one anymore and I’m getting to the age that it might not matter. I’m very stubborn and haven’t given up on anything in my life. So I find it ironic the one thing I desperately want to give up is life itself. I just don’t want to be alone with these thoughts anymore. It wasn’t always this way I’ve been trying to find my way back but the only way I seem to go is down. I only hope no one else feels this way. Hopefully it doesn’t last this long for them. Half my life I’ve fought this fight and I don’t think I’m going to much longer.	circinia	reply	na	na	na	0.0023336925078183413	no	strong	no	na	depression

It all started as a kid, both of my parents were depressive alcoholics, my mom was the worst part, she screamed like hell late at night when I was just 3 years old, during childhood and teenage years it was the same, I always  thought it's not that bad or thought it could be worse and it's true but it doesn't change that because of this life experience I have huge problems to show affection towards women, the smallest form of rejection makes me depressive, Im now 25, my dad died 2 and a half year ago and it didn't improve my mental state. I feel like Im carrying a heavy bag on my back. My mom put a lot of stones in it and I just can not carry it anymore and I don't know how to take out the stones. Everyone sees my tired face but not the bag I just wish someone could take out some stones, just a few please I beg for it, why is no one helping me, can't they see how weak my legs are, how much my back hurts, please just take out some stones I feel like Im close to colapse, I feel like I will fall down because of the bag every moment, if can't get rid of the back I might just want to get rid of me at least then thr pain stops ...	circinia	reply	na	na	na	0.0023336925078183413	no	strong	no	na	depression

"My therapist quit her job and I am on the waiting list for when another can take a new patient. It feels like I'm back at the starting line to getting better again. It's really freaking discouraging. It's always scary meeting a new therapist, so I am kinda dreading whenever one is available. But I also feel very alone and scared so I want it to happen sooner rather than later.

Everything seems so difficult for some reason and I feel ashamed for it. I'm too depressed to take care of myself most days. I've lost a lot of weight from not eating enough because I'm too depressed to tackle the ordeal of cooking. It's hard to remember to brush my teeth, I probably have cavities. I feel like a worthless lump. The world is hostile and I don't feel like I fit in it anywhere. I'm lost.

I have constant anxiety weighing down on me. It's crushing. So much fear and dread. It's affecting my physical health. I am seeing doctors about the physical stuff, at least. But if the root cause is all the depression and anxiety and other stuff i was diagnosed with, it feels like just a bandaid seeing doctors for the physical symptoms. It feels a little like a waste of effort.

I would feel totally alone if i didn't have my cat. She helps ground me, and if nothing else I can get the will to get up and take care of her. I'm so glad she's here. She keeps me here. She makes me happy. She's the best thing in the world. I want to get better and give her a good long life.

My older sister is the same way and im very shame to call a therapist because im not ready to share the other info i have because i feel embarrassed for being depressed.

"I don't understand this illness.....  


Because that is what this is, or at least I think that's what this is.  
By all measures I have no reason to feel as bad as I do.  


I am successful in my career, bring in more than most I know.  
Have a wife. 3 wonderful children.. Great kids..  


But I still feel like a fraud and a failure.  
And =I know where it stems from. I had horrible siblings and the only parental figure I had I love died when I was young.  My grandparents did their best to support me but they were emotionally disconnected.  Where crying was not done publicly.  


There is a whole sub chapter to that... and there are multiple facets to that that point to my issues.   


By why does every drug they want to put you on make you just feel numb to everything?   
I don't what all my emotions subdued,  I just want to have them feel like they are overcome able.   Instead of a vast void, just a challenge to step forward...  


logically I have NO reason to feel as bad about myself as I do.   And fuck that just makes it worse.  SO many people have is so much worse...

"I know life can be tough. I think that I used to think procrastination is a bad thing. But I think pushing things to ""tomorrow"" isn't always a bad thing. At least I hope so. I know eventually I have to face a problem, big or small. But what can I do about not wanting to do it ""now?"" 

There's always tomorrow. This is a mindset that I don't have a problem with anymore. Or at least less of a problem. For me, it's something that I really dread, to push a task to tomorrow.

 For example, I might need to go to the grocery store, which means I have to get up, get ready, drive there, shop, bag up my stuff, put in the car, drive home, etc. It's a lot of mini-tasks. I can't seem to consolidate these tasks to ""go to the store."" Which is why I think I tend to push things to later. So far, I have gone to the store out of impulse. But it still has been successful overall. So I shouldn't be too hard on myself if I don't get everything done right away.

But I don't know. It feels connected to my depression/anxiety about having to go out. But yeah just wanted post."	circinia	reply	na	na	na	0.0023336925078183413	weak	strong	no	na	depression
"Still not over breaking it off with my ex best friend of 7 years. I still regularly cry about him, and am crying rn over him. It has been almost 2 years since our last messages (and over 2 since i felt like the friendship wasn't there anymore). 

Our one remaining mutual (my only ""friend"" for the past two years, though we barely talk :/) thinks it isn't too late to try and rekindle things. I just think it had deteriorated so much in the span of half a year that i lost all faith i had in my ex best friend. And he has never once asked the mutual to talk to me, or sent a friend request, or emailed or even texted me after we stopped talking. 

To me, it's over for good. But i fucking miss him so much it hurts so bad. He gave me hope and goals for the future - to meet up one day (online friends) and travel the continent together. I can't do it without him. I can't do *this* without him.

Anyway before i make even less sense, [here is my go-to crying song that i feel encompasses my feelings about this situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzWNnsmFGWI).

I just don't know what to do with my life. I wish I had someone to tell me what to do. I feel so confused and get upset over minor decisions, like feeling stressed trying to decide what to eat, what to watch on tv. When it comes to bigger decisions like picking a job, deciding where i want to live in the future (no way I can afford to live where I do now with my parents, if I wanted to move out, I'd have to leave the city). I don't know what I should working towards. There's nothing I really want out of life. I feel empty and lost. I feel like a waste of space but that I could be useful if someone just gave me some direction. Almost kinda wish I had joined the army. My father threatened to put me in military school after high school but my mother resisted. God, I wish they had sent me back then. I feel so alone, like an alien, I don't relate to anyone around me and I don't understand what makes humans tick. I don't want to be here. I have no way to make money, there's no jobs anywhere where I live. All the standard retail/cashier jobs are being replaced by tablets, I never see opening for warehouses anymore. I'm not qualified for office work because I have no experience and don't know how to get any. I don't even know what field to pursue because AI is about to disrupt everything.

My job stopped scheduling me and my manager stopped texting me back, so I have no way to save for a car. I tried applying at everywhere possible, but suddenly no one is hiring now. I got into an argument with my dad after telling him how hopeless i’ve been feeling because he said it’s just because I have no ambition. I didn’t even wish him a happy father’s day. I spend my days on the couch watching one movie after the next and at night I cry until I fall asleep. My friends make plans with me and then cancel, making me feel so much worse because it’s like I’m trapped here in my house with nothing to do. My boyfriend is such a sweetheart and he doesn’t deserve having to deal with my mood swings and sadness and i’m so grateful for him, but he just doesn’t understand.

I hate sharing; I really do, but this is just one of those times. I Just got out of the marine Corps a few months ago. I moved to a state with no friends, no family, and a fresh start. Yet getting past this loneliness is hard. Every day I start the day off strong and full of hope, yet by the end I feel alone. That's not even the worst part; I have a huge crush on YouTuber Brett Cooper. Maybe it's the fact she and I share a lot of the same values, which I never had a partner that did; my last girlfriend was really liberal and the one before was incredibly abusive. I guess I don't have a crush exactly on Brett but i would love to have some one like her but that's the next problem girls like her don't like guys like me. I'm a huge gaming nerd atheist and always joke around and never series. I grew up in the country so I understand why I like girls like here but I don't ever attract girls like here and it sucks I don't even attract male guys like me (as in friends) so I don't bother in making friends or dating anymore lately I don't even bother getting out of bed only for work god I'm a loser.	circinia	reply	na	na	na	0.0023336925078183413	no	strong	no	na	depression

I've decided to try to live with this feeling for now. Maybe it'll be easier to accept it then try to pretend I'm okay or try to distract myself from the hurt. Kind of a first slightly optimistic post from me. I know I'm still going to wake up feeling empty and wanting to die but at this moment I've come to accept that I still love him and I don't want to be ashamed of loving someone. Even tho it's fucking pathetic to love someone who has used me and hurt me so many times. The upside is that at least I am capable of love. I'm just tired of being so damn miserable. I need to become someone that he regrets losing one day. Hopefully.

It is really ironic that I have to be put on birth control to take some meds when I cannot physically have sex. I'm broken. Physically and mentally.

"I'd like to think the last however many months have been an upswing but realistically I think it's mostly that I haven't been working (getting away with it mostly by eating through savings + living with my parents rather than paying rent), and in reality I'm just sort of numbed in a way that I wasn't when I was working. While working the cycles of anxiety and panic attacks mixed with the depression kept me very aware of my bad mental state; unemployed, I'm instead able to just sort of go through the routine of things, set a bunch of short-term goals that aren't really goals at all and are instead just minor things you would do in the normal course of your life (fix x! see doctor about y!) except because I'm functionally a NEET, I treat these as huge life obstacles and tell myself I'll try to apply to jobs after I get past them. And then I set up a new obstacle as an excuse to continue sleeping way too long, playing video games that don't actually seem to feel fun at all, and doing whatever else I can to hide from my own thoughts.

While mostly I think I'm ""better"" than I was two years ago because I'm simply not working anymore, I think the antidepressant is definitely playing a role for me in that I am less likely to dream about, yknow, ending it. Though today is not one of those days where I'm not dreaming about it. Should probably find a therapist to try and make some actual progress in my life, but even the desire to actually get better is so distant and fragile. The easiest thing to do is just stay in my present state until I waste away into nothingness or get hit by a bus (accidentally!) or something."	circinia	reply	na	na	na	0.0023336925078183413	no	strong	no	na	depression
"There are no words I can type that can express my massive disappointment with this life.

Years upon years upon years of hell. No relief. No bright light.

Even the few things in this world that could bring me joy are twisted to be sources of misery themselves.

I want to detach. I'm so consumed with apathy that I don't even feel the richness of the fantasies of dying. I just want to shut down. Turn off. Sleep and be at peace.

I don't care if it sounds arrogant. If the people around me lived my life, they would've all blown their brains out or dangled their bodies from their necks by now. I can see it in the jarred, uncomfortable expressions on their faces when I let them know a fraction of my life. Most just stand there, a mix of uncaring and incomprehension.

I had so many dreams. There were late afternoons I danced in front of the brilliant setting sun, so full of hope. I just knew when I got over the horizon, things would be so much better. That the long nights in lonely near-silence, trying to smother my weeping so no one else would hear, would be a thing of the past.

Who knew that calamity after calamity would follow. Death by a thousands cuts. Some cuts more like massive wounds, others small but numerously overwhelming. 

Was it my fault for wanting so much? I used to dream of living in a home with my love, and we would be in love and likewise love our community, and we would have friends abound and be full of life. 

Now? 

Now, I can barely stand living with myself. My ex almost-wife a tragically twisted parody of my dream, turning dreams to nightmares. The city I dreamed of denigrated into despair. The friends I dreamt of remaining just that- dreams.

I should just fucking do the deed to get this fucking bullshit over with. I sometimes start cackling madly in the midst of breaking down because my mind jokes instinctively that this can't possibly get any fucking worse. But haha, it gets worse every single second. Every day I spend alive, my life gets worse. 

I am there for others when they are seeking to kill themselves. I am at their side, pleading for life and letting them know they're loved.

Nobody would do that for me. They don't care. THEY FUCKING DON'T. I'M FUCKING TRAPPED. I should just fucking

I tried too. That's what makes it all the more macabre. A ""paragon"" of humanity. Strong, fast, well-learned and studied, generous to a fault. Yes, I have more ugliness and faults than most, but I always hid them well. I know I am of value. And yet, I am nearly cut down in defeat. Humanity gapes in grotesque horror as a guardian of others is guided to his death by overwhelming defeatism, wrought from defeat after defeat after defeat.

Everytime I post here, I have a rebound. An uplifting force where I cry havoc and let slip my determined fury to live. Each time, with the passing of time, it gets weaker, and weaker, and weaker.

I know one day I will walk in fields of gold. Many years will have passed since those summer days where I ran and danced as the sun went down. I know when my life slips away, finally, and I am freed of this worldly agony, my mind will fade back to when I walked in fields of gold."	circinia	reply	na	na	na	0.0023336925078183413	no	strong	no	na	depression
"Normally sleep would help. To wake up with existential dread is not the best way to start a day. I can feel the heaviness on my chest and in my stomach. 

Am I in fear? Totally. Is there anything you can do to prevent the statistically highly possible? I don’t know how am I supposed to know? I’m not sure anger would help here either. The person who’s filled with rage is the first to get burned (in hell.) 

What can I say? That it’s normal for your grieving process to vacillate among different emotional states. Not giving your feelings too much weight lest they would cloud your judgment aside, feelings are there first and foremost to tell you something. The child might be having unreasonable fear by the standard of an an adult, or it could be an actual valid concern of theirs. At any rate, would you forcefully tell the worried child to fuck off instead of assuring them that they are heard, working together for a solution and teaching them/reinforcing healthy coping mechanisms? I hope the answer is clear.

Still, I refuse to label the unknown future. Keep doing what I can and resign to fate when it comes to it. Be steadfast in my practice. At least in the letting-go-of-myself department. It’s a relief because even if this moment were my last, I wouldn’t have any regret. No regret of what I should have done, what I should not have done, what I wanted to do, what I should do. Isn’t it funny and insightful that in this thought experiment you don’t regret you didn’t have more? Stuff, experience, people, yourself. Gone with the wind.

"It feels like I'm trapped in a rut that I can never escape from. I have severe depression, little connection with any of my friends, take terrible care of my hygiene, and I hate my parents. My parents constantly gaslight me and are terrible human beings who constantly voice out their horrific beliefs that they don't know are basically targeted at me. I feel so much hatred every time I pretend to love them, pretend that I'm happy being near them, pretend I'm happy as they constantly attempt to take the only time that gives me a sliver of what I consider ""happiness"" to be. I constantly sit there and listen as they say that something is wrong with me, or as my mom says she'll force me to a therapist if I don't talk or communicate with a random stranger I've never known. I constantly hate myself and feel like a fake, believing that I'm faking my emotions to get a reaction or attention from others. I feel disgusted every day that I don't brush my teeth or shower, and I feel like a freak every time I hear people talk about how disgusting that behavior is. I feel like a fake when I hear all those posts talk about how it's the people who're happy on the outside that suffer the most. I feel invalidated and feel that nobody will ever take my feelings seriously just because I'm not like that stereotype. Of course, most people around me won't even realize something is wrong unless you clearly say you have depression, and everybody jokes about it, so why would anybody care about me who is OBVIOUSLY just going along with it. I feel like I've spent my entire life researching ways to get better, from why someone might have depression and into the pros and cons of antidepressants. I really don't understand myself. I don't even feel like a human being anymore. How could I possibly be a normal human in a world where people are so focused on goals and happiness and the future? How is everybody planning on a stage of life that I don't even plan on making it to? How is my entire life spent on attempts to understand what's wrong with me while they're all worried about what college they want to go to?

I will lose my fucking mind without a purpose. I feel like I have so much to give, so much to offer. But I've been so burnt out with every fresh start I try to make. My biggest fear is that there is nothing out there for me. Nothing that will bring back my life and drive and ambition. So often I wish I had never existed, because what existence is this? I can't remember a time when I wasn't battling depression or anxiety. It's always just a push for one more week, one more year, to be back where I was. I need a break, that's clear and obvious.

I was just going to drop some stuff off for her from her parents but we ended up walking around just talking for an hour. I felt happy. Then I let her know I lost the thing I was supposed to deliver from her parents and bought a replacement. I think she got mad but rather than argue she just didn't see the point. I asked if she wanted to see the Perseids and she said nothing. Silent treatment isn't right. I think I'm done.  

Going out to meet some people for Barbie and dinner tonight. I was going to go to a bar with people but my brother won't drive me to the station so I'll just drive myself. The bar thing might be cancelled anyways. I'd like to meet someone else but I also don't want to stay near my parents. They've proven that they like to sabotage my happiness.

I uninstalled a game I was using to escape for a bit. But now I just end up sleeping too much or lay in bed. I really just wanted to get drunk, maybe meet someone new.

"Feel quite depressed today and physically exhausted. My coworker invited me to her birthday party today, and while that meant a lot to me, I didn't go.

The past few weeks have been overwhelming. Friend visited, family visited, moved apartments, been to good concerts, started seeing a new FWB, started seeing a new possible romantic interest. In a lot of regards, my life is going great. But I still feel numb to the pleasure from time to time. It feels like a lot in a short period of time. I'm tired. I'm overwhelmed. I feel lonely in spite of all my close connections.

And it's funny, when I don't do any of these things, I get bored easily. It's like my brain is wired to gain pleasure and seek social activity half time, but then when I do that, I can't handle too much of it. But then when I stop, I crave it again knowing I don't have much in the battery for it.

"I'm so torn on what to do about treatment. Yes I know I probably should be on medication. I just really don't want to be on shit like SSRIs. Like I get it, they help people, and I have absolutely nothing bad to say to people on them. I'm just terrified of being so dependent on medication. I'm on lamotrigine and wellbutrin, but I'm getting off of the wellbutrin (I'm tapering off over the course of the next few weeks). The lamotrigine is fine. I just want to drop that dose a little bit because 200mg makes me nauseous. I feel like lamotrigine had kept me stable for the most part. Yeah I still get depressed and I still have my upward swings but they're no where near as bad.

SSRIs are a type of medication I've heard very different things on. Some say they're great, others say they felt lifeless while on them. And some people have long lasting effects.  My biggest issue is my anxiety, more so than my depression since my anxiety causes me to get more and more depressed.

All this just keeps bouncing around my head and I don't know what to do because I don't want to make things worse for myself. 


I'm in therapy and I feel like that's more important than any medication. As long as I stay stable and continue with lighter types of medication I should be fine. Idk I'm just torn and I keep going back and forth on my stance of medication.

Thankfully my psychiatrist isn't some pill pusher so she's letting me make my own decision and do research alongside the information she tells me.


I guess it's just my anxiety not letting me think clearly."	circinia	reply	na	na	na	0.0023336925078183413	no	strong	no	na	depression
Low-key depressed. Too subtle to notice at first glance. Not sure about anything. Proof that (certain) emotional states didn’t magically go away. Why should they do anyway? All you can do is becoming better at observing them, catching them “red-handed” as soon as possible. Don’t get me wrong I’m not saying you should judge your emotions. Keep watching them. Let them take up whatever imaginary shape or volume necessary, instead of granting them material existence. The balloons are bound to deflate over time, eventually. Honestly this is what I find to be one of the most beautiful and comforting things about life. And let’s say there are emotional states that are perfect opposites of depressed, sad, and negative. It’s not even safe to encourage them to roam around without check. Finally, how to know that you’re being neutral or just plain old apathetic?

I'm stuck in a emotionaless hollowness cycle.  Everything honestly seems pointless, and or fake. We live in a world where everything has been done before, and where 90% of things are artificial. I could work so hard to achieve something but in the end if my adhd even allows me to finish something/ achieve something what is the point in the large scheme of things? I've completely stoped caring about what others think of me- which was supposed to be a great thing.... But now that I don't care what people think about me and “I love myself/ comfortable in who I am” ( my mindset… but how true that is idk, I’ve just said it to myself so much it’s what I believe now) I have no drive to do anything out of my basic 9-5.  I am a single mom, with no friends or even a sense of social life away from my mom and random cashiers. I went through back to back to back to back trauma in 2017, and began isolation habits, and by the time Covid hit I was basically already self isolated, and when covid lockdowns ended I just never stopped. I have no clue how to even hold on to the desire to be social and have friends; long enough to even have a single fluid conversation. Im stuck. And I’m going no where. And I’m just…. Broken. It’s not like I’m running around melodramatic…. I seem happy and bubbly enough…. I just can’t seem to find any worth in most things. I keep going around forcing a positive mindset for my son…. But in the truth of things I’m just hollow. Going through the bare minimum motions to keep the days going.  I feel like I’m perpetually  waiting. As though when this life ends I get to try again. Like this one needs to go into the waste basket, and just around the corner is a reset button to a brand new life. I feel like I’m in limbo, just waiting to start anew. I know that’s not how it works unless you believe in recarnation ….. and I’m not sure how I even got to this mindset but I realized it a few days ago. I’m in constant waiting mode. Like I’m reading a subpar book, but once I finish this one I get to go to the second in the series  that I just know will be so good.  I don’t know how to get myself to realize that THIS is my life. And that I am wasting the time I have. I don’t know how to reteach myself what joy and happiness is. It all just seems like allot of effort for something that’s not going to matter . Im not talented enough, or able to focus enough to do anything that is going to be noteable when I’m gone. I’ve decided to just focus on always being kind to others in the rare situations I talk to someone… and try to help my son know he is loved and amazing….. but as for me? I just don’t know.	circinia	reply	na	na	na	0.0023336925078183413	no	strong	no	na	depression

I told her and she screamed at me, I understand she’s frustrated cuz she doesn’t know how to help, but she said I make my mental health worse.

"I'm sorry to hear about that, I know how bad it feels to lose a source of income. But from the looks of things, you seem to have some form of stability, or at least a roof over your head to lay around under, so it's not the end of the world! (Yet).

You are down on your luck, It's difficult to get up and face the world, but no one said you had to conquer it in a single day, what you need to do now is take little steps. Stop punishing yourself for not working out. If you really want to do some exercise, put the phone down and do 5 pushups right now. That was really quick, right? Doing 5 more next time you randomly decide to do 5 pushups will be a minute of your time at most.

I have no idea what your job was or what level in your career you're at, but you can take little steps to improve that, too! Werther, it's a portfolio, a CV that needs polishing up, work on that little by little, make phone calls, and send in those applications.

"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them."

Biggest Problem on private talks may be that you may reach a point where you're out of advice for the one who needs help and then what ? just leave the chat ? - that would even make it worse for both of you.

"I have to agree with this. I know that people mean well but sometimes it’s better to let the person vent and make that person feel understood instead of trying to change that person and make him/her happier. 

I feel that forced positivity has a worse effect on me than sad posts. It’s hard for people without mental illnesses to understand that.

"Great rule! I’ve never thought about things you said but you made some great points.   
  
And even as I didn’t think about it I still felt like this type of comments were unnecessary. Like most of them aren’t ready to commit to having a thoughtful conversation but they comment anyway.  
  
It is also very hard for a person who struggles with depression to initiate a conversation. “PM me anytime” isn’t an initiation. OP should write the first PM which is very hard as many would feel like they are bothering the commenter are that they don’t deserve the time and attention.  
  
It would only make sense if people first made a comment about OP’s situation or thoughts, ask some questions and only then end their message with “PM me if you want to answer privately”. Now OP won’t feel bad for PM-ing someone because the commenter asked them a question so OP doesn’t initiate a conversation — it has already been initiated. As you said, it’s better not to offer to PM and as it’s a rule now nobody should do it — I’m just saying that this was one of the reasons to implement the rule so if someone is commenting on another similar subreddit (where “PM me” is allowed) try to write more than that, ask questions and discuss the topic before you offer to PM.  
  
Also seeing the same, standardized answers (even if some important meaning is hiding behind them) may make you feel really bad both as an OP or as a lurker. It makes you feel like nobody really cares about strangers’ problems."	SQLwitch	reply	na	na	na	0.9929254055023193	weak	strong	no	na	depression
"Thank you for posting this.... as much as I want to have a more personal connection with people here, I realize how that pre-disposes OP's to VERY bad advice and people who are suffering are often in an altered state that DOES NOT benefit others.

"I really appreciate this post! 

As someone who's posted here, I've received a few PMs that started off with the usual: ""Hey, how are you? I felt like you needed to talk to someone.""

I really appreciated the sentiment, but it felt like a forced interaction. Not without care or consideration, but catered specifically to be a body to talk to and knowing the intention behind it, ironically made me feel obligated to politely respond, but pussyfooted (for a lack of a better word) in my attitude. 

This is only because I know it's a sincere, but more importantly, an instantly sympathetic reaction to a sad post. It's not something I expect to be a meaningful, lasting relationship, but one born for a moment out of immediate sympathy. Like a hand on the shoulder. 

I do appreciate them. I really do, but I also can do without it, and like the moderators here have said, comments are all I need. Commiserating, advice for me or anybody relating to the OP, or a simple upvote to show support is really all I'm looking for. If a meaningful online interaction \*naturally\* precipitates, I'm all for it. I hope I'm not being too sensitive, but hey...

"I’m guilty of doing this and, as others have pointed out, it has always been out of goodwill but it is too unpredictable and therefore dangerous. Especially earlier this year when I started therapy and found this sub I wanted to feel better and helping others or the though of helping others aided me in that; 
I fell into the “I want to feel helpful” category despite my best intentions.

I did end up having a private conversation with someone, helping them as best I could, as often as I could and it started of pretty good no matter the time or topic. However, a couple days in I was out of advice and at a low point myself. The conversations came to a screeching halt - they couldn’t help me and I couldn’t help them. Their issues had transformed into (or had always been about) something entirely different than their original post posited and I turned into a helpee myself instead of a helper. We both went our separate ways none the better. 

After that I never replied regarding dm’s and kept it to comment chains only.

"I agree ""pm me anytime"" is useless, imo if someone was that concerned, drop them a message not with a ""I'm here to help message me anytime"" but ask them what's up, people don't want to ask for help, especially in cases like this where someone's depression might feel silly even though it's not, I'm not sure on how much harm would come of it but possibly just being direct and making the person talk about it, starting with the concerning person might possibly be the way to do it"	SQLwitch	reply	na	na	na	0.9929254055023193	weak	no	no	na	depression

"Here’s my story and experience with this- I posted on SW a long time ago and was targeted by a much older man (I was an 18 y/o girl) preying on vulnerable women. He offered to PM me and abused that. He first emotionally distanced me from my friends in the real world so I only relied on him for support. This is how he was able to make me codependent on him and would put up with other things so he could get what he wanted. 

He convinced me I had a serious mental illness so I questioned my sanity so when he made stepped over a boundary I was just being “crazy”. He worked for the NCA. He told me he could “find me easily”. He got my personal details. I was terrified one day he would turn up at my house. 

A couple of other things happened, I eventually went to his work and had to give a statement. I’m pretty sure he lost his job for talking to me at work and abusing his power to manipulate a mentally ill teenager. I had to sit in a room with a bunch of two way mirrors and hidden cameras and talk about everything. They screened my laptop. I don’t know if my video was used in court I kind of left it all behind after that. 

But anyway. All this came from one PM. You should never trust a random stranger not everyone is just looking out for you and wants to talk."	SQLwitch	reply	na	na	na	0.9929254055023193	no	strong	no	na	depression
"I personally don't come here looking for helpers or to become a helper for other people. I'm mostly looking for people I can feel more connected to, for whom I can feel true empathy. And if I could make friends that would be very nice but I know that's not easy.

I don't know about the others but the whole 'relationship with the institution' thing is a huge part of the reason I personally don't like help lines. It's like we're supposed to talk to NPCs. Just like therapists (who I see as helpful tools rather than people who care about me. Well at least help lines do their thing for free.

Not trying to question the rules or anything just expressing how I feel about this.

"Yes, this is a very sensible sticky in my opinion.

I have been on both sides of this coin. As a ""helper"", I find that I didn't really help the person via a more live chatting or back and forth messaging. Posting a few replies on the person's thread and boosting them up is fine, but you it's just a whole new ballgame to try and be the person's friend/advisor.

As a helpee, I've found myself disappointed as the person (understandably) just seemed like they didn't actually care all that much with their proposal, and even if they did, it's just not what I was seeking (which is not their fault obviously!).

So yeah, in a way it might even worsen things sometimes. I'm all for support, but I think that it's actually best to just keep it on the thread."	SQLwitch	reply	na	na	na	0.9929254055023193	no	strong	no	na	depression

"> **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP.** 

This is sort of counterproductive though. Most of the time, help isn't generalized, it's personalized by nature. Not everyone's depression look the same, some advice can trigger anxiety in others while it can be a wake-up call to some.   


Generally a common way of dealing with depression from a CBT perspective is things like training mindfulness and practicing it often. But this is extremely hard for people with diagnoses like ADD, ADHD to get a working routine on, I'm not saying to defend the ""PM you anytime"" but reddit is a horrendously bad forum to help people quickly, often people get replies during a week's period and some form of support group for this type of struggle, not when people are suicidal low, but still depressed enough to make it hinder their lives can be helped if we could setup some form of group chat to remind each other or give ideas of how to deal with certain situations. A lot of times people know what they need to do, but hearing someone else tell them to do it will be of great importance."	SQLwitch	reply	na	na	na	0.9929254055023193	no	no	no	na	depression

This is the reason why I use large chat groups. Even with those who have been trained in supporting ppl,I feel they might get too drained out.

So on Twitter, I’ve expressed my woes before and the DMs I got weren’t really assuring. I get that people mean well but pep talks don’t really help. Because even though they mean well, it comes off as, “Hey, you’re a freak.

I think I get it. It makes sense since I've helped people through difficult situations through private chats, and it can be extremely distressing when the person you're trying to help is suicidal.

"Rules broken and fixed, but though i might share some point of view mod.

In the info section it's mentioned that helper can write in comment if their intention is positive, yet for some they are shy to post in public but they want to share their experience so they might opt to PM.

Although i understand that this rules is to prevent consequences, i am just sharing a view so that PMs are not so negatively viewed.

Although again yes, positive PMs might result in getting the OPs hopes up and gullible for bad-intentioned PMs, but i think i just need to share this.

"*Let Me Add My Thoughts with this, I've  must confess I didn't  read the whole post* (or the wiki, wanna check it out later, full focused  in it, I'm  kinda busy rn xp, I promise)  *and I will appreciate  greatly all kinds of feedbacks you all would like to give me. Well, with your permission:

I've suffered depression/been depressed since I was around 10 yo until this year's  February (2019).
(Major depressive disorder, severe depression, you name it. The first  condition it's only a raw translation from my native language to English, although it may be different as the actual English name, sorry if I've made a mistake)

I don't  want to offend anyone here or make this condition appear to be worse than it really is, but for me, it was Hell. Perhaps I'm  lacking the proper words to describe it but for me it feels/felt like that.
Around the same age ( I've  started  my toxic relationship with depression) I've  developed anxiety disorder, I'm  still struggling/fighting against that B****.  A nasty combo.

For some reason unknown, even for myself, in some moment in that time I've started to think about both conditions as females, ladies, nothing against them obviously, they are more beautiful than men,  proved they are more intelligent than men and without the ladies we are just savages, love them all. Xp 

Now, as an adult (25 years old, male) I've took a phrase for myself, it says, more or less:

""Depression is nothing more than a sad lady knocking at our door in a rainy night. Let her in and listen carefully what she has to say, but do not let her stay. Once the rain has stopped, say goodbye to her.
Otherwise, she *Will* get into every corner of your house( Inner me, mind, etc), and kicking her out it's hard, painful and takes lots of time, wasting life. You don't  have to be rude, though, learn how to treat her, listening her words and advising her are the best way to help her and yourself. Letting her stay and being rude will start  a war between both of you, a nasty one, and in the beginning, she is always stronger than us. 
Takes years to overpower her and acquire control.
 Listen the echoes inside of you, the voice around you and read the words dedicated to you. It may be someone nice trying to be nice with themselves or he/she could be someone struggling too, trying to make you know that there's others with their own wars, some of em had lost some battles, others had won, but all of em are fighting back, see them and learn from them. A few others have lost the will to fight and this lady took their heart, alongside their last breath. I never forget them, it could have been me.
There's stairs to heaven, highways to hell and the unlimited potential we all have to evolve, let me tell you my secret ;) :you seek outside the reasons, help, strength or anything you think you need to not give up. You NEED to go and look inside, think about  it. We are amazed by the wonders in the space, maybe because we already forget the beauty of the jewels in the deeps of the planet. That's the hint. 
I'm fool and forget to mention another possibility: if the written words were made for your eyes, the voices for your eyes, or the cheers for your heart, it could be a type of people I admire, respect and decided to become one of them in the future: The friends beyond all the fight. Because you'll find a friend in almost every one of them. And they will be one (or both) of two things: and adviser/helper, like masters, to share with you where they did stumble in their path and suggest useful things.
Or your friends, doing the same as the first, and even more, much more.
They've learned to appreciate anything that shines in the darkness after living there for so long that they don't  want anybody to feel the same, and if you let me include myself with them, we will do such things because we like it, and we mean it. 
I am or I am not. Always. I'm always Too much of anything or absolutely nothing,  There's no mid points to me, I pour my soul in every thing I've decide to do, always help to anyone I can, serve the others and do good recklessly. That's one thing or two I believe in.
So, c'mon Bro, grab this hand I didn't had and take the strength I've lacked. Anytime you want, mate. That's why I'm here for.""
                                                                                                         The mind of Sun

That's a little thingy I wrote not so long ago, I've felt it would be nice posting it here,  it's  not the complete thing, it has some holes intentionally, but it's the first 80% of my own writings I've post ever. Hope it doesn't offend anyone, if it do not help you by any means, hopefully don't  hurt anyone either. I like to write, you know, my poison  of choice are poetry and philosophy  (damned poetry 😂),
And if you catch even the tiniest bit of the deep meaning it also have, you already figured it wasn't a cute this half of my life. Lived in the bottom for years, pretended to be fine bc like we all do, I didn't want to worry not even one of my love ones, I was unable to have a treatment with a psychologist or psychoanalyst, and my whole list of sins didn't help much either.
I've even tried to ""end"" myself  (sorry for this) four times.
Obviously, fortunately, unsuccessfully. 
After I've surpassed, the very first day after, for the first time in years, I've  woke up, happy. I don't  remembered the last time it happened. A couple of weeks after I've decided to believe in the things I've mentioned in my poor writing above, among others. And even more in those in the last two lines.
I didn't had anybody to help me. Support me, freaking avoid I've tried those 4 things.
I'm not fully recovered, I believe  this lady never really leave, it's always lurking but nice you won her, it's  more hard for her to regain full control. I've decided to always go beyond if I find myself a limit for anything, return anything good people do or give to me 10x  times better, if it was something bad, I'd return them something 100x better, don't  be cruel, don't lose yourself, do not treat people as bad as they are, treat them as good as you are.

Many people here would probably know what cost me to learn these things too. 
That's why I wanna help and give my full disposition when I've reply something similar.
Regardless I do like to know all kinds people.
Although I don't think of myself like a hero or anything.
I'm trying to save pain to people that haven't reach that point, help the ones there, and for all the people struggling I'm  saying: I'm here for you, if you want. Just say the word.
I don't start a chat, perhaps because I would be acting for my own selfishness at first glance.
It's  the way I respect people's desires. 
Although, I know how hard it is. 


THAT'S IT, I'VE EXTENDED MYSELF QUITE MUCH.
MY APOLOGIES HOMIES.
I ASK YOU ALL TO FORGIVE MY GRAMMAR, I'M NOT A NATIVE ENG SPEAKER, LEARNED IT BY MYSELF, STILL POLISHING IT, I'M DOING MY BEST. 
THE WRITING IT'S OBVIOUSLY PHRASES I'VE READ AND LIKED, MIXED WITH MY OWN THOUGHTS.
I USE THESE QUOTE TO SYNTHESIZE MY OWN THOUGHTS/WRITINGS.
I'm still a bit embarrassed for it.
Let me quote a hero:
""Whenever you suffer pain, keep in mind that it’s nothing to be ashamed of and that it can’t degrade your guiding intelligence, nor keep it from acting rationally and for the common good""

""My relationship to them. That we came into the world for the sake of one another.""
      MARCUS AURELIUS 

You are more than you think, stronger than you feel, loved than you believe and unique than you perceive.
Seek something you like or care about, make it a hobby. And do it relentlessly. 

Things like mindfulness, stoicism, a essay/book of a subject you like, even slightly interested in, are helpful too.  Learn more things, do more things.
Once you realize what's stopping you, bringing you down, you'll gain power over it and it will get weaker and weaker. 
You are far more than you think.
I believe that, soon you'll  do it too.

Regardless the feedback you guys give me, I'm  here.  Keep that in mind.
Why not? ;)

Good vibes homies ✌✌✌😎
I send you all a Bro hug. 
You can.

"I'm sorry I'm very late to this topic but I agree entirely. 

I appreciate the intentions may be good, but from previous experiences there are times when the conversation reaches a natural end - but the other person simply won't stop responding. I've had three definite experiences of this in the past where after a few messages back and fourth, I just want to be left alone and continue. I don't want to remain in private contact but there's no polite way of putting this across to the other person. 

Prior to my time on Reddit, there was one particular forum I was a member of who private messaged me for many months. Probably getting on for a year. In the end, I just had to stop replying and inevitably ended up blocking that person when they continued to message me for weeks afterwards - turning quite nasty. 

As my own personal rule, I don't and haven't responded to any private messages for around a year. I don't mean to offend anyone by that but after several 'less than pleasant' experiences and then the expectation to remain in contact thereafter - I've just had to call it a day and say ""*enough's enough*"".

"It sucks, but I 100% agree with this rule. Both as someone who on other social media platforms have tried to help others and have tried to rely on people online to help through a tough time.

The crux of the issue I found is, you don’t know who you are helping. You don’t know them well enough to give that deep, personal, supportive advice they may be aching for.
As well as, being a counselor for free, though honorable, can weigh you down when dealing some people who have hours that don’t work for you or have heavier topics than you were planning and needing the help; especially if you don’t know the person well enough to know how being late, busy, or not being able to properly help an incredibly heavy topic is going to be perceived.
As was said, it also makes the receiver of the help very open to manipulation.

My own life has taught me that the best way to help people is to steer them towards counseling and genuine help that can be in their own life for them, or... if you feel the need to and the infinite patience, discipline, and love required, to genuinely change your life to help another person and be a part of their life.

I’m not saying don’t help anyone unless you can do that; but setting boundaries and clearing up expectations are incredibly important with helping!

But as I said, you don’t know who you are helping and they don’t know you.
And if you aren’t trained on how to protect yourself and the other person from that; sometimes helping people online can end up negatively for both parties.
Accusations, things taken personal, personal issues, energy levels, reading a situation properly; hard to do if not impossible over text platforms.

My private message asked the inquire's age up front with the statement I'd not tell all the facts of my story to a minor. They were 14 so ""apologized"" for asking... From my history, NOT my intent to belittle or dismiss any child/young person who might be struggling with similar historical casual agents & stated that.

In addition to what /u/circinia has so wisely pointed out, there's another reason why it's a sign that's something's seriously wrong if you have trouble remembering this rule.  

If you're really thinking about others' experience, then knowing how getting them into a PM conversation is likely to turn out should make a huge impression on you.  If it hasn't, then maybe you need to ask yourself whether you're responding to others here for the right reasons.  Sometimes when ""we want to help"", what it means is that ""we want to feel helpful"".  ""PM me any time"" is an easy way to make ourselves feel helpful, but if you really think about what the other person's experience, it feels completely different."

"It's always difficult (and worrying) when someone gets attached to a resource or individual that just isn't able to provide the right support.

It can happen for other reasons too, and no mattter how it comes about, the end result is that they are convinced that ""only X can help me"" and also that ""X has what I need"", both of which are almost always untrue.  This happens all too often even when nobody creates unrealistic expectations or makes - or at least implies - impossible promises  - but ""PM me anytime"" does both those things.

One of the most difficult training issues at my agency is helping new responders set boundaries with people in crisis.  But it's absolutely necessary - maybe more necessary than with people *not* in crisis.  We harm people by *not* disrupting their unrealistic expectations that can never be met.  We also harm people when we try to give them what we simply haven't got.

For the people I've had experience with, I've found that this usually doesn't mean they want to talk indeterminately so much so as finish some topic without being abstract about it.

Now when you offer somebody the option of just chatting, that can be pretty indeterminate. You pretty much *can't* do both that and be an active member of this subreddit.

Personally, I think that humans defy generalisation.  I don't think that people are basically good or bad.  I think we differ greatly under the surface.  

There are plenty of psychopaths that basically have a predatory relationship with the rest of their own species, and only the least-successful of them end up in the penal system.  

There are also plenty of people who will find a way to be decent and kind and useful, and to make the world a better place, no matter how badly the world has treated them.

But I think most people are somewhere in between, and whether they end up being a net negative or a net positive in the world depends on their experience.  And, right now, in the ""developed"" world, I don't think most of us have done a particularly good job at building a society that brings out the best in most of its citizens.

“Feel better” is something created by man to relieve the natural problem of existence. The Buddhists toss this silly idea out. Jesus never TRIED to feel better. He never judged or resisted the problems of mankind. The more you try, the more you will fail. The more you will suffer. But do not not-try either, that’s called being passive and giving in. There’s a balance of thinking only when it it becomes necessary and action when it becomes necessary. Ignore all this societies nonsense about a “better-you”. Pain is natural and the other part of any pleasure one can experience. If you win a game, others lose… when you feel cold it’s only because you have felt warmer before. Got to experience the bad if you ever want to experience the good; don’t have to feel bad about yourself. You are just an image created by others tossed onto you. You are nothing but a body with  a conscience, feeling the pains and pleasures of existence.	PermissionHot7174	reply	na	na	na	0.9987454414367676	no	no	no	na	depression

Put it off. I was a little younger when I tried. Then somewhat older when I tried again. I kept putting it off every time after that up to now. Do whatever you have to! See another counselor, take different meds (I had to do both but waited way too long to do so). There are lots of people who feel the same way.. it is hard to believe, I know I didn’t, but it is true. I was feeling as low as you are about a week ago and had a Dr appointment today with a new doctor. They saw I had depression in my chart and asked a lot of uncomfortable questions. The nurse saw I was hesitant and kind of whispered “please be honest.. I have some of the same issues.” I felt a weight lift even though I have lived with these feelings since 4th grade and I am now.. well.. old. At least twice your age. People say that if you end your life it shifts the pain to the people you leave behind. I don’t believe this myself but I can see it in others. THAT is the lie depression tells you. It will find a little truth then blow it up to make you think it is the truth. I takes to the nurse a little and I said it is so strange how this happens. I just met her and felt so bad for her and what she goes through even though I look at myself for being a weak, no self esteem looser. I’m probably not but right now my brain begs to differ. So please put the plans away.. listen to some music that makes you happy, watch a movie that makes you laugh or look at some pictures of some times when you did happy stuff.  This works for me.. I have a playlist that’s called “first aid” that makes me feel better about 99% of the time.  The 1% is when I go to ice cream and that goofy movie “Ted”. With the 🧸 that parties. Oh, the other thing is I am a big Star Wars and Marvel movie fan so I HAVE see what comes out next especially Deadpool 3. I have to stay around for DP3.

Forget the hope of anyone to help you, of course there are people that do care. But, you need to find the power in yourself to keep on going. And sometimes that's in the little things. In the morning, step outside and just look at the sky. Just watch it, watch the clouds, absorb the solar rays, listen to the birds. Hopefully you are in an area you have access to this. Then close your eyes and just think of all the things you'll miss out on if you ended yourself today. I was very suicidal too back in my 20s. And sure life brought hardships too along the way but boy I saw some amazing places in this beautiful planet. Things I never ever dreamed about. Ice crystals suspended in the air looking like glitter in a freezing cold day in ND, the sound of the waves of Northern CA coast, the reflection of street lights off of the beautiful blond hair of this guy in MN I kissed under the snow flakes, standing on the edge of a canyon in Northern Arizona; you can live all that too!

"As someone who also has a social anxiety I feel you... And yes, there were times when I felt worthless and even thoughts of suicide came on my mind. That temptation can be very strong. 

One thing you should not do, is to keep it for yourself, the fact you already shared this with us is a very good thing. You should talk about it with someone who is close to you and who you trust. Be it your therapist or your parents. But please please please talk about it. If you keep it to yourself it will only get worse. You can talk also to me if you want someone with similar experience."

"Hey 29M here.. Please don’t do this… and I’ll tell you why. 

1. You are so young and still have PLENTY of time to see other parts of life you didn’t even know existed 

2. I personally tried to kill myself back in 2016 with a pistol and I promise you that I’m thankful to this day that nothing went as planned 

3. The most suffering we do is in our mind and not in reality.

4. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem….. once you’re gone that’s it….

5. Please…. As a complete stranger I’m asking you to not do this…. Just give yourself a chance, take life 1 day, 1 moment at a time. 

6. Last but not least…. You’re not dumb, you’re not worthless, your just a young woman who’s going through a rough time, as you get older your way of thinking will change and you might just start seeing the humor in things. 

Idk you but on behalf of Reddit, a fellow human.. please… please do not do this.

Also if you don't do it right it's an agonizing death (from what I've read, again not giving you pointers)

"I am so so sad that you feel this bad that I am crying.. I would just like to hold you. 

I remember myself in high school, when I felt isolated, unimportant, and ugly. I remember writing a list of things ""worth living for"" and reasons to just die. All reasons to live for felt fake. I couldn't imagine having fun friendships where I would feel relaxed, valued and wanted, my familiy was kind of like in a fog, guys and sex were so far from my imagined possibilities and my phisical features made me ashamed to be in public or fear attention as it could lead to humiliation (in my mind). 
However I didn't cry so much then, I just felt numb and life felt meaningless. 

But now as a 31F it really breaks my heart and makes me cry when I remember and imagine  hurting so bad. I really really promise you it will pass and the world will look different. 

My experience was that very very slowly a ""grown up"" version of myself started to emerge inside me, and that "" grown up me"" took care of my broken self and loved me and knew how to comfort me. World looks different now, I have ups and downs, struggles and worries and excitements, but I am not at the bootom of the ocean anymore. I am driving my small dear ship through the ocean myself, riding on panic, despair and pride and joy. There are storms and calm days but it is completely different then before when I felt motionless and drowned. 

I have years of therapy and I am still in therapy, and I plan to continue with it for the rest of my life. Not because there is something wrong with me but because I learned there are possibilities to live with more satisfaction and I hope to have even more subtle changes that will lead to something better in the future.

Please give yourself time, this is a little planet and we are all just walking on top of it and spinning together around the sun.

What makes me so important? There are billions of other people in the world, what makes me so different? I am just a disappointment to everyone in my life. My dad's girlfriend made me feel that way many times. At school, I am literally such a mess, I hate that I have social anxiety and just anxiety in general and that it's hard for me to keep a simple conversation going, even with my best friends! I hate my appearance, I hate that I can't be confident enough to do many things that I wanted to do because I am so freaking shy. If anything, people probably think I'm just a very awkward loser. And even though they never really said that to me, I know that that's probably what they're thinking. I've had depression for years (2017-18) and with everything I've been through, with my dad taking me to billions of doctors' appointments and me even going to a mental hospital last December, I am just such a disappointment.

"Not necessarily depression but the issues you're avoiding accumulate and exacerbate over time and can make an absolute wreck of your nerves and daily life. I fall into this cycle like clockwork. You can, and should, learn to live with it. It takes an all-nighter or two where you actually force yourself to do SOMETHING you've been putting away/avoiding. The little bit of dopamine released will feel fan-fucking-tastic and, similarly to physics, the principle of inertia applies here as well. It's insanely difficult to start moving but at the same time you can coast off having done (or at least started) something and gained a little bit of clarity.

We *need* dopamine to function ""normally."" Without a sense of accomplishment or of ""being on the right track"" we start to get anxious, very anxious, we lose sight of the future, the purpose and reason for living. It's your caveman DNA telling you to go be productive or stop wasting your tribe's resources. 

It might not sound pleasant to hear that it's ""all your fault"" but from another perspective it's ""under your control."" Yeah, sure, that's also added pressure, but... trust me, just try moving forward, do anything productive, see if that helps. I'd bet you'll end up feeling at least somewhat empowered, and at that moment try to think back at the ""under your control"" notion. Does it still feel like pressure or like a challenge you're eager to conquer? 

Also therapy helps. Mainly with perspective shifts (i.e. going from ""your fault"" to ""your control""). I'd been in therapy and on meds for 12 years. I'm turning 35 this year. My experience may not translate to yours but I'm very confident it at least partially would. 

TL;DR It's up to you. If you have a desire to try and get out of this shitty situation, you just have to put in some work and confront that which you've been avoiding."	Unfair_Tart_7	reply	na	na	na	0.9989392161369324	no	strong	no	na	depression

It sounds like, by the way you describe your depression, as if you could benefit from friendship and intimacy. You lack connection with others. You are aware of your lack of connection with others. From here you need to ask yourself; if connecting with others more intimately will improve how I feel, why am I not doing it?

"What's the source of your concerns with turning thirty? Mine was my father coming down and telling me that I would end up homeless when they sold the house despite the fact that I was good with technology and the very easy connection to make is I would come with them to Texas to find a job working in or around technology so that I could do something I enjoyed as everywhere in Oklahoma turned me away expecting something like certification or something before even giving me a chance despite my experience in the hobbies around technology to demonstrate that I knew what I was talking about and actually very engaged with technology. I guess being too close to the pulse of cutting edge technology is a detriment for an employee in an electronics store like best buy to have.

Too concerned about profits rather than actually being concerned with customer satisfaction for good recommendations on what they should buy to fit their wants or needs within a budget. I hate how my life has turned out when I needed family the one found family I had turned me away for struggling and wanting to vent, my actual family calling me lazy, failure and more by not understanding how I was miserable doing most jobs and I would adjust to doing better only for things to become hectic setting off my anxiety triggering a meltdown to where I perform poorly, further feeding into my concerns I am not keeping pace enough to be retained especially for service industry jobs that look to cut positions or down size for profit constantly.

Life is miserable full of CEO's who like to pretend they care while having astonishingly higher wage gaps than ever before seen in recorded history, a true testament to the rampant avarice of humanity. I would love to see nothing more than to watch the world crumble as they're the first people to suffer greater agony than those currently suffering people are perfectly capable of being creative as long as it hasn't been taken away from them.

The excessive usage of antipsychotics along with the dismissal of the harms they cause to people, psychiatrists not listening to how treatments work to reduce the thoughts of being better off gone, along with the disappearance of these thoughts they are also effectively challenged by how such actions would be pointless...but no gotta go to Seroquel XR and keep you on it despite the loss of cognition and more which would have allowed for working in technology or writing a book someday."

i got into therapy and medications. after a few months i felt better. i still have social anxiety and depression but i try to make some kind of social connection with people.  i have no friends and just keep to myself. its difficult. im working on trying to make friends right now but the older you get it seems the harder it is to form those relationships. i still play games but not abusively, like 1-2 hours a week. im not sure theres any escaping reality. i mean playing games helps to keep your mind away from thinking the bad things for a while. to me its like we just have to face it and work with where we are so far. i just hope for the best and keep working at it. basically just working through this loneliness and eventually things will get better. also i do have low self esteem and am working on that too. i exercise and try to take good care of myself. i always am afraid what people think of me and how i look like. so i try to build my confidence little by little. by looking better, i feel better. by having more money i feel better. being able to afford nice things for myself gives me more confidence to talk to people and not feel bad for myself. i guess i could say ive gotten past my depressive phase and i am just dealing with lingering issues. but yea honestly the best things helping me is meds and therapy. learning how to see things in a different perspective instead of a fixed lens makes a big difference on how you view yourself and life. because we have beliefs that may not even be true. and other people may not even think about us how we think of ourselves. sometimes we think too much. atleast in my case.

"To offer you a bit of insight in what helped me in my depression.

Misunderstandings and jealousy. When you speak to someone else, offer them your intentions first, because nobody requires a whole psycho-philosophy-medical degree to understand that part. That allows enough time for others to accept or reject you, rather than having to leave first to be able to question your intentions. 

This clears up so many frequent misunderstandings: for example in group settings I have always been misunderstood, because I either speak to the person I am looking at or I choose to speak generally for everyone. <- see that example how confusing this would be if we assume that everyone wants to respond now? It's ripe for misunderstandings, strife and conflict and we will probably never figure out who is talking to who.

At first that skill of transparency will be entirely unnatural, because it's not a perfected skill. ""Is this guy for real?"" Moving on to the topic of jealousy. That reaction is exactly what you want to avoid, the jealous types that arent interested in what you have to say. You just walk away from those, because avoidance is also a skill that you practice. Then you see things more clearly as you are more skilled and you naturally have more people you trust and can understand their intents and what they lie about.

Avoiding things is not necessarily bad, there are simply other things that you prioritize. AVPD is a tough one that requires therapy if it's diagnosed, but since it's only your perspective in account so far, honestly we are all hypocritical. We know that there are necessary evils that we have to go through so we can get to the things that are at the top of the priority."

i feel so alone. i feel like i have nobody in the world, i haven’t been hugged in so long that my back actually hurts from the lack of touch. i fucking hate myself. there’s no point in me being alive if all i can do is complain about how i feel but yet get no response from anyone, it just makes me feel so worthless. i’ve been suicidal for ages. i started self harm in 2021 and it feels like my only escape. im not making it to my birthday.

"Depression can definitely make you feel this way. I don’t know what kind of family you have to not have hugged you at all recently, but you deserve better. Things can get better even though it sometimes doesn’t feel like it. Please please focus on trying to find some trusted adults. It can be extended family, someone at school, a coach, etc. you deserve a safe space to vent and talk. Get into therapy. Find your own family and people. Find your passions and things that make you, “you” (and it’s okay if that changes often!!)

I’m kind of approaching 30 and am still depressed and dealing with some life shit, but I’ll tell you, this depression doesn’t compare to the feeling of middle school time. At this age, people are really thrown into social cliques and isolating others and really just being mean and testing boundaries. It’s terrible. It really is studied and found to be a difficult time. I really do promise, it gets better than it is right now. Being around the age you are now honestly sucks. A lot of adults don’t get it and won’t even try, even though they struggled too, they won’t acknowledge it. That I will never understand. You can be different someday than them, though. This feeling does not last forever. Please don’t make a permanent decision on something that is temporary. 

I fully believe you are feeling lonely, hurt, unheard, and like you hate yourself. I believe it isn’t just your age and I don’t want it to sound that way. It seems like people around you are not comforting and are invalidating, too. I just think that your age (not being “young” or anything like that, just the specific time you’re in) contributes greatly due to my experience and those close to me who agree that this time in life is extra rough. 

I’m not sure what your life is like but I can speak on mine. I was abused as a kid and waited for it to all end constantly. While life as an adult is definitely not perfect, if I compare it to how I felt in middle school, I definitely feel much more free. Like I am my own person. I really do promise that it gets better and is worth sticking around to see."	Loveleyxkris	reply	na	na	na	0.999152421951294	weak	no	no	na	depression

I do things in stages which helps. So on the day I’m always thinking there’s no way I can do this. But I break down into steps and do one thing at a time. So for example I’ll just go brush my hair. Then I’ll just put some pants on. Then a top. Don’t think about what’s next. Then Ill think to myself I’ll just drive there, I can always leave before I go in. By the time I’m there I might as well go in. This helps me tackle something overwhelming.	Hot_Fig_6651	reply	na	na	na	0.999510645866394	no	strong	no	na	depression
I think there's a huge part of this where if you have been depressed for a while and been spending most of your day in bed on the internet and being unkept and unproductive.  You won't want to go out.  You know you're putting a subpar, disgusting version of yourself out there.  Eventually, you will need to wash up and get a haircut do some laundry.  And just those 3 things making it possible for you to leave the house with enough dignity where you aren't completely frozen or self-loathing.

Ive took the approach of being open about it now. I tell people my depression is holding me back and ask them not to hold it on me. If they do moan about it then its not someone i want near me anyways. I find nowadays alot more people understand. I think once you lie to them it breaks another boundary and puts out far more guilt then and as such causes anxiety.

Yeah I have done this tons of times and lost a lot of friends from it.  It's frustrating for everyone.  I think if you know you aren't in the best state of mind, it's a good idea to not commit to any plans or big ideas.  Also, if you cannot get out of bed, you might just have to be honest and say you are sick.  And at the very least communicate that you are not late or coming later, you are not going at all.

"Understandable. I've thankfully managed to amass a big friendgroup of mentally ill folk who do get it and it's been so helpful to have people who just get it. A friend of mine canceled lunch a few weeks back because they were feeling socially worn down and then they reminded me multiple times last week when we went out that I could say no if I wasn't feeling up to it. We went out and we both tapped out socially at just the same time and both went home and had long naps. It was like mentally ill synchronicity, haha.

"""I'm too obvious"". My coworker at work brought this up to me nonchalantly as we were talking and I was like what do you mean? And he says ""I can predict everything about you. The shit you say, the shit you do"". He wasn't joking, and I knew it was true. And he didn't even say it to bring me down or anything, he just casually mentioned it in a talk.

I've got thickish skin after working manual labor for so long but this actually stung. Because I knew it was true, and subliminally I've known for a long time that this was the case but I never fully realized it, my entire social identity is basically an NPC with programmed responses, which are composed of conversations I've had millions of times before and a complete inability to freestyle conversation and think on my feet.
All my responses are basically rehearsed, I rarely speak a sentence I haven't already spoken, the conversations are always more or less prefabricated.

Anyways I have no idea how to fix it and act like a normal person I've been working out taking up hobbies and trying to be a better person in general so I'll be a more interesting person but who you are inside doesn't matter if you can't express that outwardly to the people around you. I think it might be related to the fact that I've had depression and social anxiety since I was like 13 and rarely spoke to anybody without being required to, not for lack of trying just not knowing how to.

Hopefully someone here reads this and can relate somehow, or maybe share some advice. I appreciate you and have a good day"	External_Elevator769	post	23.201681048019317	male	White	0.9945709109306335	na	na	na	13	depression

I don't see that fact that your coworker can predict everything about you as a bad thing. Once you get to know people pretty well that often happens. Can you predict anything about him?

"Do you talk to people online much? Like leave comments on posts and things? If you don’t, maybe starting by doing that could open the door to you feeling more comfortable being yourself.

I also wouldn’t take being predictable as a bad thing. One of my very best friends is the most predictable person in the world, which makes her a great friend. She’s always consistent and reliable, and I’m never confused about our friendship. She knows this too she is totally okay with being that way. 

What were you and your coworker talking about? It sounds like you were having a casual conversation with him! You’re definitely capable of it.

If you worry that you don’t seem very inviting or friendly because of your anxiety, a smile goes a long way! Also giving a random compliment (hey, I like your hat) is a great way to practice some social contact. During the pandemic, I would compliment like every cashier or employee I came across because I was so desperate for any type of conversation. And these were people I’d likely not see again, so if it got weird (which it never did), I didn’t have to worry about it. I hope that helps! Nothing is wrong with you.

"Firstly- I think all of us can be very socially predictable- especially at work. If you’re an introvert like me- the more I have to socialize the more I feel that too and fall back on lower effort pleasantries. 

I think no matter the context, a coworker or acquaintance saying that to you was a dick thing to say regardless of how they meant it. 

Way easier said than done but your interactions with coworkers definitely don’t have to define you and don’t need to bring the same value as what social time with close friends or family does."	External_Elevator769	reply	na	na	na	0.9945709109306335	weak	strong	no	na	depression

"Yes, this happens. Among the many misconceptions of depression is the belief that it is essentially sadness, but it lasts slightly longer and it’s permanent during that period. However, most depressed people are still able to chuckle at something every now and then, or enjoy an experience very once in a while. Im currently feeling the happiest I’ve felt in literally ages, and I can just hope I’ll use it to get out of this spiral, but I remember at the start of my depression in March (I wasn’t aware of the fact it was depression) when I would go out with friends, I would enjoy it so much cos it makes me so happy, then randomly halfway through, i would go from the loudest to the quietest person there, and would spend the rest of the time depressed, going home and feeling shit about myself for ruining the day. 

So yh it’s normal. Another thing is that I feel the depression is almost a part of me, so when I am happy, it almost feels wrong, because I have depression so I should be sad, right?

All I can say is try to enjoy your good days as much as you can, and maybe write down all the good things that happened, maybe in a diary. I use an app called Diary With Password, it’s simple but you can go back and read your good days, which would encourage you to dwell on happy memories rather than sad ones, which is a massive problem for depressed people.

Good luck; we love you ❤️"	Kiwis0nKrak	reply	na	na	na	0.008450922556221485	no	no	no	na	depression

"…I am currently in a really bad depression phase. I know that depression is not something to be cured, but managed. I’m in therapy, I’m medicated and I have supportive friends and family. But I don’t want to keep telling them the same story over and over again. I want to be better for them…but I’m not…and I’m not sure if I ever will be…

I just, don’t want to reach out to people who already have their own problems to deal with. I don’t have any reason to feel this way, nor do I know how others can help me. 

So I don’t know what else to do. Nothing makes this feeling go away, nothing ever lasts. I’ve tried a gratitude journal, which helps briefly, but then it all feels superficial. I’ve tried all the cliche stuff. Now I’m often wondering “what’s the point?”, so I’m binge eating, not taking care of myself. I’m in a state of total numbness and apathy. I don’t care about myself, I hate myself. I don’t understand how to exist in the world, when all I ever seem to do is fuck up. 

Also, I hate it when you tell people about your mental illnesses, but then, when you behave like someone with a mental illness, they judge you for it. Like, I TOLD YOU I HAVE ISSUES, why are you now judging me?

I just need to say it somewhere: I am not ok. I don’t want pity, I just hope that someone reads this and understands this unexplainable cloud of nothingness that never goes away.  Why do I feel at my worst, when good things happen?

"I have been in that situation and honestly I understand what you are going through.Tbh that nothingness never really does fully go away but as you u go on in life sometimes we learn to live with it. You'll always feel a gaping hole somewhere in all you do but learning to deal with them on your own is a process. 

People surely don't understand mental health issues and their severity but in such a case you're the one who has to take the first step and reach out to a professional for help directly. Not everyone needs to understand what you are going through. Reach out to a professional, get their help, although it may seem like too much of a work especially when you don't have energy anymore and are feeling down, but u have to start somewhere. Maybe not today or tomorrow but you gotta get out of that shell someday. Reaching out to a professional therapist will surely help you

It sounds clicheish but you're not alone, don't feel that way. This community is meant for being there for one another and whenever u feel like sharing, it's always here.

"Hi all, 

Been dealing with depression for years and it recently came to an all time low so I've been wanting to branch out and try new things to help me get through it. I have a therapist I see once a week now and that certainly helps but unfortunately the support system I have around me at home(i.e wife) is not the greatest. She's more of a tough love type person and that certainly doesn't vibe me with me. I'm just curious if any others are in my situation and where do you guys turn to for some comfort? Before anyone says it's a toxic relationship it's really not she does care for me just doesn't really understand depression and grew up with a tough love family so it's hard for us to meet each other halfway on things like this. Any resources you guys have besides this sub for help and just being able to talk it out?"	Emblazoned1	post	32.84812642272094	male	White	0.9821401238441467	na	na	na	3	depression

"(18 male) 
Don’t toss your money to this “helpful” system. I had to go to treatment in my high school years without option and the system is corrupt. Therapy is decent for the daily issues of life, but eventually the seasons turn into a waste of time. Never really fixing you. You can try it if you are curious but don’t get too attached with the idea. Instead, I turn to YouTube. Philosophy of the whole problem with existence. Alan Watts, a British-American professor at some big school in LA also philosopher, and Jiddu Krishnamurti, a Buddha. (Buddha means “awakened one” and the Buddha we think and talk about is the original guy. Through his followers and ideas, more people have awakened, becoming another Buddha) 
I began to look at my problems like a puzzle. “How do we solve it?” And this is how society wants you to look at it, so we end up becoming programmed into the fixing of problems. The cure. So you end up tossing all your money into therapy and medication but the solution is with your mind. 
How does one defeat depression? You don’t. You can get rid of it though & not struggle with pain. “How?” By simply observing completely without thoughts or judgement, without labeling what you are experiencing as good/bad/brutal/and so on…, and to realize where problems are created and made into this world. From there, the “problems” don’t become problems. And you feel free. 
So I suggest you look into these two names above because not only do they do into the deep roots of mankind, they also guide you to figure out how you work, how to get “rid” of your suffering. Heck, it took me a while to find them and once I did, I changed. Not by them or some higher”power, but by investigating thought and existence."

He’s just told me he’s got a new gf. So soon. It’s really brought me down under again. I’m so heartbroken and I don’t have any friends or girl friends to talk to. I feel like I’m really coming to the end of my existence and I just don’t have anyone. I’m happy for him because I love him and always want the people I love to be happy but god this really hurts on top of a really really hard year. I’m floundering on every front.

I admit that it's bad, but that doesn't change much, I've read that if you want to leave this you should focus on improving things that interest you or something like that, I think my problem would be that I don't really have something to I want to improve, I mean, I feel a great emptiness when I think that if I continue with this type of thing I will end up worse, even so I keep trying to leave it and try to find something that gives value to the effort I make for not wanting to maybe one day go to sleep and not wish to disappear from this world. Sometimes it would be better, I think for many, not to disconnect from social networks, but rather from the internet, like on vacation, I admit that this worked more than any other method.

and, same as you, i don't have a lot in my life that i feel like i could improve on if i wanted to. i don't have a lot of other interests. they always say that if you're depressed, you should spend more time doing the things that you love. and i love to cum. sorry to be crude. but i'm chasing the dopamine high i get from it. 

and i personally don't see it as a bad thing. it's just a tool to help me cope. 

but that's just me. if you struggle to have a healthy relationship with porn, maybe you should try to take a break. if you can. 

also, medication. medication helps. and i encourage you look into it if you haven't already. i've been on wellbutrin for most of my life. 

and i would encourage you to spend time with other people. depression often makes us want to isolate ourselves. but don't listen to it. join local clubs. look into the website [meetup.com](https://meetup.com). building a social life, and spending time with other people, could help distract you from the urge to watch porn."

"Isolating (staying in at home alone) creates an environment that lends itself to casual porn consumption. It helps to: get out of the house; do an activity that occupies a lot of time; do something physically exhausting; do things that keep you around others. Dismantle structures that make it easy like bookmarks, and get in touch with what gives you deep satisfaction, not just easy dopamine hits.

I think it needs to be said that you don’t need a morality lecture; porn can be enjoyed responsibly like any vice. Sexuality and self pleasure aren’t inherently “evil” if indulged in moderately, safely, and respectfully.

"Do you by chance use weed or any other drugs that might increase the amount of porn you watch?

I've struggled with weed addiction personally. I thought I had a porn addiction, but I'm learning I don't watch nearly as much porn when I'm sober. 

When I consistently get high, stay in my room and play games/watch TV, and the phone, I would constantly watch porn as part of my routine pretty much.

I still will watch porn but not nearly as much time lately and I don't believe I'm quite as addicted as I thought. BTW I first started watching porn at 11. 

My advice would be to start by paying attention to patterns in when you consume porn. Then, I would consider trying to taper back and moderate it before worrying about cold turkey. Also, as other people said, you are craving the endorphins, and when you're depressed it makes sense you will gravitate to something that produces that.

"Hello,

I took 5mg escitalopram for one week and then 10mg for 3 weeks. However, I did not notice any improvement. The psychiatrist now says I should be on 15mg for 5 days and then on 20mg.

I'm afraid there'll be a side effect due to the high dose, and I don't know if it'll do anything. She said if there's no side effects so far, there's no side effects at a higher dose. But why should the main effect be better at a higher dose?

In addition, my doctor did not do an ECG or anything else, which according to my research is the standard and does not make her seem very serious in my eyes.

I also don't know if pills do anything for me, because life itself just seems pointless to me. It seems to me that the therapists and psychiatrists just want to turn you into a hedonist who works a good 40-hour week so that you have money on the weekend to do things that you enjoy. But what is the point of this concept, why is life better than death? I just don't like this concept and I don't think the tablets will do anything.

I don't really want to increase the dose, but I'm also afraid to stop taking the tablets.

Do you have any experience with dose increases, especially of escitalopram? Or any other tips for me?

Thank you."	ConstructionNew5643	post	17.252929525861816	male	White	0.9984925985336304	na	na	na	1	depression

My friends were mostly fake, and those few real friends I had now turned their backs on me because of something trivial like not being able to go out with them cuz I was so busy. 

I've been living off of insomnia for so long now, and when I do sleep, I keep having gruesome nightmares about someone trying to murder me, or about someone sexually assaulting me. 

I thought my meds(Abilify(for my hallucinations), exulten(antidepressant), benadryl(for sleep)) were working, but somehow, I've gotten more explosive when it comes to my emotions, I've began to hallucinate even more to the point where I can't discern reality from my hallucinations, I've lost all love towards drawing(which is one of if not my biggest passion in life), and my insomnia got worse to the point where I went from having broken sleep patterns to none at all. 

I thought I was getting better, I've been clean off of self-harm for months until last week, and I've cut so deep that it wouldn't stop bleeding until day 3.

Maybe pushing myself to the extremes(when training karate) is also my form of self-harm. I would just not give up. I would just work myself to the bone until I feel like throwing up. No matter how many times my teacher tells me to rest for once, I just couldn't. I don't know why. I feel like I deserve the pain for some reason. Maybe Karate is one of my ways to prove myself that I can be better. Maybe that's one of the reasons why I do that. To make people look at me for once. Maybe one of the reasons why I work myself to the bone, is because I would always think that if I work hard enough, I would break down and finally die. 

I just feel done. I don't want to work anymore. I don't want to continue school, I don't want to move, I just want to die.

""Everyone loves you."" does not make me feel better. This world proved to me that no one does. Only those who come to me only need help from me.

""Think about us, how would you think we would react when you kys?"" Can you imagine the pain I've been through for all my life? I've been verbally abused, I've been left alone in the dark for years, 
I've been bullied, and harrassed because of you.

""Seek a therapist."" I had to seek out for therapists and they all told me I was just growing up. They all told me it was normal. My current therapist always postpones our therapy sessions because apparently they were ""too busy"". 

""It's okay."" No it's not.

I'm done.

I just want to kill myself. There's no point anymore.

No matter how many times you try to convince me not to, I won't be convinced.

I don't even need advices. I've been hearing the same advice ever since I learned to grow up by myself.

I just want to die."	1Shii	post	21.093038407284027	male	White	0.9898859262466431	na	na	na	0	depression
"And no one calls back!

As an adult. Ive handled my problems well. If something happens. Say a break up, i tend to work more, take lots of time to reflect. I work on a lot of self reflection in general everday life as well. Anger/anxiety issues, i use breathing techniques. Lately ive added mantras. I use yoga to relax. I travel to get away and, of course, reflect but also break, take an adult time out. I realize and often remind myself, especially lately (several times a day), that my feelings are not permanent. This will pass. Things WILL get better. This is currently all situational.

But things have gotten out of my control. It's really turning into a physical pain. I took a nap today, and i woke up in tears. Am i crying in my sleep?

I sat on my kitchen floor the other day and cried for an hour and a half. I knew i needed to do something. So yesterday, i started to seek out a grief counselor. I called 1 that seemed nice. She never called back. So today i called 10. No call backs. I called my primary to see if they can recommend someone. No call back. (My primary will probably call tomorrow, or not) but then this of course opened up these weird feelings. That ive already processed and put aside. 

But holy shit. I am not a factory. I cant process all these feelings at a million miles an hour!!! 

So i am back on my insurance website looking for a female therapist that specialize in grief counseling. 

Just needed to vent. Ive never spoken to a therapist. But none of my normals tools are working. 

I need backup STAT! Or at least in 48 to 72 hours."	greennurse0128	post	35.6448684235659	female	White	0.9977262616157532	na	na	na	2	depression

But man, this is random but there is something tranquil about midnight to 5 a.m. to me. I have memories of going out with friends at late nights and early mornings and just having so much love for them. Staying up by myself is nice too because there's no worries about others or about what's going on at the moment. Everyone I know is asleep and having dreams about things that are important to them. People are lying next to people they love.

I like to stay up and write late at night. About the day, the things I struggle with and my fears for the future. But because everyone is asleep, it feels like those fears are too.

"I’m 24 (m) and I am gay. I don’t really fit in anywhere. I’m a good looking guy. But I struggle to speak to people. I find I just get used for sex. It’s depressing. I was raped a few days ago. I love the gym and working out. But I feel like I’ve just lost my drive to do anything. My father died at the start of the year and my Ex who I loved greatly cheated on me then said he wanted to be poly. Which I do not want.

I feel really down. I know this will pass. I’ll try workout later. I just need to get my problems out my head as I can’t really share with my family or friend. I like keeping things to myself. 

I really want children and a traditional family. But I feel that’s so incredibly rare in the gay world. Where it seems most guys only think about themselves and themselves only.

"Hey. I am so sorry for all you’ve been through. Life’s truly been horrible to you lately. 

You’re right that how you feel right now will all pass, but it must feels like shit right now and that there must be times when that statement just doesn’t seem true or hold any value. You have to remember everything you’re going through right now, there are people out there that acknowledge the pain you’re feeling, and so please don’t ever think it is trivial. That your pain or how you feel or you are not important. That’s just not true.

This is gonna sound stupid but have you tried taking any action against the person that did that to you? I think you should. Feel free to reach out to me personally if you need someone to listen to you talk about it or anything else in general. 

And please don’t think that stuff about not having children. I am not gay and can’t profess to saying it’s not true when I don’t know a thing about the gay community. But you’re just 24. You have a whole life ahead of you. There are so many good people out there who are gay and will make a good partner to you. It may seem like that can never happen, right now, but you have to remember that’s just how you feel right now. Who knows if it will be true tomorrow or the week after, or a year from now. You can be 25 soon, with your entire life changing for the better and still have your whole life ahead of you to look up to.

Your pain is valid and important, but please remember it is not permanent, though it may not seem like that right now, deep down you have to remind yourself it is not permanent.

"I’m sorry you’re feeling this way. I don’t find anything to be fun either, but I have confirmed with my previous therapist that is due to Anhedonia. 

Have you heard of it? It just basically means that along with depression, you struggle to find pleasure in things. Even the few things that did still bring me joy, no longer do. It’s definitely a struggle. It may take some more experimenting to find something you can actually enjoy. 

Also, you said you have nothing to live for, but you said you have a gf. Is she in anyway causing you more distress? Because trying to uphold a relationship that’s is struggling can make your mental health much worse and I know that too well.

"People say “everyone deserves to be loved” as if they never think “so-and-so could do better.” People say “nobody deserves to be ashamed of themselves” but when listing examples they only picture people who are working (or looking for work), socially active and contribute to people around them. As for people who are stuck at home, have no talents or skills, no real life, it seems everybody silently accepts they should just be better, and if they can't they should hide themselves so nobody has to be embarrassed by their presence. 

I'm sick of the dishonesty. I wish people would tell me they think I'm pitiful instead of dancing around it all the time. And I wish everyone would stop pretending that everyone is worthwhile because it's such a blatant lie and when you live from the perspective of someone who is looked down on by everybody, you see it for how it truly is. Nobody believes this “everybody is worthwhile, nobody deserves to be ashamed of who they are” crap.

Was always judged for feeling how i felt when expressing myself. Bullied thru school had to accept it. Was called a cry baby growing up.
Fast forward, got married, and had twins at 28 weeks. Both are  special needs. Dealing with a mother that has no filter in her mouth, she's raw when she wants to control me even as an adult. My husband had an emotional affair for almost 3 years with his so-called work wife. He asked me what was wrong for making a woman feel good about themselves.That broke me cause this went on for years. I'm just so tired of past bad memories hauting me.

Do not harm yourself. There are better ways to cope and better days will come, but do not harm yourself. I live with these embarrassing scars and I’m ashamed every time I look in the mirror. It doesn’t help, and it’s extremely hard to get off once you get hooked.

"Dude, no more cutting.

I know depressed people dont want to call suicide hotlines so i will give you advice on how i managed my depression.

First of all. If you think that you look bad, remember a homeless person you once saw. Does he look more attractive then you? He is sitting on Concrete Dust and Dirt all day and you? You have a Shower you can use whenever you want, you can wash your Hands, you can go to a barber, everything, anytime you want. Wouldnt it be just unfair for you to just quit while people far worse are still sitting there and hoping for there best?

Now, if you feel lonely or alone remember this. There are people probably people sitting somewhere at the local Bar. They arent lonely or alone but most of them are still sad, because happines doesnt come from other people, first you should know how to handle being alone and lonely before you talk to someone or else the hole will feel even worse after you talked with them or done something with them.

I have also had Depression for 4 Years now, at first i  thought if i would just die alone somewhere but from there on my life just got better."	MINTYpl	reply	na	na	na	0.999200165271759	weak	strong	strong	na	depression

"When I was a kid I had a normal healthy body but ever since I found out about junkfood I was instantly hooked into eat. I would eat large amount of junkfood everyday. I turned fat by grade 3 and I was bullied because I was fat.

After the bullying, I dont know but after that, I was already having anxiety because I always think of what people think of me ever since the bullying happened and I was bullied until grade 5.

Then after the bullying I started to hate myself for being stupid and fat. In school I'm never good at asking questions when being asked by the teacher. There was this one incident on grade 9 which is still with me. There was this teacher asking questions to the students and I was one of the lucky ones to be asked. The teacher asked me to stand up and answer the question she asked, I stood up there like a statue because I couldn't answer the simple question (I have forgotten the question). The teacher said ""Why can't you answer the simple question? You're already grade 9 and couldn't answer a simple question!?"" She was mad and humiliated me infront of the class and at that time I was a bit teary because I really felt the words she said. Ever since that Ive also developed self-doubt and my self-loathing has developed into  suicidal thoughts 

Now every start of school I breakdown and cry because school is starting and I'm that  the past experiences might happen again. Now I'm in college and survived first day of classes ended up breaking down after classes doubted myself if I can do/finish college. Im scared of failing thinking that Im a failure. Im fully online on college still because of anxiety. Im not comfortable in public mostly when Im alone. Im fidgety with my hands and clothes. I always wear large baggy clothes go hide my fat body. Im scared of the grade 9 incident happening again. Sometimes I feel like a voice in ny head telling me im a piece of shit and im not good at anything. At home all I do is stay in my room and play video games because thats the only thing keeping me happy ig. Ive always opened up to my dad but ending up getting scolded because why am I like this he ask and said im ungrateful. 

Additional stuff: because of the happenings it also affects my life like simply going outside makes me uncomfortable and sometimes I cant buy food outside or order food in a fast food. When I breakdown I really lose interest in everything for a while like playing video games, lose of appetite and just wanna sleep all day.

I have a computer, I have tons of games to play, but I don't want to do anything. I'm always so bored and lonely. This has been going on for months, maybe years.

"Yeah, this has been happening to me for years now, since 2018. For me, it's having things I want to do, but not knowing what to do. Like I can't make a decision so I just end up doing nothing at all. Haven't found any cure for it. Like buying a game I've been looking forward to, but not starting it for months. Pirating a movie, and never watching it. Wanting to go get some food outside, or wanting to go to the library for a new book but I just sit in bed. It feels like a combination of laziness and lack of motivation. Nothing really ever ""pulls"" or ""compels"" me anymore. When I was younger I remember the feeling of ""hype"" and thinking about something so much and so hard and finally getting to experience it was amazing. Now I don't really feel anything much. There is no hype or positive feelings of expectation, and when I do the thing I don't feel very accomplished or happy about it, it's just like yaay I watched a movie, okay, now what do I do? I used to turn movies over in my head and cry thinking about some of them, now things just don't hit like they used to. 

It feels like I like the idea of doing things more than I actually like doing them now, or like there's an invisibile barrier between me and these things which feels impossible to get through. Or I feel/know I'm not going to enjoy it so I don't bother trying. Why bother if it doesn't give me dopamine? Idk. Every now and then I'll do something. I managed to sit down yesterday and finally watch Wall-E for the first time, something I've wanted to do for years. I've gotten better at forcing myself to do things. That's mostly because I've started to grow tired of doing nothing, so I just forced myself to do things, just to break up the monotony. Even if I just read 5 pages of a book or play 1 hour of a game, or watch the first 30 minutes of a movie, go to the store for groceries I just look at it as ""well at least I did something today."" It's still difficult. I think it's executive functioning disorder, we have a hard time regulating our activities and carrying them out.

"I hear you like most do, but not entirely in that plain ricey way.

You see what happened was what you said which most in their own consideration translate to neigh at the naughty night race we're all trapped in.... went right in one ear, right out the other, and it's coming round in fast right past Hidalgo, leaving Secretariat, Roach, and Bojack (I only know 4 horse names from all this time it seems....)  in the dust to smack the guy sleeping at the finish line waiting to be trampled to death  with his own ear wax candle.

One of those horses must have been a smoker because something lit that candle and a little bitty bit of light shone in the darkness and said you'll always matter to yourself and if any defined ""success"" doesn't care for that then it's a failure of a system and hey man who uses a crooked ass ruler to measure themselves by eh. Not even bean counters do that.

So I truly hear you and even see you dimly through the light of my own ear wax candle. I could even smell you some but admittedly that could be me. I can't feel you though, you're too hot to the touch. Last time I tried to ""feel you bro"" in this candle situation they singed my fingers. It hurt for days took me months to forgive them.

The world wasn't made for me but I've been living in it despite that.
My medicine is almost at is limit and so am i.
I've reached a point where i don't even know if i wish to get better.
I only derive emotion from shows and movies.
My bed is the only place i feel solace.
I think im gonna wait till my grandma dies of cancer. I don't want her to feel any grief.

I have never felt happiness. My autism keeps me away from people. I've tried working but it always leads to me having so little energy i go nonverbal or try to end it.

The world feels too tough for me. If everything is bad then why keep going? When i cant get more medicine ill be at a crossroads between misery or death, and i think the best answer is a bit too obvious.

I know it sounds like bad advise but try doing stuff you enjoy most while high on weed, or go for a hike, nature always heals. Weed will give you a different point of view on your life and you'll start feeling emotions again. But dont abuse it. Dont take the saddest path, instead try finding your new reason of living.

The other night when I was trying to sleep and my mind was like haunted by humiliation and weird shit I've endured from my past the one comfort I felt was imagining my self in a coffin, knowing all this shit would cease soon enough.

I even tried praying and asking God why my existence was like this, i don't even believe in God but i just thought I'd try it out, nothing, no signs, just what I expected.

The world isn't designed for us, that's the issue.

Depression is your primal nature telling you how you're living is unnatural.

And that's just what society wants, it wants us dead, deprive of us community, affection, stick us in an unnatural routine, and only those who are moronic, lack higher thought, or are too brainwashed to see how shit their existences are thrive.

"Not sure if this needs a NSFW tag but I'll err on the safe side. 


I have reccuring dreams nearly every night where I'm being tortured, hurt, or killed by someone. It's always the same person, but I can never remember what they look like when I wake up. I want to know their name, but I never remember to ask.

In the dreams, the situation is always different, but the outcome is always the same. I start out with a normal dream, and then he shows up and tries to hurt me. Sometimes I try and fight back or run away, but once I realize it's not getting anywhere I stop fighting back and let it happen. Other times I don't fight back at all and just accept my fate. 

I'm a very vivid dreamer. A lot of times, I feel pain in my dreams, sometimes I'll even feel it for a few moments after I wake up. It hurts. It hurts so much but it's better than being awake.

I've tried seeing therapists, I've reached out to everyone I trust about my depression and anxiety. I've tried a few different meds, but because of another condition, I get a lot of side effects and I have to stop taking them. I don't know what to do.

The last dream I had, he shot with with a nail gun over and over again until I passed out. When I woke up, my head was on his lap and he asked if I wanted to wake up. I said no. I hate it so much, but it's better than being awake. Anything is better than being awake. He kept going, but he lowered the intensity so I don't die. This lasted for 3 days, until I couldn't stay alive any more. When I died I woke up. I don't want to be awake. My dreams are horrible, but the waking world is so much worse.

It doesn't happen often, but sometimes I have dreams where he doesn't show up. I take matters into my own hands. Usually I jump into large bodies of water and go to sleep, but this isn't the only method.

I hate it so much. But when I wake up I'm sad it's over. The pain is excruciating, but it's better than the pain I feel in real life. I'm not sucidal any more, so you don't have to worry about me killing myself, but I don't know what to do. I'm hurting."

"Hello,
My startup is going through a tough time. We only have money left for the next 3 months. Even after trying very hard and showing good progress, we are not able to get more resources. The idea of shutting down my business and finding a job has shut me down. I'm descending into depression.

My brain is all foggy and I'm unable to do the most basic tasks. I've lost interest in everything. I've had a bad bout of depression last year and scared that it's happening again. I've never had many friends and derived most of my self worth from my work.

I try to workout 3-4 times a week and meditate 2 times a week. But off late my energy levels are so low, I can't exercise or meditate properly.

I write this to support you and say I feel the same. Living under pressure is not an easy thing. At first, it seems fine but eventually, one thing overlaps with another and suddenly, you can't take it anymore.  It feels like an abrupt, sudden, and harsh breakdown.

"24 f here,I feel like I hate my life. I've never had a serious relationship and I've never kissed a guy,I'm a virgin. This year it finally hit me how for the last 4 years my mental health was in shambles. I still live at home with my parents, because I was studying till last year and still working on my career and am not financially capable enough to move out-plus I'm Asian so it's not even considering very bad for me to still be living at home.
I'm not even confident enough to drive by myself, I'm full of self-doubt and the past 2 years I just experienced such self loathing thoughts,I'm an introvert, was a really shy kid,and I hate this about my personality, I've always wished I was different, was an extrovert but the last 2 years,these thoughts were so amplified,it made me really dislike myself and dislike so many parts of my personality-I'm a people pleaser and feel like such a pushover,all I could think over the last 2 years was,wow I'm such a loser,doormat,not confident enough to drive,and I don't even have a career or am smart enough to find a job,still living at home,plus I'm fat and ugly-
yes on top of all this,I grew up fat,I managed to lose some weight over the last 1.5 years,but I've always been insecure because of this as well and heard things like you'd look nicer if you lost weight or you'll find a guy if you lost weight as a teenager and at 18 a guy even told me you'd look better if you lost weight-really made me believe I wasn't good enough and made me all the more closed of to guys and dating in the past 4 years.
Also,because of my awkward,quiet nature,I was unable to form a proper concerte friendship in college,despite being in college for 5 years. Isn't that so abnormal? A young person who has no proper friend from college? 
This made me dislike myself a lot more last year and really made me feel like had I been not me,had I been a non-awkward extrovert I wouldn't have this problem. 
I'm finally starting to realize just how much in shambles my mental health has been for the past,especially 4 years,and I hate it. Feels like I lost a part of my life,and as a result of which I ignored my dating life and even college social life for the past few years.
I just want to ask,is this normal? To be closed off socially due to shit,shit mental health.
Am I a loser because I haven't kissed anyone at this age where even 17 year olds are having sex? Also,I'm not one to hookup,or have casual sex,I'd prefer a genuine relationship,iam already self conscious and really awkward, is this another factor that is going to make things harder for me,dating wise?
Am I a complete weirdo or outcast because of this or am I doomed to be alone because of this?
Also,since I've just realized these things,as of now my priority is to just work on getting my career sorted, and to better my mental health and make a few new friends,join the gym and focus on my physical health as well-I don't want to prioritize dating as of now after the realization of how trash my mental health was.
Is that the right thing to do? 
Idk why,I feel like if I de-prioritize dating any further, I'll just die alone with no sexual experience, and will just become a weird outcast and people my age will eventually settle down,be married,etc. and will be heavily judged for being xyz age and not having had a  proper relationship or experience with physical intimacy. 
Can anyone relate/understand?
I feel like I cannot share any of this with my closest friends because they won't really understand, and I don't want to share something and have my feelings be dismissed or invalidated.

Also,if you managed to read everything, thank you so much!"	Any_Butterscotch5109	post	32.05553811025896	male	White	0.9977213740348816	na	na	na	2	depression

"I (28F) started a brand new career in a whole different industry recently after getting my degree. I graduated with a 4.0, but I was deeply struggling with anxiety and a severe depressive episode by the time I finished the degree due to stress overload. 

I'm now working underneath a senior staff member who is essentially my mentor/has the title that I would eventually like to have. There is understandably an immense amount of pressure to perfrom well and establish good relationships to make this career change successful. Ive been getting great feedback on my work but the working relationship between the mentor and I is extremely awkward. We are friendly but conversation is difficult, I cannot read him at all, I often worry that I've frustrated him or I'm falling short of expectation. I'm also shy/introverted and struggle with social awkwardness. In the first few months I couldn't handle the awkward pauses and would just talk and talk, making it worse. Now I try to practice speaking concisely, but it only seems to make the weirdness more obvious between us. I convinced myself that maybe he was just shy too and together it was just a tornado of weirdness. But a new intern started and instantly they are connected and talking and it sounds and looks so easy and natural between the two (both dudes). Now I'm worried it is an issue with me. 

I feel so awkward and uncomfortable at work because I'm so worried and anxious about doing well and making good impressions and going out of my comfort zone that it's literally draining me and I have felt like its gotten more and more difficult as the months have passed. 

Many times, I'm assigned tasks without sufficient explanation or background and I'm left to just figure it out. I manage it, but it caused a lot of stress and feeling of incompetency. I am worried that I'm smart enough, not well spoken enough, not social enough... Like I always thought I was capable but I'm finding out that I'm not.... 

I broke down and cried today. I don't want to feel this way... I want to feel like I belong and confident and happy but I don't know how to fix the awkwardness or let all this fear go."	xgc_promathia	post	19.369065117819215	female	White	0.9986557960510254	na	na	na	1	depression
"Part of this is surely imposter syndrome. You did the studies, and you are doing the job. 

The mentor seems a bad fit. 
It's nice to think about transfer, but that's not always an option. How to navigate is dependent on personalities, though. 

Me, I tend to call things out and state the changes i want or need, but that's got me fired before. 

if big company, you might have resources in other staff or the union or hr or something.   He also could be okay and sexist or awkward around gender stuff. 

i did lab work for a time.  I can say with certainty that the more technical the work the wilder the imposter syndrome gets. Everyone trying to look smart, everyone afraid to serm ignorant,  a lot of blank nods knowing there was hours of reading ahead to piece together the conversation that just happened.

It’s not like I’m getting bullied or don’t fit in or don’t have friends. You know, now that I’m writing this it seems to get stupider by the second. I’ve always been good at school, all A’s, awards, the whole shebang. But recently, this year, I think I’ve signed up for a class I just can’t do.  I’m enrolled in physics and on the first test I got my first ever failing test grade. I brought my grade up some through homework and it’s now a C but not necessarily a high one. The next test is coming up on the 24th and I genuinely don’t know what do and just thinking about it has made me so stressed out and sad that I actually felt compelled to write this. I’ve never once talked about how I feel with anyone ever. Anywho, to get back on track, the more I try to prepare for it the more hopeless it seems. I just can’t wrap my head around it and it’s made me feel useless and feel bad about myself. You can see how this goes, the more I prepare the worse I feel about myself and it’s just killed my motivation in other things and made me feel sick. It’s not just the test but the whole class. I really don’t know if I can make it and I can’t realistically drop the class this late in the year. It just feels better telling somebody I guess.

"Like actually. I am so mentally, emotionally and physically tired of meaning nothing to people. I am so tired of wasting my time and energy \*trying\* my hardest to overcome my depression and anxiety to reach out to people to just try and form some form of human connection only to get shot down and be left aside and forgotten and ignored. Time and time and time and time and time and time again.

I am oh so tired. Genuinely. I am touch starved. I go days without saying a single word. I can't sleep anymore. Food doesn't have taste anymore. Smells don't smell like they're supposed to anymore. 

All I do is wake up, go to work, be ignored by everyone all day while doing the same exact 11 tasks that i do every single day, get paid pennies on the dollar, go home and sit at my computer and see all my ""friends"" online and get ignored by every single one of them all night, then i go to bed to try to sleep.

Rinse and repeat.

Everyone seems to be so happy to have everyone else in their lives but once I come into the picture everyone just seems to vanish and scatter. No one ever checks up on me. No one ever asks me how I'm doing. It honestly feels like I could just die right now and it'll take everyone months to even realize i'm gone.

"I've been dealing with my depression for just under 15 years now, I'm arguably in the best place I've been in my life ever right now and it doesn't matter because i only care about making life better for the people I love. 

I get myself out of bed every morning and get to work by telling myself it's all for them because doing it ""for me"" just isn't motivational. 

I no longer feel hopeless, sometimes I think I might even feel happy but I'm so not used to that feeling that it's uncomfortable to feel that way, it just feels...off.

I've come to realize that the best way for me to feel content with staying alive right now, through everything I have to deal with, is to tell myself that someday I'll be able to have an out. That someday when I've made enough money to take care of the people I love, maybe set up a charity people can trust or done anything else that'd actually make the world a better place, I could find a peaceful place to end it all.

It's odd I think, but thinking about that outcome is the most peaceful feeling I've ever known, knowing that there's an end to the tunnel that I'm in. It isn't going to be any time soon, but I do live my life selflessly. I don't pursue a career or have any relationships because I feel like they'd ultimately be a waste of time and end in tragedy though, and I suppose that isn't the healthiest thing to do lol 

I've been thinking about how abnormal those feelings are, how backward my life has always been to the point that the closest I get to happiness is reminding myself that someday I can stop struggling, I know I can keep going until I've made a difference in the world and maybe even beyond that, but do other people feel this way?"

"My uncle attempted to slice his wrists to kill himself. This is the second time in a couple years. He nearly succeeded but now is medically stable and is going to a unit for psychiatric treatment.
How can I best help him? - He's very independent - He has multiple factors exacerbating (divorce a couple years ago that he's still not over, recent parkinson's diagnosis + can barely hold a bowl as he's VERY shaky, current struggles in his current romantic relationship, worsened function of his hands due to cutting, and recently was forced to retire from his medical profession).

I am an ER nurse and normally know how to handle this but it's different when it's family...I just want to give him a hug and make him know he's truly loved and cared for but he doesn't want to open up and wants to pretend things really aren't that bad and even if I did hug him and remind him I love him daily, that still doesn't take away even one of his problems that's exacerbating his SI :( In the past when I expressed my care for him, he often pulls away.

Im worried he might harm himself again after discharge from the psych facility as well :( It's so hard to watch as I grew up very close with him, but I've watched his life unravel for years and have been helpless to help him (I'm still getting my life together). My dad (his brother) also struggles with depression and he's living with my uncle, so I know the situation is weighing on him and his mental health too."	icropdustthemedroom	post	37.722296151678584	male	White	0.9922594428062439	na	na	na	1	depression
Hi I am so sorry for your situation! I truly hope your family is able to recover and move to a different place in the future that is healthier for everyone. I have recurrent and severe major depression (and other mental illnesses hehe), and I would say for me having this kind of extended illness aids to losing friendships and relationships of all kinds bc I think people assume depression is simple and can be fixed pretty quick and when that doesn’t happen they tire out and move along, leaving the former connection we had in a place that can’t be revisited. A lot of “friends” ,and family even, are uncomfortable with these types of diagnoses, in my experience. Doesn’t mean they don’t care!! Just want to distance themselves and not be too involved. With that being said, I tried incredibly hard to get friends to see me regularly when I was struggling at my worst and that was extremely difficult. I was able, in my darkest hour, to meet with a single friend 1-2x a month (who had no idea how sick I was/am) and we would meet out somewhere like a park or museum or restaurant (we live in a huge city so lots of different options) and just hung out for a couple of hours. I can surely say this person unknowingly saved my life. This is the only thing/outing I would have that month. This was the only time I did laundry in a month, etc. We always put the date and time on the calendar and planned ahead. The hangs were always reliable. Having it on the calendar was the only thing I had to look forward to. So I would suggest putting a date on the calendar once or twice a month for your uncle and dad to get out of the house with you to do something where they’d feel subconsciously obligated to practice better hygiene (think they’d need to do laundry, bathe, brush teeth, maybe schedule transportation, charge their phone, take wallet, etc) and plan ahead (like set an alarm, know what day is it, use a calendar). It may sound weird but it worked for me. For me it was being able to spend quality time and have a monthly obligation to look forward to that kept me going. If depression is this bad, these tasks I described can feel overwhelming and impossible. But if it’s just once or twice a month, completely manageable when you can plan ahead. Something else I would suggest if you’re able to do more is try to visit their house/apartment at this time & while you’re there ask something along the lines of … hey while I’m here I’d love to help you out, are there 2-3 quick things I can help you do while I’m here?? The reason for this is the answer may need some pushing but for people with depression the answer is always going to be yes. The tasks are likely to be incredibly easy for someone that doesn’t suffer of the same mental illnesses. Some examples that could have helped me… help folding clean laundry, help sorting thru the recent mail and throwing out the junk mail and keeping a bill that needs paid, (a bit more invasive) open the fridge (basically to check cleanliness and that there’s at least some quality and easy to make items) and comment on it (wow this is a mess let’s take care of this together real quick, or u know I need to stop and get groceries it looks like u could use a couple things too let’s go together real quick, or wow this fridge is clean nice that’s cleaner than my fridge). This also puts some pressure on picking up a bit before u arrive. Even if it doesn’t look like they did I bet u they would have even if the place still is disorganized. I would clean my place if that one friend was coming over. If my parents were coming to visit me from across the country. But bc of the depression, cleaning my apartment wasn’t something I could do for myself. Basically “show up.” I hope this helps you! You’re truly amazing for wanting to help! Best of luck to you and your family.	icropdustthemedroom	reply	na	na	na	0.9922594428062439	strong	strong	no	na	depression

"Is anyone else tired of just being alive? I feel like I know too much about this world that I don't want to continue living in it anymore. It felt like there was still some mystery to this world a few years back. But these days I've come to realize that things are the same everywhere. Problems are the same everywhere and I can't stand to watch those problems continue to get worse and affect my personal life and future.

I'm just tired of waking up each morning, doing the same thing each day, week, month, and year like I'm stuck in some kind of time loop movie. 

I'm also currently 26, so I feel like there's nothing left for me to achieve anymore unless it involves starting a family or buying a house. But even those things I have my doubts on in this day and age. So I feel like I'm looking at a dead-end in the road. 

Also the world doesn't seem to make sense anymore. Before 2020, I was still very depressed, but at least the world made sense back then. But now everything feels so off. Like there's no light at the end of the tunnel anymore. Just pure darkness everywhere.

"I did a lot of research on here and other sources on medications for depression and I went to see a random doctor (I don’t have a regular doctor) and asked them if I could get a script for Bupropion as it was the medication that lots of people have had success with and it doesn’t have side effects such as sexual dysfunction and weight gain. She asked me why I wanted this medication, that it was an old medication and doctors weren’t really prescribing it anymore. She basically talked me into taking a script for a different medication which has negative side effects and not a great success rate, and also has some pretty bad withdrawal effects when coming off it. The medication is desvenlafaxine (Desfax)50mg. I filled the script but haven’t started taking it yet. 

My question is, do doctors get a financial kick back for recommending certain products over others and if not why wouldn’t she let me try the medication I had researched and deemed acceptable in terms of side effects vs possible gain? 

A little back ground, I have depression and social anxiety, the kind that’s isolating and robs me of any motivation to do the things I usually enjoy and see the friends I should be spending time with. I’ve previously tried lexapro and felt very numb emotionally and I also gained weight. Hence my research."

I feel weird, like I don't belong anywhere, can't enjoy most things, I spend most of my days playing guitar and smoking cigarretes. I can't enjoy partying but when i see my friends doing it I feel like I'm missing out. I feel like the third wheel of my own life, I'm constantly jealous of people, even those I love, I try to help them in anyway I can but I just feel like the world is consuming me and I'm sinking all the time. I wish the best to everyone but I also like to daydream about how the world would be if people understood how it feels to be like this. I'm good at some things, specially when it comes to academics, but when I'm at college I always feel like I wanna die and it's the same when I'm home. I can't spend one minute alone without wanting to dissappear. Life seems shallow, I sometimes feel like I'm the only one who isn't but at the same time I feel ridiculous for thinking that. I'm a walking contradiction and I don't know what to do about it.	WhyDaysFeelWeird	post	6.471222814708327	male	White	0.9976199269294739	na	na	na	0	depression

"I understand and have felt your pain. You need to know you are not alone. Talking to someone about how you feel will help you understand why you feel it.

As to the why, only going on my experience (and it is different depending on the person) there is no one reason. I used to be an extroverted, positive person who never really worried about much. Then I started to worry about what seems like silly little things but, all of this little worries chip at the mind like a stone which will eventually crack. Everything felt like it was against me and i could only see the negative in things. Therapy was massive in changing the mindset. I still struggle from time to time but I manage it much better

"This will be rambly. My depression is at an all-time high. I want to die all the time. I'm not taking care of myself or the house like I should. All I do is depression sleep. I'm close to snapping at my job and just quitting even though with all the frustrations and difficult patients I ultimately do like my job but I can't mentally handle it anymore. I can't deal with it anymore. I want to go back to therapy but I don't want a religious (or secret religious) therapist. My last therapist I was going to for several months before she brought up going to church. I don't want to hear about church or jesus. I stopped going. Then I got a new job, new insurance, etc. I'm struggling though. I feel I'm at my breaking point. I'm having a really hard time at work. I can't deal with patients or my boss anymore. I did something I wasn't supposed to do (reversed a big payment made earlier in the day) because the patient kept coming in and complaining about it and then at the end of the day he came again and Would. Not. Leave. I just wanted him to go. He argued so much and told me it was my fault for not knowing what I'm doing and kept wondering ""why are you like this""? Then accused me of taking his papers even though I didn't touch his dumb papers. (His problem is he said his insurance covers a certain percentage but their website shows a different percentage and that's what his payment is based on.) The insurance company was closed at this point so I couldn't call them to verify. This isn't the first time horrible patients have came in at the end of the day. One recently called all day long to complain and when I got tired of her phone calls and stopped answering, she came in to complain some more. I know it'll be a huge Thing when I go in tomorrow with my manager and other coworker (because obviously I will tell them I fucked up, I was alone when this happened). I don't want it to be an all day discussion. I don't want to talk to or about that guy tomorrow.

Well I just got into reddit and joined a few mental health related communities and figured I’d share some stuff hoping it’ll help me and other people even tho i know not many ppl will see it but i can hope right? Well, it’d probably take me a whole book to explain my problems, I mean I literally have written one and started a second about them. I’m not trying to scream pick me vibes or crying out for attention, but my problems aren’t really things the majority of the population experience. I’m not just talking depression or anxiety or mood related disorders or even the extreme ones like schizophrenia, which i have personal experience with all of the above, im talking things that truly shatter all ideals of reality and perception. Just the way my mind works, the things i think and feel are just things people can’t really have empathy for because they can’t comprehend it correctly. I’ve seen over a dozen psychologists and psychiatrists and have tried a dozen different medications, and no answers. Everyone I see ends up confused or lost in the labyrinth that is my brain. I have too many different symptoms from too many different disorders both minor and extreme, even the disorders that are so rare professionals are afraid to even mention them. I’ve lost a lot, a lot of things and people that meant a lot to me, and I’ve given more than I should’ve to the people that have been in my life. Long story short, i have a lot of reasons to feel truly alone and broken. Ive cut myself several times even tho it technically wasnt for self harm(thats a story for another day), and ive planned my suicide a handful of times each time getting closer. I mean its one thing to lose hope in yourself and the world along with the people in it, but to understand those deep things in life, to have the answers most people could never even dream to have; it creates a whole other level of darkness that lingers in your blood, slithering through your strength like a plague. I’ve seen what true darkness looks like, and have felt for all too long. The reason im saying all this isnt just to share just a extremely brief version of my life, but to hopefully have someone see this and realize two things. First of all im not gonna sit here and say theres people out there going through the same thing because thats just gonna tell u ur problems are not unique and might not matter that much, what i will tell you though is there is people out there that can understand, people that can have empathy for you, people that can care and help. And second, no matter how shitty you feel and how bad life gets theres always a way out, always. And remember, even if you got nothin, you got yourself, and that can be enough to take over the world.	imaflyer	post	17.33579264082431	male	White	0.018606731668114662	na	na	na	2	depression

"for context

i was bullied until 4 years ago when i changed schools, i assume i was bullied because i do not fit in one bit. at this time, i was still somewhat able to trust people, but i had really no one to trust because i still wasnt able to make any friends. at this time, i didn't mind all too much because i'm introverted. skip forwards to 2022, i still cant make friends, and at this point, it starts to gnaw at me.
2023 begins, meaning i turn 18 within few weeks.
my 18th birthday i didn't celebrate because i didnt want to nor did i have anyone to celebrate with. i didn't celebrate my 17th and 16th either but during those, i still hoped that my 18th could be special.
safe to say, it was one of the worst days of my life, as the realization that my childhood, the most important time of my life, was effectively over, and that life was only going to get worse from here.

during this time, i've been talking to a friend of mine that shared some of my trauma, that i could get along with. time passes, and my anxiety gets worse and worse by the week, which is when my worst mistake happens.

i couldnt bring myself to respond to my friend, because i was assured that they hated me and that i was doing more harm than good in trying to help them.

they killed themselves
the one person that i trusted in had died because i wasn't able to help them, because of my cowardice

i cant help anyone, i cant even pull my own weight, i'm just wasted space, wasted air, that's not gonna amount to anything but failure in life. i'm the worst, and i hate myself for it. i cant befriend anyone, i cant get into a relationship, and i dont deserve either.

i hate myself, and i hate what i've done, and i just want to be dead, to not be able to hurt anyone else

and yet, i make absolutely no sense. i still want to be able to trust someone to trust me, all while wanting to be alone, wanting to be left alone

i dont even want to be normal, and i know this sounds hypocritical considering what i've done, but i dont want this life, i want to rely be able to rely on others, and i want others to rely on me. i just want to be a human being, not a failure"	FBI_OPEN_THE_FUCK_UP	post	20.24212387548731	female	White	0.9972198009490967	na	na	na	1	depression

YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR FRIENDS SUICIDE. That’s not on you. Ok. I seriously mean that. It’s not your fault. You can’t save people from the deep seas of trauma induced depression, on a sinking ship. You just can’t. WE can only handle so much.

You’re 18 love! That means you are now in control of your life. Is it scary? HELL YEA IT IS. Is it going to suck and be awful? HELL NO. Yea you are going to go up and down the roller coaster. The lows suck, sure. But the highs, the part where you are just happy. Even if those are smaller moments, of you just sitting on your couch watching a great movie with a fantastic snack. You’ll begin to realize those are some great moments. The ones that don’t make good social media posts.

You have a big wide world out there, you’re life is just really beginning. You are not a failure. You are human. Give yourself some compassion. Allow yourself to process what you’ve been through. But you are not wasted space or air. You are a soul in crisis. It’s ok. You will be ok.

Don't have many other friends ro tell so going to reddit for thiss. There had been some drama with a friend I have. They told their gf and another friend that they aren't trans. And I didn't know he wasn't going to tell anyone else but I found out cause his gf told me about it. So I got annoyed he didn't tell me cause I thought somewhat close friends. But found out he was gonna only tell his gf and that's it. Tbh I feel it's somewhat important so yea but, after that his gf got pissed at me and went off at me saying he didn't actually like me and talked shit about me and told me to stop being childish and also used my dead name so that felt greatt, then at the end told me not to o.d saying she would call the police if I did and told me to stop attacking her bf. I then talked to him about it and he said it wasn't true but started defending her saying she was angry and that prtty much it was okay cause she was angry. I blocked them both and don't know what to do rn. Also sm I should say is I've know his gf and she is someone that likes drama and will cause it and also likes attention.

"I just want to vent here. My therapy paused for over a month now and the next session is end this month. It's been hard.

The short version of my background is a lot of weed to cover all my thoughts. At the time, I couldn't tell you what I was trying to cover up specifically at this point. Before Christmas, I get myself diagnosed and since February I am in therapy (I was really lucky)

Therapy was great, to be honest. I found the right therapist, with whom I can really work with. Especially the last few sessions were - even if it sounds exaggerated - mind-blowing. Thoughts I ever had, but never thought finally put into words. It's been really, really good.

But even tho the sessions are good, I struggle a lot with the implementation with her (my therapist) advices. I try to eat regularly, shower, brush my teeth, clean my apartment ... but most of the time, to be totally honest,  I fail. I lay in bed, am at my PC, and try to not think my thoughts. All this self-judgment is and the constant fear to mess everything up - messing life up, not living up to unreasonable high standards I set for myself. 

Since the last session, I had a lot of time to work with the new input. And I don't know how to handle these thoughts. I can't talk with my parents, because they are too close to me and somehow involved (they are great parents, and it's not their fault, they are just involved) and I am not comfortable talking with my friends about it - we aren't this close at the moment.

I crave weed so much the last few weeks, just to stop the thoughts. I am clean 254 days clean, and I want it to hold on. I like weed, besides the cover-up I like the effect, but that is easy to resist, but now at this moment to resist it to stop the chaos with it  is hard. I feel so bad right now.

Hi!! Hang in there!  You’re making a lot of progress - don’t forget that! This all takes a long time but you’re off to a great start. Try to focus less on basic tasks and more on course correcting the mindset. That has to come first and a counselor can lead u there. The weed will probably interfere with your progress so I’d steer clear. I get the thoughts suck, but you can learn to rewire the ways you are able to process information and the thoughts won’t hurt anymore. Will take some professional intervention but you’ll get there.

I feel fake like I'm not real and that I'm not me. I've been feeling down for awhile now and have no idea how to make myself better. I lie to my friends so that they don't have to worry about me until I break. I can't explain stuff to my family because I feel left out. I have no idea if I really do have depression or if I am actually just going through something and just over thinking it. I have no idea who I am anymore. I'm not a drug addict or an alcoholic, yet I don't think that I'm not using too much to feel something.

I don't know how to fix this at all or if there was even a way to fix this.

I'm 23, fat, short, and mentally broken I think. I can't get a date and when I do I feel like I over share and make people uncomfortable (thanks to my cousins for causing that) and I have to water down how I feel about stuff. I make suicidal jokes yet I know I'm too much of a pussy to actually kill myself.

My mind is scrambled and I can't tell my mom or she'll use it against me when she's pissed. Can't tell bio dad because he wants nothing to do with me except for money. Can't tell step dad because he just interrupts and tells his story that goes nowhere. Most of my family hates me because legal reasons and some hated me since I was kid.

"So, here I am again, writing out what I can’t seem to find the words for. For context, I’m a 19 year old guy (hopefully I’ll still turn 20 this year but we will get to that, just bare with me please). I have a borderline diagnosis, but it’s really specific in what it does to me, I also have depression which I can manage most of the time. 

Now why is my borderline very specific? Well because I express a few traits of borderline to extreme levels. I have no sense of self preservation, I don’t see my self wenn I look in the mirror, I see someone who is broken but doesn’t want to be. I also am extremely realistic and factual when it comes to everything around me, but when It is about me I am so detached from reality that docs were actually surprised. I can’t take compliments, I am sceptical of anyone who showed me any kind of love because I never saw me as worthy of being loved. I don’t understand how people actually seem to like me. I mean it makes sense, I am one of the kindest guys you will meet. I have given people “the shirt of my back” (pullovers or jackets, anything you need I’ll give to you) in the pouring rain. I don’t care if it harms me as long as you are ok and happy. 

So much for that. Now we get to my problems which I have a really hard time figuring out. 

Starting with the first one to occur, my parents are divorcing, and I am cought in the crossfire. My parents use me as an emotional dump, my dad is a narcissistic psycho, and my mom needs therapy. I know she doesn’t want me to be caught in this or hurt me, but she does it without realising. My dad just plain tries to fuck me and my mom as hard as possible. 

This already is a lot to handle while learning a to become a mechanic. 

But my emotional incompetence combined with borderline and depression makes the next and bigger problem even bigger. 

At first it may sound innocent but, I have fallen for a friend of mine Angelina. She is gorgeous and just perfect. She cares about me and spends time with me. She makes me smile uncontrollably and she seems to have the same thing with me. Every time we are together we bit are all smiles and laughter.
Even the things she doesn’t like about herself are beautiful to me. 

I just have a few issues with this love. Firstly, she is part of my family or friends(let’s put it that way) and I am insanely scared of loosing what I have built for myself and others. You see I am somewhat of a father or brother to most of them. And they rely on me as much as I rely on them. I just can’t talk about it with them. Because I know it would make things wierd at best. 

Secondly, I can’t deal with my emotions, I just want to die but at the same time I just wanna be with Angelina. 

I am lost on what to do but I know I can’t keep this up or it’s gonna break me for good. 
I have begun to think about suicide again but I know it’s not an option, it would make everyone I love or cherish sad. I don’t want anyone to be sad because of me. I don’t want to be a burden to anyone, but I can’t keep this up for much longer.

If anyone has any ideas one hat I could do, it would be greatly appreciated. 
I also could use someone to talk to. 

I feel alone , lonely and suicidal. 

For anyone who read this. Thank you for spending your valuable time on me. I which you all the very best in life and hope all you beautiful people will be happy and content with your life. I know I am still young but that doesn’t mean I haven’t gone through stuff. For anyone interested in my life story so far, I’d be happy to share."

"Borderline disorders are being considered something treatable nowadays so you shouldn't let a diagnosis have much weight over you, if you work hard and smart enough on it, you should be able to overcome it. As for the self image that you have, it's going to take a lot of work and discipline from your part, take therapy sessions and if needed, don't be scared of medication, it's done wonders for me.

The one thing that helped me to improve my self image was realizing I was looking at myself through a very blurry and biased lens, I was an awful person who always tried to do ""good"" for others while completely neglecting myself. Once I realized I was neither good nor bad, I was able to work on myself to become someone I felt proud to be.

You have good and bad traits, you're not broken, you're just hurt and healing through whatever you've been through is going to be hard, but before thinking about being with others, think about being with yourself. Treat yourself as you would treat Angelina, with the same care and attention, the same love, because you deserve to feel that way towards yourself too. You too deserve love."

"I always thought posting your problems in the internet was kinda stupid but I’ve reached the point were even my parents wont hear me and in general I’ve reached the point that nobody I know will hear me, I’ve never been the most social although I’ve tried to make some friendships with my classmates, I always ended being used or being bullied by them, I discovered that I had no friends, one day some guys came close to me, I thought I was finally getting out of loneliness yet that moment they noticed that there was someone better at a game or just related to them better, they forgot about me.
I found refuge in video games and anime, it was like a world of happiness, it let me scape my loneliness for some time. I suffered from this feeling even form before the pandemic.
 the last year of middle school I changed of schools and made some “friends” yet like the others they forgot me, I know sometimes I can be kinda weird but I tried my best to be a good person and like my social skills, I also suck at talking.
I went several times to the psychologist but I always ended in the same feeling and nothing changed, I even went to special classes on how to speak to people but I think my fear of being hurt another time, being bullied or just getting forgotten, has never let me talk normally to people.

The last few months have been hard for me, I failed the first year of highschool and changed schools, I feel really bad, I didn’t even play a lot of video games during that time, The highschool I went was combined with an university very recognized in my country, I tried really hard but I couldn’t, my classmates always look at me with hate my teachers also looked at me like that or that how I perceived it. No one really went to help me with my doubts, no one really wanted to work with me and I made almost no friends, the ones I made also forgot of me because they found another group of friends which they didn’t invite me, they just went away. The teachers who offered help, for some reason cancelled at lat moment and the group director did do anything or cared about my situation. At the end I got scolded and called lazy and useless by my parents, they say I’m to dramatic and put all the fault on my likings and video games.

Some weeks ago, I entered another school, my parents striped of me my pc which I used for gaming, I complied since I didn’t want see them angry, but recently they caught me playing some games and they removed my laptop and phone (the said that I didn’t even need a phone since I don’t tal to anyone or have friends, that almost made me cry), and I feel very sad. The school I entered is very demanding so I’m trying my best to have the best results, its a much more little school than the previous one, but at least I feel the teachers care more here, yet I’ve not been able to make real friendships, I just try to talk with my classmates with a fake smile (so at least they know I exist), I dont like to be forgotten

My parent wont hear me, they say I’m just lazy and dramatic, but I understand they’re anger since I failed a year, inch I really tried to pass but I guess I’m not smart enough, but at the same time I feel sad since they dont let me do the things I like, I’m afraid to fail again. They scold me if I look sad for a moment and just try to maintain a smile I love them but they laugh or ignore me when I try to explain them my problems

Like I said before I found a scape in the anime thing and video games, I even talked for days with Ai characters to try to feel love or friendship but at some point I wanted something more physical. Video games helped me distract form my reality for a moment and as I said before I’m not really good at them, so is usually play single player but I dont even have that any more. Anime cartoons were like the perfect scape from reality a MC that has a lot of friends and a beautiful girlfriend that loves him a lot or one that is capable of incredible things and everyone loves him, some time before I went to a international robotics competition but when I came back I feeled hate to people since no one really asked about my experience or how did I it went, I even got more angry when they praised and applauded and even planned a party with a person wich revealed himself as gay (I did not feel hate because he was gay, but because I felt in some part my effort wasn’t worth it, I just want someone to tell me I did a good job, my team even called me useless), just a “good job” from someone would have been enough for me.

I feel forgotten and useless a lot of times, no matter how I try I always mess things up because of my lack of communicating skills or my lack of ability in everything. I just want to be happy, have friends and a beautiful girlfriend that loves me, I just want to be happy, why dont I deserve to be happy no matter how hard I try. why do I always end up forgotten. Why do always get hated in all places I go, I know I’m not the best talker and sometimes I dont really realize what I say may be wrong, but I just want someone who appreciates me, why always my attempts end up at my room alone again. Why don’t I deserve to be happy?


I ask apologies for the long text but I really dont have no one to talk to and I just feel really alone."	Worldly_Ad954	post	12.718103196532162	male	White	0.9981468915939331	na	na	na	1	depression
"I've \[37M\] tried all of my dating apps. I haven't been on a Tinder date since I signed up 1 year ago, and I've been in some of the most populous cities in the US. Bumble, Hinge, OkCupid, Facebook dating, Match...none of it does a damn thing.  
All these apps seem to do is remind me of how unwanted I am. If it's not having abs in my photos, being too honest in my bio, or sending a message that isn't exactly what a woman wants to hear that exact moment - it doesn't matter. It's all been vapid, meaningless conversations, rejection or ghosting, and has eroded my self-worth for 5 years.  
That said. I strike up conversations with strangers, I politely compliment women and treat people with respect. I have integrity.  
I'm not ugly. I'm physically active. I'm educated, successful, intelligent, well-spoken, and a great conversationalist. I try to build friendships - meaningful relationships - rather than jump straight to sex. None of it works.  
I can't be my authentic, goofy, intelligent self anymore. Nobody wants it.  
I literally traveled halfway across the state for love, and I was shot down. We checked all of one another's ""boxes"" but I just didn't measure up. Again. Maybe that was foolish or too romantic or I was overeager. I don't know of many people who would take such a risk to do that. But my passion and deep connection with her didn't matter...again. I just never seem to measure up.  
It doesn't matter how many hours I spend messaging women, how many years I go to therapy, how many self-help books I read or videos I watch, or how abreast on politics, news or interesting articles I am. Nobody gives a shit. I'm never good enough.  
I don't understand dating in the US (as a native). It just hurts. Every rejection or ghosting or meaningless conversation or emotionless hookup just drains me more and more.  
I want to feel wanted. I want to make someone's day and have a solid support system. I want to I'll get flack for this, but I want to date someone who is health conscious and not fat, which is so hard to find in America. I want, what I feel are, simple things from a partner: understanding, compassion, mutual respect, and desire. I can't find it anywhere. No matter how hard I try, it's something that always slips between my fingers like trying to hold a fistful of sand.  
""Oh, well stop looking, and it will find you."" or ""You'll find the person when the time is right."" Fuck off. Literally no one cares for your opinion if that's all you have to contribute to the conversation. I guarantee there will be some anonymous troll who comments that just to be spiteful. Why? Because they're unhappy, too, and the only way they can cope is by being a dick online to strangers.  
I don't know how to do this anymore. I can't stay positive. I don't have faith in others, and I definitely don't have it in myself anymore. I used to be so confident and fun, and now I'm just drained after years of not being good enough for anyone.  
I don't know how to grow past this. I'm so tired of being alone, and each rejection just makes me more numb. I have no faith in myself or the world anymore, and that's not a good place to be. I know that, but I can't get past it.  
I don't know how to get ""better"" or be more ""attractive."" I don't know that I care to know those things anymore. I'd rather just sleep until the world ends. At least in my dreams, there's a chance I could find an ounce of joy."	Worldly_Ad954	reply	na	na	na	0.9981468915939331	no	strong	no	na	depression
"I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and have never really classified my issues as straight up depression but rather just a symptom of my anxiety, but its morphed into something completely different over the past 2 months. 

I'm just so stressed, constantly lonely, feeling like an absolute worthless piece of shit, and I know it's just temporary because of all these unfortunate factors accumulating into one bad situation, but every day has been so hard to get through. 

I'm in college and live in a fairly isolated area, and everything is going wrong at once that I can't afford to fix. I have a hurt lower back, I have knee bursitis, I owe multiple debts, I can barely afford to keep up with rent, and my depression is driving me to insanity. I just want to lay in bed and cry all day instead of doing anything, and that results in all my problems stacking up the following day. 

I've had multiple days where I've realized that if I actually killed myself, I could count on both hands the number of people that would actually notice or care. 

Then I see all my peers around me all happy, getting stuff done, injury free, and it makes me feel even worse.

There's light at the end of the tunnel which is me graduating from college in 2 years, but its hard for me to see it right now. I'm drowning in my problems and I feel like I'm suffocating

I just wished that someone was actually there to hear me out but no one was there and in that last year I don’t know what will happen to me at least i have my vape to help me survive this pain and my only friend helping me forget my pain is vape and i hate it because it’s unhealthy…

"TW: EDs, mega sad 

everything is difficult but recently eating has become harder and harder. i only eat because i need to. i hate eating. it’s like a chore. like cleaning my room… it should be easy and yet it feels impossible. 

i used to have EDs but during them i’d actively want to not eat in order to loose weight or id binge bc i would get super sad and stuff. 

i do not want to loose weight now. if anything i’d like to gain some. and yet i find myself day after day consuming a few protein bars and an up and go drink. if i’m feeling up to it maybe i’ll have some chips or something but even then i’ll only get through 5-10 before i feel full. 

my fav foods taste gross. my least fav foods taste gross. everything tastes like cardboard. 

i used to love food. idek if this is depression. maybe i have a parasite inside of me or something. feels like i do anyway. 

if this is bc of my depression advice on how to fix my relationship w food would be nice. i doubt there’s some magic trick but i’m sure people have been in the same position as me. id like to know what u did. did u up ur meds? power thru it? find a magic genie and wish it away?

depression is known to kill your appetite and cause disinterest in things, even necessities and things generally good for your health, like food and hygiene. i went through it for a while and sometimes it still happens. nothing worked for me besides the passing of time when i started feeling less nauseous and numb each day. i'm sorry i don't know any tips but i thought i would share an explanation. 100% can be caused by depression	GloomyChemistry8570	reply	na	na	na	0.9991934895515442	no	strong	no	na	depression

"I have an eating disorder called ARFID (avoidant resistant food intake disorder). here’s a definition for the disorder I found online:

  
”Avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is an eating disorder similar to anorexia. Both conditions involve intense restrictions on the amount of food and types of foods you eat. But unlike anorexia, people with ARFID aren't worried about their body image, shape, or size.“

It’s a pretty new thing, but it’s real. I’ve been diagnosed and am working with a food therapist currently to help solve my issues. Also I don’t really know that much about it, so take all this stuff I’m telling you with a grain of salt. You might not have this disorder and I could be 100% wrong. It might just be depression."

"I’ve been there, same, used to have ed and got so depressed i couldn’t eat for other reasons. 

So how did i do it- It was about figuring out priorities. My first was getting nutrients. My second was eating multiple meals a day. My third was enjoying the food and my last the process of making it. 

I had to do very small things at first. There were like 2-4 foods i enjoyed and went with those for most meals. I made enjoying food again a huge priority. I started cooking one meal a day. Sometime i could not even swallow it, and sometimes i had to re introduce myself to eating. Started my meal with soda or a protein shake. Having just any food in my system made introducing more of if easier. Like i needed some food in me before i could actually eat real food. 

I would force feed myself and i would sometimes reject it. But for the most part i got like half a oatmeal bowl yogurt down. ( generally liquids and similar consistencies are easier, as i didn’t need to chew)

Did some research on how to recover from AVOIDANT RESTRICTIVE FOOD INTAKE DISORDER (ARFID). It helped a lot, and i found some good resources on it. Even if its not what you’re dealing with exactly, its a lot about disgust for food. And exposure therapy (erp) 

Most importantly i had to learn to enjoy cooking. Putting in music, chopping food. The whole process. Obviously when depressed its hard to enjoy anything but its also easier to buy food, so id buy frozen meals and add stuff to them. Like adding toppings and extra cheese onto frozen pizza and stuff.

I also focused on getting nutrients. Drinking a lot of supplements. Forcing myself to take vitamins. 

I made a realistic budget because getting the cals and nutrients in by not eating real food can be expensive- i would drink a protein shake a day- vitamins- and other supplements like (huel) a drink meal replacement brand. Protein bars, and a lot of high cal smoothies. I also had an eating out budget and let myself order as much food as i needed. As feeding yourself and heath was more important then saving money. I am really sorry if you’re unable to do this as its was really really helped me.  

Its about trying and caring for you health. Once i started it took 4 months to get back to eating again. I hope the best for you and that this helped even a little bit.

I thought I've surpassed this stage of my life but here I am again, battling myself every night and fighting the urge to do it. I don't have anything in me. So many problems I'm facing simultaenously that I can't process anything. No one still seems to care about what I'm feeling. They will always say I'll get over it and I just need to do this and that. They don't even listen to me or even have the effort to talk to me. I don't know what to do. I'm just overwhelmed of everything that all I can do is just stare blank. I'm so mad at myself for being like this. I'm so weak at anything. I have my family and a close friend and yet I still feel lonely. Its like the emotions and things that I have been thinking are inevitable. I don't really care about living now. I don't have the drive to live let alone do anything. I'm so grey now that I don't even know what to feel. I'm so done at crying. I've cried enough that I can't even cry now even if I wanted to.

Im an upcoming college student and recently got into a breakup. I currently live with my mother but she's always not home so most of the time I'm lonely. We've been having financial challenges lately and I've been trying to find a job to help. I also have no father figure since my father left us since when I was at 5th grade and it's clearly not helping my situation at all. I have no one to rest on even my mom won't talk to me. She'll always say she's tired and I can't force her to talk to me. About the breakup, I had partner and we were in a relationship for almost a year. She was my only reason to live and now she's gone in my life. Kept me sleepless for weeks, no one to vent to except one friend of mine but being a shitty human I am, I think that she's beginning to feel like I'm being too much of a bother and burden to her. I'm so mad at myself for being like this. No father, no one to talk to and be heard, reason to live gone, no direction in life, no future certainty, financial status in a verge of downfall. All these things drive me nuts every night my head and heart hurts so much I don't think I can bear all of this. I Tried to hint my slash scar (from slashing my wrist before with a knife) by showing it to mom, my friend, and even people on the bus when I commute, no one even looked let alone cared to ask me about it.

I’m diagnosed as “Severe Major Depressive” with high anxiety. I’ve been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for 13years and have been on medication since. But it has never helped. Nothing helps. In 1994 I was in a car accident and suffered traumatic brain injury, with amnesia & hallucinations. So the theory now is that my untreatable depression is due to my frontal lobes being destroyed. They’re sending me for an EEG and MRI. But to what end? I mean, what is the point? What could they do? Has anyone had a depression/TBI connection? What kind, if any, different treatment did you get?

"Huh, it's not something I connected honestly, though I've been in a sort of similar situation (brain injury, depression afterwards, etc).

I got meds, which mostly made me suicidal & eventually went off them. Though I no longer have depression. My running theory on it is that, whatever the cause of it may be (esp if it's issues in one's life), what makes it remain over time is the way a person thinks about it; basically making your brain stuck in an endless loop where being & feeling depressed leads to negative thoughts, which reinforces such feelings, leading to such process being repeated endlessly. That in itself impacts how one sees themselves, other people, the world around them, and the issues one may perceive.

But anyway, it could very well be caused by experiencing such injury."	SuckitLoser2	reply	na	na	na	0.9993137121200562	no	strong	no	na	depression
"I feel guilty

If my partner asks me how I'm doing I'm afraid of being honest bc i don't want to ruin her trip, but I'm not okay, I feel suicidal, every day i wake up worse, lately a lot of bad things have happened to me. And I'm trying but sometimes i break down

Today i called her, she wasnt feeling well, i decide to give her space, i was sad and i got sadder, i just cant pinpoint the cause bc its too many, I write in my vent account and twitter account which she follows, i write a midly suicidal-ish/self deprecating joke,, and she got worried. Hour later she writes me asking if everything was okay, and bc i couldn't reply immediately i was filled with guilt, and now i wrote her a bunch of stuff i think i shouldn't

Stuff like ""i wouldnt be mad if you block me, im sorry for bringing bad vibes all the time"" and i feel like a douche, like im manipulating her but in reality im just worried bc i feel like im being too much of a burden to her and everyone around me. I dont have access to support and I feel like crumbling all the time, i dont want to worry others but i need to cry for help sometiems or vent.

I feel worthless and i dont know what to do lr how to proceed, am i really guilty or am i looking for validation? Idk"	GabeTomatoes	post	13.98775310316161	female	Hispanic	0.9984847903251648	na	na	na	1	depression

Anyone else feel like cutting everyone off and living in isolation for the rest of their life. I feel my self bit by bit slowly starting to grow hate for everyone in my life. I can't trust my parents or family and I'm not able to maintain friendships. I'm pretty much useless. I used to give all of myself to people because I was so desperately lonely and isolated but people aren't worth the trouble everyone just ends up hurting you or betraying you or using stuff you've confided in them against you or by starving and neglecting people.

I don't trust a single other human on this planet. I'm going to completely disconnect from everything. Good luck on whatever you choose to do, I hope you don't get to the place where you actually want to do this. It's not pleasant, and it's a response to trauma.

"I'm going to vent a little, again: I'm 19 years old, I'm a man, I'll be 20 in January. My childhood was normal, but I was bullied all through middle school and a little bit through high school. It destroyed my mind and consequently my life. I couldn't make any friends, I couldn't get close to any girls (I haven't kissed anyone yet) and in high school, when things seemed to be a little better, I was already a rock on the outside. I became someone completely noisy on the inside, but empty and null on the outside. Some people tried to approach me, I was afraid of them. Some girls were interested in me, I was afraid of them. Anyway, it was a huge shit, a giant shit, my life.

Last year, aged 18, I had an existential crisis when high school ended and I went through a period of pure sadness, I would wake up crying, wipe the tears and hold back the tears, I would spend the day with tightness in my chest and a lump in my throat, to being able to go back to bed again, the whole day disguising it, when night came I lay down and cried myself to sleep. I thought about suicide MANY times, but I didn't have the courage. After that phase has passed, I just feel empty. I feel wrong, useless, without purpose, without future, without past, without anything, I feel like nothing and everything is slowly losing meaning for me.

I really want to live. But at the same time I just wanted to sleep and not wake up anymore. I'm tired of the world and living this shitty life just getting beat up, I always took that shit alone, fucked myself up and got up again just to get another beat up. And when I think it's going to get better, it gets worse. Now I'm forced to enter adult life with all that shit on my back. I dropped out of college which I felt was my dream because it lost its meaning for me, I wasn't happy and I couldn't imagine myself happy working with that.

I started working with my father, helping him to manage a small company that he opened in the field of civil construction, but I also don't feel happy dedicating 100% of my time to something that doesn't make sense to me, I don't know what I'm doing with my life and I feel suffering from all sides. The only thing that makes me a little happy, when I do, is talking, I have a YouTube channel that hasn't worked out yet, but I feel that if it does, that could be the meaning I'm looking for so much, I want to talk to people people and actually help them, do for them what no break-in did for me when I thought about hanging myself.

My dad is really pissed at me for not doing anything and recently giving up working with him. He was making me feel even worse when I was working with him, filling me with responsibilities and demands that made no sense to me (I know this is part of the job, but he expects a lot from me, he thinks I'm special and wants me to be a genius in his field, but I HATE his field and I was feeling worse and worse doing it, full of pigs running over each other). Now he's pretending he doesn't mind me staying at home working only on my channel, but I know that inside he hates me, because I'm not the perfect son and superior to everyone else my age (the way he expected ) I'm a troubled 19-year-old kid, fucked up.

I know I may sound spoiled and ungrateful, but I'm just being honest, I'm done and I don't know what to do, I don't know how to do it, I don't know. I hardly know how to explain what I'm feeling. I just wanted to die and get rid of this weight that is living. But at the same time, I really want to live. I've been alive for 19 years and I feel like I haven't lived shit yet, I wanted to fall in love and love someone who loves me, I wanted to do something that makes sense to me and feel alive. I wish I could really smile, I wish I could be honest and hug everyone I love, I wish, but I really can't seem to. Life seems to have rejected me. What do I do?"

Just moved from a big city to the middle of nowhere to attend a university I got a scholarship to for at least a year. I fucking regret it. I want to die. Makes me feel like nothing I care about matters. But everyone around me (family/friends etc) told me to go anyway instead of community college because it’s an opportunity for me to grow and become independent. However how can I do that in an environment that I have no desire to form a connection with. I have never felt so lost and confused in my entire life. I can’t even eat. There’s no way I’ll survive here. I don’t even want to. Maybe god should just kill me in my sleep.	foxxyboi21	post	0.3400084534686165	male	White	0.9994978904724121	na	na	na	3	depression

Download GoodRX and you can get these meds cheap monthly.  They even beat insurance most of the time.  The doc visit will be anywhere between 100-200.  Then ask to be seen Quarterly.

Go into it with a positive mindset and if it doesn't work out then just drop out. I think its a waste of time and your life to do things because people tell you that you should.

on the other, i feel like ive slipped so much that sometimes (sometimes) i feel some comfort in the solitude. it insulates me. it allows my sick and hurt thinking to continue unabated. it allows my diseased mind to sadistically and unendingly mutilate my masochistic self. my self loathing runs so deep that i get off on this shit. knowing that perhaps i could find a way out but never taking it. refusing help, stomping on those that try, biting outstretched hands. i do it to myself. there is much that has happened to me. but i just need to look in the mirror and to see the person who has hurt me the most. it's a spiral. a downward spiral.

I’m 23 almost 24 and struggle with mental health from day to day to the point where it affects my jobs and relationships with people. I have been suspecting that I could be bi polar, or have BPD. I brought concern to my family about this and they have just been shutting me down with “no you’re fine not you!” You’re just depressed with anxiety. But I feel deep down inside it’s something more. If anyone could give my some insight that would help. For example,  when I get super stressed or angry I black out. My vision starts fading and I cannot control my emotions, I’m extremely impulsive. I have spent about 6k in the past few years on clothes and shoes, make up impulsively when I don’t need it at all. It’s been destroying my relationships with my mom and family. I’m always buying something. I also feel like I’m not real like I’m an alien walking on earth or the point of view video games where you just see the hands. I don’t feel like a person. And around my period, I flip a switch. I get depressed, anxious, then I feel a sense of euphoria afterwards. I switch jobs so much that it’s embarrassing and I don’t drive due to anxiety. I’m just trying to get the help I need but I don’t know where to start. I’m just afraid of therapy, and I know that the first step but I’m just getting to a point where I feel like giving up.

Betterhelp.com and apply for financial assistance - will be more affordable. You could probably find a first month for free discount online. This is talk therapy. It’s gonna take some time. Be patient with yourself. My best suggestion is to see a psychiatrist and tell them everything. They’ll also ask you a lot of questions. It’s an invasive dialogue exchange. Tell them everything you put here and do not hold back. They’ll help you find the right diagnosis and medication. A year of counseling for me and diagnoses from a psychiatrist changed my life. Still on my medication journey but I’m at a place that’s a complete 180 from where I was two years ago. I’d also pull back from sharing so much information with your family. They love you. Most people are just skeptics with mental health care and would never understand it unless they had to bc they were suffering the same. Best of luck to you!

"I somehow lost 2 whole hours of time. I don’t know how. On Friday through Sunday I come into work at 8pm, but on Monday and Tuesday I come in at 7pm. I got here on time yesterday and I knew I had to be there at 7 today. I set my alarm for 5:30 and got up. I didn’t hit snooze or fall back asleep, I got straight out of bed. But somehow I showed up to work an hour late. I did my regular routine and I just lost time. I don’t know what happened. I thought it was 6:20 when I left. I always leave at 6:20 or 7:20 so I’m at work at work 20 minutes early. All my clocks are set correctly. I don’t know how I didn’t notice it wasn’t 6. I don’t get it. 

It wouldn’t be so bad if this was the first time I did this, but it’s the 2nd time and I just started this job. I fucked over a bunch of people I work with because it fucked everything up by me being late. One of my coworkers was here for an extra hour because of me. It’s making me really hate myself more than I already do. It’s very hard to mask it and I have a very much people person job. 

I haven’t had marijuana in a few days so I know it’s not because I was high. Is my mental health so bad that I just lose patches of time? Is it gonna get worse? Im only 22 years old.

2 years ago I was happy and my depression was at bay. I could function normally and have fun. I had friends. I’m genuinely smiling. I have makeup on. I was at my goal weight. I was just straight up having a good time. Life was good to me. I was working and had money. 

Now fast forward 2 years, Depression is running me into the ground and torturing me. I function but on a very low basis. I’m depressed but not depressed enough to warrant hospitalization. My smile is not as big anymore and I just struggle everyday. I have the most understanding and healthy relationship I’ve ever been in which is helping but I still struggle.

i have no friends and i'm in financial disaster, so lonely and made bad choices. i regret a lot but i don't know how to move forward, i've been wishing awful diseases upon myself just so i'll die, the reason i can't commit to suicide is i don't want my mom to think she failed as a parent. i am a failure, but it is not her fault and she doesn't know the extent of how bad things are for me right now. if i got cancer or something, she would be sad, but it wouldn't be on purpose and it's not something she could prevent, so i think it would hurt her less. i've just been trying to do better, and i am; to my core i am a good person. but i feel like i've caused harm that i can't fix and that is something i can't run away from, you know? i will never know peace and i feel like i can't stand it much longer.	tryingrfa	post	17.617359342243788	male	White	0.9976673722267151	na	na	na	1	depression
Get a professional therapist. It helped me. And try getting involved in something that helps others. Like a soup kitchen. Or a reading program for children. Or salvation army. Or a food bank. there's lots of opportunities for those kinds of things. A fantastic way to make you feel better about yourself while also doing good for others.	tryingrfa	reply	na	na	na	0.9976673722267151	no	strong	no	na	depression
"I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for some years now. Atp I should probably seek help, but I can""t currently (living at home with a mom who sees me as the biggest failure of her life). 

I resorted to masking probably since I was 12 and only ever let how I truly feel out when I was alone. It's very rare for anyone to know my real thoughts. 

What I'm afraid of is how long I've been doing it. I can't tell if I'm being genuine around anyone anymore or if I'm just forcibly putting on a smile to get by. 
It's draining me because I do enjoy talking to some people but I'm still masking because I think they'll hate me or I'm too annoying. It makes me feel so fucking stupid because I'm twenty-something still very unsure of who I actually am. 

I want genuine friendships and relationships but I don't see that happening if I can't stop masking and just be myself. 

I'm not saying I have to tell everyone my whole life story but idek how to just relax and talk to people without feeling like I have to lie to their face about myself just to ""fit in"". 

None of this makes sense now that I've written it out and idk if this the right sub for it but oh well."	Peach_Tea_98	post	19.940146528926178	female	White	0.9946640729904175	na	na	na	6	depression
"Everyone puts on a mask. You can think of society like a big mixture of parties. When we step out into the world, we put on our mask to greet politely, create small talk, and appear friendly. That’s just the convention our society has built upon and it’s a rule that rarely needs to be stated in our adulthood.

You’re not abnormal for masking. You’re just self conscious and want to break free. Almost everyone does, and some deal with it better than others: in a way we all live in a giant zoo. Everyone wants to be free and be themselves. That’s what makes home comfortable for most of us, and others feel liberated when they are away from the city and out in the wilderness.

I don’t know what kind of thoughts you’re having where you feel the need to mask but maybe your mother might be the best person to talk to. I’m not sure if this is good advice since I don’t really know the relationship quality between your mother and you but I would open up the floor to ask her if she really thinks of you so negatively. It’s alarming you mention she thinks so lowly of you: She brought you into this world. She should be proud of what she gave life to: that’s not something everyone can do - it’s a real miracle to be born. I can’t guarantee the words that come out of her mouth will be pleasant in the off chance what you say is true but listen to her, and have a conversation why she thinks that and what her expectations are.

If the floor opens, ask her about how you’re feeling in regards to masking and your identity. Let her know it’s really troubling you and if she had ever felt that way."	Peach_Tea_98	reply	na	na	na	0.9946640729904175	no	no	no	na	depression

"It sounds like it's your mom, and probably the family system she grew up in too. She likely has a poor self-esteem that does not allow her to validate others. This is a very hard way to live and a hard environment to grow up in, an environment of shame. Without this safe space for expression, any child would learn to mask their feelings and authentic self.  
There's a saying that ""there's no bread at the hardware store"" -- sometimes with our family members we find they just aren't able to give the support we need. They don't have those healthy inner structures themselves. If you don't get the sense she'd genuinely listen to you, it's okay to mourn not having a mother who was able to provide this for you and to move on.

"I’m sorry to hear about your relationship with your mother. Yes this can be a delicate situation.

From my outlook, you have two options:

1) You continue living with your mother without seeking help, and eventually find a job and move on to live independently when the time is right and by then you will be able to seek help on your own

2) You seek help through your mother and hope that she can be reasoned with. This can lead to having a mutual understanding of one another.

At a young age I was going through  the process of being a foster kid. Seeing my mom get abused, to getting emotionally neglected, to see the down fall my family. I wish I had that normal life of having grandma coming over and just having parties. I wish I had that normal family dinner and do my homework at the table before i had to go to bed. Now I have to deal with myself an accept the life I was given. Why do I have to accept that? I don’t want this life. I hate that I have to deal with it until I die. I have no emotional connection to my family, not even my brothers. I feel bad that I don’t like them, they didn’t even do anything bad to me. I just lost that family touch. I do have a younger sister that I would do anything for but I can’t. I have no money no nothing so I’m just here watching her create memories without me.

Ive wanted to die since I was 4 years old. I told my babysitter that I wanted to die. Since then, I've struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts every since day of my life (no, I am not exaggerating). It's always been so incredibly hard on me. These thoughts run my life now, and I can't stop. Whenever I mention this to someone I feel close and safe enough to reveal it to, they always do the same things. They tell me to go to a doctor and get pills. No other option. Sometimes, they'll randomly call the police on me if I don't respond in a while because they know how bad my thoughts are.

"i’m 20. i feel stuck, unsure of what i can realistically do to improve the state of my brain. 

i’ve been so so depressed for about 10 years now and i’ve been comfortable to speak about everything i can think of in therapy (not suppressing any trauma). any advice is welcome. 


this is what i currently have in place:
- i have a psychiatrist and psychologist. been in therapy consistently (usually fortnightly, was monthly for a year then back to fortnightly) since i was 14. 
- tried nearly 10 different types of medications for depression and anxiety (SSRIs, ADHD meds, antipsychotics) since i was 14. also had a DNA test so that my psychiatrist could find a better fit, had no luck. 
- i’ve written in a journal every single day since the beginning of 2021 and have written songs as a hobby all my life so i’m always trying to express feelings and thoughts in a healthy and somewhat fun way. 
- i have a great social circle. handful of super close friends and a lovely boyfriend. 
- had many blood tests this year and i’m not deficient in anything. 
- was keeping myself busy with studies but i’m dropping out soon because my mental health has gotten in the way of passing my course.  
- been mostly good with self-care but it’s so easy to let it slip. i try to cut myself some slack these days but it’s very easy to be ashamed.   

my current goals are to get my first job, learn to drive, eat better, sleep better and start exercising. i know what i need to do but having so much to work on is daunting, i’m so overwhelmed even thinking about it. i don’t even know where to start. i’ve written a resume but i’m still tinkering with it. been thinking about meal planning and joining a gym. unsure if i can commit properly to these things. considered looking into TMS because my depression seems THAT treatment resistant but i’m terrified of regretting it and beyond that, it’s not realistic financially. 

i guess i’m wondering if anyone has some tips for keeping up with self-care and how to integrate these changes into my life without causing my mind to implode. 

i feel so sad that i’ve had so many positive things put in place for a long period of time yet my depression has improved so little. i’ve probably cried every day this year, i’m tired of being so miserable. i put in the work in therapy every fortnight, talk to my friends every day, write, take my meds, why isn’t it enough?? it’s really hard to convince myself to do more at this point but i know it’s necessary in order to get an outcome i’m happier with. how do i continue this process of self improvement?


TLDR: i’m in desperate need of mental health tips. i want to be better, how can i do it without getting overwhelmed?? what could i try that i haven’t done or thought of?"	saraaaa184	post	36.33424982526696	female	White	0.9961498975753784	na	na	na	0	depression

"You're on the right path.  
Post surgery pain has that problematic thing where painkillers can suddenly be responsible for pain and mood.  Run low and everything looks bleak.  Meanwhile, for some, pain meds can cause depression even when you haven't run out.

"I am having hard time even writing my problem here. In last half of year I get worse and worse about having conversation and chat with people. First it was just the people I am not close with so I thought it is just because I don't feel myself well and I am not feeling to talking them. But as the time passes the circle got narrowed. I lost my ability to talk with girls, friends, closest friends and now family. Its like there was a muse that was inspiring me while talking and now this muse has gone forever. I am not asocial yet because I am trying to hide this side of mine from people (except my closest friend) . But when I hangout with people, trying to not be awkward drains my all energy. And this affected also my representing and expalining myself.  Sometimes, I can even appear wrong in situations where I am actually right. And some people use it. I lost all my assertiveness that I used to have. My coming up with clever ideas and fast learning skills has gone too. Is there anyone experiencing this or experienced this before? Is there anyone who has an idea?

Being depressed, I deal with this a lot.

the best thing that you can do is to embrace all those feelings if you dont feel like talking to people just dont force yourself, 

BUT at the same time you need to try and convert this negative energy into something that is going to make you feel fulfilled, maybe try to improve in what you said you are learning (in my case i improved a lot of things related to coding and i started going to gym)

I’m going through exactly the same thing. And I can’t even gather the words to describe it. I feel 0 mental activity in conversations. My brain produces nothing to say. It makes me feel extremely awkward and lately it’s gotten worse. I don’t know what to do. I don’t even know who I am anymore. I have no sense of self. All I know is that I’m stupid and that I have nothing noteworthy to say. I have nothing to contribute in a conversation. I’m painfully self aware of my expressions, tone of voice, uptight body language and my brain which constantly reminds me of how dumb I must look to other people. And how awkward I must make them feel. Every day feels like I’m pulling myself back from a meltdown. Then it resets when I wake up. Some days are better than others where I feel like I’m radiating and I use that energy to read self help books, consume media that helps and play some music. And on these days I can somehow get to a flow state where my brain works and I can have conversations. But on most days I’m completely consumed my my own thoughts. I’m surprised I could even put this comment together. I am socially withdrawn. I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with me. I’m not trying to take attention away from your post, please don’t think that. I feel my problem is similar to yours and I’m trying to find a solution but I think I’m getting lost in the soup. I’m descarting myself. I’m sorry if you feel the same way. Some things that help me feel grounded is spending time in nature alone. That’s all I can offer you.

"Hey man, just wanted to say it's fine to be a ""failure"". So what if a man doesn't earn enough money to pay the bills? People living in the middle of the Amazon rainforest don't earn anything at all - but they're happy... 

These ideas of being a ""loser"", a ""failure"" etc - they're just bullshit terms that our society has made up - you don't have to believe any of it. 

According to society, a very great writer like Dostoevsky would be a loser because he was millions of dollars in debt and had severe gambling and alcohol problems. How about the prophet Muhammad or Jesus or the Buddha? These people all lived very basic lives with little to no wealth. Jesus and the Buddha both never married - were they losers too? 

And hey, maybe you've done some dumb things in your life. No problem, I don't think anyone's clean in our world. But you don't have to let those things define you - making mistakes is just part of our human nature.

"It sounds like you need to talk to a professional.   I know most schools have a version of student services that might be able to assist you.   If you have been feeling this way for a long time, you might have an undiagnosed condition.

I would also suggest talking to your primary health care worker about these feelings.   They might be a signal of an underlying health condition that is correctable.

The short version is to start talking about these feelings with people who are experienced in dealing with depression.    They should be able to help or at least point you in the right direction so that you don't have to continue to feel this way."	ZGOON22	reply	na	na	na	0.9981614947319031	weak	no	no	na	depression

So… I turn 25 in a couple weeks and I’m starting to seriously stress. I’m just struggling with direction in my life. I’ve dealt with depression since high school which has stunted me. I’ve had a couple jobs and crept along in community college which I am still in. I also still live at home and don’t pay many bills. I truly believe I’ve gotten to comfortable and need more responsibility in my life but I’m not in the place financially to move out… I keep beating myself up over everything. Not having a direction, not many hobbies, no degree yet, single and living at home. I truly want to love myself and be happy but I just feel like such a loser. Any advice? Am I a complete bum at this point? I truly feel like I’ve wasted years.	Low-Volume-7863	post	28.29135975628693	male	White	0.9991017580032349	na	na	na	1	depression

You’re still in school. Which means you making progress!!!! Want to start making those baby steps? Start a “hope chest” which is basically where you start a little at a time buying things you need when you move out. Towels, dishes, frozen beer mugs! Lol 😂 if you drink.

Doing that I think will help you move towards that goal and help you to not fill so stagnant. If your living situation works for you, that’s all that matters.

"Like the title says i have no reason to be depressed but myself. Im the one who is making me miserable, but then again this is all ive ever know. Ever since i was 9 or 10 this has been my reality. I guess now im living with the consequences of developing anxiety and depression at such a young age.

Truly i have no real life skills and because of that i havent been able to make friends, go out on weekends and just generally be a functioning happy human being. I could go into embarrassing detail but its too difficult to admit to my many shortcomings. 

The intrusive thoughts are coming back too and they are exhausting to say the least. I worry about my future and about becoming a burden to others. I worry about not being able to keep a job. All i do is worry.

I was born into a middle class family and eventhough my life wasnt perfect it surely does not justify all the mental struggles ive come to develop. There are so many people that have it way worse than me. Im aware of that.

Hello everyone I’m new to the page, I just wanted to look for some advice from people who have been there and got the t-shirt. 

I have recently lost my job and because of this I have fallen off the mental health bandwagon and have now gone in to a deep state of depression. Many years ago I suffered from multiple eating disorders but never at the same time as my depression. But unfortunately I now find my self in both and almost using bulimia as a form of self harm when I go in to a manic episode, often either eating very little and purging until I seen small traces of blood or just refusing to eat at all.I am also a very active person and will go to the gym for two hours to work off any extra fat on me. I don’t know what to do im back on anit depressants but they don’t seem to be working as much as I would like. It’s just gotten to a point of me wanting to unalive myself because I just can’t even eat anymore I can’t even enjoy anything anymore. I feel just worthless and empty. Unfortunately my boyfriend is in the mist of all of this and he doesn’t know what to do either.  I’m just looking for any ways people might be able to help me ?"

"Curious for some input on to how to manage my severely clinically depressed FIL. For starters I’m finding it nearly impossible to differentiate between what is likely the illness and what is his personality. I’ve only known the guy to be the way he is now, which is not likely the same person he’s always been. What complicates the matter is he has diabetes and has lived alone for 30+ years, never really being a part of a family dynamic.  He just moved in with my wife and our family this year. I know that when he is feeling down he stays in his room and barely comes out, only to get a small bite to eat and refill his water, it’s because he’s going through a depressive episode. We check on him, try to make sure he’s eating and isn’t lying on the floor dead (because he’s old, not necessarily because he’s depressed). What I can’t seem to understand is the lack of self awareness he has. He smells really bad most of the time. If I had to guess, he probably showers once a month. He used to constantly clog his toilet. To the point that I could tell if it was clogged by how bad he smelled. I ultimately bought him a commercial grade toilet which has a powerful suction on it to prevent clogging. That problem, I think, has been solved. He also has incontinence issues and wears depends. I’m finding that he’s wearing a depends for way longer than its useful life. Which is contributing to the smell problem. One day the thing exploded on the kitchen floor, he ignored it and told my wife the dog must’ve gotten into something.  He has no restraint when he gets into an eating frenzy after a few days of severe depression without eating much of anything.  The other day he drank a gallon of orange juice that was for everyone. He will regularly eat any treats, ice cream or popsicles that are left in the freezer that are intended for the children. He’s welcome to everything, but I’d prefer he didn’t eat everything before anyone else has had a chance. What’s frustrating is that these are clearly for the children as they tend to me things like “Frozen II popsicles”. Clearly not meant for a man in his 70s. Again, he’s welcome to everything and in the early days of him moving in he would replenish what he took if he took more than his fair share. He’s also developed a Pavlovian response to 4pm, which is typically our dinner time for the kids. He will hermit away all day in his room, but as soon as it’s 4pm I’ve caught him sitting at the dinner table with an empty plate and fork waiting to be served dinner. I don’t want to confront him  about these things because I don’t want him to feel ostracized. But at the same time all of this adds up and we end up not inviting him to things because he’s become a bit of a liability when in public. Also, because he smells so bad I don’t want to be around him in public as it is incredibly embarrassing. My wife had to drive him 2 hours home after being on vacation for one day because he couldn’t handle it. Again we feel bad because we want him to feel a part of the family but all these things make it almost impossible. 

TLDR: I have no idea how to summarize. Clinically depressed FIL, eats all the food, smells really bad, otherwise of sound mind and physically capable. Embarrassing to be around. We want to include him in on family things but he’s too much of a liability (fall risk, soils himself). Btw the fall risk stuff is connected to the diabetes with the food frenzies and self imposed starvation, not necessarily bc he’s old. We’ve considered that he  also has beginnings of dementia but it’s impossible to separate the symptoms from everything else."

">All the significant others of someone who's depression, how do you deal with being with someone like that? 

Its incredibly difficult, but therapy, self-care, and open communication helps. Also knowing that he is putting in the effort to improve himself through medication and therapy himself makes all the difference. If he wasn't making an active effort to treat his illness, I would be gone - much like if someone were to just let an open wound fester. 

>Why do you even do it, what makes it worth it, 

Because I love him and want to see him get better.  The good days where his true self is in control, and the depression isn't, makes it worth it. Granted, the depression is always there in the shadows waiting for its chance to ruin those good days (and it frequently does), but when its kept at bay things are great. On the days its not so great, or outright terrible.. lots of crying in my car and self medicating at home (lol). 

>does it ever get tiring? 

Abso-fucking-lutely. The weed and therapy helps me stay sane when the depression makes him outright delusional and hate-filled.  He also recognizes his terrible behavior and owns up to it, which makes all the difference as well. It doesn't excuse the actions when the depression is in control, but at least it gives us a starting point to move from to address the underlying issues. 

>Did you ever know that he/she was like that before committing to the relationship?

I knew he had mood issues, but the severe clinical depression diagnoses wasn't made until after we married. To be honest, I probably would not have committed knowing this is what my life would become, but I am now here for him in sickness or in health - that's what our vows mean.  I just hope that some day he can find the correct medication mix to suppress the beast and bring back the man I fell in love with and married."

In my case, they don’t. Poked holes through who I thought I was. I became an alcoholic, never ever was abusive. But she “did what was best for her” while people whispered their perspectives of me, even said things that I knew she’d not come up with herself. Became poly, told me shit to make sure I wouldn’t pursue. I finally flipped after being told “ alright then get angry” afterwards, she cried calling my old roommate because I told her how she’s so reliant on her mom but acts like she’s done everything for herself. I hate feeling bitter but all I see is this super popular girl living the life of her dreams with these people and I’m dealing with a DUI and using this as motivation to be my best self. Brain chemicals still not working well. I used to be a different person, then depression slowly killed me and liquor multiplied it. If you’re depressed and have a weak self projection, you won’t be worth keeping around to another person. They simply wont remember the good being worth it. That’s what I’ve learned. I hope this is an exception and not the rule. I see in comments some have different realities and that makes me happy.

Not answering your question but I was happily married for many years before my now ex convinced me to leave everything and move to his home country. I really struggled when we arrived and went into a deep depression. I was so shocked at how unsupportive he was after so many truly happy years together and specifically after I had made such a significant sacrifice for him. I really believed that he would be there for me when I needed him. So, I also wonder about this question. I grew up with a lot of severe depression in my family and know very well what it’s like and how difficult it is to be on the other side of it. I guess some people are just not capable of sticking things out through the tough times. I don’t think even he knew that he wasn’t that person before all of this.

"I think the sad thing about depression is that usually people don’t have a lot of control over it, but it’s the thing they wish they could change most about themselves. And you can work on getting better by going to therapy, taking meds, etc but chances are it’s still going to be something you deal with regularly and takes time to overcome. 

I think the worst thing is feeling like you are too much for people or that because you have this mental illness that you don’t have much control over, therefore you deserve to struggle through it alone. I just think people aren’t meant to have to go through life alone, even when life is hard. I would never leave my friends just because they were struggling with their mental health, so why would I want my partner to have to go through it alone? 

I guess it depends on if they’re still capable of being a present and loving partner, but a lot of people with depression are still capable of being loving friends and loving partners. My boyfriend is also my best friend and more than anything I just want him to feel like he has someone on his side even when he isn’t feeling fully himself. I don’t love him any less for what he can’t control. Both of us have gone through really hard emotional times over the course of our relationship but we’ve still managed to remain loving and committed to each other through that. He is one of the things that really helps me feel like life is worth living when I’m going through a couple really depressed months.

"I was really depressed with a former partner. I think it rubbed off on me. It can be very hard, especially if they don't want to seek help. But there were good things about the experience and I learned a lot about relationships, my own depression and just handling my feelings (although I'm a work in progress, with therapy).

She was suicidal at times (cut herself periodically, abused pills, didnt eat), experienced neglect & sexual abuse as a child, incredibly codependent, and not very social. I come from a collectivist family dynamic (I took care of my grandmother for years, relatives assumed I'd keep that role until she eventually passed). So my family culture influenced how I conducted myself. I wanted to nurture.

With all that said, she was very open about everything. Her thoughts, her past experiences, her moods. Was it scary at times? Initially yes, but i learned to admire her forthcoming-ness. Id never met someone so honest about who they were and what they felt. And it allowed me to feel like i could be open with my own feelings. So there was a sense of not fearing judgement and learning patience and communicating sensitive things to each other. Rather than being passive aggressive with others before.

There were problems beyond both of our depression. Different priorities, different interests and hobbies and goals in life. My advice to anyone that is dating someone with severe depression is to try to be as patient as you can.

"I learned about bipolar disorder while falling in love with my now wife.  One of the hardest parts of it was getting her to realize that even with the depression (more frequent than manic part because of the meds she was on) she was intelligent, funny, introverted like me and comlimented my interests and filled in my weaknesses.  We were a good match, she just didn't see it as worthy of my interest and was afraid I would leave at the first rough spot.   Family history and genetics dealt her a rough deck and she was and is working her hardest to deal with it.  8 years of therapy, radical medical changes, a few scary manic phases and she finally realizes I wasn't going anywhere and effectively proposed to me after saying ""not yet"" multiple times.

To this day we joke about getting the better, worse, richer, poorer, sickness, and health out of the way before saying I do.

A depressed person is not in a good position to judge their own lovability or value to others. I saw the person inside, and found she could deal with my issues as well.  We make each other stronger, and I need to remind her from time to time that she is ""good enough"" (her words) to me.

It’s absolutely imperative that you take care of yourself and you should not feel bad about that. He would not want you to feel bad about it.

Yes definitely sounds like you guys just weren’t a good fit. I’m really sorry you are dealing with the alcoholism. That’s super rough. I truly hope that you get it under control. I know it’s not fun. My partner eventually died from alcohol related diseases. His death was awful. I certainly understand the self-medicating, but please try to practice harm reduction where you can. If somebody actually loves you they aren’t going to do so many of the things that you’ve described. Based on some of the language you have used, I am assuming you are probably under 30 years old. At any rate, please don’t give up on finding a partner that can support you if that’s what you want. I am at the point where I have had the love of my life, it was beautiful, and I have no desire or intention to find another. My only intention is to form strictly organic platonic friendships. And that is rare. I don’t seek them out but if they happen, that’s beautiful.	ImHidingtheRealMe	reply	na	na	na	0.004912094678729773	strong	strong	no	na	depression

Oh I’m so sorry l. I feel like she’d probably have a different perspective than “you dragged her down.” I could be wrong but doubt it. Ime It’s just more complex than that. Especially with kids in the picture. And I am not suggesting that kids + depressed parent= inherent bad situation, but they’re an added factor. I hope you’re able to be friends? In my experience friendship was the foundation of the relationship and the sicker we got the more important it was for us to rely on that friendship. His illnesses (mental and physical) eventually required openness to let each other be alone when necessary. I also have what I’d classify as some life threatening physical health problems in addition to my mental health stuff. I actually got sick before him. Totally different illnesses, both related to mental health interestingly. Our bodies take a big toll (remembers trauma) and shit gets real when brushes with death happen. So again it was understanding that we both needed extra space to just be sometimes. The relationship I guess didn’t look like everyone’s ideal but was 100% still worth it. Things I’m sure would’ve been different if we had children. It’s not that I think the relationship would dissolve. I think we’d have made the best decision for the kids and gone from there. I guess if I had one main point it’d be that solid friendship is very important because romance fluctuates and with depression certainly gets put on the back burner at times. And that’s ok.

Yeah, that shouldn’t be the dynamic.He should use his therapist and find other means of support. I would also recommend that anyone in a relationship with someone probably utilize therapy as well. It’s fucking hard. My partner really never did what you describe though. We talked about stuff but definitely not like a therapist and client. He didn’t strictly rely on me for support.

I was absolutely agreeing with what that person was saying. Basically saying “this.” I have now edited it because I see that it’s bothering people. Would you mind explaining to me why this is rubbing people the wrong way? Is it that you don’t know my tone? Hearing a depressed person say that (after so many others doubting we’re able to love them), it was a breath of fresh air. I was very glad to see it.

The stats you state don’t support your conclusions that most people with mental health issues end up divorcing or that a couple staying together is a rare case under the same circumstances. Consider that at least 1 in 3 experience a mental health issue at some point during their lives, hence the chance both partners have shared experience is relatively high, and therefore they might be willing to support each other. Consider also that most couples don’t marry, hence can’t divorce citing illness of their partner. Finally consider that many people lie on surveys and even divorce papers or, if not outright lie, they simplify complex truths. Data in this area sucks because we all suck at understanding human behaviour and our true motivations. So give the “majority” of your fellow humans a break.

Thank you for talking about the statistics. Normally, I don’t so much notice the stigma of depression. This is one area in which I do. Family members will tell you to find somebody else.

"Let's unpack this a little at a time.   

The start of your post says that you do not wish to go on a family trip.    From the context of your post, it sounds like you are at least eighteen years old.   Why can you not politely decline the family trip?   

Second, it sounds like your Dad is pretty toxic.   I don't know if it is possible, but as long as you stay around someone who is going to be like that, you are probably going to feel like that.   

Do you have the ability to change your environment?   Move in with a friend or family who cares about your mental health or get a job and a place of your own?

It sounds like you're being bullied in your own home.

I would suggest these changes might give you a feeling of being in control of your life.   If you can't even choose not to go on a vacation, then it doesn't sound like you have much control."	throwawayAITA39393	reply	na	na	na	0.9994611144065857	no	no	no	na	depression

I feel paralyzed to do anything at all besides the most drastic things. I can’t talk to my family about how I’m feeling. My dad is trying to get me to talk to him and saying her cares about me and wants to help while also saying awful things. I don’t know what to do but I know it’s all my fault. The only plan I’ve been able to come up with is to wait until everyone goes to sleep tonight and then hurt myself and get taken to a hospital.

"I have reasons that make me feel like kms, but then there's reasons that make me not kms. No matter how few the reasons are for continuing, they're far more worth living.

And, I almost did it in the past (kms) but was stopped at the right moment. Since that moment, things have changed, I made a lot of things right. The things I lost back then, I lost em forever, but better things replaced them.

Had I not been stopped, I would have never realized that, I had a chance, there was a way, there was hope. I also realised that, kms wouldn't have put a stop to the suffering. It may set me free, but my burdens and the burden of my deed would be transferred to someone else. And this burden stays forever. I realised this when I was saved and reunited with my family. When I watched their faces for the first time then, I realized the amount of pain and suffering I was about to cause them. It's been 5 years, and I still have that guilt, and that's one of the reasons, I will never kms.

"Ngl life sucks hard - everyone suffers even if they were born on easy mode as the 1%. We all feel pain, stress, loss of loved ones, and will even die one day one or way another regardless of how much some of us wish not to. But let’s put it into perspective how we got here..

BILLIONS of things before us have died for us to get here. There were wars, disasters, and miracles that led up to the creation of your DNA. Some of those lives didn’t even have a choice to move on. We exist because of all the accumulation of those energy transfer and cascading effects…and yet you want the conclusion to your existence be over a matter of just giving up: that’s the biggest waste of energy if I ever heard one.

How can you let all of that energy go to waste. Think of the potential! One day your lineage may be the very key to solving a real problem we don’t know how to solve yet: YOU DON’T KNOW UNTIL YOU TRY. You have genetic potential: don’t let it go to waste.

Nothing is forever and neither is your current state, things always change, sometimes for the better sometimes for the worse, but they do absolutely change.

You cant predict the change, just know it'll come, something unexpected will take your life to a new and great direction.

And one day when youre in a great period of your life, when youre happy, something unexpected will happen again, this time bad, and will take you back to a low place.

HOWEVER, one day when a difficult change of things takes place, you'll have a revelation WITHIN YOURSELF.
You will at last understand that you only have two options, either going back to that depressive state, wishing you were dead, or proactively do something about yourself and your life, make the next change a choice and not just chance.

I am in a low point rn but unlike past low points I in no way feel like id rather give up on life and die, I see the hope I see the next change for the better and I trust myself to make it happen.
This is all a realisation you get within yourself one day.
You can handle it, you can deal with it, fix it, and it will happen to you.
Just bite the bullet in the meantime and keep on fighting.

"So I have had anxiety since I was 5. I am now 37. I didn’t know my feelings were anxiety because I always processed it as fear. Anxiety is essentially fear and worry. I met a guy on here that ghosted me haha 😂 but he told me once that a lot of our fears we have already lived out in our heads. We are more prepared in a way because people with anxiety have prepped for worst case scenarios in our minds. We just can’t except that we are ready. But we are. If that makes sense.

For me, I take Wellbutrin and trazadone for depression, buspar for anxiety with some occasional xanex on the rough days.

What I can say is medication helps but I’ve yet to meet a person who is completely freed from it on meds. Well maybe the guy I mentioned above. What worked for me, was pep talks. To myself. Out loud. “You got this girl. Everything is going to be ok. If (a) happens I’ll do this and if (b) scenario happens I’ll do that.” In essence being my own sounding board. It helps me.

"Disclosure: I am not a therapist or physician and can only speak to my experiences. It’s really normal to have a depression trigger and it to cause small spirals into dark places. Then you feel like people around you hate you for it. But because you can’t control it, you hate yourself for it.

Not sure your age. However, it doesn’t hurt to be seen for a work up and explain your symptoms. You may have something going on. I have a heart condition and that can trigger anxiety too.

ALSO!! Make sure you eat enough. Our bodies need fuel in order for our brains to function. If you aren’t getting enough calories, your body can go into a state of distress and it cause anxiety on purpose. Trying to tell you “danger Will Robinson! We don’t have enough fuel.” This will happen BTW regardless of your weight. ALSO, water. Drink plenty of water. Even flavored water. But WATER. 

Caffeine should probably be limited with the panic attacks. But a little could help pep you up only on depression days. If it’s anxiety AVOID AVOID AVOID. The biggest thing is to find a way to cope if you have trigger before it spirals. If you can start recognizing them, you might be able to start helping yourself a little better."

So if you do the research, you’ll could potentially cut some of the time to diagnosis.

"To answer your question: Yes, depression can hit you at your age.   The fact that you are learning about it and trying to educate yourself about it, is a good thing.    

You mentioned that you have attempted to talk to your mother about it and that she wasn't open to discussing your concerns.    

I would suggest attempting to talk to other adults who care about you as well.   School counselors or teachers are usually a resource that you might be another place to reach out.   

Reaching out here and online might allow you to talk and vent, but sometimes the advice is less than professional so I would suggest talking to other people who might help in your life as well."		reply	na	na	na	0.9988071918487549	weak	no	no	na	depression
My psychiatrist insists that I have to treat my depression first even though I told him that I am depressed because of my ADHD. I am diagnosed with MDD, GAD with possible cooccurring ADHD. He put me on bupropion which pretty much cured my depression and a lot of my anxiety reduced. It has not done much for my ADHD symptoms. I need to get these under control before my next semester, I am worried that he will not understand. He said insurance requires that he treats depression and anxiety first. Is it standard practice to treat depression and anxiety before ADHD or is it usually a combined effort to treat everything?

"I think it is standard practice for anxiety to get it under control. This is because many ADHD meds contain stimulants that can worsen anxiety. This can actually carry over and worsen depression. So that’s WHY they do that.

You’re doing an excellent job of recognizing your mental health and getting it treated!! Also being your own advocate is a highly cherished skill set. So BRAVO 👏🏻

My girlfriend left me recently with little to know explanation, I've lost about 5 or 6 friends and they've been blaming me for everything. I have no support circle aside from a few close friends. I am getting older, my confidence has been stolen and I don't feel worth appreciating. My parents are always fighting, I dont have a family. I am unlovable and will be stuck by myself. I hate everything I am and resent all of my flaws even if they're things I can't control. Everything feels bleak and hopeless and the multiple therapists I have tried to contact have all ignored me. I want to give up really badly. I don't think I can be saved this time.	stillmovingincircles	post	12.113569786354754	female	White	0.9990357160568237	na	na	na	0	depression
"College student here!

I hurt someone very close to me, my only real friend, and now they aren’t talking to me anymore. I made a huge mistake, I held myself accountable, but I don’t know how to deal with this horrible feeling. 

I’ve joined communities on Twitter to talk with people about my interests with. But, even there it’s hard to make friends and I feel so alone and anxious. Why is it so hard to make friends without feeling like everyone hates me?

Everyday, it feels like the same day is repeating. I finally got a new job and I’m starting orientation tomorrow but I’m so scared and my fear is it will end up as bad as my first job and make me feel even worse. 

My mindset right now is that at least I’ll be moving and active but I don’t know. This doesn’t erase the constant loneliness I feel everyday."	weus_0830	post	2.0770563158110065	male	White	0.9986900687217712	na	na	na	1	depression
"Loneliness is awful. I understand. Especially being in college. When you really need to have people lifting you up. It’s hard to make friends online because people can block you or in general don’t really actually give two shits. The real friend you had, maybe not all hope it lost. Give it some time and don’t be pushy. They make come back around. 

New job!! That’s excellent! What a great way to meet new people! Make new friends! I bet it’s going to be great! And those feelings of everybody hating you? That’s your demons talking. I think everybody I talk to hates me lol you’re just a person who needs lots of reassurance. That’s ok! There are lots of us out there. Eventually you’ll be at a place where it won’t bother you as much. But if you need that reassurance, it’s ok to check in with people that you’re ok.

My dad has always pressured me in school, last year (8th grade) it got to a point where I was under too much pressure and I wanted to find something that could calm me down and allow me to enjoy life. I converted some CBD to THC and instantly loved how I felt while under the influence. I started to do it daily along with a sleeping med called brotizolam that I found in my grandparents house. Overtime my grades got really bad but I didnt have much motivation to complete any work. Later in may of 8th grade I told my dad about my anxiety issues so I got prescribed 10mg prozac. I went on prozac for about a month during the summer and it felt as if the prozac made my anxiety and depression worse. Because it was the summer and I had gone on vacation I didnt have much access to substances and I began to go through stages of suicidal ideations and depression. I opened up to my dad about the marijuna issues I had in 8th grade and he was supportive of it in that moment trying to help me. Later this summer I was caught by my mom taking xanax which I had taken from my grandparents. After my dad heard about it he tells me he cant trust me anymore and hes disappointed. Hes not letting me hangout with friends or do what I enjoy for the next year or until I gain his trust back. I know what I did was wrong but since then Ive been having issues with alcohol. I feel like the thought of not being able to hangout with friends when I get back from vacation and not being able to do what I enjoy has made my anxiety and depression worse. I used to always go to my dad if I needed someone to talk to but now he leaves me on read and replies with paragraphs on what the boundaries will be when I get back. Is my relationship with my dad ruined? And how can I gain his trust back?	Redditalt123478	post	28.332435875885942	female	White	0.9948189854621887	na	na	na	2	depression
"Hi

Sorry your going through such a difficult time.

Your relationship with your dad can be saved and you can gain his trust back.

It sounds like you have serious issues with substance abuse and until your willing to get the help you need with your drug use, drinking alcohol and stealing your relationship with your dad is going to be strained.

The good thing is if your willing to stop these behaviors and prove to your dad and all of your family your going to work hard to stop the drinking, the drug use and the stealing they will want to do all they can to help you.

Ask for help with your mental health and also let them know that you want to make the changes so they can trust you and eventually become proud of you.

It's won't be easy and it's not just saying your going to change you need to do it and stick with it.

These changes will be difficult but if your willing to do them and stick with it they will see how hard your trying and they will be proud of you and when you prove to them that you can be trusted and your not drinking and doing drugs things will improve with your dad and the rest of your family.

Start with getting help for your mental health problems and your substance abuse the stealing will hopefully stop as well.

When your doing better and not drinking or doing drugs your school work should also start to improve.

Your wanting to restore your relationship with your dad will be really good motivation for you and you can gain his trust back if your willing to get the help you need and make the changes that will make them proud of you.

Hope things work out for you and you ask for the help you need to deal with the things you have been struggling with.

Start with a proper mental health assessment, therapy and support for addiction and substance abuse."	Redditalt123478	reply	na	na	na	0.9948189854621887	strong	no	no	na	depression

so basically, ive recently lost interest in some of my hobbies, been spending most of my time bored and alone. i worry about being a loner and not achieving success for the rest of my life. a lot of negative thoughts come to my mind at night. also my sleep schedule is totally fucked because of all the tiktok scrolling, although i am trying my best to fix it. is this a normal thing for teenagers or do i have depression? if i do, do i have any hope to recover from this?	televisionbike	post	23.634763933	male	White	0.9990870952606201	na	na	na	3	depression

"I have long considered reaching out for help from others but I finally decided to do it now.

For context, I have been married to my wife for 3 of the 5 wonderful years we've known each other and are both in our late 20s. I would say we are both happily married to each other and I think we have a healthy relationship. We don't fight (argue sometimes but never raising our voices or getting nasty/petty). We have a comfortable life with a house we own, no debt other than a reasonable mortgage and car payment. I'm in the military and make enough money that she doesn't need to work unless she wants to or we want to be more aggressive in saving and paying off stuff. We both have friends and we hang out with each others friends once or twice a month. All in all I'd say we live a good and comfortable life.

I'm reaching out for help because my wife has struggled with depression for a long time. Since before I met her 5 years ago. The year before we met and the first year we were friends she was in a very dark spot. Self harm, seriously contemplating suicide, and even going so far as to stop just short of actually doing it twice. She says that I helped her a lot back in those days and we started dating and then got married after 6 months of being close friends and a year and a half of dating. Since those days I'd say that she has plenty of times where she gets melancholic (I do too though not as frequently). However it seems like once or twice a year the depression gets bad for a month or so. Other than when we first met, the worst I've seen it is when she got a new job and her boss was incredibly toxic and emotionally abusive. This really did a number on her and her coworkers and she was contemplating suicide and she told me about it. I don't think that was the actual main reason but it was a lot for her and it took her several months of not working just to recover to her normal self.

I've noticed that because of her bouts with depression, her mental resiliency is one of her weaker suits. She'll let seemingly small things, things most would easily shrug off, get her down for the rest of the day or longer. Things as simple as me planning on being home at a certain time and showing up an hour later because of military obligations coming up, even though it has no effect on the rest of the day or her plans. 

I was deployed for 6 months last year and she said that it was understandably pretty tough for her. She said it was rough during it but she seemed to be well after I got home and since then.

A few weeks ago we had someone attempt to steal our car and it's been in the shop since. She said she's been feeling ""trapped"" at home since we now only have one car. A feeling that doesn't really make sense to me since she works the night shift and sleeps during the day while I'm at work, which means she usually might only be awake for maybe an hour or two at the house without a car. We want to trade the car at the shop for a new car when it gets fixed. A newer used car that she wants and will drive but several options have come and gone since it's taking so long to get fixed. This is really getting to her and now she said she just gives up. 

I knew that she hasn't been in the greatest mental state for the last 2 months, but all of this is pushing her over the edge. She told me the other day that she's been thinking about ending it all. I turned on my supportive husband/friend role up to the max, but this time feels different. Since getting married the only other time she's talked about suicide was with her old job 2 years back that I mentioned. Unlike back then though, this time she's talking about making plans. How she is going to wait until I get my next Qual at the end of next month (something that will take up almost all of my free time studying for... along the lines of 3-5 hours of studying at home a day on top of the normal work hours). She said she's making plans about picking up more shifts to leave me with less debt after she's gone. How I will easily find another person and live a happy life because I'm a good guy. Plans for the dogs and house and not getting a new car so I wouldn't have to worry about that. She also told me that she wrote letters to all the people she cares about that are saved away for when it happens. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. This woman means the world to me. I try to be as supportive as I can, and I'd consider myself to be a very empathetic person. I get her to laugh, buy her food she loves, do some extra chores aroudn the house.  I encourage her to work out (she said it used to help her a lot before we met), go on walks together or alone, go to the beach, talk to friends, etc. Her mom is callous so that isn't an option since she told her to just ""go ahead and do it"" when she told her she was suicidal during college. Her dad is a kind soul but he isn't the best when it comes to talking about emotions, but I still encourage her to talk to him. She has someone like a second father to her who is a pastor and has helped her through rough times in the past. I think he would be the best option for people she knows, but she's never told him about being suicidal and is afraid of his opinion of her if she told him. 

I have encouraged her now and for years to talk to a therapist, but she is adamantly against that. She has said everything from ""I don't need one"", ""I don't trust them"", ""it would somehow make its way back to you and effect you in the military"", etc. I told her there are free therapists in the military you can talk to in person or over the phone and I'd be more than happy to pay for her to go see one out in town that has no affiliation with the military. All to no avail.

I just don't know what to do anymore other than just continuing to be supportive and encourage her to talk to others and do things that will help her. My greatest fear in life is losing her to depression."	SteakAdorable8060	post	28.68667069092473	male	White	0.002113538095727563	na	na	na	2	depression
"Friend, I am sorry your wife is experiencing that severe of depression. I cannot possibly know what you are going through, considering my wife has not shared the same experience. I have not experienced depression to the extent you described either, but I have felt suicidal. As for sharing that experience, this subreddit is not the place for that. This subreddit would block me because it involves matters of faith. If you happen to post a different phrasing of your post in the Christian subreddit, many people will respond accordingly.   
This subreddit provides links to talk with someone, hopefully, a licensed counselor, to go about the best way to help your wife. Again, if I were to share according to a faith perspective, this subreddit would block my response.   
As for what you suggest in your post concerning the different methods of help for your wife, I would pursue those on your own first to get information on what you can begin to do. I wouldn’t wait any longer, either. Your situation with your wife appears to be near crisis and demands immediate attention. Please seek the sources you cited immediately.

Im a 24 year old woman with two beautiful children and Im just embarrassed to be alive. The thought of enduring this pain and shame and that deep, gnawing ache in my chest for the rest of my life makes me feel so hopeless. 

I feel immense guilt for bringing two people into this world who will most likely struggle with the same issues I do. I’ll be forced to watch them grow up and become acquainted with this terrible illness and I won’t be able to save them from it.

"Your post hit me. As a father of 2 myself, I have felt what you do. 

They are your reason to keep going. They need you. Desperately. And that is the main reason why your existence is not embarrassing, but rather purposeful and prideful. 

It can get better. 

I am testimony to that. 

I lived for years with anxiety and depression. 21 years. For the first time in my life, they are gone now. 

For me, the best advice I can give is to start your journey in earnest. 

Self reflect. Write it down in pen. 

All your pain, all your regret and all your shame. 

Now the hard part. 

Let it all go. 

It’s written down. Can’t change it. Don’t get white out lol. 

Past is gone. Can’t change it. But you have the rest of the piece of paper left to right down new thoughts, new emotions, new feelings. 

Go slowly. With kindness and empathy to yourself. Treat yourself like you would someone else. Positive self talk is important. Go somewhere private and speak out loud to yourself. 

Speak to a therapist, meds if needed for short term. They can help. 

Get some light exercise. Go for a walk, 20 minutes around your neighbourhood. Put some happy or uplifting music on. 

Remember, small steps. Keep going. 1 foot at a time. 

This too shall pass.

Not sure what I want from this post. Maybe just want to vent. I’ve been fighting depression most of my life. Sometimes it’s ok, sometimes it’s bad but it’s always there. I just turned 41, I have a beautiful wife and 2 amazing toddlers. I have so much love for my family, but right now I want to disappear. I just want to die and not feel any pain anymore. I’m sick of being sad. I hate that I can’t just be normal and love life like my family does. I haven’t been able to leave the house in days and I keep coming up with excuses to not go to work. I can’t find joy in anything that used to make me happy and feel so much guilt over that. I feel so much guilt that I would destroy my little family by not existing anymore. I would hate for my wife to think she wasn’t enough to keep me alive. She is amazing. But I’m the problem. The fight between staying around for my family or selfishly ending my life is getting harder. I don’t deserve them. I don’t deserve this life. They don’t deserve me ruining theirs. I want everything to be black, and I want to finally rest. I want nobody to care. I want to be guilt free. I just need to disappear.

"Edit title: quit therapy *and* antidepressants 

summary:
- 2 years ago was diagnosed with major depressive disorder 
- started both therapy and antidepressants (SSRI)
- experienced a very positive change during the first few months 
- reached a plateau 
- started feeling depressive again, but this time with no anxiety or sadness. Just emotional numbness, withdrawal, major inactivity.
- this period went on for more than a year.
- until 3 months ago, when I unilaterally decided to quit both therapy and SSRI (irresponsible, I know).

Result: I have experienced absolutely no difference at all. I feel exactly the same, which is not very good to be honest. But I’m very stable, as I already was.

"

I really do have to make a change because I can’t keep living like this and feeling like this, I hate myself so much. The next couple months I really have to dedicate my time to getting healthy again physically and mentally. I want to become the man I want to be and stop having moments of weakness. I don’t know if that means cutting everybody off and focusing on myself or what I have no clue, but I honestly don’t know how I’ve gone this long feeling like this. It’s so hard to wake up every day and hate yourself, be embarrassed of who you are and feel like a failure. I think I drink to mute those thoughts sometimes and I don’t know when to stop. I’ve done so much shit I’ve regretted and it’s all been done while I was drinking. I don’t know when I became so fucked up in my head but I can’t do it anymore. It’s hard to talk to anyone, everyone always tells me I’m living the dream or doing good for my age but I fucking hate myself. I feel like a loser from the time I open my eyes to the time I close them. I have no self esteem, no confidence, I have to rely on people to like me to make me feel better about myself. I know I’m too hard on myself but I can’t stop it. I want to cry 24/7, I’m so ashamed of who I am. I hate myself so much, the shit I say to myself is insane, I’ve never admitted to anyone or said it out loud before but I think about dying all the time. Constantly, how much easier everything would be. I’m already on medicine, all I do is work and sleep. The only relief I feel is sleep. I’m afraid to tell anyone how I really feel because I don’t know what the consequences are, I don’t want to lose my job, lose my girlfriend or have my family think I’m crazy or they made me this way.

I don't want to kill myself; I just want to stop feeling like this. I have family and friends whom I see a lot and enjoy spending time with, but I still just feel so empty and alone. I'm constantly trying to distract myself, but it's getting harder and harder to not feel like this all the time. Everyone says it will get better or to just keep moving forward, but I've been doing that for the past 20 years. When does it get better? I'm sorry, I just needed to vent somewhere. I'm just so tired. I wish I could just stop existing.	Practical-Number171	post	24.51557558270827	male	White	0.9992163181304932	na	na	na	1	depression
Very relatable. Theres just constant dread of having to wake up and exist. And the thought that we are expected to conform to the cookie cutter idea of what happiness looks like. Get a job, get a relationship, go out with friends, have a set of hobbies and interests. Do those things really equate to happiness or am i just told that it does.

i dont know what im doing. why am i doing this. i dont leave the house except for 1 appointment every week. been like this 4 years. im sick of staring at a screen hoping it will just stop. im tired of sitting in this chair. quite literally the only things i do is play games when i get motivation to mindlessly play something and watch dumb videos. and smoke. im just rotting my brain on purpose so i dont have to deal with it. my memory went out the window 2 yrs ago. i cant talk to people. i cant look them in the eye. all i feel is disconnection. ive always been a loner but it feels different now. i want to avoid people at all costs yet last time i used a weighted blanket i cried cuz it felt like a hug. not even a hug but it felt like something. somehow my body is falling apart. im 22 yet i have constant pain in my knees shoulders back feet hands and teeth. just a little addition on top. its weird how pain can variate. one day it barely hurts. next day it feels like im chewing on an open nerve in my mouth. plus the insanity driven shit show that happened a few years ago caused the dentist to schedule appointments a YEAR away. im still nowhere near a dentist appointment. by the time i get there ill need new xrays for the abscesses in my mouth. already had one they pulled and when they did a hole from my sinus into my mouth was opened. the anxiety is killing me. i feel like i can barely breath half the time. all of this not to mention im an utterly useless jobless pathetic virgin piece of shit. i so genuinely despise myself. i just wish i wasnt so scared to do it. i tried before but i messed it up i was fucking ready but it didnt work. now im even more of a bitch. terrified. of myself. i pray if god is real he take me tonight. im just at a loss. i can not do this. this is not for me. 	garbageperso	post	16.383699294940214	female	White	0.999424934387207	na	na	na	1	depression
"alright stop stop stop - back the fuck up

1) stop smoking. first milestone.
there are so many problems with what you have listed but you gotta take it in small steps. The biggest thing you can do right now is stop smoking. It’s killing your body, brain, and energy level.

2) start walking everyday. put on sunscreen and go outside. You need the sun. It doesn’t have to be for an hour. Just walk 5 minutes around the block. You mention body pain - so just take it easy: if you need more than 5 minutes that perfectly fine. It’s probably best to do this when you wake up so you get it out of the way. Don’t do it after you get comfortable sitting in front of your computer: because you’re not going to. Wake up, take a small walk, and enjoy the rest of your day. It’s a small accomplishment but it’s still an accomplishment. Trust me the sun helps a lot.

3) Stop focusing on the negatives. I guess that’s hard to do when you’re not doing anything except focusing on the negatives. See how that works? It’s a vicious cycle. When you’ve stopped smoking for a month focus on how far you’ve come. That’s a positive. It’s going to be tough(I’ve seen how moody people can get when they stop smoking) but that’s what makes the wins so much more satisfying than the losses.

If you fail this month to stop - that’s okay. Start again, and see if you can stop the next month. There are 12 months for you to try - you just need one full month clean - you got this 👍. and no - don’t substitute smoking with vaping - that’s just cheating. the goal is to stop putting junk in your body. anyone will feel like shit if they are constantly putting shit into their tank."	garbageperso	reply	na	na	na	0.999424934387207	weak	no	no	na	depression
It's been a year to the day. Last year, I tried to kill myself because I'm so lonely. I didn't have a single friend I could talk to freely. Since then, I've tried making friends, but that didn't work. They don't stick. I've even lost my girlfriend of 5 years. I'm so lonely. I fucking hate it here.

"I'm tired, but I won't go to sleep. I feel lazy, but I won't go to the gym. I am about to go back to college after a hiatus for mental health and I don't think I'm ready. Last year, my dad insisted I take a gap year. I didn't listen so now I'm out a semester's worth of tuition for nothing. He asked if I was sure I'm ready now, and I said yes, but I'm honestly not so sure. I had a ""full time"" job this past year. But I say that in quotations because I couldn't work half the time. Not enough spoons or whatever. I need to study materials bc it's been a year, but I'm just not. Instead I'm just being my usual waste-of-oxygen self. I know that my worth is not tied to how much I work, but I can't even work to serve myself. I'm not currently suicidal, but I guarantee that's gonna change once there's the slightest bit of pressure. One day it's not just gonna be thoughts. I wish everyone would just forget/stop loving me so I could do it without guilt. I'm so goddamn privileged. From the outside looking in, I should be the happiest person ever. Yet I haven't been genuinely happy for like 2 years. Some days are good. Hell, some weeks are great. But for every one of those, there are 2 horrible ones. What's truly crazy is that I don't want to change. After all that one would think I would kill to be better. But I don't even want to be better. I don't want to change anything. I want to want to be better. Apathetic is a good word I guess. But that's life... And I don't like nor want it.

"That you are thinking about it you are ready or not is always a good thing and having doubts is totally normal. Also about the tuition, if you have enough for your day to day life money(tuition or whatnot) is just a number. 
And no you don’t need to study because it has been a year - some people work their whole life without a degree and others start a degree and never finish it. So don’t let the semester bother you too much and just take it one day at a time and see if it works out.
Also don’t let others dictate if you should be happy in your situation or not. Just because others might be happy in that situation doesn’t mean you have to be happy in this situation as everyone is different and wonderful in their own way. So don’t let others tell you to be happy - that’s for you and only you to decide."	rockieroad1999	reply	na	na	na	0.9993141889572144	weak	no	no	na	depression

"I have always struggled with bouts of depression. It seems that I get “a few months off” and then it comes back again. I have done so much inner work and worked so hard to make my environment better…I went to school, got a degree, got a job, got a promotion, got friends, I am learning to drive, I have been on 3 vacations this year and another one in a few weeks…

I used to be so sweet and friendly to everyone. I used to believe something better was round the corner. I used to have hope and faith that everything would fall into place somehow and that i’d never have to feel the blackness ever again. After a bad breakup a few months ago, I feel too bitter and empty to carry on the pretense. With this person I finally thought that I might just be ok, maybe I was normal after all. Maybe I really was good enough to be loveable. Then he decided I wasn’t for him, and it’s like my life is over just as it was starting to get good. The world has truly lost its glitter and magic. I used to be innocent and hopeful, now I am self conscious, shy, unable to connect with anyone, just want to be left alone but at the same time long for deep connection and human affection. I’m too broken and fragmented and distrusting and avoidant of people in general and I don’t know how to fit all the pieces of myself back together. I feel like i cannot pull myself out of the black hole for the hundredth time, i just have no capacity to do it again. I just want to wipe the slate clean and make myself whole again instead of tainted and negative. I just can’t imagine a world in which everything is ever going to be alright.

I as a male feel very similar. As much as I don’t want to be, I feel bitter for bring left at my worst. They go on to be happy with egotistical super socal types and I fall deeper into depression and collet a DUI. The alcohol as a coping mechanism was killing me. I lose hope and regain motivation multiple times throughout the day. I exercise and do a ton of cardio, but there still feels like I’m off, like I’ve always been. My ex said she recognized a deep sadness in me, one others could identify too. I told her about the trauma that had happened when I was young, that I held onto for years. She decided I wasn’t worth saying with and ran away at a music festival with some cheap guy who tries his hand at every woman. Guess that’s the confidence she wants in life. Meanwhile I actually have the form to be rightfully confident but depression has sapped my life. I feel like a 30 year old failure. Take the lesson that you thought you were “good enough” to be lovable, and try to understand that you are. Don’t lose all hope, it’s all we have sometimes. This you isn’t the permanent you.

"People don't get to choose who they give birth to or whom they are born to. Whether or not they ""deserve"" it, dying wouldn't change that, it'd just make them feel miserable, think they could have done more, and impact them for the rest of their lives. As some studies show:

> People bereaved by the sudden death of a friend or family member are 65% more likely to attempt suicide if the deceased died by suicide than if they died by natural causes.

Whatever issues you may have, the solution to them isn't death, but trying to change things and improve yourself, both personally and the way you think about things. And unlike in death, as long you're alive you can change things.

"I mention sexual assault in this post, so please don’t read it if that can trigger you. 

I’m 24 and my life has been complete shit. My childhood was hell and things haven’t gotten much better. I was sex trafficked for a decade until I was 14 by my parents. When my father left the trafficking stopped, but my mother continued to abuse me until I moved out at 19. I lived with my aunt for awhile and the only thing I managed to do was go back to school to get my high school diploma (my mom made me drop out when I was 15). I ended up in a residential treatment program for anorexia and was forced to move back in with my mom. 

Now I’m 24 and I still live with her. I don’t have any support or friends. My relationship with my family is terrible and my mom is still abusive. I want to move out, but I don’t have a license, a degree, or a job. I’m depressed, not in the sense that I feel suicidal, but more in the sense that I feel stuck. I want to leave this situation more than anything, but I’m isolated here with my mom and it’s frustrating. She won’t help me get my license and there’s no one who can teach me. We live in the country with no public transportation and I don’t know anyone other than my mom in this stupid city. 

I just want to be happy. I don’t want to live my life stuck in some stupid 9 to 5 job that makes me feel miserable. I’ve been miserable my whole life. But I don’t know anything about myself. I never had the opportunity to explore my passions as a kid and I still haven’t. I don’t know what I want to do with my life, hell I don’t even know what I enjoy doing in life. I honestly don’t enjoy a lot about life. I’m so fucking depressed, I just want to lay in bed all of the time. Everything feels pointless. My situation with my mom keeps escalating and I need to get out; but I don’t have money, a job, a car, or a place to go. I don’t have anyone who can help me, most people don’t even believe my mom is abusive because she’s so good at playing a fake persona. 

I don’t want to die, for the first time in my life I value myself and my life more than anything. But this loop I’ve been stuck in, it isn’t living. I’m miserable, I’m sad, I hate my body to the point I wish I could rip my skin off. Nobody believes me when I talk about my mom, my aunt called me a liar and forced me to move back in with her. She said she refused to play a part in ruining my mother and mines relationship. My family thinks I hate my mom and just want to ruin her life, they all blame me for my abuse. I was 4 the first time I was raped by my dad. I didn’t even have breast yet, but somehow I’m the one who influenced my father’s behavior. I’m just tired. Everyone tells me to grow up and get over the past, but how can I get over something that’s still apart of my life? I can’t get a job, thanks to my mom. Honestly? I don’t even know if I have the energy for one, most days I can’t even get out of bed. The mental health system where I live is fucked and the police have never been helpful, even when I was a kid. I feel abandoned, alone, and sad. I’m just tired. So fucking tired."	anonomoosee	post	17.495983290550605	female	White	0.9987175464630127	na	na	na	2	depression

"I have many days and moments where I feel like I can’t go on. The entire month of June was this way for me.

I don’t want to die either but there are times when I contemplate suicide. My kids are what I hold on to. I used to ask why god thought I’d make a good mother when so many other women are more qualified. I guess I have kids so I can remember what I’m fighting for. 

The thing is, you do have something to hold on to. That’s you! Are you perfect? Nope. Are you going to fuck up a lot and question your self worth? Absolutely. That’s what depression does to us. But are you worth holding on to? Even if only by yourself? YOU ARE!! You are one of a kind. 

Its so hard because when you’re depressed, every task feels like you’re walking through quicksand, in hurricane winds, with weights around your wrists and ankles. It feels impossible to even find the will to live at times.

But you are worth fighting for. You are worth holding on to. Sometimes I just wake up in the mornings, have my coffee in the closet so I can sit and cry. I allow myself to fall apart for 30 min. Then I get up and try to knock something off of my white board that is productive. I found that one productive thing, no matter how small makes a big difference in my mental health. Just one small task at a time.

Anyways, I just wanted to reach out and say that my lowest point in my life was in June. I still have multiple depression spirals a week but I came through it. The worst of it anyways.

"Depression is a terrible thing to live with. People have no idea how much strength is required just to keep trudging on. Sometimes when I feel like I can't anymore I just try to hang on. The depression will ease up, eventually. It always does although it never feels like it will. 

It's hard to get through the dark times. Everything has a negative filter over it. Even so called pleasurable activities are a chore. Sleep is a relief but then the anxiety kicks in making that escape impossible as well.

I get why people can't go on as well. I've lost people that way and I don't think I could do it. It leaves too much pain behind for others even if my depression tells me no one would notice.

"Same I’m living with the worst depression and adversity I have ever dealt with in my life. My life was amazing! I was traveling, exploring, working, doing what I wanted on my own time living life to the fullest until February of this year. The love of my life ended things with me two days after Valentine’s Day. Come to find out she met someone behind my back 3+ months prior getting to know him and never told him she was in a relationship. I decided to fly back to my home state while dealing with the on and off from the relationship from a distance because I was so still in love , the lies, the deceit. 

She ended it with me again sometime after I ended up severely injuring my back to the point where it affected some of my normal bodily functions; sexual dysfunction, genital numbness, bowel and bladder dysfunction. She told me she never stopped talking to him when she told me she did, that she loves him and that he’s perfect and they are the same people that they were meant to be together while I was at my lowest point in life. 

Had to end up moving out of my condo I was renting and into the house that I originally put my name on the lease to rent and paid for for my parents and sister to get out of my condo. I had to go there because I ended up needing to get spine surgery to get the compression off my sacral nerves and needed physical and mental support. 

My mental health was so shook I couldn’t even do daily tasks without asking someone to tell me to remind me to brush my teeth or tell me to go shower. Well let’s just say recovery should have been a walk in the park? It could have been, but my mental health by then had consumed me. I am in counseling which my health insurance does not cover and they wanted me to try medications which made me worse and manic.  I felt like a shadow of my former self, I was losing myself. It has severely impacted my recovery so far. 

I was catastrophizing everything. All my vacations and work plans canceled for the rest of the year. Savings from the past two years of hard work being vaporized while in recovery. My mental health and bad spine may affect me possibly returning to my career due to not recovering properly or just because the anatomy of my spine has been altered from surgery. On top of that I am still somewhat financially helping my family while I’m not working. 

Aside from that I also somehow exacerbated and acquired an injury to my neck that could have the possibility of needing surgery as well don’t know yet. My current physical therapy clinic isn’t as good as what I thought it was gonna be and it’s about $900/mo. Waiting for my surgeons office to get back to me about my imaging, but who knows when that will be because I still need imaging done on my previous surgery site. My body is going numb in places all over and becoming weaker. I’m now in pain and discomfort everyday. It’s to the point where my mental health and my body affect my sleep. It’s no longer comfortable. 

I now have to possibly look into applying for disability when I was someone recently making over 6 figures. I am racking up so much medical debt it’s insane in the span of only 2 and 1/2 months with my already established debt. I have never taken so many prescription medications in this short span of time in my life. 

My life has been flipped upside down just like that. My depression has progressed to the point where I think about death everyday. My mind is flooded constantly with memories of my previous life. I can no longer find joy in things that I used to like. I have forgotten what it was like to be happy when I was just happy back in April of this year. 

I am so traumatized I am becoming dissociative, despondent and depressed. I am typing this after staying up all night due to being scared of the results of my mri image from yesterday and fear of sleeping and injuring myself in my neck further as I try to do something as simple as sleep. 

I have a therapy appt in less than 3 hours. I most likely won’t make it as I will eventually just pass out from exhaustion. My life feels like it has been taken away from me. Who would want me like this? I look like a hobo. I used to be decently groomed. 6”5 195-200lbs now I look like a skeleton. Depression is such a soul crusher and life stealer."

"So nice of you to say those things, it brings tears to my eyes and I want to let it all out, I struggle badly with this. 

It's a horrible thing to feel useless and worthless and not worthy of accepting all the good things that I have been blessed with, and I am thankful for them. To me, it's physical pain. I carry it around. People don't know what to say and there are lots of very awkward silences. I wish I could somehow let people see how bad it is and maybe they'd rally or something. 

The sad thing is, for some of us here, that we aren't alone. It has robbed me of my personality or something, my ability to describe or be in touch with my emotions. 

I have a daughter, but like many dads in the UK, her mum decided that it's best for her that I am not in her life. She is 27 and I really do believe it IS better for her that am not in her life. I don't want to infect her with this curse.

I try to do this, but it's hard because people don't know what to say and it can be awkward, making me want to leave. There will be people who you like and who like you. Phone them, and go there if you can.

"My dad recently attempted suicide, and since then he has moved closer to me so I can help take care of him. I am there to talk with him and listen to him every day. I try to alleviate stressors for him as much as I can. For example, he has two dogs he recently tried to get rid of them because he felt they were too much, but I convinced him to keep them because I know he loves them deep down and feel he needs company and something to live for. So while they live with him I’ve taken over their care by walking them, feeding them, and handling vet care for them. 

I regularly invite him over to my house, which is a five minute walk away, but he consistently declines. I bring him my home cooked meals to try to get some healthy food in him, but he lies to me and says he’s eaten them, but then I see the food uneaten in the fridge next to the takeout he orders instead. I invite him for walks outside, for ice cream, to basically anything I am doing to help get him out of the house, but he says no. Each day he sleeps and watches tv, and I don’t think he does much else. 

He is on medication for depression and recently told me he also needs to go back on klonopin for his anxiety. I have tried setting him up with multiple therapists, but he has cancelled with all of them. I don’t know how to help and feel very lost. I struggle with depression myself, and have started to feel so sticky and heavy in my heart. My heart breaks for my dad, I have experienced first hand how cruel depression can be. 

I’m not sure how else to help him, what else I can do, I’m afraid I am going to lose him again. I’m the oldest daughter, and apart from my sister and I, there is no one else to care for my dad. I am really scared he is going to attempt suicide again, I feel very helpless and lost. I love my dad and I just want him to find whatever happiness and peace he can."	treedarling	post	26.790664677702342	female	White	0.9833614230155945	na	na	na	6	depression

"Aside from my immediate family (mom, brother, previously my father before he passed) I don’t care about anyone or what they’re going through.

Even if he was successful or if I found out he died right now I just wouldn’t care deep down, and again that goes for absolutely anyone that isn’t my mom or brother. 

Sometimes I talk to my mom about news like mass shootings, school shootings, suicides, etc and I act like I care to hold a conversation, but I really don’t care in the slightest.

Usually depression comes with not caring anymore . Not caring about goals, the small things and yes, even other people. The fact that you cared about them, but you don't give a rats ass about em anymore is just a consequence of your neurotransmitters being all fucked up.

"(29f) I have the wife (who I love deeply), the kids (they’re brats with behavioural issues but I also love them deeply), a home that I own and a great job, that pays great and I am treated very well there.

We moved away from my home town and away from all our friends and family, although they visit when they can, I think it’s loneliness I’m feeling but there’s something else I just can’t work out. 

I went out the other night with some new friends I made at work. It was great. I had the best time and I didn’t want it to end. My wife and I encourage each other to make time for friends and finding them because we are both in the same boat in that sense. The following days after going out, all I can feel is like a sense of missing out still and having no one and it’s something I can’t seem to shake for days. I work nights, so throughout the day you could say I’m alone although I spend most of the day sleeping. I’m starting to really despise going to work. I’ve been there 3 years and I shouldn’t have complaints about it because they are so good to me and the money pays the bills comfortably and I am in a team leader position. 

I do participate in doing party drugs (when my wife and kids are away, I have permission and people to enjoy them with) and we have a social drink now and then but once that’s over, I feel so down and I’m looking for the next good time I’m going to have. I don’t think I’m addicted to the party drugs or alcohol, because I don’t do them that often, my family and responsibilities are top of the priority list and I rarely miss a day of work. 

I love my family. Its not like I don’t want to be with them, I just don’t enjoy my life as much as I feel I should be. I don’t know what it is I can change because on the outside, looking in, everything is perfect. It’s just not exciting enough. I’m constantly thinking, there’s got to be more to life than just going through the motions. 

I feel so selfish. Anyone else feel the same?"	Construction_Queen	post	31.446264704730282	male	White	0.9934530258178711	na	na	na	2	depression
"You aren’t selfish. Sometimes the life script (kids, wife, good job) isn’t always as fulfilling as it is marketed to us. But you do have much to be grateful for. I work nights too and it is tiring for me, I find it hard to establish a healthy routine. I also struggle with having my own hobbies with I think correlate with a sense of self/mental health. Being lonely sucks too, so I understand you there.

It sounds like life is feeling stagnant for you, and you find excitement from going out and the unknowns tied to it. The hard part is, like you said, afterwards you feel worse. I’d be careful with drugs since they can be a slippery slope, and you can be experiencing a “comedown”. I don’t really know what advice I can offer you as someone who is struggling themselves, but maybe date nights with other couples if you can find a sitter would be good. Or more spontaneous activists with your spouse might fulfill you. Either way you aren’t selfish and seem to be a good spouse/provider and that’s more than most these days. Forgive yourself for those feelings, life can be stagnant and for someone who thrives almost in “chaos”/“adventures”.. it has been quite unfulfilling to me too recently."

I also have friends who commited in 4 years of university and changed career paths 5 years later and is now re entering school. Ive seen people with grey hair in the same uni classes as me.

Bottom line is there are a lot of options in education. If its truly too much to handle right now, its ok to take a break. You have the rest of your life to learn.

"Me: 52, hate my job, house, have no friends. Year after year after year is ticking away and nothing gets better. Just worse. Nothing is interesting. Nothing to look forward to. No meaningful connections. No family. Day after Day is boring at best and painful and depressing at worst. If you would have told me 5 years ago that it will actually be worse, I wouldn't have believed you. It had to get better. But it hasn't. 

At times I think.........I'm as strong as they come. Few could get up every day and keep pushing in this miserable existence. There's no point in it. Nothing changes. Everything pisses me off or is just uninteresting and tiring.

Other times I think.........Jesus I'm the weakest minded person imaginable. Grow up, get over it, find some happiness. Just go out and do it. Figure it out. You haven't always been miserable. Just the last 10 years or so. Get tough.

People in my boat.....Miserable and depressed with no real light showing at the end of the tunnel. Miserable and just existing.

I’m feeling the exact same way at 48.  No friends  anymore and nothing at all makes me happy or even is interesting to me.  I used to get really excited about things and go all in to accomplish them but now I can’t find it in me to really care about anything.  I’m in a similar situation it sounds like I finally got back into a house after divorce and was completely excited and proud of myself for it and that quickly faded.  Now o just see a lot of work.  I feel weak that’s for sure but I guess some people aren’t meant to have a good life.  I’m just trying to hang in there but it is definitely tough when you don’t feel a purpose.

You are definitely not a creep or weird, loneliness just does that to people. When we want the human affection that we can't receive, we look for alternatives using our imaginations to try to fill in the gaps in our souls. Unfortunately this only works as well as trying to fill a pot hole in the street with gorilla glue. We hate ourselves for creating these absurd fantasies but we often don't realize that it's just our brain trying to replicate real human connection with anything we have some sort of an affection towards. I have been guilty of doing this for years and so are many others so you aren't alone in that regard. Maybe it would help if you knew that the day you do share real connections with someone out there is the day that you'll let go of your imaginary partner. But until then don't feel weird.		reply	na	na	na	0.9986121654510498	weak	strong	no	na	depression

After I left that job a found another one where the boss was extremely racist. Both of these circumstances I had made complaints to hr with no repercussions. I've had abit of leave built up so I've been living off that.

 About 4 weeks ago I completely ran out of money. I have not paid rent, car payments, any bills or anything. I have been notified by the real estate agent that I have to pay rent or face eviction but I literally can't pay rent or anything as I've neglected my responsibilities. 

I've been eating leftover food from friends and family, nobody knows how broke I am because I don't leave my house. I have been really depressed since leaving my second job, I just can't find motivation to do anything.

"I (22F) feel so jaded about the world and scared. I don’t know how to get through it

I am a 22 year old woman who just graduated from undergrad and I’m starting graduate school at my dream school for a career I actually enjoy, but is a bit unstable, in about two weeks. Lately I’ve been feeling very depressed and scared about the state of the world.

I just moved to NYC where my grad school is and I live an hour commute from my school in a cheaper but more rough neighborhood. Every time I leave my apartment to do an errand it feels like something horrible happens. I get catcalled by creeps, or I stub my toe, I get locked out of my apartment by my new neighbors. I’ve started staying in because it feels like every time I go outside I have a hard day. In all fairness to the city, I have only been here for three weeks and I’m used to small town living, but it’s resulted in me spending a lot of my days while waiting to start school inside my apartment just depressed about the state of the world. 

Every time I go on social media, specifically tiktok, which I think I may be addicted to, I see so much sexism and pure hate for women, news about people dying, being murdered, robbed, raped, attacked by homeless people who are mentally ill. I feel like everyday I’m losing faith in humanity. I see News about tons of climate disasters like the wildfire in Canada and now Maui. I see News about rising housing costs everywhere, it seems like everyone in the world is being priced out of where they live, people applying to hundreds of jobs and not receiving any interviews even for jobs they’re qualified for, people losing their homes and becoming homeless, migrants flooding to other countries as a result of their corrupt governments giving them no choice but to leave, racism, homophobia, pure evil people like Ron Desantis running for President, people standing up for billionaires that are hoarding our wealth while we work ourselves to death, I’m so sick and tired and scared and I don’t know if it’s just because I have too much access to what is going on everywhere else in the world. I’ve tried deleting tiktok and not reading or watching the news but then I feel complicit, uninformed, and I miss some helpful information I should be aware of (like news of someone getting stabbed in the subway station I take to get home). 

I feel scared that I’m going into tons of student loan debt to get a masters degree and that might not even guarantee me a job or any job security when I finish when I was told going to college and becoming highly educated was a good way to get a good job. While I’m watching my roommates and close friends applying to hundreds of jobs over the past few months after undergrad graduation and it seems like nowhere is hiring and they’re getting scared they won’t be able to pay for rent next month.  

I’m scared that I’ll spend the time getting my masters degree just to graduate in three years and not be able to afford the absurd cost of housing and my loan repayments. I’m terrified that none of it will even matter because I might die early due to climate change. I’m so scared and I feel stuck and paralyzed and like nothings worth it. I feel constantly overwhelmed.

It’s starting to hit me also that life is just going to work to afford basic necessities and sometimes seeing your friends and family until you die and I feel like I’m having a complete breakdown where nothing feels like it matters, especially not my dream “career” or getting more schooling, or doing the hobbies I like because I might leave school in three years and not find a job and end up homeless and then eventually die because of climate change. I just really need advice and guidance because my friends are in the same position as me mentally and I have bad parents who have never been available to me emotionally, who don’t understand why this is all making me depressed because we’re immigrants and I currently have it “way better than my cousins back in my country”. They don’t understand that I’m scared that very soon I won’t because it’s hard to find a job, rent prices keep going up each year, and the planet is burning. I’m exhausted, I feel no hope, and I’m scared."	Much_Bee_1967	post	16.891109087448275	female	White	0.9945964217185974	na	na	na	1	depression

Title is pretty self explanatory. I have been clinically depressed for going on some years now and have made vast improvements. I have been described as currently in the pre action phase of getting my life together in some way or another. But something still feels disturbing to me, and that’s my inability to take a compliment, but also I feel threatened by it in the moment. It’s hard to describe but at work when I hear “nice job on x” it fills me with a brief amount of anger and I would say the most common reaction in my mind is that they are being pedantic, when I very well know they are not. I also have the common reaction of “I did what I was supposed too” and in my life that has never come with admiration, just acknowledgment of my completed task. This comes up in relationships too, if I cook a meal (something I am very good at) for a family or friends I very often feel a cringe when they say they enjoyed themselves. It’s hard to even describe the emotion I feel from it. I appreciate the words but ultimately they just bounce off of my chest and fall on the floor. I’m curious if anyone has felt the same way or has any advice for this trigger or if you were a person that never took compliments and learned to appreciate them.

"The only place I feel “free” and like myself is when I’m in my room with the door SHUT, away from the world and everything.

I wake up, have about 4 hours alone in my room until work starts. I go to work and just daydream about the moment I’ll be free again, when I’m off work and alone in my room.

"I don't know how long I've been depressed but I'd say at least 15 years. I've had a severe chronic illness for 30 years which leaves me mostly housebound, which has been the main cause of depression. But also other mental health issues which affect my life in a negative way. In recent years I've developed some other physical health issues, which whilst unrelated to my pre-existing chronic illness, they have made my chronic illness worse. 

I've always been a bit of a pessimistic person and defaulted to a negative outlook. Never had a strong will, purpose or focus in life. In my early 20's I had a bit of drive and desire but that eroded away after years of illness. I seem to be collecting new symptoms of late and it's feeding into my depression and ""What's the point"" attitude.

I can see this will be my life if I don't find a way to turn it around somehow. But any determination I manage to muster lasts about 5 minutes until some other minor thing goes wrong. I hate being like this but I just don't have the strength or drive to stop it. My chest feels under such a weight of anxiety, stress, depression that it takes a giant effort just to do basic things essential for living.

Realistically, life is going to get harder as time goes on as it has been doing for many years. Much of it is beyond my control (physical health, certain aspects of mental health) but I have to somehow find a way to turn around this depression because I can feel myself fading away into nothing."

for the past year or two i have been struggling with extreme social anxiety and no confidence. i’m at a point in my life where i have nothing to look forward to when school ends. all i do is try to get better at basketball. today my dad told me to just suck it up and stop depressing myself, like i haven’t been trying to do that. I’m not happy and i just want to be normal again.	PipSqueak_999	post	33.37100608034116	male	White	0.998121440410614	na	na	na	3	depression

"The last years of my life have made me feel depressed to the brink of suicide. I have kids, which is why no matter how bad I feel I won't harm myself. 

About 10 months ago I began using pot pretty much daily to cope with depression. My kids don't live with me so don't worry about me exposing them. I decided to quit smoking cold turkey about a week ago because I thought I wasn't achieving all I could achieve. But now the depression has come back worse.

I am lost now. I don't know how to find another way to relieve my depression or if what I'm feeling is the result of quitting pot. I did a little light reading and I see that there are not so many studies on mariguana withdrawal.

Nothing gives me joy. And I'm becoming asocial. People around me have stopped talking to me. I think because there's not much of me to entertain or interest other people. I don't enjoy gatherings, conversations, or parties because nothing gives me joy. I developed such a high tolerance to pot that no one could even tell when I had been smoking. Now I don't know if I should just hang on longer to overcome depression or if I should get back on pot. I know it sounds like I'm rationalizing going back to my drug, which is why I'm putting this out here. Maybe someone out there can enlighten me a bit more on what should I expect one way or another.

"This was going to be the best summer of my life, after a year spent working hard and doing a lot of overtime I managed to save up a lot of money. So a few month ago I organized with a girl I really really like (and basically my only friend) to spend two weeks together at the beach. 

She would have come here with her parents (she's still underage) and I would have come here alone. Same hotel and very close on the beach. God I planned everything and I offered to pay for her whole stay (around 1k)

Then, a few days before leaving, she told me she got really really bored of me and basically to fuck off from her life. That destroyed me, she was the only thing left I had and she decided to cut it off 

So now I'm here, one week in, one week to go, suffering and hating me. The only thing I did was being there for her whenever she needed me and she decided to throw me away like I was some kind of trash 

I have to see her everyday, at breakfast, lunch, dinner and on the beach. I see her happy, living her life. And I see myself sad and depressed, I just want to go home. I tried to hurt myself but failed miserably, which made me even worse

I don't know what to do, what should have I done differently. It just hurts...i lived my whole life in pain and I thought she was different but I was wrong...it's always my fault"	DaviLance	post	14.655775864985044	male	White	0.9992995262145996	na	na	na	9	depression

Coming from a girl that has been in a few relationships, I promise you that your dating life has the potential to get better. I remember having my self esteem broken numerous times while dating on tinder (because I'm incredibly introverted) and I've learned it takes time to match with someone that is highly similar to you. For example having ADD, and other disorders, I have learned that I often get along very well with others that have the same. Heartbreak is a very traumatic and painful thing to overcome, but once you give yourself that permission to try again and envision a future that makes you happy, it makes it easier to let yourself heal.

 I remember a quote from a therapist ""living is just not for everyone""
I don't  care about money or food or clothes or people.

I was born like this....living is so hard man.

All I wish for is getting a good job ,saving good chunk of  money which I would send over to my t old parents so that I wouldn't feel guilty before I  put a gun in my mouth .

My daily schedule is pretty much get up go to work and come home lay in bed for hours staring at a blank word document trying to finish a book so I can follow my dreams. But, I find I’m too drained even though I haven’t put much energy into anything really. My sleeping schedule is either I sleep for 3 hours or 12-15 hours if Its my day off. I don’t aspire for a relationship and have no friends just my two cats which I’m content with but I don’t know what else I can do to help change my routine. I feel like my life is a ticking clock and i have  wasted so much time In bed already.  It would be a shame if I looked back in 20-40 years and realized I’m still in bed.

"Long story short I moved out of my mom's house when I was 19, my whole childhood pretty much she struggled with depression and never got help or would acknowledge it was depression.
This did cause issues in our relationship.
Fast forward to last year 6 years after I moved out I get diagnosed with several medical conditions including POTs and long covid, I'm passing out a lot due to the POTs and injuring myself. Finally passed out in the middle night and injured myself pretty badly, nobody knew until the following morning because I lived alone.
After this scare I decided to quit my full time job doing physical labor and get remote job, and go back to live with my mom so I wouldn't be alone most of the time if I have a medical emergency I'll have help.
Even though we were in close contact the whole time I lived on my own I didn't know how bad her depression had truly gotten until I moved in with her.
At this point I do all the cleaning or the house would be filthy because she doesn't clean.
I do all the cooking or else she just doesn't eat or eats things like kids lunchables for dinner.
I don't necessarily even mind doing those things as she works full time and I only work part time and she refuses to let me pay her for rent. It's just sad to think she probably lived that way for years before I was around to notice it. What i have a hard time handling is her poor mood.
She barely ever talks to me, she never thanks me for anything or seems to notice or appreciate any of the hard work I put in the meals or the house. She doesn't even acknowledge it.
And half the time when she does talk all she talks about is how much she hates her life, how she doesn't want to be here anymore.
I've tired talking to her about it, I've encouraged her to seek help and nothing ever changes. 
She won't get help and I don't know how to help her anymore.
I'm at a complete loss and her depression is making me extremely depressed too."	-mykie-	post	29.933527941324535	male	White	0.99883633852005	na	na	na	1	depression
"It looks like life is telling you that you have some unfinished business. That there is a tough situation, I'm in one myself, although I'm not half the decent human being you are; I'm more like your mom. I guess that makes me Team Mom. On the outside, you may see the story of a mean old hag, but who knows what goes on inside.  
Now, I don't know your mom, but I sure know depression. When you've adopted the 'fuck my life' attitude, you throw out the social rule book and prioritize short-term pleasure. Long-term goals like staying healthy by eating full-course meals are not a priority anymore; what is is stopping hunger.

As for helping her, I don't think anything special is required. Just patience and care. And you're already doing it, but now with this new understanding, your care is more aligned with the truth and therefore bound to show results.

"A week ago I tried to OD and as soon as I took that action, I immediately regretted it. It’s like I suddenly came to my senses and became an outsider looking in and I knew it was the absolute wrong decision to make. Something kept telling me to give life another chance. I was in the hospital for a few days, I got out and I’m back home now. 
Seeing the pain of my family thinking they’re going to lose me, is absolutely not worth it and made me feel so selfish and like a bad person. Seeing and knowing all the consequences that would follow from an attempt, is absolutely not worth it and can put you in a worst state than before. 
I was sitting in my hospital bed alone and knew deep down god saved me from this for a reason and gave me a second chance at life. I don’t know what the reason is yet…however I felt like it was a miracle. A way to have a new beginning.

It's getting bad again, I am feeling worse than ever. It's like I feel so lonely and bored that It feels like i am trapped in this meaningless world forever. I feel suicidal, I really really want to kill myself but I somehow can't do It. I am extremely frustrated. I try to do things to distract myself, such as hanging out with random people from dating apps, because I have no friends. But my mum wants to control everything I do and I have to lie and say im hanging out with some old friends. And i hate lying, so I end up staying home everytime. I wish my therapist was here to confort me, but im all alone now and I will end up hurting myself again or  smoking or idk. I'm really desperate.

"I’m 36, in debt, with no work and no friends aside from a girlfriend who lives long distance and who I see once a year. 

I’ve got Crohn’s Disease, Depression, Anxiety and I’m a complete loser who has nothing going for him, and who is just a burden.

My closest shot at a meaningful life was 8 years ago, when I graduated from college with honours. I pictured a life with the girl I love, a successful career, and being able to allow my parents to enjoy retirement without having their adult son live at home and be a burden.

Now I’m 36, still living at home, haven’t worked in years, and I’m so lost. If this is my life, I don’t want it anymore. I don’t know what to do, or where to go, or how to get back on track if it’s even possible.  At this point, I will never be able to get a job that pays well enough to live in the same place as my girlfriend, who is the only reason aside from my family that I’m still here. 

I’ve worthless, and at my age, I don’t think there’s a chance at a good life anymore. 

I don’t really know why I’m posting here to be honest. I’ve just exhausted all options, and I’m lost and needed to vent. 

I’m sorry for being a bother."	FalloutShelter76	post	36.25651744953701	male	White	0.9991704225540161	na	na	na	4	depression
"Reading this after I just posted myself. And idk if this is going to be worth reading, but hear me out...

Seems like when I look at your fight and compare it with mine, there's a common denominator in the large dissonance between expectation vs reality. I'm somewhat self-aware, and that has shown me, along with feedback from others and actual accomplishments, that I have potential for success in life. I could see where my life could go and I know I can get there. 

The problem has always been execution. Not acting on a good thought, idea or opportunity quick enough and after some time, allowing judgment of that to start and eat away at my confidence. This causes more of that same behavior. 

If you lived entirely in the present and stopped having expectations of yourself, how would that look? You don't have kids and you're not married, so what's at stake? I say this while also kinda saying it to myself.  But really, what do we have to lose? 

Is it that we are hopeless or is it that we think we deserve more than what we've worked for? Is that we want a life that we know we can have, but haven't done all that's necessary? 

Idk man. I could be way off base and apologize if I am, but we aren't dead yet and haven't failed so hard that we don't have a time to actually have that life we think we deserve. 

At some points in my life, I've landed here and honestly just did a hard reset. I scaled back my life and removed all expectation of being a normal adult. Accept the debt, the bad credit, the health baseline and living situation as just being there. Granted there is no major illness, all of those things are really not perceivable unless you compare yourself to others, right? 

Let's maybe find a way to simplify? I think...nah, I know we still have time to be more than this."	FalloutShelter76	reply	na	na	na	0.9991704225540161	weak	strong	no	na	depression

"I understand how life could break you in your circumstance. It's a tough world out there.

There are many opportunities everyday, and so many difficult decisions to make, one path or another. It can be overwhelming in the moment. And even more overwhelming is the feeling of regret, thanked by the 20/20 vision through hindsight we unfortunately have. Maybe we both have felt that.

On top of it all there are so many expectations laid on us. These expectations are laid on us by ourselves, and by friends, family, peers, and sometimes it can seem that all society places an expectation onto us.

But, through that all, you still have not given up. You have exhausted all options as you say. Which means tomorrow you can be met with more opportunities and difficult decisions to make. Some you may regret, and some you may not. You can do this my friend. I know you don't regret loving your girlfriend and family.

"Hey, listen.
Life is hard, I agree with that one but you are stronger than that. For 3 years, I struggled with depression and still today but everything's getting better but very slowly. 

You might feel like nothing is getting better throughout the years, that's called depression. You don't have to blame yourself for that. Please know that you are not alone, I've gone through that too. I thought I didn't have any future, I wasn't thinking about the future actually.

Depression is a mental illness which is indeed very hard of getting rid off. That is why you must not be alone fighting depression, you need supportive people around you. You need to put yourself first no matter what. 

I of course don't know the root of your problems and I'm not a specialist, just a regular student but depression will always make you believe that nothing will get better when it is false. 

Medication helped a lot in fighting my depression, and also music (strange isn't it). By resting a lot, putting myself first, trying to do solo activities that I used to enjoy helped me. I'm not saying that these things healed me but just helped me.

I honestly hope that you will fight depression, that everything will get better and that you will finally be able to enjoy your life, because you deserve it. You are strong, don't give up. :)"	Alarming-Mistake683	reply	na	na	na	0.9994633793830872	weak	strong	no	na	depression

"Been contemplating weather to post this but better say something. And before you say ""try therapy"" i am currently in it but with my financials it might not last long


This is my third time doing it. It first started arounf freshman or sophomore year highschool on my hands, kinda like i wanted people to notice. I reached out and got help. It worked for a bit and stopped but around senior year i started up again in a more sucluded spot but got cought and was put back in therapy. I stopped after highschool and i felt ok and just better for about 5 years

But now ive started again. Ive been going through mental torture. At first it was because i was just so sad and lonely, id sit there with the knife in my hand and just cried. But now im just angry at my self. I hate that i feel this way because i feel i dont deserve to. Im not going through war, or a disaster, or a terrible disease, im still young, my life isnt that bad, im just being a fuckin baby and having these stupid feelings. My feelings dont matter. I just get so angry. When i cut it doesnt bleed that much if at all because i have a good amount of scar tissue so i get even more angry and anoyyed at my self cause i cant even bleed right.

And just because you aren't going through a war or an illness etc doesn't mean your feelings aren't valid. I totally get you feeling that way but your feelings matter, no matter what they are. 

I'm glad you are getting therapy and i really hope it helps as long as finances allow.

I understand the feeling of craving the pain, almost like you can phantom feel it before it even happens. I just want you to know that Long-Term Happiness is real.

"On some level you have to realize that feelings are not the only important thing in the world.  If you harm your physical self, all you do is make your body less capable of doing its job.  If you break your personal belongings out of anger or frustration, you simply deny yourself nice things and further hobble your ability to feel good about the world since you would be sitting on a pile of rubble and junk in the end.

You don't need to know why you are doing that.  You just need to stop.  On some level you already know why you did what you did anyhow.  Don't lie to yourself.  Frustration and anger about depression or something you view as not changing.  

Try some deep breathing exercises in a park setting or someplace nice.  Go for a walk in the sun.  Watch some calming and pleasing ASMR on YouTube while relaxing and doing deep breathing exercises.

Hello I am new to this but I just wanted a place to vent anonymously. I am a 23 year old male. I just got out of a year long relationship. My first one involving kids twins to be exact. I fell in head over heels for a woman with twins. I invested my time sweating money and tears into this relationship. I let my own house go to shit over how much I was with her trying to help and advance our life together. I really thought this could be the one. Long story short we broke up a month ago and I’ve been in a depression slump since. I’m back at my house it’s wrecked I had dishes piling up the grass wasn’t cut months. I can’t see the kids anymore me and there mom can’t even talk without fighting. It sucks bc they were great and I loved them to death. On top of that I found out my truck is rotting out and is becoming to dangerous to drive. My plumbing broke on me the other day too.

It's just as the title says, I have no reason to be depressed. I have two very loving and supportive parents who make decent money. I never been bullied, and usually had at least a couple of friends. I don't currently have any friends though. There have been no traumatic incidents in my life ever. But everyday I am miserable. I constantly think of suicide. I don't know what to do. I feel like there is no problem to fix. I have tried therapy, but I felt like my therapist just offered generic advice I could get with a google search. I was also examined and told I don't need any antidepressants. I just want to feel better, but I don't know what to do if I don't even know if I'm depressed.

"It‘s typical for depression that you do not need a reason. It‘s true, that depressions sometimes rise from difficult life conditions or that you can see from where they come, but sometimes they hit out of nowhere. They‘re an illness and nothing someone has to be ashamed about it.

What kind of therapies are available for you? There are different types out there. If it did not work out with your therapist, maybe you should consider another therapist or a different kind of therapy?
And if you have tried everything else, than antidepressants should be the way (but in accordance with professional advice, will maybe take some time to find the right one)."	Bowser_God	reply	na	na	na	0.9987196922302246	weak	no	no	na	depression

"I have already posted and don't want to beat a dead horse, but I'm in serious need of advice as it relates to having depression as a sales professional. I've never seen success like I have over the last year and found a legitimately good company to work for that is ethical and pays well. In the last 3 months, in spite of fighting it with medication, diet, exercise, etc., the depression came back on the heels of a slow month in the industry. 

I've since lost confidence in myself and the procrastination got so bad that I'm failing on project management as well as actual sales. I feel this opportunity crumbling in front of me and have been unable to do much to save myself.

Hey folks, I was hoping to get some life advice from you guys. I’m _tired_. Tired of trying different antidepressants. Tired of striving. Tired of living. Tired of being anxious and comparing myself to other people. Tired of not having friends/a social life. I switched to new meds two weeks ago and I think the withdrawal caused an increase in suicidal thoughts. I started looking into all kinds of alternative supplements and other drugs/treatments that could help because I’m tired of having no energy during the day, having brain fog, waking up feeling like I’m an old man and all my joints ache (I’m in my mid twenties). The more time passes the more drastic changes I want to make. What do I do with my life? Sorry for the general question, I don’t know how else to pose it.	trowauay	post	44.22000520744696	female	White	0.9939060807228088	na	na	na	1	depression
"There are no easy solutions to any of it, unfortunately, other than enacting changes in your lives that you want; E.G., pursuing a social life that you want, preventing yourself from over-thinking, etc. Obviously, it's much easier said than one, but you can certainly exert control over your brain in regards to feeling anxious (depending on the cause, but distracting your brain by making it focus on other things tends to work), etc.

So, the question is, what do you want from your life? Laying it all out, and if need be, planning steps that you can take, which can help with actually doing it, especially since you won't have to think about it and when it comes to actually doing it.

Also, you might wanna try some magnesium supplements. They should be able to help."	trowauay	reply	na	na	na	0.9939060807228088	weak	no	no	na	depression
"Hello all, I'm a 21 year old male college student and have dealt with depression and anxiety for most of my life. For the most part, I've always had a decent support system; I can talk with my family and see a counselor and psychiatrist that currently prescribes me fluloxetine. But last year, I lost several friends, went through a bad breakup, and basically, kind of lost my course in life. My major in college is arts-related and I begun to doubt myself and question my place in the field after already dedicating years of my life to it. The combination of these things put me on a downward spiral. I began to isolate myself from others, skip classes and important events, and began using weed much more (I have smoked regularly for several years now but my dependence on it deepened during this time). I avoided all my problems and anything that could potentially cause more problems. I also started dealing with intrusive thoughts of suicidal ideation and began to plan. I went through my state's processes to buy a handgun but never went as far as actually getting one. I just felt so incredibly alone. My family noticed how distant I had been and offered to pay for my counseling. I told them I was struggling, but not the impulses I had been feeling, and when I started seeing my counselor, I didn't tell her either. I didn't want people to worry about me, but I also couldn't swallow my pride.

Over time and with support, things have gotten much better for me. Counseling helped tremendously. Some of my old friendships were healed, and I have an action plan for the next few years. That being said though, I still have intrusive suicidal thoughts. They are much more rare, but now that I'm feeling happier, they're a lot scarier to deal with. I don't want to think that way anymore--that when something goes wrong or I'm feeling excessively anxious, I can just give up and fade away. I see the worth in myself now, but these thoughts make me question if I really am better. I guess what I'm asking is if this is something anyone else has dealt with. I don't feel comfortable bringing this up to family, friends, or my doctors. How can I make suicide not seem so palatable? 

Thanks"	abiggestmistake	post	23.43334503816888	female	White	0.006499849259853363	na	na	na	0	depression

"When your depression gets so bad it’s debilitating, forcing you to stay in bed/on the couch, what do you wish others (i.e. the people/person you live with) would do for you as they witness you spiraling into a dark place?

"If they don’t understand mental illness, I predict judgement and all the crappy platitudes people say, “just think happy thoughts”, “do some exercise”, “just snap out of it”, “happiness is a choice”, blah blah blah bullshit bullshit bullshit. If they understand mental illnesses, it is more likely “what can I do to help” but they might not know how to ask. After my brother-in-law said “you just need to get a job and you will be fine”, I realised a lack of understanding. 

I changed my approach from waiting for an offer, to asking for help and finding short YouTube videos and one page credible Government fact sheets that credibly explained how debilitating mental illnesses are. I also changed to asking for help, even things as simple as “can you please make me a cup of tea?”. 

While I didn’t want to, I have to admit some educated offers helped. So, instead of my wife saying, “it is a lovely day, you should take the dog for a walk, it will do you good”, which just pissed me off (even though I knew deep down it would help), she totally changed her approach to “it is a lovely day, why don’t we take the dog for a short walk together”. The difference on the surface is subtle but the actual difference is huge. There is no judgement, no patronising “it will do you good”, it was supportive because “let’s go together” and as such, as much as I wanted to stay in bed, I went. It did me good and my wife was supportive of us just going around the block. Routine is one of the critical aspects of getting out of a funk, so we now go for a walk everyday with the dog and have increased the time out and have even walked to a coffee shop sometimes. 

So with that support rather than “you should” or “get off the fucking couch and do something”, we are developing routines. She doesn’t say “you haven’t showered or cleaned your teeth for five days”, she will say, “I need to wash the towels, if you shower now I can put the washing on”.  I think it is all about understanding and how it is communicated. I am a musician and my wife provides positive encouragement to get up and do some music. Again, no “you should get up and play some music, it will do you good”, my wife might say “I haven’t heard you play your (insert specific instrument) for a while, I would love to hear you play it for 5 or 10 minutes”. So, short time therefore, it is an achievable goal which is not overwhelming. My wife knows that the likelihood is I will play for longer is high but I am not overwhelmed with expectations, so more likely to get out of bed. I am a multi instrumentalist so she also takes another decision making variable out of the equation by specifying an instrument. Some instruments require less concentration than others and she will generally choose one of them, knowing that if I get into musical “flow”, multiple instruments will end up getting played. 

My wife is now, well we could get into a routine where we take the dog for a walk, have a coffee and then at some point in the day, you could program in music practice. It is a really good approach one bite at a time. At some point, more bites will get dropped in like house chores and shaving is something I don’t do when I don’t want to move or music tutoring."

"I’ve failed at every step in my life. I’ve continuously been given opportunities that I take for granted. My first and only girlfriend loved me for 6 years but I led us both down a path of alcohol abuse and mutually physical arguments. She would hit me over and over but even one strike in self defense from me is devastating to someone as small as her. It got to the point that my actions destroyed the love she had for me. She was so patient and gave me so many chances to correct my behavior and actions before it escalated but I didn’t. I was hired last year at a great job and I started getting greedy and took it for granted so my performance plummeted and I lost my job. 

I don’t feel sorry for myself, they were decisions I made myself. 

But once I discovered my ex had moved on and found another man it devastated me. 2 years ago we were planning out timelines to get married and have kids. 

This broke me for about 2 months and then I started to feel better, that I could take this opportunity to be the best person I can be. 

Though these last few weeks I have begun dreaming about her again and the life I destroyed. The children that we would have had, and the mistakes I made at my job before being laid off. 

The energy has been sucked from my body that not even adderall can get me out of bed. 

I moved back in with my mother and she is already kicking me out because I can’t keep my room clean properly. It was spotless for months but I fell back into my depression. 

I’m so lonely and I feel like I’ve already thrown my life away. Even if I correct it and find someone else this will always haunt me. I’m afraid I’ll be 60 with grandkids and still think about these last two years and how the trajectory of my life was changed because of my own actions.

Not long ago, I decided it was enough and went to see a psychiatrist who diagnosed me and put me on Prozac for long-term treatment. I do feel better and less overwhelmed overall. The treatment was a godsend.

I still have some difficulties with motivation. I can't get myself to do some work or read books although I'm very interested in them. I also have an issue with hygiene such as showering on a regular basis

"I’m never going to leave this house. I’m never going to have enough finances to do it. I feel like I’ve worked so hard to the point of work being debilitating and emotionally damaging and this is how I’m rewarded. I try to stick up for my mental health by saying no to emotionally damaging things and my shifts are taken away. I hate my boss so much. :( I don’t want to work anymore… if this is how I’m treated.

I’m never going to get what I want. Never able to escape.

I just want to leave this house…. :( every time I see my mums face I get angry. I remember getting hurt every time I see her. I feel so miserable and angry. I remember when I was a teen, I was hurt so bad I smeared my blood all over the walls and wrote “help me”. She got so mad at me and beat me up and forced me to paint it white. We sold the house and I wonder if they know blood used to be under the sickeningly white paint.

Every time I see her face I remember those words. The feeling of being perpetually nauseating in an endless loop is tiring.

 My mum doesn’t hurt me anymore but she says comments every day, and if wears down at me. I no longer have patience and just want to leave.

I should just end life to stop my suffering. I’ve been fantasising about it but I’m so chicken to do it. I couldn’t even self harm myself. I would stop this suffering. The thing is I was cured from depression for so many years. It’s come back and it’s gnawing at me every day, eating at my insides. It’s making me more tired and sad.

My friends, sister, dog and partner are the only thing that are keeping me here. My partner is like a breath of happiness and I always feel safe and at ease with him. I just want to be with him every day but I’m realising it’s not as viable as I initially thought. 

 I think they wouldn’t want me to suffer day after day. 

I think they’d want me to be at peace.

My situation is quite complicated. I have been depressed for the past 2 years. My depressive episodes tend to fluctuate where at least 3-4 months of the year I go into very major depression (cant get out of bed, poor appetite, no desire to socialize, poor hygiene habits, substance abuse, no desire to do uni work, suicidal thoughts, etc.). the other months, I am still depressed, but able to mask it better yet still get comments from those around me saying i feel off. I am really not good at talking about my feelings and cannot put them into words so this post may seem surface level but I have genuinely been suffering for the past 2 years. I did therapy march-may of last year. It didnt help. I was told I may have bipolar type 2 but once the talk about mood stabilizers and medication came to place, I panicked and immediately stopped therapy. My issue is relying on medication scares me. I’m afraid to come to terms that I am so messed up in the head that i need a pill to fix me. My mother takes xanax and SSRIs and I see how dependent she’s become on them and it breaks my heart. Unfortunately, it has been getting so bad to the point where i feel that medication is my only solution. I have made an effort to improve myself. I stopped drinking for good, i haven’t smoked weed in almost 2 months, i have surrounded myself around family, but nothing seems to work. I get caught up in my thoughts constantly, its hard to sleep, and i keep to myself which makes it so hard. It is genuinely the hardest thing in the world for me to open up about how i feel. My parents know something is wrong but every time they try to talk to me about it I completely shut myself out and say “im fine, dont worry about me.” I have been having thoughts of self harm. Today I forced puked for the first time in months. My heart is in constant pain, I have no desire to socialize or see anyone and no one understands that I am suffering. All people tell me is I dont make enough effort to see them when it is really just me suffering in silence. I recently came back from a trip and the last 2 weeks felts like I was on a rush - constantly going out and partying (but not drinking) and having the energy to do so much. I was sleeping at 7 am every night. Now I am just tired and cannot bare the pain anymore. I really need help. I’ve thought about therapy again but I am scared. I feel like even therapy wont fix me because it didnt before. I dont know what to do, I dont want any sympathy from anyone, I just wanna be myself again. I came here as a final resort because I get to talk about it anonymously, I hope it helps.	RandomBoy214	post	26.1636391943694	male	White	0.9959456324577332	na	na	na	4	depression
"If your depression has a cyclic pattern then I would be careful as it can indeed be bipolar type 2.

Please see a psychiatrist because whether you are clinically depressed or you are bipolar, it's not a good situation. And if you are bipolar the odds of managing it without medication are slim.

Ps: I don't mean to discourage you, but if it's bipolar, brace yourself."	RandomBoy214	reply	na	na	na	0.9959456324577332	no	no	no	na	depression

I have been dealing with depression since I was really small. Two years ago, a psychiatrist gave me some pills. I was on them for a year, that year was better, I felt less, life was more bearable, but after I stopped the treatment because they thought I was okay then, I still had depression. If you think that taking them is going to make you feel good enough to make the necessary changes in your life to be happy or, at least, okay in the future, then medication will work great for you.

Sweetly if that wasn’t a sexual thing you were both into you need to 1. Leave and 2. If you have any marks whatsoever go to the cops. Sounds like you could use some DV help if your still calling him your Boyfriend after her basically threatened to kill you. Do you have anyone who maybe you could stay with? Check where you live some places offer free counseling for things like this and there are groups. They tend to also be able to help find you temporary housing please use all resources available. I know depression makes it hardest of all to help yourself but find a group a counselor something to get some guidance on moving forward.

i’m 20 years old. i’ve had depression my whole life but when it was the worst i didn’t do anything besides sleep, eat and go to school. that includes everything hygiene related, i simply didn’t have the energy. because that lasted so long, i never really learned how to incorporate new things i need to do, like brushing my teeth. i’ve always hated it and it’s something i forget to do so often. i’ve had one cavity now and been seeing a dentist every year. i’m on a throwaway account because all of this is simply way too embarrassing. i hate that i don’t brush my teeth but i can almost never seem to bring myself to actually do it. i’ve tried setting reminders on my phone, putting sticky notes in the bathroom, keeping my toothbrush my bed. nothing has seemed to work, i just keep convincing myself i’ll be ok but i know i won’t be. i would really appreciate some help, thank you.	josh_holden11	post	22.936679242123642	female	White	0.9975695013999939	na	na	na	3	depression
For starters I’m genuinely sorry about what you’ve gone through all this while but please know that none of this-NONE- is embarrassing. The inability to pull yourself up to do basic stuff like brushing your teeth is in fact a very common symptom of depression. Is it something you forget to do or something you can’t get yourself to do? If it’s the latter, what worked for me was preserving minimal hygiene during my depressive episode. I’d have some mouthwash next to my bed simply because gargling seemed like an easier ordeal than brushing. Granted, it isn’t a long term solution but tiny steps can make you feel hella better and refreshed.

"Title is one of emotion more than explanation. I can't get a proper job. 

My education didn't finish, covid ruined my work on a bachelors thesis and my attempts to fix it afterwards have failed. I burnt my student funds on side courses trying to finish the bachelors. 

I didn't.

I am living in a student apartment that was a mess. For the last year I have lived basically alone because changing roommates who nevwr stayed. Shared spaces were a mess. New roommate came when I was sick. I felt so guilty yet they cleaned it all, got new furniture. Made it look decent. 

Here I am unable to fix that in three years time.

I haven't properly functioned since 2019. Uni has been some of the best years in my life. Getting away from home, meeting friends. Now my student funds are up. I don't have my bachelors in history so no jobs immediately. Friends are still going through that. Managing better. Dreams of the future. Remaining friends who failed bachelors have finished it now. Except me.

Decided to search jobs as I failed two courses due to relatives funerals. Move out. Try to live on my own properly and earn my own money. Got a job at a restaurant with red flags and no promise of proper work. Other workplaces don't want me.

Money is running out. 

I am sick and useless and stuck at home.

I have never had sex or been in a relationship.

Even if I could be in a relationship I can never bear childre .

I am fat and overweight.

I had mild promise that I squandered.

Turning 25.

Couldn't finish my studies.
Couldn't keep my body healthy.
Couldn't follow ambitions.
Couldn't learn an instrument. 
Couldn't even keep writing properly despite wanting to write something.
Couldn't even transition properly.

Can't maintain regular things at all. Be it voice training, diet, room cleanliness, decent sleeping routines.

Honestly I fucked up. I feel like I picked every wrong choice possible.

Nobody wants me in reality, ultimately I just break or harm stuff and people.

i am not even sure i want to live anymore.

i can't handle being this much of a fucking disgrace.

i am pathetic enough to go vent here because nobody should have to be burdened by me yet i burden strangers online.

i cant see hope right now. i ruined it and its my fault.  

all of it is my fault.

I feel that man, I really do. I sometimes wonder what's broken in me to just not get ahead with anything. Money, love, etc. The answer to my long asked question is that there ISN'T anything broken. It doesn't seem like it, when we look out our windows and watching the world melt into chaos. It took me a long time to find and fix the most basic shit. You know what? I'm okay with that. Things take time. A phrase I don't like to hear myself, knows... Regardless, things still take time whether I like it or  not. You aren't pathetic nor an excuse, you're just human. We all are. I wish I could tell yeah it'll fix itself, but I can't. I made that mistake before. Thought those words would help. They did not. My point is... We just have to take our time and fix things one by one. Stop overwhelming yourself. It's hard, you feel like you can just hold the world while healing, but you can't. Get out and just slow down and breathe. Hear the sounds of nature and calm yourself. Get into the right mindset and then get to work fixing things. I'm young, but I'm learning. Just personal experience I guess. Everybody is different, do things that make you happy and calm. I genuinely hope not just you, but everyone here including me, figure our shit out.

It's hard learning it on your own. Heck, sometimes it feels near impossible. While It's sad your parents died without being there now... you are still here. And that means YOU need to parent yourself. Asking yourself if you are hungry, need a hug, go to bed, make the right choice. And it's fuuucking hard without someone else guiding us. It's harsh.

Also don’t beat yourself up for feeling like you need to be taken care of, you’ve spent most of your life caring for your parents and that takes it toll. It’s hard to look after ourselves when we feel so empty. I cared for my mum until a few years ago and although I wouldn’t ever change that, it did/has taken so much from me. I’m slowly learning to take care of myself but it’s not easy. My therapist said when I’m feeling really lonely to press one hand where my heart is and another on my stomach and the pressure replicates the feeling of being hugged. It helps when I miss my mum and just want a hug from her.
I know you don’t want to ask you sister or friends to take care of you but it might be helpful to explain how you’re feeling to them, just so they’re aware. 
Practically, if you find the thought of feeding yourself overwhelming then things like pre-made meals might help. There are some which are nutritious and you can just pop in the oven/microwave or you can get meal kits delivered to your home with the instructions and ingredients if you do feel like trying to cook. 
Learning to parent yourself takes time so be kind to yourself and gradually you’ll understand what you need."	willcaro61	reply	na	na	na	0.9965079426765442	weak	no	strong	na	depression

You need someone who will listen to you. And life will continue, trust me it is not impossible, i didnt even think that my depression would pass, im still a little bit depressed sometimes but for the most parts, i try to distract myself with something, but distractions as drugs and alcohol, they are only going to make things worse.

I'm so very sorry. I'm sure you've heard it a million times, but you need to hear it till you feel the truth in your bones: that you are one brave young woman. You have every right to grieve. You deserve to be cared for, even if it's for a short period of time. You say you are suffering from depression: I know from personal experience that grief and depression are two different, but exquisitely painful things, and that it is possible to experience them both, together. So I hope you are getting professional help for depression. If not, I would suggest you seek that help. As part of your therapy, you might be able to work out a plan where you are looked after, even if it's for a little while, by your sister or a trusted friend. I hope you are able to take at least the first step towards reaching out for help. The rest will follow.	willcaro61	reply	na	na	na	0.9965079426765442	strong	no	no	na	depression
"❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹 I honestly could have written this post about myself. I grew up with just my mom, and I took care of her until she passed from cancer when I was in my very early 20s. I’m 30 now and I still struggle to be functional. I’ve had so much help from friends, but it’s embarrassing and I don’t feel like I deserve it. My biggest piece of advice is being really open about how you are feeling. When I express how disappointed I am in myself and how I feel like I’m failing and a burden on people around me, I’m always reminded of some of the awful shit I’ve been through. I can’t take care of myself either, and it’s frustrating. You aren’t alone and I am sure you aren’t doing as poorly as you think. I’m sorry you’re feeling this way, but I’ll just share what my friends always tell me. 

You’ve been through more than most people in their 40s can imagine. Going through what you have, it makes sense that you may struggle to find your footing on your own. When people hear your story and look from the outside, they see someone who is strong, in pain, and trying their best to make it through. You’ve taken care of others for so long, it only makes sense that you are feeling like you need taken care of. Nothing about the way you are feeling is unexpected or irrational - given your circumstances, it’s exactly how you would expect someone to feel. 

I hope this helps. I’m going through the exact same thing right now, but I’m very hopeful that we will both make it through ❤️

Edit to add: you also bring love and happiness to the people around you. There is so much more to you than what you’ve been through. I miss my mom so much and every day I wish I could talk to her so she could tell me everything will be okay. The closest I can get is guessing what she would say to me, and that is comforting, too."	willcaro61	reply	na	na	na	0.9965079426765442	no	strong	no	na	depression
"I agree. You must parent yourself. I had an ex girlfriend in a similar situation and while I took care of her as much as I could, she had to learn to parent herself too. Both of us were battling mental health issues and it was too much for me to take care of both of us, so I told her what I did. Am I hungry? Am I tired? What would make me feel better right now? I got a meal planner on Amazon and made the whole weeks meals on it and then ordered groceries. We’re not together anymore but are still good friends and she still does this. 
I know it’s hard to take care of yourself when you’re depressed, but it’s one of the few things that can actually make you feel better. 

I have anxiety and depression and I tend to isolate myself. That’s actually why I was scrolling through this subreddit: I’m also feeling down and kind of wanted to hear from others who “get it” right now.

I think the one thing I didn’t realize about adult life is how lonely it can get. When you’re a kid you’re always around others and there were always people you could talk to, but as an adult you can choose your situation and you can just check out of society if you want. I work from home, am working my way through online grad school, and I rarely leave my house. I don’t know how I got so isolated.

I compare it with a high appartement room on fire; and only a window to escape from. No one wants to go out of the window, yet the flames burn nevertheless.

"My mom died of cancer years ago. To console me and reassure me of her love, she left little notes hidden in different places: Books, jewelry box, movie cases, tea tins. 
She died over 5 years ago but I still find her notes to me. 

Today I found one of her notes that says ''You were the most wanted child in the world, and I'll always love you Britney"". 

I broke down and cried for like an hour. The pain never leaves even and I get depressed over her death sometimes, but these wonderful surprises keep me going.

The negative thoughts are trying to take over again and I’m simply exhausted from trying to fight. Why am I never enough? I always end up back in this place no matter the changes I make or the hard things I do. They say doing hard things makes us stronger but in my case it just makes me want to crumble.

"I've been depressed for over 6 years, contemplated commiting suicide for 3 years now. The past few months I have been thinking that it is going to be my answer. But today, I listened to the words of someone I respect (they aren't alive anymore *not suicidal tho*). I still want to commit suicide, but at the same time, I feel like I would be doing them wrong by going through with it.

I want to end it all because I feel like won't be able to live a life that I can enjoy. I know things in life won't go your way all the time, but some of the things I want for my life to be enjoyable just aren't possible in this life. Also, everyday whenever my brain isn't occupied, I'm plagued by my thoughts.

 I finished HS a year ago and have been rotting away in my room trying to figure out what I want to do for a career. I could not find something that allowed me to work whenever you want. Like completely dropping work until I decide I want to work again. I'm quite sure nothing offers finnancial freedom like that. The closest thing I have decided on is massage therapy cuz I like anatomy and sports medicine stuff, but it's not quite what I wanted.

The things on my bucket list sound like they would be nice to try, but not nice enough to where I HAVE to go and experience them. The same thing with my future, nothing sounds so exciting that it motivates me to try and work toward something everyday.


As for the reason I kinda feel like I shouldn't end it is because how fulfilling life can be. I know when people find their ""groove"", life is so rewarding and they can look forward to every single day. Even though I'm not at that point completely, some days when I talk with the few friends I have, or consume some media that I really have been looking forward to, I can truly calm down and enjoy that moment. 

Like I said before, there is someone who I respect and look up to (who passed away), and I feel like I would be wronging them, even though they have no clue who tf I am.

I haven't done it yet because I'm wating on some things to happen. However, I often think about the chances of my life improving, but I die too early to suicide.



I know suicide hurts everyone around the person who takes their own life, but I'm trying so very hard to make my own life bearable.

"I went on a trip to a city near mine to go on vacation since it's currently our school break here in my country. I was doing fine but then on the 5th day of my vacation, i was suddenly bothered because of what happened to me 5 months ago and starting that night, I keep thinking about the mistakes that i made in the past. There are constant negative thoughts in my head. I try to distract myself and avert my attention but it all comes back when im alone. When i do try to distract myself, there's still something in the back of my head reminding me of my mistakes.  
  
I have no idea what triggered these thoughts since i've been doing fine during all those months. I was fine at school back then. But now that we're on a break, many things have been bothering me. Specifically my past. I don't know what to do about it. I have talked to my bestfriend and girlfriend and i feel better that there's people that know what im going through, but it's been consuming me for days now and i think im going crazy. I zone out easily, i feel distracted, and i don't have the motivation to do anything at all.  
  
Am i going crazy? why is everything coming back now? why just now? why not back then? should i go see a psychiatrist? is this called rumination? anxiety? I seriously don't know what to do because this is my first time going through this.

I thought my depression days where behind me but it's all back , I've thought about ending my life but it would shock people around me and idk how to go about it

I tried talking to people, I'm completely undesirable on dating apps, I've tried meeting friends on other apps but Im just emotionally tired and it shows, it's sad that my ex can just get all the male attention she wants, and I don't have anyone to talk to

I would start with walking around your neighborhood on Sundays maybe twice or so and if anybody is out just practice saying 'hi' to them 'hey.  how's it going.' 'good you' 'I'm doing good thanks.' and build from there

 I also renewed my relationship with my sister and now she is my best friend and I am pretty good with her friends. I don't know if you have siblings, but I guess you can try with long lost friends if you don't have a one.

Maybe those things aren’t happening to me, but man there’s just so many possibilities in life and I think I changed my mind and wanna stay here to find out. 

It’s tough, it hurts like hell but it has to get better, next week i’m going to the movies alone for the first time in my life, maybe i’ll go to a bar during the week, awkward asf but definitely better than being home.

depression is a battle that we have to fight, and progress is like a roller coaster, ups and downs but forward.

I couldn’t function and live daily afraid of everything, esp. losing my job. I made mistakes too but the other person is just as horrible.

The only thing that has changed for me is that I have began taking desipramine (10 mg)  for GI issues for 2 weeks now. Oh, and I’m on my menstrual cycle. I do get more emotional during it but I don’t remember if I ever experienced anything like this.

I do go to weekly therapy and have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and moderate depression.

Sounds like dpdr. Don’t stress it as much as tht sounds easy but the more stress u add to it the more it stays. It usually goes away on its own. Just keep urself busy.

"I’ve had those since I was little but have never felt like this. I’m scared that it could be the antidepressant I’m taking for my GI issues but I’m really hoping it’s not bc that’s the only thing that’s helping me heal. 

I have inflammation of the esophagus, stomach and duodenum and my constant anxiety and stress is causing my stomach to produce a lot of acid which is making the inflammation worse. 

How do you deal with disassociation? I heard that Desipramine is good for it, so I’m hoping it can work on it as well even though it’s a super low dose.

My therapist said that disassociation is not a cause of concern if I’m able to continue my everyday task and if it doesn’t last too long. But it’s been a few days but I’m still able to function normally."	plastic_fre	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9987215399742126	no	strong	no	na	depression

"Been diagnosed with acute major depressive disorder since 2008

Been prescribed pretty much everything under the sun, but about 7 years ago I was prescribed lithium and it changed my life.

For nearly 8 years I was sporadically bedridden and unable to do much of anything. I could barely get to the bathroom and at one point I developed catatonia and muscle atrophy

I was hospitalized more than a dozen times, sometimes for over a month. I have had 15 ECT sessions and 14 different psychiatrists.

Then one day, a new doctor flippantly suggested I try lithium. I was desperate to try anything and to my surprise, I took the lithium and felt nothing for almost a week and a half.

As I went to bed that night disappointment was beginning to set in for yet another medication that didn't work. 

But the next morning I awoke to feeling like a million bucks! 

The air smelled alive and new, the bed felt comfy and warm, I actually jumped up and ran down to the kitchen because I actually *wanted* to eat something!

I bit into a plum and it was like the first time ever tasting fruit!

The transformation was absolutely incredible 

But I still struggle with other symptoms of depression, namely the psychomotor retardation and feeling ""awake""

In addition to lithium I take modafanil, I exercise, I eat right, but I still can't feel alert so I have to add vitamin B12 and coffee, and an energy drink just to feel alert

I wish there was something else because I hate the way caffeine makes me feel when I crash"	HappySkullsplitter	post	30.01508168034604	female	White	0.0017679021693766117	na	na	na	4	depression

"So yea i am a 32 male and life was rather fair until two months ago. I was happy in my relationship with a girl that was my friend for a long time, we where together for 4 years... Everything was well, we lived in my own apartment we did everything in the apartment, we got the flower and the dog hoping it will lead to the last phase... We owned a bar witch was her dream and for 3 years we worked hard to make it happen. All good ans well, until a confrontation happen between her and her friend and i was blamed for not taking her side, few days passed and she said we ""need a break"" i agreed eventualy hoping maybe some space would help her. Two days in the ""break"" i wake up and notice shes not at home... I decide to look at the cameras in the bar and i see they are turned off, i turn them on and look at the last recprding... I saw her making up with a random guy... I lost my shit, i never thought id reacha breaking point. In a month of discomfort, alcoholism, drug use, she decided that its over. I was willing to forgive this but... I dont know part of me wants to, the other part dose not. So i started self harming and self punishing, i tried many thing to end it, guess i dont have the balls for that too. Now im in a rutt, im trying not to drink as much as i can, i work two jobs to fill my mind, and its not working, im paying for a therapist because i was scared when i realized how far i go in the self harming... We live in the same city and we cant avoid each other alot. I know she feels terrible but today ahe decided to remove our photos so ( i would not be sad when a memory pops in Facebook ) so badicaly im struggling trying to make ends meet and pay my therapist, im trying to hide the cuts with bandeges trying to lie to people i just fell because i dont want her to feel bad for my mental breakdown. I guess my dog is the only thing keeping me barely together, even though he too struggles with the separation anxiety. And yes its an never ending loop of alcohol weed/drugs nightmares, night terrors, cutting, self blaming and self hating since i ""wasnt the man she thought i am"". I miss her every single day, i fight the urge to call her, i miss her family, they accepted me very well, so well that i felt the paranting love and support  that i didnt had. So now she got the bar that is falling appart, took the people i felt close to ( her family ) and i cant look them in the eyes. She still stalls taking her stuff from home and i still wait for her so i can take my keys.

"I cried infront of 42 people..
Today my English teacher made a session -a session in which she talked about depression.. ACC. To her depression a 15 year old teenager can't have depression.. she think what a 15 year old kid can overthink..
She asked the class - what is depression ( today I was not feeling well, I am having a seasonal depression) so I raised my hand and told her depression is when you think you don't worth anything you feel low , you friends make you believe you don't worth anything. No one tries to understand you.. with a heavy voice .. the whole class was impressed by my answer..she was also impressed by me. Then she said that asked the class who is depressed the most- everyone said my name..
She said my friends will tell my good qualities.. and my strength.. my friends told me my good qualities and strength.. I started crying immediately - because I worth a lot but still I can't understand myself... 
She asked the reason ; and because of me she told me  and the class about her struggle.. that life is tough but you have stand well.. then I also told her some of my points why I am like this ;
( she is soo funny ,but the funniest people are the mostly depressed) Charlie Chaplin was the most depressed person on this earth and he expressed all those things through his comedy, same applies to me and her).
My conversation with my teacher was emotional, I cried hard she cried also ...
You know the problem of us people is not that we can't express the problem is no one try to know us.. they think she is funny how can she be sad.. no sad part is in her life.. ..our friends poke us they taunt us they tell us we don't worth anything.. they say it without knowing that this affect us so much, they think they just said a joke but in real life that isn't just about joke... My voice is so beautiful, I believe it but many people told me that my voice is like crow and now I hate my voice - I want to sing but I don't.. i never tried to participate anymore thinking people will make fun of my voice we are not perfect.. I am beautiful - my friends once said that I am not beautiful, don't call yourself beautiful.. and now all the insecurity that was never ,now exist - I am beautiful,but my friends made me realise that I am not , now I am finding reason why my friends said it now I slowly started hating my nose, my skin texture.. someone said I am fat- I stopped eating for 2 months... Tell me who gave them this right to say about us this.. who gave them this rights????? Who are they to say something about us?? I am beautiful my voice is pretty - who are you judge and tell me that I am not?? Who are you and why you do this?? Do you know how it affects us.. do you have even a idea??? This isn't my fault this is their fault.. what my situation is because of them.. people say write you securities and burn it but tbh this never work, now daily I wake up and I see my insecurities and think that I will make changes in it.. but I can't.....

Hello. Idk if anyone would be able to read this but i really cant talk about how i feel to people in my life. I am 26 now. I was 18 when i started college with a dream of having a good group of friends.It never happened. Made one friend. She's there sometimes but never when i needed her.Got a job 3 years later. made a couple of friends but just in touch with one of them. we are good friends but she got married 2 months back and that's that.My sister was a constant support was my best friend. She left for college last year. Dated one guy 4 years back for 5-6 months but it ended(and for good). The last guy i was seeing for 8-9 months was my support system. But he could not commit so i had to break up. My schoolmates and colleagues are getting married, studying abroad and are living happy lives. Somehow nothing worked out for me. I kept losing people. Right now i am crying in washroom and it is hitting me.How terribly terribly alone i am and probably will be for life	throwawayoyyyyyyy	post	25.38727442928418	female	White	0.9982120990753174	na	na	na	5	depression

I tried everything I could, but nothing improved things. 
Now I'm 26 as well, finished with my master's - thought that would be another opportunity for a fresh start, but I got fired after four months on the job due to the effects of my mental health on my performance, and further job search has been a struggle since then.

"Im gonna be straight with you. That is an unhealthy coping mechanism that i am definitely guilty of indulging in. When i was in high school i remember one day i was so fucking hungry but i walked past the cafeteria and thought to myself “my fat ass doesnt deserve food” and when id feel my stomach grumble i got a weird masochistic kind of pleasure knowing i was hurting myself. I was convinced i was fat even when id say something about it and somebody would try to correct me.

It did make me happier with my body. I was mentally miserable and people would tell me they were worried about me being thin like that but i was a chubby kid growing up so i liked it. Its dangerous man look up eugenia cooney. You get the results you want but im willing to bet you are already experiencing body dysmorphia so losing a few pounds wont be enough. Really nothing will be enough and it just makes you feel weaker, its a cycle and it can get nasty.

Idk if it was from not eating or all the drugs i was doing but i ended up taking a dab in my friends car (something i did multiple times a day), turning whiteish/greenish and then passed out stepping into yhe parking lot and cracked my head open. Its just not healthy. It will make you thinner but it can be hard to know when to stop and could fuck you up long term.

"I’ve really been struggling lately. 

Struggling with taking care of myself, especially cleaning my apartment, brushing my teeth, exercising, eating right, etc. 

If I’m sitting there or laying down, I’ll think “I should really go for a walk”, but my brain is just like…I don’t want to. I just want to sit here and do nothing. Like my brain just absolutely hates the idea of doing anything that isn’t sitting and rotting. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m tired. I struggle to care about work. I struggle to care about myself, and I feel like an awful dog owner because I have no motivation to give my dog the life she deserves :( 

I’m constantly thinking about how at this rate, I’ll be dead in a few years just from eating and not exercising. I feel absolutely awful all the time. 

I know I’m just complaining but I really just don’t know what to do. 

I’ve been to therapy but I tend to intellectualize it too much and it just doesn’t feel helpful. Like nothing will help me. 

I’ve been on medication for years. Various SSRIs, but they’ve never really helped me with motivation. 

I’ve been on SNRIs but they always make me feel awful. Worse than normal. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I just want to be happy and healthy but I can’t find the will to put the work in no matter how much I try to talk myself into it. 

Has anyone felt like this? Has anything helped? :("	Skelly2007	post	24.293003074084787	female	White	0.9992223978042603	na	na	na	0	depression

"I have been obviously stressed yet secretly depressed for a while now. My partner knows it, but I'm not sure he knows how much worse it has gotten over these past few months. 

I haven't had a job in months (was sick & depressed) and when I was feeling a bit better,   no one would accept me. I barely have any savings left and it has been one of the reasons why I've been depressed. I feel pressured to make and save money asap because I know it's my partner's dream to live abroad and I also originally wanted to get away from the hell hole that is my country so I could finally be away from my toxic parents. 

Apart from that, I have a lot more reasons for my depression: manipulative and abusive parents, caring for my siblings who are far away from me (my 1 sibling is autistic), and just so much more that if I list them all down, I'll be writing a novel.

Anyways -- the title says it all. 

I am tired. I try to want to live these past few days but the noises in my head are just getting too much, I have been secretly crying almost everyday, Im anxious one of my parents will attempt to cause me harm, I have no job, I feel like I have no future, and I just feel so alone. 

I feel like I have no one to talk to, even with my partner. He listens and maybe I say too much, but I don't think he really understands since he often forgets what I say afterwards.

I just want to end it all but I don't want to bother anybody. I can't do it where I live (I live in my partner's family's other house) because when I'm gone, I dont want my partner to blame himself or for his family to be scared of the house or of me. I only have little savings so if I'm gone, I'm worried someone will be burdened with funeral arrangements and other expenses. 

I dont want anybody to feel sad or blame themselves, especially my partner and my siblings. I don't want to burden anybody, but I just need to be gone. How can I do this without bothering anyone? 

I'm sincerely asking, thank you."	cupified	post	13.757497714660275	female	White	0.9953782558441162	na	na	na	10	depression

"Hey, you’re a very courageous person and I hope you know it
You keep living those things and you come here to talk about it because you’re worried that it would be “too much” for your entourage (and more particularly your boyfriend)… however the real person who takes “too much” (of pressure, thoughts, deceptions etc..) it’s you. I’ll try to be honest and realistic
The fact that you want to disappear without “bothering anybody” shows that you’re probably an incredible human who is concerned about the people around you, and at the same time a “terrible” person for yourself because you “should be more concerned” with the fact that you actually feel the need to disappear… DO NOT DOWNPLAY YOUR CONCERNS, YOUR MIND, YOUR NEEDS
You’re having a tough time right now, so try to be compassionate with you, your thoughts, feelings and emotions, even if those around doesn’t really get it all the time, accept that this time is hard to manage and that you are vulnerable and weak, find your own way to be more stable, accept any of your thoughts and try to find what you would answer if for example it was your boyfriend who were telling you this, or a friend, anybody you love… imagine if someone you love would tell you : I want to disappear, try to imagine your answer and give it to yourself, treat yourself as something you have to take care in this really difficult period

Been on antidepressants on and off since 90’s, anti anxiety drugs, therapy, still just a loser. Bullied, by kids and teachers, useless narcissistic parents. Built a new persona as a party guy as a sr in high school, rode out the next 12 years in a fog. Just a collection of defenses masquerading as a person.  Tried tried tried for so very long. Can’t bear to be in touch with any old friends as the gap is too large and their success makes me acutely aware of my failure. Can’t even commit suicide because I have kids, so I just have to suffer every day until I die opening the door at Walmart. Worse, so many people over my life have told me I’m the smartest person they ever met. They are all obv. wrong, but it makes me feel even worse.  I’ve never gotten how to be a real person like everyone else or how to do well.  Just trapped in suffering til death.

It sounds like you went through quite a bit when you were younger, and that you didn’t have advantages that your peers might’ve had. But you are still here every day and remain here for your kids, even though you feel like you are a failure. I would argue that you’re strong for this, and are a great representation of what it means to being there for your kids. I personally don’t think that’s what a failure is at all.

For the past couple months i’ve felt like I’m stuck in this never ending loop of sadness and the same ritual everyday. I work at an awful job where I don’t feel valued or respected, I wake up everyday at 1pm because I can’t seem to fall asleep almost every night. The only reason I haven’t quit my job is because my anxiety about telling my boss  is so bad it’s been months sense i’ve made my decision but still haven’t actually told my boss because i’m just to nervous.I feel like I wake up just to go to work, just to stay up and go on tiktok and do absolutely nothing with myself, just to struggle every night for 2+ hours to calm my brain down to go to sleep. Im still young and live with my parents, but feel like I never see them anymore because of my habits, which makes me extremely upset. I also am one of the only people in my town who didn’t go away for college and i’m feeling very behind and idiotic. To add onto this I very recently just got out of a dead end relationship with a guy who couldn’t care less that it’s over. I genuinely feel like I have no purpose in life and like i’ll be stuck in this endless loop for my entire life, I feel like for my entire life I’ll be living with my parents because of my separation anxiety, or i’ll be stuck in this same ritual when all i crave is change. I don’t know where to start, I don’t know what to do to change any of this. Everything about my life seems such like a dead end like there’s nothing left for me here.

"Sorry to hear what you're going through. From everything you've said, it certainly sounds like you're stuck; wanting to enact various changes in your life, including quitting your job, but struggling to do it, the relationship you had, etc.

From my personal experience w/ anxiety, what's helped me deal with it is distracting my mind by making it focus on something else. Giving what you want to do (quit your job), it might be a bit difficult to go through it w/ usual means; what worked for me when I was in social situations that made me anxious is imagining a fictional character standing nearby, acting in absurd ways, and having my mind focus on it. Some variation of it (or even listening to music on one ear if you have wireless earbuds, that'll get you in the right mood & being able to focus on it while you engage w/ your boss) could work for you, especially if you test it out beforehand.

There are also ways to address sleeping issues, but it depends on what the cause is, whether it's meds, or in my case, imagining fictional stories/scenarios I feel engrossed in & am a part of, but not enough that'd keep me awake. Usually, I fall asleep within ~10 minutes w/ it, and I've often struggled w/ sleep.

As for the rest, well, as much it may suck it's not your fault that the person you were w/ seemingly didn't care about the breakup w/ you. Some people, especially nowadays, can be like that. I'm sure there are other people out there who'd be more than happy to be w/ you and around you, so don't give up on it or let it get you down.

In regards to general change, especially since you're saying you struggle w/ not knowing where to start, a good way to start may be writing down things you want to change in your life, and taking your time to change one thing at a time. It might be easier to do it when you have it all laid out.

Hope that helps."	ConversationShot1942	reply	na	na	na	0.9993414282798767	strong	strong	strong	na	depression
"Olive oil appears to be affecting my mood in a positive way.  I know that sounds weird... and yeah maybe its just a coincidence.  But that's the only change I've made and my mood has improved.

I often don't have time to eat when I'm hungry, so my stomach makes these embarrassing noises.  In order to stop the noises (and my hunger).  One day I decided I would just take a quick swig of extra-virgin olive oil to stop the noises.  It worked.  It also helped to stave off my hunger for a little longer until I had time to eat something proper.  I meant to to only do it that one day, but I kept forgetting to take the bottle home so it was at my desk for a week... I ended up taking between 1-3 swigs a day straight from the bottle depending on my eating schedule that day, for the entire week.  By the end of the week I was also in a much better mood in general.  So I just kept doing it over the course of a couple of months.

Interestingly enough- I've also ended up losing a little bit of belly fat too even though I'm not exercising or doing anything else different.  After I experienced my difference in mood, I looked up depression rates in countries that have high olive oil consumption and they're significantly lower there... but obviously there could be a million other reasons for that too.

Anyway-  Just thought I'd share this in case anyone else may want to try it.  After all, EVOO is relatively cheap, safe, healthy for the body and it tastes good to boot, so why not?  Worst that could happen is that it doesn't work."	RevealRemarkable4836	post	20.371652810916736	female	White	0.0011977278627455235	na	na	na	2	depression

The pain never ends, It only gets worse pulling you further into darkness. Pointless trying to talk about it to someone because they will just end up disappointing you with there reaction and response. Words are Pointless, they only make you feel better about yourself for that moment. Trying to compress you're pain or change the way you mentally feel about yourself is useless. since I was 12 years old I've been dealing with depression and these intrusive thoughts everyday of my life. Every year I'm losing strength to continue fighting my demons. everyday in my life  I'm constantly contemplating suicide wether it be today, tomorrow, few days from now I know my time is coming. My head is constantly full of dark thoughts all day that sometimes scares me. I've tried to overdose a few times but couldn't muster up the courage to take the full bottle instead end up taking half and feeling sick for a day or two. so now that I have a gun it shouldn't be thought process, just simply pulled the trigger. I've been searching up ways online for days how to instantly killed myself with a shot to the head. Life just feel so Pointless to me, I really can't explain it enough how i just can't seem to find an inch of motivation to continue living. I've just been constantly thinking to myself these pass days will I make it to my next birthday cause I'm really struggling with wanting to continue to live right now more than ever in my life. As a kid I thought life would get much better than this I guess I was wrong again like always, I'm such a failure."	NoCalligrapher6253	reply	na	na	na	0.9991826415061951	no	no	no	na	depression
I wish someone who really loves me, could hold me rn. But no one does. I haven’t eaten a single meal in a week, nobody even noticed. I could die, I could live and it doesn’t make a fucking difference to anyone. I almost cannot breathe because of how sad I am. I’ve just lost all will to go on. I’m hurting.

"yeah. it sucks. i’m a suicidal mess of a human.

we started dating and he got the impression that i’m a normal fucking person. a few months in, after he had already fallen quite a bit for me, i let him know. about my attempts, my history, how i feel about life, and how i inevitably plan to end my life. some day. some how. no real definitive plan but it’s definitely in the books for me.

to be fair it started out very casual and neither of us had serious intentions. but we both liked each other a lot more than we expected to. i didn’t think i needed to let someone i was casually dating know about my mental health. but somehow it turned into more than casual. 

but now it’s ruining us. he wants someone to build a future with, which is understandable. not necessarily marriage or kids. but 10 years down the line he wants to be in a secure relationship with a partner. 10 years down the line i wanna be dead. lol. 

and it’s not like i’m NOT getting help. i’m in three types of therapy. TMS, EMDR, and CBT. i’ve tried at least 7 different medications. none have worked or have given me horrible side effects. 

but i still don’t feel differently about life. i’ve always preferred to be dead. i haven’t attempted again bc i’m actually thinking about my loved ones. waiting for the right time. i think the right time would be when my dog dies, which is in 7-10 years. don’t think i could do life without her. i’ve spent half my life wanting to die, it seems unlikely to change now, as much as i want it to.

living past the next ten years seems horrifying.

but he and i, we care about each other so much. but he’s never understood. never understood being suicidal. it’s hard for him to wrap his mind around. and because of my mental health, we’ve been scared to put labels on anything. so we’ve done all the relationship type stuff. just haven’t called it one. so lots of miscommunication. he didn’t know if he should keep his options open. he thought i was keeping my options open. 

but he can’t just wait around for me to die. he needs to move on. but neither of us want to move on. it’s hard. don’t know what to do. thanks for reading if you got this far"	buckyspunisher	post	33.64080446722254	female	White	0.9974493384361267	na	na	na	1	depression
"Take it slow. Enjoy the days. Acquire a soulmate. You didn’t expect to be talking about mental health with him, so, you never know what other good can mysteriously appear from between you two. Companionship is fun. It lasts forever too.

I had this girlfriend, she used to be all over me. She was a perfect Angel of a human being and she was beautiful like a Victoria Secret angel. She graduated from Princeton, got into Harvard, was an Olympian. I loved her a lot! She died at age 29; I was 28. The news said she died of mental health complications, some say suicide.

But even after her death, I look at her photos and I be trying to make them speak to me, ear hustling. Once, sort of recently, I was praying to her and she encouraged me to play the lottery. Four days later I won’t the most I’ve ever won. I hear her voice sometimes but she doesn’t say much because she’s in a state of dying. But I remember her saying “Remember me” clearly.

You should cherish you boy friend, make memories, he may be your medication that works. Love conquers all. If I would have knew that Kamara was suicidal, I would still be there for her as much as I could for as long as I could because she was that cool and interesting and beautiful!

Tbh I hate hugs so I can’t relate to this, I have this weird phobia about people's hygiene no matter who it is. So that's why I don't like hugs, but I do wish I had a serious friend talk to about serious problems. Therapy is an option, but I feel like therapists don’t actually care about your problems since they see multiple patients every time they do their job and it will just feel like you’re speaking to a monotone robot/A.I. Reddit overrates the hell out of therapy I think, I do have only one best friend, but she’s never serious about anything super deep.

So I live in a very shitty place and I've always resented this place. I've always wanted to move out as soon as possible but I was too young and I had no source of income. I lost my dad 2 years ago and now I'm 20 and have 5 siblings and a mom who completely depend on my financially. However I feel traumatized everyday because this place is really f\*cked up and my life still feel as miserable as it was.  I'm doing very good at my career and I can move out and live stably alone whenever I want but the family responsibility is just killing me inside. So I feel very stuck and it's depressing. Any insight would be appropriated. I really want to live my own life. 	Artistic-Travel-9049	post	18.501578948892988	female	White	0.999103307723999	na	na	na	2	depression

But at the end of the day, this is something your mother needs to figure out.  If anything, you kinda help her out by not depending on her.

We haven’t spoke in 3 months and it still hurts how one day they decided they didn’t want me in their life anymore. I get depression affects how you think and they seemed to be dealing with a lot but it still hurts that they made the conscious choice to just end things when they used to seem like they acc liked me but maybe that was just a facade idk. I really tried to be there for them but they didn’t want my help which is fair enough but now I’m stuck missing someone who wants nothing to do with me- they severed all ties any connection and it makes me feel like an idiot for caring so much about someone who doesn’t want to even be reminded I exist. And then it makes me feel worse for feeling bad when they did it because they were depressed because if I feel bad that makes me insensitive and ignorant by ignoring the fact they were depressed so they had a fair reason but it makes me so sad even now.

I know AA in the UK isn’t allied with any group, it’s just there for mutual support, prayer is not encouraged. I guess that’s not true everywhere. There are however therapists who advertise their ability to support those with addiction issues (at least in the UK).

My little brother killed himself in April 2022 and then my dad killed himself in February 2023. There were times in my life where my dad was the best friend I had in the whole world. He didn’t leave a letter or anything though. Not even a goodbye text. So I must not have been inspiring enough as a daughter to have earned a goodbye. About a month later the person I loved kicked me out of their life. I used to be relatively happy and generous towards other people. Now I don’t trust anyone. I’m so angry and sad I understand why no one would want to be with me. And I don’t want anyone anyway. It’s like all the color is gone from the world and that’s ok. I almost like the cold grayness now. But I think of the person I used to be sometimes and I do miss being her. I don’t know that I’ll ever get back to that version of myself though.

"I cannot tell if I'm depressed. I've been depressed for a few years now, I've had meds, therapy and a change in mindset, and it helped until my therapist and meds were rejected so to speak, because of irrelevant personal life issues. Anyways, I cannot tell if I'm depressed cause I don't feel sad, I don't feel happy, I feel nothing. I'm always bored, I'm always tired, and I'm always at a razor thin fuse. I'm talking I'll get angry at someone for proving me I'm wrong, being wrong doesn't make me angry though. Being persistent while I'm adamant I'm right makes me angrier, cause I'm 100% sure I'm right and then I'm not. Then that makes me more tired cause I have to continuously explain why I'm right. Then that makes me angrier cause I'm tired and bored.

I'll be honest too, the two things that seem to make me the saddest rn are just wanting someone to love me and acknowledge me, and also being insulted by my friends.

"I (21f) have thought that I’d be dead by 25 for a long time. I’m not sure when it started but It’s just something I’ve always known. I don’t know how I will die, maybe illness, accident, suicide, who knows. Anything is on the table. I have never been truly suicidal, but I have thought about death more then the average person I’m sure. I am not afraid of death and would have no problem taking my own life, there is not anything in my life that I am overly attached to, but I know that my mother would be devastated. My mother is a very emotional person, one of those “is it my fault?” Kinda parents. Like yes, it’s your fault that I’m naturally shy and introverted.

Side note: why do all extroverts think that being an introvert is a death sentence. Maybe I don’t have a million friends and prefer to stay home, that doesn’t make my life worth any less then yours. 

Anyways, my mother would take my death so hard that I don’t see her being able to function as a human being after my death (she would be like that if my dad or brother were to die too I’m sure). I don’t want her life to end, just mine. I want her to live her life to the fullest and enjoy every moment of it, but she wouldn’t be able to if I died. If I do kill my self it will be quick. None of this slitting my wrists until I bleed out shit, that sounds painful. I’ve thought about taking all of my pills because I get a 3 months supply at a time, I know that pills will more often damage your liver then kill you, but 3 months worth? That would do the job I think. The pills would probably hurt too though. I’m Canadian so we don’t have any guns in the house… I’d have to think about it some more, closer to. I won’t live to see 25 but I’m not going to die right now. Probably when I’m 23-24 if I had to guess. I’ve been writing a suicide note for a few years now. It’s almost 19 pages long. Just in case that is the way I go. I kinda hope I get sick though. It would take the responsibility off of my hands but I would still know it was happening before hand. If I am in an accident I won’t know I’m going to die until it’s done. I don’t believe in god. I consider myself agnostic. I have no proof that any religious concepts are real, but there also isn’t enough proof to prove that they are not real. Whose to say? And how do you decide that one religion is correct over the others? Which is right and which is wrong? I would like to know. If I died I would know what came next, even if it is nothing and I never learn because I cease to exist, it’s not like I could regret it. For anyone wondering at this point, I was diagnosed with depression a few years ago but my mom thinks I have been depressed since I was a kid and I trust her judgment more then any dr because my grandmother is depressed and my mother was her caretaker for years. I don’t know if I have ever been happy. I don’t have any friends, have never even been kissed, I’m not in school nor do I have any dreams in life. I don’t know. I just don’t know. 

Telling myself that I will die by 25 is a relief. I only have to hold on a few years longer and then it will all be over."	Jelliap	post	22.450512649666845	male	White	0.014149932190775871	na	na	na	0	depression

When I graduated high school covid hit and so I never had a chance to learn how to make friends and to this day I still struggle to learn how too, because of all of this it's like I'm incapable of having relationships. It feels impossible to me. I've tried so many times but something always goes wrong and either I or they drift away. 

I'm OCD and Bipolar. I go to therapy and take antidepressants, adhd meds, and mood stabilizers but nothing seems to work to stop all of my ruminations and fears from coming back up. I can't motivate myself to do anything. I'm gaining weight rapidly and am disgusted by my own body. I'm completely broke and have no friends. I'm worthless and have nowhere to go. 

One of the few times managed to meet another queer person that person ended up turning on me at my previous job killing my ability to trust others in the future. It's like everything is working to tear me down and I have nobody to turn to. I'm completely losing my mind in ruminations and fears. These ruminations border on suicidal thoughts even thought I know I don't want to die it's like there unstoppable.
I'm stuck at a dead end job. I'm not in school anymore after dropping out thanks to mental health. I'm at work now hiding away posting this just to empty my thoughts out and reflect on them 

Adult life is so alien to me I have no idea what i'm doing and so far no matter how hard I try I just seem to crash and burn. I try my best in life in every nuance I steer away from all potentially abusive substances. I try my best to be as kind and giving as possible to everybody around me but yet none of it is fulfilling enough to make this feeling go away. At this point I just don't know what to do"	ManicMaeve	post	25.182438556124445	female	White	0.9985237717628479	na	na	na	1	depression

im 17 about to go into my senior year of hs. been struggling a lot w depression, anxiety, low self esteem, etc. lately its been really bad; i've felt super alone, having lost all my friends from earlier years of hs. i'm also a huge pothead and have been for the past 2 years. it's to the point where its all i really know; any social situation i get into is always centered around weed, my closest remaining friendships as well. it has made all my relationships feel superficial. quitting would be a huge challenge for me, as not only am i pretty dependent on it, but also everyone i know is a stoner and it would involve possibly losing my only remaining friends. i still feel like it might be the only chance i have at getting better, being happier or whatever. any tips, support or insight greatly appreciated	Buck64209	post	16.685184093196064	male	White	0.9936218857765198	na	na	na	7	depression
I was in that same exact position, and yes, quitting does help. Of course it was hard to quit, but seeing how the clarity of my thoughts and thinking improved made everything worth it. I also depended on weed bc of my anxiety and depression, but I also noticed that smoking increased my pointless overthinking of life. It made me more anxious and it didn't seem relaxing anymore after sometime. You got this :)	Buck64209	reply	na	na	na	0.9936218857765198	no	strong	no	na	depression
You have to master weed smoking. Know why you smoke, know how to smoke, roll perfect blunts, smoke responsibly, etc. As long as you know what you’re doing it shouldn’t hurt. After quitting I find myself ‘sneaking’ to smoke. I only quit because others won’t mind their business.	Buck64209	reply	na	na	na	0.9936218857765198	no	strong	no	na	depression

I don't notice any effect on my depression with or without.  The longest I have gone without hemp or cannabis is a few months.  It didn't feel worth not doing since it helps my anxiety and mood.

Can second this. Smoked weed from the ages of 13 to 30, habitually (multiple times a day, every day) haven't smoked since may if this year and have felt levels better than I ever was before.

I have been doing okay for like 2-3 months and simply put I’m just not feeling well mentally. Again. With no legitimate reason in sight I’m sinking, again. This weekend I could feel it that I wasn’t doing great and now I’m laying in bed just ruminating on why this is happening. I have to assume it is partially because I started talking to this girl recently after being single (and enjoying it, for the most part) and not talking to anyone for about a year and it’s hard to read her and I’m sensitive, unfortunately, and I overthink really bad and it’s never positive. I’m irritated at myself because I’m at this point right now but I’m also angry at having to be human and have emotions. Yeah life isn’t horrible, but the constant involuntary roller coaster I have to deal with in my head.. I would rather be numb. But then again, there isn’t a feeling out there like love.. But the background noise that comes with it destroys me.. Idk. Just struggling a little bit right now.	iJaybe94	post	10.156899711114203	male	White	0.9992021918296814	na	na	na	1	depression

I know that there are many people who will say that they know how you feel, but you are the only person who has been in your own shoes and has been through the things you have been through.

I have done grade 12 this year and my college doesn’t start till January of 2024. Till then I’m just free. All my other peers are doing something or the other, some have already started college, and some are taking professional courses for a part time job. I am just free. I’m on my phone all day, watching shows, reels. I don’t do anything. I have hobbies , but don’t feel like doing anything. I have found professional courses , but i just don’t do them. I am privileged to have this time, but I’m just wasting this. I can’t simply get myself to do shit. I just lack effort. I was a hardworking person who knew what to do. I feel lost. I don’t really have any good friends either. My boyfriend is opposite, he goes to university, studies additional courses, has inter-ships. He does it all. He doesn’t really give me time, as he is busy, which is understandable. He calls me jobless(i can’t do any jobs its a small town) , and free, which i am. My family keeps on taunting me, they’re right as well. I just don’t know why am i like this. I know I should do something but i am not. I feel like shit. I feel worthless. I add nothing to my life, nothing to other’s life. I just exist. I want to end me. I have tried everything at this point. I just am a looser. I hate myself.

"Hey, congratulations on finishing high school and getting into college! There’s nothing wrong with taking a break before starting college, but it sounds like doing relatively little while the people around you are doing extra is taking a toll on your mental health. 

One suggestion I have is to start looking more into the field/subject you are majoring in, or if you are undecided look into possible majors you like. I definitely wish I researched my major more before starting college (although I ended up loving it anyways). Look for online courses, YouTube videos, if you know what classes you are taking you can look up the syllabus and start researching. Find what sub-topics interest you, and even look for work/projects you could do (this highly depends on the field, for example I’m in CS so I would spend time programming, maybe building a portfolio of little projects). Hopefully this way you can spend some more of your time being productive and getting ready to hit the ground running once you start college, good luck, you got this!"

I get that, I will put things off if I don’t stop myself. What I like to do is just set small goals for myself, like tomorrow I will choose an online class (even if I don’t find the perfect one) and enroll. And I just tell myself that I’ll do that tomorrow no matter what, even if I do nothing else productive.  And that’s ok, cause the point is to get the ball rolling and just try to spend a little time everyday until you are used to it. If I think about everything I need to get done, I won’t feel like it, so I focus more on getting X amount done in a day and don’t worry about the rest yet.

"Suicidal ideation (thoughts, fantasies) without intent or desire is actually pretty common.

> What does this accomplish? 

There can be a number of different things, but often in these cases it's helpful to try looking at the ideation and imagery symbolically.  Our brains talk to us in metaphors all the time, but most of us in the reddit demographics come from cultures that (imnsho) are literal-minded to the point of sickness, so we don't get the message from within.  

These kinds of thoughts can symbolize different things the most common general idea, in my experience, is the self-inflicted ""death"" of some part of our identity.  I.e. it usually means that we're dealing with a [false self](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A02Ucd6monY), or that we're not living in a way that's true our actual personal values.

"What worked for me was to break it down into smaller tasks and complete one task a day. I was also able to ask for help when I needed but understand that may not be possible.

I started with things that could be a health risk like old food, trash, and dishes. Whenever I left my room I'd take one item or a pile out. 

Break it down as much as you need to for that task to feel doable; 

Day one: Pick up and put in a trash bag the trash from x corner of the room.

Day two: do another corner.

As in, it doesn't have to be neatly folded and kept inside a shelf. But anywhere that's not on my bed or my floor will do. So if that's a chair, it goes onto the chair. 

Do this with one object at a time until you're bed is somewhat clear. Doesn't have to be perfect damn doesn't even have to be good. As long as you have space to sleep that's good enough.

I’m glad you found somebody like that, they sound incredible. I currently don’t really have anyone like that, but I may try to speak to my dad about it. I’ve considered it before, and it’s quite hard for me. I mean, he grew up in two heavily abusive homes with both his mom and his dad. Not only is he still here and successful, but he still talks to his parents. I have a great household with him, but I had to leave my mom because she was pretty emotionally abusive and manipulative to me. That’s nothing compared to what he’s went through. I don’t know, im just incredibly confused. I hate myself, my life, and just about everything except for a select few things. I wish I just had an off switch, so that when I wasn’t around my dad and family, and anyone else I have to put on a happy face for, I could just stop feeling, and go into a deep sleep until I had to leave it again. I would never end my life, only because I couldn’t do that to my father. However, I just see myself nowhere in life. I don’t see myself working a successful career, or having a partner, or leaving the heavily bigoted town that my dad as a man with liberal and progressive ideals somehow found himself in, or just feeling content for more than mere moments.

I've had bouts of depression starting at 16 years old. I'm 19 now and I'm still struggling with it. I've been going to therapy and really working at my trauma and self esteem issues, but it keeps popping up. This whole summer I've been keeping myself busy every single day to try and distract myself from the bad thoughts. It tends to build up over time and it's all blowing up right now and I feel absolutely terrible. It felt like I was finally starting to heal a little bit from all the pain I've had in my life and while I know that healing isn't linear, this feels like a really big step back. There are so many things that I wish were different about my life. I try so hard to stay positive, but sometimes it gets the best of me. My family has no idea how to act around me when I'm feeling this way which makes me feel even more helpless. They are very much against antidepressants, so I know if I try to go on one, they will be really disappointed in me. I guess I'm just posting this because I don't have any close friends in my life at the moment and it always makes me feel more terrible when I talk to my family about this topic.

"I moved into my dorm yesterday for welcome week and I cant seem to hold onto friends. I cant hold a conversation for more then maybe a minute, and thats with my roommate. I feel alone even when im out in public, I feel like no one wants me and no one cares but my family. ive already cried once. my backup career would be to fly planes commercially, but the faa doesnt let depressed pilots fly commercially.  so I have to choose between seeking help which would burn my only backup plan or be miserable. ive met people on my hall but havent been able to make a single connection let alone freindship.

my mom started a college fund for me when I was first born and because she picked good stocks it has enough to supply 4 years of college and more. she has money saved for retirement but not enough. my college fund would help alot. I dont see the point of living if I cant share it with anyone. ive felt miserable for a while now and have contemplated writing a suicide note. 

my mom is leaving tommorow morning. I dont know if its just being homesick or a loser or depression.

ive heard cnu is a friendly school but I cant seem to get anywhere with anyone. those who have been in my shoes before, does it ever get better?

You are paying a health care fee at your university and part of the is mental health services. They deal with young people in crisis and struggling with these types of issues all the time.

"I feel lonely often. I could be outside in a crowd of people, I could be talking or playing with friends but I still feel lonely. Sometimes I talk to this person who I always felt like made things better, and he did. He does. Yet nowadays it's very difficult to hold on to that good feeling. Nowadays loneliness has taken precedent over everything else. I can't focus at work, I can't focus on what my therapist is talking me through, I can't get a grip.

I'm incredibly lonely in a world with people who are there for me. And if that isn't enough, will anything ever be enough? All I can do is cry and try not to drown in the thoughts and feelings that push me to a downward spiral.

Loneliness makes my chest feel so heavy. It makes life seem impossible to get through."	attetreen	post	17.1699983911111	male	White	0.9980612397193909	na	na	na	1	depression
Dont give up. Ive been alone for years now. It sucks. But you have to keep fighting. Each day may be rough. Each day may get worse but continue to fight. Its not over man. Everyone i love abandoned me for no reason. I teach and coach and give my all everyday to make sure these kids are great but I am not. Im surrounded by people but so alone inside.

"It seems like a common theme that people will mention that they ""used to"" take an SSRI and then it stopped working, and they either tried others and one worked, and then that eventually stopped working too, and they then went with therapy and lifestyle improvements like exercise and have treated their mental health problems without an SSRI for X years.

This is quite annoying and makes me want to not bother trying one if I know it's just going to stop working out of nowhere one day. It makes it seem like SSRIs are just a short-term crutch to get you to fix your life before they stop working or have bad side effects, basically."

"This is going to be very long so thank you in advance for reading.

For some context: 

I (26F) was accepted into one of the top schools for the industry I want to work in. It has some serious clout name wise and offers an extensive alumni network that gives students a leg up in job hunting. Recruiters often headhunt talent from this program. I was really shocked I managed to get in because I was banking all my hopes on this. I was going to forget my dreams and just go back to school for something socially stable. Things were fine first semester. I was motivated to prove myself and excited to learn. Then in the second semester, I burned out. I put a lot of pressure on myself to receive perfect grades and constantly worried about my limited time in the program because it's only two years. I had invested my savings into moving to a new state, into the tuition, and my self-worth into the program. I was able to win some financial aid through merit scholarships but that also meant I had to keep my GPA at a certain level. I had given myself additional pressure/internal criticism from my strict tiger mom who never really believed I could make a career out of my dreams. I wasn't eating and sleeping. I'd drink copious amounts of energy drinks to stay awake. I tunnel-visioned into my assignments and withdrew socially. I self-destructed so badly to the point of attempting suicide. I've had suicidal ideation moments in undergrad from general academic pressure but this was on another level. I was involuntarily committed to in-patient care for about a week and a half.  

I got out on my birthday and received psychiatric treatment and therapy through the university. I ended up getting diagnosed with depression and general anxiety. The treatment plan and support from the school's health system helped bring me back to baseline. I'm currently on 3 different antidepressants. In the remaining half of second semester however I was still struggling. I had episodes a number of times to vary degrees of severity. It was almost like the floodgates were open. The side effects from getting used to the medication would negatively impact my productivity. Opening up to a therapist for the first time ever, had me emotionally drained on a day-to-day basis. I cried more easily now over trivial things when before I rarely got emotional about anything. People kept asking if I was okay or if I was doing better and I would just lie and say I was fine because it seemed like that was the only acceptable answer. 

Current time: 

I had fallen behind on four assignments for 2nd semester and was given summer extensions to complete them. I went back home because I managed to land an internship at a big company and additional career training through a DEI program. I had also won a scholarship for the next semester. Things seemed okay tho I had some concerns I was going to relapse badly again because I didn't have access to my university therapist and psychologist while I was back in my home state. My insurance did a horrible job connecting me to mental health services and I lowered it on my list of priorities to just focus on work. And like clockwork I began to spiral again towards the end of the internship and the DEI program when responsibilities and duties began to pile up. I got a disappointing review from my supervisor and let down my partner on a final project. I would wake up depressed and numb even while taking my meds on schedule. I constantly felt extreme guilt and felt like I was asking for too much when I took mental health days off. I managed to get two of my assignments done however refrained from communicating with my professors out of shame and anxiety. My perfectionism wouldn't let me email them until every assignment was finished and polished. I ended up missing the final deadline for the extensions but thought now that I didn't have any work responsibilities I could spend the rest of the week before classes officially started again to finish the last two. Instead, I suddenly got a email from the program kicking me out. I was calm initially and called the program head for more information but it went straight to voicemail. 

I had a suicidal meltdown for 5 hours in the bathroom and got involuntarily submitted again to far a worse inner city psych ward that was underfunded and poorly staffed. I was threatened to get forcibly injected for not wanting to wear the patient scrubs. The psychologist barley had time for me. I only stayed overnight and lied to get discharged immediately. I began the appeal process for my grades and learned it would take over two months to even schedule a hearing. This means I won't graduate on time, would have to take a year long break even if I won the appeal, and I would lose the connections I had made with my current cohort. I've been doing all I can with the support of the associate dean for student affairs but I've been spending my time in a depressed haze.   

I don't know what to do. I don't know how I'm going to tell my mom I was kicked out. I had these great opportunities and just sabotaged them.          "	cc444444	post	21.384339912183165	female	White	0.9960547685623169	na	na	na	3	depression
"They did not kick you out because you were depressed, you are mentally ill and sadly didn't not communicate to your professors as you Indicated, missed the extensions and got kicked out.

I understand how you might spiral from that, but you really needed to wait a bit to get a reply, it went to voicemail, not everyone's on their phone all the time, but I know you were stressed, mentally ill and out of your mind.

I studied physics for a year but missed most of my lecturers, assignment and everything, didn't even take the final exams cause I knew I could pass them.

"I’m so sorry that this happened to you. 
Don’t blame yourself, multiple people and institutions failed you several times along the way. You can recover and get back on track if given time and help, don’t lose hope. 

The fact alone that you were accepted and did the first year of this program shows that you can make it very far in your field and that you are capable!

Try to keep open perspective on your situation and abilities to limit it getting clouded by this traumatic experience:

The opportunity to continue in your field isn’t lost and you can get where you want to be with time. You can follow a different path and make new connections you wouldn’t have made otherwise. 

I understand the guilt associated with receiving a sought-after education and having many opportunities but failing to thrive. I sympathize with not finding comfort at home because of certain expectations. 

I’m trying to provide any comfort by saying that though a lot of pressure is put on us to be perfect, there is an option not to subject ourselves to it. You can stop it from taking over your life, without letting your ambition die. 

Easier said than done, for sure, but not impossible. 

However, priorities: 
You can’t reach goals if you’re health is neglected. 
‘The best choice’ maybe isn’t your best choice and don’t punish yourself over a missed opportunity. Those are unavoidable in life. 

Try to solve the situation with your program. Try to get medical professionals to attest to your state of being. But do not lose hope if it doesn’t work out. 

A year’s delay doesn’t mean you won’t accomplish your dream: Especially if it means you have time to take care of yourself so you can keep going."	cc444444	reply	na	na	na	0.9960547685623169	strong	no	no	na	depression

I’ve tried meditating, writing in a journal, being out in nature, everything that people say you should do, but it doesn’t work for me. I’m fairly tall and good looking but have always struggled with confidence and self esteem, I don’t view myself better than anyone else.

"Long story short about 8 years ago I have had an ear infection and took 2 tablets of paracetamol and eardrops prescribed by a doctor. I really wanted to relax before bed so I smoked a good joint and though I will fall asleep soon. Unfortunately what happened next is still a mystery to me. 
Suddenly I started to hear voices in my head telling me they are aliens contacting me through telepathy. I really felt like someone have taken control over my body and I couldn't resist what was happening (Psychotic episode?) I listened to them and what they said and ran to the nearby lake where the portal opened (delusion?) and I jumped into the river. I let my body sink and drown. I took deep breaths in underwater and my senses have disappeared. I have no idea for how long I was there but I woke up and understood that I'm still there and have to swim out. It felt like I rised from the dead. (Lucky?)
I then had a lot of visions, like past lives etc (was I hallucinating?) and a voice telling me about my missions in this life etc.
I believed in all of this for a long time until I started thinking what really happened is that I attempted suicide without realising it.
Is it even possible?
I still can't understand what happened.
Was it marijuanna effect on me mixed with paracetamol that just fucked up my brain? I was depressed at the time but I never really wanted to die. I had suicidal thoughts but never planned to attempt suicide.

Marijuana has shown to be a catalyst for psychosis, and prolonged use can lead to chronic psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. I’m not sure if using it at the same time as paracetamol was what caused the reaction. I would stay away from marijuana from now on if I were you. Schizophrenia can be a terrorizing chronic illness that has every potential to take your life and just destroy it.

"> my question is is it possible to attempt suicide during psychosis not knowing that you actually are about to kill yourself?  

There's no answer to this question because there's no hard line between what is and isn't a suicide attempt.  

I will say that when we're in some kind of altered state, including psychosis, the line between the literal and metaphorical becomes blurred, so even if there *were* an answer to that question, metaphorical suicidal thought means something completely different from literal suicidal thought, so there are probably better ways to look at the whole situation."	oxygen-heart	reply	na	na	na	0.03563765063881874	no	no	strong	na	depression

"My whole fucking life has been a bunch of No's.   
Couldn't really do much with friends unless it was in the neighborhood or at school. No trips or sleep overs.  
Absolutely nothing with girl. This shit still bothers my mind. Now they go ""wow you're so old dude go out and find a wife like all your other friends and cousins. bro that shit makes me so mad. They literally went from ""no you cant go there might be girls and we don't trust you to not fool around"" to ""go get a wife you old fuck.""  
Im mid 20s.   
Never had any experiences with drugs, smoking, or alcohol. I tried alcohol once, and it was a few sips. I tried to be civil about it and asked you know, ""man to man"" if I could like have a drink on my 21st, nope. Its always this bullshit of ""Oh I knew a guy, or I heard this story.""  
Never let me do sports cuz I would hurt myself. I finally managed to sign up for soccer in 10th grade but I didnt know any rules, I had no experience, I wasn't even that fit.... It was mess. just felt like a retard chasing balls and getting pushed around.   
My social skills are shit too. I never dated. Pretty much never talked to girls. Im insecure as fuck.   
It literally just feels like I straight up have no life skills. I was refused any learning opportunities as a teenager. im so fucked. Im scared of like everything it feels like. Socializing scares me, going to events scares me. Meeting people and worrying about their impressions of me and all that.  
I have pretty much been brain washed into fearing everything. Its hard to just go out and do what I want to do because I always feel this shadow of my parents harking on me. ""bad things will happen if you dont listen to us"" type shit.  
Anyways, Im going to a party and plan on drinking but I have so much anxiety over it. Im in my mid 20s, I know what my parents say is bullshit, but I cant break it. I know theres nothing wrong with social drinking. I dont plan on blacking out or anything, literally just a drink or 2 to loosen up.  
idk i just feel like im so lost. mid 20s, no social life, no hobbies, no nothing. just deteriorating in my room and getting yelled at for not doing anything.  
Its like I cant go meet people because ""danger, drugs, girls"" but then they expect me to just move out with a life and have a steady career in 2 days?

"The good news is, a little alcohol buzz can be exactly the thing you need to feel more comfortable or at least slow down the racing thoughts. You don't want to learn to rely on that every time you are anxious, but right now when you are just trying to do some of these things for the first time, a party where you can have a drink is in your favor. Just don't overdo it, there is a zone where you are drinking where you feel it relaxing you, and when you're in that state you will automatically start to assume ""more is better, I want this feeling to last"". But you are better off getting to that sweet spot where you feel good and then just try to enjoy it, you'll regret thinking ""I need more"" when you are hugging a toilet later. 

I had parents like that too, I was held back from experiencing a lot, and even up to current day I am then blamed for the weird person I turned out to be who is scared of everything. But you are getting to the age now where they shouldn't have as much power to stop you. You're not wrong for resenting what they did, but nobody is going to come along and try to fix things for you or be understanding, unfortunately in life other people can screw you up and then it is still mainly your problem to deal with and figure out how to get better. 

In pretty much any situation your anxiety is going to have you thinking of things so much worse than what you will actually end up experiencing. Try to just tell your mind to shut up and push those thoughts out when you start worrying about what people will think or what is going to happen. Deep down it really is true that anyone who would be mean or judgmental isn't really someone you should worry about connecting with anyway, good people are kind and considerate and they will want to get to know you even if you display some nervousness or whatever. 

I'd say get a drink or two in you rather quickly, give it time to take effect, and then hopefully you'll feel less anxious. Just don't overdo it until you have more experience with alcohol."	jnnnennnnnpodrods	reply	na	na	na	0.9985197186470032	no	no	no	na	depression

Hmm i once stumbled upon a philosophical theory that triggered mad existential ocd in me. I was unable to go outside at some point. List my uni degree, lost my job, had to live in almost a cave at my dads old house... Next step deeper would only being a psychotic alcoholic on the streets... Idk how to say it but i just kept on trying alltough i had absolutely no hope bc i thought once i am aware of this theory i got aware of there is no turning back from there... But somehow over the years. After being to 8 different therapists, even buddhist monks and psychiatrists and hospitals... I finally got to a point where i realized that folinding a solution to that philosophical topic i obsessed about is not the way. Bc do i want everytime now that something triggers me want to find out to truth about it. It's much better to learn to live with uncertainty... And yeah i know it is a specific story but the happy end more or less turned out i am able to work even 70 hour weeks again, got a new job. Found after 6 failed degrees finally the one that i love but most importantly i learned from it that no matter what happens with enough persistence and just never giving up and keeping on trying even without hope u can get out of almost anything. Even if its a really slow process and u have to conquer a lot of anxiety of calling multiple specialists and so on... But its worth it ...

Every second of every day, all that’s going through my mind is to off myself. I'm 14, and  I've only recently started feeling this way, but I've been feeling pretty flat on emotions for a few years. I recently moved away from the few friends I had. I have no friends now. I have a family of 3 siblings and 2 parents. But no one loves me or even likes me for that manner. I feel empty. I don't know what to do. I believe in God, and I believe that's the only reason I haven't gone through with offing myself yet. I don't know what I'm going to gain from saying all this on Reddit, but I just thought I should.

"Firstly, you’re incredibly brave for reaching out in regards to your feelings. I felt the same way when I was 14 and through most of my teen years-it was hard and lonely and I felt like no one understood or could see my pain, or that anyone even cared. 

I’m much older than you, but I can tell you this. No one can make you hold on. You have to make that choice yourself. But I can tell you if I had let go I would have missed out on the most incredible life, even with severe depression and mental illness. The world is a big and fascinating place, and I’ve traveled all over, lived in some incredible countries, found an interesting career and met and loved many people, some of whom love me back to this day. I also had a year of my life where I did not get out of bed or leave the house due to crippling depression. 

Life comes at us fast and hard, but I believe most of us can find quiet, strong systems of dealing with things that are hurting us, eventually. If you have the option, you may want to consider therapy. Try to find an outlet for yourself-for me it’s been art and writing. Hold on to your talents and develop them if you can. And know some days the goal is simply to make it to the end of the day safely and that’s totally ok. One day at a time. You got this."

"When does this all end? I'm so tired of feeling so empty and broken. In a constant tug of war between ending my life and maybe doing something with my life. Paralyzed by indecision of a career path to choose, or what method of suicide to pick. Unable to choose either I feel stuck. I'm not passionate about anything. I have no skills and I don't know what to study even if I did go to college. It seems everyone even with Bachelors degrees are struggling to find jobs. Will degrees even matter in 5-10 years?

The thing about depression, at least for me, is that it makes life feel so long and almost when unreal. It's unfathomable for me to look at career paths that will be good in 20 plus years. That seems like an eternity. No wonder I only focus on the next couple of days. But before I know it, life has passed me by and I still haven't done anything. 

My boyfriend and I broke up today. This isn't the first time, but this one felt the most real. I love him so much and he loves me. Having gone through depression of his own, he was the most caring, patient and understanding man i could ask for. and i ruined it. he has his life together and i don't. he wants to move out of the state next year for his job and it's embarrassing how little of my shit i have together. I have no career unlike him. when we look at each other, everything feels right. but if we zoom out, being together makes no sense. he's miles ahead of me and deserves so much more. 

god i just wish this emptiness would be over or i could just decide to kill myself already. i can't stay in limbo. It's either death or do something with your life. and maybe your boyfriend will respect you one day and you can have a life together."

"I am really tired and sick of myself, I keep fucking up on each and every small step, I think I am throwing my relationship and most important person in my life into trench by fucking up on smallest things.

Today I asked my gf to make me a tea as I have caught a cold and feel weak. She said in a minute and that was it. But for some reason I just had to act like a smartass and said smth like 'whenever u ask me to do smth for u I do it at once'. I have no idea why I felt need to say it as it wasn't that long before she got up, but I did. She is now disappointed and I cannot seem to convince her that I didn't mean it that way, that I appreciate everything she does for me, that I appreciate everything her existence brings into my life.

Sometimes I think I have got much more than I deserve and its nature's way to bring the balance and taking the harmony that I don't deserve from me. She is the only reason I have not thought of suicide for last three years but during moments like this I really want to throw myself from window as I deserve.

If there are any counselling services provided at your school maybe you can look into that. Don't be disheartened if that doesn't work out.

He says that we don't have money because of me even tho I needed them to refuel my car. He knows that the car is paying our bills yet he does such a thing. I just. Can't go on anymore. I have a suspicion that he is back in contact with his ex-boyfriend and I think he is cheating on me. He doesn’t know it yet but when I will come back home I will ask for his phone. He goes thru my phone while I am asleep so I am gonna do it and make him watch. I am not going to lie but I will read it in front of him. I do not care kinda.

"Sorry for my crappy English.

I (35 y/o, f) logged into my fathers' LinkedIn account and stupid, curious me searched for old classmates. Even the bullies are succesful. It makes me feel so sad, ashamed and disappointed with myself. I never finished college because, well, mental illness developed (panic disorder, ptsd, depression, social phobia, avoidant personality disorder) and I needed lots of therapy. I can't work anymore, instead I go to a daytime facility center for mentally ill three times a week. I enjoy being there, but if I see old classmates having a great job, already being married, becoming parents I sometimes really feel like I want to disappear from everything.

I still feel like I didn’t fulfill my potential and that I’m a slacker because I don’t live in a big house in a big city. I also walk around comparing my physical form to people I see in public trying to assure myself that I’m not too fat, too old looking, or too ugly. 

There are people in my class who are making a shit ton more money than I am who were not concerned with their GPA in high school or college and that makes me feel inadequate. Why do these thoughts plague me when most people think I have done well for myself? 

I was diagnosed with depression after my dad committed suicide in 2004 and didn’t start meds until after his death. He had the same problem comparing himself to his classmates and he was also a high achiever. 

My kids are all adults and none of them have a college degree, none of them do anything that is worth telling people about, but I feel like a loser because they didn’t have high aspirations. Two still live at home with my husband and I, and our youngest who is 22 still doesn’t drive. 

From my experience of comparing myself to everyone around me all the fucking time still when I should be satisfied with my life and know that I don’t have any control over my adult children’s goals in life I hope you understand that there are people out there who don’t even think about how they rank years after high school.

I used to create indie games as a teenager, all the other kids who knew about it thought I was a genius and super cool for that. I’ll occasionally look up the same people online now, and a few of them are now professional programmers. Meanwhile, I lost motivation to keep creating during college when I didn’t have time for it (and also when indie culture became irrelevant), and never regained that motivation.

"Hey all,

I’m going through something and I’d like to know if anyone has went through the same thing too.

I (19M) have had a long history with depression. In April of this year, i fell into depression due to a bad breakup. Truth is, we actually broke up in January but my brain repressed the emotions and they exploded in April.

I was depressed for some time, until a couple of weeks ago. All of a sudden, the thoughts of her stopped, and I felt okay. I was also depressed over not having friends and feeling like my family wasn’t there for me.

It’s just so strange for everything to go away without anything changing. I’m not particularly happy about my life, and the future looks bleak in my eyes. I still don’t have any interests, and I find it so hard to recall my emotions to my therapist. I haven’t worked through the problems I was facing before. The constant pain just disappeared

Am I getting better? Or am I repressing again? Has anyone else gone through this?

I’m worried because I was given antidepressants (Prozac), and I don’t want to take it for no reason"	UsePsychological9074	post	21.852101758329514	male	White	0.968062698841095	na	na	na	0	depression
This is very hard to admit and I am a bit drunk right now as I type this but… I catch myself romanticizing the idea of my death and how peaceful it’d be. Saying goodbye to what seems to feel like endless eternity… I do also think of the pain and despair I’d cause to my friends and loved ones but something so peaceful and so comforting about the idea of death… I don’t know how else to explain it. I’m almost 24 years old but I fear the idea of even getting past 40. I don’t know what my future holds but I am content and peaceful with the idea of my death. I only wish to ask whatever god or almighty being out there to just let it be peaceful, whenever the time comes.	secretiveanon	post	21.751501228509927	female	White	0.0015833312645554543	na	na	na	0	depression

Im 18F, by book, everything seems to be ‘perfect’ for me. I did great in highschool, I just recently graduated. I’m going to college and don’t have to worry about funds because it is a cheap nearby college, and I am extremely fortunate that my parents will be covering the costs. I have a very promising future ahead for myself, a good boyfriend, a best friend. It seems good, and it is, but I can’t help but feeling this way. I’m terrified of life, to the point where it’s debilitating sometimes. I just got my license in the medical field, and during my clinicals it was really hard on me. I saw stuff not many people see and it made me see firsthand the brutal, cold, malicious, and inconsolable type of suffering that exists within life. It terrified me to think this could be me, or any of my loved ones of any moment. I’ve always struggled with anxiety and this made it worse. Additionally, as much as I have an everlasting gratitude for my laborious parents/ family I was sexually abused for years by a very very very close relative. I never told anyone I don’t think I ever will, even writing it here is difficult, but, it is anonymous and gives background to my story. Now you can see where my tribulations begin to unfold. From the bat, these unsolicited sexual advances from ages 5-14 have made me view life as cold and disgusting. I mean no harm to any theist individuals reading this, but this is why I personally have never associated myself with the philosophies of an organized religion. Because, I think to myself, how could a god have let this happen to me. I feel so betrayed for the little girl within me, and the girl that grew up to become me. This has stuck with me ever since. I don’t remember much from my childhood, I was depressed for the most of it and largely because of my mom. Although we are in good terms now, the self-hating thoughts that she has inadvertently engrained in me, also stick with me. I have always been a person who craves affection, yet I didn’t really receive that in my childhood. I just remember feeling degraded. I remember sobbing on my bathroom floor one night in middle school, begging, sobbing, to a god if he was listening, to put me to rest so that I no longer experienced anything bad; I was so tired. In middle school and high school I also felt really insecure and not good enough for myself, peers, and the others around me—yet another layer to add onto my onion of emotional baggage.  Now, I have all this attached to me and have this incessant feeling that I’m not good enough, and that no one will love me like I love them. This really hurts me because my greatest desire in life has been to feel like someone loves me as much as I love them. I love my boyfriend more than anything, but even he has admitted that I’m too much for him, I really try my best to grow and progress as a person, but it’s hard, it seems like my efforts are stagnant. Additionally, as I grow and have these realizations of the disgusting world around us : rapings, genocides, human trafficking, child pornography, kidnappings, gruesome homicides, the list goes on, I realize the sadistic and dystopian life we currently live in. I don’t want to live in a world like this, it’s scary and it’s hard. I always think to myself that I never asked to be born in this world, I have never felt meant for this world, yet I am forced to live through its motions. It hurts me that I have thought this way even as such a young girl, she didn’t deserve that. I know I’d hurt so many by killing myself, I’d hate to inflict that type of pain, so I won’t. But it makes me more depressed thinking about the fact that I have to go on in this cruel, cruel world. Everything seems pointless. Now, I’m stuck in this grey area, craving an unreversible, eternal solitude, but that is its biggest, most unforgiving price: eternity in the unknown.

Wow. I can relate to you on so much. My own father touched me as a child. He was/is an alcoholic too. I’m in school as well and just trying to get by. I had a very bad childhood because of my parents. Besides my dad touching me or purposely walking in the bathroom while i was showering when i visited him then laughing about it, my mom on the other hand can be narcissistic, verbally and physically abusive. Her husband encouraged her abuse for years and called it “discipline”. He’s part of the reason she is the way she is and it’ll never change. I haven’t gotten apologies or clarity on almost all the things i endured by them, yet they walk around so careless and unbothered.. almost as if those things never happened. Then here i am stuck and trying to heal and move on from all that trauma. I wondered why me? why are these things happening to me? why would God allow that? This guided me to learning about religion and now I’m a revert to Islam."	Any_Mathematician790	reply	na	na	na	0.01898389309644699	weak	strong	no	na	depression
"What helps me feel better is studying history.  Especially WW2 in the Asian theater or Eastern European theater.   I’m not gonna say what I’ve learned but studying made me feel grateful.  As these people in those times and other times went through way worse situations than I have ever been.

Doctors said ""you have bipolarism or paranoid schizophrenia, we don't know!"". I left without treatment. A few months after I got out of the hospital, I got a job in a store, it was very tiring, but I got used to it. At the end of 1 month, they sent me to another store and on my first day in my new store, I felt like my heart would explode. I felt very bad and left.

TW suicide/SH

Hey everyone, I’m so confused. Please help with trying to explain what this is. 

For context, I have suffered through depression and anxiety for the past 3 years and it’s been up and down, but I feel like it’s spiraling again. I have been inpatient a couple times for attempt/ideation. I have struggled w alcohol abuse and still am struggling with self harm. I have been in therapy but currently am not in it due to insurance issues. 

I suffer from deep loneliness and usually have nobody to share with because they’d just refer me to therapy and I am not able to vent because they say they cannot help me. Recently I had a severe depressive episode and insisted on attempting again to multiple people, and then I got their messages saying something along the lines of “I can’t help you anymore.”

Because of this, there’s now a voice in my head with a name who insists on protecting me from the world after I’ve been hurt by so many people. This voice is not letting me share anything sensitive to anyone and is taking over my texts to some people, saying “I am protecting [my name]. [my name] is gone and I am keeping them safe.”

Please help, I don’t know what this is. I am fully aware of this thing and their intentions, and I know I can control it but it seems to control me more. 

Thank you."	throwaway839137	post	36.48443130254771	female	White	0.9895464777946472	na	na	na	1	depression
"Head to the psych ward. NOW. Hearing and interacting with voices in your head that you feel are separate from your own self, is a sign of psychosis. There is such a thing as psychotic depression.

I hope this gets resolved soon. And don't forget to tell them about your suicidal ideation!"	throwaway839137	reply	na	na	na	0.9895464777946472	weak	no	no	na	depression
"TL;DR: I struggle to live with the shame of surviving my suicidal ideation.

I think a big change that I could aim for, that could fundamentally alter my day to day existence, is if I could see surviving, or living, as something that could be done courageously. 

The hardest part, for me, regarding surviving my depression, surviving my periods of suicidal intent, was surviving them not because of hope or courage, but because of cowardice. I had completely given up, with no hope of redemption or recovery. The only thing I wanted to do was die, but I lacked the courage to take my own life.

There is a quote that summarizes this perfectly, but I can't locate the author:
""Hell is having no will to live and no courage to die.""

The cowardice seems to have two sources: the obvious fear of pain (I had always planned to slit my wrists) and the fear that this was, in fact, not the bottom. That my depression was me clinging to the slimy wall of an infinitely deep dark well, clinging with all my strength, but inexorably sliding downward in fits and starts, and my hope was that death would bring an end to this excruciating striving, but what if it didn't? What if death just pulled me from the wall, to drop, infinitely, into the well?

So I live, but in shame. And in fear of being shamed, of people bearing witness to this shameful existence, I hide away from the world. I don't want to go out, and when I do, I put as much mask on as I can. I resolve to let no glimmer of the self show through.

This mask is cheerful and painful and requires an enormous amount of energy to keep up. I am not conscious of it every second, and my battery seems to drain suddenly and all at once and then I need to be home, instantaneously, and alone, completely. To hedge against this collapse, I do everything on as small a scale as possible, every visit as quick as possible, every project as unambitious as possible, with exits planned at every stage.

The advice I've received relating to this is along the lines of survival not being a reflection of cowardice, or a cause for shame, and trying to internalize that. Like most of therapy, that advice has not helped me. Upon reflection, after over a decade of stop-start therapy, I think its ""hit rate"" of imparting actionable advice and practical skills is less than 5%.

Because I was there, the day when the strength of men failed (hehe).

So I have to acknowledge this narrative: that I _have been_ a coward, that I _have been_ defeated, beaten, bloody and _completely broken_. And I have been granted respite, not because I deserved it, but _because of my weakness_. 

All I can do now, is attempt to be courageous today. But I don't know how to start. Any advice or experience with this topic is appreciated."	RoniIvanov	post	25.28798996845531	female	White	0.9978055357933044	na	na	na	0	depression

"I’m (19f) just so sick of being treated like a nuisance and a burden. My dad does not speak to me. Th situation with my mom can be summed up like,,,, i remember once a few months ago, my mom came to the apartment my brother and I were staying in, to set up a a TV. She told me she was there because she loved me and wanted to spend time with me, and then immediately went back to her partners house. after asking if I felt like she was “abandoning me” in the process. 

For context, I had said that I felt like she did not want to be around me a week prior, as I hadn’t spent more than twenty minutes with her since I got out of the psych ward, the month beforehand. I was starving myself at the time too. I could see my eye sockets poking through my cheeks. But she felt content to leave.

She hurt me a lot these past 20 years, but I love her all the same. She was the last person I thought I could go to, but it seems every time I tell her something weighing on me, if it’s even remotely critical of the her she finds a way to satirize it. 

And every time she does (and to be honest, quite often in general), I just imagine killing myself in the most horrific ways. throwing myself off the staircase and opening my head on the wooden floor of my living room, at night, or hanging myself from the ceiling fan like a shitty paper garland.

Oh, and on top of this, I’m trans. My extended family looks at me like I am a leper. 40 percent of my country doesn’t think I should exist and, in my own case, I thoroughly fucking agree with them

To relieve her, and everyone else, of the burden I am in the most thorough way possible, almost feels like the punchline of a joke. Like, you all asked for this, so here it is!

"I have come to find it difficult to see the point of late. What's the point of living, staying alive? I, like I'm sure most of you have heard all that live for the small things, happy moments and family. And that's kinda what I've been doing.
3 years ago I tried to take myself out and just some weeks ago when I was feeling bad I wrote down all good and amazing things that had happened in those 3 years I almost didn't live to see and yet again I'm feeling awful. 
Things have changed in 3 years but still I feel awful in most days. There are good days and really good days too but if most days are horrible then what's the point. How long can I really keep going with just those few good days every now and then. 
This planet is horrible. I hate humans, despise most of us. I'm a black queer person living in a very racist and transfobic country so most people hate me already when they see me. I used t enjoy going out alone but just don't feel safe doing that ether. My neigbhours are super racist and have already yelled that they wanna beat me up so rearly do I even want to leave my appartment. I even loved going to the movies but don't like to do that anymore couse they end so late and I don't want to walk alone to home at late time anymore. I hate my stupid disgusting body and my useless autistic brain. I can't make friends becouse my neurodivergend brain can't work with people. I try and try but just can't make a connection.
And becouse of my brain I can't seem to do anything else either. I really really try to find work and hold on to the job when I do but I just can't. Becouse my stupid autism I just can bearly do all the basic task to keep myself alive. I really want to try and I do try to find a good job and work on my dreams but I just can't do it and that's why everyone is constantly so dissapointed in me. They say that I'm lazy but I promise I'm not, I really do try. Just seems like everyone else can do this human thing and I can't. Everyone else seems to have some grazy instructions to what to do at alltimes and I don't. 
Every night it's so hard to sleep becouse I just think about all the horrible things. I'm scared for my sister who lives alone and one ofe the people who I love the most, my grandfather is getting very old and I just can't even think about losing him. I can't. I pray that I go before he goes that is a pain I just wouldn't be able to handle. 
I don't want to killmyself. I really want to live and experience but it's just sometimes so hard to see the point in trying if this is all gonna be awful anyway.

Thanks for sharing! I feel myself burn out mentally after a normal days work, even without attempting other mentally strenuous activities afterwards. I end up just getting lost in other worlds in video games to recharge for the next day. It seems like you set pretty high expectations for yourself..can see why you would feel sapped. When you write, what do you write about? And for what purpose do you write? Are you writing to produce something commercially viable, writing for fun/to relax, or writing just to organize your thoughts from what you go through each day? If you're feeling like you need to force yourself to write, maybe you're writing something that's a bit too mentally taxing with everything else going on right now. For example my wife likes to write.. but too taxing for her to come up with unique ideas out of the blue. So she writes fan fiction instead, just for fun. It still helps develop her skills, but isn't as difficult to get words out since she's working with characters that are somewhat defined by an existing series. There's websites for it where people read each other's stories and comment, a nice community. So if that sort of writing is relaxing to you, maybe you could try something like that to mentally recharge. Or could just take a break from writing to focus on those other aspects of life. You don't need to be at 100% all the time. There's no shame in needing time to recharge, especially when you're trying to juggle other aspects of life. It's OK to focus on one or two things at a time, prioritizing what is most important to you at that time of your life.	kaptn_	reply	na	na	na	0.9986448884010315	weak	strong	no	na	depression

"Does anyone else here take their welbutrin at night? When it was prescribed to me I was told to take it in the morning. I used to take my Lexapro at night and I took it every day, no problem.

"I reached my absolute worst point about four and a half years ago, and somehow was able to get through it without hospitalization or a suicide attempt.  For the last three years I’ve somehow managed to delude myself into thinking that things might actually turn out okay, that I may actually manage to get my life back at some point.  Now everything is going to hell all over again and I’m terrified of going through all that trauma all over again, or worse.  

I have CFS constantly draining my energy, serious depression and my heart is pounding all the time, causing adrenaline rushes through my system and scaring me so much that I begin to cry my eyes out.  I also have OCD and the horrible intrusive thoughts/urges are returning.  I am behaving too recklessly and compulsively for a person in my condition and I need to stop but I don’t know how.  I am so deeply restless all day long but too sick to add in more activity.  I am afraid I am only making myself worse and potentially heading toward the death spiral.

The worst of all though are these empty feelings inside.  Feeling like I don’t truly care about anyone.  Feeling like I don’t actually want to get better.  Feeling like I don’t actually want love.  Feeling like nothing is important to me except sensation and stimulation, a stimulation that is always too intense for me and a stimulation that can only make me sicker inside and out.

"Trigger warning for suicidal thoughts.

Hi, I (26m) have been with my girlfriend (26) for about 7 years since we met in university. We have lived together for about 5 of those years and both love eachother a great deal. These last 2 years have been awful for us.

She has been extremely depressed for these 2 years following adoption of our 2 dogs. We adopted them 6 months apart both as puppies (the first was 4months old rescued from Romania, the second was a young puppy sold by someone local).

She loves the dogs more than anything but resents the fact we adopted them entirely. The first dog developed behaviour problems and can't be trusted with other dogs outside and is a potential bite risk for people. Meaning we can't get help to do anything nice from anyone without the stress of them being attacked.

We have talked about all of this a lot and it feels like we have covered every option and nothing feels like an answer.
She has told me that she wants to kill herself and has set a date for 2 years from now to ""accept it and at least try to enjoy the remaining time"". She went to see a therapist for a couple months but decided it wasn't for her and is completely against antidepressants and doctors after having bad experiences with them in the past. She won't tell anyone else about our problems because doesn't want to burden anyone.

We initially planned to travel together throughout our 20s, but the choices we made seem to have made that impossible and now with the realisation that we are stuck with the dogs until we're 40 she just doesn't want to continue.

She would rather die than give them up for adoption to someone else. I will stress that these dogs are greatly cared for and want for nothing. They are her children in her eyes. Which just makes it so much harder.
I don't know what to do and am here asking for any advice on what I can do to try and make sure the worst doesn't happen, I am desperate.

Long time partner wants to kill herself because we are trapped in an unfulfilling life with no obvious way out. I am desperately trying to get any advice on how I can help her."	MoleRatMasseuse	post	32.33300371344947	female	White	0.9979677796363831	na	na	na	5	depression

1. Finding out about the issue,
2. Finding the solution to the issue,
3. Finding the motivation to start the effort to complete the solution.

If she doesn't want to cooperate or thinks you're being weird, tell her that her thoughts of suicide are haunting you and are making you concerned. If she doesn't care, then she's the one being selfish here as she's not open in trying to be getting somewhere with you.

If she's open, you have written down all the things currently keeping you both from happiness. 

Then you'll go find a solution, it doesn't need to be found in this same conversation and make that clear to her. 

Note down all things that could help you out of this situation, do research of all options and write down the success rate of it all.

Now you'll show her the solution(s) you'll have and make her think about all of them. No rush just hand it out.

When she agrees on any of these solutions, you'll need to make a plan to keep both of you to stick to this solution.


Now I'll give you my personal opinion:

The fact that she's planned to kill herself in 2 years makes her a selfish person that doesn't care enough about your dogs at all. She will leave them behind no matter what, then what's the point of now being depressed about the dogs?

It sounds like you both need to find a way to give these dogs a good permanent home elsewhere, so you can continue with your plans to travel abroad if that's where your happiness is to be found.

It also sounds like she wants you to make the decision of getting rid of the dogs, so she won't need to feel completely responsible and guilty of making this decision when anyone of your social circle asks."	MoleRatMasseuse	reply	na	na	na	0.9979677796363831	no	no	no	na	depression

"I remember when I was young adult people often said you have time and it gets better; for me it has not, I thought when I got a house (which has a great view) and be independent life would get better. It didn't, the amount of work a house requires and then neighbourhood politics arrrrggghh, but that's manageable however unpleasant it can be (alright I'm being a little unfair there, we all mostly get on).

I loved a woman but it didn't work out, this was many years ago it's not a recent thing, I have had relationships since then but it'll never be her. She had a Morticia Addams vibe, she was so kind hearted.

I also have aspergers next to no one gets me, I have dealt with bullies since the 90s I've gotten good at that but it isolates you further. When I talk to people I'm always trying to figure out their angle.

My parents are ill (one is dying) and the other is in denial. Most of my friends (which being autistic weren't exactly easy to make) are dead.

"Hi,

i am at a very deep point in my life right now. I never had an relationship with a women. Never felt the warmth of another human near me. Today I was at a club with some friends and saw so many couples 20-30 years old. I missed that time completely out. There is no chance to make it all right.That time is lost. 
And i feel there is no way to get a girlfriend for me now either. 

I know, what could you guys do about it? You don't even know me. It's my fault, that's obvious.

 I just wanted to write that down, cause i'm so down right now. Life is cool and stuff. I love traveling and so much more. But everything makes absolutely no sense, if you have no one to share it with. I think, that I'm losing my will of life again. I have so much love to give.

SHEESH mofo a&$ homie I don’t even be getting women no more, don’t even try to my full extent but idek no more I lost my confidence, gained weight, lost it but nah man I want a girl in my life but I don’t at the same time I miss the company, the love, the reassurance, what else more could a person ask for.

I have no purpose in my life and I don’t really care to find one. I don’t want to do anything. The only things that sound remotely interesting to me are unobtainable without at least a decade of hardwork and I simply do not care enough to put that work in. If I were given those things today I wouldn’t even want them because I would feel like a fraud/loser. I genuinely do not see a way out of this mindset and it’s gotten to the point that I think the most economical move would be to just end it. I don’t want people’s time, effort and support to be wasted on me. I hate every aspect of my being and instead of dragging out a mediocre existence it just seems best to call it quits. I don’t want any sympathy or for people to feel bad for me I just don’t want to be here anymore. Not a single reason to wake up in the morning. I literally care about nothing. Every day is a task and I feel like I’m just wandering pointlessly. Every ounce of self belief is gone and I see not metaphorical light at the end of the tunnel. I guess I’m just writing this to get it off my chest so I can at least say I didn’t hold it all in.

"Your friend is lucky to have someone looking out. Not sure if there is “an” answer, but my best friends have helped me in different ways at different times, and they don’t always even know it. 

Here are a couple ideas:
1. Let him know he can be open with you about what’s going on. Some times just being able to talk/yell/cry and have a friend give you a hug is the best. 
2. Make a plan to do something fun in the near future like a go to concert or take a trip.
3. Getting “through” depression is a tough thing. I’ve lived with it my whole life, and realizing that it’s the way my brain works has really helped me take action on my own to live a healthier life. Letting him know that it’s ok to feel the way he feels is also a thing. 
4. If he’s not getting professional help, you can encourage him or share resources with his family (not sure of the situation there). I resisted this when I was younger because I thought it was a sign of weakness. Boy was I wrong!
5. Take care of yourself. 

For context, I’m 38 y.o. male who has been experiencing depression since 13 and did not treat it until my early 30s. Advice I’d give to younger me is to start working on it now.

"I do have depression, but I also have crazy fatigue and I don't know if it's something separate or just depression.

What happens is I can sleep all day and still feel tired.  Often times on the weekend I will sleep all day Saturday and all day Sunday as well.  This is in addition to sleeping at night.
After sleeping all day I'm still tired and my whole body hurts.  Especially my neck and back, which have pretty bad degenerative disc disease, but everything hurts at a lower level.  It also feels kind of hard to breathe, and my guts hurt.  Sometimes it feels like I'm dying if I stay in bed long enough.  It seems like it's never enough sleep either, I just sleep longer and longer and keep feeling worse and worse.

"I am curious to know people’s thoughts on this. I grew up quite isolated and my primary escape had always been books, movies and music.

Nerdy kid gets bitten by radio-active bug and his life turns upside down. Shy kid gets bullied and turns into a rockstar after writing songs about it. I grew up reading about these, watching these and thought maybe there’s a meaning to my pain and when some miracle like this happens my pain will be all worth it. It took me way too long to realize how these expectations do not come true for most if not all, I almost couldn’t accept it and my depression steadily got worse. 

Can anybody relate to this ?"	Sad-Divide8352	post	27.112206954449274	male	White	0.9931110143661499	na	na	na	3	depression
"Yeah, I can relate. Emotional neglect in my childhood lead me to reading alot of fantasy and science fiction.

No parent was willing to teach the hard truths of life. At school they only encourage you to think of grades as being sucessful and happy in the future. 

For the media, they teach you that somehow justice exist. Everything will be ok in the end. And if you are kind to other people, other people would do the same. This somehow led to me being a pushover. And not having any sense of boundaries. I am trying to give up all these expectations. Except I have no idea what to believe in anymore."

"Seriously.  If someone else said half the things to us that we say to ourselves, we'd have punched them by now.  Yeah, I get it -- in our minds we're all fat, lazy, worthless sacks of shit who have wasted our lives.  Hell, it might even be true.  But, we can be kind for the sake of our future selves.  We can stop comparing where we are to where we think we should be, and can instead try to make the best of the situation at hand.  If nobody is there to help, it's time to be the person we need -- even if it takes longer than we'd like it to, and even if it's not clear that it'll make every problem go away.  Get that inner monologue right, and be a little more proud of having made it this far.  

By the way, that doesn't mean to stay positive all the time.  Sometimes this world is positively awful.   
 But, learning to forgive yourself is important, and saying ""you were trash, but but it's okay and you're still worthy of being loved"" is better than just saying ""you're trash"".

"I'm \[20F\] and a college student. I have a year left of degree. 

I'm ending things if I don't get the outcomes I wan't by next year. 

I want to be in a relationship, get a nice job, have a child in my 20s but that's just someone else's life I guess. I'll probably just work and die and no one will give a shit about me.

My dad wants me to be childfree. He hates people giving birth and having kids and he doesn't want me to ever have sex and get pregnant and have a baby. I get depressed every time I see women and their partners and their parents cheering them on with their personal life or having kids when my dad doesn't even want to be a grandpa. Also, I'll never experience any thing I mentioned above so why do I care?

Everything is far-fetched. I don't even have a boyfriend. Men don't like me. I'm a fat and ugly brown girl. No one wants to date me or get entangled with me and my dad's feelings toward this make everything worse. I don't wear feminine clothing and everything I wear is for boys. I mean guys tell me I look like a boy facial wise as well. I am a boy I guess, I have to work like one and behave like one and live life like on. I have a slow metabolism. I eat and I get fat. I have acne. I am always dealing with digestive issues. 

People around me are dating and soon they will move in and have children or travel the world. I'm here just rotting and studying and just going to work and die forever. 

I'm giving up if I don't find a partner that likes me by next year. When I'll graduate I'll probably just move in with my parents anyways and I'll work till I die. Or worse I'll have to move out and stay in a 1 bedroom apartment by myself and be single for the rest of my life with no money in my bank account.

With how my life is going to turn out with not having any biological children in my 20s or no partner to procreate with I just think not living is better than just working my ass off.

I do not remember a time I was not severely depressed. 27 years in and nothing I do has any meaning.

I do not have the energy to clean the pile of rubbish off my floor. I do not have the energy to get out of bed, I do not have the energy to eat and regularly starve myself, other days I am a glutton as eating temporarily takes away the suicidal thoughts.

I have wanted to kill myself so many times, still do. Only thing that’s kept me alive is family, can’t disappoint them or make them sad. When they’ve gone, I’ll probably join them.

People kept telling me it’ll fade and there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. It’s all a lie to me, there is no light only 27 years of darkness. I’ve been in therapy many times, it’s never helped.

Listen, you feel you're rejected by everyone in real life and that's that. But I don't think you should reject yourself. It took me years to figure out, that if you feel there's no one in this world for you, who gets you and understands you, YOU have to become that person. Stand up for yourself, do things you like, take yourself out, explore your music taste, start doing things with yourself, hangout with yourself and get to know you better. And slowly but surely, when you're more comfortable with yourself, start getting out, talk casually with acquaintances or neighbors  or whomever.

Basically the way to love yourself is to do whatever you like. Spoil yourself. You want icecream? Get icecream. Don't listen to any negative thoughts and only focus on what you want. Honestly, you can even compare it to treating yourself as a child. Take care of yourself, pamper yourself and watch yourself grow!

"I was taught to be pretty subservient growing up as it was “the Christian way” and I’d get reprimanded if I put myself over “religion” or others.

I don’t know if it’s the case, but it could play a part in my lack of ability in saying no to others, and why I do feel used constantly.

Rather than learn for myself, it filled me with a ton of existential worry but now I reached a point where I don’t care anymore.

"I live in a religious environment as well (divorce isn’t even allowed here, which played a part in fucking up 99% of my childhood). What I learned about all religions is this, sometimes the religion is the problem, but most of the time the people are the problem. I grew up with people who would use religion as a way to shame, exclude, guilt, and validate their wrongdoings. It really fucks with your head because if everyone is doing it, why shouldn’t I? It felt like being watched with a security camera 24/7, unable to just BE without the afterthought of guilt and shame rising up.

At 14 I realized something was wrong, and had portrayed myself as a Christian when I was secretly informing myself of different views and ideologies, taking in different types of content so I could learn how to think for myself. I am now an atheist and although I get some nasty looks (even from people I barely know when they ask me what my religion is) I seriously couldn’t care less. 

The way minds work, they hold on to learned behaviors and patterns formed through repetition, the patterns from childhood being the hardest to break. It worked for me eventually, repeating my ideal thought process and repeatedly checking myself when I get too hive minded or start feeling guilty or anxious about topics like death etc. 

But then, nothing works better than distancing from the people who think like that and surrounding yourself with people who are against it.

"I'm extremely sensitive to noise, to the point where I have several pair of earplugs and over ear muffs that I use together whenever possible to try to minimize the noise from the world around me as much as possible, I even have to use a pair while at work so I don't go insane with all the costumers and cars and everything else.

The thing is, I live in an EXTREMELY FUCKING LOUD neighbourhood where **every. single. person.** has a speaker with which they spend their entire days and nights just blasting their trash and LOUD music into eachothers' windows for some fucking reason, and of course I get caught in the crossfire; plus everyone here has dogs that just bark at everything 25 hours per day and there's a very busy road that gets a lot of trucks and heavy vehicles constantly a couple of houses down from mine. Basically: I don't have a single second of silence in which I can spend trying to form a single thought. The only way I can try to mitigate all of this is by using all of my earplugs and muffs in an ATTEMPT at getting some semblance of silence. It's not enough. I can't deal with this shit anymore. Everyday when I get home from work and get greeted by these fucking inconsiderate, deaf assholes blowing out my eardrums I just want to fucking end it.

I can deal with the loneliness of not having a single person in my life, I've been in this position for forever now. I can deal with having a horrible job that destroys my body and soul every second I'm there. I can deal with not having a single hope for anything anymore and not seeing any future for myself which doesn't include me just dying by myself and by own hands. I CANNOT deal with not being able to have a MINUTE of silence at MY OWN HOME to even HEAR MY OWN THOUGHTS. 

ALL I WANTED WAS A SECOND OF FUCKING SILENCE TO FUCKING **THINK**.

But I guess that's asking for too much huh? Guess I can't even enjoy my own escapism through reading and music anymore either huh? Guess I can't have the one fucking thing that brought me some sort of joy in this life: being able to put on my headphones and just enjoy some of my favorite songs. No. That's too much to ask for. I have to work all day every day with MAYBE a day off every two weeks, just to get home and get my ears destroyed by the entire world around me non-stop.

I can't even sleep anymore, the only way I can fall asleep is by exhausting myself until I collapse on my bed, I usually just try to watch something on youtube until my eyes start to burn and I start to drift away.

"Noise triggers me as well and I live in a flat. What is thr NRR of your ear muff? Try getting those 28 NRR. They are used for shooting range, absolutely blocks out any frequency. The only downside is my own tinnitus and the soreness of wearing them for a long time.

Does white noise calm you down in anyway? Have you checked them out?

For noise issue, if silence is not available, you can either mask it, cancel it or block it.

White noise is one of the ways for masking. Just YouTube white noise. It's sound that's in certain frequency that is calming to our brain. This is not bullshit trust me. There's some Bose headset that provides some soothing sound for sleeping. 

For noise cancelling, you can try those true noise cancellation earphones. Air pods or Bose quiet comfort I heard is not bad. What it does is there's a built in tech that can detect the ambient noise and reduce it when the sound reaches your ear.

For blocking, you can look into sound proofing. This might cost quite a bit of money but if this is your own house, then this is probably the best long term solution. Windows and doors are the most critical places to block the sounds. There's curtains and materials like rock wool that's good for absorbing the Soundwave. You might need to consult a sound proofing contractor for this. It can be done, just like how a home studio can be sound proofed.

"When I was 20 my sister's best friend (a guy she also has a long-time crush on) hung himself.  It was truly unexpected although it later came out that his paternal uncle had suffered a similar fate.  


My initial reaction wasn't grief or sadness or the horror that later followed.  My immediate thought was ""Oh, he beat me to it!"". 


I had had no previous overt suicidal ideations. No thoughts of actual self harm.  One thing was clear though, I was ... disappointed. My boyfriend at the time broke the news to me.  When he reached out to hug/comfort me, I recoiled from his touch.  I quickly apologized and passed it off as shock.  I've never told a soul. 


But that moment 'solidified' my depression.  Or at least unveiled it.  I've not been able to contain it since and often think back to that time as the beginning of this dreadful journey.  It's been about 20 years since and I can count my good days on 1 hand.  Is this what life has to offer? Fewer than 5 good days?  The disappointment has never left."

"hi! sorry i just need to let this all out and i don’t really want to tell any one of my closest friends about this because i don’t need more people to be disappointed with me lol

so a little background, i’m a 23-year old female and ever since i was a kid, i’ve always wanted to be a doctor. the pandemic messed that up so now i’m living with depression and crippling anxiety every day for the past three years now. now this isn’t ideal for me because it resulted to me not graduating on time, therefore delaying my admission to medschool and messing up my parents’ life plan for themselves and for me and my sister.

when in-face classes began last year, i immediately flew back to uni to complete my thesis. the problem is, i still had depression and anxiety so i ended up only doing half of the supposedly thesis work (i did not do the experiment, so i have no results and no paper to produce). i’m currently enrolled in my hometown’s medical school (i was hoping i wouldn’t get in but i did) and now my parents are pressuring me to follow up on my thesis adviser for my grades because they’re worried that the medschool might debar me if they found out that i haven’t graduated yet because i don’t have my thesis grade. i’ve been telling them that my adviser hasn’t been replying to me (which is true since it would take her like a week minimum to respond to my emails unless i personally go to her). i’ve neglected to inform them that the reason why i don’t have my grades yet is because i actually haven’t done the experiment yet and not because i haven’t defended it yet like i told them.

i know i should tell them the truth soon but i’m so scared of them being disappointed in me again. but the anxiety of the time passing by is making me freeze and all i could do is just watch it eventually come back to bite me in the ass. i mean, how am i supposed to tell them that i’ve been lying to them and that i could actually be debarred from medschool?

i don’t honestly see how i could get past this and every day i wake up, i feel so sad and upset that i didn’t die in my sleep."	saachii606	post	17.517933452873983	female	White	0.9990934133529663	na	na	na	1	depression
This is rough. I’m in the same boat you’re in with the mental health stuff. If it makes you feel any better, I’ve failed the last 3 years of college since COVID because of my mental health challenges (I was physically to scared to go to class. Not cause of COVID, just cause of everything). I’m looking at 7 years of college while my friends already graduated. It sucks. But at the same time we have to pick ourselves back up, and live life right, even if it doesn’t make sense right now. Tell your parents, sure they’ll be mad, but they’re your parents and I’m sure they love you more than anything in the world.	saachii606	reply	na	na	na	0.9990934133529663	weak	strong	no	na	depression

"Just call it what it is. It’s not “gaming the shitty feelings away” it’s actually “having fun” 

When we’re chronically depressed we tell ourselves we don’t deserve to have fun and it’s a self-perpetuating lie that you need to actively address in your head

The truth is everybody else is gaming, doom scrolling, tiktoking their lives away. I’m from the Oregon trail generation. Before all this tech, man life was rich full of experience. Coffee shops were full of people, there were punk shows every weekend. There was so much to do. I recently watched a very popular independent coffee shop close its door. The pace was packed every single night. Some nights you had to stand. The last few days of business it was just a very small daytime clientele, nights didn’t exist anymore.

I wish I could say it would, but I don’t know. And I think it’s naive to say that it necessarily will. Im sorry you’re going through whatever you are. I think at the end of the day we are born alone, and we die alone. We come into this world only within ourselves, never fully within somebody else’s mind. I think in some ways I’ve come to peace with that, knowing that even though I will die on my own one day, so will every other person on this earth. So in that way, you’re never truly alone. We all go back into the dirt from which we came. I know it doesn’t change much, but for me in times of thinking it might all end, it brought me some peace to know that.	in-the_void	reply	na	na	na	0.9984288811683655	strong	no	no	na	depression

"**Sorry for the essay in advance **

To all the kids here and OP who are depressed here, I'll just give a piece of advice if I may. While it's good to have the community to lean on, and in the last few months I have myself done it, I'd say to any kid not to dwell too much on this subreddit at every moment. We're all going through stuff, and while I know it doesn't help when you're in the depths of hell, it can be very demoralising seeing non-stop negativity when you come on here. It looks ridiculously worse in writing than what I'm trying to portray, but just try not to get too obsessed with it. You are all still extremely young, and while I'm not trying to invalidate your feelings at all, because I've had my rough years during the teens as well, there will be better times in the future. If it was all nothing but bad every day, every week, every month and every year, then the global population would be gone due to suicide. There will be many tough, horrible and difficult situations in your future, there will also be many pleasant, fun, exciting feelings that'll make you wonder how you ever felt so low. Life is up and down, sometimes more down than up, but being happy at every moment would be just as much a cause for concern as being depressed all the time. Take pleasure in the simple things, and try not to take too much of social media to heart, because everyone looks like they're living the high life on it. That's not reality. I wish you all, especially the kids, the best of luck. Don't take everything the doom mongers say as absolute fact. We're all on our own journey of discovery, and your experience will differ from others. I say this all from my 35 years on this Earth, of which 20 years ago I never would have said."	biryanilover09	reply	na	na	na	0.9992897510528564	weak	strong	no	na	depression

As someone of 22(F) I can say that depression sometime, depending on the person, doesn’t get easier with age, but as you grow it gets easier to handle and if you can find someone (anyone) to talk to that UNDERSTANDS it helps.

But you can do this : stare right in the face of that loneliness,  sadness,  incredible depression that gets you're body so weak you can barely move or puts you're mind in a state of not wanting to move or continue to go on because that's actually what  you want and take it. You need a special purpose. For special people like us, that don't go along with a normal line of life, you have to accept the fact that it probably won't  get better or maybe to a small point but that will be the most you'll get.

i might post something like this in a weed forum bc … i feel like im not there just so dumb and slow and my memory is bad 

BUT 

when it comes to feeling like an NPC: 
• i completely forgot how to talk to ppl. 
      - i’ve isolated myself almost always for the past couple years and did not help 

• haven’t watched tv or movies like i used to. nothing interests me but i used to loveee film 


• speaking of low interest. almost nothing excites me or brings me any sense of satisfaction / fulfillment. i so desperately want to have my own hobbies and niches . 
     -  i wasn’t too big on hobbies bf feeling like this from always being tired w school but i just want to enjoy myself. work towards something . have something that i like to do. 

• music doesn’t feel the same. the first time i lost connection w music was thee worst, like couldn’t listen at all, but it’s really never gotten to what it used to be… i used to only want to do music in some way. i miss the drive so much 

i want to have friends i want to feel normal !!!!!! i just literally don’t know how

But I would ask her to please not joke about something so serious. But she never listened, and I went off on her one day. I know I shouldn't have, but I was 15. No one would listen to me. I tried telling my parents, but they threatened to throw me out onto the streets for being so ungrateful. I figured that if I wasn't going to get therapy, or validation from my family, at the very least, I didn't want to hear about suicide. But my friend kept going against my wishes, even though she said she wasn't going to talk about suicide anymore.

This is very understandable, but please understand that people have very different ways of coping with their feelings. Humor is a very strong way of feeling better for some, even if it might not feel great for you.	Affectionate_Hat494	reply	na	na	na	0.998292863368988	weak	no	no	na	depression
i just need to vent. i have no one to go to. i mean nothing to no one. people around me only pretend to care especially if i’m doing them favors or helping in some way. i am only a placeholder until something better comes along. i hate getting left behind all the time and always being the unimportant one. this makes me suicidal. if i up and disappeared forever it would not matter in the slightest. my life is going nowhere and doesn’t positively impact anyone. i have no idea what to do besides end things. it’s fucking miserable and lonely and i hate this life.

"I've come to realize that if I message nobody first, literally nobody messages me. It just made me realize that nobody really does care at all even after I tried my best to be a decent friend and they just completely forget my existence or reply after a whole day, I don't feel like I'm entitled to a response from them but it'd be really nice. Everyday I just start to care less and less, I've fallen out with most of my real and online friends even after trying to maintain a relationship with them but whats the point if they dont care enough to put in the same effort.  


Stack that on top of personal issues like my mental health and self hatred for myself or problems that my family has to deal with and I just start to lose more hope that it'll really be ""okay"" like everyone says.

Life feels like prison, all the greed, lies, unfairness, crimes etc that plague this earth. This is not normal this is not okay. It’s sucks to see people who lie and is shitty people get rewards regardless of who the people they hurt. Why is that ? You can be an abuser and still get nice things meanwhile innocent people have to suffer. I feel like I was born out of karma for my stupid parents sins. I am not happy at all. Everything is emotionally draining and toxic. I want to snap but don’t have the energy to. All I know is chaos and pain.

"> I don’t know why I was born

I can help with that. You were born because of choices, experiences, and struggles that your parents, and for that matter, your ancestors made, along with those around them. If there was a single different choice, you could have ended up as someone completely different. But you haven't, for a reason.

> Life feels like prison, all the greed, lies, unfairness, crimes etc that plague this earth. This is not normal this is not okay.

Yeah, I've been there. But you gotta remember that humans themselves are animals, and imperfect ones at that. The state of our society has been worse historically - even just a hundred years back - but we've improved quite a bit. Hating humanity for what it is isn't necessarily wrong or bad, but there's not much point in getting bothered by it on large scale; it's just what humans are. If they were different, if they were perfect, if we could do away with all aspects that were bad, we would no longer be human, not in a true sense of it.

But anyway, I'm sorry to hear you're struggling, and I hope things improve for you."	OriginalPerformer580	reply	na	na	na	0.9970867037773132	no	no	no	na	depression
"My bestfriend Sha. She is the person for whom I have cried a lot . The death is better than this friendship .. sometimes I think It had be better if we never met or we never say on same bench.. her actions hurts me so deep .. I am having a fight with my bestfriend, last year we total had 4 fight and those fight last for months or weeks and in this new year I had assured myself that I will not fight with her anymore..and these 7 months I have kept my promise well but in this month I don't know how the fight started like I have didn't done anything.. but still -- 
Sha( my bestfriend) is nice good, but she is jealous type of person she gets jealous often. Recently I have been hanging out with my another friend Hana.. and now she is jealous and she things that's Hana has more importance in my life than her lol can someone explain her  tell her that no you are my importance ... And now it's been a week and she is ignoring me .. she's acting like I am ghost when I am around her..  I know my fault okey I will stop hanging with her but tell me we are not in same grades, we just spend one period with each other that is C.S class.(.so what she things that rest of school time I should ghost myself and not talk to anyone...) She used to reserve seat for me in that period but these day she is not reserving it and she gave my seat to one of the arrogant girl.. and this is what hurts me the most that now I am that low (not deserving) and how can she replace me to the arrogant girl .....and If she hangs out with many of her different friend- I am just allowed to watch not say anything.. I have no right to jealous. But if I am hanging out with any of my friends she has full right to get jealous... 
I am not able to reach out to her these week in school so I contracted her.. (I know I have to contract her very soon but-) but she is acting too cold and that's hurting me soo much.. like while writing these things the tears are dropping out of my eyes.. I asked her to tell what the problem but she didn't reply me anything at first and after a long time she replied me in a arrogant way -
Explain how she didn't like when I am with Hana and she told me in order to if I want to her back I have to stop hanging out with her( I was completely okey with that) and in order if I want her to once again to reserve my seat in C.S. class it is compulsory for me to gave my lunch in the break and that's not a problem but the problem is that she have her lunch with a group and I don't feel good in sitting with them... I don't get a nice vibe and I have tell her about this many times but she didn't never try understand it .....

I'm a few months away from being 30 and I feel like I have made every wrong choice in my life that I could have possibly made. Even the good ones that I have made I feel like I always find a way to screw them up whether through my own incompetence or neglect or just general stupidity. I haven't held down a good job since I was like 18. I end up living paycheck to paycheck which just makes me feel even worse about myself cuz I feel like there's no way that I'm ever going to get ahead cuz I can't save any money. I have no clue why but I'm a habitual liar and I can't seem to stop myself even for stupidest Little things. All I've done is disappoint or hurt all of the people that are close to me and the person that is closest to me my significant other is so sick and tired of the way that I fit it's started to affect her mental health. I want to change but I can't afford the therapy that I know I need and I don't have insurance so I can't even go in and see a doctor to get any prescriptions. I feel like no matter what road I decided to take or what turn I decide to make it all just deeper into this hole. Whenever I start feeling too bad I just find ways to numb myself whether it's drugs or alcohol or porn or anything that makes me stop feeling like s*** even just for the smallest amount of time. I really don't know what I can do and I feel like time is just rushing past me I don't want to end up 40 or 50 year old that still doesn't have a f****** clue. Anytime I start to think about my future I just see blankness. I really just want to change. I want to be different. I want to stop trying to do whatever I can to scramble and make everyone else around me happy and just failing at it miserably. I want to make the people I care about proud and happy, I want to be able to live a normal life, and I want to be able to go through a day without wondering what it would be like if I wasn't born. But I don't know where to start, again I don't have insurance and the paycheck to paycheck so I can't afford to see a doctor or therapist.

"I want it to end. I can’t live like this anymore 

I’m disabled (have been since birth) and come from a poor family. I live in the US so there is little to no help here. 

I’ve applied for SSDI and it will be at least six months before I even get a determination on my case. I’ve called disability attorneys and they won’t work with me until I’m denied. 

Even if I get approved, the amount they give you to live on is laughable. It’s below poverty. 

I’m coming to terms with the fact that the abuse and exploitation I’ve faced my entire life is only going to get worse. If I’m “lucky” enough to live past 50, I’ll likely be set to a care facility.

Most of the time I wish they hadn’t saved me at birth. It’s so hard and it’s just going to get worse until I die in squalor.

I can’t even work from home because my flare ups cause me to be unable to think clearly and cause widespread pain that only rest can ease. Painkillers don’t even work. I don’t even bother getting them filled anymore. 

Right now I’m living in a relative’s spare room that they use for storage. Everything I own is in 2 totes. I’ve already sold everything else. I have a 2000 car that won’t start. I owe money on it.

So first off, I am a 16 year old male living in New Zealand. A couple months ago, I met this girl and we started talking and we talked everyday, we did everything together and she was quickly becoming the best thing to ever happen to me. Then I found out she had a boyfriend and she started talking to me less and I was really sad but then they started having issues again and they broke up and guess who was there to support her. Me. I am always the one helping her and complementing her I just want to feel true happiness. Anyway, we started talking more again and I was fine again until my mother found out about her and my step-dad and her took all my shit, and called the cops on me to kick me out of their house. My mother started telling the girl to not talk to me again but we kept on talking. She said 'it didn't feel right to stop talking to you'. I have no idea what her feelings toward me are, she constantly sends me hearts and we even took each other's virginity but when I ask what I am to her she said 'just a friend'. Now, this clearly devastated me as we did everything a couple would do and I was quite confused. She then moved away overseas, so I can't see her anymore. I got abused by my mum and step-dad, but now I'm living with my dad and step-mom and my dad also abuses me and calls me a loser, etc. I am planning to visit this girl next month in the holidays because she is my world but I'm not sure she feels the same way. I just want to feel loved. No one in my life cares about me, I am overworked at McDonald's, and failing at school. My best friend of 10 years and my only friend just killed themselves and I wasn't there to save her. I am paying for my own food and clothes, etc. I really love this girl but I don't know what to do. I am just a loser who literally no one cares about and I really just want to be loved, as no one in my life ever has. I attempted suicide 5 times in the past 3 weeks, all to no avail. She knows how much I appreciate her, but I don't even know if she wants me to be here. And now she's also talking to me much less and I'm scared she's back with her boyfriend. It is so hard to pretend to be happy everyday, I can't stop breaking down and crying and worrying about everything. I just want to finally be at peace and end it all, not like anyone would care. I want to join my friend. I am trying my hardest but it is just so difficult. I haven't eaten in 4 days and I just don't have an appetite. Without the girl that moved away I feel so empty. So lost. When I tried to tell my mum and step-dad I am not too good, they laughed at me and made fun of me and said I'm just looking for sympathy. There's no point anymore.

"Last night my friend told me that he doesn’t want to be alive anymore.  In the past year or so he has started drinking more and last night he told me that during the winter he was drinking a bottle of tequila alone every night.  Now he just goes to the bar all the time and drunk driving and he has also started chain smoking cigarettes.  He said he started smoking the cigs so they can kill him.

When we talked I could basically tell that he was in an extremely negative spiral and he just doesn’t want to be here anymore.  He says this stems from when he caught his girlfriend cheating on him around a year or 2 ago and he still thinks about it all the time.  He has been filling the void with drugs and drinking and sleeping with random girls from the bar.  

I gave him any advice that I could and let him get the stuff off his chest, but I know that saying all this stuff doesn’t really do much.  I told him he needs to go to therapy too but he kinda just seems to want to vent and not take suggestions, which I understand but I really have no idea what to do about this."	justblu0	post	31.118433245387344	male	White	0.9987061023712158	na	na	na	2	depression
There is nothing you can really do of your own power to help him.  Unfortunately, he is the one making these choices.    If you have the name of a good therapist, hotline, etc, I would give him that.  Tell him you love him and you know he is hurting and you want him to be here.  I would tell him that if he is drunk driving and you know about it, that you are going to call the Police.  Better he get picked up for a DUI which might me the wake up call needed rather than kill an innocent person and/or himself.	justblu0	reply	na	na	na	0.9987061023712158	weak	no	no	na	depression

"I've been depressed for a very long time. I've spoken to over 15+ mental health specialists. Only one of them had any significant impact on me but I relapsed. I only finally got my OCD diagnosis last year. I have been dealing with OCD about as long as I've been depressed and was so ashamed to speak up about it until recently. 

My OCD since seeing a therapist that deals specially with that has been much easier to manage. Not all the time but more than in the past. I really thought the OCD was the main reason I was depressed/anxious but now I don't know. I've always been depressed like I said before but never to the point I had planned my s*icide and actually now I'm ready to take steps to enact it.

I don't have anything to be depressed about really but I hate myself and I hate living. I am aware I have it better than most people in my age group and tax bracket and yet I still hate everything. I feel like a spoiled child. 

The worst part is I can barely maintain my function. I started a new job and for the 8 hours I'm there I get maybe an hour of work down and spend the rest of the time looking busy and doomscrolling on my phone. I struggle to even clean my cats litter trays and feed them which is awful. My partner who I live with doesn't take care of there needs unless I ask him too. (He is a great person he's just tired and sore all the time so he doesn't do much chores either - may be an underlying condition but idk) General cleaning, especially around dishes and laundry I used to be able to get up and just clean but in the past 2 months all I've done is call my parents over to come clean my dishes and I feel like such a loser. 

I don't know why I'm feeling this way. I don't enjoy any hobbies of my anymore, the only thing I look forward to on the weekends and after work is laying on my couch doing nothing. I used to look forward to drawing or playing games on whatever platform and now I just don't care about any of it. I feel so pathetic. I don't even know what I have to be depressed about anymore. I escaped a toxic job, Ive got my own place to live, my current job is great, I have a loving partner and family here to support me. Things are better than they have been for years so why do I think about killing myself all the time.

I just absolutely hate that I cannot for the life of me enjoy anything anymore. I hate that I am still consistently depressed and burnt out after years and years of therapy and managing to somehow stick out and push past some majorly bad shit that's happened. All I right now to cope is eating (Ive gained over 30kgs of weight in the last year because of this) and spending my money on hobbies that look appealing but never actually engaging in them, just fantasising. 

I don't know. Sorry 😔"	shoesandcats	post	29.854928955027873	female	White	0.9993626475334167	na	na	na	1	depression
"Depression & anxiety suck, I'm sorry to hear you're struggling with both (ocd too...). Why do you reckon you hate yourself?

It does sound like you have poor impulse control (food/phone/etc), which... sucks. There are ways you deal w/ it, though, one being by preventing access to food above what you need for basic sustenance on a daily basis. That's just off the top of my mind. Swapping it w/ other things when you're feeling that way can help as well. Personally, music has been quite big for me, gaming, etc, in general, something you enjoy that can distract you/prevent you from reaching for the food, but that isn't too toxic for you."	shoesandcats	reply	na	na	na	0.9993626475334167	strong	no	strong	na	depression

"I tried a new medicine almost 50 days ago, it worked well for awhile, but the truth is I can’t escape this depression, no matter what I do. On top of that my heart is completely broken, cause the person I love don’t love me anymore, I can’t get a job, I lost so much weight (and I’m alreasy very thin). 
Everyday I hope to die, to end this. I can’t take it anymore. it’s like there’s this rope around my neck that pulls me down to the bottom every time I try to get out. I can’t feel happiness, I only cry, I’m a disappointment to my parents, I have no friends. nothing good happens. 
Every damn choice I've made since I turned 18 (ten years ago) has been a failure. I'm a walking failure. a stupid person who doesn't know how to live and doesn't know how to deal with feelings. Yesterday I hurt myself again, felt good for a few minutes.

Okay. This is really complicated. I got into a really abusive/controlling relationship around October 2020, flash forward almost three years later, he took all my money today, our three month old kitten who we just got in June, and right now I’m in a hotel room until tomorrow at 11 am. No where to go. Family shunned and disowned me because they didn’t like him and I ended up turning into a real piece of shit(lying, stealing, acting aggressive, blaming everyone but myself for my problems). So……I have an option that seems to be my only one. I have to check myself into a mental hospital so they can send me to a shelter or something. They actually did that earlier this year for me; there just didn’t happen to be any room in a domestic violence type shelter so I had to stay at Nashville rescue mission. After staying nearly a month there just drinking myself to death, he found me and brought me back to my home town and we ended up getting a hotel together and I grubhubed for a while. I was paying the weekly rate while he just did dope and played on his Xbox. I worked, I cooked, cleaned and did his laundry. I don’t have a car so I would use his car for grubhub and always made sure to treat the car well. He also had a gambli addiction which lead to him taking my money to bet. Flash forward to today. He never changed. He left this morning while I was still asleep . Only left me a text saying i’m bringing him down and it’s my fault that he can’t stop hitting me and putting me down. I know what I have to do, but knowing this will be the fifth time going to a mental hospital is so embarrassing. What should I do?

"I know this has been posted about before regarding how common it is for the depression to set in at night. I can’t pinpoint if it’s also a form of anxiety because the “why” gets me too. 

Some people have reported depression at night because it’s quieter. Often easier to ruminate on things that would typically distract us from our own emotions throughout the day. So people are essentially in their own heads a lot more at night.

Anyone ever feel depressed at night simply because the day is over? And it makes you sad that it’s over? Im not sure what’s going through my head but it seems harder to come to terms with most days.

Not fame, not money, not achievements. Not entertainment, not a family, not even drinks. To be honest, I want my youth back. Since that's impossible, the next best thing will be to get out of here asap. I want to die. No two ways about it. But it's really hard to die without repercussions and this, I believe, is what makes life so unbearable for many of us. There's no way out, but there's no way back either, so we're stuck in this abyss of silent despair. I ran away a few times but came home anyway.

This is a joyous day I have been looking forward to for years and I was maid of honor originally. After my own fiancé/partner of 9 years took his own life this winter weddings have been very triggering for me and my mental health has been extremely unstable. Basically I just spent about a month in the psych ward for depression and PTSD and last minute she told me I was no longer in the wedding due to my instability and chaotic moods. She told me I could still come as a guest. I declined because I could tell my presence would just make her nervous and uncomfortable. I’m not mad at her I understand it’s probably best I don’t go.

"A lot depends on the norms of your relationship and his emotional literacy.  A lot more depends on exactly what you're thinking of telling him.

Honestly, with serious, dark, mental-health issues, friends and family aren't always emotionally equipped to handle disclosure.  It's possible that your fear is well-founded, that maybe first opening up to someone with training might help.  

It's also possible that the fear of opening up is your depression lying to you and the he'll be amazing and wonderful and give you just what you need to move forward along your healing journey.   

It's really, really hard to figure these things out sometimes and I don't know of a way to make it simple.  But it does make sense to me why you're torn, for whatever that's worth.

You're actually the first person on here that thinks the way i do, i just couldn't put it into words at first. I'm bad at putting my thoughts into words, sorry if this text seems weird.

I don't really know what i want him to know, if somebody asked my ""why are you depressed?"" I couldn't even give them a proper reason, even though i know i am depressed and i know reasons why deep down inside me. I think i just want somebody (especially my friend) to really know how I'm feeling, I don't want pitty cause i hate being the center of attention. I know that sounds paradox and stupid, i can't even explain it myself. 

Speaking of opening up to someone with training, i actually had a first conversation/ appointment with a therapist, and for the first time i was able to say i want to speak with her alone, and not with my mom next to me. Because i know I can't tell her the truth when my mom is with me. 
I'm now on a waiting list for a therapist and i hope i get a feedback soon. It feels weird being on such a waiting list, knowing I'm depressed and suicidal while my parents and everyone around me are convinced I'm doing fine.

Again I'm sorry if this text is weird to read/ too long, I'm just dropping my thoughts.

">  if somebody asked my ""why are you depressed?"" I couldn't even give them a proper reason

Well, that's why depression is a mood disorder and not just a mood.  Any mood or emotion that makes sense in the circumstances is not a sign of illness.  

> I think i just want somebody (especially my friend) to really know how I'm feeling, I don't want pitty cause i hate being the center of attention. I know that sounds paradox and stupid, i can't even explain it myself.

Well, that makes perfect psychological sense to me.  We're all sentient social animals and our need for rapport and connection is legitimate and important.  But pity is a sign of [""othering""](https://humanrights.ca/story/us-vs-them-process-othering), i.e. it's the opposite of connection.  

> I'm now on a waiting list for a therapist and i hope i get a feedback soon. 

Me too!  And yeah, I totally get what you're saying about not being free to talk in front of your mom.  Whatever your mom knows will kinda follow you around forever and it's understandable not to want that.  

> I'm depressed and suicidal while my parents and everyone around me are convinced I'm doing fine.

There are a lot more young people in that kind of situation than you might think.  In a perfect world, parents would be the safest people to open up to, but it's not always that way in the real world :(  

> I think opening up to my friend would be a step in the right direction, but I'm afraid of hurting him/ confronting him with something he can't handle. I guess i just have to take the risk of him distancing himself from me.

There's no way to know for sure how that kind of disclosure will strike someone.  But then there's no way to know for sure how any of our choices in life will turn out.  Ofc you know your friend much better than I do, so your guess is likely better than mine, at any rate.  Before you have the conversation with him, it might help you to have some kind of ""Plan B"" in place in case the convo goes sideways.  Are you aware of mental-health crisis resources in your area?

We have the same disease of depression.  But how we got it and how we manage it is different and personal. Some of the basics are mentioned by doctors  because they weed out obvious lifestyle choices that can feed and worsen depression. Poor diet, not enough deep sleep, laziness. Those are kind of first step, try these things before we take it to another level. Trigger points, anger and anxiety management may be next to try. Medication. Therapy. These things may cost you more and may work for some better than others. It can be a life long challenge that may never get fixed. But you can smooth it out over time if you keep trying and trying.

"Hi.  I've struggled with depression all my life, including as a child.  It was my normal state, and I had no clue what NOT being depressed would even look like.   Along with my depression there were other common signs and behaviors that eventually led me into cognitive behavioral therapy when I was 21.  It helped, but the black, sucking undertow was still there, pulling me down.   Until I was in my 40's, there wasn't a single day I didn't think about ways and means and methods to kill myself.  Again, that was my 'normal.'  I saw other therapists through the years, was inpatient for a month, did all the lifestyle changes everyone recommends.  So much of it was helpful, but still ... the black undertow.   I resisted medication, because I was convinced if I just found the right book, the right therapy, the right foods, the right amount of exercise, etc, I could manage it myself.  


In my 40's, I was at the end of the proverbial rope, and knew if I didn't get help I would die.  I could only work part-time and had no medical insurance.  I signed up for a drug company trial on a medication for depression, and after easily qualifying, I started the medication.   Within 4 or 5 weeks it was a HUGE difference.  Colors were brighter, the air seemed lighter, I felt more like the best of myself, and one day, I realized I hadn't thought about my suicide plans in almost a week.   The medication cleared that black sucking undertow -- not completely, but better than I'd ever known.   I finally understood that for some of us, the brain chemical imbalance is core.   I still had to keep working on healing from early childhood abuse, but it's been easier since my depression is managed.  I'm 68 now.   I wish you light and strength on your journey."

"I'm not old, but I am out of my 20s and I feel you. I've been to so many doctors who either blow off what I'm saying or worse tell me how a test works and then tell me everything is fine despite what the test seemed to show. It's like why am I even bothering if all you're going to do is keep coming up with more BS tests and telling me everything is fine? Brought a concern to my last GP about a problem and they literally sat there and talked me out of doing anything about it. 

For the mental health side, I definitely recommend that genetic test, but don't expect a miracle either. Before I lost my insurance, I was on max dosage of 5 or 6 different meds and they were all in the green according to the test. But didn't feel like they were doing anything. 

Until my most recent breakdown, that put me in the hospital, I had other things going that seemed to help. They're not cheap and at least one isn't covered by insurance at all, but it might help anyway. I was going to a chiropractor, had a membership at massage envy, and seeing a therapist. 

Sometimes we get so used to our physical pain, we don't realize it's effecting our mental health. So, the eat right and exercise thing isn't wrong, but if you're already tight and everything is out of place it won't help in the slightest.

Note: find a chiropractor that uses a drop table. They don't sit there and twist everything until you feel like you're gonna break. The drop table is a much more gentle way of getting your body to realign."	Alien_Nicole	reply	na	na	na	0.9993958473205566	weak	strong	no	na	depression

"I'm female, 56, in chronic ever-worsening pain and have been depressed since I was a child. I'm in a really dark place right now so I don't know how helpful I can be, but I would like to try.

In this post you said you felt like if your body would cooperate you could get your life together.  That speaks volumes.  If your doc is not helping you, find another doc.  If that doctor doesn't help, find another.  If a doctor gives you a bullshit answer, find another.  Go to a pain management specialist.  They understand chronic pain better than anyone and are much more likely to prescribe pain pills if that's the solution.  GPs don't want to give them out and if people are in pain and they help, then they need them.

If my pain was the only thing holding me back I would do anything I could to try and deal with it. My pain is just a fun add-on to my depression.

I have had severe, intense lower-back pain in conjunction with major depression and it is a bloody terrible condition. I'll turn 65 in December if that has some bearing on the matter. The major depression has abated over the tears to dysthymia but I still battle the avolitional and anhedonic elements of the condition and the nihilistic apathy or indifference that goes with that.

I’m 60. Was diagnosed bipolar about 15 years ago. Had depression long before that. I have been through probably every SSRI going. Had a genetic test to try and suss out what might be bad for me. Only Wellbutrin showed up as a baddie. Current doctor seems to think all SSRI’s are tipping me into mania, so for the first time I’m taking an anti-psychotic all by itself. It’s a new one, supposed to handle mixed states. We’ll see. Just keep advocating for yourself. Don’t let the bastards get you down. Lol. I wish my kids still needed me.

"I know it feels that way to you. But there are a few people that you will talk to you that don't mean it that way. Most of us have the best intentions for you and everyone that is in the same boat as us. We all just want our mental health to improve. Me personally,  I don't think I will ever reach a state of total peace of mind like the majority of people do. But I do what I can researching my buns off, trying to get even a clue here or there as to what will help my burnt up brain. Some of the wires have been so crossed and connected to the wrong receivers for so long, it's a wonder I'm still around and functioning in this world. Also I will take responsibility for my actions and when I know I'm being depressed or anxious or angry and hateful towards the world, I have to calm down and try, try, try as much as I can to not let my brain continue to ruin things for me. 

Here's one thing I worked on for weeks or maybe months. Whenever I would go down a serious depressed road where I just wanted to die,  I had to tell myself to not do anything to make it worse. Mostly that would be drugs or alcohol or bibge eating junk food until I was sick. Or physically hurting myself. Second to that I had to tell myself to do something that my future self would be happy about. Because I had learned that time passes, and eventually I would get out of that hole and hopefully have a day when the sun was shining on me and I had something to smile and laugh about. So making myself think about the future it was almost like getting out of the funk for a few minutes. Instead of wallowing in the stew forever in that moment, I could see that there would be brighter days if I just looked forward for that brief amount of time."

I left a 3 year relationship a month and a half ago. I don’t think about them no more but what really breaks me down is now being alone. I’m introverted and don’t have a lot of friends. Waking up to no texts , no one to hug , an empty house , etc is really breaking me down. I know that I need to learn to love myself and that it’s okay to be alone. It just sucks. I try to distract myself with work (remote) , walking my dog , martial arts in the evening , etc but these are all just temporary. I am doing better than before but sometimes I just sit down and start crying for being alone in the world and thinking I will never find someone again.  I know it takes time but if possible can you please send some encouragement, personal experience , hope , something to help me believe again for the time being.

"So, you're defeating yourself and need someone to help save you from yourself? There's not much I can do to really convince yourself of your ability to achieve things. When I tell you that you're capable of changing yourself and the world around you, it's entirely up to you whether or not you believe it. 

Life will always be here, and it's brutally indifferent towards us and our suffering. Sometimes life even seems to include people who delight in our suffering, but likewise it will also include people who are happy to see you happy.

If you prevent yourself from trying to achieve your goals, the odds of them being achieved drops to nearly zero percent, but if you keep trying and learn from your past mistakes then the odds go up to nearly 100%. There's a lot of lonely people out there, many with baggage just like yours. Learning to accept others who are broken is one of the best pathways towards learning to accept that which is broken about yourself, and once that acceptance happens, the possibility for change reappears."

"I have no one. I have friends but I cannot rely on them for help, generic uptlifting responses don't do for me. I am hitting rock-bottom. I'm broke, with no prospects of improvement of any kind, I was born under that mental disorder known as being an artist. The only fucking thing I'm good at and the only thing that fills me up a little is the one thing that goes over the board in times of economic crisis, with things as they are now, Who wants anything other than basic stuff? Being a creative is a curse that chains you to a neverending path of suffering. Let's ask professional actresses, actors, singers, comic book artist or animators to see who suffers the most, either by workplace abuse or workplace abuse+other types of abuse.

I've spent my 20s trying to make it as a professional artist (comic book artist and illustrator). 10 years from improvement to studies to neverending failures in the professional industry. On my 30th birthday I decided no more. I would no longer dedicate my life secluded and isolated to drawing and illustrating. Fuck all that. By that point I hated taking a pencil to do anything... I still do. I burned out bad.

Dayjobs or regular jobs they... they tend to destroy me. I don't last on them because my third-world country has a culture of constant abuse and brutality towards workers, I just don't want to be abused and that's a completely valid fear to have.

While leaving behind the professional artist failure of a career I had... I began a crossdressing journey which indeed has improved the way I look at myself, I love myself more but... With no money to have a decent social life and securing basic needs I fail, yet again like my whole failure of a life, to fully develop this side of me. OF and that kind of adult oriented platforms seemed like a good idea at the time but I haven't seen a single penny and I don't have the resources to spam content everyday nor the patience or resilience to endure constant effort that never translates in any reward.

Everyone always says ""just keep going until success happens"" that's a lie. I kept going for 10 years of my life! To no avail!

Who cares if I'm smart, a person of culture who can draw and craft beautiful stuff if the world does not have a place for it to flourish? Those brain-dead tech-bros created AIs just to get rid of us because of their lack of soul. Who cares if I put effort into erotic content when a natural-born women with the worst image-quality available (and lack of image composition knowledge) or a person in full hormone therapy makes thousands? So now I gotta have the fortune to do body-altering procedures I DO NOT WANT to do right now to have a chance?

I do not want to chase likes in social media... I do not want to be millionare, I just want to live a life with dignity, but other than the curse I was born with I have no talent for anything else, except solving logistic problems and organizing people but if you do not have a very specific degree or are the nephew of the industry owner you do not get a chance. My country also does not shine for their, what I call, german-caliber efficiency. For example, when we set a time for a meeting I'm there in time (and time to spare) while everyone else is late while arguing ""it is just the way it is"" fuck people.

6 years single, while meeting a lot of new friends along the way I'm still fucking alone. And as I mentioned I'm... HAPPY about my crossdresing journey, to embrace and know new sides of me but my circumstances and lack of security are so crushing that I wonder if it is ANY reason not to un-live myself...I-I know my text does not make a lot of sense but I'm really stressed and sad.

For more context:

\-I'm in therapy but therapy is not a magic wand. It helps a lot though

\-Gym once a week, HEMA 2 times a week. Good sword-friends there, no love-interest though.

\-Runway once a week

"My (F26) boyfriend (M26) is in a dark place again. I’m not sure what triggers it; his last episode was 5 years ago. (We’ve been together for 8 years). I have pretty bad anxiety problems and so when this happens normally it’s like a crisis for both of us. The episodes last between 2 weeks and a few months. Then they pass and he is back to normal (very loving, warm, fun). Every time he has an episode he tried to leave me then doesn’t. Because of this, when I realize he’s having another episode I get triggered and very scared this will be the time he leaves me for good.

When I try to help him get help, it ends in disaster and I feel like it pushes him even further away. (He says no way to therapy or medicine)

When I ask for reassurance/comfort/affection, it ends badly and I normally feel worse.

When I try to talk to him about it, he gets angry at me and says hurtful things sometimes. 

Last night he told me he wasn’t in love with me and thinks we shouldn’t be together. He later took it back, but I admit, it devastates me and leaves me so insecure. What do I believe? Could it be true?

What is the best course of action? Should I leave him alone? We live together so it’s a little challenging—I’m open to any and all advice/perspectives!

"This is really unfair of him. He shouldn’t be taking his emotions out on you, he needs to learn to identify them for what they are (depressive episode emotions) and deal with them without being emotionally abusive toward you. I don’t really have any advice, because I think he’s the one who’s acting incorrectly. 

When I have depressive episodes I tell my husband so he doesn’t worry about me because I have to withdraw from him a bit so I can deal with _my shit_ without being a bad partner to him. If he can’t do that, maybe he needs to move out to an Airbnb or something while his depressive episodes run their course. But, if his only way with dealing with his depression is to lash out at the people around him, he should probably be in therapy to learn some healthy coping techniques. And you can’t do anything about the way he is choosing to handle his mental health problems. He’ll just use any time you reach out to him as an excuse to hurt you.

The one thing I will say is when he’s in that space, you can’t be reaching out to him for emotional reassurance. He’s not even managing his depressive episodes correctly.

Instead, his depression worsened to bipolar depression, which is way way worse than just depressive disorder. J s y k.	fish321654	reply	na	na	na	0.9778964519500732	no	strong	no	na	depression

"Honestly, probably just leaving him be is the best way to approach it - and I don't mean alone, just not forcing him to talk about it/etc. I understand that that's not... ideal, should I say, and that you want to be there for him, but when he's going through it he seems to be reacting badly to your efforts to reach out for him, so it's hard to say what exactly you could do for him w/o him reacting in such way. What he says when he's like that probably isn't true, I'd reckon, he's just trying to push you away as he likely feels miserable and like he doesn't deserve you. But I'm just guessing based on what you've said.

Anyway, it depends on what the exact cause is of it is because it's unlikely it's happening for no reason. Your best bet is it to approach him about it after he's back to his usual self, to talk w/ him about it and find ways to be there for him + explain to him how it makes you feel when he pushes you away, because it doesn't seem like it's likely you'll be able to do so currently."	fish321654	reply	na	na	na	0.9778964519500732	weak	no	no	na	depression

"Some questions: Looking back to the episode five years ago, what things you have done turned out to be big mistakes? What helped you during this time? What were a good support for you? Do you know, how this episode of depression ended? 
I think, if you have at least some answers, this could be starting point for you.

Additionally: Who else can support you, when you‘re going to support your friend? Make sure, you get some people to talk about your feelings and sorrows especially in this time. Also get out sometimes with friends, do something for yourself and let your bf alone in bed (not when he needs you that much, but there will be some days, where he might just doing nothing and can distract himself well via medias without your attention). Even when he‘s in a harsh situation, you still have your needs. If he wants more and has difficulties to respect it or feels to ask for too much, he should consider professionals. 
And here I see the real problem: Why won‘t he go to therapy or takes medics? It‘s a serious, destructive and in some cases indirectly deadly mental illness. As long as he does not understand it or is not willing or able to recognize and accept it, there is not much you can do.

"I’m in this photo and I don’t like it.

I too, push my girlfriend away. Recently I went unemployed for 2 months while in a depressive episode, yet now, I’m in a better position than I’ve ever been looking at making $70k per year in a low cost of living city with great benefits…the first good job I’ve ever had. 

I don’t even mean to harp on my successes. My point in saying that is that his depression is most likely just that: depression.

Men with depression seem to be a different kind of beast, and maybe I’m biased, but I’m just going to talk.

I’m just saying that my upbringing had definitely taught me to not only bottle my emotions, but also reject emotional contact from outside sources. So whenever I’m feeling depressed, I think those coping mechanisms only get worse.

I’m fact, I experience depression as this:

My emotions of sadness, fear, pain, etc are so intense that I don’t even give them consideration anymore. I try to simply ignore them or fill the void with some good old Mary Jane or coke or alcohol or what have you (I’ve grown out of the coke as of recent but just want to paint a picture).

The thing is that a drug can physically force an emotion.

When I’m depressed and sober? I feel nothing. I say nothing. I avoid conflict. I want to be left alone and to my own devices, which is crazy because I even hate my own company. 

My girlfriend suffers so terribly bad, every god damn time.

And you know what? I get a bit angry that she’s mad.

It seems ridiculous, right? Like she only wants to help! But son of a bitch, here I am acting like a no-good asshole and now she’s suffering from the sadness and anger I feel inherently. And boy, that doesn’t help anything. 

It doesn’t help me feel any better whenever I’m down and I’m constantly reminded that I’m down and it’s dragging the one thing I care about in this world into the depths with me.

I’m just painting a picture of my own life experience, I’m certainly not trying to make you feel any type of way about your relationship.

I say my spiel to ultimately say this:
Depression sucks, and unfortunately there is no good cure. I understand why your boyfriend doesn’t want to take meds, because I don’t either. When I feel normal, I would never want to change myself or the way I perceive myself. I want to be authentically me. The multiple prescriptions of drugs you’ll take that affect you receptors and tell them how to feel? They’ll make you feel fake. They’ll force you to be happy when you aren’t even in a position to be happy.

It’s not something I want. I want to fight it by myself. In fact, I feel like depression and self-loathing was felt multiples upon multiple times many generations before us. How do we handle it?

Idk.

Just accept and move forward. Your boyfriend ultimately needs your support, not your concern for yourself. 

And it’s not easy. You can make the choice from here. Does he deserve it? Do you love him enough to suffer through a couple months without any kind of gratification?"	fish321654	reply	na	na	na	0.9778964519500732	no	strong	no	na	depression
"the most important thing to keep in mind is this: it will pass. 

sometimes it helps looking at depression the same as the flu. you get sick, lay in bed all day eating soup (if anything at all), you sleep a lot and you heal. what you need is time, love, good nutrition, lots of water and sleep. 

it's really not that different with depression. the episode starts and you fall into that pit, you don't have nearly as much energy as you normally would, and you neglect things and people including yourself. what you need is, again, time, love, continuous food intake, good hydration and rest. by rest I don't necessarily mean sleep, I mean doing things in energy saving mode, not overdoing yourself etc. taking breaks. 

so here's what I wish my partner to do, have or give me when I'm going through depressive episodes like that: understanding of what I'm going through, reassurance that they will stay and support me, stamina to push through these times with me (because depression doesn't just affect the depressed, it absolutely affects those around as well), but what I sometimes need most is space. 

space isn't just being left alone all day. space can be cuddling, but absolutely not talking. 

space can be doing things together, but not ""having to express"" any feelings. when I'm going through depressions it's hard for me to showy partner I love them. partly because it's really hard for me to show emotions at all during those times (except of course the negative ones, thanks brain), but mostly it's because going through depression takes aways all my positive emotions and feelings almost entirely, locks them out, I can't feel it, and that includes love. I've often misinterpreted my depression as ""I don't love this person"". and then feeling like you're expected to still show them love is the hardest thing. that's why sometimes, I have to trust the relationship as a whole, instead of felt emotions and spoken words. 

space can even be laying in bed all day, be taken care of with drinks, food, cuddles every now and again, watching films and series or listening to music and just relax there all day, alone, together, doesn't really matter. 

what's generally important is both of you knowing what you have together, and trusting this depressive episode will not damage that. both of you need to be able to distinguish between partner and disorder/illness. so for example if your partner says they don't love you, try to see that your partner would never say that. it's the depression talking, basically. 

idk how well your understanding of depression is, but I definitely recommend reading into it. understanding your partner's illness is I think the biggest factor playing into your ability to help and support.  

I with you both the best <3 don't overwork yourself, though. what I've said above partly applies to other disorder and illnesses as well, and could be of use for you with your anxiety, too. remember: if you're burnt out and down, you can't help and support your partner at all. talk to them if things get too difficult for you and take a step back if you need to."	fish321654	reply	na	na	na	0.9778964519500732	weak	no	no	na	depression
"I have had a major depression and persistent depression (two different types) at the same time and it is horrendous.
In my experience, it is unhelpful to push ‘therapy’ on someone in that state. You have to wait until they are ready, or you will be pushing them away.
You need your own support system so that you can be his. Quiet support is best, encouraging him gently to join you for meals, giving him cuddles in bed for a moment or two. Not too long. But often. Sending him funny things you find on the internet or cute photos. But don’t expect any response.
When the depression starts to lift he will come back to you because you’ve been there throughout, quietly reminding him that you still love him and think about him.
Avoid confrontation, avoid asking him to do anything, he doesn’t have the mental or physical energy for it and it will feed his ideas that you don’t care about him and that he is useless.

"I feel like asking him to refrain from saying *every* thought that pops up in his head about your relationship/you particularly durning his depessive episodes. Since he refuses to seek professional help, it's the bare *minimum* he can do - just stop sayings *every* thought that he has out loud. This is to protect you from anxiety he causes by saying every thought that crosses his mind making you (understandably) emotional. He doesn't need to try to suppress, or not have, the thoughts he has during these episodes (it's very common to have intrusive/destructive thoughts during these periods) just to not verbalize all of them. 

As far as what you can do, you can keep in mind that when he's in one of his depessive states that he's not actually in his ""right mind"". It's the lack of neurotransmitters in his brain causing him to be in this state and many (sometimes all) of the thoughts he has during this period are going to be skewed.

A big part of why I started telling my husband “hey, the depresh is hitting pretty hard” is because he would see me withdraw and become anxious it was about him. He’d then start needing emotional support from me at a time where I needed the emotional support and had little or none to spare for him. And it’s too much. I never treated him the way your boyfriend is treating you, but I would resent him for not letting me look after myself when I needed to be doing it the most. I’d have to basically hit pause on my feelings anytime he needed me, which then extended my depressive episode because I was never able to take the time I needed to actually work through it.

At the college I attended, if you fail a class 3 times, you're out. That was my case with physiology. Funny enough, I was loving all that I was learning, but during testsI would crash and fail. During my third time I failed but we are given 2 tests as a chance to pass. The first is an extraordinary test and the second a special one. I took the Special one a couple of days ago and I failed. I had nothing else planned. I don't know what to do. I haven't been taking my depression medication thinking I was going to pass. After months of study, I was almost certain. I don't know what to do to keep the dark ideas from coming in to my mind and corrupting my sanity. I feel like an idiot, a failure and an embarrassment. I don't know what to hold on to.

Well for starters, start taking your antidepressants again. Secondly, I failed college twice and my therapist told me to look at it as a learning experience. Now you know what you're getting into and you'll be better prepared for it the second time around. There's no law saying that if you fail you have to give up. Try again.

"The first thing you should do is to consult your psychiatrist and get a re-evaluation. Symptoms of depression evolve and you said you discontinued taking your meds so instead of resuming them again on your own, it is better to ask your doctor if you should continue with the same meds. 
Secondly , please know that this is not the end. You are capable of doing so many things in life. If you failed a few times , it does not mean that you are a hopeless failure. Sometimes God has a different plan for us and we only have to look closer. I know it is not easy to feel positive at this time but trust me , anything which is constant is change. Things do get better and time does not remain the same. You can still do a lot. Take your failures as a lesson and work even harder to achieve your goals. 
Thirdly , I would suggest finding a group of friends who have the same course of studies like yours and you can conduct group studies with them. It is not only healthy but is also a fun activity to do. That way you won’t feel alone during your journey and you will have people around you working for the same goal. It is motivating.

"Is there any way you can get accommodations at your school? Your experience of loving what you’re learning but crashing during tests sounds a lot like mine (dx with ADHD, anxiety, and depression). It sounds like you’re having seriously debilitating mental health struggles and you should speak with a psychiatrist and figure out a plan to get back on your medication or try a new medication. It is possible that the academic outcome was impacted by your untreated mental health struggles. If you and your psychiatrist can make a case for that, maybe you could appeal? Worst thing that could happen is your school says no.

Regardless, the most important thing is your health, and getting the support to treat your depression, because leaving those struggles unchecked will be a hurdle to any career path (and, more importantly, your happiness). You are not a failure. You are playing a game with the cards stacked against you, and you’re still playing, which is a feat in itself. Please try to treat yourself with compassion. Just because you don’t see a clear path yet doesn’t mean there aren’t any worthy trails. It just means they aren’t visible yet.

firstly sorry for my bad english. So I have a question. But first I should explain my situation. So  in all honestly I sometimes do self harm, I don’t know why exactly I am doing it. I feel just so low in some moments and it helps me to stay calm and feel better. So I do ask myself if I would need some help and should go to therapy. But on the other Hand I do not want anyone to know. This is also why I am writing on an anonymous website to people I do not know personal . I also feel that I would overreact if I would go therapy, not that I am person who does not believe in therapy! I do believe it is really Important and helpful for people and would suggest it to everyone. But I also think that i dont need it enough and That my Problems are not big enough. So my question is, when would you go to therapy? I really needed to get these thoughts out of my Head and I hope I dont annoy anyone with this post.

"Hi,  


It sounds like you already know the benefits of talking to a professional about this, but two things might be holding you back.

1. First, no things are too small to talk about and get help with. People go to therapy for all kinds of things, and therapists are used to hearing all kinds of problems. Self-harm due to negative thoughts and feelings definitely falls within the category that a professional can help with. I would suggest you find someone with either a specialty in either ACT or CBT.
2. It's understandable that sharing such a thing will require you to be partly vulnerable, and share some things. But therapists are very open to go at the pace you are ready for. Maybe the first session you don't feel comfortable sharing everything about the self-harm and just talk about the negative thoughts - and that's fine! Take it at your own pace

i've been officially diagnosed with MDD, GAD, and PTSD for the past 2-3 years. throughout these past 3 years i have spent so much time just trying to find a medication that can work for me. i've taken zoloft, lexapro, prozac, wellbutrin, pristiq, and a few others and none have gotten rid of my depressive episodes. these episodes just hit me like a wall. it's gotten to the point where i'm scared I might do something reckless. i was diagnosed after i had overdosed and was hospitalized. it was the most traumatic experience of my life and i still have nightmares and anxiety about it. my biggest fear is letting that happen again. i am trying so hard to distract myself and think about the good things in life but it is like my mind is uncontrollable. i am currently on 100mg of Pristiq and 300mg of Wellbutrin and have been experiencing some side effects from the Pristiq. i'm hoping that by venting i can clear my head and distract myself, i do not know what else to do.

"18f. So I've been struggling with depression for a long while. At least since I was like 11. That aside. I can't seem to get happy for my boyfriend. I love him to bits and wish I could be better for him. I hate that he has to deal with a sad hollow husk of something i used to be. We've been in a relationship for about 5 years now, but it's a long distance relationship. He's from the UK, I'm from the US. But anyway. He tries so hard to get me to be happy. It useally works... Only for a few hours though at most. I could be on call with him and have the time of my life. But I always get sad again. I struggle a lot with suicidal idealation and have hurt myself in the past. I know it hurts him to see him suffer. How can I stop being so damn miserable and just be happy?

I've tried taking antidepressants in the past... I took Lexapro, and it didn't work. It just flattened me out and made me like a zombie. I don't wanna play pill roulette or have to rely on them but I don't seem to be getting better. I'll have months where I get worse, but some where I'm a little better. I'm around 230 pounds but I've been trying to make a small effort to change that, drinking more water, waking 5k-10k steps a day, trying to improve my eating. I wanna get more into exercising but I've been having a hard enough time as it is. I want to improve but I don't want to have to go to therapy or anything.

"First of all, as you mentioned, using chemical pills is the least favorable option. Without them, it's possible that by shifting your mindset, you can alter not only your own situation but also that of your friend. However, when your brain is influenced chemically by any form of medication, the initial step is to discontinue its use. Remaining under their influence prevents true mental healing.  
  
But how can you gradually stop using them? It's not about quitting all at once or immediately. Instead, it involves replacing a bad habit with a good one over time. We can genuinely contribute to the happiness of others only when we ourselves are truly content. Merely putting on a smile outwardly for the sake of others' satisfaction and happiness, while internally burdened and depressed, doesn't resolve their issues or our own.  
  
It's a fact that no one but ourselves can truly aid us. The solutions are within our grasp; we must take action and persist, gradually but consistently.  
  
Begin with an activity you genuinely enjoy, such as creating art, attending a class, or learning new software—whatever you're committed to pursuing. Wake up with anticipation for it, and work towards making that day fulfilling.  
  
However, I emphasize that the primary step is to rid your body of chemical drugs, using whatever means possible.

Yeah both of them said that in the first ten minutes. Never asked how long and why I was on this cocktail of drugs that has been building for 20 years. They didn’t even submit a report to my GP. He was going to ring the psychiatrist and give him a serve, but I said forget it. I’m done. I never thought I’d end up as one of those ""too hard"" cases. Yet, that’s where I’m at."

"Newton's third law of motion states, ""for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction"". 

When you apply this to emotion, it should mean that whatever negative emotion you're feeling, at any intensity, you are capable of feeling at least equal to that in positive emotion. Whether it's pain, sadness, isolation. You are capable of feeling compassion, joy and a sense of wholeness - at the same intensity.

I am at a time in my life where I am truly striving for inner peace. I fought the demons of my past and I have absolutely obliterated them, with empathy. Now I know that its possible to create compassion equal to my pain.
I hope I can continue this progress of personal inner growth, and help as many people as I can along the way. The only thing that disturbs my peace now, is the nagging feeling that I should share it. 

My way of thinking is there were many times in my life that I felt stuck a certain way or with a certain habit. In some sort of negative cycle in life, making some mistake or other. It was a void that boyfriends and money and holidays and anything else materialistic, never seemed to fill. 
I had children and I thought they filled it, but I realised again I was in a period of adjusting and started becoming complacent. I went through a stressful and painful period in life, and my sense of self took a really hard hit. I felt lost and insignificant in the world. A lesson in humility most of all. A reminder of how fragile a state of mind can be when it's been built on weak foundations. 

As it stands today, with yet more bad news, life is not showing signs of letting up any time soon. I am a firm believer, that when life pushes you push back harder, in YOUR way. Life is not going to stop picking on you, until you give it a reason not to. 

Give yourself a pat on the back if you point blank refuse to be everything thats wrong with the world today, but it's not enough. To achieve balance we need to actively strive to be the good in the world, however that looks in your own life. You should learn how to really listen to yourself. To do what you think is right, in your gut, and you know it. 

Every answer of how you should respond to a situation is inside you. Under all the bad habits and behaviours and addictions and coping strategies, you didn't stop to realise you're not even the person who needed that stuff any more! 

You are a totally different person now!

With serious knowledge and capabilities! You are equipped with the things you need to navigate life, and all the rest of this crap you carry round in your head, all these lies you tell yourself are just to keep you in your place. The place that says you are defined by the worst moments of your life. That you will/can only go as far as your trauma allows. Even though, deep down you know you're capable of more. You know you're capable of enormous amounts of love, compassion, bravery. Of thinking rationally, tactically. You know you are capable of being calculated, manipulative and how to inflict emotional harm, but you choose every day not to. 
You make good choices most of the time now. You are a good judge of character. When you speak, people listen. There are things in life that only you can give people, because that is what you are to them. You are here to fulfil a purpose in someone's life in some way, and them in yours. However long it takes to fulfil that purpose, you are here for it. 

You know this because you feel instinctively, at your core, that you have been here before. You are more than this life, you are your soul. What is your soul here to overcome? What will you use to overcome it? 
But overcoming it is non-negotiable. 

Your soul won't run out of energy. Your ""spirit"" can't be broken. We can't comprehend the complexities of what a human soul is. I do know, without a doubt, that I have been here before and lived another life. So why, when I believe all of this, would I ever choose to torture such a thing? 

Every bad habit you learn in this lifetime can be unlearned. You started those behaviours or thinking patterns at a time where they served a purpose. You were vulnerable in some way, that was your response at that time. As time goes on this issue has become an automatic response. Here, we have a strong, capable, intelligent, loving and hyper-aware soul, living in a body full of behaviours that don't match up with who they are now. 
If we can see ourselves this way, we can see others this way. People who are stuck or lost, wandering aimlessly. People who have lost touch with their inner knowing, or deny its existence. 

No matter what your issue is, you don't need it any more. It is nothing but a symptom of a problem that no longer exists. Its time to stop being sentimental. Time to take control, and get off this train. Time to admit you know that you are more. To admit you know you have a purpose here, and that you are still learning it. 

You can get back on the right track at any point in life. There is nothing you can't come back from. You can be in the present moment, embracing everything you are now. Everything you've learned, all the good you do. You can see your pain, match it with equal compassion, and free yourself with understanding. 
Going where feels right, acknowledging the people you are drawn to, and accepting however that ends up. You are more than the things that have happened to you, you are more than the mistakes you've made. You know this, deep down. You are more than this life. You are your soul. 

Going forward in the world one step at a time, but now with intention in every step. 
Knowing you are a glowing light in the world, here for a purpose."	FabulousDefinition29	reply	na	na	na	0.9994033575057983	no	no	no	na	depression

All my friends abandoned me, I made mistakes, very simple ones, I apologized and they somehow think I'm the devil or something even though they say way worse things. My friends are gone, my family couldn't give less of a shit about me. Nobody can stand me and I don't know why I never yell I try to be polite, sometimes I'm crude but it's never that bad. I was alone before for over a year and a half. I can't do that again. I don't know how I did that before without killing myself after the first few months. I'm so alone and nobody cares. My anxiety is coming back and it feels worse. My parents yell at me for just asking questions or eating when they wanted me to eat later. 

I'm only 15 I don't think I can do this for another year unless somebody else does something to help. I've already tried getting help and nobody cares enough to do anything. Everyone around me can't stand me when I just try to be myself. I know I'll end up dying soon or I'll do something drastic but even if I do nobody's going to care. I should kms

"For the last 3 months by the recommendation of my doctor I started adding Effexor to Wellbutrin xl (150mg) which I have been on for 2 months prior. I started at 75 then 150 in the first month then 255mg for the next two. when I added Effexor to Wellbutrin I became more sleepy, lower energy, completely unmotivated (almost bedridden) compared to my usual (which is pretty bad to begin with)  
  
  
  
I thought it would go away with time but it didn't so when I completed my 3 months ""trail"" on Effexor about 3 weeks ago I started lowering my dose from 225 to 150 to 75 and by yesterday I began 37.5 and I plan to stop completely within 2 weeks (thankfully I didn't experience most of the horrible withdrawal symptoms that I read about online before starting but I start having vertigo and pressure around my eyes when I lowered my dose to 75 and I still have them but I hope they go away with time)  
  
  
  
tomorrow I have an appointment with my doctor and I don't know what to do or what ask for? I am pretty desperate at this point. I really though the Wellbutrin + Effexor combo would work for me. I had severe depression for the last 12 years and spikes of anxiety periodically whenever I feel like nothing can get me out of this mess. until now nothing did work for me apart from numbing me to a point where I don't feel as much (metaphorical) pain and despite as I usually do. I am 30 years old now and I don't know what else I should try? is there something else to try before I lose hope about my situation?  
  
  
  
In the last 12 years I tried: Lexapro, Brintellix, Prozac, Cymbalta, Zoloft, Wellbutrin XL, Effexor XR, Pristiq, Abilify, Seroquel, Lamictal, Concerta (low dose, briefly). and when I have severe anxiety episode I take Ativan 1mg

"The word ""miracle"" (Mo-Je-Ze) in Arabic comes from the root ""A-J-Z"". This word shows a state when a person feels unable to survive under the pressure of problems, since he is under severe pressure. It is at that time that, if they are religious, they look for miracles and openings in the heavens. If they are not religious, they search on earth through their own efforts or appeal to others.  
  
In both cases, the cause of the pressure is one thing: ""our growth, in the long run.""  
  
As a tangible example, consider the gym and bodybuilding. The heavy weight given by the coach is such that it is neither easy for you nor destructive. Instead, it forces you to shout from beneath it and continue.  
  
The goal of the trainer is not to hurt you, punish you, or be stubborn with you, but the weight's pressure will hurt and challenge you for a while. The good news is that this pain itself will soon subside. Ultimately, it leads to growth and excellence.  
  
So, don't worry about the dark nights of life, and don't complain about your destiny or God, etc., during hardships. Just shout like a Man and move forward through the pain until the sun shines in your life again, and your circumstances are better than before.

"I relate to this. Last year when I was  22 I was working full time and going to college full time. I think the burn out I was experiencing sent me into the worst depression I had so far. I was crying uncontrollably at random times throughout the week and had lack of sleep in general. Especially around finals in December and my was in December. I was so drained I did nothing on my bday. I also used to enjoy art too (painting) but I couldn’t bring myself to do anything outside of going to work, school and trying to sleep. For a while I lost hope for the future and didn’t care about it anymore. I kept wishing i would die from being hit by a car while on my way to work or school and even started fixating on what would be the easiest way to off myself. Also I was extremely stressed about the future because I didn’t have an internship in my major and I was so worried about graduating with no job in my field and being stuck with the one I hated that I got into just to help me pay for school. 

I deff felt like I was just existing to work. Literally everything I did felt like a chore. Over eating became a coping mechanism since eating was the only thing I briefly enjoyed. I ended up gaining 40lbs in like 5-6 months it was insane for me because I never experience weight gain like that. 

I finally graduated in May this year and I do feel better not having all of that of my plate anymore and actually getting a job in my field so I’m not stressed about that anymore either. However, I’m still working through finding enjoyment in life I think it may take some time because that was my life for 2 years straight ( I did summer and winter classes to graduate faster). On the bright side I’m sleeping better and I’ve been eating more healthy since march, so far I’ve lost 22lbs. 

I’m sorry this is long but all this to say: I get how you feel and I believe things do get better it just takes time. Only do what you can do and eventually circumstances will change and existing will feel a little easier. I see you also are working and going to school are you feeling overly exhausted from it?"

Yes it sounds like you are under a lot of pressure and your days are filled with things you have to do and you have very little free time. It will get better eventually, for me I knew I would be suffering at least until after I graduated. To be honest, I think you should tell your mom a little about how you feel. There may be ways she can help you out and venting does help some too, like what you are doing on here! Deff don’t tell her you want to die because I think that would crush any parent and that might be more than you’d want her to know Anyways. But maybe tell her you haven’t been feeling like yourself lately or something you feel comfortable with telling her!

Hey. So I've struggled with depression for a long time but this is probably the worst it's been. A few months ago I was feeling like I was starting to manage it but I'm slipping hard again. I was drinking water everyday, down to one cup of coffee a day, eating the way I should be and not spending so much time in my room. Lately I've been doing quite the opposite of all that. I feel like my soul is hurting and it's bleeding into my person in the form of numbness. I think when I was younger I distanced myself from my emotions, I was bullied a lot and grew up in a home with yelling, manipulation, and general disregard for other peoples emotions, so losing them seemed like the best option to keep from getting hurt. Nowadays I feel like I've been doing that so long that I'm close to completely emotionally shutting down; and it's almost scary. I go through the day not feeling much of anything, I'm not as empathetic as I used to be, and not to sound selfish but I can't even imagine anyone having it worse than me, even though I know that there are people that have it much much worse. Part of the reason for that I think is because I spent my life comforting other people and not receiving the amount of comfort I needed. I don't wanna rant too long here so I guess I'll end it with asking for any sort of advice. I'm just looking for ways I can try to improve my overall mindset. I don't have much energy and I hate to say it but I feel like nothings going to help so I often don't try to find anything. But anything that might help is appreciated, thnx for listening.	canyoucallmemilk	post	20.69744266622368	male	White	0.9981027245521545	na	na	na	1	depression

"Trigger warning I guess idek

I've been struggling with depression for a long time, I think since I was around 7 or 8. I don't have it that bad, but I was sexually abused by several male family members at different points in my life. I suffered through poverty, but we are slowly healing and I'll leave it at that. 

A few years as this goes on, my father (main abuser) finally gets arrested. I go on anti depressants. They work for a month or two. 

They stop working. 

I've been on medication for 2 years, and I take 50mg anti depressants. I do not know what to do. I do not think they will up my dosage, or if that will even help. I was diagnosed with depression, but none of the help they give me works. Nothing ever works. 

I'm angry. I'm tired. I blow up at people for no reason. I ruin relationships. I make life harder for my parents because of how difficult I am. 

I'm unsure on what I should do, because the only thing I want to do is just give up, even though I cannot. Are there different routes than medication that can be approved by a therapist? Do they even work? 

I would appreciate any support or advice given to me. Thank you for anyone reading. Apologies if you cannot give correct advice due to the rules of this subreddit, but I would appreciate anything you could say. 

Sorry if this does not make sense. Will clarify further if needed."	Master_Candidate5967	post	25.24256581927265	female	White	0.9948370456695557	na	na	na	2	depression
It sounds like you may need a med adjustment, and possibly a new therapist.  Ask your mom to get you an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible to see about the meds.	Master_Candidate5967	reply	na	na	na	0.9948370456695557	no	no	no	na	depression

I’m fed up with life. I’m sick of having to conform to the standards of society and then being punished when I don’t do so and im not talking about conforming to friend groups. Im sick of everything. Im sick that you are expected to work a 9 to 5 job five days a week doing some that you potentially don’t even really wanna be doing just to pay for billing that you never asked to pay for just to live. Rent, water, electric, car insurance and car payment all of these things society has created that you never asked to pay for but still need to live. Cuz you can live without a place to stay, you need a car to get back and forth from your job to pay your rent. I’m sick of it all and then there are the laws that force you to be a npc. God forbid you accidentally go above the speed limit while driving and if you do here’s a fine you have to pay for that you already can’t afford to pay and then next thing you know sense you can’t afford it then are now threatening to place a warrant for you arrest if you don’t but i already can’t pay it and then there’s the laws surrounding drugs. How’s come I can’t enjoy weed or I’ll be fined and the same case with the speeding ticket but we can drink alcohol die of liver disease later in life..this is why people are depressed. Humans were never met to sit behind a desk and work five days a week to pay for shit they don’t really need or flip burgers and stress about how they can take care of there families none of this is natural but we are forced to deal with it and conform regardless	Intrustive-ridden	post	23.635301741526597	female	White	0.9978417158126831	na	na	na	3	depression

     I am a 19 year old about to start my 3rd semester of university. Over the summer break, I moved to my college town (for financial reasons), leaving my friends and family behind. I have never been so lonely in my life. All I do is work and rot in bed when I get home. I've lost 30lbs. I'm a 6'2 man that weighs 170lbs. I look like shit all the time. I used to have hobbies. I would write music. Draw. Read books. Now I don't have the energy for any of that. I threw away everything I knew, and now I live in a shithole apartment that costs $1300/month and I'm not even allowed to have a cat. The semester starts in a week and I'm hoping that the human contact will get me out of this slump. It's a been a brutal part of my life, but maybe the light is at the end of this long ass tunnel.

"Wow, I could’ve written this myself, down to the $1,300/mo shithole apartment. My semester also starts in a week, and I (21F) don’t know how I’ll muster the energy to be a functional person by then.

I think there’s a lot of us rotting in our apartments without friends or a tether to the world. But we don’t see them, because the rotting happens behind closed doors. Most of what we see in public are the glimpses of what we should be: sociable, happy people with well-maintained appearances and a zest for life. I don’t know how to relate to them. Appearances can be deceiving, but I’m fairly sure my depression is written all over my face, because it’s made me underweight and exhausted. Most days I’m just looking for someone to say: “I see you, and I’m proud of you for enduring this.”

I may be fool, but I do hope that things get better for both of us. Even if the bags under our eyes take months to fade, we will run through that tunnel and find a happier place.

Every joy in my life is being told to FUCK OFF
Nothing is sacred to the screams of FUCK OFF
Excuse me while I release my insecurities, and don't tell me to FUCK OFF
Oh, excuse me while I open up my heart to someone for the first time and they tell me to FUCK OFF
Well I'm tired of waiting under my turtle shell for my episodes of depression the only emotion I'm allowed to feel, to FUCK OFF
I know that I have a lot to be happy about but those things are being screamed at to FUCK OFF
Why is it that of all the things that are happening in my shitty life, depression has to be added telling everyone and everything to FUCK OFF
Oh, your one of those people that has the luxury of saying that I am not a part of my illness, my illness is a part of me well guess what, FUCK OFF
I'm tired of these fake ass stories of people becoming amazing individuals while I'm still being screamed at to FUCK OFF
My brain should hold the place where I feel that I can run to, not the place where I need to run from but that idea is another that is being told to FUCK OFF
I've been trying to scramble for a breath of air to find that little bit of self confidence and esteem so that when I yell back to FUCK OFF
It hears my pleas, that small morsel of hope that i was fed this week didn't keep me satisfied for more than two days it was told to FUCK OFF
Everything in my life is crashing down on top of the sawdust strong pleas of my existence, while my thoughts of me becoming something worthwhile run so fast that when my brain tells them to FUCK OFF

Stop trying to save me, I've felt like this forever, i give up, just let it take me, and as you stare at me bleary-eyed I spat at you FUCK OFF
But now that it's consumed my existence, it's decided to FUCK OFF
Cause apparently I'm not worth the goddamn effort it took to feed off of my existence so that you could really claim my body so I could tell others happiness to FUCK OFF
Well, you keep on thinking that, cause I know that as soon as I have a single morsel of something that you can make destroy me you are going to go right back at it and yell at me to FUCK OFF

Crying out for help in my shaking
Shaking off the shackles of my exterior

Hear all the truth in a song that is so me that I am obsessing
Obsessing on and stressing all the little things
Things are getting better in my life
Life is a slow burning fuse towards a great escape
Escape from the fire that is constantly burning
Burning up every piece of self esteem and happy
Happy a word that is cursed to never correlate with me, myself, and I
I am at a loss for emotions most the time a walking talking corpse of myself years before
Before you go and ask me what's wrong notice the emphasis on I when I say I don't know
Know that yes I realize that this is a normal thing to feel sometimes, but not forever, but even if I open up to you you'll just try and downplay it while blaming it on things that I want to change so that it's not something for darkness to clutch onto but you decide to give more strength, glad that makes you comfortable and I continue to wonder if I can make a living.

I am F15. Recently, i have been feeling so depressed that i feel like cancelling on my best friends when we hang out. Its the summer and im going into sophomore year, im scared im going to fail. I cried for the first time in 5 months (not by choice, i physical couldnt cry which made me feel worse) at some points i forgot why i was crying and i was just bawling my eyes out, and i had plenty of reasons to cry but i just didnt. One of my best friends blocked me, i was dealing with abuse from family, and teenage romance wasnt going in my favor for multiple occasions. I used to suffer from anxiety in 6th,7th, and half of 8th grade but i got over it but now i feel even worse than before. Ive never felt so low. Ive been struggling to cook for my disabled mom and I, ive been struggling to keep my house in order, and ive been down for no reason. I dont want to go into sophomore year depressed and unmotivated.

"when i was around your age i joined a therapy youth group that helped me loads. if things with your current friends aren’t going well maybe you can find support elsewhere so you don’t feel as alone and rejected. try researching mental health centers in your area. maybe also in community centers, even churches (often they host things completely unrelated to religion, like AA and the like). 

you could also find something unrelated that will be host to like minded people. pick a hobby and look for summer events held in your area relating to it. i think a good person to ask about all of this will be your local librarian. 

considering your situation, you could also find a support group specific to that (having a disabled person in your care). i hope this helps even if it inspires you to do something completely different. be well ❤️"	Specialist_Dog_9092	reply	na	na	na	0.9987001419067383	weak	strong	no	na	depression

I recently had a big fight with my dad, it made me realise that he loves me, because I'm his son, but he doesn't like me. He doesn't like me in person, he just has to love me because we're family. I don't think the rest of the family likes me either. I cannot talk to them about anything because it's always like I am talking to a stranger. So Alward and as if I'm not in the right place. With others I do not feel like, nor loved. I don't think anyone loves me or will ever be able to. I think the only way to get happy for brief moments again is to be in a relationship but if noone loves me that's  gon be hard.

I’m not sure how to handle this.. I have anxiety and seeing him this way just breaks my heart. I can tell he’s always thinking about something, or sad about something.. I’m in therapy and definitely feel therapy would be beneficial to him but I know not to throw that at him. I’ve mentioned it before and he declined so I don’t want to make his situation worse by asking so much. I’m a fight and he’s a flight kind of person.. So this is very difficult for me. I try to be as supportive as I can but there’s so many rules to how you speak to someone with depression about their depression and I don’t want to make the wrong move or make him feel worse. I’m feeling lost and overwhelmed with guilt because I know I can’t just take it away. He has his good days, such beautiful good days and it seems this depression can hit him out of nowhere and it lingers on him. But then it goes away for a short period of time which is what I think makes him feel he doesn’t need help… He doesn’t open up to me 100% but he has expressed he hates himself sometimes or sad about things from the past and I don’t know how to be supportive in a way that is positive for him.

Sometimes all someone needs is a hug. I'm not sure what might come out of it, but you could maybe ask if he would like one. Thing with me personally, I'm very very particular about hugging and there's only one person I'm wanting to ask which may be something to look into why that is in itself, so if your bf is like me, he might say no or give an uncomfortable answer. I will say though, if you can afford therapy, it's always worth it to give it a shot and I stand by that. It might not work all the time, but there may be a therapist around who just gets it.

Give him space, show him that you care but don't judge. Ask him if you can do anything to make him feel comfortable. And never tell him that 'it's not that bad' or something like that. Tell him it's okay and ask if theres something you can to for him to get through his episodes. But most important: be patient. This takes time. Don't be mad if it's a slow back and forth progress."

"One of the most effective, and challenging, ways to support your BF (anyone for that matter) is simply holding space. Holding space means to sit with them quietly and compassionately, not trying to ""fix"" them but rather working towards accepting them as they are.  
  
This can be such a huge challenge because of the discomfort that arises within us seeing someone we love struggling. But sitting with your own internal discomfort, in non-reactivity, helps the other person feel validated in their emotions. When we feel validated, seen and accepted as we are we are more capable of accepting ourselves and moving forward.  
  
The most compelling aspect of the practice of holding space is that it can help others transform while seemingly we ""do nothing.""

"How wonderful it is that you: 1) acknowledge you have a problem 2) have the desire to solve it  
  
This signifies that 50% of the problem is already solved! The remaining half is resolved through taking the right actions consistently over time.  
  
Let's reflect on children, even on our own childhood. What used to give us motivation, happiness, and enthusiasm? It wasn't money, facilities, attention from others, parental approval, long-term goals, or significant matters... It was merely the things that were within reach in that moment and place. Those simple things were enough to make us happy, play around, and approach life with curiosity and a sense of wonder.  
  
However, as we grow up, small and fleeting things cease to bring us the same joy, and this shift is a sign of maturity. An adult's happiness often lies in achieving substantial and enduring accomplishments. This is why you must self-motivate and commit to being 50% better on this day next week. Whether it's about developing a new habit or letting go of an old one.  
  
Commence with modest goals, such as dedicating an hour a day to learning something new within the upcoming week. Afterward, celebrate your achievements, and then set your sights on loftier goals.  
  
The encouraging news is that you are not alone – you have yourself! If you lose touch with yourself, no one else can find you, so engage in more positive self-dialogue and nurture your confidence in your own abilities.

"Motivation is intricately linked to interest. For instance, compare the experience of reading a book assigned by a teacher to reading an article about a subject you're passionate about. You'll naturally sprout motivation for whatever holds your interest. This concept extends to energy levels as well. 

Following this line of reasoning, I assume you are referring to tasks as simple as cooking or cleaning your room. To gather the necessary energy for these activities, they either need to align with your personal interests, such as if you possess a talent for cooking delicious meals, or they must serve a purpose. This purpose could stem from the activities themselves or from the fact that completing them is a prerequisite for something important you intend to do afterward.

I agree that having a life purpose would undeniably serve as a catalyst to ignite your motivation."	ReikoButFake	reply	na	na	na	0.9970898628234863	no	no	no	na	depression
"Trigger warning un-aliving thoughts that are vivid

I'm not sure if these are suicidal thoughts but I'm not sure it's normal to have very vivid images in your mind of yourself dieing in increasing stranger and more complex circumstances. They are intrusive thoughts, I don't want them, I don't like thinking about it, and I won't act on them, but I can't stop thinking of the most gruesome ways to die. It also sucks because I am aphantasia, so i can't visualize any type of image in my head. Instead I feel the pain, lack of breath, or coldness that I imagine I would feel in those situations. it just goes on repeat as I think about how you would end up in such a situation. I wish I could stop and am thinking about tripping and seeing if I could get some clarity that way of why I am like this. I'm pretty doubtful that would help in that way but open to it providing me wrong.

I guess I am hoping people respond to say I'm not crazy? Or want to hear if anyone else feels this sometimes?

Being better than average is still better than average! Better than most people! But still, compare yourself to *only* your past self. Because comparing yourself to someone else, who is living an *entirely different life* to you, is only going to make you feel frustrated.

I see flaws of course, you are always your greatest critic, but i'm no longer looking back through sketches with disgust. The fact you stuck with those activities long enough to develop your skills is proof you're able to hold out longer. 

You can only get better with time and practice. If you have any way of looking back at your previous results to see your progress, you should take some time to do that!

So I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorders and anxiety and currently am figuring out medication and therapy and all the stuff but there's one thing I haven't been able to get a clear answer on. At night (not always but usually) I will just get an insane mood drop and it could be in response to something or just while crocheting or something, but if it drops enough to where I'm crying, I CRY, and I mean CRY. I basically just sob and heave and hyperventilate and in the moment I feel like it's the most intense sad pain I've ever felt and I want to die and I can't make it through and then at a certain point it will just stop, and suddenly I'm fine again. I get really tired after probably just because of the whole body crying that was happening. But my therapist, psychiatrist and doctor have all never heard of something like this and I'm just so frustrated trying to figure out what's going on, as my depression symptoms have improved as well as anxiety, but this just seems to keep happening no matter what. Usually it has some correlation to my period and cycle, but not always so I really don't know what to do. Has anyone experienced something like this or know anyone who has?

"First of all, I'm not a native English speaker so I'm sorry if you find mistakes. 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for awhile, he suffers from depresion since he was younger. When we started  dating he showed some severe signs of the illness of but he always tried to avoid the topic to a greater extent.

Everything was relatively well, untill now. His holidays are ending soon and he's going back home with his family, during conversation about this topic he snap and started talking about how he won't be able to handle going back home and that he don't want to spend time alone thinking about his feelings, that he will cut himself as soon as he arrive and that he isn't sure if he will make It to the end of the month. I tried to convice him to not unalive himself and it seems to worked out but he still talking about cutting. 

I'm really worry because I haven't seen him so bad in all the time we've been together, he was almost 6 months free without selfharm too. Any think I could do? 

Thanks for reading and sorry for any spelling mistakes made."	Okami543	post	17.09008797095251	male	White	0.7154613733291626	na	na	na	5	depression
"As someone who personally struggled with cutting (F28), I think it's good he's willing to talk about it and not just struggling alone. But yes I would ask if he's willing to get help to stop. It can be a really difficult pattern to break and it sounds like you've been able to be empathetic and patient so that's good. 

Have you asked him what kind of support he would like from you when he's struggling? Sometimes he may want to talk and sometimes just having someone to distract from urges can be really helpful too.

Definitely take care of yourself and remember you aren't responsible for the behavior and can't be his only support.

Hope some of this helps."	Okami543	reply	na	na	na	0.7154613733291626	weak	no	no	na	depression
"As someone who used to self harm, yes he needs help for his mental health, but not to the detriment of your own. Try to support him as much as you can, but don’t burn yourself out. Perhaps in the future you can explore growing his support system so you are not the only one he can depend on, such as therapy or new groups of people (since he does not want to be alone with his thoughts). I think distracting him and surrounding yourselves with good people will help him take his mind off of his family.

I’m sorry you are both going through this, and I can imagine how painful it must be to watch a loved one struggle with self harm. The only thing I can suggest for now is to not bring up the topic of his family or anything related to it (it is a trigger) and continue on as normally as possible. 

Remember that you are doing the best you can to support him but at the same time should not feel responsible for his self harm. 

I remember back when I used to harm myself, my thoughts and emotions would jump up and down very suddenly. One day I would attempt to off myself, another I felt numb, and some days were okay. Remember that his state right now is temporarily changed because of the sudden stress (of thinking about going home). And the most straightforward way to bring him out of that, is to keep him away from the stress source as much as possible."	Okami543	reply	na	na	na	0.7154613733291626	weak	no	no	na	depression
That sounds toxic. Honestly, he needs therapy. You shouldn't have to have your own sociological scares because he can heal his. If he doesn't seek major psychological help, you need  to leave.	Okami543	reply	na	na	na	0.7154613733291626	no	no	no	na	depression
"Thanks for the comment,

Right now he is receiving therapy sessions with a psychologist and has an appointment with a doctor at the end of the month to assess whether to prescribe medication.

 I've tried before to find a way to comfort him when he's struggling, he always says that he don't want to worry me and he just avoid the topic as I said, even tho I asked him a hundred times if he wants to talk about It.

I think he feels better whenever we're doing something together so I try to spend as much time as I can with him. For now I talked to a friend of both to see if he was able to spend some time with him, playing or hanging out while I'm away since it's going to be impossible for me to be 24h focusing on him and if not he's going to be pretty lonely.

My main concern is going back to school, this is my last year and it will be quite hard for me to spend as much time as I would like with him since I have to work hard to get into a good college and we don't live close to each other.

"Thank for the advice!

I contacted some friends and family to let them know what's going on and to see if they could keep him distracted as much as possible.

As you said, I think this relapse has a lot to do with the stress of going back home and having to deal with his family again, he was also pretty stress because he couldnt find a job or something to study for this coming year and he was feeling meaning less and since the summer vacations are coming to an end he's getting even more stress thinking how he won't do anything profitable.

I'll try to keep him distracted as much as possible untill he starts de-stressing.

"That can be hard. In some ways you can never truly know why someone is spending time with you. That's just the nature of the human race.

But I find it also doesn't matter with the exception of someone who is spending time with you to take advantage of you. Most of the time our negative thoughts about what we believe others are thinking about us is purely what we choose to infer from their behavior. I've talked to people who always assume the worst of people, but it's all in their head. They'll infer someone saying they need help because their getting older or are sick as the other person telling them they're less than rather than the other person reaching out out of love and concern for their well-being. Add the saying good: if everyone you meet is an asshole then you're the real asshole.

If you assume people spend time with you because they like you, you'll be happier and less anxious about the relationship. By virtue of feeling better about the relationship you'll make it easier for the other person to want to spend time with you.

In this way even if they truly are spending time with you because they pity you, eventually they will feel differently because you feel differently.

Truly though my friend, human beings don't go out of their way to spend time with someone who sucks. If people spend time with you, aren't leaving in like 30 minutes, and they keep coming back; they are there because they want to be there. If not they'd disappear or cut you out. And if that's the case find better friends. Plus what's so wrong about having people in your life that care enough about you to spend time with you even if it is out of pity sometimes."

All I do is just survive and even that just drains me of all my energy. I feel so upset with myself that I’ve wasted my life and yet I can’t seem to do anything about it. I don’t know what to do / how to help myself get out of this hopeless loop.  I don’t know why I don’t want to change bad enough to actually make it happen. It just doesn’t make any sense.

"I'm also 19 and you're right life is a cycle of ups and downs. But what I can tell you is that you can lessen the impact of these downs by becoming more resilient. Start small. Focus on the things you can improve not on those you have no control over. 

With the amount of shit life throws at us it's not gonna get better instantly. Hell, it may not even get better and your efforts might just as well be futile. But doing something will always still be better than doing nothing because you'll be increasing your chance at making things better by at least 1%, and that's already an improvement from 0%.

Choose to take on these problems one small step at a time or else they will consume you. Willingly view them as challenges that you can solve, kinda like what you're doing now by asking how. Start by finding one action you can take to improve your situation. Do this continuously and the good results will start to pile up."

"Sigh, okay so let me tell you how I fucked up real bad that my own mother doesn't even wanna talk to me

I am Charles, a 13 year old living in the Philippines

I have a sister named Marianne she's 14, she is older than me because she came out months before me..

It's been years now

Me and my sister used to be close back then but nowadays we barely even talk and sometimes we get into fights because she starts yelling at me for no reason at all..

And well today, I messed up the most that I don't think I could fix this mistake and make my mom forgive me

My sister got mad at me because I wasn't able to answer a call from my mom and it was just 1 call and 1 mistake..

She then straight up latched out on me for that one mistake, yelling and chaos ensued

As I walked out of the room of our grandma which where we sleep in and share with our grandma

She followed me downstairs, and let me tell you I was trying to sleep to clear my head.

Before I continue I have to explain the things that calm me down

Sleeping, peaceful places and sounds can clear my mind from stress and etc.

Okay let's continue..

She followed me down and forced me to talk to Mom,

When I had enough I threw that pillow I was using to sleep at her then while she gave me the phone I told my mother why she'd let me live with her...

While my mother was trying to calm me down I accidentally said the most horrible thing I could have said,

WHY DIDN'T YOU ABORT ME!!??

YOU HAD 2 CHOICES, LET ME LIVE OR ABORT ME SO I'D DIE AND SHE'D LIVE AS AN ONLY CHILD..

My mom was upset I was too..

I ran to the bathroom to get some space and complained why she'd rather let me live with a person who's just faking all that responsible things they did to protect me then years later be cold to me and rather want me to die so that they could get her trust than let me die while I was still developing...

After that, I took a nap woke up and called my Mom to apologize and guess what...

I made her upset that she didn't wanna pick up,

How do I fix this?

Don't worry i've been there, made terrible mistakes and was terrefied my mother would never forgive me,but i apoligized again and again untill she slightly got a little less angry , it might seem like the end of the world , but it's not , it's just a bad day not a bad life, apologize then give her some space , then go back later and give her a hug , then some space , then give her something sweet like a cake and apologize and tell her that she is the best mother ever, but that you are just an idiot who's learning, and maybe also tell her how you feel about this mistake, then she will take a dreep breath and she will talk to you, you will listen to her calmly and try to understand her, when she talks remember that it's not about you, it's about how you hurt her émotions, then tell her that you love her and you will learn from this,give her a hug and it's all behind you, .....

I have been saying similar things again and again to my mom whenever I'm upset and want to die. I must be a sinner... and I still got forgiven. Don't worry you're good.

Looking back as a now 26-year old, I’ve said some pretty horrible things to my mom as a teenager. We definitely fought, I was unhinged, and called her terrible things. But we move forward. Now my mom and I have never been closer. As a teenager, your emotions are INTENSE and turbulent, like a wild storm.  There will be times where you won’t even believe the words that come out of your mouth. It happens to so many of us. Don’t beat yourself for it. Things might be difficult for a little bit, but once things settle down, open up to your mother about how you were feeling. It will take time, but things will get better. It’s a bumpy ride for sure with lots of ups and downs, but you will learn to ride the waves.	Long-Ad-662	reply	na	na	na	0.9987118244171143	no	strong	no	na	depression
"Hi Charles

When you and your mom have calmed down talk to her and tell her how sorry you are that you said that and that you didn't meant it and that's not what you think.

The positive thing is you tried to do what you needed to do to calm yourself down but unfortunately things were already out of control.

You and your sister and your mom should also talk and try to find ways to improve things with you and your sister.

You hurt your mom and I don't thing you meant to do it but when emotions are running high some bad things we don't mean can be said.

It may take several attempts to sort things out with your mom but she will forgive you and you both can get past this.

Consider talking to your sister and hopefully you both can agree to work on getting along better.

Calmly remind her that when you start getting upset you need to try and sleep and do things that help you settle down.

You made a mistake and it sounds like you feel bad about what was said and what happened.

Don't try to put any blame on who's fault it was sounds like you and your sister both made some mistakes.

Work on sorting things out with your mom and in the future if your feeling like your loosing control try to tell whoever your arguing with that you need to take break and work on getting yourself settled down.

You made a mistake and said some things that you didn't mean but you also tried to get yourself out of the situation so you could work on getting calmed down.

Hope your doing ok and have calmed down."	Long-Ad-662	reply	na	na	na	0.9987118244171143	weak	no	no	na	depression

There are positives like you did try to get settled down by removing yourself and trying to sleep.

Everyone makes mistakes and when we are upset we can say or do things that hurt others.

Keep up with talking about what happened and apologizing for getting so upset.

Along with trying hard to settle things work on getting along and not arguing.

i’m on antidepressants if that affects anything. have been for nearly 3 years. i just have such a lack of motivation and interest in anything. i also have an issue with being a perfectionist and i’m so impatient that hobbies i do try just frustrate me.

"W/19. 
Seit jahren leide ich an starken Depressionen, borderline und anderen Diagnosen wie beispielsweise: 
- Entwicklung einer emotional instabilen Persönlichkeitsstörung 
- Akute Belastungsreaktion
- Mehrfacher Missbrauch von Tabletten
- Durchgängige soziale Beeinträchtigung in den meisten fällen 

Aufjedenfall geht es mir jeden Tag schlecht. 
Ich fühle mich nicht nur einsam, sondern wie gefühlt der einzigste mensch auf diesem planeten.
Ich komm nicht über meine Vergangenheit.
Meine mutter schickte mich mit 9 jahren in ein heim wo es mir immer schlechter ging in den 6 jahren wo ich dort war. Ich verletzte mich selber und versuchte mich umzubringen. Zwar hatte ich mehrfach therapeuten aber diese halfen nie wirklich. Ich hab mich immer gewundert warum mich nie jemand verstand, niemand mich je so akzeptierte wie ich bin. ich hatte noch nie richtige freunde. also echte, mit denen ich spass haben konnte und über alles reden konnte. ( im echten leben). Mein vater verließ uns als ich kleiner war. Mein Stiefvater zog mich auf als baby. Und mit 9 war ich ja dann im heim. 
Meine mutter war schon immer egoistisch gewesen. Sie kümmerte sich kaum um uns. 
Mittlerweile ist sie sehr manipulativ, aggressiv und egoistisch. toxisch wahrscheinlich auch. 
Meine Schwester zieht diesen monat wahrscheinlich hoffentlich aus, weil ich mein eignes zimmer haben möchte. 
Aufjedenfall möchte ich schon seit jahren nicht mehr hier auf dieser welt sein weil ich mich fühle als gehöre ich hier nicht hin. 
Und ich denke, wenn ich nicht mehr da sein werde, würde es die welt auch nicht untergehen lassen. Damit will ich sagen dass es wahrscheinlich eh nix besonderes wäre egal ob ich lebe oder tod bin.

"i have been on leave from work since the end of march while i’m working to find the right treatment for my depression. today i started on my newest attempt, the fourth antidepressant we’re trying out. 

in this time i’ve disregarded showers entirely. i don’t leave the house hardly anyway. we have a very crappy shower that’s cramped to even crouch down in. the door is broken and we’re using a tarp (not looking for advice on how to get the landlord to fix that). the water pressure goes between spitting rain and having to shake the shower head to get water out. 

i used to love showering and feeling clean. hot summers like this used to mean showering two or three times a day. 

lately i’m down to one shower a week, if that. i don’t even always wash my hair. my scalp has been suffering and i just feel so gross all the time. enjoying the actual act of showering has become impossible here (i’m stuck in this lease until march). i don’t know how to get back into the habit of it when it is no longer enjoyable but instead stress inducing.

"I never thought, my life would be like this. When I was a child I remember thinking why would anybody want to kill themselves ? it just didn’t make sense. But now, I think about it everyday, I don’t feel like a real person anymore. I have no energy after I come home from work, it’s the same every day. 

By now I’ve made my rounds with therapy and meds and I keep relapsing to this hopelessness. I feel like there’s nothing for me. I failed my education, and I’m a average at my job and spend so much more time working to do stuff my colleagues would have finished, I have no social life, I’m introverted but I also have severe social anxiety, I’ve worked on it and can talk to people now ,but I don’t have the energy. My parents were incapable of understanding so I pushed them away. 


I have nothing In my life but myself and I hate myself. I’m not a person just a amalgamation of disorders and bad habits with sentients,  I wake up each day wishing I didn’t and yet, I lack the balls to fully commit again, I don’t have any worth but being alive beats the alternative right? I thought I wasn’t fully afraid, I don’t think I am afraid anymore but I can’t help but think what if, what will I miss when I no longer exist. 

All I feel like I do is vent and scream to myself about  how shitty  things are in a constant cycle of self pity. But I do know now that I’m less then everybody else, I wish more than anything I was a different person, who felt things differently and be able to live a life other then this,

The stress and mixed with everything else I am, kinda boiled over and I didn’t do half my exams for my second semesters and took a leave of absence,  

I was only able to go to college because I got a low income household grant, that my parents applied for, both my siblings got the same when they went to college and made far more use of it, my brother who has a form of Asperger’s, and if I’m being honest was considered the fuck up in our family , also it is in no way his fault, a bad financial situation mixed with extra pressure and a disorder like that, makes it extra difficult for someone like that to not act out. Anyways he found is calling in a few things and pretty much mastered them, he’s now next in line for junior sue chef at a 1 Michelin star restaurant at 23 ,while my sister who go the brains In the family is now in the middle of getting her phd in psychology, my family were underdogs I suppose because of our financial situation and both my siblings beat it, while I fuxking failed, I m at the end of my leave of absence and now is returning to my course, without the benefits of the grant so I have to pay it myself with help from my dad, for the past year I took up a job in which my major is in “risk management” so I’ve been working in insurance,

I must say my anxiety has gotten better, as I’m speaking with brokers a lot on the phone and I no longer have silent panick attacks when the phone rings, but it’s slow and steady progress, and I still have an enormous amount of irrational anxiety, it the world to me is utterly grey and black, I don’t really see hope in anything, I’m struggling at work, school and my social life, and I’m wasting my days being miserable, I have a sprinkle of abuse that is holding me back from a relationship, as well as the anxiety of being around another person, 

All I do is go to work, come home barely eat , and go to bed, I used to  run cross country and play football when I was a teenager, training three times a week and in the gym the other four and now I’m a pathetic mess of skin and bone.

She grew up well off, while I had to struggle financially since I was a kid. I fear that as this continues I'll begin to resent her for not pulling her weight. That's my rant.

"I have nobody in my life. My mom abandoned me when I was 12. My dad kicked me out twice once when I was 17 and then when he legally could get rid of me at 18. My other family doesn’t give a shit about me. I’m 23 now and idk what to do anymore I’m so anxious all the time that I’m missing out on life and I’m angry that I have nobody that cares about me.

 I’ve thought of suicide since I was 17 and it makes me almost burst into tears for thinking such a thought. There is nothing for me. This weight on me is so big that I can’t enjoy anything else. Not simple pleasures or bigger goals to make my life more satisfying. Nothing does it for me anymore. 

Every time I see a family enjoying themselves or friends out together I get sad. very sad. I think ti myself “that will never be me, that never was me” I don’t know what to do anymore I just bawled my eyes out by myself again I have nobody to open up to about this so I’m posting it here"	meinequeso	post	15.192682505569817	female	White	0.9979627132415771	na	na	na	1	depression

"I constantly feel like my entire existance is little more than a blight upon the world and those around me. My mom, kids and extended family do not talk to me, been more than 3 years now. If I do not reach out to friends, I never hear from anyone. I go to parties and end up alone. It is not my vibe, people always enjoy my company in small gatherings or one on ones. But in large gatherings, I am simply brushed aside. 
I know that I do not matter to anyone and never have. I constantly and crushed by feelings of solitude, lonliness and a sadness so deep, I cannot put it into words. But every day, I get up and put on my brave face, because as a man, I am not allowed to show weakness or vulnerability.

Like the title says, I'm realizing more and more that nobody gives a fuck. The SOLE reason I haven't blown my brains out is because of my kids. Sometimes I feel like they'd be better off without me. In fact, I'm almost sure of it at this point. I'm just tired. I know I'm not the only one, not by a long shot. That's why I know I'm nothing but another number that doesn't matter. I can't turn my brain off. The voices won't shut the fuck up. The nightmares won't go away. Work fucking sucks and won't pay enough. I haven't been the best father, although I can honestly say I gave it my all. I'm not a great husband. My whole family would be better off without me. Anyways, thanks for reading my post.

I'm glad you're able to open up and release some of those feelings you've been having. I disagree with you about your family being better off without you. People who don't love their family also don't think of them to the point of taking their own lives to make their loved ones lives a little easier. You obviously love them a lot, and that by itself means a lot, especially to kids. They want someone who they can tell about how well they did on a test at school, and someone who is there to hug them when they're crying. I'm sure you do those things for your kids, and I hope you stick around to continue to be there for them. The point is, you don't need to be dad of the year to be a great dad, you just need to be present. You think it will be easier for them, but it won't, and I think deep down you know that, but the depression is covering up that truth right now. I hope you keep being a good dad and husband.	cerealkiller454	reply	na	na	na	0.9983354210853577	weak	no	no	na	depression

I know it is not easy for a depressed person to think positive but please know that you are not alone. You are capable of doing so much just like anyone else. Don’t give up on yourself.

Taking care of a child is not easy, I think everyone realizes that. If you're a parent that's something you have to work on everyday for YEARS to get right, or else your child will grow up with lots of trauma. I know they never intended for this to happen, but I honestly wish they never had me. I don't know why they thought they could take care of two children, especially when they were already broke and addicted to many drugs. I feel like it's unfair that I have to basically be my own parent and take care of myself because my parents never bothered to do any of the work. My dad is 40+ years old but still acts like a teenager, my mom suffers from bipolar and is a few years younger than him. Just because I love my parents doesn't mean they didn't screw up. They did. They brought two children into this world without thinking about how much work it would actually take to support two kids. And for awhile my dad went to prison when I was younger, so I was just stuck in a trailer with my mom and older brother for awhile. Some things are better, some stayed the same. But me, I feel like I've gotten worse. I'm trying so hard everyday just to stay alive and keep it together. I'm 22 years old, still live with my parents, and I honestly don't see a future for me. I expect they'll kick me out soon and leave me for dead. Taking care of a child is something that takes a lot of work, you have to really care for them and it's a day-to-day thing. And it's for that exact reason why I'll never have kids. I can barely even take care of myself, let alone another human being. I can't even take care of an animal. I keep wishing that things will just get better on its own, but I know that's not how it works. I feel like my parents fucked over my whole life and I'm trying so hard not to just end it all. I also think it's not fair that I get blamed for things that aren't my fault. I never wanted this, I never wanted to be a depressed loser who still lives at their parents house. If I knew how to be happy I'd be happy. I'm sick of people who act like being happy is just a switch that I can turn on anytime or that I'm just choosing to be depressed.

"I really hate life. I don't want to ""take care of"" anyone. I want to work *with* people, not solve their problems for them. Which is why life is shit, because as much as I try to make my work as impersonal as possible, you always come to an impass; interpersonal relationships. Look, when I'm at work, I'm here to do a job. I don't give a fuck about you, or your feelings, or your family. If there is a job related issue it is the clients responsibility to communicate that. I don't care about small talk and I don't care for smiling. I'm just here to do the fucking job. And my attitude doesn't come from a fucking vacuum. I try to be polite, treat people right, and I'm still treated like I'm the one being an asshole. People feel like they have the right to be short with me. Just fuck all of them."

"I was diagnosed 3 years ago with ADHD, anxiety, and depression, but recently it's like my medications have stopped working for the most part. I've been on a downward trend since June and just crashed into a massive depressive episode, when the morning started off fine and I haven't had one like this in years.
I've spent most of my day in bed being unable to move or get up, thinking... not so nice thoughts... and wanting to take sleeping medication to ""go to sleep and never wake up"" because I'm just so *tired*. I can't function, think, act, or love like any other normal person does, and I wish so badly that I could just function normally, like I'm NOT a neurodivergent ace with 15 years of trauma. I thought I'd be able to get better on this medication, and it was ok for a while but now it's worse and I feel like its my fault and my meds don't need to change, I just need to get up and do stuff, but every task is a mental struggle. I feel like I'm just a liar doing this to get attention, and not trying hard enough, even though I hear the opposite from loved ones.

Try to show yourself compassion and love because you deserve it.

"I almost miss being sad and hopeless now. The medicines I’m taking have fully kicked in and settled and I no longer have awful thoughts 24/7. You think I’d be happy right? Well…

Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, entertains me anymore. I have cycled through every video game I have ever liked + new ones. I have gone out with friends. I have played with dog. I have watched TV, read books, listened to music. There is not a single thing that has gotten me out of this chronically bored state. I think I could jump off a plane right now and be bored doing it. 

I didn’t know boredom could be so awful. At least before I felt things. At least before I could lose myself for hours, days, and months inside a video game. Hell, even crying was mildly entertaining. It was SOMETHING. Holy crap I’m so bored. 

I’m the personification of this emoji 😐

Has anyone gone through this? I feel like I’m dead inside. Any tips? I…I think I almost would rather be depressed. I am genuinely considering just stopping medication and going back to being sad."	EngFind	post	15.277246908997917	female	White	0.9994722008705139	na	na	na	2	depression
"yeah i’ve had that feeling for about 15 years now. a lot of my free time spent not doing the bare minimum to take care of myself, i spend fantasizing or scheming ways to wake up my emotions. there’s a couple things that have had some affect for me, one being getting into relationships with emotionally volatile people who make me feel like the only stable thing in their life (which helps my self esteem in a fucked up way), the other being making huge life altering decisions just to see what happens. like quitting my job and moving away to the opposite side of the country alone kind of life altering, it gives me a short lived feeling of hope and curiosity, but obviously that’s not sustainable long term. everything else is just so fucking boring and empty. only reason i’m not doing drugs constantly is shame and fear of being a burden.

"Hi, I suffer from moderate depression and have been taking prescription medication to help. However, when things just started to get a bit better with my depression (I was being more productive on my masters thesis) a close family relative passed away and it feels like I’m back in that dark place again where I can’t get out of bed or just function. I’m away from my family as I am at university for my masters degree. I feel disconnected from home and have lost all motivation with my masters thesis. I am struggling just to complete daily tasks like feeding myself. It feels like with this downward spiral I will fail my degree when I finish it in September. I want to finish my degree that I have worked so hard for but my mind is foggy and I have no interest in doing anything anymore.

"I think this is an odd perspective.  You're not singled out.  Everyone has a rough go at some point.  You sound like you're currently in a rough patch.  If your partner is having mental issues, like schizophrenia, they need to be on medication.  That stuff does not sort itself out on its own.  It's definitely a harder diagnosis but it's not untreatable.  He needs to know that if he doesn't treat you right, that you will leave. But if you care for him, take care of yourself first and then try to assist him.  If he refuses to get help, then you know what you need to do.  The medication is not just for him, it's for both of you so that the relationship and life functions better.

If 50% of relationships end in divorce, then 50% of families are essentially ""broken homes"".  We grow up and try to make the best of it.  Don't hold on to someone because you're afraid to be alone.  Hold on to them because they make you a better you.

Same. Its so hard to motivate when life seems so utterly futile. However, every day can have some good moments. Today I made myself a beef and tomato sandwich with garlic mayo on tiger bread and just sat and focused on how good it tasted.

"This requires some background, sorry for the length.

Growing up, money was always a big stress. I grew up in the Northeast and never had a jacket because my dad would make me feel guilty for making the family spend money by asking for one. It was always a thing of mine. When I have kids, I will look forward to taking him/her to buy a jacket. They'll find it weird, I know, and never fully understand it, but it will fill me with so much pride. That's just one small example of the many, **many**, financial stresses I had growing up. I'm crying through my face as I type this. 

Because of that, I studied Finance in college and worked my ass off to try to get a good job, but for a couple of reasons (graduating in 2009 during the Great Recession, for example), the right one never panned out. I got a job at a start up eventually and was always deeply underpaid, but was told that if our company did well, we would all be very well taken care of. I worked nights, weekends, basically all the stuff Boomers said we should do to be successful, and eventually we signed a major client to take our business to the next level. But the owners screwed us. Never gave us that payday. Because of that, I started looking for a new job.

I work in finance in NYC where pedigree is everything, and didn't have that Ivy background. I tried to fight it thinking I wouldn't need an MBA from there, but eventually I realized it would make sense to get it. I was worried about the debt, the not having an income, and the fear of graduating in another 2009 so I don't know how I would be able to pay off all that student loan. Eventually, I got in and am getting my MBA at an ivy on nights and weekends while still keeping my day job.

Now, given all that background, I've been able to piece together that my boss will sell the company and is actively talking to a buyer, meaning I will likely be laid off when this happens. I've been applying to jobs without much luck ever since my boss screwed me over years ago. I'm sure most of the people reading this have experienced the reasons for not getting a new job - not enough experience for some, too much experience for others, a better fit with a difference applicant, the company never intended on hiring in the first place, using the interview to just solve an internal problem by making it an interview question, etc.

Persistence paid off as I was told that a company in Boston was really interested in me, and they were prepared to give me an offer for an amount that would put any money issues to rest. When I heard that, I think I had the first real night of sleep in 36 years. I felt 10 pounds lighter. For the first time that I can remember, I got to know what it felt like without that heavy ""cloudy head"" being stuck the front of my forehead.

A few nights ago, my wife flat out tells me that if I take this job, she's not going to Boston with me. She never told me this before about her reservations for moving until now. She doesn't want to move there since we don't have friends there and she wants to be close to family in the NYC area. I was shocked as I figured we were on the same page, and I even was ready to move with her to CA when she applied for a job there (which didn't work out) a few years ago. I had to choose between my wife and putting all of my issues to rest, and I chose her. I called the company earlier today and told them that I can't accept it since I can't relocate. Afterwards, I was physically sick to my stomach. I haven't been breathing right all day with that tight knot in the middle of my chest. 

I've never felt like this before. I had to drink a lot to at least try to help, which wasn't smart since I have an exam tomorrow morning. Being drunk is likely the only reason I'm typing this since I'm not to share emotions too much. I feel lost, scared because of the ""ticking time bomb"" of getting laid off, confused, betrayed a little, and frankly I just feel defeated. 

I just don't know."	The_Nomadic_Nerd	post	30.718615104669823	male	White	0.9932307004928589	na	na	na	1	depression
Hi there. I'm sorry you're going through this. It sounds really tough, and you're obviously stressed out. I think you're going to be fine, though, I know that finding a job isn't easy, and you thought the Boston job would solve things, but I'm glad you chose to turn it down. My instinct is telling me that if your wife is not OK with moving to Boston for that job, you're probably better off financially than you're giving yourself credit for, right? Meaning you're not going to be on the street anytime soon. Youre obviously still feeling the effects of being poor as a child, and you want to provide everything your family needs, jackets included. But what you're not seeing is that you just provided for your family by turning down that job. What your wife needed was to stay close to family and friends, and you put your own desires and comfort aside for her. You should be proud of yourself for that. It will get better soon.

It’s going to be about 5 months after my break up doing no contact. And I’ve still been really depressed. People say to work on yourself and move on but all I can feel is pain and hurt, it makes me constantly shut down. I go on with my life just constantly working but once I’m home and want to relax, I get immediately depressed. As much as I go to the gym and I’m starting to listen to affirmations every morning, a part of me just feels so broken. I want to move on, I want to accept that he no longer loves me anymore. I want to do better for myself, but I’m constantly feeling and wanting to shut down every time I try to do something to make me feel better.

"I'm sorry you're going through this. I don't think there's a set time period for how long you are allowed to be sad or deprwor heartbroken. So I hope you're not hard on yourself for not moving on sooner. However, there are things you can do that may help. Have you taken a ""you day"" lately, where you take the day off work and just do whatever you want to do, no pressure? It sounds like you could use one. Maybe go get a massage, or order in and binge watch a TV show all day. Something like that. I think that slef improvement isn't all about ""go go go"", it's also about your mind's wellbeing, and something simple like a relaxing day to yourself can be self-improvement, while at the same time relieving stress."

The path to you getting there will be long, that's why you feel this way. But in the end it comes down to decisions. What small decisions can you make everyday to get you there? You can get there by making good decisions everyday. Don't give in to fear, and don't give up. Your path will be unique to you and that is what will give your life the meaning your looking for. It's not that you don't belong your projecting your insecurities on to them. I do the same. But what if you talked to those people? What if you found out they went through some incredible hardships and struggle. We're all in the same boat. Everyone is dealing with something, everyone is doing the best they can. Empathize with people and realize there is no difference between you and them. They've made good decisions and bad ones just like you and me. They've built a strong network over a period of time.

and by buffer, I mean a safe distance. say for example there are two people the first person has 100 bucks (poor) and the other 100k (rich), wasting say $90 on gambling or something like that isn't really much of an issue for the rich guy but it could/will hurt the poor guy several orders of magnitude more.

I would compare binge eating to a drug. We think we're better than drug addicts but we're all addicted to something to numb the pain.

I've always hated Friday evenings the most. When I worked in an office I'd hear people discussing their plans for the weekend, and I'd end up working late because I dreaded the emptiness of going home. As outgoing as I am, as easily as I make friends, when you get to the age where everyone has someone it's really hard to get people to spend time with you. Fridays still feel so empty to me. I wonder what I would be like if I'd been loved, cared about, had been able to make good memories all these years.

"As the title states I've found pain makes me feel alive, human tbh as most of the time I feel numb neither really feeling sadness or happiness. 

Whether it be trivial pain like picking at my eczema or getting a slight bruise or something more serious like the odd time cutting myself the thrill of being hurt and in pain feels so good. I feel alive, I feel like I have emotions again for a brief amount of time.

I'm on antidepressants and in therapy, before any of that I was numb and enjoyed really injuring myself to feel emotion. Now I find with the meds even injuring myself isn't as pleasurable anymore.

"TLDR at bottom
Trigger warning: self harm

Some days are better than others of course. Today was great till I got home from work. Recently my place of work has turned into a place that makes me feel sick thinking about. The amount of stress that place causes me has actually begun to affect my health (for anyone wondering it’s a big red store that sells office supplies and electronics. The name is something we definitely sell)

Today was an amazing day. The only person I can rely on came back from vacation and aside from how busy it’s been it was a great day. I was happy and decided to pick up my daughter some kinder eggs (Canadian here) she is technically a little young at 2.75 but she doesn’t eat normal things so her choking on it isn’t really a concern as well as I monitor her with these toys. It was a paw patrol dog toy that was inside. She loves dogs so I thought she’d enjoy them.

Now to give a little context before I truly get into the depression, my husband gave her the first paw patrol kinder egg toy she has, as well as a few others so I didn’t see any issues with it. We take them away before bed and such so I don’t understand where the issue is there. I also still hold some pain that I’m working through due to the traumatic birth I had, as in I feel like I failed her for needing a C-section. I know I didn’t but my emotional side says otherwise. She’s perfect and healthy and beautiful. I couldn’t have asked for her to be healthier but the expectation of a natural birth thanks to television was shattered and wrecked me for a long time and I’ve come to terms with it for the most part. Last time I was actually upset about it was over a year ago. Now I share my story with confidence.

The depression; when I got home from work I gave my daughter the egg to eat while I quickly assembled the 3 piece toy and gave it to her. Mind you I just walked in, took off my shoes but not my jacket. My husband came and saw me giving her the toy and he says “wow, that’s good parenting, giving her stuff she can choke on” now I’m not sure why he would say that considering the stuff he lets her play with and do or the things he himself does that I don’t approve of but does anyway.

I took it as him saying I’m a horrible parent because that is kind of what he said. When saying good sarcastically you mean the opposite, am I correct in thinking that? Well either way I took offence and cried for an hour since it brought back all the feelings of failure. We argued and I went in the bathroom to be in a dark confined space for comfort while he went grocery shopping without me and took our girl. I’m not sure why he would say something like that or be angry at me for being upset. I’m not breaking up with him so don’t bother with those comments. We’ve come to far for me to leave him over that. I just needed to vent.

Anyway this has brought up a lot of feelings that I guess I was suppressing and I want to self harm very bad. I haven’t in almost 9 years. I’ve been proud of that but the amount I want to right now is driving me mad. Every part of me just wants to die because I’m a failure of a parent. I wish I didn’t exist, I wish I didn’t have a child to fail, a husband to let down, a life to leave behind. I just wish I was never born that way I wouldn’t have to be as young as I am having so many issues. I’m already a cripple at 24 and with all the issues I’ve been having it seems like my life is only getting worse. Everyone used to say it would get better.

Am I just cursed to always be sad? Can’t I just be happy? For one full day I want to be happy….. thanks for reading. I’m going to go cry and hope this heart ache goes away before I die of a broken heart

TLDR: my husband insulted my parenting which I already feel I fail with. This makes me want to stop existing and punish myself. All over something he himself does too."	SlickBounce	post	31.073071610869086	female	White	0.9803056716918945	na	na	na	0	depression

I'm sorry you're going through this. It's tough, I know. First thing is knowing that there is help. Second thing is reaching out, and you've already kind of done with this post, but unfortunately we cannot fix this, but a doctor and therapist have the tools to help you fix it. Don't worry about how your face looks or your hygiene right now. Trust me, kids who would be mean to you about those things would still be mean if you went to school with a giant smile and smelling like flowers. So try to focus on yourself and getting yourself in the best position to succeed. If you can talk to a parent or teacher, that would be great too! As someone who has been in a very similar situation, having some support around you will help you immensely. I hope you get the help and support you need, and start feeling better soon.

With every conversation I have, I make a completely fake personality to make that person like me the most. Everyone I know thinks I'm a good guy, but the truth is I'm a terrible person. I despise most of the people I come into contact with, I legit think I'm better than everyone else because I never complain about my problems. But the reason I never complain is because I just don't feel anything at all. I wouldn't care if my whole family died tommorow. Everything is gone. I feel like I have nothing inside of me and I'm dangerous because of that. Sometimes I get these urges to grab a rifle and shoot up a store because I really don't have any reason not to. It would be one fun thing to look forward to before I die. Or I could just kill myself so nobody gets hurt.

Have you always felt this way? Have you never felt bad for someone? If you feel like you are a terrible person, then I think that means you have the ability to sympathize and recognize emotional pain. A true sociopath wouldn’t struggle with the ideal of being a “terrible person.” It sounds like you are dealing with intrusive and impulsive thoughts.

"I am sorry you are suffering like this. I have suffered from depression and anxiety since I was a teen and it is brutal on your mind and your body. Medication and therapy may help but it all depends on the skills and compassion of the mental health provider you get.

What kind of help would you like to get? Therapy? A psychiatrist?"	BenTheUnbroken	reply	na	na	na	0.9990947246551514	strong	strong	strong	na	depression

No, that's what scares me. I was a normal kid until I turned 15, and I became very isolated. No permeate damage was done until I turned 16. I tried to kill myself and ended up not doing it. I told my grandparents, and they just said that I would've killed myself if I was actually sad and said I was a coward and a joke. I wanted to kill both of them that day, but I didn't. Everything inside of me died that day, and I have not enjoyed a single thing that's happened to me since then. I've just been holding out, hoping that it would pass. But it's just been getting worse. I am 19 now, so it's been over 3 years.	BenTheUnbroken	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9990947246551514	no	strong	no	na	depression
19. But this has been going on since I was 16. I have nothing to loom forward to, and I haven't found a single reason to live or stop myself from doing something awful.	BenTheUnbroken	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9990947246551514	no	strong	no	na	depression
I had a lot of the same experiences when I was younger. Depression and autism can combine to make brain weird.	BenTheUnbroken	reply	na	na	na	0.9990947246551514	no	strong	no	na	depression
Don't see it as a curse lol. We all have different skills and talents. Many times in my life I wish I could care about people less, would be a lot easier to let go. Main thing is we gotta accept ourselves to be our best selves.	BenTheUnbroken	reply	na	na	na	0.9990947246551514	no	strong	no	na	depression
Sorry to hear that, my family also didn’t take my mental health seriously when I was young. Have you taken yourself to the doctor for mental evaluation/ever tried medication? I can’t say that it will help you for sure but meds helped me for awhile.	BenTheUnbroken	reply	na	na	na	0.9990947246551514	strong	strong	strong	na	depression
It's like I'm being teased all the time. It's like I'm sitting in a jail cell, and the guard is dangling the keys in front of me, and right before I grab them, they're snatched from me. What I mean by that is that I feel aboustlely nothing, but then once in a while, I get inspired enough to do something about it, but right before I can do anything it fades away and I'm just reminded that this will go on forever. Constant misery with false hope that only reminds me of where I am.	BenTheUnbroken	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9990947246551514	no	strong	no	na	depression
Gotta ask yourself if you're okay with staying the same. If the answer is no, then commit to yourself to get better. We all have fleeting moments of motivation. It takes discipline to act on those feelings of wanting to be better. You're reaching out to people here, so I see that there is desire to get better in you. :)	BenTheUnbroken	reply	na	na	na	0.9990947246551514	weak	no	no	na	depression
