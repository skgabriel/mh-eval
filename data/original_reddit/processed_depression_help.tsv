"There are times I can feel normal and a few minutes later I just feel very sad for no reason.  
It could be in the middle of doing a task or watching something and suddenly all interest and motivation is gone.  


My head feels heavy, I feel slower, and I can't really think straight. (outside of negativity)  


Sometimes I wake up like this and it can take me an hour or 2 to get out of bed. Nights are probably the worse and it aids in my already bad insomnia. It's not very pleasant to be up for hours in the dark to where the only thing keeping you occupied is your own existential/suicidal thoughts.  


This feeling has been happening more often and it's really getting in the way of my daily life and workspace.

That said, the suddenness and randomness of these episodes is worrying. Have you been evaluated for other mental health issues?

"Hi guys. First time posting in here. I only found this group today and tbh I'm really glad coz it seems like the only place for some advice. 

My mum has severe depression, she has for years. She's had therapy and didn't find it helpful. She used to be on the highest dose of citalopran (not sure if that's the right spelling) the doctors changed her to something different a year and a half ago but it doesn't seem to be working. I'm also not sure what the new antidepressant is. 

She's in serious self destruct mode and pushing everyone away. She's my mum and I love her more than words can say but she is vile at the moment. 

It's like everyone around her has to walk on eggshells and any little thing will set her off. 

She refuses to go to a doctor as last time they didn't listen and just said continue trying the new medication for another month, by this point she had been on it for a year already. 

She's told me she hates herself and doesn't want to be here. She said she hasn't actually got the guts to do anything and I don't believe she would try and take her own life. 

I've tried getting her out of the house, she doesn't want to go anywhere. If anyone comes round she paints a smile on her face and acts fine then as soon as they're gone she's back to how she was. 

We're normally really close, text and talk everyday usually several times a day. Yesterday when I left hers she said she doesn't ever want to see my husband again and if I don't like the fact then I don't have to see her again. We haven't spoken at all today. 

I really don't know what to do! Any advice is really appreciated!"	Pale-Garlic5523	post	26.603649354618874	female	White	0.9956314563751221	na	na	na	1	depression_help

"I don’t know where to post this and I don’t know where to ask for help so I guess I’m here.

Last night I called the cops on my friend because I thought he was going to hurt himself. He was visiting town for a job interview and was struggling with a lot, and went downtown by himself. He invited me to go out but I had already made plans and couldn’t cancel on them so I declined. About 10:00pm he texted me saying he was sad and didn’t know what to do. I told him I’d stay up as long as I could but had work in the morning so I didn’t know how long I’d be able to text with him. He told me okay and would call me if he needed anything. Before I went to bed he mentioned going to a hotel he really liked because it reminded him of someone.

He’s been going through a lot recently and has numerous times told me he doesn’t feel like anyone can help him. That night I texted him saying stuff like “you’ve made so much progress and I’m proud of how you’re doing” but he would always decline it and say things like “I admire your optimism but I’m not fixable”. I’ve been concerned for a while and I know he has had suicidal thoughts before. Last time he visited he accidentally left some notes in the room he was staying at (about a month ago) that detailed who should do what and receive what if he was ever gone.

Last night around 11:30pm he called me crying. I saw I had a bunch of texts from him, the most recent saying “the bridge between these two buildings is very high”. I panicked and woke my roommate up and had her call the hotel while I stayed on the phone with him. The cops were involved and he was taken to a hospital last night.

This morning he called me angry. He says he’s so scared and is mad they’re not letting him leave despite him being an adult. His flight leaves this afternoon and he is mad he’ll most certainly miss it. He told me he just needed someone to talk to and now there’s a whole mess being made out of it.

I feel like I overrreacted and now he’s not going to trust me again. I don’t know what to do and I don’t know if I helped him at all. I just want him to be better and I was so scared he’d have done something last night. I just don’t know how to help."	anothercasualpotato	post	23.92287124521194	female	White	0.9987825751304626	na	na	na	4	depression_help

"You didn't overreact. I'd have done the same thing in your position, and I've been on the other end of things too. I was put in the ward on suicide watch for a few days, and then I was kept under pretty close watch for a few more days when I returned to my home unit. 
I was angry and upset at the time, but it was the push that got me talking to professionals, and after all these years, if I hadn't been caught, I don't think I'd be here.

"If the hospital won't let him leave then that's because they have risk assessed and deemed him high risk.

"Growing up, I was adventurous. I made friends so easily and was always making plans and hanging out with my school friends. 

Then, I became best friends with someone who I realised too late was toxic. Subtle bullying and undermining and just generally being mean and unkind. 

This all happened before I reached 17. Then my confidence took such a big hit. She became best friends with someone else and I lost all my self esteem and confidence which I haven't regained yet. 

I began college. I got close to another girl who was around 8 years older than me. We didn't hang outside of work or anything but I liked her. 
Then she left before the 2nd year. There were 4 girls remaining. 2 of them become best friends and the other girl was just so popular with everyone else. I felt outcast. 

I became close with one guy. We would text and email and we became very close friends. I loved hanging out with him and his family were great. 
Then he all of a sudden developed romantic feelings for me which I tried to reciprocate but I just couldn't. I liked him as a friend. I had zero experience with relationships and I didn't know what to do or how to act. So he cut contact and that was 10 years ago.

I work full time and in my old role, I got on with everyone. Everyone liked me and people would stop what they were doing to have a quick chat. It felt good. 
I got on really well with this guy, we would hang out outside of work at times and I really liked his company but I knew he wanted something romantic and I didn't. So I was trying so hard to drop hints which he eventually got. Now we don't talk at all outside of the standard happy birthday messages .

No one ever texts me from my old role. When I left everyone said they'll stay in contact with me but not one has. I text them to try and hang out and make plans but stuff always happens on their end. 

I've been told I'm lovely and people like me yet no one ever texts me or invites me anywhere .

I've never been in a romantic relationship. I I've dated but never had a boyfriend or girlfriend or whatever. I don't know why. I've just never been interested or attracted to anyone. 
I want a relationship, I want someone to come home to but I don't know why I can't feel attraction.

When I'm not at work, I'm at home. I had 4 days off and I didn't go out. Outside of family, I don't see anyone. 

I have started to feel really down and sad the last few months. This new job I have is giving me confidence, especially with driving and speaking 

I've been eating a lot of unhealthy food lately, often I don't eat properly for a few days. Just snacking and drinking water/tea. 

To summarise 

I'm 29 years old. Never been in a relationship, no one wants to hang out with me outside of work, I struggle with self esteem and anxiety, I cannot feel attraction to anyone, I spend my days off at home, watching TV or playing video games, I don't eat properly most days, I feel sad whenever I'm alone. My old work colleagues said they'll miss me and keep in contact, but they haven't. It's been 6 months and the only communication has been when I've text them to make plans which end up being cancelled on their end. 
I constantly feel like people pity me.
I want to be normal. Why don't I feel attraction, why haven't I ever been interested in getting drunk, and partying, why am I a loser ? Why have I reached the age of 29 and not accomplished a single thing. I haven't added anything to the world or to anyone. I'm feeling really down and I just want to wake up tomorrow a whole new person. I don't wanna be me anymore. I'm pointless. 
I'm just sad. My brother is married, my sister is married. My mum keeps saying I need to find a boyfriend but I have no motivation to find one. 
I don't want anyone to know how I am not experienced. I honestly cannot see myself ever finding love and that depresses me.

My wife and i are getting a divorce. I treated her horribly. I was just mean and condesending and i didnt even realize what i was doing. I never saw it. Looking back i realize she attempted to talk to me but i guess she always got too scared. I never hit her or anything, i was just always mean and angry. Im 22 and she is 23. High school sweethearts. 2 kids ages 2 and 3. She told me she wanted a divorce august 1st. We had a big fight and agreed we both had things to work on early july. I started working but i guess she just gave up. We are still living together, we want to co parent with our kids, and be close. We still care for each other. But she says she just needs time and space. I think im depressed. Since july, i have started going to church again. Ive been in complete control of my anger and my attitude for 3 weeks now. With no outbursts. With no luck from her. She says she appreciates the work im doing for the kids. What should i do? I feel like im heavy. Its hard to breathe. I keep breaking down in the middle of work. Crying in front of my bosses. I have no clue where to go from here.

"Just moved for college, and I feel so lost. 
My sense of self is gone and I dont know how to regain it, I've tried to focus on my self, tried to take time to enjoy my own things. But I just can't, every time I try to do something for myself such as going for a bike ride my head gets overwhelmingly loud and it just becomes a chore. 

Previously I've managed decently with friends and others but with my moving its been difficult to keep contact with them, along with a recent relationship ending. It's all taking a big toll on me. Feeling disconnected from any support system and feeling completely alone. 

And I've tried not to rely on others to make me happy, but it seems I can't even make myself happy no matter what I do. Everything I've used to try and distract myself only works for so long.

You’ve had a lot of change in your life recently: college, moving, separation from friends, end of a relationship. These are major life changes that will naturally untether you from your sense of stability, and identity. Your sense of wellbeing and identity will return as you become more accustomed to this stage in your life. You are fortunate. You know how to form relationships with others, and how to practice self care. You are introspective, insightful, intelligent, talented, and personable. These are traits that got you into college, and that have served you well in life. Remember, other people that you will meet are also feeling untethered. Concentrate on being helpful to these people that are uneasy. A kind word, a smile, a small gesture can put someone else at ease. It will help you to escape your negative thoughts, and you’ll start to form connections and new relationships. If you go to YouTube and search “guided meditation for change”, you’ll find numerous guided meditations that will help you to navigate the changes and feelings that you are now experiencing. You will start to feel more at ease soon. You have so much to offer this college community that you’re now within. Just try to relax (daily guided meditation will help with that), and let other people know who you are. Be kind, and work hard. You have an exciting adventure ahead of you. You are very young, and you can pursue a life of deep purpose, love, spirituality, intellectual formation, and peace. I pray that you feel more at ease soon, and that you recapture your truly wonderful sense of self.	Masked_Freak	reply	na	na	na	0.9994739890098572	weak	no	no	na	depression_help
"The last week has been a rough one for me.  To preface, I'm very happily married and we have one child.  We've been together for almost 11 years, married for 6.

When I was in my late teens-early 20s, I had a relationship with a girl I was head over heels for.  We talked about kids/marriage all that.  When she started college it all suddenly changed.  She wanted to go on a break from us because she had feelings for someone at her school.  Over the next year she gaslit me, showed up at my house after christmas begging to take her back, then she dumped me 9 months later for the other guy.

It took years and a lot of failed relationships before I felt like I was finally getting some self-worth back, and my wife has never made me feel unwanted or unloved.

But this last week it feels like my brain is juat replaying all that pain from the other relationship over and over again. I know it's in the past.  I know I can't change it.  I know my wife is not that other girl.  But my brain is just trying it's hardest to convince me that just the other girl, my wife will realize I'm not her best option and just ditch me.

It's been a hell of a spiral and I literally just had to lay on the floor and cry.  Waiting for a callback to schedule therapy, but if anyone has any thoughts about what to try.  I'm just so tired of reliving something I tried so hard to get past."	CannibalDiveBar	post	25.113797800032003	male	White	0.9980792999267578	na	na	na	2	depression_help

It‘s excellent that you have scheduled therapy. When I find myself focusing on, or becoming obsessive about, past disappointments, there is always a triggering event. Therapy will help you to uncover your triggers. You are having irrational thoughts. You know this intellectually, but you’re having trouble accepting it emotionally. You had a relationship with a women who could not sort out her feelings for you. This says nothing about who you are, or your ability to give and to receive love. You are a wonderful and unique creation. You have thoughts, emotions, insights, interests, skills, and charisms that have won your spouse’s heart. She loves you, and you’ll have to accept the enduring truth that is uniquely offered in that love. Something that may help while waiting for therapy is guided meditation. There are hundreds of guided meditations on YouTube that can help you to better understand your mind, and to sort through false patterns of thinking. Search “ guided meditation” and select a few that fit your mood and practice. In the end, you are going to have to accept that you are worthy of a committed love, and that your spouse has offered that to you. You are blessed.

I'm drunk now. I'm going to be 40 soon. Still a virgin. No friends. I understand this is 100% my fault, but I'm getting to an age where it's hard to change who I am.  I'm no longer looking for friends, don't expect to ever have a girlfriend. What type of life am I living? I have a good job, that's the only thing that keeps me going. Otherwise I'm numb to everything. No longer sad about my situation. I go to weddings since 100% of my cousins are getting married. I see them with tons of friends. I don't have anything close to that. I've disassociated all emotions at this point. I can't kill myself since my parents are still alive. That would destroy them. I live every fucking day in this joke of a life.	iamnotbart	post	19.86646628624988	male	White	0.9984948635101318	na	na	na	2	depression_help

"I am sorry you are struggling with this.  Please go talk to a pastor or counselor right away.

First, you can change.  Anyone who told you that you are too old to change is a liar.

Second, what does being a virgin have to do with anything?  Only this perverted world puts such an emphasis on sex.  What is important in this life is not who you laid, but who you loved.  And contrary to Hollywood disgustingness, sex and love are NOT the same thing.  Sex is something two people who love each other may do.  But sex is hardly a prerequisite or requirement of love.   I would be more concerned with who you have loved rather then who you have slept with.

Personally, I would say loose the bottle, stop feeling sorry for yourself, and do what Jesus did:  Show grace, mercy, and love to those around you.  You focus on those things the rest will fall in to place.

Again, I HIGHLY recommend talking to a pastor or counselor.  God bless."	iamnotbart	reply	na	na	na	0.9984948635101318	strong	no	no	na	depression_help

"I had a bully in high school who always called me inferior, and I think he was right. 

 I see so many successful people my age and I just feel stupid. How did they achieve all that shit? Why don’t they have bpd? Why didn’t they fail and fall behind just like me? Im just inferior I guess. For whatever reason. My soul just isn’t worth the same as theirs. But I don’t know how to get there, I don’t know how to be better and successful. Even if I did I’d still be so far behind. So I should just accept it. 

I always thought life would be better. And I thought life’s purpose and mission would be becoming a better kind of person, ascending and making something useful to the world. But maybe I was wrong. And maybe life’s goal for me is just to come to terms with being subhuman and coping with that, in a healthy way. Anyone thought of this? 

I’ve just been calming myself down when I have a bad thought and saying that this is just how it is for me. Nothings gonna change so I might as well stay calm, the same way people in dangerous situations stay calm. I just don’t want to gaslight myself into thinking that I’m worth anything. It feels like lying.

You are wrong. You have inherent value.  Depression blocks you from seeing this, but depression can be beaten.

"let me start with telling you I get where your coming from a little. Currently my little brother is stronger than me by a hefty chunk and shamed me every day about it with his talk about me being weak. Now this use to not affect me, but after I struggled carrying my brother through my house halls it hits a little harder. 

Another time when I was younger, my brother shoved me off a boat in the middle of the lake because the girl he liked was there with some others and they said I was weird because I wanted to be with him. I just wanted to be with my older brother (I have 2 older, 1 younger). I swam for probably 15 minutes but eventually my little body gave out and I nearly drowned till my eldest brother and his friends helped me. 

Now it’s not quite the same, but I’ve accepted that I will always be weaker than others and be ditched at times, even by those closest to me, but I live knowing that that doesn’t have to affect me. I mean it does still, but less. I focus less on I’m a weak f**k and more on things I enjoy. I think less about how people can abandon me and more about who I want to be with now. Life becomes easier when you try to make it easier. A little effort with consistency helps too."	Peaceful_fish	reply	na	na	na	0.9883924126625061	no	strong	no	na	depression_help
"Hi, I'm 14.  
My neighbor is 13, and he is depressed.

I hope you're all doing well. I'm posting here because I have a friend who's been dealing with depression, and I'm really concerned about their well-being. They're already seeing a therapist and taking antidepressants, but lately, it seems like they're still struggling and have expressed thoughts of wanting to end their life or at least put an end to their constant sadness.  
  
I really want to be there for my friend and offer support, but the truth is, I'm facing some time constraints that make it challenging for me to dedicate as much time to them as I'd like. It's frustrating because I want to make a positive difference in their life, but I'm struggling to balance my own commitments.  
  
I'm wondering if any of you have been in a similar situation or have any advice on how to provide support when you're limited on time. Are there any small gestures or actions that can still make a meaningful impact without requiring a huge time investment? I want to ensure my friend knows they're not alone and that I care about their well-being.  
  
Also, if any of you have suggestions on how to encourage my friend to reach out to their therapist or seek additional help when they're feeling really low, I'd greatly appreciate it.  
  
Thank you in advance for your understanding and advice"	nnxfty	post	33.36070585628481	female	White	0.002300895983353257	na	na	na	3	depression_help

It’s important to remember you are not a therapist or a doctor so being that involved isn’t healthy for either of you. Your health comes first.  Distraction and self soothing are techniques to relieve depression, as well as going out there and doing activities. If you want to be there for that, that’s a great role for a friend to take on.	nnxfty	reply	na	na	na	0.002300895983353257	weak	no	no	na	depression_help
You are a great friend but your friend's mental health isn't your responsibility.  The things you can remind them of is their therapist and parents are there to help them. You also need to talk with an adult you trust to explain the situation you are in.

"First of all I hope you all are doing good and if not, I hope that you will get better soon… 
Anyway, I decided to join this server couse I think I have been trapped inside some kind of depression. I have not been to doctor, so I might jusy be sad for no reason, but its slowly getting worse. Like I have been feeling bad last year and I have been thru a lot of shit, at least I think some of it “count”. Anyway, all the bad stuff passed away, and now I am literally amazing with no need to trouble myself. But I am not, day after day its getting worse and I feel more and more awfull. I do not think I can stand it anymore.

And I think thats it, I am pretty insecure, because a lot of people betrayed me (not only on the internet, but mostly in real life).
And I also do not want to trigger somebody by my shitty stuff and idk, just bother and annoy them.

If is someone interested I can tell them the whole story and what exactly happend.
Or If somebody would just mind to chat with me, I would appreciate that. 

Thats all from me, wish a good morning, oh and in case I do not see you good afternoon, good evening and good night.

"Thank you for joining. You have a very sincere and positive energy even while going through depression. Please do yourself a favor and hold tight onto that. No matter how bad you might feel, if you can keep that positivity within you, it’ll help you get through anything in life. 

It might be something to consider asking yourself, while the bad stuff has passed on. Have you truly moved on from the bad stuff? Are you able to think about each thing and be at peace with what happened? Many times we feel time will heal on its own. Yet it can leave tiny bits of trauma still inside us, only for them to resurface as depression later on. Food for thought.

"Thank you buddy,
You are propably right, about the first part, but also about the second, I am trying to keep the mood best I could tho. Anyway, i have been in some pretty bad relationship stuff, where few girls treated me pretty bad and made false signals, one told me after first date, that she might be lesbian and after some time she told me, that I am just super ugly and that the date was awfull (I really tried my best with picking the place and stuff, tho I had a little problems with speaking, couse I was just a little nervous, but tried my best, she like asked my 1 think thru the date. Another girl (my old crush), have brung me in the SH and cried about how life sucks and promised me so many things, dates etc. We even dreamt about sex together, anyway she also gaslighted me, made just those false hopes and was acting pretty bad to me and stole my ig acc, with a friend I trusted. For another girl I travled to Ireland when I was like 13-14 y. o., and that just havent worked out, even tho we spent like 2 years chatting and having a great time.
So a lot of troubles with girls, I just think, its my fault after all of this, couse this cant be real, how many attempts I had and not even a kiss from a girl. I am just desperete and lonely.

Also thanks to my crush I started talking to her best friend amd she acted so nice, she said I can vent to her and she vented a lot to me and it was so good, but later on I borrowed her login to ig couse I needed help with smthing and there we go, she stole it. Also she is talking shit about behind my back (I was for a month in Ireland for a month thanks to school program, and she told everyone in the class, that I mentally abused her ((btw. The crush is from class too, and I really moved on, I cant even remeber her face now)) even tho, she vented a lot more and did more bad stuff to me and also rejected me, after I invited over my place and told her, that I might feel smthing towards her (I was drunk and sad). And she told me off pretty harsh. Anyway, she still acts how good friends we are and how much she love me (as a friend). Funny it is.

Also other classmates “friends” are pretty rude to me, I loved them always texted them first, I made the plans and events, I did everything. And with two girl “friends” we promised, that we will do smthing in the summer, couse we all have free summer, they did, but havent bothered to hit me up :(. All others do the same, and when I am in depression they cant do a sht to help.

TW:

So the girls made me a lot of trouble and brung me to the world of depression and trouble, and I was so desperate about that crush (we even went to dancing classes together and everything was great, but then she ghosted me and never talked to me again, for no reason at all). So I started after this SHing and it was pretty bad, many times I was unable to even use my hands, but still went to school and fight thru it (I am like best class, even maybe best student in the school, never had worse grade than A (not a flex, please dont judge me, just a thing to the story). Anyway, after some time there was a school prom ( not my grade, but we still went there) and I got pretty depressed and drunk and told all my friends, that I want to die so much and I told them a lot of times. And they did nothing and didnt even cared (they knew all about the depression and stuff). And there I drunk too much alcohol, I had like 4.5 promile and ended up in the hospital and passed away for a while too…. I was told, that I could have died so easily and that I was really lucky. Anyway, I tried few more suicide attempts and nothing worked… I am just tired of life now tbh.
I think about ending myself almost every say, and the thoughts are getting worse….

I think the depression is getting day by day worse and I am losing it, I just cant do it anymore, I am so tired and just need somebody to love and not be that lonely.

Also a more than year ago after some diase, I was told by the doctors, that I have also pretty bad blood and that I can die anytime. My organs will just colapse and I will die and cant do much about it, I am not scared of death, but actually maybe I am. It hurts to know, that you can die anytime…. 🥲



Anyway, I am soo sooo sorry for this shitty vent, I just  wanted you to see the whole story and all the consequences that have been happening to me. I do feel pretty terible, like I said no appointment at the doctor, but I just feel, that something is wrong inside me. And once again I hope you will have a great time out there.

I have been through depression in the past, but nothing this severe. I always knew that I wanted to live and always was searching for ways to make my life better. It did take help from a very good friend, who happened to be a Christian, to get me out of the house and out of that horrible mind space I was in. She took me with her to a bible study group. I didn't know anyone there but her. which was exactly what I needed at that time---to be able to talk out my feelings/problems with total strangers actually took away all those dark thoughts and feelings I was experiencing.

to get me to take over. The only reason why I chose dentistry is because it was the most logical decision for my future, not exactly because I “enjoyed it.” I honestly hate studying in general and I don’t grasp concepts that easily, I’m a slow learner so I have to do alot of extra work to maintain a decent level. But the thing that makes it so difficult is that I hate what I’m doing. It’s been 7 months into 1st year and im just trying to relive old memories and remember the good times before I joined this college… 

I just can’t adjust to the environment I’m in right now, I had an amazing friend group in 12th grade and I was really lucky to find them but now we have gone our separate ways.

And the people in my class aren’t my type.

 (I was raised in the uk so I just get along better with people that are nri because there’s no language barrier) 

I just find them selfish af and fake 

Also ragging here is a thing so that made things worse even though it’s over now. 

I also had a vehicle accident and missed a month of class so my attendance is now below the required amount 

The teachers teach in a different language in most classes so I just tend to zone out during lectures..

(I apologise for stating so many reasons but I’ve bottled this all up inside for more than 6 months)


I was a decent student in 12th grade (again I was lucky because of the reduced portions due to covid) but then as soon as I joined this college I’ve been having problems 

Are there any other career options which has a good value in India? (this is because my family won’t let me take a degree in commerce or any degree that isn’t as “prestigious” as a doctor or engineer according to them)


I’m struggling right now and I need help on what to do…

I just feel like i was trapped from the very beginning… all my parents care about is getting respect from others…"	Ok-Armadillo5547	post	13.726484485498496	female	White	0.9994901418685913	na	na	na	8	depression_help

Has anyone used FMLA through their employer to leave 1-2 days here and there for mental health reasons? I am about to start the process after nearly taking my life last night.

Sorry for replying late. Sooner or later, I reply for sure. Understandable.. it's hard and unfair. I feel talking about how you feel with your girlfriend will help. You can talk about how you feel about your addiction . She will find it good to know that she and the relationship is important to you and you are sharing about your.

I'm laid back. I don't do drama or stress. I just love my happy little life. I did. Everything was ok. Untill I realised my husband was emotionally and financially absuive. I didn't know. Weird to say but it's like it snuck up on me and suddenly I saw life wasn't that great. I was deeply unhappy. I don't have friends I only have my dad and I decided to speak with him. Except that week he had a devastating stroke. He's paralysed and in hospital, but he's awake and aware. His partner is an alcoholic. Now it's just me dealing with dad, looking after his alcoholic partner and trying to get to see my dad a 4 hour round trip away twice a week by bus when I work full time and have two children. And having to take his partner on the bus!  I also learned I have a condition which can make me lose my sight and I'm not on prednisone steroids and having to go to hospital one a week myself. I feel sick at the thought of my dad coming home because his partner can't look after him and he's so young to go in home. I can't take all this. I feel like my head is going to explode.

That’s honestly a lot, I’m so sorry. The important thing is that you can make it through, even if it’s gonna be hard. You have to focus on what makes you happy, your dads situation is rough but he would want you to be happy, just play it by ear until things develop. As for your husband, if he has not been supportive to you, especially at such a hard time in your life, you should definitely consider talking to him, working it out if you can I mean, because you definitely need someone who can be there for you right now.

"Weird but I dont know how to “heal” when my environment isnt really helpful, and when I also cant really afford to get professional help 

There are many things I’m trying to do to get out of my headspace like personal projects so I can heal but it’s difficult because I can’t “grow.” I’ve been trying to write a story and draw, but because I suck at both and don’t really have people who care enough to wanna help or hear about it, I’ve really got nothing to work with but my own thoughts on it, which is just limiting

It’s hard on my own because I already recognized that I don’t push myself harder because I feel like there’s no reason to. Why should I make a good story, and why should I make good art when there’s only me to appreciate it? That’s no way for me to get better at my craft. I notice every-time I’m about to put my mind into it, I stop and get headaches, like I dont even want to think about it. I wanna do them, but it’s like I feel like it requires so much work, and doesnt feel worth it and thats probably whats stopping me

Is it me, or is it my environment? I don’t know what to do. I seem to have knack for finding people who think I’m incompetent or have nothing interesting to give, so how do I get better at my craft when no one wants to help me with it? When it doesnt feel like something worth their time? I’m not going to pretend I know everything, I also need help. But is it me? I really don’t know anymore so I really would appreciate some advice here.

Thank you! I have friends, close friends, and family members I talk to! But it’s these same people I struggle with cause they’re all the same. 😭 The one friend I have that actually shares my interests I actually feel resentment towards, because I’ve spoken to them about wanting to talk about my stuff, and we’ve tried multiple times, but they always stop and never seem to put any effort into caring or trying to understand my work. I’m upset because this person shares my feelings, like they understand it completely but the difference is they have friends who actually put in the effort to help them, but it seems when it comes to me they don’t really want to. They have the time only to focus on their own and their friends’ works. And that’s what upsets me a lot. I’ve tried joining writing groups and artist groups, but I’ve encountered the same people. I have to be good enough to be able for them to help me, and with the artist group, I’ve had people abandon me for that friend I was talking about. Once they got to know them, they stopped talking to me. Idk why I’m just surrounded by this all the time, it does get hard to deal with.

Thanks for that! Yeah, I’ve been self learning everything so far, and it’s been fun but it gets discouraging when the people I approach for support don’t really seem to care about it. I have an artist writer friend and I thought I could approach them for help since they’re always telling me I can, but they always talk about their other artist and writer friends helping them and I think I just resent that somehow idk. I always feel like I’m not worthy to be helped or because they don’t understand my work or try to. I understand maybe they only have the time and energy to think of their own work, but it’s discouraging cause they made me believe I can do it, but they offer no real help or proof that they care about it. It’s stressful for me cause this is from a close friend of mine, and I just always feel this resentment creeping every time they come to me to talk about their character and story. It’s like. Great, youre having a great time, you’ve got people who support you, I’m definitely happy for you. But also it sucks to hear encouragement from them because I don’t trust they mean what they say cause theres just no effort. Just empty words. I used to be open about sharing these ideas of mine, but since I had issues with this friend since they abandoned on me once when I was in a bad place, I stopped believing again that anything I do is worth anything. I want to keep going and try to at least even if I don’t feel like I or my matters but it’s paralyzing when you’re stuck and not sure what to do and where to go cause everywhere I go and every person irl or online I happen to meet tends to be just like that. I don’t really also want to believe everyone is like that at least, but I’ve consistently just encountered so many with this attitude towards me and my work that it’s just almost convincing.

"I have depression since I was a kid, I'm now 29 and I'm just not getting better. In the past experiences, I haven't really had any good therapists, I stopped trying and basically just gave up on getting help. 

Recently, it's been harder for me to function normally, I have hard time working and sleeping and there's no specific reasons to my more depressed mood. 

A few months ago, I found a therapist near my place, I prefer in person meeting so the options were very limited. I went to see her, talked and felt better, but in the end of the session, she told me she's sorry she's still very new (2 years of experience) and cannot provide the support I need. She did explain why and told me I'd need someone more experienced. I understood but this made me really sad because it was easy to open up to her (it's hard for me to connect to strangers). 
At the same time, it made me feel like something is wrong with me that she didn't want to take me as a patient, this made me completely close up again.

Things got worse because my performance at work is affected, which makes me more depressed and stressed, I work from home so I basically wake up, log in to work and lay on the couch all day. I'd be rushing to complete work when the deadline is close, and I know it's terrible, I tell myself everyday tomorrow I'll be different but it's never different.

I'm tired of this, and I want to get help, but now I'm scared to open up again and get denied. What should I do? Where do I begin to find a therapist again, should I state my problems in the initial emails when I first reach out to them? I really can't take another chance of being denied and be defeated.

You many want to consider seeing a psychiatrist with the ability to prescribe a range of medications, and to inform you about new medical treatments for chronic depression. It took some time, but I found a psychiatrist, and eventually found a combination of medications and therapy that were exceptionally helpful. The truth is that some therapists are struggling with their own problems. The inability to treat you says more about the therapist’s deficiencies than it does about you. A therapist should not schedule a session if they are not capable of treating a full range of depression symptoms. Don’t lose hope. There is definitely a therapeutic approach that will help you. Persist until you find a beneficial treatment. I hope you feel much better very soon.	aivlys00	reply	na	na	na	0.995064914226532	no	strong	no	na	depression_help

I'm to scared to talk to anyone I know about it, they know I'm dealing with problems again but I've never given details. But my depression is back and it's much worse. It's much stronger and is effecting my whole body. I can't think straight, I can't enjoy anything, i haven't eaten and lost about 10 pounds in a couple days. Yesterday was the worst of it, it was the first day I wasn't scared thinking of suicide. I looked for options of how to do it, I wrote somewhat of a note, left a list of emails and passwords for whoever needed it. At one point i had a cable around my neck and I was at the decision point. I snapped out of my confused/delirious state and walked away. It shook me pretty bad, but hours later I'm almost in the most positive mood I've felt in a while. I can still feel it though, there's still a pit in my stomach that feels like it's lying and waiting. I got appointments set up but I'm just tired. I know it isn't instant help but my fight is low. I feel so alone in a house full of family. I think I've been using a girl I've been dating just to cover up the loneliness. I've attached my feelings and ideas onto her for my own benefits and I feel like shit about it now that I realize it. When we got to talking and she admitted she's not into it seriously and is dating other people it hurt pretty bad. I know she did nothing wrong but the ideas I put on the situation made it crushing. Now I realize how truly lonely I feel and it's embarrassingly crushing.
 Sorry for such a long ramble but I wanted to type it out and just say it for maybe atleast someone to hear. Open to any opinions or thoughts that anyone may have"	youngandbummy	post	18.541484485420227	male	White	0.17030669748783112	na	na	na	3	depression_help

I'm sorry for you pain and glad to hear you are talking it out.  Stick with your appointments (for a medical doctor and counselor)?  Those are important.  The good news is D&A can be treated effectively with medications and behavior change.  I'm a strong believer in the spirtual element, so get on your knees and pray for relief and good solutions to your pain.	youngandbummy	reply	na	na	na	0.17030669748783112	strong	no	no	na	depression_help
"I get it, I once had a knife to my wrist in the bath. I didn’t though cause my old dog was a good boy and could read a room. I got better after a while because I realized that I may not want to live, but others want me too. 
Now here’s the long part. 
*im the 3rd of 4 boys*
A few years later my dog died at age 7 and that hurt my family and I. A year after that I was getter better but my older brother(2nd oldest) who I had been tasked to watch when parents were away because of his severe depression, he did not seem to realize what I did. After school he made his attempt the few minutes I was away eating my after school snack. When I went up to go back to my task, I had a hell of a sight. I dragged my brothers near lifeless limp body through my hall and yelled for my eldest brother. My little brother had to see me drag him through the hall while he was told to call 911 which he couldn’t from shock. My eldest brother came and picked brother 2 up and carried him to the neighbors house for medical help (they are close and the mother is a nurse). We were outside while other neighbors came out to investigate the commotion or to attempt to help. He ended up being okay but has essentially ruined the past 7 months of my life. I haven’t slept, I can’t talk to people the same, I can’t cry for some reason, my brothers and parents have also taken a big hit too. I love my brother and wish he never did that. But most of all, I still wish my little brother never had to see that. I wish my eldest brother never had to pick up his little brothers limp body. I wish my parents never went through that. If I could go back, I would starve myself till I eventually died to stay by his side to prevent that from happening. 

My point is, people love you. People want you here with them. People need you to stay strong for not only you, but them too. Even if you find it hard to share, please, find a way for yourself and those you love. I hope you get the help you need"	youngandbummy	reply	na	na	na	0.17030669748783112	no	strong	no	na	depression_help
So not only for myself but my girlfriend as well. For me last year I left a decent job to one with better pay in a different field, I had issues come up with my pets which didn’t help my life stresses but at this point I wasn’t bad. Then I hurt my back, I go in for a few hours, can’t do the work efficiently so I head home, I say if I can come Tuesday I’ll be 100%. Monday I was fired, that Friday, I lost my mom. I didn’t have a job for over a month and no car because in the summer my car caught on fire. I find and take a job at minimum wage which barely was able to keep me afloat. I had toxic family break up my gf and I which were now back together and I have currently no contact with that person. I lost one of my cats who was always healthy within a weekend and 1500$ later I have his ashes above me as I sleep. We should’ve tried to stay at the apartment we had and make it work where we get back on our feet but instead went to her family’s house which hasn’t been easy to say the least. It’s become extra stressful for not only us but our animals at times. We both are working but are stuck with bills trying to catch up on besides being able to afford to survive with food  and so on. Without getting too deep into the home situation (not entirely my story so can’t say anything) it’s not a stable environment for us to be able to try to move forward and get onto better things. I’m 99.9% sure I just lost a great opportunity at a job because I can’t really afford to take a bunch of time off to come and do things whenever. I just want to be able to get a decent paying job and we want to pay our bills and move south so we can have more of a chance at having affordability in our lives as well as a better space for our animals which they deserve. I just want to be able to not feel like I’m drowning each day so I can go back to trying to become my old self	MrBigCookie	post	23.291140176621692	male	White	0.9972923398017883	na	na	na	3	depression_help

In the 2008 financial crisis my dad got laid off. He had 5 mouths to feed and couldn’t get a job for 3 years. In the 2nd year though he gave me the belt for being to breaking a tv. I was 4 1/2. I just wanted a nerf dart back to play with my brothers. After the event I cried to my brother whom I shared a room with apologizing saying “I’m sorry we can’t play anymore”. Now the point is, my dad has cried to me saying that is the thing he regrets most in his life. Even though you’re down on your luck, stay calm and push through. My dad was down on his luck and he let his problems get to him. Don’t let yours. I hope your situation gets better and you can stay on the path to get back towards your old self.

Currently as a fifth teen year old I am person who has been dealing with social anxiety and depression for many years so life is not always so easy for someone like me. I never really got a chance to experience what it’s like to have friends because I always had to stay at home. I have lost so many people in my life at such a young age. I watched my grandmother pass away and yesterday made it two years that she’s been gone. She was one of the people who raised me from a baby, someone I could talk to and she would listen no matter what, someone who was there for me when my mother basically abandoned me and it was hard for me to help dig a grave that I knew the next day she would be in and now my anxiety and depression is at a all time high to the point that I don’t want to go to school because I don’t want to be around people anymore because my mind has been trained to stay away from people I don’t know . I try to explain to my mom that I am going through a lot but she doesn’t really care that I’m hurting inside and therapy is not helping me anymore . I don’t know what to do this in my last attempt at help	Accomplished-Pie-869	post	25.05848311613585	male	White	0.9953843951225281	na	na	na	5	depression_help

I’ve been commenting on a few post the past hour about stuff and trying to help others. I’m going to tell you what I’ve said a few times before. 
I‘ve been there. I had reasons to want to not love anymore, but I had better people who wanted me alive than reason I wanted to die. So I don’t love for myself. I love for others. My younger/eldest brothers and my parents especially. If you don’t have people like that, they aren’t to hard to find. There are people like that everywhere and I hope you can find some or have some.

So so sorry for all your pain and sadness. So sorry for the loss of your beloved grandmother. You loved her so deeply and she was your friend, a safe place, the one who would nurture you and support you and cheer you on. It is a big loss. I understand that you feel hopeless. I wanted to offer a perspective that might help. If your grandmother was here, she would tell you to move forward. She would not want to see you give up or feel hopeless. She would probably tell you to try another therapist, to work with a new therapist until you found one that did help you, that you connect with. She would want you to live a full and happy life and make plans and live out your dreams. This is how you can honor her as she would want good things for you. You also might want to call your local hospital which has a lot of resources when you lose a loved one. There may be a support group that you can join so you can be with others who are going through the same thing. You may also make a friend or two there. I am sorry you feel that Mom is not helping, maybe she is struggling with the loss as well and isn't capable of seeing your pain right now. Maybe consider volunteering at an animal shelter, animals give you unconditional love and it is a good feeling to help them. You may make a friend there as well. Open yourself up to possibilities. Be gentle with yourself. Write your grandmother a letter, explaining to her the impact she has had on your life. Let this be a treasure for you always. Save it and read it when you need to feel close with her. You will feel her in your heart no matter how long she is gone. You have a new year of school ahead, reach out to the guidance counselor. Let your teachers guide you. Join an activity or club that you would enjoy. Try to be kind to yourself. Your grandmother will be cheering you on, you will feel her presence in your heart. I hope this helps.	Accomplished-Pie-869	reply	na	na	na	0.9953843951225281	strong	no	no	na	depression_help

I'm not stranger to pain. To disappointment. To frustration. I use to juggle so much more than I should have, but I guess that's what the numbness gives. I spent so long in therapy to get where I was after what happened to me, but I have never regretted that more than this last year. In the numb, the plate was never too full. It didn't matter that I have no friends or family that I can go to. Frustration never cause me to cry. Every day, every set back, every tear, I regret this. I miss the numb. I miss the girl that couldn't care that her life is lonely and crumbly. She could do it on her own. I guess I know that's not true deep down otherwise she wouldn't have gone to therapy and begged for relief so desperately. Is life suppose to be this unhappy or am I broken? Did I do something wrong? How was this suppose to be worth it?	savannahej	post	34.64381496327833	female	White	0.9989743232727051	na	na	na	5	depression_help

"Short version: How to work on self discipline so that you don't fall back in old ways/""lazyness"" even tho you get severely depressed in cycles+ADHD inattentive.
(Ideas on a schedule for example?)

Im at point where I just NEED to do better, I wasted 7 years of my life on opioid and stim abuse and previous 5-6 years on depression with an equally bad lifestyle. I live in a ""rehab"" with only treatment being urine tests. Can not work or study at this point which is my no1 priority.

I keep going thru this cycle:

1. severe depression, self hate, BDD to the point of not leaving my room. Extreme Social anxiety(probably due to my body dysmorphophobia) 

2. I get better one day and back to shit the next for a while, a week mby

3. It gets much better and slightly hypomanic sometimes I think. I feel like ""next time I won't let the depression take control over my actions""  and really believe it

 I start writing down good things that I try to do every day. Trying to adapt to future ""work-life comeback"" and just as I feel like I could start working again and feel functional it just goes back to stage 1..

They think I'm bipolar or borderline personality disorder. They have not been able to diagnose me yet due to former stimulant/opioid abuse(1 month sober) these cycles did NOT appear only after starting drugs btw

I don't know I feel like Im autistic to a degree too, especially the thing with eye contact and geeking interests to death:P but can just be my social anxiety and being an introvert talking..

 I have adhd, depression, general anxiety disorder and BDD diagnosed btw. 


I keep having ""relapses"" in behaviour and mood kind of like a bipolar, and I dont want to go so low in mood again that I fuck up my routines  or start doing drugs again."	Neurotrophia	post	33.67077423677872	male	White	0.9946640729904175	na	na	na	1	depression_help

"Hello everyone. 27m here. I was suicidal from 2020 to 2022. After a 3.5g mushroom trip I have not felt suicidal at all since then. I realized a lot in that trip, but most importantly, that no matter what happens in my life, I will make it through.

Yet I still feel pessimistic about my future at times. It's a habit I formed in the last 10 years while my life was falling apart and I gave up trying to fix it. I always lose hope and start to stagnate. I make progress but then fall off because I slip back into the mindset that I will never be successful anyways. At times I feel that there's no point to anything (not in the suicidal way). I don't want to think like this. I have a new life now.

I opened up to my family about my struggles a few months ago and they are 10000% supportive and letting me take my time to recover from my severe mental illness. They were not as supportive in the past because I never let them in. They always thought I was just being selfish but they understand my issues now.

With their support and my desire to grow, I still find it hard to get myself together and do what I know I need to. I'm still in that mental space where I feel too far behind. After talking with my Mother, I have realized that I am very hard on myself. I wouldn't even say I'm really depressed anymore (I still have a lot of anxiety though). The mushroom trip replaced my depression with appreciation for life.

But living life is the tough part now. No more escaping. I have to move forward and find peace. I find I'm stuck in my old habits that are ruining opportunities now. I have new avenues of life opening up and I know what I need and want to do. I do well for a few days but then fall back into self-isolation, comfort chasing, procrastination, escaping through social media and so on.

Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks."	garbaset	post	28.138020820028515	female	White	0.0019428550731390715	na	na	na	4	depression_help

Hi! I am sorry for posting here, but I have no one to talk to. I'm currently studying abroad and far from my family. I was not able to go home for almost 2 years. I have so much things to do, and I feel like giving up on everything. I tried to talk to other people, but I was made fun of because of feeling sad. I think they will not believe me, unless I am dead. Finally, I had the courage to go to a psychiatrist and diagnosed with depression. I just started taking meds, I was told it would take at least 3 weeks for it to work. I just to want to rest with my studies and just continue at home. I just feel that I am being shamed for being too slow, for being not good enough. 	waterlily_97	post	18.617396984373	male	White	0.9960325360298157	na	na	na	5	depression_help
"Hello, I know how you are feeling. But I am here to tell you that you dont have to feel that way any more.

I believe that the void that is missing is Jesus. He fixed a broken mess like and and I know he can heal you too. No matter what you have done or felt, nothing can separate you from the love of Jesus.

I understand. It must be hard. Studying and working simultaneously requires more effort. What helped me was to take a paper and write down 5 Most Important things of the day. Task one is studying ( I write down exactly what I need to do in studies) Two is the revision of the previous day. Three is my art Dancing ( 25 minutes ) Fourth is helping mom in household and Fifth is writing diary, my philosophy, using Reddit etc. It gives me more clarity. Of course the order is changed daily but it's one of the best tricks I ever found. What do you say? Don't set goals for others. Set for yourself, as per speed.

So today i was hanging out with my cousins, and i was going to vent to my cousin abour how hard my life is. I did. And i regret it. He just said, 'oh i have a harder life than you' And didnt even tell me why. And then he said: 'My cousin has a way harder life than you. His dad forcefeeds him and if he dosent..' Well  i said, 'You have no idea how hard mine is-' Before My other cousin cut me off. Remember when i said my cousins dont care abt me? I meant that. Like when I felt bad bc that SAME COUSIN said another one of his cousins is his real cousin, I tryed to beat that cousin at everything to show i was the superior option. Guess what? I FAILED AT EVERY, SINGLE, FUCKING, THING! And when he brushed it off and walked away, i could hear him mutter, 'Guess boys are better than girls' So i ran off to his room, (i was at their house btw) And just sat there and read bc i was used to being an outcast. Then my mom came upstairs and told me to come downstairs bc we were going home and i asked why. She said that when she asked my cousins where i was, they said'idk' like they didnt care. I was abandoned so many times in the past, i was just used to it. Used to the mental torture. And by saying other ppl have it worse than u, hes saying that my emotions arent valid. I basically show no sign of even being a bit sad about being abandoned, ive cried all my tears out for that situation. Ever since pre-k, my life seems to be going down a bad spiral. Pre-k, bullied and have one bestie. Kindergareten, (srry my spelling) has a toxic friend. 3rd grade, finds out that 'friend' is the only one i have. 7th grade, best friend abandones me for a more poupular girl. 8th grade, i now have to start all over with only 3 friends.

"So I don't want to diminish how you feel about what you're going thru, but I'm not the type to sugar coat things. In order to be diagnosed with those things you would have to be diagnosed by a professional therapist or psychologist, and they would prescribe you with medication for that. I have a lot of that myself. It's hard. I'm not saying you don't have those illnesses, just that you can't be 100% sure. I especially hope you can work past bulimia. 
I have a lot of the same thoughts of inadequacy. I won't say it ever goes away but it does get easier. Try to talk to your parents about it, and ask to see a therapist. School counselors are terrible at it, that's why they don't have their own practice. They're the most basic of basic in that field. You can also start the conversation with your counselor and ask them to talk to your parents for you in order to suggest therapy. 
You're young and a lot of things feel bigger than you can handle. Again, it takes time. You'll grow into a wonderful person if you just realize and take to heart that you can get past this, and take what you learn to be a good person and share your own experiences to help others."

"So my first question would be how old are you? Are you out of high school yet? Are you an adult?

I'm going to be honest with you, and I really don't mean to be rude about it, but it's going to suck to hear it. Everyone's problems are bigger than anyone else's. Humans are greedy by nature and will almost always consider their well-being above everyone else's. That's just human nature,  unless you have some mental scars. 

Have you gone to a therapist to discuss how you're feeling? Are you diagnosed with depression, ptsd, general anxiety, separation anxiety disorder,  bipolar, or anything like that? If you aren't going to a therapist, I would highly recommend it. 

As for friends, as you get older, you'll realize that having a small circle of highly trusted and supportive friends is WAY BETTER than having a crowd of acquaintances that really don't care about you. If those 3 friends you have now are truly your friends, you should cherish them. It's hard to find that."	MelissaGirl123	reply	na	na	na	0.999319314956665	weak	no	strong	na	depression_help

"First off, I want to say sorry for all the pain you endured, and the abandonment you felt in the loneliness that enveloped you for so long. You shouldn’t have too experienced those feelings, repeatedly, especially, I buy your own family. This is not your fault. You did nothing wrong. You have no reason to be treated disrespectfully and traumatized by anyone. I know the feeling of betrayal by a family member. It does hurt more minutes from someone you care about and are trying to build a relationship with and then to hear them say hurtful things about you and twist. Intern the story around. That’s called gaslighting, it’s win a verbal or physical emotional abuser tells you you’re wrong that didn’t happen that’s not true when it did happen and it is true but they convince you that your reality is it what do you think it is. I know people think like well. How can that happen? That can’t really happen I mean that’s just crazy. It happens because it’s daily it’s over and over. It’s all the time and it’s twists and turns and ups and downs and job scene kicks in every direction and eventually when you’re already susceptible do you just warning to not get another argument so you just agree or you try your best to make them seem satisfied and then you honestly don’t know what’s real and what’s not anymore. so you’re family should be building you up and encouraging you being a Outlet and support system that you know is there for you need it. I would encourage you to distance yourself from everybody and anyone who treats you poorly who makes you feel bad about yourself, who makes you feel inferior and smaller and less than they are, and I would highly recommend that you do some journaling and express your feelings, and start talking to yourself in a positive direction encouraging yourself, and every morning I would encourage you to wake up and first thing you do is look in the mirror and tell yourself I am beautiful I am worthy I am strong and I say those until you believe it and then add more to it. I am self-confident. I am proud of myself, I am happy and then just go again say it again every morning.

That in itself is not going to do what you need done. Do you need a therapist who can get to the core of your problems and help you go back and feel those feelings and heal through them, and let go of them until you do that until you go through that process of feeling the emotions that you’ve had, we have emotions so we feel that it’s OK to feel our emotions, until you do the work and get all of them all the negative out and gone through and understanding it and have tools to work on processing things next time you feel that way the next time something like that happens you’re going to keep getting hurt you need to definitely find a therapist. I have major depressive disorder and measure anxiety disorder, and I have a whole list of things, it wasn’t until I was started dealing with the pain in the emotions and the feelings I had very down deep inside, everything started to get a little bit lighter and a little bit brighter.

"...where to begin? (forgive me for any errors as english is not my native language)

I have recently (less than a year) discovered that most of my adulthood biggest problems come directly from suffering from depression. I lost my father to cancer back in 2006 when I was 18 years old and truthfully I haven't been able to recover from it and mourn to this day. My life has filled with regret from the past, my personality took a massive left turn from a friendly, relaxed and outgoing guy to a sedentary, complicated person and an introvert. I moved away from my home country with my girlfriend 8 years ago so I'm also away from family and friends. I work in video production and editing so it's very demanding and I need to be sharp to do it well but these fast few months I've been forced to step back from projects and decline other jobs just because I'm not performing at my best and can't  concentrate to do the most basic tasks.  I'm also not doing well financially and feel I have just way too much on my plate right now. Sometimes I tend to feel I want to not be here but then I think about all the harm and pain it would bring to my loved ones and it's probably the only thing that deters me from taking action. Also, my girlfriend suffers from OCD and the last two months have been an absolute hell with depression, panic attacks, constant weeping. She had to quit to her job due to this and it has taken its toll on our relationship. My girlfriend is currently going to therapy and I was too but it came to a point where I just feel I'm not moving forward or making any progress. I just feel very very lonely even though I'm not alone."	timmy_jimmy	post	29.07103256202748	male	White	0.9971298575401306	na	na	na	3	depression_help

"Brother, first thing I want to say is I know where you are coming from. I used to have that void in my soul also. It’s weird because no matter what I tried to fix it with it was always just a distraction and not permanent. I then discovered Jesus. Now im bot gonna lie and say if you too discover Jesus that everything will magically disappear, because it wont. But it will fill that void in your soul if you start having faith and believe in Him. Just give him a chance to work and show up in your heart and I think your void can get filled. No matter your background, what you have ever done, or what you have ever thought or felt, Jesus will forgive you because He loves you. I know you probably are going to think Im crazy but that is OK. But please at least give it a try. Just say “Jesus, I don’t know why I am feeling like this or why I have so much pressure around me. But please help work my feelings out and please come into my heart and change me fr the inside. Please forgive me and all my wrongs and please lead me into greener pastures. I trust you Lord and thank you.” 
Sorry if I cant give you any non-religious answers to your question, as Im not qualified to do so. But please give Jesus a chance, and I believe he will change you like he changed me.

"I've been in therapy for a while and after a few years of working on my boundaries, my husband has now started to become upset with how I interact with both his family and mine. 

Just as a quick catch up, I grew up with a narcissistic mother who was physically and mentally abusive. I've now started to confront her more about her attitude with me and her views on other family members. I don't do this in a mean way. Mostly just comments like ""have you looked at this situation from this angle?"" Instead of just keeping my mouth shut like I used to. 

Now I don't want anyone pushing me around or crossing boundaries with me. I point out to my husband when his mother does it and how I want us or just him to talk to her about it because it's making me upset. He's saying I'm overreacting and I'm becoming unreasonable in my requests. To give an example, my MIL knew about my treatments way before I was ready to share, thanks to my husband outing me and forcing me to tell her everything. Now she feels like she needs to give her advice and not in a helpful way. She'll say stuff like ""I've met your mother and she seems too nice to do/say any of what you're talking about. You need to just get over it and have a relationship with her. She's your family"". She grew up in a very stereotypical Christian household and never had an abusive or absentee parent. 

I'm not sure how I can hold up my boundaries while also not rocking the boat with my MIL and husband. My husband sees his parents through such rose colored glasses and thinks everything should be a pass because it's said with good intentions. I've been gaslite my entire life though! Comments like these are not helpful and mess with my head.

When you are a feeling, caring, loving person like yourself, loss is especially painful. Sometimes pain serves a purpose if we process all of its dimensions, which you are doing. There are excellent guided meditations on YouTube that can help you to process the loss of a relationship. If you search “guided meditations for breakups”  on YouTube, you’ll find some helpful resources. As time passes and you will enter into new relationships, and these feeling will diminish. You deserve to be with people that make you better and stronger, not people that bring you down. It took enormous strength to end your destructive relationship, and you did it. You have the strength to move past the pain. You have an incredible life ahead of you, process the loss and move into that life.

Work is going badly - to the point they've extended my probation and every email from my manager seems to highlight what I've done wrong/should be doing that I'm not. Husband is upset with me (in general) for ignoring his needs. Money is tight and I just want everything to stop. Doesn't feel like the antidepressants are working anymore. I just don't know what to do anymore. Every small light spot is followed by further darkness. Feels like I can't get out of it. Tried so hard to be positive about things but there's always another example around the corner to show me how shit I am, how I'm a failure. I just can't love myself. It's so hard when everything in your mind is telling you not to. That it won't get better, that it can't. I just don't know what to do.

"Has anyone else experienced gatekeeping from their therapists? How do I deal with it? I'm currently really angry and frustrated because both my social worker and psychiatrist aren't allowing me to try out new meds or won't refer me for more intensive therapy options that I really feel I need, based on arguments that don't make sense or wrong pre-conceived notions. For example they say it probably won't work anyway cuz they think I'm not open enough to it. Shouldn't me saying I wanna try this and that be enough, without me giving them a passionate essay about my hopes and dreams for miraculous results? Also considering I haven't been interested in any new therapies for lack of hope/energy/motivation for so long, I thought they'd be happy that I'm finally asking for something. Instead they're just making me feel like nobody can help me anymore, and regretting once again that I didn't go through with killing myself.

"While I may not know your exact situation. Perhaps you might look into taking this new motivation for healing in another direction. By this I mean if you aren’t getting anywhere with asking for other therapies, you might look into the things you can begin to control of your own. The simplest thing to start with is your physical health. So eating well, drinking water, sleep quality, and daily habits. These are things you can do to help yourself and your healing journey. 

Again, I’m just a stranger on the internet, however it might be helpful to be more open with your psychiatrist. They may be terrible at their job, I don’t know. However they might see these new therapies as non-beneficial if you haven’t fully committed to their therapy. Just ideas for you to consider.

"There are good periods and there are bad ones. Sometimes, I feel like everything is okay until, in the next moment, the way I view the world changes, and I can barely function in my day-to-day life. I am trying. Having routines helps to make my environment reliable. I try to go to the gym and eat healthily. I also strive to keep my room clean and go for walks. I have a timer set for when to take my iron substitute. I want to maintain control over ""it,"" so I don't succumb to thoughts that I know are not real. I'm genuinely putting in effort.

I experience moments of happiness and am aware of my ability to enjoy life. I know there's a somewhat healthy version of myself – the person I could be if I weren't struggling with my mental health. I'm curious about my potential if I could be that person all the time. My illness doesn't define me, and I'm doing a relatively good job of not letting it dictate how I live my life. However, it certainly influences the way I think, feel, and perceive the world.

During ""normal"" times, I see possibilities and view life as an active experience. But when I'm struggling, it's as if a switch in my head turns on, and suddenly life feels sticky, clinging to me like a layer of sweat. I become passive and try to keep up, all the while feeling mentally and physically unwell. I know it will improve and eventually subside for the next ""good"" period of time until ""it"" returns.

I dislike how people often fail to recognize how challenging it is to keep up, but at the same time, I don't want them to know. There are those who believe I'm exaggerating my struggles, those who offer unsolicited advice assuming they know better, and those who simply don't care, hoping I'll manage so that I can continue being a good friend.

I think the most difficult part is seeing the pity in their eyes. I don't want pity; I want to be heard and my efforts acknowledged.

At the moment, the only person I feel comfortable talking about all of this with is my psychiatrist, and I'm incredibly grateful for having this opportunity because I know I shouldn't take it for granted.

(btw I cried while writing this and it felt very therapeutic haha)

I'd love to hear your opinions and personal experiences. Thank you for listening :)"	No-Machine7377	post	28.689321198120794	female	White	0.005285814870148897	na	na	na	1	depression_help

no one will understand that im not mentally capable of doing anything requiring effort at this point  my mom swears I should be able to do school because ""I seem happy playing video games"" like yeah because it doesn't require me to do anything and it's a distraction
I feel like the only way to just get a break or get away from all the stress of school would be either dropping out (which my parents would absolutely not allow) or getting myself sent to a fucking mental hospital or something which cannot under any circumstances happen

Not much advice.. just solidarity. I’ve been there. My grades tanked. I was hardly sleeping. I never communicated with my family at all, I would only come home from school and go straight to my dark room to dive deep into the internet where I could find distraction. Just know that what you’re going through is so so hard. But it won’t be like this forever. Life has so many different seasons to it. And even this will evolve and become something different. I’m not just trying to say “it gets better!” Because honestly, sometimes it doesn’t. It certainly doesn’t feel like it. But life changes, and so do we. We grow and become more able to handle things. That time of my life was by far the most difficult thing I’d ever gone through, and yet that was the time my problems were most downplayed because I was young and in school. Hang in there!

"Im 16m turning 17m this year. I have some friends in my current school, and i am doing the ib diploma programme. However i constantly feel empty and dont see a positive future, and pondered suicidal thoughts like, ""what if i just k*ll myself after ib?"" or ""I should just j*mp, my life is meaningless and nobody loves me either way"". Part of my reason is due to how my parents dont really treat me well as a child, rather they are really strict and expect me to be smart, however i am not that diligent. I am also constantly reminded of being weird in my school, some even just calling me a*tistic or r*tarded, which doesnt help at all. My depression occurs occasionally, especially at night, when i ponder about my life. Other than that, i dont really feel depressed in school, more so of a state of tiredness and just getting through the day. If anyone could tell me what to do, pls do let me know what course of action i should take, because right now i just feel like nothing matters anymore, i dont see any qualities in me that really contributes to society, rather i am just a nuisance to my parents and this world."

If you don't feel you are able to join a peer support group or seek a therapist, maybe make a list of the barriers between you and getting those those things set up for yourself- then you could work on finding a way around those barriers?

"I commend you for reaching out and asking advice/help.  Seems like a SMART move to me.  Additionally if I am correct the IB program is harder than a High School degree.  And is accepted globally.  What's not smart about that.  Take pride in this.

Weird in school?  Bullying sucks and is often done by people who are insecure and want to pull you down to their level.  Don't let them.  Ignore them as they will not be around after you graduate.  

Get help with your depression, it can be as simple as talking to you doctor to see if they will prescribe meds.  No shame in this, as I have used them for decades, and I have a good life.  I would see a counselor/therapist to process your feeling.  Exercise even if you do not feel like it.  That helps as well.

Meaningless?  You are only in high school, you have plenty of time and are still developing your self.  Volunteer somewhere, this is meaningful activity and makes you feel good.

As for the parents.  Have you talked to them and told them that the pressure and lack of love has you depressed?  It may not change, but worth the try.  Forgive them anyway as a lack of forgiveness breed bitterness and does not help depression.  

And let's just say for a moment you are autistic.  People with A are often really blessed and smart at something special and may not be school subjects.  Some corporations are looking for these types and they think out of the box and maybe really good at programming or other things.  Celebrate this as well and figure out how to leverage it.  I saw a lady who could look at a maps taken years apart and could point out the difference immediately.  She works for the government in some type of surveillance.

"So I’ve been in a relationship with a person suffering from mild depression for five years. Because of several events (family issues, death of beloved pet, daily job related issues) her condition got worse two years ago. We soldiered on and I’m as patient and supportive as I can be. Now she’s in professional treatment but it’ll be a long way still. She initiated a conversation about ending the relationship since she “can’t give me what I deserve from a relationship”. Primarily she meant things like showing affection (emotionally and physically) and she’s not sure if it’ll be like back then ever again. I mean it has been like that for two years now and I’m willing to wait it out but it comes with a emotional toll for me as well. We really love each other and don’t want to give each other up but I have the feeling that she could initiate that conversation again. It’s a fucked up and complicated situation.

Now I’m just interested in experiences of people suffering from depression themselves or being / have been in similar situations. Can it get better maybe even back to a functioning relationship? Did you overcome similar struggles? What are your stories and what were your feelings?

 I just want to understand better since I can’t not suffering from it myself.

Well, having depression and being in a relationship is very hard. I’ve tried with some relationships, I’ve never reached the actually dating point. Just talking stages because being depressed, many often feel like your gf does. Not being able to give their best, give what’s required in a relationship. Should always respect what your partner wishes, in this case… wait for it to come up again. Even before it comes up again, you can bring it up if it’s heavy on your mind. Make sure you both fully express your thoughts. Each situation is different and every persons depression is different. Yes me personally I avoid getting close lIke that because of those doubts I hold within myself. i don’t want to tell you what she could be thinking because it can very well be wrong. Just express all you can and tell her you’ll help her. If she persists on ending the relationship, can’t fight that. Even after the breakup it won’t be the same. Takes you both to be strong.

"I believe you can work on anything and improve things if both of you are willing. For me the guilt of burdening someone with my depression is what triggers the same response as your gf. I don’t think ending a good relationship because of that is right. So she must be honest with herself and reflect on if she only feels like she wants to ”free” you or if she feels like the relationship itself is too much of a stressor and is affecting her healing. It’s a tricky question because having loving relationships is crucial specially to people who struggle. You need to do the same kind of reflecting, really think about what are your non negotiables aspects in a relationship, is this affecting your well being too much, what are you willing to do to improve things. You both should discuss these together. 

I feel like it’s a good idea to make a plan on how you will be taking part in her recovery, because in my opinion you can’t just passively wait. Obviously I don’t mean that I think you don’t support her. The plan should include concrete things that you can and are ready to for her and things that you can do together. This can be as simple as you will take a fifteen minute walk together every day. Maybe write down some things that she learns in treatment and you remind herself of these regurarly, this is a vague one since I don’t know what kind of treatment she receives but for me it would be that my so has a list of coping skills for panic attacks and shows it to me/tells me to do them when I need it. If you want your relationship to work you need to fully commit to being a vital part of her treatment. Of course don’t burn yourself out and remember to keep yourself well, it is not selfish to take care of yourself.

You could also make a similiar plan regarding the relationship itself. What are things you both agree to try to do etc. They can and maybe should be really small. Also this is obvious but constant and open communication is a must. Regular ”check ups”, discuss what she needs, what you need, how do you see this situation, has things approved, what works/doesnt. Even though depressed people usually don’t believe when someone says they’re not a burden etc it is really important still to hear that and be reassured of that regurarly.  

Depression is a really difficult illness and can worsen quickly. You have to really think about what you can handle so it doesn’t get to a place where she really needs you and you can’t take it anymore, let me tell you that is the worst. That’s why those check ups are important too. 

There is no waiting out, you need to be active. Both of you, if being together is what you want."	Pea666nut	reply	na	na	na	0.013398557901382446	weak	strong	no	na	depression_help

Hi, you can call me Herbie. I’m a 15 year old gay person living in turkey. I have had homosexual instincts in the 8. Grade. I was not so confident so I told about it to some people, I thought they would support me. But they didn’t. They hated me and would constantly threaten me to tell my family about it. They forced me to do things… Finally in an act of desperation, I resisted. They formed false accusements of me jacking off at school. Every goddamn “human” in school believed it. They accused me of being a pervert. I have told my family about false accusations, my family came to school but they made fake proofs. My family believed it. Even my own family didn’t give a shit about me telling the truth. From that day they have used this “incident” against me a couple of times. at that time my habit of wearing mask on public places was started. I was so afraid of somebody recognizing me. I had anxiety crisis’ about being recognized. They kicked me out of school, not on any documents but they said that i can’t go to that school anymore and they would have to “report me” if i didn’t got out of there. On the new school I would not really speak. I would just speak in classes and never really talk on breaks. I don’t know if they have ever seen it but at that time I was devestated. I had to wake up at 6AM to make it in school which started at 9AM. I am still suffering from that event, after moving out to high school i would tuck my privates in so that they don’t see me as a male even though i don’t identify as so. I did not eat anything at school that year. I was constantly starving to the point that if i drink water i would feel the liquid coming into my stomach. Even some of the guys in class told me that i looked yellowish and pale. I just can’t forget that thing. I am not what they think! I tried to commit suicide a couple of times, yet i failed. My friend saved me calling my family. I’ve told them it was a prank even though it was not. I can’t even cry, i don’t remember the last time that i was happy before that. I focus on my art and i literally work until i’m dizzy/sleepy because if i don’t the trauma of the incident just pops in my head. I just can’t take it anymore.

The first thing people usually struggle with during depression is memory, followed by concentration and then sleep.

Past mistakes and wrongdoings can then be viewed as misaligned coping skills or responses to trauma. By grasping this perspective, we come to realize that our inherent purity became encased in protective ego layers over time. While the ego may have served us in our youth as we navigated the world, our personal growth has since enabled us to evolve. Our identity isn't fixed; it can adapt as the world around us changes, granting us profound mental liberation. Dwelling solely on the past hinders progress and can lead to stagnation. To move forward successfully, we must avoid fixating on past events. Understanding that even 'monsters' were once victims, and recognizing that their anger stems from normalized experiences imposed on them, allows us to perceive one another authentically. We emerge as mere pinpricks in the lampshade of God's illuminating presence, artificially separated yet intrinsically interconnected.

I am in my late thirties. I am working with a therapist finally because I was forgetful for a long time and now sleep issues interfering with work. I moved away, I got an 8-5 job, I am working with therapists now and on medicine for an expected amount of time to be a year-ish. I do not want to be on medication, but I do need help badly. My point is, get help. You know the issue. Seek help and take action steps on improving your life.	Aggravating_Taste821	reply	na	na	na	0.9991050362586975	no	strong	no	na	depression_help

"I (18f) am going through one of the lowest points in my life.

My dad started drinking heavily 5 months ago, and afterward it became apparent that he does not like me as a person, at all. He hates that I'm queer, autistic, atheist, etc. He constantly criticized me simply for existing. He doesn't do this to my brothers, or my mom. Just me.

all of my friends left me, except for one, and i dont want to constantly rely on him. when all my other friends left, i was devastated. i still have no idea why that dont want to talk to me. it's made me very angry and cynical, but i try not to take it out on other people.

i feel everyone is against me, and im going to be alone forever. i hate myself so much.

I've always struggled with sh urges and disordered eating. With the sh urges, I've never cut. But ive come close recently, and the only thing stopping me is that i lost my blade. This is my go-to, and i dont want that to be. i need advice on releasing these feelings and coping, without harming myself.

has anyone else gone through a similar experience? how did you deal with it?"	arloofc	post	13.748160151107282	female	White	0.9925560355186462	na	na	na	4	depression_help

"This is just my personal opinion and experience so just take what resonates. I know that everyone struggle differently and have different circumstances. I dont know what you are going through or understand fully but if this sparks a glimmer of hope or love in someone's life, it would be more than worth it for me.

I realised that there is a pattern in my life that Im making, its that I keep running away from situations. I keep quiting jobs, quitting schools, and running away from social interactions.  I kept giving excuses on why I did what I did. 'Oh its because im protecting my mental health, people are exhausting and fake, I dont vibe with those people, its because the work is a dead end job, I dont see myself in this field of work in the future', and so on. 

Since I was so busy distracting myself with my phone and music every waking moment, I didnt have much time to reflect, think of this pattern in my life, seek help from people and solve the problem instead of blaming on others and myself. I just thought that I was socially inept, an incapable person and was just fundamentally unlovable.

But do I really want to be this way and feel like this for the rest of my life? No, I want to have hope for the future and not dread everyday. I want to be proud of who I am and have a fulfilling life with people I love. I have been feeling so stuck in my own negativity loop that I couldnt see much hope and that this is all there is to my life. I would just live a depressing life till I die. Others are living happy and contented lives while I am somehow an anomaly that lives a boring and depressing life. 

Then I went on Tiktok and saw people that are positive and inspiring, that are actually so down to earth and loving. They have people that they love and love them in their life. That was what I wanted. Then I saw that they were proactive in their lives, they ask people to hang out with them and not having so much negative self talk to the point of isolating themselves. They try to talk to people and not just stuff their ears with earphones when being around people. Their hearts are open to people and experiencing the joy of being with people. It was nice to see life from their perspective, everything seemed more alive.

I realised that there are so many kind and loving people out there. Its just that I keep focusing on the nasty people that disapointed me in the past that I eventually gave up hope that I can connect with people and share love with others. Sure, there were bad people but so were there good. I have a good heart and I am a nice person that genuinely wants to love people so there are also people like me out there. There are 7 billion (or 8 idk) people, so it wouldnt be possible to have only one kind person that is you. Genuine kindness and love still exist. 

Ive read ""Man's search for meaning"" by Viktor Frankl initially for my depression but I have found so much hope that even in the worst circumstance, it is when people's nature and love really shine through. Even in such dire circumstance, people help, support and love each other. It is who they are and people dont just show people niceness to get something out of them. Yes, some do but others are genuinely loving.

Even if I currently dont have people that I am close with, I believe that I would meet people in the future that I can form close bonds with. Also learning to be proactive and knowing that rejection wont kill me helped me a ton. So what if people dont like you or ignore you. I can let go and move on with my life, there are other things that are important. I can choose to dwell and focus on the rejection and failure or I can just shrug it off, tell myself that its alright and Ive done a good job. 

$$Ive read ""7 habits of highly effective people"" and applying the 1st habit of being proactive already changed my life for the better. Star Jesse Taylor on youtube have also helped tremendously in this. I have reached out to others, I am starting to learn cycling as an adult, learning gymnastic and yoga (I am doing these because I want to and for myself, not because of impressing others or for the sake of having a hobby so I am deemed a more interesting/worthy person). I have always feared that I am too old to learn cycling and I am too embarrassed to even admit it, so dont even mention learning it. But screw it, I want to learn what I want, not by how others judge and think of me. I feel awkward and embarrassed dancing but I have always admired dancers and the way they vibe to the music so I will try it out even if I look silly and weird. I saw the gymnast doing their thing, thought how I wouldve loved to also learn gymnastic but Im too old for this but who says? I learn what I freakin want. I am asking my classmates I lost touch with to hang out even though it is uncomfortable and awkward as hell, I think they might not hang out with me cause I seemed aloof back then, and I might or might not get rejected. But at least Ive tried and wouldnt live with the what ifs in my head 10 years later when I am lonely and friendless, thinking what I couldve done now.

But what if things turn out well? What if future us were glad that we took a leap of faith to get the life we want? I am proud that I am brave and courageous to live out the life I want instead of caving in to fear and doing what it tells me to do. Its either you act or be acted upon. Don’t wait for things/life to happen to you and hope that it turns out well. Just do what you want, dont overthink it. Make your actions/what you do based on what you value (relationships, health, love, etc) not based on avoiding emotions or thoughts. Ignore the uncomfortable emotions and thoughts if they dont align with your values, they would be there for sometime because you are stepping out of your comfort zone. 

I want to live life knowing that this is the best that I have done, I couldnt change anything in the past because young me didnt know better and did what she thought was best. Its alright because I know what I can do now. Just let go what you cant control and see what you can and do it. Its ok to feel fear and negative emotions, take it easy, baby steps. Be loving to yourself like you would to a friend you love. Try to be empathetic, understanding, encouraging to yourself. Say loving and encouraging things to yourself instead of critisizing yourself. See that you are trying, see what you have done well, and give yourself praise that you have done a good job. Love goes a longer way than criticism. It fuels and encourages you rather than drain you in the long run. I love you guys and i believe that you guys can do it :)"	Regular_Skill_4635	post	21.30238152324115	female	White	0.0021540175657719374	na	na	na	1	depression_help

Im 16 in highschool and i feel alone. In 9th grade i had friends lots of friends and i had a perfect girl who waa short with red hair and during the end of my summer into 10th she broke up with me. Most of her friends were my friends so i just stopped talking to them and pushed them away and lied to them during my 10th grade year. Now im a junior and i regret everything ive said to them and done. I lost my insta account and when i got it back i had to refollow everyone including me ex. So i tought ill send her a message saying sorry, for not being me. But i tried to follow her and she declined my follow. Now i feel even shittier and if i try to talk to anyone they just kinda say that sucks. Now at night i sit alone in a dark room and cry, but not sniffling or flowing out tears. All that happens is one or two tears fall from my face every 3 to 5 min as i think abt her and where i went wrong. Ive never had to deal with this much sadness and it hurts so much and idk what to do to make it stop, i want to feel like me again.	thatonechairslave	post	19.887788513382823	female	White	0.997795581817627	na	na	na	2	depression_help

"Sorry, I don't know how to explain this properly, but
Why do I just function when there is a thing coming, like if there is nothing scheduled, then I won't get out of bed?
For example: 
If there is a class on Tuesday at 1 p.m., then I stay in bed until it is time to get up and prepare to go. It seems like I just exist if there is something scheduled first, if there is something that I have to go to, or if I simply cannot get out of bed to do anything.
I have noticed this pattern for a while now, and I have tried to make plans and keep myself busy, but I just cannot do it if it is not compulsory.
Please tell me what is wrong with me. I have been dealing with severe depression for nearly 8 years now. I have been on medication for 1 year, and I just gave up my medication for nearly a week. I really need some advice, please.

"Depression wants to keep you in bed. It’s safe in bed where you feel you can’t be hurt. Many of us battling depression go through it so you are not alone. I’ve been through this myself a bunch. Only recently getting a good grasp on controlling it. I know it’s hard, however one way you can over come this is by making rules for yourself. Whether that’s scheduling more things in the morning, not allowing yourself to snooze your alarm, going for a short walk every morning or doing some push ups, and the one I found most benefit from is when I first get out of bed to shut my alarm off (I leave my phone across the room), I quickly make my bed so that I won’t allow myself to crawl back into it. 

Whatever you want to try. So long as it directs you away from your bed. Physical activity is generally a great place to start as it will get your blood flowing and heart rate up a bit to help wake you up and break out of that feeling of going to lay in bed and into getting ready for the day.

"I just started a new job at an ice cream shop and I have to stand for 5-6 hours and it gets pretty busy. 

I was fine the first 3 days but had to call out on my 4th because I got a sinus infection from the freezer. My arms hurt really bad when I twist them a certain way and I cut my fingers on some metal. It sounds bad, but that’s not what’s actually bothering me. 

What’s bothering me is the insane amount of burnout that results from this. I already can’t sleep and get restful sleep, but this job on top of it (which I have to walk to sometimes) makes it even worse. 

I have cried from the amount of pain and burnout I have and I just want to lay down and sleep because I am so tired. I can’t seem to enjoy anything because all I can think about is “okay work is in a few hours.”

I just don’t know what to do. My head feels full and I slur my words. I feel full in my brain. I can’t think. It’s not normal to feel this way and it’s frustrating because every adult  around me just says “well you’re not used to working. You gotta build it up.” But it SHOULD NOT result in this near panic attack inducing state of mind. 

I just want to cry. I just don’t know how I will be able to get through this. With the physical pain and the burnout, I don’t know. 

I’m looking for remote jobs as much as I can hoping that one will give me an opportunity so I can get out of this. 

If anyone has any tips for dealing with this kind of physical and emotional pain, I will gladly take them because this isn’t normal. 

And it’s not me being lazy, it’s me having a severe mental illness."	LavenderPierrot	post	24.035001399340796	female	White	0.998940646648407	na	na	na	3	depression_help

I’m truly sorry that you are in physical and emotional pain. You deserve better. You are definitely not lazy. You took an extremely demanding job. Something that helped me to slow my mind, organize my thoughts, create a roadmap for my future, and improved my sleep is guided meditation. YouTube has hundreds of guided meditations for almost any emotion that you are feeling. If practiced every single day, guided meditation can change the way that you perceive the world around you. There are also sleep meditations. There are apps. like Headspace that can also be useful. Hopefully the sinus infection can be effectively treated, and the aches and pains diminish with each passing day. You have a lot to offer this world. You have insights, interests, talents, skills, and charisms that can be used to benefit this hurting world. You have an incredible life ahead of you. Right now you just need the tools to help settle you, and to improve your mental health. Try guided meditation and see if it’s a helpful tool for you. It takes some time to gain the full benefits, so stick with it each day for at least two weeks. I pray that your life gets better with each passing day.

"Thank you, I fell off of meditation. I use the app Balance because of how personal it is and right now I have a free trial that will expire soon. Hopefully, I'll make enough money to be able to afford it, if not, youtube, like you said might help.   


I hope I find some that are personal enough to comfort me because a lot of them feel generic or something that puts me off.

I've tried tons of meds nothing worked, they never kicked in, only thing that works is benzo which calms me down only temporarily but even with that I need highest doses to feel like myself, my last resort was getting ECT but my psychiatrist refuses to perform it , I wake up with heart palpitations everyday, I'm anxious 24/7 it's like my brain is constantly on fight or flight mode, I can't take naps even if I tried to,  I can't leave my bed to brush my teeth or take a shower , my heart is beating fast all day long, it's been like this for the past 4+ years, I can't live like this , this is living hell, I have to kill myself	sadtillitkicksin	post	6.646025704704481	female	White	0.9987552165985107	na	na	na	21	depression_help

Get a new psychiatrist who is willing to use all tools in the treatment arsenal. ECT saved my life twice. Yes; there are risks and memory loss--that's why you can't get it unless you have tried just about everything else.

At times, the most effective way to offer assistance is by reminding individuals that their identity and ego are shaped by their environment. Past mistakes and wrongdoings can then be viewed as misaligned coping skills or responses to trauma. By helping grasp this perspective, they come to realize that their inherent purity became encased in protective ego layers over time. While the ego may have served us in our youth as we navigated the world, our personal growth has since enabled us to evolve. Our identity isn't fixed; it can adapt as the world around us changes, granting us profound mental liberation. Dwelling solely on the past hinders progress and can lead to stagnation. To move forward successfully, we must avoid fixating on past events. Understanding that even 'monsters' were once victims, and recognizing that their anger stems from normalized experiences imposed on them, allows us to perceive one another authentically. We emerge as mere pinpricks in the lampshade of God's illuminating presence, artificially separated yet intrinsically interconnected.	sadtillitkicksin	reply	na	na	na	0.9987552165985107	no	no	no	na	depression_help

"What is ECT?

Depression medications never worked for me as well. Some had no effect, some made me numb, some made me feel like shit. but they are not the only option. I went on a Ayahuasca retreat a few months ago and it helped me tremendously. Although it´s not a miraculous cure for depression, it gave me a new perspective of life.

"To start, I’m too much of a coward to contemplate hurting myself, so I’ve basically just given up on myself instead.

My relationship hasn’t been going well the last year. We lived together and have a dog, who was diagnosed with cancer at the start of the year. A month ago we finally called it quits, I couldn’t handle being with someone who had clearly checked out. Since he moved out, It’s been incredibly isolating and lonely in our apartment on the edge of civilization. And then I found out our dog only has a few months left. 

Since then I’ve basically been a wreck. My ex has tried to be supportive but I can’t rely on him anymore. I even begged him to come back, I wish we’d just worked through things, but he doesn’t want to come back. Makes me feel even more pathetic. On top of it, work is as busy as ever and I have a ton on my plate. I like my job but it’s overwhelming how much is expected of me now for a lot of huge projects.

Everyone tells me to move on, find hobbies, distract myself, but none of that is working. I am devastated. I want my ex back, I don’t want to lose my sweet dog, and I wish I could unload work from my plate. It’s all starting to feel like too much to handle alone but I have no remedy. Idk what I’m looking for here, I guess just to hear from people who have persevered and can give me some perspective."

Hey, sorry to hear you're in a tough spot.  I settled for the status quo for years. My advice to you, as painful as it is, would be to move on. Things weren't great before, and some of what you miss is great individual times. Unfortunately, when you are depressed it is just sk hard to have any MOJO. I get that. Totally.  The truth is that you may need to reinvent yourself a bit, but it gives you the opportunity to do it your way. A new life awaits and you can  be free of depression.  It is not easy, but it is possible. Please  don't take this the wrong way. I can feel your pain right now and that Totally sucks.

It has to start with small things first, but also a true desire to make changes. First comes self care. Proper bedtime routine, showering, tooth brushing, making yourself a priority.  I'm not judging.  I struggled with all of these. You have to force yourself,  even if you don't want to. Next comes some kind of activity. It can be small. Something you will like and be successful at. Building a puzzle, learning to garden, etc. Exercising is huge for body image and hits you with the good neurochemicals. For me though, reestablishing my faith was the big winner. The most important thing is to try and be kind to yourself.  You are not nearly as bad, worthless,  or hopeless as you feel right now. That's the depression talking.  I'd be happy to chat if that would help.	KitKatGal2021	reply	na	na	na	0.9989055395126343	weak	strong	no	na	depression_help
"My life isn't too bad, but I have a really bad habit of being critical and I have a genuine hatred of myself. From how I look to basically how incompetent I am. I do chronic eczema all over my body, and people have constantly criticized. I know it's not as bad as cancer or something but my self esteem is non existent and I've been socially isolated for years. It's getting worse the past few years and it's stopping me from doing well in my studies because I'm cynical and I believe I'm incapable of anything. I can't talk to people, I usually freeze up and just stare at people.  I assume everyone I meet doesn't want to talk to me or assumes I'm dumb. I'm currently a clerk at a hospital and looking at the everyone around makes me feel even worse or incompetent. I can't even do a new basic task without tensing up. The nurses and residents

Ugh on feeling so down right now.  I feel for ya.  No you should not accept this as status quo.  Maybe try to revamp things a little--- take a walk on your break at work--- get out of the building or change your scenery for 30 minutes or so.  That truly helps me.  I remember at my one job... I needed to remove myself from the computer-- coworkers not that friendly, and remember just going walking up and down the stairs a few times to get some exercise and listened to a good podcast.  The city not the safest to walk in so I did that for a bit.   Maybe ask one of your coworkers if they want to grab lunch or dinner after work sometime.  Have you talked to your family doctor about feeling so low?  If not, put that on your list to make an appointment.  Does FB have a local group you can join, book club, running group, pickleball teams.  REach out and be bold to make a change.  Make small intentional steps to change how you are feeling and to get help if needed.

I have had everything handed to me and I have nothing to show for it. I have guitars but don’t know a single song, I try to play drums but suck no matter how much I practice. I’ve tried blacksmithing but can’t make a single thing. I cans my drive or work because I’m 15 and everything I try to do just ends up failing.

hi, i'm 16(f) and i've stalked your profile, i know it sounds odd but i couldn't help it, i saw your blacksmith works and i think you're amazing. having the guts and self-perseverance to pursue something you like is a thing i value a lot in life. it's a thing which you seem to have, and i hope you won't ever lose it.

i'm also pursuing hobbies like watercolour art, cosplay, prop making, song composing and voice acting. as niche as these hobbies and skills may seem to be, i still will continue to do so because i enjoy them. and i think you should do so too. please don't give up on the things you love doing.

a little heartfelt tip from me, maybe take on some customized commissions if you want to make money but cannot work on part time jobs. maybe sell some of your crafts on shopping websites or to folks who are interested? :D"	Me_is_a_Dum	reply	na	na	na	0.9995005130767822	weak	no	no	na	depression_help

I'll start off saying I know I'm not special in this hell we live in, we're all in shit. For once, I'm tired of being the light to others, never wanted this gift of being overly helpful, kind.  But, now, I can't help myself. My whole life's been chaos, alcoholic mom who'd leave us for hours, sexually abused as teen, had my 1st baby with an abusive ex at 17, misscarried one, multiple attempts of him tryin to kill me, even while pregnant. He abused many drugs. I always worked since my girl was born, left him after yrs of abuse, not afraid to die. Dated after, raped once, drugged. Met the best man in the world after....he was shot, almost paralyzed, still his caregiver after 23 yrs. Oldest daughter special needs, lives with us, attempts at suicide herself since she was 10. Lots of family who raised me, now gone. My sweet dog of 16yrs gone in feb. All the extra crap of life, work, $$$$$=none, etc. I've always been the strongest, the most positive, lifting others! & now, I'm honestly done. I'm tired of this life, all I want is to sleep & be done...can't leave my loves but I'm so damn torn!!! People are more hateful now! I'll probably have to work till death, where's the bright side of the life!? Once we leave, we're all eventually forgotten? This isn't the life we're meant for? Can't be.

"I yet again am in a place where I am going to quit drinking and doing cocaine. 

Every time I drink I tell everyone who will listen about this imaginary ‘beef’ I have with people I mixed with when I was young, unfortunately these people now also happen to be very very deep in gangland culture and drug dealing. 

I then have 2-3 days of chronic anxiety and the only thing I can think is that it’s because I must have this fear of being tracked down and embarrassingly beaten up, making me look weak and therefore vulnerable to more attacks. It makes me think that I would then not be able to protect my wife and she may leave me. My friends may lose respect for me. Il lose confidence and spend my days in embarrassment. 

My friends have recently started to tell me that they think I may need help, it’s like I’m trying to destroy this incredible life I have built with the same old habits. 

The hilarious thing is that I’m now in my thirties, I have a high paying job, a nice house, a lovely wife and yet I’m stuck in the same mentality I had from growing up in a rough area. Drink and cocaine seem to be the go to for any night out and has been for years so that just fuels the anxiety and pain. 

What’s more, is do you think these people will actually ‘come and get me’? Plus if they did, I might actually be able to win anyway or cause them more trouble than it’s worth. What am I so scared of? I am petrified of being weak and vulnerable. 

I’ve decided that I want to join an MMA gym and really get deep into fighting because I feel this would give me structure and help me feel safe, and that I can protect my loved ones. 

I just wondered if anyone can relate to this?"	GregBule	post	28.382313729190958	male	White	0.9931928515434265	na	na	na	2	depression_help

At times, the most effective way to offer assistance is by reminding individuals that their identity and ego are shaped by their environment. Past mistakes and wrongdoings can then be viewed as misaligned coping skills or responses to trauma. By helping them grasp this perspective, they come to realize that their inherent purity became encased in protective ego layers over time. While the ego may have served us in our youth as we navigated the world, our personal growth has since enabled us to evolve. Our identity isn't fixed; it can adapt as the world around us changes, granting us profound mental liberation. Dwelling solely on the past hinders progress and can lead to stagnation. To move forward successfully, we must avoid fixating on past events. Understanding that even 'monsters' were once victims, and recognizing that their anger stems from normalized experiences imposed on them, allows us to perceive one another authentically. We emerge as mere pinpricks in the lampshade of God's illuminating presence, artificially separated yet intrinsically interconnected.

"I am a 26 yo Indian male living with my parents. It’s almost been 1 year and I have failed again to launch my startup. Every time when it seems that now it’s gonna work people start leaving. I haven’t earned anything in a year. Previously I was working in a startup and they also betrayed me by paying the least amount of salary. I don’t have any savings. Started a startup with a friend and they betrayed me. Again started with a childhood friend and at the end moment he betrayed. I’ve been trying to start a startup ever since my 9th standard and since then I’ve avoided any kind of distraction whether it’s parties or a relationship. Battled cancer in between. Lost the person who was my biggest supporter. 
I don’t want to be a burden on my parents. I’ve always helped people and not for something I’ll get in return but cause they needed help. I always lose. I am just tired now, don’t want to live.

"Long story short.  I'm a 28 year old M brain cancer survivor, also medicated bipolar II. After years of treatment, I met a 20 M Canadian femboy on Reddit and fell in love long distance. I have a bad habit of long distance relationships. 
After 2 years of video calls and messages, I save enough money to visit him for the first time. Within the week I was there I fell deeper in love, and felt happier than I'd ever been. Almost as happy as when I was an innocent child. It didn't matter that three fourths of my family thought I was a disgusting sinner, I was head over heels for my soulmate.
But today, after waking up to my partner crying, he told me he didn't think we were compatible and needed to break up with me. Now I'm sitting at the airport, speechless. In shock. I went from living in heaven to right back into my depression filled life.
I don't know what to do. I literally thought I'd finally found it all. And now... I'm lonelier than before I met him. 

I honestly just.... I can't. The world is so much shit. So much pain. And for what? People leave me, weather friends moving away, lovers breaking my heart, family I'm close to dying, and pets I've loved going. All to live in a world filled with hatred, anger, fear. No job prospects. I don't even know what I'd do with my life past tomorrow. 😭😭"	GMapper14	post	26.666942111304948	female	White	0.997285008430481	na	na	na	2	depression_help

"I feel like I am circling the drain in the last 24 hours. I made some major mistakes that makes me fear if I am going to be homeless and how I will survive. I am also isolated and lonely. I never fit in anywhere.

My mental health has been declining. I can't calm my anxiety down. I can't sit still. I can't distract myself and focus on healthy hobbies. I can't sleep at all. The loneliness becomes unbearable. I keep thinking about how I was so optimistic 12 years ago when I started my mental journey. It was full of new beginnings, new people, and new possibilities. My life has been a total shitshow since about 2015.

"I cried infront of 42 people..
Today my English teacher made a session -a session in which she talked about depression.. ACC. To her depression a 15 year old teenager can't have depression.. she think what a 15 year old kid can overthink..
She asked the class - what is depression ( today I was not feeling well, I am having a seasonal depression) so I raised my hand and told her depression is when you think you don't worth anything you feel low , you friends make you believe you don't worth anything. No one tries to understand you.. with a heavy voice .. the whole class was impressed by my answer..she was also impressed by me. Then she said that asked the class who is depressed the most- everyone said my name..
She said my friends will tell my good qualities.. and my strength.. my friends told me my good qualities and strength.. I started crying immediately - because I worth a lot but still I can't understand myself... 
She asked the reason ; and because of me she told me  and the class about her struggle.. that life is tough but you have stand well.. then I also told her some of my points why I am like this ;
( she is soo funny ,but the funniest people are the mostly depressed) Charlie Chaplin was the most depressed person on this earth and he expressed all those things through his comedy, same applies to me and her).
My conversation with my teacher was emotional, I cried hard she cried also ...
You know the problem of us people is not that we can't express the problem is no one try to know us.. they think she is funny how can she be sad.. no sad part is in her life.. ..our friends poke us they taunt us they tell us we don't worth anything.. they say it without knowing that this affect us so much, they think they just said a joke but in real life that isn't just about joke... My voice is so beautiful, I believe it but many people told me that my voice is like crow and now I hate my voice - I want to sing but I don't.. i never tried to participate anymore thinking people will make fun of my voice we are not perfect.. I am beautiful - my friends once said that I am not beautiful, don't call yourself beautiful.. and now all the insecurity that was never ,now exist - I am beautiful,but my friends made me realise that I am not , now I am finding reason why my friends said it now I slowly started hating my nose, my skin texture.. someone said I am fat- I stopped eating for 2 months... Tell me who gave them this right to say about us this.. who gave them this rights????? Who are they to say something about us?? I am beautiful my voice is pretty - who are you judge and tell me that I am not?? Who are you and why you do this?? Do you know how it affects us.. do you have even a idea??? This isn't my fault this is their fault.. what my situation is because of them.. people say write you securities and burn it but tbh this never work, now daily I wake up and I see my insecurities and think that I will make changes in it.. but I can't.....

 I'm gonna try to keep this short bc no one will read this anyways, This all started in 2019 When I found I was the black sheep in the family at least my dads side anyways, once I found out the whole story of why I'm the black sheep I start to put all the pieces together and realize why I was never treated apart of that side of the family and it kinda broke apart of me realize why the cousins I grew up didn't even know I their family member. Around this time I was a bit down I then started to smoke weed telling my self its all for fun trying to live the high school party life trying to get that bit of dopamine I could to feel good. Fast forward a few years I stroll by 2020-2022 with just no care at that point till this year 2023, that's when I really see what I'm missing out in life because I took a trip to my moms side of the family and there and then I already felt like wanted there and not like a black sheep . I'm one to admit during High school I kept my friend circle small and I still do which has been falling apart from the start of this year, making me realize I'm even more alone than I was. Earlier this year I lost my job due to me having my weed pen on me at work, then I almost lost my dad by putting my hands on him because he screamed at my mom which ill admit I was in the wrong partially for laying my hands on my father, then I hit my first panic attack which freaked me out to the point I believed I was dead in that moment. While this unfolds in my family my friend group is falling apart because my a couple of my friends decided to get in relationships and just completely cut contact, now at this point we don't go out anymore due to the fact the other friends don't want to be out with out a big group so now I just stay home most days and go out like if I need to run an errands. So in summary I used to have fun times but now my life consist of staying in doing absolutely nothing. Now I all I always think about is starting a new life where my moms side is so I could be next to people that actually care for me not saying my parents don't and I just want more people at the holidays like a real family not just me and my mom even though I love her to death , I just want to see her happy with her family and not here alone while my father is out with his side of the family having a good time while were home alone on the holidays.

I'm  really sorry that you've  been going through this - sounds like since 2020.  It's  not going to change unless you ask someone local for help, like if you spoke to a social worker/counselor/police.  In California we have WEAVE (Women Escaping a Violent Environment) and law enforcement would probably have resources too (safe places to stay, necessities).  You could find a 12-step meeting or church in your area for support until you can break this environment.  It sound very toxic from your post history.

"Anyone know of an in home dematting/detangling service located in D.C? Or any detangling products? I’m dealing with severe agoraphobia and depression which has caused me to give up on taking care of myself especially my hair. I have dealt with hair care issues since childhood but the last two years it got progressively worse to the point my hair feels and looks like one giant dread. I’ve had this happen two other times but I got it out on my own. This time around I’ve made very little progress I get frustrated and start balling my eyes out each session. My scalp has so much tension on it it’s causing headaches and balding. Last week my hair developed a mildewy odor from not fully drying on the inside and the smell won’t go away which has never happened throughout the two years. I’m desperate to get this giant mass out but I can’t bring myself to shave it I refuse. A dematting video from love518 salon popped up on my tiktok fyp but Hadassa is located in Miami so I’m curious if there’s any salons or services in dc similar to hers? I have severe agoraphobia so an in home service is ideal but I’m willing to try going in person. I want to purchase some of 518s detangling products but her website is currently down so any product suggestions would be appreciated! I have curly hair if that matters. I’ve gone through countless products and broke multiple combs I’m desperate. If I get this mass out I plan on rocking Dutch brands for the rest of my life to prevent it from happening again😅

"I have long wavy hair and had a similar situation when I was drinking heavily.  I had to cut it in the end, but not across. If you point the scissors towards your scalp and do some snips inside the matt, and after each snip try and detangle with your fingers.
Then I covered it in conditioner and did as much as I could with my fingers. Combs and brushes just make it worse when it's this bad.
Then I would do the vertical snips with scissors,  and sometimes have to just chop out a knot. I repeated all this until it was clear and the good thing about having long hair is nobody can really tell,   because you can put it up.

Will doing the scissor snips cause uneven layers once the knots are out? I’m fine with that honestly, I just want to know what I’ll be working with if I’m able to get it out.

Yes you will end up with some uneven bits, but if your hair is anything like mine you can't tell. If you had fine straight hair it would be different! Plus you have the option to put it up. Sometimes just one snip can release so much tangle for your fingers to work with.

"i recently just got back from a dentist appointment, i havent been in one since 2019. my family isn't well-off. here's the thing, i suffered a lot emotionally during 2019-2022 due to family issues and betrayal so i really couldn't take care of myself that well. but i tried really hard. i even started working to help family with bills and stuff.

the dentist told me i had about 10 cavities i need to be filled. it's going to cost a lot. i don't have enough to pay for it and i talked to my mom and she seems distressed. we have so much to pay for. i know i'm burdening her.

i can feel a hole at the back of my front teeth. i don't want my smile to be ruined ofcourse, but i also don't want to trouble my parents for the money.

Hey, 37m usa…due to multiple reasons I suppose I have terrible teeth. I have brushed everyday off my life but they just keep getting worse. I haven’t smiled confidently in over a decade. It effects my life in every way. Some days I’m even embarrassed to be with my gf for her… but I need thousands of dollars of work. You sound like your in a little better shape so let’s start with that. With it can always be worse right? Your teeth can look like mine! Lol jk the university suggested was great. My only advice is do what it takes. Get on a plane, save up for as loooong as it takes. Doesn’t matter how long, as long as you stay dedicated and get to the end zone you’ll always be winning. And you’ll never be broke because what you are saving is something that has a price but is “priceless”.

Depression is painful, I know. I have been in this situation for a long time. The most important thing is not losing hope. Life is a cycle, it will go up and then down and up. How far up, how far down, nobody knows. when you are down, keep telling yourself, this too shall pass. it might be difficult to see the light at the end of the tunnel when you're really down. But the truth is there will always be light if you look hard enough. We only live once, like it or not this is the only chance we have to experience whatever this life offer to us. Practice gratitude, cherish whatever small things that make your life pleasant. Live one day at a time, don´t worry  too much about what the future holds for you because we can only control the outcome to some extent. don´t be hard on yourself if you can´t control the outcome. Some people control the outcome better, some people don´t. It´s nature. But in the grand scheme of things, life has its own plan for everyone. We shouldn´t run away from that. When it is heavy on the chest, take a deep breath. Observe every breath that keeps us alive. What a magnificent miracle our human body is. we often forget how unique and special we are because keep thinking about how our life should be and get disappointed when it is not how we wish to be. Make small steps to make it better every day. If you can´t on some days, be kind to yourself. Treat yourself like the person you love the most. Life will eventually turn out to be beautiful.

"I created this account with intent to write every vulgar/perverted thought I would have. In the moment I didn’t realize, I was just walking on this path of self destruction. Not just by this Reddit account, but also my lifestyle. I stopped working out for over a year. Smoked like a chimney. Been eating like a pig. J***ing off like there’s no tomorrow. Binging shows like my life depends on it. Missed showers, missed feeding my dogs, didn’t pay attention to my relationship, distanced myself from my friends, work productivity is obviously on the tail end of the spectrum. I need to fix this.
A lot of things have happened in my life over last 2-3 years and I can sense where all this has triggered from . They put me in more like midlife crisis mode I think. But it’s too early, I’m too young for this. I want to have a family which is not dysfunctional. I want to lead with an example of strength and self belief and give hopes out.  But it feels like the journey is too long and I’m all alone.
I met a therapist and I will continue to see her. Conversation with her made me feel I’m becoming slow at comprehending and not able to hold a decent conversation or explain my thoughts. Felt really shameful and disgusted. I’m not the version I ever thought I want to be. 
I hope it’s not permanent irrecoverable damage. I don’t want to stay in this envelope of self pity. I need to be out of here. There are good things about me. But I want to look at things that are bad and work on them and make myself better. I don’t want to spend time that feels like an eternity self loathing or empathizing with my setbacks.

Hey there, sounds like it’s been a slow spiral down but you’ve got some motivation in there to change. My suggestion is to not take on everything at once - pick small goals. Feedings with the dogs should be a priority, and making sure you’re getting proper sleep. Maybe a realistic goal for next week could be reach out to someone you haven’t spoken to in awhile and try to get in 3 showers this week. If that’s too much, something more attainable - just avoid taking on too much.

If you don’t feel depressed then why see a psychiatrist? Why go to the doctor? Depression also effects people differently.

At times, the most effective way to offer assistance is by reminding individuals that their identity and ego are shaped by their environment. Past mistakes and wrongdoings can then be viewed as misaligned coping skills or responses to trauma. By helping them grasp this perspective, they come to realize that their inherent purity became encased in protective ego layers over time. While the ego may have served us in our youth as we navigated the world, our personal growth has since enabled us to evolve. Our identity isn't fixed; it can adapt as the world around us changes, granting us profound mental liberation. Dwelling solely on the past hinders progress and can lead to stagnation. To move forward successfully, we must avoid fixating on past events. Understanding that even 'monsters' were once victims, and recognizing that their anger stems from normalized experiences imposed on them, allows us to perceive one another authentically. We emerge as mere pinpricks in the lampshade of God's illuminating presence, artificially separated yet intrinsically interconnected.

"A year ago or less I decided to rented my house, and try to make a new life and try to make a new life in a new city. But I got here I got robbed and I kind of got over it and wrote it off to being in a new place. I worked to get over it and tried to make the best out of a bad situation. It was really hard meeting people here and I ended up eating a nice girl, we broke up like 3 weeks ago. Since I just been on my own, it was my decision to break up she drank a lot wasn't very honest. So I've been on my own... After some time I decided to make a bumble date.
Last Friday I meat a girl and her friend showed up to acompany her I accept this pretty normal as we had a bit of an age difference she is like 25 and and I literally just turned 41. We were having a good time, and decided to come back to my place, I made cocktails and I don't remember anything after that. I woke up at 4:00 a.m. to find my place robbed pretty much everything, apart from my passport and my dog. I'm a permanent resident in this country so I've spent the past week trying to get new immigration cards, we should be available tomorrow. My family sent me some cash so I'm not completely on my own and are sending a new laptop, so I can work. But this is absolutely purgatory in hell, thankfully one of my friends needs a roommate on the other side of the country I'm going to leave this apartment. I've already paid some forfeiting 6 months of rent, but if I stay here I'll probably end up dead. I can only take so much this year I've been robbed I believe like six times, two times identity theft, a tendant robbed one of my properties. And now this.... It's horrible I can't believe somebody date rape me, I didn't get raped but I got robbed. If I can get all this paperwork sorted tomorrow I should be able to get out of here by Wednesday and I have a friend who needs a roommate and the rent is cheap and I know people in that area but right now I don't know anybody, I don't know if I'll be able to get out of here by Wednesday. It's just purgatory I don't want to buy food for the kitchen because I know I'm leaving. It's just terrible I hate living here anyways and to leave like this is just the worst this city has taken my integrity from me, I don't even want to see another person I can't even explain this and I didn't do anything wrong. I'm thankful I'm going to see a friend, but I'm scared about driving alone and there's no way I can do about it I just need to man up and get it done. It's almost 2:00 now, like just need to make it through the night find something to eat, watch something on Netflix and just trying to relax my brain but this is just horrible. I feel like such a failure I I should have left here a few months ago I internally knew it, but I really wanted things to work with my ex. I know I'm repeating myself but geez, I spent like 2 months and a half I'm kind of recovering from the relationship and then went out and got drugged and robbed. 
Why do people do this to others they have no idea what I'm dealing with anyways, for this to happen now is the worst thing that could ever occur. I've spent the past 3 days just lying in bed staring at the ceiling trying to sleep, just trying to make it till tomorrow... I need this immigration card I hope I get it tomorrow, they say come back on Monday to pick it up. I need to be with people probably this isn't good if I have to do longer than a few more days of this, it's going to be scary it's already been scary and I've already been through the darkest moments in this apartment that I'm leaving behind. But not right now was something that I could never anticipate. I don't know what I'm supposed to learn from this situation, I feel like this was like a test for me to go through my deepest fears ever and I'm literally just lying in the bed trying to make it to tomorrow to get to immigration. I'm scared about to drive I'm scared about my future, things are going all right before this I was battling depression but now this is like next level. I just need to get to my friend and out of here as fast as possible"	Delicious_Sherbet652	post	21.30277495499913	male	White	0.9994068145751953	na	na	na	5	depression_help

"I understand in some way how you feel. The past year has been hard. Robbed, beat up, strung up on fake charges. Gaslit, denied help. Shoved into psyche wards for little to no reason. Possessions lost or destroyed. Lost my apartment. Friends left. The people that stayed would torture me. And more.

The only thing you can do is get out, start over and forget.

"Yeah if I went into the entry he sees of some of the things that happened this year you won't even believe it. But I'm not staying here I've packed up most of my things... I just need this card from immigration I hope they give it to me tomorrow, it's crazy I need to sit with refugees from all around the world. I've been living in this country 8 years. I have a friend I'm going to go live with I haven't had a roommate for years, the rent is super cheap so letting the rent go here is not the end of the world. But you're right like if I stay here I'll end up dead.

Like half of me is really excited to get there and be around another person, the other part of me is like I don't know how I'm going to act around another person cuz I've been kind of isolated. But it's a good situation I'm going into in terms of making change and moving into the right direction towards like being happy I guess.

I can't sit here it's absolutely misery like even right now I can't think of anything I would do if that situation having occurred I'd just be sitting here anyways thinking the same thing but now it's compounded from that last from getting f****** drugged and robbed, I'm 41 in good shape and this happens what the f***

Just wildly I can get up pack a couple of things and then I got to lie down cuz my energy just sucked out of me, within the next 48 hours I should be able to load my truck and get out of here. Then I'll just drive like 14 hours to get to where I'm going I should be able to do that one day.

Don't know what I'm supposed to learn from this whole situation coming here, I should have left back in May I internally new it but I didn't act on it. I guess I just wanted things to work out with my ex and I all went to s*** right after that. It's like going back with my tail between my legs and a little bit."

"I have been in a 5 year relationship with a married man 20 years older than me from ages 18-24 with whom I had sex for the first time. Prior to that I had one adventure with a guy 14 years older than me that I met on an online chat. After the married man, I was with a girl my age, who felt like first love does I suppose, who happened to be an alcoholic in denial, from ages 26-28. Shortly after that I met a girl who I felt connected at all levels - intellectually and physically, not sure if emotionally I’m not sure I know what that means -, and it ended badly. She had somebody else and pretty much laughed at me and then ghosted me as if I meant nothing. In her words, “to not hurt me”.

After that, I went downhill and entered a depressive episode. It’s as if I had lost the joy to live. Before I felt I had forgiven my parents and had compassion for them, nothing hurt too much because it was understandable and really not personal at all, but then my inner world turned upside down and I feel a lot of resentment and so much pain. I also feel empty and as if there was a glass, a veil, between me and my experience. As if my life wasn’t my life. I feel very disconnected from the world and other people, as if I didn’t belong to this world and I didn’t belong to me either. Like an alien. This is too painful, confusing and hard for me. I feel really lonely even surrounded by people. I feel apathetic as if nothing was of relevance any more.

I also thought I had a happy childhood but I think I was actually in denial. All of a sudden I find myself replaying certain experiences in my head. For example, the night my brother said to my mother to “watch out tonight because I have a knife”. I fell asleep facing my mother’s room door to make sure she was okay. I basically held her hand and took her upstairs so she felt loved and protected. Or when I was playing Lion King on my dad’s back and I hurt him (on purpose I think, pushing boundaries) and he pushed me, I fell from the sofa and hit a piece of furniture, and he never apologised. He also says if I got hurt when I was a child it’s on me because my perception was incorrect, so it’s not his fault and has nothing to apologise for. My relationship with my brother is also not good. After trying to be kind despite of his threats and painful words, I’m now blocked and I think I won’t go the extra mile this time. It makes me very sad seeing my family so broken and in so much pain.

Looking at my relationship history, clearly there’s a lot of things going on with me. A lot of things out of balance, to say the least.

I’m not sure that I can healthily attach to someone and I also don’t know if I want to.

I am at a loss with my inner world, I don’t know what all this means. I can’t believe I was with a married man for 5 years, it feels as if that girl wasn’t me. 

I’m only comfortable in the intellectual realm, where I thrive and feel connected to ideas and reasonings. I like reading books and listening to music, problem solving and spending time in nature and animals. I also like playing sports so at least I’m around people some times.

On the other hand, I have some doubts with regards to my sexuality.

Sometimes I fantasize about having a man in my life who provides me a sense of safety and comfort, and fucks me hard too.

But then, I rarely like a guy and if I do it’s mostly about looking at them from a distance and fantasising about their body. I often feel attracted to gay, feminine men or trans women. I don’t feel like kissing them and I surely don’t want to be alone with them in a room but I like the idea of it. I feel like I’m off sexually in general. Penetration is very painful for me to the extent that I don’t think I had penetration with the married man more than 5-10 times in 5 years. For me it was mostly about the huge, caressing and oral sex for him. He would also make me cum and be very soft to me.

Most men feel like a threat, the way they look at me and prepare me with words to have sex makes me feel like a piece of meat. And when I meet a guy that it’s good and feels safe, I’m just not attracted to them or find them too boring, too soft. I would only have sex with a guy who behaves like a predator and kind of forces me or rather leads me to have sex with him. Although I’m pretty sure I would ask him to stop and if he doesn’t (it’s never happened to me) maybe I’d be happy to get raped to see if at last I can have penetration and enjoy it. I don’t know, in my head that’s sexy. In practise it’s not I suppose.

I am very sexually attracted and ready for a beautiful girl though. It’s looking at her eyes, hair, mouth and boobs and I just get wet. But somehow I also don’t like the idea of getting too sexual, I just feel like kissing her and caressing her, feeling her, sensually, in a sweet and passionate way. When they want more or go down on me I just stay laying there feeling strange and weird inside, a bit paralysed even if I like her and have a lot of desire for her I just don’t know what to do. I also feel a bit uncomfortable with my own body, because even though people consider me very beautiful my boobs are small.

I also found out last year that my dad was raped when he was 10, and since my brother used to tell me that he was scared my dad would rape me, I connected the dots and contacted my brother to clarify. He then told me that he saw my (same mom, different dad) dad rubbing my vagina displaying signs of pleasure when my mother was out and he thought nobody was watching. I’m not sure if something else happened and I don’t know if it’s relevant. He is the cold intellectual type so when I was little I would grab the phone, hide and call my mother so she would come and pick me up after they divorced. I started buying my nails after spending a weekend with him where he clarified I was less educated than my cousins. And probably, he was right. I think I’m just very unfit to live.

Really, I just would like to die. I’m pretty much just going through each day feeling relieved that one more day is one less day.

I don’t think my problems have a solution. I don’t think I can let myself do what needs doing to maybe stand a chance to get better.

Yes, I’ve been doing some therapy and after a pause I will go back to it.

I don’t know why I came here but any advice will be very welcomed. Thank you."	Loose-Tea-7478	post	21.942410579603134	female	White	0.9982722997665405	na	na	na	7	depression_help

"Well, you clearly have some issues, not judging, I have a shitload. It sounds like you repressed a lot of things and it also sounds like youre honestly trying to work through your problems. I cant paint it all pink. From my experience, and probably yours too, its a process. You make the same mistake over and over until you manage to avoid it, then something else comea up, but thats the way you grow and heal. 

Im also very focused on romantic relationships, but i think that its to my detriment, especially when im so depressed like now. For me, coming out of that place, looking for love, makes me feel even more detached and isolated, because i feel so depressing, creepy and unlike all the happy healthy people. 

So my advice, that I also try to implement, and obviously aside from therapy (which is very helpful, but is a long process) would be to try and put less focus on your romantic relationships, and try to focus on self care, you need to learn how to hold on and find what little good you can by yourself, and then youll have a more solid foundation of self to rely on, and also youll have happiness to share. 

I took up drawing recently, you like sports, which is an awesome and very social hobby. Its a cliche but really, even in a very dark place, its focusing on the tiny bits of good you can give yourself. Even if somedays that just means to get out of bed instead of lying in it and succumbing to the infinite dark.

"Understandable. You are not alone. I tell you my situation. May this help you. It's bit long. ( Sorry)

I ( 23 F ) have never been in a relationship and I am also a virgin. I love men and I am sure about it. I currently have a crush on a guy and each moment near him is special for me. We are both shy and have a bit of social anxiety. We were watching each other for many months but I never took it seriously, I was just attracted and nothing more because I was in love with my friend ( 23 M ) but then I found out my friend likes someone else and I was tired of feeling inferior than that woman with whom he is. It took a year to be able to move on from him. Now this guy whom I like currently, I love to imagine cuddles and everything. We were just watching each other for many days and then last week I was going for a tea break ( we are in the same office), I smiled and invited him to follow me to the stairs. We were both alone there until another man came there while talking to someone on the phone. He took a few minutes but he came and I really loved it because he came. Well but then we both felt anxious again. He was watching on his phone and drinking tea and I was just doing the same while searching on WikiHow, how to talk to the guy for the first time being socially anxious. I kept on searching, drinking tea and then looking at him but then as my tea break was over, I was going to my department again and I felt regretful because we couldn't even talk. I was still happy because of those moments with him even in anxiety, it was dreamy and as I was putting my phone back on the locker he came after me and looked at me with regrets ( I feel he was saying like why I left so early or maybe why I didn't initiate a talk with him knowing perfectly that he is introvert like me too. But then when I was going home, I saw him coming on a bike behind me and he flirted with me through eyes saying to be continued on next week. Tomorrow is Monday and I am sure we are going to try to connect with each other again. I will go there again and I would love it if he kissed me on the first day itself, I can imagine myself sleeping and doing everything with him. 

Now there is a problem too. I am bi curious. I don't like to be with a women because it makes me feel less feminine and I don't like to please them. My mother was and is toxic. I love and crave for motherhood in other women. But I have it when a woman sees me in a sexual way. It makes me feel uncomfortable. There is a woman in my team who is homosexual and her place is near my table. I feel really uncomfortable because of her behaviour. I never go to the washroom when she is going there because she is creepy. I, completely agree that I love to see women, their Beauty, their motherhood and watching them makes me feel healing, fulfilled, nourished and motherhood. Whenever I watch sessions of one of the spiritual masters ( female) for my questions, their words and knowledge heal me for sure but also I love their angelic 🪽 appearance. I am afraid of this woman in my office. She follows me. She keeps on staring at me. She takes any of my work related friendly talk as a hint of saying yes to him. This pressurises me and increases my homophobia. She is lesbian so she is not able to respect a bisexual woman and her thought process. She thinks I am only homosexual and I am not able to accept myself and she keeps on staring at me and making me feel uncomfortable. When I behave rudely with her to stop her she behaves as if I am a bad person or shows how disappointed she is. She is just not getting it that I am not interested in her or maybe she understands but doesn't want to respect my choice. For some reason, I am not able to change the place in my workplace. See, I am in full pressure and fears from every side. I don't have any sexual experience. I just know that I don't want to take any decision which makes me regrets later on. I can't be with two people. I believe in my dream love marriage and I believe in loyalty. Even if I am bisexual, I would never cheat on my man for any women and I know I am able to have a fulfilling life with a male because trust me from my childhood I have fantasized about being with a man and doing everything and sleeping while hugging him naked but these homosexual woman in my social life gives me burden and pressurises me. I learnt this today that I am not alone and you are also not alone. In fact you are much stronger and experienced than me. My advice is to never pressure yourself for being with anyone especially if you think you are being manipulated. Well I would love to have heavy rough sex life life in shades of grey with my this to be boyfriend and I want you to understand the difference between honestly liking to be roughly intimate with someone and feeling manipulated and dominated and used by someone for their benefit in which you may or may not't have much interest from the your side. Currently, I will do whatever way I will feel comfortable. I will follow my guy crush when I feel like. I will go with him and when I like it. I will never going to follow that woman no matter what gestures she shows. I deserve to have my choice and nobody has a right to pressurise and manipulate me in my love life. I hope the best for you whichever way it is. Just see that you are not alone and you are worthy of love. I would love advice from you too on how do I easily make her understand that I don't want her and I want to feel comfortable while working. I have even told her that I am interested in guys ( I can't give her any hope by saying that I am bisexual or bi curious) but she is so dominating and creepy. It's a headache now."

First of all, I am a man, 26 years, I am a little depressed right now, because of one thing very personal. But seeing your story helped me a little bit, it was so sad sometimes and others very fun, you seems like a very good person.

Just the way you have described I feet love in it, and is very sincere. If I will give one little advice when you have another depression, I would talk to you that there are somethings for example true love are more enjoyable than everything, this thing helps keeps me awake when i depressed.

Yeah, maybe your problems have a very difficult solution, or not at all, maybe it will happen in the perfect time, who knows?

On your request, I would address her quite firmly. I would tell her that I am not interested in her and that her behaviour is denounceable as harassment and if she doesn’t stop you will be forced to report it.

When you have depression or other mental health conditions and people are trying to get you to attend places such as groups to meet others.  Have a think 🤔 before you turn if this going to be suitable for you. 

Is it going to going to be worth the travelling distance if you’ve got travel by bus or train or in the car just turn up for an hour?

How tired you are feeling in terms of physically and mentally, if you are working too and/or studying factor this in. You don’t wanna show up feeling like you need fifteen cups of coffee.

Think about the cost, in terms of getting there and back, if you gotta attend a group for an hour is the £3.50 to park a car and petrol worth that hour or the £9.00+ and 30-40 mins wait for train. 

Can the group be accessible on teams or zoom if you cannot attend because of your depression/anxiety or you don’t feel like turning up in person?

Will you gain something from attending, a qualification or will it be waste of time and energy? 

Can my time be used for other things I prefer to do in the comforts of my own home? Remember when you have depression your home is the most comfortable place to be, where you feel safest. 

Think about convenience too. Turning up to a group or activity can be very stressful when you are already anxious, stressed and depressed? So have a think if playing a computer game, reading a book, joining a chat room or discord community and having fun playing YouTube or listening to music is more worth your time and positive and productive for your wellbeing. 

It’s very easy to turn on my PlayStation 4 and get playing fallout 4, then show up to some naff support group the nhs or mind runs.

I feel that I can do more with my time on the game or do other activities (penpals) then spend an hour and half plus travelling there and back listening to some ass talk about the poxy weather or moan their problems.  While I’m sitting there trying not to nap because of the boredom while staring at my phone.

If you do attend, bring things to do, some music, a book or magazine as sitting listening to someone moan for 1.5 can get extremely boring and depressing."	BlueEyedGirl86	post	21.69029074409505	male	White	0.999487042427063	na	na	na	1	depression_help

"Hi all, 

My name is Lana Bojanić and I am a research assistant and PhD candidate at the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Safety in Mental Health (NCISH) at the University of Manchester. 

As a part of my doctoral research under the supervision of Dr Isabelle Hunt, I am conducting a study on **people with suicidal thoughts/behaviours who use the internet in the UK**. Insights from this study aim to be used to inform and improve patient safety and care. 

This study aims to recruit people in contact with mental health services to share their experiences with suicidality and the internet and provide insight into how the two interact and create potential risks and benefits. 

I believe that the experiences of people in contact with mental health services are necessary to obtain an accurate picture of the clinical and internet environment they are in. 

Please consider sharing your experiences in this survey if you are eligible using this link [https://www.qualtrics.manchester.ac.uk/jfe/form/SV\_86yZjYSqTMzS086](https://www.qualtrics.manchester.ac.uk/jfe/form/SV_86yZjYSqTMzS086). Also, it would be of great help if you would share this link with your network.

Participation is entirely voluntary and anonymous and takes approximately 15 minutes. 

Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Thank you so much for your help! 

Lana Bojanić

"I came to know recently that my friend is battling depression after he opened up. 
My friend is a jovial and tries to maintain a happy relationship with everyone who he meets on a daily basis. He doesn't have a large circle of friends.
He never shared his personal life stories with me, but I came to know that he was mentally down and when I asked him about it he told me that he lived with his parents and they were having a troubled relationship. He quit his job because he was mentally tired of this but his parents always complained that he quit his job to have affairs with the neighbours ( since he has a good relationship with them). 
He has also tried many counseling sessions with psychologists but they were all vain.
I have never seen him like this, help me help him."	Willdoggou	post	33.09204377143138	female	White	0.01451058778911829	na	na	na	1	depression_help
Your friend is suffering from a sickness. Despresion is a sickness and only a doctor/therapist can cure him from his depression. You can be there to support him, you can listen to him but sadly you cant make his suicidal thoughts go away. Be there for him. But you need to tell him that he need professional help.

I have no purpose in my life and I don’t really care to find one. I don’t want to do anything. The only things that sound remotely interesting to me are unobtainable without at least a decade of hardwork and I simply do not care enough to put that work in. If I were given those things today I wouldn’t even want them because I would feel like a fraud/loser. I genuinely do not see a way out of this mindset and it’s gotten to the point that I think the most economical move would be to just end it. I don’t want people’s time, effort and support to be wasted on me. I hate every aspect of my being and instead of dragging out a mediocre existence it just seems best to call it quits. I don’t want any sympathy or for people to feel bad for me I just don’t want to be here anymore. Not a single reason to wake up in the morning. I literally care about nothing. Every day is a task and I feel like I’m just wandering pointlessly. Every ounce of self belief is gone and I see not metaphorical light at the end of the tunnel. I guess I’m just writing this to get it off my chest so I can at least say I didn’t hold it all in. Thank you for taking the time to read and I just feel so sorry to humanity for existing.	anonaccount2121	post	19.93274573138175	male	White	0.9991588592529297	na	na	na	7	depression_help

Hi there.  I feel the way you do at times.  I feel so tired of everything.  But i look at my kids and i don't want them to turn out like me.  I have to fight for them.  Do you have someone you love?  If not,  i know we don't know each other but i would like you to fight. You deserve to be here like the rest of us. You deserve something good and worth fighting for.  There must be something you love?  If people have hurt you,  i totally understand you there.  My heart had been hurt from everyone.  I learned to forgive to heal myself.  My friend, my heart is with you because i understand all your pain and almost took my life for it.  I had a failed suicide and it made me feel more hurt for my parents because i disappointed them.  It was very hard to gain their trust again.  I was sent to the psychiatrist and the psychologist. My friend, maybe you can list all that you care about whether it's little or great.  See what your list says? If you have to do the list that hurt,  then do that too. Maybe you can find out the cause of everything?  I did that to get my prioritirs of life. I'm not sure if anything helped but i will keep you in prayer and in my heart.  I send you  hugs, hope, joy and answers you seek. Fight my friend, okay?

"I just made a Reddit account today and im not really sure about how it works, so im sorry if i make a mistake. And english also isnt my first language!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Basically I really need some help, im so lonely these days and I feel so depressed and disgusted with myself. I dont even know how  to explain this.

So im actually very young, Im 11 years old and turn 12 in october, I live in the Netherlands.

I dont know how to really say this but, i keep getting more bad trauma flashbacks of when i was younger and feel more disgusted with myself with how my family and kids at school would treat me/still treat me. My anger issues have gotten worse and i cry myself to sleep everynight, ive gotten more distant with everyone i know in real life. I used to get a lot of panic attacks every night but i dont anymore these days. But one day my family found out about me getting a panic attack because they got mad at me and told my sister to go thru what i was doing on my phone, luckily she didnt see much because the first app she clicked on was YouTube. She went in my history and saw like 6 videos that i watched about how to stop a panic attack, because i would get them alot those days and i got sick of them that i even watched videos. My whole family basically got scared and my mom & sister cried when my dad got mad at me, they kept begging me to tell them what was going on with me and if theres anything wrong, i just lauged even tho i was really nervous and i just said that theres nothing wrong with me and i didnt know how i had gotten it.

There was this one time i had gotten a panic attack at day because i was going thru an episode, i went to the toilet and well.. you know? I cried and basically got really frustrated and at the end my eyes were really red. I even saw & heard stuff that werent there, when i looked at myself in the toilet mirror i saw a face of a demon/devil or something morphed in my own, i kept hearing voices saying ''god hates you''. And i panicked even more because i grew up really religious and had gotten distant from God.

And once when i had another panic attack or whatever it was, i saw stuff again. I saw like this black figure and i thought it was someone real, it felt really real tho. I hugged the black figure and whispered words to it. After when it had dissapeared i kept seeing crosses when i closed my eyes and in the dark, because the lights of the toilet were off. I kept seeing crosses, graves & churches. My family is muslim but i really want to be christian and have sort of reverted to christianity.

Basically why i dont wanna be muslim is, i have a tanned skin color, a sort orange tan? And this happend in 4th grade, so i was was 8 because of dutch schools. I was just sitting in class until my friends came up to me, well i dont know if we really were friends. There were like 3 of them and they all 3 were muslim, with you know, pale skin. 2 turkish girls and 1 from Syria, they came up to me and kept laughing at me and kept asking me stuff like: ""Huh? How do you have brown skin? How are you even muslim? Arent muslims always white?'' And i remember telling them: ""Can you stop? I will tell the teacher about you guys."" Then they panicked and said: ''No dont tell the teacher! Ok im sorry.'' My memory is quite vague but it happend like that. But i really regret not telling the teacher, they panicked becase they were known for being good and polite students, yk? But its not like i never was insecure about my skin color, i would be prettier if i had really pale skin. My parents would even call me racist stuff growing up, like they would call me the color black with offensive words aswell.

And basically now, ive become more mature and act depressive with my parents, they keep getting mad at everything i do. They get mad at me because i dont eat enough or dont talk to them and that im too much on my phone. There were these times where i almost stabbed my sister. She always tests my anger issues and acts annoying on purpose. That once i almost stabbed her and my mom saw itt and got really mad at me, she even said she only acts ""'nice'' with me because she doesnt want me to hate her, like i hate everyone else i know irl.

But my dad also is really disgusted of me, i always hear him talking bad about me to my sister & mom and thinks i dont hear him. He calls me filthy, rotten, unclean and disgusting but he praises my sister. He even said that hes embarrassed to even go out with me in public because i look homeless, which i dont. Just because i hate my body and have body dysphoria and wear baggy clothes to hide myself from others. Im even scared to sit in the room with my parents because they find me disgusting.

They also keep thinking i have a illness, they wanna get me a counselor. My sister even thinks i have ASD or ADHD. Which i do think i have one of them myself because of the  symptoms and signs, i did alot of research. But hey, im not diagnosing myself.

More disgusting stuff that i really hate happend to me but im not saying that, i doubt people will read this and care, but i just wanted to vent.

But what i wanted to say is, i really dont wanna live with my family, i wanna live alone, i catch myself praying that my family will die and that i wont tell anyone. I just wanna move to a other country, even tho im young. I dont have any family members or friends i could stay at. I wanna move to a other country, i already have my future planned out. I really wanna move out alone for a long time, i dont know where to get money or how to go to the airport, and i dont even have outside wifi. I know what job i want, what to study, how i want my life to be. In 1 week im going back to school and its my last year then, 8th grade is the last and after i go to high school. Netherlands has levels of how smart you are and i right now i have HAVO, which is the second smartest, I just have to become good in the language in the country i wanna move to and become a therapist.

&#x200B;

I feel embarrassed and cringe at myself for writing such a long paragraph about myself. But i just wanted some advice and thought reddit would be able to help. Sorry."	allandzh	post	13.432635760171161	female	White	0.9962118864059448	na	na	na	1	depression_help
"It's okay to struggle. It's okay to get help 

So a few things.

Firstly. Never be ashamed of the color of your skin.

God made you that way, and you are made in His image.

Anyone who has trouble accepting this, you should question their faith.

God does not condone racism, but died for all.

Secondly, you wish to be a Christian. Good.

Jesus gave us the Gospel, the one true revelation of God 

We disobeyed God, behaving wickedly, every day going astray, becoming worthless in word thought and deed.

For this we deserve hell.

But Christ came at the right time to live a perfect life, die the perfect death, and buy us back from the enemy.

So when we believe Him and in His resurrection, and dedicate ourselves to following Him, we are saved from death, and become a new creation.

We are new, and live our lives for Him.

And in the end when life is done, we will be restored to Him completely.

I'm sorry you suffer from panic attacks. They suck.

Remember you are in control, even in those moments.

It takes some work, but you can calm down.

I hope you get better, find peace, and walk with Christ"	allandzh	reply	na	na	na	0.9962118864059448	weak	no	no	na	depression_help
"This is probably going to be a bit long, I'm not sure yet (Also, obligatory on mobile disclaimer)

So, I've been struggling with depression for the past 8 months, and for the most part I was able to live with it (albeit not well). Around two months ago I started taking medication to help with said depression, and it really did work. 

Around two days ago, I'm not sure what happened, but my depression seemed to come back, and come back harder than it had felt before. Today, I was barely even able to get the energy to leave my bed a couple of times.

Now, I've struggled with suicidal ideations in the past, but for some reason they had become 10 times worse over the past 48 hours. This all culminated with me sitting and crying on my bed with a note and a knife in my hands. The only thing that stopped me going through with hurting myself was the thought of how much I'd let everyone I know and care about down, how disappointed they'd be, how much time, effort, and money I would waste, and how it much it would affect my hard working mom (who has also had struggles with depression over her lifetime). I just couldn't bring myself to do it. 

I need help, I need to talk to someone I care about. I don't know if I want to talk to my parents however since, from prior experience, I could see them turning everything into a lecture, and blowing everything out of proportion. I really want to talk to my girlfriend (also 17) about this whole ordeal, but I'm worried it would just be too much of a burden to put on her, and on top of that, she's having a sleepover with some friends, and I really don't want to ruin her good time

I just don't know what to do anymore, I just feel so empty, so tired, but I don't want to bring this up with adults, because I don't want it to become a bigger issue than it really is. Idk"	mcfluffernutter013	post	21.772296386480043	male	White	0.995468020439148	na	na	na	6	depression_help

"To start, I (19f) go to a Canadian university. My entire plan, for as long as I could remember, was to work my way up to a PhD in psychology.

I am about to enter my third year (a year ahead of schedule due to highschool as well as spring and summer courses). I just found out that the Masters program at my school only accepts Honours degree students, and although my grades are good enough, my psych average is not high enough to even be considered for acceptance into the Honours program.

With that settled, I signed up for the LSAT, hoping to get into the law program after I get my bachelor's.

But honestly, I have not idea what I'm going to do if I don't get in. I can't afford to keep taking the LSAT (~$300 for a test) and applying (~$150 to apply). 

I've been depressed for so long that I've always had the back up plan of offing myself if I started failing in school, because I can't afford to waste tens of thousands of dollars, and in this economy and society, it's almost impossible to do anything without a degree.

My problem is that last summer, when I was in a better place mentally, I adopted a cat, who is the best thing in my life. Now I know I can't abandon him.

So, knowing that I can't purposefully die, I'm stuck with the probability that I will continue to disappoint my family, and the idea that I won't be able to get a good enough job to help my mom out of a financially, mentally, and emotionally abusive relationship.

I just don't know what to do. I'm not good enough for anything. No matter how hard I study, or how hard I try, I'm not good enough.

I just need advice for surviving until one day my cat passes away and I can go to.

I'm sorry if this all seems stupid."	Spencersfish	post	24.812876840729015	female	White	0.9948492646217346	na	na	na	3	depression_help

"Hey, I'm on the other side of the globe from where you are, and I don't really understand the rules and regulations for your university acceptance. But I've been in a similar situation when i was 16. I needed to get a degree so that i could help my mom financially and get her out of a bad relationship. I failed in every test I took to get into a university and i felt like i had nothing to offer to this world. I was following everyone's advice till that point of my life and realised that i was facing consequences for someone else's decisions(advice). I took a year and put my efforts into my preparation for the tests i had to take to get into uni. I got an admission in a decent university in my second attempt and now i have a decent job and i live with my mom and i would say she's happy(at least without any issues to deal with).

Firstly, stop putting pressure on yourself for not achieving whatever it is and start to appreciate the fact you're willing to put so much effort to make your mom's life better. The world isn't fair, all you could do is fight and you're doing that everyday. Pleaseeee.. Love yourself.

Second thing i would say is to explore all possible ways to get into the program/degree that you wanted and put your efforts into those. I'm pretty sure you can crack it.

Finally, Whatever the result is... It's not you. There's only so much we can do from the situation we're in. And as long as you do your best, that's enough.

The death is better than this friendship .. sometimes I think It had be better if we never met or we never say on same bench.. her actions hurts me so deep .. I am having a fight with my bestfriend, last year we total had 4 fight and those fight last for months or weeks and in this new year I had assured myself that I will not fight with her anymore..and these 7 months I have kept my promise well but in this month I don't know how the fight started like I have didn't done anything.. but still -- 
Sha( my bestfriend) is nice good, but she is jealous type of person she gets jealous often. Recently I have been hanging out with my another friend Hana.. and now she is jealous and she things that's Hana has more importance in my life than her lol can someone explain her  tell her that no you are my importance ... And now it's been a week and she is ignoring me .. she's acting like I am ghost when I am around her..  I know my fault okey I will stop hanging with her but tell me we are not in same grades, we just spend one period with each other that is C.S class.(.so what she things that rest of school time I should ghost myself and not talk to anyone...) She used to reserve seat for me in that period but these day she is not reserving it and she gave my seat to one of the arrogant girl.. and this is what hurts me the most that now I am that low (not deserving) and how can she replace me to the arrogant girl .....and If she hangs out with many of her different friend- I am just allowed to watch not say anything.. I have no right to jealous. But if I am hanging out with any of my friends she has full right to get jealous... 
I am not able to reach out to her these week in school so I contracted her.. (I know I have to contract her very soon but-) but she is acting too cold and that's hurting me soo much.. like while writing these things the tears are dropping out of my eyes.. I asked her to tell what the problem but she didn't reply me anything at first and after a long time she replied me in a arrogant way -
Explain how she didn't like when I am with Hana and she told me in order to if I want to her back I have to stop hanging out with her( I was completely okey with that) and in order if I want her to once again to reserve my seat in C.S. class it is compulsory for me to gave my lunch in the break and that's not a problem but the problem is that she have her lunch with a group and I don't feel good in sitting with them... I don't get a nice vibe and I have tell her about this many times but she didn't never try understand it .....

"Honestly I have since 2018 and slowly have been coming out of my ""isolation phase"" in my life and one thing for certain is that being isolated for a certain amount of time is unhealthy. While at the same time, made me realize how toxic others actually are and see others for who and what they really are. 

Being isolated for a while could educate us and finally get the ball  rolling in certain areas in our life. 

But honestly, I believe after a period of isolation, I believe it is liberating because depending on how we take it, we could grow during that period of our lives and see things differently, if we were always around people without having that ""break away."""

I took the pandemic as an isolation point while doing therapy and it changed my life. BUT here’s the huge thing, when depressed, isolating is devastating. We as humans are designed to be social, when we’re not we get even more depressed.

I've been going through it a lot recently, and this weekend in this past week has been horrible I would say the past 3 months I've been the most isolated I've been as a human in my whole entire existence. It's all going to change next week, I just made a big post about my situation. I hate it I'm sick of being isolated. I'm sick of being hungry and not wanting to go see people on the street... So I don't eat because I just don't want to see people. I'm going to make it through this, but this has to change. Before the pandemic life wasn't like this, as soon as I can get out of this situation I'm in I think things will be better but right now this is horrible. Isolation. It scares me a little bit too, after getting drugged and robbed I'm so isolated here that I could die and no one notice. That has to change. People would notice but nobody around me in this this city would notice until electric bill didn't get paid, and maybe someone would knock on my door. So odd here, people are so odd it's impossible to meet a single friend and I'm generally an outgoing person. This all going to change I just need the situation to pass, but these hours hard to pass right now. At least it's only a couple more hours until I can consider going to bed again. Tomorrow at least there's light if immigration has my card. They told me to come back on Monday, that got stolen from me , so I can't go anywhere until I get that and then I can go. But this isolation is horrible right now.. something I don't trust everybody but I don't really trust anyone right now, here in the city I know everyone's all bad and the experience been so horrible I just don't even want to go to the store right now to get food	DivineMistress35	reply	na	na	na	0.997138500213623	weak	strong	no	na	depression_help

I am a (non black/indigenous) POC person that came on to Reddit mainly due to discuss about situations and issues at the time regarding my race but overall quite comfortable about myself as a person overall. Unfortunately I would happen to come across a few subreddits that initially seemed like they were pushing upon some controversial topics regarding certain issues that weren’t shown on mainstream media, but eventually led towards me getting pulled into a rabbit hole into what I would describe as an incel breeding ground that preys on insecurities and frustrations of them and uses that to create problematic views and assumptions on life which then get spread to more viewers who might also fall into this trap (you probably have some ideas of which subreddits I’m talking about). Whatever the case, I believe that it has created some screwed up thoughts and ruined my perspective on dating, interracial marriage and other aspects regarding race that I was previously okay with before, but now have since made me insecure, judgmental and would most likely put me in racist incel territory. I’m just wondering how I can possibly get myself to stop having these thoughts and maybe even get back to being the confident person that I once was.

This sub is a good one. r/socialskills is a good one. 

I'm white and grew up surrounded by almost entirely open racist adults (and kids.) Once you've been conditioned by all that junk it can be easier for exposure to it to flip a switch in your brain. Like a super racist Jason Bourne. But the more you keep filling your head with actual facts and helpful psychology related information, the less powerful all the racist and woman hating stuff gets. Eventually you can't believe in it anymore just the same as you could never believe in the tooth fairy again. It just takes facts and remembering that the incel community HAS to make you hate yourself for that crap to keep working.

Just take a deep breath whenever you come across something that seems off and try to think of all the alternative points of view.  Then lean towards the point of view that has the least amount of negativity attached to it.

We are meant to Love all, so if something seems to spread hate ask yourself why. No matter the community there's always members that want to push hatred. Hate of other races or genders or sexual orientation or nationality etc... But why?

A wise man once said something along the lines of, 'We must all hang together or surely we will all hang separately'

"I'm glad you recognize this. It's a step above what you're talking about. From what I've seen, incels are self defeating because they forfeit their power to change, grow, and be healthy.

I kind of have had a similar experience with being a sealion.
Sealion ask polite, probing questions to frustrate. It's abuse and interrogation, with a heavy control dynamic. The person never actually makes conversation, just asks questions and ensures they are even.

Unfortunately I learned this from someone close to me, and had subconsciously started doing it.

I learned about the term through a meme.

So I had the choice to change and I did.

Because you literally cannot make a sealion change. They will only continue to torture you.

Incels are likely the same way in some respects. It's learned helplessness that destroys their relationships and chances to be good men.

They can't change because it's self reinforcing. So they refuse to.

So I don't really know where to turn to, so I found myself here. So I have a side job pouring beer and of course that comes with a lot of interactions with a lot of different people. I know that putting on a happy face will make me more tips. I had a customer comment on how cheerful I was and I know she meant that in a good way, but it felt almost like an insult. I wish I was actually as happy as I am able to pretend to be. But thing this customer and others who might ever have thought is that I sleep way less than I should, especially in the last week where I have laid wake mentally writing my goodbye letter and trying to come up the best exit strategy. I feel guilty for lying to these people just so give me more money. I feel guilty for not actually just being happy. I don't have any friends or family I can turn to, I feel absolutely stuck in my current situation and I'm just so tired of working 50 to 60 hours a week and constantly having to put on this face that I know isn't mine. I can't make it till I make, I've been doing that for years and I'm no closer to happy than when I first trying to find it. I think the black dog has found it's forever home.

"I made the questionable move of breaking into pandora's vault to find out what I'm truely feeling. Ever since I was 7, when we moved from my favorite school and friends, nothing was the same. I became numb. I, for some reason, took a cage, locked my emotions away, and never knew it. I thought I just didnt have anything wrong going on. It wasnt until I started questioning myself. Why didnt I find ____ depressing? Why didnt I mourn at funerals that meant most? Why did I only open up to 1 person about sibling troubles (about one of my younger brothers)? Why was he able to make me break down in emotion but nothing else was? Was it the fact that I had someone, who I trusted, tell things about? Why did I dig further? Why did I have to look further into myself...

After lots of years of being moved, we moved again, we've been moved again for 1 year. I have stopped doing what I love to do. I have stopped reading, I have recently slowed down crafting, I recently have realized my bond with my dog was no more.. I stopped taking responsibility for her (my family does now). I care for her but.. I cant make myself do anything for her except feed her and give her water.. (my family have taken over now). I have been the ""2nd mom"" as my mom calls it. I try to get my brothers to obey the rules but one is very... genetically messed up so he's more moody and VERY hard to deal with and I get in trouble for it. Maybe my method (such as telling them to do what their supposed to) doesnt help..  but what am I supposed to do? Tattle? Parents get annoyed. Even when kid-sitting he doesnt listen. My oldest brother is like my friend but when he doesnt take meds he is the opposite and very verbally damaging (no cussing, we all have at least some self control). Other than me trying to tell my little brothers to obey the rules, I help my mom out a lot she says... and I believe I have. But it's come at a price against myself.

I am getting slower at taking care of myself. I am starting to lose track of events that are on the calendar. I have slowed down on the process of making youtube videos (animal vids). Today I sat on my bed and literally ate 4 different foods. 1 protein at 5am. Oatmeal. Gluten-free nilla wafers (family has allergies that effect moods, I have more control than the littles though). I have stopped finding joy in researching my pets. I have, for 4 days now, stopped looking for a job.. I used to look every day. My cat helps out... she isnt always a snuggle bug, although tolerant to being ""forced"" to snuggle (not really force, she's okay with it, but she helps a lot. I have a friend group (that I share with my oldest brother). One guy is real nice, he's an introvert that turned extrovert so he understands (me, and introvert) when I need to be included... this has helped me open up to the group.. at a very fast pace.. at least to him and his sister. I think about him almost constantly. I want someone to know about my depression, I'm close with his sister enough where she offers to listen... but I've been in denial about being depressed. I'm trying to come up with a subtle way to get her and her brother to see I'm depressed, without outright telling them. (I make self-awareness vidoes on youtube so I'm trying to figure out a way to not say my problems outright (bc its public) but also tell them I'm depressed through it. I break down in sadness thinking of what he'd ract like... would he be oblivious or want me to sit down and talk about it, actually caring like he seems he would? How would I talk about it with him...? He and his sister are the only thing keeping me in the friend group, the group isnt small and they often spread out into their ""close"" friends group circles. They're the reaso I still hang out with friends.. my other, older friends I dont even talk to or text... I hope they dont feel I've forgotten them. Today, I spent 30+ minutes convincing myself to shower. Then I spent another 30+ minutes hugging my knees with sad lofi music in the background, water pouring on my head and back... hiding my tears from myself. I ended up crying for about 10+ more minutes.. thats longest I've cried since kindergarten-hood.

I feel like I need to read the Bible, grow my bond with God. But... I cant make myself do anything that requires me to read or listen to things (music is off and on). My adhd self is aching to do *SOMETHING* ...but I cant.

I dont went to talk to a therapist about it, I cant put things into talking words very well and frankly I dont want to open up (face-to-face) with a stranger (virtual wont help, it'll be in one ear and out the other).

I would go to my parents but they'd talk about a therapist, my dad wouldn't really understand and other than that, my mom would say sorry and hug me... that doesnt help, she says sorry with a hug  to everything I tell her about how I feel... I guess its because she cant do much about it.

I prayed to God that I'd get a solution, by myself preferably or with whoever He chose. I trust He'll help me, he always has.

What would you do?

I'm like a ship trying not to tip in the middle of a storm I barely feel... yet when I let myself, I feel it in my heart. I've only lately been accepting that I have depression.

I will accept any advice as long as its *not* against God.

At times, the most effective way to offer assistance is by reminding individuals that their identity and ego are shaped by their environment. Past mistakes and wrongdoings can then be viewed as misaligned coping skills or responses to trauma.

"sorry for any bad grammar. trigger warnings for sexual assault, suicidal ideation and self harm.

before i start, i have to say that i have a long history of struggle with mental illness, especially depression. i am a 20 year old woman. so, me and my friend were out on this weeks wednesday. there was this creepy man who talked to us, didn't think much of it at first but later he asked us to go on a drive with him. me and my friend were quite drunk, but i still thought that it was a bad idea, but my friend wanted to go on a drive and i couldn't talk her out of it, and didn't want her to go alone, so i went with her. the man started feeling me up in the car and i felt panicked. i tried telling my friend that we should go, but she didn't listen. the mam drove us to his place, and again i only went in because i couldn't talk my friend out of it. this is where it gets fuzzy. it feels like my brain just wiped out most of the events that went on at his place. i don't know how long we were there, but he forced me to give him bj. i was in absolute panic, and i am shaking as i am typing this. after that, he went to get something from his car and finally, i convinced my friend that we should leave. she told me that she was scared and couldn't say no, so thats why she stayed. after we left, i was in panic. i couldn't stop shaking or crying. two of our friends walked us to my place and both of them immediately realized that something happened. i couldn't stop thinking of how i wanted control. i wanted to mutilate myself to a point of getting hospitalized. when we were at my place, my friend went to the bathroom. i relapsed to cutting, after almost being clean for a year and i took a lot of pills. my friend called an ambulance, and at some point we must have told the hospital staff what happened. the staff did a few tests on me, and told me that i should file a police report, but i didn't want to. i just want to forget. then, my mother picked me up and she took me to the police station to file the report. i really didn't want to, but my family told me that i should. now i feel horrible. deeo down, i know that if any of that stuff was consensual, i wouldn't feel like this. it all feels like too much, i don't want to go to court, i don't want any of this. this is a constant reminder of what happened to me and i feel so ashamed, it just feels like that nobody cared what i wanted to do about it. i haven't had this much suicidal ideation or self destructive thoughts in a few months. i really don't want this case to go on further, i don't want to ever see or think of that man again. and what if he starts saying that what he did to me was consensual? what if he tells a bunch of lies? i really don't know what to do. at this moment, i don't really wanns be sober, i don't want to do this. it's all too much. i really wanted to deal with this quietly, without the police getting involved. these last few days have been one of the roughet days i have had ever. it is like everything i feel, i feel it even more intensely than normally. i just feel so lost right now."	sleepyh34d_	post	25.39922537261484	male	White	0.9923610091209412	na	na	na	12	depression_help

Hey hon. I went through something very similar to you. I know it’s very scary and after it happened to me I felt dirty/gross/ashamed and like I wanted to just sink into the earth and forget about it. Filing a police report is scary, but it can be a good thing. Don’t let anyone make you feel like you HAVE to press charges though. A case against him could help other women be aware of his predatory nature… but it is your choice. You have autonomy here. I really recommend seeing a therapist if you can. Everything is going to feel overwhelming and scary for a while, but it gets easier with time, even if it doesn’t feel that way right now.	sleepyh34d_	reply	na	na	na	0.9923610091209412	weak	strong	no	na	depression_help
monsters were once victims, they had to be to normalize the evil that was normalized upon them.that behavior is in no way acceptable or justified.  If I seem rude I don't mean too, I've just had similar shit happen as a kid and only recently have the memories been peeking through. It's all jumbled together though. This realization helped me understand why stuff like that happens. Helped me get past my own stuff at.least to an extent. I'm still work8ng on it though. Don't end it.

Not all monsters were victims. Sure at one point along healing far along that journey finding peace with what a terrible person did to you makes sense. But not when still in crisis.

Certainly,although these truths maybe painful they are necessary for understanding why what happens to us happened to us. Empathy isn't forgiveness it's understanding. It's not sympathy it's simply looking at things from a broader context to give yourself closure so you don't even if by accident go down the road of blaming yourself.  His shit was most likely seated in trauma from childhood. Who knows his birth could have had complications.  Anyhow sometimes it's unclear why people do what they do but having a solid framework to start healing is something. Knowing the actions he did were a cycle broken into him. He was trying to bring you down,hurt you. Put you on his cycle because he doesn't even understand who he is. He's allowed the past to break him. Don't allow the same to happen to you. You are not the past. We are only the present moment.  If you drive a car only looking out the rear view you will crash.	sleepyh34d_	reply	na	na	na	0.9923610091209412	no	no	no	na	depression_help

So it all started when i was in kindergarten. I made friends with a girl named ava gowin. She was the best girl to be friends with, we were best friends as well. Now fast forward to 6th grade, when she harshly informed me about the rumour that im 'mean' and 'annoying', but i didnt rlly care back then. Fast forward one year And it started to matter more and more. Ava had a friend who was named emma and she HATED ME. And thats an underestimate. She hated me because i was positive and an optimist. She hated me because whenever i would have a conflict with someone, i would just run away and act like its a brand new day. For me, that was the only way to handle a conflict. Then ava and i started getting closer. We were, in her words, 'BFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFSSSSSS' to the end. I felt happy that i always would have her by my side. Until she started to get creepier. She would summon demons to go after her enemies and monsters and stuff. She self declares herself as 'evil villain'. And before any of you guys comment 'its just a phase shell get through it' NO IT IS NOT. She told me thats what she thought of herself as and enjoys being called that. She also enjoys being fucking rude. Thats when i started pushing away from her. But i had no other friends. I had to stick with her. And then she replaced me with another girl called yamileth. BTW  srry for not including capitals in here i just dont have motivation. ANYWAYS the story goes on with her lying to me saying she'll hang out with me but she never does. She never fucking did. Except for when yamileth was absent. Then it would be like we always used to be with us. Best friends. I miss those days alot. Then she has to go and abandon me for a month. A WHOLE FUCKING MONTH.  Everyone likes her, so ive never talked to anyone about this. Thats what kickstarted my depression. It really kicks in whenever someone abandons me for whatever reason, or whenever i had done something wrong. Then my current bestie became my current bestie, and happy day. Or was it? The only reason she actually became friends with me is to get me off avas hands. Her exact words btw. I just feel like everyone hates me.

"I feel like my only hope is to just love without the expectation of receiving it in return. To just love everyone as best I can and let go of the silly notion that there could ever be someone who's always there for me. No one can complete me and I'll always be alone because I'm separate from everyone else. It's such a crushing realization to understand that you could spend 5, 10, 15 years with someone you call your sweetheart and any given moment fate could change them and they could abandon you.

It hurts a lot sometimes to accept this life and it's pain but I know I have to let it pass through me and let love come and go. As it leaves though, I feel it robbing me of pieces of my soul. My will is tired and accepts that i'll stare into the empty void until every last tear has been shed leaving me empty.

I just wish I didn't have to die alone, ironic as it is, after a lifetime of being alone, leaving it all behind while no one's there to watch is what I fear. I guess in my final moments, the thought of eyes gazing upon me with sympathy makes me feel loved."	Venting_Ghost	post	18.180473100665026	male	White	0.983910322189331	na	na	na	2	depression_help

"Depression came early this year.

I get depression from about October/November till about March/April. I presume it seasonal but it's a terrible time to be depressed as this is when people are supposed to be happy so a lot of my friends & family tend to just leave me be over winter.  

Last year was particularly bad when I lost a close friend in October, this was rite when my depression kicks in. This all accumulated with me self harming a lot, completely losing myself in drink to blackout point several times week. I would wake up cut and slashes on me. Almost lost my job as I need to work with vulnerable people at times (I know I'm not fit to do this but I'm doing my best and trying to work on things).  

This year has been worrying in that I never felt my depression lift the way it usually does. I usually get really active over summer doing everything from camping, rearranging my full flat, holidays but this year nothing. Its August and I'm already depressed. My drinking and self destructive behaviour seems to be setting in early.  

I always worry over winter that one of these mornings I'm not going to wake up because I've done something ridiculous which is a horrible thing to do to my friends and family.  

Does anyone else live like this? Where evey year seems that you go through the same cycle only getting worse each time? I just wish people would understand how black and dark everything becomes during depression and that all the bad and self destructive behaviour isnt who we 2ant to be."

I work from home and I have my desk next to a window with a lot of sunlight, that completely shifted my episodes. 

When you’re in these episodes you have to look for ways to release dopamine and serotonin: sunlight, outdoors, vitamin d, hobbies that make you happy, exercise. Make a list of things that make you happy, do them. As much as you can.

Hi guys, 
I Just feel that I need to tell someone about my doubts. Basically, I am 20, full time employeed in a quite high-earning job (especially considering my age), studying part-time petroleum engineering at the top ranked STEM university in my country, I work out every second day, I keep my diet clean, I never do drugs/smoking/alcohol, I'm 6,6 feet tall and I think that I'm quite mature for my age. The problem is, that I basically don't have ""Access"" to girls my age. At my job I work only with men, and I study also with only men (let's be honest, petroleum engineering isn't so popular amongst women). I've tried tinder, organised group trips to the mountains, science clubs at my university, even approaching women directly at festivals. None of these methods worked. I've never been in a relationship before, and until I was 19 years old (when I finally went to see a doc and got meds) I struggeled with extreme OCD and social anxiety, so I didn't made any female-friends in the secondary school or earlier in my education (I lived in Norway before secondary school, where, originating from Poland, I got bullied for my ethnicity, and it didn't help me making friends, especially considering my struggle with OCD and social anxiety back them). That's basically it, I try to not think too much about it and rather focus on self-development, however back in my head there is allways this crippling fear that I've missed my shot, and that it is too late for me to ever find a partner that would be attractive and compatible to me. I can especially feel it, when I see couples walking down the streets, or riding in a car together. It's an extremely awful feeling, that stays with me, althought I try to mute it by focusing on my career and gym. However this feeling never quite goes totally away. So, what should I try to do? How should I accept my past? 
Thank you for reading my story guys, I Just really needed to share it with someone."	egerenkulman	post	11.949813716478712	male	White	0.015964103862643242	na	na	na	5	depression_help

I think You most certainly didnt miss anything. You’re 20 u have plenty of time and i think you should honestly hold off on dating anyway. Get your mental health in order first 100% there are ppl who dont get married till mid 30s. U shouldnt even be concerned until 30. Really wait until you’re sure ur ready and ur able to support a family, no point in dating someone if yr not in a position to take care of them	egerenkulman	reply	na	na	na	0.015964103862643242	weak	no	no	na	depression_help

That's pretty much depression summed up right there.  Depression will effect sleep, mood, and concentration,  but it can really effect our perception,  especially of ourselves.	Ecstatic_Owl6277	reply	na	na	na	0.9993428587913513	no	no	no	na	depression_help

Woke up today, found out she was smoking again when she told me she’d quit. Got pretty upset about it, called her a junkie and didn’t want to talk to her. Told her she was undermining all our efforts to get to a better place, since I’m an addicted smoker myself who’s trying to quit. Afterwards she didn’t talk to me. At night, she went out to get drinks while I was showering. Knowing how reckless she can be while drunk I went out to search for her. Found her at a nearby bar. Refused to drink, booked a cab home, said I didn’t wanna talk when she’s drunk and unreasonable. I went home in a cab without her after she threw a fit about me not holding her bottles for her. She arrived home awhile later and I was cleaning up the house getting ready to sleep. She started putting leashes on the dogs (they’re her friend’s whom we were dog sitting for) and told me she was going away with them. I grabbed her phone to see who she was calling and it was indeed her friend. She didn’t like that I snatched her phone and started smashing stuff around the house, flipping tables. Glass cups / laptops / tablets etc were damaged. I grabbed her by her shirt and threw her on the couch, tore her shirt in the process, pinning her down. I was so angry. She started screaming and being all hysterical and I pleaded with her to calm down, telling her I loved her and I’d do anything she wants. So she called her friends and left. Now I’m all alone, I’ve no family to call, no friends either. I’ve locked all windows, taped towels all over my apartment windows, my neighbours must have thought I was mad amidst all the screaming from her. I’m lying in the darkness now and I’ve been here before, mentally. I don’t think I can get up this time. I wish I never existed. I’ve suffered depression for over 10 years, I’ve said so much in so many words. Things never change.	Shxhixmsdk	post	28.16337224736494	female	White	0.9991551637649536	na	na	na	2	depression_help

"Disclaimer - Very depressing story...If you have courage then read it...


Hey everyone...
I am at point in my life that is very terrible...
I many times decide  to end my life...
I am 20 year old ...
I am a guy who loves sexual things like masterbation,sex etc...
But things got change in my life...
life is not in my control...
It's all luck ... whether how much effort you put to not happen...but it happens...this is life...
In January 2021 I lost my right testicle due to torsion...I was doing so much physcial activity..
I was thinking that I will loose weight and be in  great shape...but my dream destroyed..
Loosing right testicle is hard for me..but my dick is fine..still feels good sexual health...

But this point I moved on in 1 month...
Later days I felt discomfort in my remaining testicle for whole 2021... May be it's due to permanent stitches they fixed my remaining testicle...

I got stomach ulcer, stomach pain,skin disease,mild depression, family problem in 2021 also...

Let's talk about 2022..
It's the year which destroys me from my soul...

In February I decided that I will go for walk after eating dinner....
This is my biggest mistake at that time..
I got varicocele grade 2 in my remaining testicle...
My testestrone was 180 due to this...
( I am against varicocele surgery due to risk of losing remaining testicle)
I was in extreme depression...
My bp was 170 at that time...
My mind completely shut up...

But with time taking ayuvedic medicine my hormones improve...
Like in 4 months my testestrone was 286...
Because I made a daily routine to eat almonds, walnut..

Later in July 2022 I got chronic insomnia...
My bp constantly was 150-160...

I know I have been in days where I can't able to sleep for 4-5 days...
It makes your mind completely off...
But I  a courage to overcome this...
Later on Feb month of 2023
Things got better ..
My testestrone was 450 ...it's improving alot...
I think all problems are gone because my bp also calms down Like 130..
But this is not the end ...
I felt so much discomfort in my remaining testicle..
Sometimes I felt depressed due to this...
So 20 days ago I went to urologist..
He diagnose me with prostatatis...
Without any test he prescribed me levofloxacin which is fluoroquinolones...
After taking for 10 days.. I completely lost my erection at all...
I was  doing masterbation in  10 days..(daily one time)

This time I went to depression again...
My bp becomes 160-170...
I felt like I gonna have heart attack...
Fluoroquinolones medicine is responsible for nerve damage in my penis...
Some people got kidney or heart problems from this poison...
So I made a appointment to cardiologist...
He runs all the test echo ,
 ,renal Doppler..
Finds out that everything is okkkkk..
This made a huge relief...

But still I got mild erection in morning...
From some research I finds out that I basically got hard flaccid problem...
I no more wants to raise my Bp for these problems...
Hopefully my whole body is ok ...
All problem is in reproductive organ...this made a huge relief...
Now I am thinking that I will become monk so that no more stress tension to this 20 year old boy...


My lessons ---- Never complain about your problem...just accept it...how fast you accept..the less loss you will get..

I went to more than 8 urologist for my discomfort in testicle...last urologist finds out I have prostatatis...but he gives me poison fluoroquinolones...

I loose Trust in medical science...

DOCTORS ARE JUST WANT YOUR MONEY...

"I grew up with two abusive older siblings, emotionally and physically. My dad, though rarely aggressive, was also emotionally and psychologically abusive. He was my rock when calm but passed away when I was young. My mom abandoned me, leaving my young siblings to raise me without care. They struggled themselves, and I had no guidance as a child. I have grown to be sort of thankful that at least I didn't have it way worst like others, yet these are things that I just don't know how to cope with and have just realized now that I'm an adult and parent.

I feel rejected and unheard by those around me. My actions bring sadness to loved ones. I hide my problems to avoid causing more pain. Being myself leads to criticism and isolation. I'm overlooked even when I'm present. I'm in a severe crisis—lost my job, strained my 10-year relationship, and lost my family. Love seems conditional on meeting others' expectations.

I'm torn between being myself and receiving love. I care for my family and friends, but I fear their reproach and criticism. My economic struggles add to my instability, impacting my peace in various aspects of life. I'm back living with my mom and abusive brother. We've worked to improve our relationship and are somewhat closer now. My routine is chaotic; I left school due to focus issues, harming my grades. I'm gaining some weight and constantly fatigued, preventing me from enjoying my passions.

I'm the ""funny smart guy,"" often overlooked unless entertaining. I struggled with anger in the past, now managed through therapy. I've lied to avoid conflict and faced unforgiving reactions. A toxic relationship led to isolation; everyone left my life except for one forgetful best friend who has consistently shown empathy. My connections are one-sided; I initiate every interaction. I've tested this; a month can pass without anyone reaching out. It's consistent across contexts: college, work, church, groups. No one wonders about my absence. 

 I want to share more, but it's overwhelming."	TheXCube2303	post	27.481005890855783	male	White	0.8061178922653198	na	na	na	2	depression_help

"My whole life I've been led to believe that if you need comfort or encouragement, you're weak. I've even got people in my life right now that are adamant in their belief that comforting or consoling someone is just fostering an unhealthy relationship. It's like they're mortified of co-dependency or something. 

Honestly, I feel like with a little comfort from someone I can trust, I'd be able to make at least a little progress. Feel at least a little better. Is that such a bad thing to want? Is it really that unhealthy to just want someone to be there for me? Someone to confide in? Someone to help me get back on my feet after a bad day? It's not like I wouldn't return the favor. Heck, I'm not even asking for a romantic relationship. I just... want a friend. Is that so wrong?"	seyOdys	post	27.271456721625242	female	White	0.9870518445968628	na	na	na	3	depression_help

"I'm done. For the most part I have just given up on trying to be happy, on doing stuff I want to do, on finding a suitable path to take. For background I have been through one of the single worst breakups of my entire life. I thought she was meant to be the one that I spend the rest of my life with but that is not to be now. I was suffering with issues such as mild depression before she left me but it was one of those things that it was all ok as I still had her at the end of the day. Now I don't. I don't have anyone else I can turn to for help or to just talk to. I'm constantly tired all the time yet can't sleep, I haven't had a single day since it ended that I haven't either had a drink or cried or both. I don't even know what I want out of life anymore as I'm too scared to try make plans incase they all just getting taken away from me again. I'm on a uni course that I'm beginning to loathe but I feel as if I have no other option in life but to complete it. The worst part is I know exactly why I feel the way I do but it won't go away and I'm not in a bad enough position to go bother the doctors and even if I was I wouldn't anyway. My chest is tight a lot of the time, my Blood pressure is through the roof, I have ringing in my ears and everything feels numb. Like my fingers aren't my own. I keep having the same reoccurring nightmare of me having my own newborn daughter and she's sitting asleep in my arms and then as I stir someone comes and takes her away from me and I wake up in tears. I want everything to go back the way it was when I was actually happy for the first time in about 5 years. I was in an awfully toxic relationship beforehand and my now ex helped me get out of it and showed me that I didn't need to put up with the emotional blackmail I was getting on a daily basis, and then we got closer and now we are further away than I could ever possibly imagine. I don't even like waking up In the morning as everything feels like one big disappointment after another and that this is going to be the rest of my life. Just stumbling around for another 50 years trying to find some form of purpose and happiness and inevitably failing.

"I don’t want to be here anymore. I’m not a person with a life. 

  
I do things to distract myself in the hope that time will pass by faster so I can experience those couple hours of silent bliss (from 11pm to 2am) away from my family so I won’t burden them with my issues. During those hours, nobody expects anything from me. I can sit there and stare at my computer screen and nobody will question me. I can watch streamers online and I’m just another person adding to their view count, there’s no commitment because they don’t even know I’m there. I can play video games and completely lose myself in them until I have to drag myself to bed to go to sleep. 

  
I crave sleep too because I’m dreaming and my dreams have been so vivid this last year that I want to sleep so I can dream to escape this life and be thrown into a new one. I don’t have to take care of my kid because she’s asleep during these hours. I can be quiet without having to talk to anyone, because if my husband is out here and I’m not talking to him then he’ll know something is wrong and we both know nobody wants to hear what’s wrong with me. 

I wait for those couple of hours from the moment I wake up until it hits 11pm and the house is quiet. I sleep a lot, yet I don’t have the energy to clean or to play with my kid. I hardly brush my teeth anymore, I don’t see the point, I truly don’t give a shit about myself and honestly I just forget to brush them. I shower occasionally and never do my laundry, all my clothes are wrinkled and smell, like I give a fuck. I eat and eat *and eat*. I feel small bits of happiness when I eat because the food tastes good, so why take away something that makes me happy? I’m almost 200 pounds when I’ve been 120 my whole life and it has been fucking with me very badly. To the point where I can’t see family or meet new people because of how I look. I hate leaving my house because I feel like people don’t see me, they just see my weight. 

I don’t even know who I am anymore. I look at myself in the mirror and I hate the person looking at me. She’s fat and she’s ugly and she hates herself. She’s a horrible wife and mom and she can’t tell anybody about any of this. She wants to die. Existing makes her so fucking exhausted. Even though she doesn't *exist*, her life is just full of waiting. 

And since I'm being honest, I really do hope someone reads this. I'm not even posting on an account that's hidden because I don't talk to anyone about this and I desperately hope someone will notice me. Not to message me or anything, but to just *know* I'm going through so much. I often hope someone will get on my computer and go snooping through my google docs and just see the hundreds of pages I've written about feeling like this. I Just want someone to see me.

I lost all the good years when my daughter was a toddler to depression. I wish I could turn back time and not be depressed and enjoy this wonderful age of hers. My husband didn’t believe in depression because he didn’t know what that is. Neither did I. But I had it and it clouded everything good in my life. For me everything started from a decision, that there has to be another way (after my treatment with antidepressants failed) to be happy and enjoy life. How others can and I can’t. I consciously made a lot of changes in my life and in my mindset, and I have been working on myself for years to figure it all out. If you need someone to talk to I’m here for you.

"I am so sorry that so many are going through this today. I also went through a very dark period in my life when my only grandson died of SIDs when he was 4 1/2 months old. I couldn't face people. I didn't want to have to put on that mask of showing people that I was ok...I wasn't ok I was definitely in a deep dark pit that I had dug for myself and was just not able to cope with people, or even myself at that time. I (like you mentioned) looked at myself in the mirror one day and ask myself--""What are you doing? You have a family who loves you and needs you. You have never been a quitter. Sooo what are doing wasting your precious time in this life by not searching for the happiness that is out there for me and my family???"" I remembered my mom's famous saying--""You can't expect things to change in your life if you just keep doing the same things over over. YOU HAVE TO BE THE CHANGE!"" For me, that meant a Life Directional Change. I had to get out and be with other people, NEW people, people I did not know. I chose to get back into the church. And what I found was that they really wanted nothing from me, but for me to find Joy in my life. They actually wanted to help me to get back to a meaningful life full of Joy and happiness. One that I felt loved and gave love to others. 

Maybe it's time for you to reach out and find a way to get back to happiness and joy in your life again. You could try counseling or finding a group to help you talk out all of your unhappiness. There is a FREE Program offered in our area called ""Celebrate Recovery"". You can web search it for more info and see if the Program is in your area. My friends who have reached out in this way during the darkest days of their lives have told me they really don't know where they would be today if not for their Celebrate Recovery Family.

"I love you. Thank you so much for writing this down. 

This rant might be the best thing I've read in a while. It describes many of the issues I am working through (even though in my case, it's about being too scrawny and thin, and not about being fat, but I've also had periods of time when I wouldn't go out or meet new people because of how I looked).

OK please read the next paragraph. The rest is just my own rant:

If life is pointless, then the things that annoy you are pointless as well, and committing suicide  to escape things *you believe yourself to be pointless* is perfectly absurd. Whenever I think about suicide, I think about this guy who survived a jump off the golden gate bridge. His whole body was broken by the impact, but he survived in one piece. He said: ""the second I was in the air, I realized that all of my problems were solvable, except for what I'd just did"".

&#x200B;

A life full of waiting... that's how I feel as well. I also paradoxically hope someone will bring down the walls I have myself erected around my life. I shun friends and loved ones away, but hope they'll still push. 

I am on this reddit page right now because this is my ""seeking help"" account, and I need to get organizized again (like Travis Bickle says in Taxi Driver, bad inspiration but I like the word). I've got things on my plate that I'm putting off and it's driving me nuts.

"I have been struggling with depression and anxiety all my life. I don't have much to show for my life. If anything at all. On Monday night, my partner and I broke up. She had been struggling to deal with my depression, I had withdrawn a lot. I called myself pointless and insignificant. We had a fight about things moving too fast months ago and I left to sleep on my dad's couch because I thought I wasn't good enough for her. Since that night we have been very rocky and she feels like the person I was had gone away and replaced with this depressed, isolated, self loathing, insecure person. She tried to fix things but I was so scared and lost that I couldn't see it. A few weeks later. I was a bit better and I was trying to fix us. But she was so confused If she wanted to continue. Monday night she said I should go and give her space. But I kept asking if this was it and she couldn't give me a straight answer. And I like the fool I am kept pushing and pushing for an answer that I just made it worse. During that whole thing. I pulled a knife on myself. But I couldn't do it. I tried to cut myself but I couldn't break the skin. She stopped me. After a few hours of going around in circles. She asked me to kiss her and hold her. I did. She didn't want me to go. But she said she thought it was best. And since then she has told me she loves me and cares about me many times.
We don't always talk. But she sends me a ❤️ at night before bed and another every morning when she wakes up (including this morning a hours and a half ago)

She even said she loves me and misses me.

Now I'm sleeping on a couch at my dad's. I have no bed. I have no home. I have no safe place, I don't have her. I only have a bag of clothes I managed to get together before leaving. Everything else I own is still at what was our house. 
I just want to go home. I want to make things right. I just want to be with her.

I'm taking meds. I started seeing a psychologist this week. 

I don't know what to do. I think of self harming. I think of falling asleep to exhaust fumes. 

I tried to cut myself again yesterday morning with scissors I find in the bathroom. But they were too blunt.

I want things to go back to how they were. But I feel they won't. So I want things to end."	All-Sloth	post	24.190886970752786	male	White	0.9807331562042236	na	na	na	5	depression_help

Don't know if this helps, but I'll just state some facts about my experience.  I've suffered from anxiety and depression for years.  At your age, I was homeless for brief periods on time. I'm now 59 and a well established real estate investor worth about 8 million net worth. I worked through depression to the point where I would have to hide in a public restroom or in my car, hiding my tears for as long as 2 hours at a time.  Money has not cured my anxiety/depression, but by embracing and accepting the reality of my condition and working through even when I didn't feel like it has paid off tremendously.  Do not rely on motivation to make things happen because it will most likely stand you up more than half the time.  Just keep keeping on, and you will reap the reward eventually.

I'm sorry to hear you're jammed up right now, friend. Try and be kind to yourself.  Ultra black and white thinking leaves no room for grace. Instead, remember that almost everything is on a bit of a scale, and never quite as we perceive it. I haven't had to experience divorce, fortunately,  but I know how bitter it can be.

But the problem is asking for validation gets you either ignored or just with a comment which is nice I appreciate it but you don't know me and you don't value me because I'm a stranger to you.

I had literally 0 self esteem when I was 15. I didn't have a girlfriend until 22. I didn't become cool until 26. Being young is tough. It gets better when you get older.

"First of all, I feel where you're coming from and no worries, everyone's been there and to continue a little harshly.. You cannot ask US for validation. You know how it is. Its gotta be YOU who provides the validation, not the outside world. Answer me this: Why would you even wanna please some strangers, why would you care about validation from some bambinos you never met, you never cared about? Be real with yourself, life is not drama, life just is. What helped me sooo much, was being real with myself, being rational, talking to myself like I would with my friend or viewing myself from a third person. In time I saw how stupid it is to depend on other people for validation, those people mean nothing, they're irrelevant to my life and their opinion of me doesn't matter. What they think of me is their problem. Other people simply ain't worth it and I believe you should try loving yourself. 

I bet you have the capacity to be an amazing person, I believe you do. You should be amazing for yourself though. It's only you who lives your life, it's only you who sees the world through your eyes and it's only ever gonna be YOU who is truly going to 100 % care about your life. Since you only got one life, since you only got one shot at being yourself, you may as well spend that time loving yourself, working on yourself so it's YOU who is proud of you, not some random idiots on the internet, such as myself. 

Remember, we are strangers, we will tell you what the best thing to do is but it's you who's gotta do the work.. and it's gon take a lotta time, a lot.. I believe you can do it though, you're just 15 and you have SOOO much time to accomplish all you want, so far you have accomplished every day of your life, you got a 100% accomplishment rate so to speak. Stay true to yourself, depend only on yourself and remember that you ain't need to please other people, you ain't ever need to please anyone other than yourself, you're a free human being with a freedom of choice and thought. Aint a reason to be sad, you're alive, you got yourself, you got time, you got friends, you got so much opportunity, so much to experience and if you decide to, you can spend it being happy. Another thing to remember is that it's you who has the strength to decide, you are responsible for every decision of yours, be that wearing make up, pleasing or not pleasing people, etc. You also got the power of controlling your own emotions, you are in charge of your mind, it's the only thing you can control. Your mind is you, only you can control yourself. You can't control other people but you can control YOU. That means your emotions, your decisions, your actions, it's all on you and it's all your responsibility. The way you react defines your emotions, so control your reactions and you will be set for life.

What I'm trying to say is essentially, screw other people, you matter, only you can truly help yourself and remember to be amazing, loving, caring to yourself. As I said, bet you're a great person and you can accomplish anything with enough time, reminder.. you got a lot. Hope this helps a lil bit."		reply	na	na	na	0.9994544386863708	weak	no	no	na	depression_help
"Ok. Serious response. Don't give ANYONE nudes. Your body is a vital, sacred part of your being, only meant to be shared with your committed husband. Men of any age asking for nudes is creepy, disrespectful, and like you suggest, illegal. You have the right to be respected and safe.

So, you are young. Being young is hard.

The good news is you have time to learn and grow.

Keep your mistakes to a minimum, have a plan.

Learn to say no to unhealthy things and people.

Work hard on your dreams. Consistently. Every day.

Because no one will do them for you.

And yes, they are worth it.

Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

Otherwise they will steal your happiness.

Happiness is a choice

You can choose happiness, even when things get hard.

Don't do drugs. It never ends well.

You don't need a boyfriend. Especially one who can't commit. Wait for the right guy. You have time.

What's the point of living a life so worthless. Every step forward sets me 3 steps back. The way the world is and the current state of things just has me so stuck, every minor things sets me back so far. I'm not a fighter and I'm tired of fighting while feeling so empty. There's nothing inside worth the fighting, there is nothing worth fighting for. I'm losing my mental health the more and more life goes on, im so numb, I'm just not myself anymore. I use to be so patient and kind and tried my best to be helpful but I'm falling so hard and none of that seems like me anymore, it's effecting my work performance and life besides the fact I just never have energy. I always feel so drained and slow, is it from all the fighting? The fighting with myself, with life?

"a couple of days ago i told my friends who i play dnd with that i have depression, and well this started before this but its seemed elevated more after

so a month or 2 ago i noticed that im sitting in discord (were me and my friends usually hang out with eachother) alone most of the time even when the others are online and ik everyone has lives outside this but usually we would say if we werent gonna be around for a day etc etc and now it seems im only able to talk with them when we play dnd together and i dont really get to socialise with them anymore.

and now i feel as if its something ive done because even if i do talk in the channels i barley get a response now, and i have them on steam and i see them playing together on games that i had previously played with them and its just a cycle of thoughts did i do something?, are they replacing me? am i so much of burden that they rather set up an entire new server or group chat without me just so they can play together without me knowing? it feels like ive been abandoned by them."

So I’ve been wanting to post in some kinda chat for a while but I didn’t know really what to say but nows the time. So I’ve been battling with depression for most of my life and my depressive thoughts have been mainly focused around self harm. I’ve been in a relationship with my fiancé for a little over a year now and my thoughts now focus solely on me breaking up with them over and over again. It’s gotten so bad that I have had breakdowns feeling totally lost and defeated. I feel like I’m going a bit crazy or that no one else has felt this before. I know that’s not totally true. Just I’m at a crossroads and I don’t know what to do. I’m just looking for advice on what I could do to help with this or just if you’ve had experience.

"Your depression will go after the things you care most about and lie to you about them. Creating positive self talk can be very helpful to combat these negative thoughts. Reminding yourself that your fiancé loves you. That you have created and will continue to build a beautiful relationship with them. You could write down a list or mantra to tell yourself when you have these negative thoughts to help pull yourself out of it. As well as combatting the negative thoughts directly. So when you find yourself thinking these things, you stop, breathe, and tell yourself that that thought is not your own. That thought of you two breaking up is a lie. It will not control you any longer. 

It comes down to seeing that your depression is a liar. I sometimes picture it in my head as this tiny little thing that likes to attack my weak points. But I know my conscious is the bigger person and can overpower it. So I see myself putting my depression in its place. Sometimes depression is old trauma we haven’t worked through fully yet coming back so I acknowledge it as such and try to understand why it’s telling me these thoughts. Like an adult listening to a child. It’s a balance of course in understanding what are outright lies, and what might be a sign of things you need to overcome internally.

"I tried killing myself an hour ago and I’m just thinking of ways to do it where I can finish. I tried hanging but I keep gasping for air and not being able to finish. 

I have, ADHD, OCD, PTSD (for two things), anxiety, depression, anarexioa, insomnia, and germaphobia. 

I was with my wife for 11 and a half years. We split back in may and I just moved to my hometown. I’m on disability and have no job. I’m on the hunt but it’s tough. 

I was molested when I was 5. I’ve had over 20 suicide attempts. 11 of those attempts were in the last 3 months. I’m 28 years old. 

I can’t do this anymore. I’m feel like I’m out of options and I can’t go on. I’m done. I didn’t think I’d live past my mid early twenties and I have. I don’t know what to do. 

I had my dream, white picket fence type house, a wife, planning for kids. And I hated it. It was so much pressure and it was pressure for something I didn’t even want, that I thought was my dream and I was lucky enough to have it at 27. Now I live in a bachelor apartment with my dog and he’s the only reason I’ve lasted these past 3 months but today he’s not even keeping me here. And I feel bad cuz I promised I would never leave him but I’ve been far past my mental limit for far too long. I just can’t do it anymore."

The dream you speak of is one that is implanted in all of our heads. It’s not what we all need or want at all.

I have anxiety and depression (obviously or I wouldnt be in this group),  lately it has been worse due to life. We all face bullshit here and there.  I really only have 2 friends. One online who lives nowhere near me. He has been so helpful so many times. My other friend is usually very busy.  There are times where, when im alone and its 3am, everything is just too much. Like i need a break. I try to distract myself with music. Do all of you ever feel like this?  Im already on a mood disorder med. I think just recent events in my life trigger everything.

I’m so very sorry that you are in this dark place. I‘ve been there too. It overwhelms the senses, and it takes certain partial truths and distorts them into a totally false reality. The distortion is so loud right now that it has deceived you into believing that you have no value. That is a lie. You are a caring, introspective, intelligent, humble person. You have insights, interests, thoughts, skills, and talents that are unique to you. This hurting world needs you at your best. Guided meditations for self worth can help to provide a new perspective, and can bring peace to the mind. There are numerous guided meditations for self worth on YouTube. You are definitely not alone in feeling this way. If you search “guided meditation for self worth”, you will find some great meditations. The fist ones that come up on the list from the MindfulPeace channel are very good (I tried to provide a direct link, but it’s not working). You should also read some of the comments under the meditations, I think that they may help you. You are in a very dark space right now, but there is light and support all around you. You can live your very best life. You can create a new mindset, many of us have. I pray that you come to see your value and that you find peace and deep meaning in this life.	shaggyzoinksss	reply	na	na	na	0.9992675185203552	strong	strong	no	na	depression_help

"Envision the person you want to be. Find A realistic goal so you can find a path to making it possible. Try to take a small step every day towards that goal if possible. Make that your top priority and treat it like it is your top priority.

Own those small steps, tell yourself “I may hate myself and I don’t know how to change it but I accomplished *insert daily goal* “. You can validate your emotions while acknowledging something you did towards your goal. No reason to hate achieving, you don’t have to feel amazing after doing something like the dishes if you don’t want it, yet I imagine you hate dirty dishes over clean dishes.

Look up cognitive behavioral therapy. Self hatred is hard to justify when you have facts to prove it wrong.

It's literally a bad idea to end life...life is filled with major possibilities you just need to find one just like I'm doing. If you think I don't get suicidal thoughts in my mind that's why I'm saying this but I have them too . Instead of ending life I would like to fight with my problems even it'll take years . All you just need to feel good and positive is some good people around you. Thanks for reading	8484041315	reply	na	na	na	0.0014923595590516925	no	strong	no	na	depression_help
"I (25F) am struggling. I dont know what is wrong with me. I feel as though I should be happy and full of life but constantly want to cry. I feel alone and empty and have no idea what im doing wrong in life. 
I know depression, been there. But this time is differnt. I can be euphoric, conquoring the world happiest ive ever been. Next... im questioning my worth. Doubting what i have to offer the world.

I dont have many friends and therapy is expensive as heck. So im just stuck and looking for some inspiration. 

Not sure exactly what my goal of posting this is... but anyone else feel that way? Is this something everyone deals with, can we talk about this? what do you do to dig yourself out of that funk? I need this to stop. I guess share your stories, give advice...  I just want to be okay for more than a day, please?"

""Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great  
You'll never be great, not because you're not, but the hate  
Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith ""

"I am very impressed in this subreddit I encounter many people like me, do you know why you can't verbalize? I was like you when I was more young, and until now I am like this, If you are like me, is because you are more intuitive I am certain? You keep seeing others verbalizing without worrying, but you think you have too much difficult...
I give you an advice... don't force yourself, focus on what is more important, your soul talks in many ways non verbal, if you are like thus, thought occurs after, when you get older more verbalized you will be, but still would be difficult.

"Brother I gotta get this off my chest. And I'm sorry to bother you. 

I failed, as a partner, as a man, and as a dad. A year ago I put my family in financial ruin by making poor decisions that weren't well put together. Since November I have fought tooth and fucking nail to keep our heads above water and flash forward to today I'm fucked. There's no amount of hard work I can put in to make things work. I'm never home, I sleep when I'm there, Lilly balls her eyes out when she can't see me. 

When I came back to fedex I and Kristina both were working and trying to make it, I was working two jobs she was working one and trying to get high paying copy gigs. But everything keeps falling apart. 

I don't know what to do anymore, I'm so upside down on my car that it won't even matter if I trade it in. And better yet I'm fucked bc I live in BFE with no rides and the repo man was at my driveway today. I needed ops more than I could ever say but I don't think it's going to come soon enough. And if I lose the cars I'm royally fucked. 

And this is by no means a request for money bc I have ZERO way to pay you back and I already owe my mom 4 grand. 

Buddy I'm tired of fighting. I don't feel like there's a point anymore. But for all things brotherly please dont tell Kristina a single fucking word of this, she already has so much on her plate and i dont think she could handle knowing the depth at which her partner is baf off."	balltistic78	post	28.21947311449587	female	White	0.9981990456581116	na	na	na	1	depression_help

"I AM AT A LOSS PLEASE HELP

I don’t necessarily know where to start or how to properly describe my feelings but I really don’t feel real or like myself anymore. I feel I have symptoms of so many mental disorders and issues and physical problems that it’s making me go insane. No i’m not obese, i’m not mentally insane, i’m not schizophrenic, i’m just lost. I stare in the mirror and have a hugely strange feeling that i’m not looking at myself. Every day feels like i’m going on autopilot. Every single day is stress filled with high blood pressure and anxiety. Even when I have absolutely nothing to worry about, I still worry about anything and everything. I feel nobody appreciates me and I never receive gratitude, recognition, love, compliments, etc. On the very rare occasion I receive such a statement from someone it doesn’t feel real. I never believe or convince myself that the person means what they say. The only emotions I feel are Joy, sadness, and anger. All lasting oddly short amounts of times (except anger, kinda corny but it’s true). When i’m not feeling these, i’m completely numb. The most annoying things might have absolutely no affect on me, or the tiniest things may cause me to lose my shit. It’s always random. I cannot see my future as I feel like I wouldn’t be alive for it. It’s hard to describe. I don’t mean suicide, or that I’ll be murdered or anything. I just can’t fathom the thought of my future (i’m 17). I don’t want to kill myself, but I don’t necessarily want to continue existing. I fear death, but at the same time I have frequent feelings that i’m already satisfied with my life. I’ve lost my virginity, i’ve excelled at my hobbies, and i’ve lived a good childhood. That’s enough for me. I see no interest in almost everything. There are probably less than 3 or 4 things I truly care about in this world. I also have weird connections with people. I have friends, and I have family. However, I feel that anybody (besides my parents) could walk out of my life and I wouldn’t care. It’s happened, and when it does, I have absolutely no drive to keep in contact. I don’t care if my friends stop talking to me. If anything I prefer that. I have no desire to meet new people unless it will assist me in something i’m trying to do (Not a good thing, I know). If someone’s willing to read this far, I apologize for jumping around so much, I just have to much to say that i’ve never told anyone. Some last things are anxiety and other mental things. Almost every night, I have feelings of “impending doom”. I cant describe it, but if you google it you’ll receive a good explanation. It’s scary, and I have no idea what’s gonna happen. I’ve had this feeling almost every night for 2 and a half months. I’m sick of it. Sometimes I get a couple heart palpitations in a row. I fear it’s a heart attack coming but I never have arm or neck pain alongside it. The feeling I get in my chest is the same as a “sinking heart” similar to when you fall a far distance, or are opposed with severe danger. The rush and sinking feeling in your chest during those situations are what I feel frequently. It seems to have no cause. It just happens when it happens, only at night, for the majority. I am in a constant worry for my own well being and live in an anxiety-filled life. If anyone has any insight on what’s causing even a single thing i’m feeling, let me know please."

" I've fought depression my entire life. The longer you are comfortable with where you are, the worse it will get. Your brain is like a sponge it needs food and new information to thrive! Drugs and therapy can help, but they only treat depression without getting to the avtual cause.
t's all about finding the root of the problem and understanding your brain chemistry. We all need physical and mental stimuli to keep a balanced serotonin level. If you just sit around and stare in a mirror or at a wall all day and expect things to change, they won't. My depression comes from my interpsection, and sometimes, i find myself doing this. The more I sit around and think, the more depressed i get. So trust me, I know a little about what you described. The hard part is, no matter how bad you feel or unmotivated you are, you have to force yourself to do the opposite and do something to boost that serotonin.  Watch something funny, do something productive, or go play with your dog(if you have one). People watching is always good for me as it grounds me. If you can't do much physical activity, going to a mall or where there's people interacting is very good therapeutic things I do to get my mind off the negativity. The truth is, the smarter you are, the more you probably think about how messed up things are, and it becomes overwhelming.  At least, that's where I come from personally with my depression. I hope this helps."	Current_Instance_875	reply	na	na	na	0.9967382550239563	no	strong	no	na	depression_help
I am so sorry you're feeling like this, I know exactly what you're feeling, I had that doom feeling for years and its hard to explain to people because you don't know why you're feeling like that. Most of my mental health issues are from PTSD so I knew why I was depressed but couldn't explain why I was feeling this impending doom all the time, I knew I was safe now but it didn't stop the feeling that something bad was gonna happen, for years I couldn't relax because as soon as I let my guard down it would happen, it was like sitting at the top of a roller-coaster waiting for the drop. When I was 17 I thought the same thing, I'm not gonna be here for long, I didn't want to be here, I would always think about how I would die, I didn't want to hurt myself but would think of things that would happen to end my suffering. I know it can be hard and it breaks my heart knowing others are feeling as low and stuck as me. For years I tried to ignore everything but it just got worse, I was 25 before I really started to work on it, I know my issues are different and stem from my bad childhood. I wish I could say something to make it all go away but that's not how it works, it's going to take some time and work. I know it seems pointless but trust me you don't want to wake up in 20 years and be in the same place you're in now, I'm 36 now and just starting to see that there is a place for me here.I know It's going to sound dumb but one of the best things I ever did was to start listen to my inner child, they knew how to live in the moment. I would look into inner child work, you can find some youtube videos(or other platforms, I'm old and only know about youtube lol) I think it could help you. I also started listening to guided positive self talk videos. I know it sounds like it wont help much but if you keep up with it everyday you will start to notice a small difference. I try to watch things that make me laugh, like the try not to laugh videos, sometimes it takes a few videos before I can crack a smile but keep going until you smile at least once. Also try everyday to find something that makes you smile even if it's just for a second, the sunset, your favorite songs, anything. I hope you start to feel better soon.

At times, the most effective way to offer assistance is by reminding individuals that their identity and ego are shaped by their environment. Past mistakes and wrongdoings can then be viewed as misaligned coping skills or responses to trauma. By helping them grasp this perspective, they come to realize that their inherent purity became encased in protective ego layers over time. While the ego may have served us in our youth as we navigated the world, our personal growth has since enabled us to evolve. Our identity isn't fixed; it can adapt as the world around us changes, granting us profound mental liberation. Dwelling solely on the past hinders progress and can lead to stagnation. To move forward successfully, we must avoid fixating on past events. Understanding that even 'monsters' were once victims, and recognizing that their anger stems from normalized experiences imposed on them, allows us to perceive one another authentically. We emerge as mere pinpricks in the lampshade of God's illuminating presence, artificially separated yet intrinsically interconnected.

I appreciate your reply. I did a little bit of a googling and had no idea that one could be depressed without the feelings of constant sadness and despair. I learned from your response. Something funny is recently i’ve actually been more inclined to pet my dog and watch comedy. Not in particular to my situation i’ve just had subconscious urges to do small things that bring temporary joy. Family guy is my show. It’s just things that require any effort are what I was losing. I’m going to start and try to find newer things that make me more content, requiring effort or not.

Thank you for your response. I know absolutely nobody who is going through/has gone through the same thing to me so I couldn’t turn to anyone for advice. It makes me feel better that what i’m feeling is not unique and can be resolved. I’m not sure if you will read my reply to the other comment, however I stated that I feel my mind is subconsciously trying to get me to watch and do things that bring me joy. It’s as if my subconscious knows what’s happening and my real conscious doesn’t. I’ve been watching family guy, petting/playing with my dog, and eating more since I started back up at the gym. I’m hoping i’ll see improvements with my health soon. Thank you. Best of wishes	Current_Instance_875	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9967382550239563	weak	strong	no	na	depression_help
I read your other reply and it might sound.... silly or whatever but, I think from what I have learned over the years, your inner child is reaching out to you, petting your dog and watching funny shows is exactly what a child would do, I'm glad that you are listening to that voice telling you to do things that bring you joy, even if it's just for a short time, it took me a long time to get to where you are. It can be hard at Times and you might even want to give up on the hard days but those days are the ones you need to do the most for yourself, also have ice cream for dinner once in a while as you watch family guy and pet your puppy. Your best days are still ahead and not that you need or want to hear it from a stranger on the internet but I just want you to know that I am proud of you for not letting this consume you, you are brave and smart and I believe in you.

Ive just given up. The suicidal thoughts have been getting a lot worse. I am not poupular, i am not a all a student, and i dont wanna be alive any more.... i feel like my birth was a mistake.. i just feel like a burden to everyone and i am the worst being to ever be alive. I feel as if i dont have a place in this world, and that im just a weak little girl who has suicidal thoughts. I am able to avoid them when i feel happy, but when i feel sad my depression acts up and makes it so hard to even move. I feel overworked, even  WHEN I HAVENT DONE ANYTHING AT ALL! I get bullied so much to the point where i do not see any point in getting put of bed, because its just gonna be the same old day everyday, til the day i die. I'ts just not fair. Other ppl have a perfect life and i have the worst life to ever be lived! I get told by everyone that im beautiful, but i feel like their just taking pity on me tbh.. I hate my life.

"Fatigue has been kicking my butt recently, and with it comes the depression and poor hygiene practices. I have struggled with maintaining my hygiene my entire life, but that's not the only problem; I have been unable to feel clean even after I clean my body and wear clean clothes. I can't feel clean and it makes me feel defective and disgusting. 

I assume this problem stems from a few things: depression, sensory issues and a lack of hygiene, skincare and haircare routine. The depression makes me feel dirty and lazy, my sensory issues irritate me very much, and the lack of self-care routine means I have dry skin and I never maintain cleanliness or neatness. 

I am physically exhausted all the time which worsens my depression and makes it near impossible to develop a routine. And as for my sensory issues, they include:

- sensitivity to fabrics 
- hating the feeling of putting on lotion and feeling it go under my nails and be wet and sticky
- being extremely bothered by tough dry skin especially on feet
- hating the feeling of my thick body hair, only being comfortable with shaving and trimming, and getting ingrown hairs and such
- my nose always feels ""full"" and I can never get rid of that feeling or clean it out properly

I also have this obsessive thinking pattern about how everything is dirty and can't be properly cleaned because of the crevasses and other things. I struggle with severe executive dysfunction and can't keep my room and space clean and tidy, my family with whom I live are also a bit messy and the house is often not clean and tidy. 

This inability to feel good and clean after a shower, discourages me even more from showering. I want to learn how to take care of my body properly and how to clean and maintain my room. I really want to feel okay in my own skin and feel worthy of being neat and smelling good. I sweat a lot too. 

Does anyone have any advice on this? I would love to hear if any of you struggle with similar issues and how you deal with them."	Lost-vamp	post	26.740786882678634	female	White	0.9964025020599365	na	na	na	6	depression_help

"Thank you so much for posting this. I’ve been going crazy because this feeling is so elevated in me rn! 

Sensitivity to fabrics: only get things that feel comfortable To wear or use. Really know what materials you like. 

Lotion: honestly i go between lotion and oil. I like sweet almond oil bc it makes my Skin soft. Olive oil is good too, i go between those. but I keep my nails suuuuper short with a silver or steel or aluminum nail file. Not like the ones at the salon. 

Tough dry skin on feet: put sweet almond oil on them. Then put socks on.  Then go take a shower and let Your skin get softer with warm or
Hot water.  then exfoliate them with a callus wand thingy. Idk what theyre called pumice thing? Not a rock but its almost like a file and it comes with a long stick.  Its like sandpaper. Dont sand all your skin away be gentle. Take a couple of days if you have to. Eventually you will be like holy shit walking is supposed to feel like THIS ?
don’t use  sweet almond oil
After you softened the tough skin. You can use olive oil after that if you needa moisturised but ya sweet almond softens  skin. 


That’s where i can help ya! Ugh also yeeeeeeessss, i totally relate to feeling like everything is dirty bc of crevices stop 😭😭 if i can i’ll clean it a little, if not i just stare at it and deep breathe and i’m like “i can’t clean you but i wish i could. And its okay. And i’m not gonna die because this thing isn’t  perfectly clean. Will i hate it? Sure. Will i leave it alone? Only because i have to” and then i distract myself.  


The most important things to be clean are the things YOU come directly in contact with. Like if you walk a certain path on the floor after you shower, clean that part of the floor only. Not the whole Floor but only where you know you walk. That’s just one example but yes like. Just focus on  that and try to make it work for you. I know its hard because you live with others. But working small helps a lot.

I do obsess a lot about the thought of how everything is so dirty and imperfect and how I too am dirty and dry and nothing feels good etc. I also ruminate A LOT about moral issues and how I fail to have the perfect brain when it comes to my own strict moral code. I have quite few of these experiences and they make me absolutely miserable and physically exhausted, however, I haven't noticed a pathological compulsion in my behavior. I'll try to remember to mention this to my therapist soon.	Lost-vamp	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9964025020599365	no	strong	no	na	depression_help

My boyfriend has been going through some withdrawals by getting off a medication and starting a new one. He's been pretty down lately saying he wants to die and how he gives up on everything :/ I'm trying so hard to help him through this and it's taking such a huge toll on my mental health. He won't even try calling the doctor to tell them his new medication isn't working and I just don't know what to do anymore.

I have chronic depression after having a child and I do not care about anything. I feel like a robot when I do normal house chores. I don’t care if my sink is full of dishes or the laundry piles up or my yard is overgrown and nasty. I’ve  become aware of this in the past few days and I want to care again, have a good amount of pride. How or where or when do I start to care again?

I really think there's something wrong with me. I used to be such a happy go lucky kid and teenager, but around the 17y/o mark everything's just gone downhill. I've lost a lot of emotion, it's so hard for me to want or feel about a lot. I used to be so sad and suicidal, but now I just feel emotionless. It's so Hard for me to talk to my friends because I just go brain dead. Literally no thoughts and it's destroying a relationship that I don't want to lose. Where should I go to get help? Should I go to my doctor and seek some sort of diagnoses for depression or something else? I feel normal physically but mentally I'm so fucked up.

I can tell you as someone who has tried to commit suicide multiple times that as soon as I do the thing to try to commit suicide, regret hits me and I realize I shouldn’t have done that and don’t want to be gone forever. I know that depression can cause a lot of pain I deal with that as well, and it can be hard but is it worth being gone forever, and never getting a chance to do the things you want? I was lucky enough to survive but not everyone is. Another thing depression can do is cause you to have bad thoughts and it makes you think their your thoughts but you have to remember that it’s depression making you think that way. Please hold on to the thought of the people that love you and that you love, and how much they would miss you if you were gone. Maybe try talking to a professional or instead of doing something permanent try to figure out how to help the problem whether it’s doing things you enjoy, spending more time with friends and family, or getting professional help, or taking certain stressful things out of your life.

Talk to people around you, dont hold it in. That makes things worse in my experience. I have people who love me too and when i get suicide ideation, I try and think that I am loved, and Im going to die anyway so why not spend the rest of this shitty world with the people i love? Once youre dead you wont ever see them again most likely, so I try to use that to keep me going. Love can be as strong as depression.

Currently going through a rough patch…Made some mistakes in my past which cost me pretty much all of my friends. My life completely flipped upside down. I knew I needed to change so I’m doing what I can to be better. Past couple months I’ve been taking my faith more seriously, growing with God…which as been amazing and Idk if i’d be here without Him…but I can’t help but have those moments where I’m reminded of what I did, what was lost, and how different and lonely life is now; And in those moments I feel so defeated and hopeless. Any advice for someone who feels like they screwed up so bad that they may never recover? I can’t help but feel like I don’t deserve to be happy, that I am not a good person.

"Hi guys.  I am 21F, been experiencing episodes of severe depression since Fall 2021.  I am diagnosed with major depression, generalized anxiety, OCD, c-PTSD

I am really struggling right now.  Last Wednesday I started doing very bad mentally.  My moods have been extremely erratic.  Severe irritability, and agoraphobia.  Severe anxiety and panic attacks when faced with going to work.  Really out of it and confused, also super distressed 24/7, almost dysphoric.  Horrible depression and suicidal ideation. Although my girlfriend hid the pills I was having urges to take so I am more or less safe.  I don’t feel like I have a future or I can make it another day.

I am also experiencing physical symptoms.  Moderate to severe lower back and abdominal pain.  I am about to start my menstrual cycle so it’s likely PMS - I have also suspected PCOS.  I have referrals to a psychiatrist and gynecologist I haven’t scheduled yet.  My back is so painful I can hardly walk or move comfortably, let alone do the lifting my job requires.  

These physical symptoms are really adding to my distressed mental state.

Yesterday I missed work due to having a crazy depressive/anxious episode when I woke up for work in the morning (I’m in at 6:30 AM).  I don’t know how to describe it but I was kind of out of my mind.  Fought with my partner and just freaked out because I was so scared to go to work. I felt out of control and overwhelmed with anxiety and suicidal thoughts, so I lashed out

Today I had the same panic/depression when I woke up, managed to make it in to work (ran a little late).  I was there for about and hour before the panic attack beat me and I couldn’t hold back my tears anymore.  Talked to my boss (who is very understanding) and went home

I don’t feel like I am functioning at all.  I cannot survive much longer feeling this horrible.  I don’t know what treatment to seek, I am so scared of going further into medical debt (I am in medical debt from prior hospitalizations).  I will not be able to see the providers I have referrals to for several weeks, and I feel I need psychiatric intervention now. I haven’t had a psychiatrist for months and my current meds (cymbalta) are NOT working

The only thing keeping me going is weed which I am completely addicted to and dependent on.  Definitely contributes to my mental issues.  I also am in the process of quitting nicotine and am about a week vape-free.  Withdrawals kick my ass

The worst part is that I have to switch to seeing my therapist from every week to every other week due to my high deductible insurance ($2000).  Each appointment is $110 and I can’t afford it.  Idk what to do, I NEED to see her weekly for my stability, but I just can’t.  I’m pretty scared about that

Any advice would be appreciate.  Sorry this is so scattered.  I’m calling to talk to my boss at noon, to discuss what my plan is with work and my health failing.  I’m not sure what I’m going to say.  I need to work and make money to provide for myself, but my mind and body is failing me.  I feel like I’m fighting every day just to survive

These issues caused me to drop out of college and ruined my life.  I’ve lost almost all of my friends.  I torture my poor girlfriend with my outbursts.  Education was my passion but it’s all gone up in flames now."	awholelottahooplah	post	33.12837032397237	female	White	0.998633086681366	na	na	na	4	depression_help

"Similar situation -- anxiety so bad I was puking before work, became agoraphobic, and stopped communicating with friends and family.  I have many of your diagnoses, as well as adhd.  At one point, I had to quit my job it was so bad.  Was having panic attacks so frequently that I was afraid of going and seeing my best friends, so I felt like wtf happens if I freak out at work and screw myself worse.  A lot of self loathing and guilt.

I'm still going through it, but it has gotten more manageable.  What helps is finding anything that I have a shred of happiness from.  A shower.  Doing my eyeliner.  Petting a cat.  Taking pictures of nature.  Writing.  I don't always have the focus/spoons to do all these things, but if I can try to just do one thing, it does make me feel better.  Trying to talk myself into things by telling myself I *want* to do the thing instead of feeling like I *must* do the thing has also helped me greatly.  Routine has helped, when I've been able to keep one, as stability creates stability.  Assigning no moral value to things, like trying to make tasks void of good/bad labels, and just seem them all as a harmony of things, has somewhat helped, though I'm describing it poorly.  I have big executive dysfunction issues, and it makes me feel better when I don't clean xyz if I know that dirty xyz doesn't make me a bad person.

Reading self help materials and even following wellbeing videos has helped a lot.  Therapy was helpful, but self-guided therapy has been more helpful, because I feel no one else can understand me better than me.  I'm learning to rely on myself again, even if it is baby steps.

Give yourself grace.  Love yourself.  Don't be hard of yourself.  Cocoon and heal if you need to.  But don't give up.  Keep fighting for yourself.  I know it's tough.  But you can find your happiness and your passion once again.  It's never too late to try again.

If you need to vent, feel free to pm me.  Best of luck, friend.

Edited to add: Quitting weed and alcohol, or anything else you may do, will prove helpful.  I know weed can be helpful,, but a temporary escape only brings the real world back in full force.  Weed can definitely impact mental wellbeing and create mood swings in people who are experiencing mental health crisis. However, I took up vaping nicotine to get through this period of my life, because I find that nicotine does help a little with my depression issues and self harm of finger picking, as well as helping me focus and think more clearly.  However, I do applaud you for being able to quit vaping!"	awholelottahooplah	reply	na	na	na	0.998633086681366	no	strong	no	na	depression_help

"There honestly seems very little to stick around for. 

My mother (British permanent resident, possible citizen - it’s unknown because my abusive father destroyed all her documentation) was supposed to help me get British citizenship before I turned 18, but she died when I was a teenager. I would beg all my family in England to adopt me and take me in but they were also very scared of my father who is high up in the American government. They also didn’t think that his attempts on my life that I would call them about were that important because I found out three years ago that the most they would ever do is call him after I told them and that drove him to even more drastic ways of trying to unalive me, I don’t know if I can write about them here because there isn’t a single instance that isn’t graphic and I don’t want to trigger anyone who has gone through similar.

It’s been 17 years since she died and I kept holding out that things would be better but they never really did, so again, what’s the point? I haven’t seen any of my family at all since around 2011 at a reunion, they told me that as an adult I should have gotten over what happened by now and that because I wanted to ask their side of things during this time of my life that I was too much to deal with. So, I haven’t seen them at all since. I have a nephew that was born in 2011 and I got to see him as a baby but have been robbed of any chance of being in his life because I’m basically shadowbanned in my family and they still want a relationship with my abusive father (he’s rich and would routinely pay for anything they asked of him - ironically, this does not extend to me and never has). 

There honestly doesn’t seem to be any point of sticking around anymore. I’ve seen over 15 therapists, I have a psych, I’ve tried every med under the sun until they told me I had treatment resistant depression. Since then, I’ve tried experimental treatments that also didn’t work. And it doesn’t seem like anything else will work either.

I can’t escape as an American. I took out student loans during Covid out of a stupid fear my family would die (all they talked about during Covid were the daily worldwide death tolls), but the university was perpetually shut down so I owe all this money back for nothing to show for it and my family all stated that they were strictly following lock-down so I never got to see them in the year I was there. I’d made plans with one cousin but she backed out twice. 

I had hope and had been learning Norwegian in the hopes of going there but they just made tuition applicable for all international students (before it was free). I posted on a sub for being a student there and the only advice I received was to stay in the US. 

I can’t do this anymore. I hate it here and I haven’t been happy for as long as I remember. I don’t know what happiness or not having stress would even look like anymore. There doesn’t seem to be any point of being here anymore and it doesn’t seem like there is anywhere I can leave to. I guess the universe is sending me signs that there really is no hope and that anytime I’ve tried to be positive and have hope, I’ve been a total idiot for doing so. I’m sick of this world, I’m sick of society, I’m sick of having zero support group or friends and I’ve been burned too many times by Carrie-like pigsblood occurrences with friends to ever try having them in America ever again.

I feel cursed and forgotten and that I’m truly just hanging around for nothing and waiting on death to pick me up. There’s nothing."	Dad_Feels	post	26.008417637727746	male	White	0.9989013671875	na	na	na	2	depression_help

At times, the most effective way to offer assistance is by reminding individuals that their identity and ego are shaped by their environment. Past mistakes and wrongdoings can then be viewed as misaligned coping skills or responses to trauma. By helping them grasp this perspective, they come to realize that their inherent purity became encased in protective ego layers over time. While the ego may have served us in our youth as we navigated the world, our personal growth has since enabled us to evolve. Our identity isn't fixed; it can adapt as the world around us changes, granting us profound mental liberation. Dwelling solely on the past hinders progress and can lead to stagnation. To move forward successfully, we must avoid fixating on past events. Understanding that even 'monsters' were once victims, and recognizing that their anger stems from normalized experiences imposed on them, allows us to perceive one another authentically. We emerge as mere pinpricks in the lampshade of God's illuminating presence, artificially separated yet intrinsically interconnected.

"Im crying while writing this rn. Tears won't stop falling but here's my situation: I failed a subject on medschoolast sy 2022, i took it again in 2023 and i still failed it. The thing is since 2022 im aware I have anxiety problems, i scheduled a consultation but failed to show up since medschool has been super hectic and ive been using all the time i have to study. Then i failed one subkect which lead me to feel depressed. School year 2023 cane, i took the subject i failed but it became harder than last time so i was 1 point short and failed it. No removals just pure failure and was booted off the program. Now i don't know what I should do. Im stuck deciding with continuing it to another school or studying diploma or masters abroad. I needed suggestions from ny parents, dad didn't want me to go to shool anymore since im already licensed, and he wants me to go to work, mom on the otherhand doesn't know what to do with me. Ive been wanting to talk to them for 2 months but everytime i initiate talking, i always get dismissed. 
Tonight was the last straw, mom decided i continue medschool but today is the last day of enrolment. I have to find a new dorm, move in a new place, have some new uniform. Alot of things to do and I don't wanna rush things. Then she pointed out to me that I should be grateful she's giving me a chance to go to school again (im grateful) but I don't know what happened suddenly our conversation ended up with her telling me that since I came ive done nothing in the house but sleep and play mobile games. I told her im not playing mobile games ,im actually researching for what path I should take, also been job hunting for online jobs, and asking suggestions from my dr. Friends and other adult friends on what i should do since I don't know what to do and the guidance I needed from my parents won't happen. I felt offended. As for the sleeping, i have been sleeping 2/3am since ive been thinking a lot and was being anxious about me, my future. So every time she checks on me, like 7/8am im still sleeping. Also ive been very avoidant lately thus i slept. I also told her I was dx with mod. Depression that's why ive been sleeping and all other sx i have. And she said that ""mental health is not real, depression is wrong.its all on you, If you want to be happy then you'll be happy"". I got offended cause she isn't even making an effort to understand my situation and how I feel. I have alot of things to unpack but where do i unpack it? I've been crying and tears won't stop. My heart is heavy, i feel very misundertood,dismissed and i feel like a burden to my parents. Sorry for the very long post, I just need to vent out .

Girllllll…. I think you should take some personal time off from life for like a week if you can and think about what you really want out of this life you have.

The reason that many employers seek someone with a bachelor’s degree is that attaining the degree demonstrates that the person is intelligent, able to complete tasks, has the ability to understand and process new information, is conscientious, and is dedicated to advancing themselves. Attaining the degree is a major accomplishment, don’t diminish what you have achieved. Remind potential employers of all of these attributes that you possess. Other life experiences can also be valuable to employers. You can list any technology skills that you have, even if it’s basic knowledge of certain computer software or applications. There are other hobbies, interests, and life skills that can be helpful to list. I have hired many people during the course of a very long career. I was always looking for intelligent people who would be trainable, and who would work well with others. You have both of these attributes. You just lack confidence right now because seeking employment makes most people begin to question their true value. You are not alone. You have tremendous value, you just need to develop the confidence to convey it to potential employers. There are some excellent guided meditations on YouTube for anxiety, depression, and self confidence. Stilling your mind through meditation can help you to center yourself, and assist you in effectively communicating your value. There are employers that will be interested in what you offer to them. The important thing is to let them know that you have skills, will work hard, and will be a team player. Don’t let a few rejections stop you. Everyone seeking employment will be rejected. But if you are persistent, you will find work. I pray that your young life is blessed with much love, self confidence, peace, and great purpose.	feelalienated	reply	na	na	na	0.999467670917511	no	no	no	na	depression_help

You have skills. Your work experience is real experience, even if the duration was short. To be certified as a personal trainer is a significant accomplishment. You’ve also managed to endure depression, which is a major life challenge. You are very young, and you‘re at a point in your life where you are seeking direction. You are definitely not alone. You are a unique creation. You have thoughts, emotions, insights, interests, skills, talents, and charisms that can be used in this hurting world. If you sit down and list your abilities over the next couple of days, you’ll find a growing list. I can start you off: you are articulate, you are introspective, you can communicate effectively, you have physical abilities, you have the ability to learn, you want to be of service to others, and you can keep adding to this list. Start to think about how you want to use all that you possess to live your best life. I’m an older person, and over the course of my life I’ve found deep meaning in developing purpose. Life’s meaning is found in being in a daily purpose driven relationship with your values. Your values are things that you believe to be good, beautiful, and true. They are personal, and they go well beyond the pursuit of wealth, honors, power, and pleasure. A useful method of connecting with your values is through guided meditation. There are excellent guided meditations on YouTube on everything from depression to motivation. Meditation can still your mind, center you, and get you in touch with your value system. If practice daily, it can be life altering. You are very young, and you can build the life that you want. Everything that you need is within you, and can be further developed. Don’t be afraid to grow. I pray that your young life is filled with new blessings, love, peace, and deep purpose.	kjaerguard	reply	na	na	na	0.9994794726371765	weak	no	no	na	depression_help

"As a Teenager diagnosed with depression one of the things that makes me incredibly angry and I really struggle with, is the fact that everyone is mindful of your situation for a sec and than doesn’t give a fuck the next.
Everyone just kind of expects you to live your life like a „healthy“ person, to be a functional parttaker in social events and just constantly move. It’s like they just forgot depression isn’t just a diagnose you get on a sheet handed by some doctor, but that it effects me and my life 24/7.

When you say you can’t do something or it’s clear that your struggling, everyone blames you and acts as if your overreacting and just lazy and „hiding“ behind a diagnose.

Than it is my fault for not joining on a trip or not being able to get out of bed like a „normal“ person, but when I am suicidal suddenly everyone wants to help me, apologise and act as if they didn’t see coming, just to act as if I am not really struggling the next morning…

The fact that everyone just seems to not understand depression and put their own situations in comparison to mine, even though they are brutally different, makes me so fucking angry and it just sucks so much to be blamed for something I already struggle with enough as it is."

If you mentioned social workers I can see that there's something fucked up going on in your life atm. I suffered a lot as a teenager and sometimes now as an adult. It's not much information but you are free to keep as many details as you want. I dealt with depression during that time mainly with music but I remember that it never went away, it just diminished. After learning some strategies it got a lot better. It's great that you got the courage to vent it publically, that usually helps. I can't give you more strategies as what you are describing probably has an specific cause but I can say that after meeting people who were in REALLY fucked up scenarios that shit gets better eventually. Find your comfort in something that you like, I know it can feel unbearable but keep it up.

"I have a very low EQ and i can't really help my depressed friends. All I can do is listen to them being in pain because idk what to tell them. But before YOU do anything u can't undo

I'd suggest reading ""A man's search for meaning"". There was section page 84. It goes:
""any attempt to restore a man's inner strength in the camp had first to succeed in 
showing him some future goal. Nietzsche's words, ""He who has a why to live for can bear with 
almost any how,"" could be the guiding motto for all psychotherapeutic and psychohygienic efforts 
regarding prisoners. Whenever there was an opportunity for it, one had to give them a why—an 
aim—for their lives, in order to strengthen them to bear the terrible how of their existence. Woe to 
him who saw no more sense in his life, no aim, no purpose, and therefore no point in carrying on. He
was soon lost. The typical reply with which such a man rejected all encouraging arguments was, ""I 
have nothing to expect from life any more."" What sort of answer can one give to that?
What was really needed was a fundamental change in our attitude toward life. We had to learn 
ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what 
we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the 
meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life—daily 
and hourly. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and 
to fulfil the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.
These tasks, and therefore the meaning of life, differ from man to man, and from moment to 
moment. Thus it is impossible to define the meaning of life in a general way. Questions about the 
meaning of life can never be answered by sweeping statements. ""Life"" does not mean something 
vague, but something very real and concrete, just as life's tasks are also very real and concrete."""	irishwarrior409	reply	na	na	na	0.9990227222442627	no	strong	no	na	depression_help

Without knowing the particulars of your situation, know that nothing lasts forever. The dark ages are always ushered in by the light. Darkness will fade and gives birth to an illuminating light. 

You might feel like there’s nothing to live for right now, but that doesn’t mean in one day or one hour even, that could all change. 

Try doing something different. You could walk to a bookstore or go to a nursing home and ask them about volunteering. Life has options and possibilities- it’s not always easy but it can give you something.

"What are you giving up? Think about it? If you have nothing left, as you say, then just give it a try, whatever it is, what's the worse that can happen? A night before my first interview i had a mental breakdown, i was literally of another branch, and i was going to give an interview of a completely different branch. I was thinking of just not showing up there. But here i am today, waiting for the second round of the interviews in that company. My point is, even if you decide to give up, just give it one more chance, think about it, you never know when an opportunity shows up. Take one day at a time, don't stress about it.

Besides being a happy go lucky girl, i dont feel any of it. It's all fake. I dont feel anything but sadness deep inside. I have so many responsibilities. I get bullied at school, anyone i try to talk to just brushes it off and changes the subject. I am just tired of life. I want to disappear. I just want to die in my sleep and wake up in a better place. A better world. There are so many wars going on for meaningless reasons, and everyone expects me to be super happy because a have a perfect life. I dont. I hate my life. When i wake up, i want to cry. I dont see any reason to even get out of bed because today is just gonna be worse the yesterday and ppl expect me to 'make others first' annd not be selfish. I have so much internal pain and no one cares and no one sees what is behind that fake smile on my face. No one gives a fuck because of a stupid rumour. The only reason my best friend became my best friend became my bestie is because she wanted to get me off another friends hands. I am just so sick and tired of life. So no, i cant 'Just be happy'. I am SICK and TIRED of hearing that shit.	MelissaGirl123	post	20.149878176235003	female	White	0.9992283582687378	na	na	na	5	depression_help

"""Just be happy"" is what people who don't understand depression usually say. Seriously, fuck them, it's easier to ignore them when you grow up and yeah, they tend to stay the same. I think it's a great thing that you found the courage to express all of this publically, as a guy who experienced depression since he was 13 I only started to get better after I externalised it, even a little bit.   


Bullying is another topic, I had to also suffer this and I could get rid of it basically using violence bc I have a big body, I think it would be irresponsible to encourage you to do so but, well, it worked for me, just don't do anything crazy like stabbing someone, just hit them with whatever you can and try to not damage them in any permanent way, they tend to go away once they see you fighting back, even if you are smaller than them a suprise kick in the balls or similar should work, repeat until they leave you alone, the hardest part is overcoming the fear, but what are they going to do, bully you harder? You'll probably get scolded by teachers as they are usually blind to these situation if they aren't clever enough or it can get you grounded but if you are out of options there's that. There's also the option of saying it to a teacher or similar but some are absolute dumbasses and don't pay enough attention. Idk what you've tried but don't let them intimidate you.  


Also  gossiping is bad as hell, I got panic attacks just from rumours/pseudo-cancellation and I was 21 at the time.  


Also forget about the make others first mentallity, at least phrased in that way. You should first be concerned about your well being and second the others around you. If you are depressed it's normal that it's really hard to help others. Just do what you can and that's all. Don't let people tell you otherwise.

I don’t have many people I can do things with to begin with but the people I do have I can probably count on one hand, one of the people is my mom but she’s always busy with work, the other person is my friend but he’s on vacation for 2 weeks and even when he’s not I can only do things with him once a week at most. The rest of the time I’m just alone in my room, I know it makes things worse because I start to get thoughts that people hate me and want me to be dead. I want to have people to go out with but I just don’t really have people aside from that one friend, and I’m to scared to meet people because I fear they won’t accept me because of my mental health issues. I used to go to school at an autism center but I got kicked out because I kept telling the workers there about my suicidal thoughts because I wanted help, but they said “because they are an autism center they are not equipped to help me with that and it was to much for them”. That was a few months ago and now I’m just alone in my room almost all day everyday and depression hurts enough on its own but having no choice but to isolate makes it worse. I don’t know what to do and I don’t even know why I’m writing this, I guess I just feel so lost, hopeless, and alone and don’t know how else to reach out to people.	scartzac00	post	22.690523390441204	female	White	0.9984436631202698	na	na	na	9	depression_help

"Experiencing difficult times, I once again came across the phrase ""Men should not cry.""

But how not to cry if I'm exhausted and don't know what to do next?

I've been living all alone with almost no human contact for about five years now. I need to move to another city which is about 807 miles away from the city where I currently live (\~1300 km in my country's system). And I am very tired of what is happening in the world right now. Why are most people so mean to others? Where is kindness and understanding?

Yes, we are all different. But at the same time, we are all human and we all have feelings, in this we are the same.

I feel like I'm in the wrong place and in the wrong world... I need a reboot. But there is only one way to reboot... And in recent days, I've been thinking more and more about this way of rebooting.

Reading other subreddits and posts, I am covered with horror and panic. There are many people who wish other people dead just because they are from a particular country. But we also have a lot of people who didn't want all this to happen, but those people in the comments want them to die too.

Do I deserve support if I am Russian? Or should I die too? I'm completely confused, I'm scared and I don't know what to do.

I have bipolar disorder, depressive disorder and frequent panic attacks. Was twice in a psychiatric hospital (the first time was there for a month). A significant portion of my income is already going to Clomipramine and Hydroxyzine (because my doctor told me to take them), but they make me ""soft and slow"", those thoughts of rebooting never go away.

I am a musician and am currently developing my game. I have always been for peace and love and still for peace and love. I want people to understand and support each other. But because of what's going on, I'm crying alone at home. And if I start to share with someone, then ""Men shouldn't cry"", ""You're a man, pull your-fucking-self together""...

I just need a reboot. I appeared in a completely different world. Sorry for a lot of text..."	Tony_EZero_Proxy	post	26.535350568369772	female	White	0.014708159491419792	na	na	na	7	depression_help

"Well, as you mentioned that you are russian for what I know the patriarchy rules are a lot more strict. I know a lot of people have phobia to this word but bare with me, I'm not using it as a ""system designed to oppress women"" more like a ""system designed to force x group to do a thing and y group to do another"". From that perspective I don't know how much shit you are taking from others or what repercussions you could face but enough to say that ""men shouldn't cry"" is a horrible premise to begin with, everyone needs to cry from now and then, that aliviates our pain, not doing so is psychologically damaging. I know this might sound naive but if you have enough money try to move with some excuse to a place where you are treated better, at least for a while. Maybe it helps you.

&#x200B;

Other thing that I can address, I met a few russian people recently in foreign countries and they were all bashed bc of the war, I think that this is incredibly unfair and cruel as it's mainly the goverment who has an agenda with Ukraine, the general population is not one to blame and even if there was some kind of consensus among most of the russians that Ukraine sucks it would be stupid to presuppose that just for the fact of being russian you'd be pro-war against them, who the hell cares where you were born, you aren't responsible for the crimes that Putin is commiting or for what Dostoyevski wrote or for what films Tarkovskyi made or you aren't automatically a slav... Don't feel ashamed for that, never. I'm from Spain and we have a long history of fascism and it's still alive, I don't feel blame for that as they are people who happened to be born in the same country as me, and I hate them, maybe ashamed bc they aren't kicked out.

&#x200B;

If you are seeing a lot of death threats and similar I'd seriously encourage you to get out of reddit for a while until you feel better.   


That being said, I also suffer from panic attacks so I know that pain (I was in emergency room a few days ago bc of this) I don't have much experience with BPD, I only know it from my aunt who has it and I know it can be terrible for the person who suffers it.

"The idea of men aren’t allowed to cry is outdated. It came from a generation of men who were told the same shit from their fathers. And surprise, now these older men don’t know how to communicate their feelings. You are more than justified to cry when you need to. And you’re right, this world can be a mean and nasty place. However, there’s still so much good in this world. It gets outshined by the negativity because drama sells and gets attention. You just have to go out and find the good. It also helps to do as much as you can to help create it. 

Perhaps you can find relief in using your music as a way to express this and the idea of kindness to help others see beyond the negativity. 

In regards to the reboot. It can be helpful, however learning to better digest problems in the world and your life might offer more long term solutions for you. So when you’re met with a problem, you can digest it and move on. So the problems don’t continually stack up to where they weigh you down.

i feel burnt out just trying to keep up. My head has been foggy, and to smile or be happy, i constantly need my brother around me to talk about fiction. Like a codependency thing maybe. I cant be alone anymore but i also cant listen to the people around me. My head is a fog or too many things on my mind like

What now, will i be ok?

I keep thinking since were all getting older that if my parents unalive i would just end it there. Definitely codependency. 

I had no friends in highschool. Nobody. Nobody in college either. I had only my family. I relish my time in covid in online school. I had my pets and my dad and my mom and my brother. 

I failed my summer math class and thats it, i really dont want to do that anymore. I forgot the important concepts of math and i dont care anymore to remember. I tried so many times and all my math classes are Bs and now theyre Cs and today i failed. I know it isnt the end of the world but
My head hurts from thinking, the anxiety, the fact that i feel so alone in this, no one to talk to about this. No one who can reassure me in this situation.

I dont want to stand anymore and i keep crying screaming at my pillow i dont want to think anymore. I have no support i dont know any other life other than pursuing the best in academia. 

I want a psychologist to just tell me in the face that im lazy and this is all my fault. Or that i have adhd, social anxiety or maybe diagnose me on the spectrum. But thats not going to happen til october.

"Hi, I'm from Syria, before the war I had a very comfortable normal life, my family made good money, I used to work also as a teenager and I made enough money for myself, I was a freshman in collage when the war broke out, the war hit my life very hard, I had to leave collage before graduating, then I had to work in everything possible in order to provide for my family as both my parents lost their income. A few years ago, I managed somehow to achieve finical stability, I can say I live better than 90% of Syrians, I work very hard. For a short period of time from 2017 to 2019 I found a balance in my life I was not much bothered by the war, it became a normal part of my life. However, in the last two years, despite having finical stability, I began to remember my life before the war more and more, and it is getting worse by the day. I just can't get these memory out of my head, the easy of life, the happens, the innocence, the simplicity of everything, my hopes, my dreams, all of these memories are hunting me every single memory, I found myself remembering games I used to plays, movies I watched, food I ate and even scents I came across, this is every single minute, I can't focus anymore, I lost motivation and all what I want is to set and remember these things, I got back to smoking just because I used to before the war, I spend the rest of my day working out or working. I can't enjoy anything anymore even the small things I used to be happy for like a good meal and a nice movie. All what I can think about is my childhood and teenage years, how relaxed and full of life I was. Nothing now can impress me or make me happy, I can clearly see the absurdity of life, but somehow I can't see it as a positive thing. I can't stop thinking about the past and it is now effecting my life. I'm not sure what to do about it because I fear this would soon morph into something bad in mind. I'm very grateful to be able to secure a living for me and family, but not happy, the responsibility that the war put on my shoulders is killing me from the inside. I'm haunted by my past and I don't know what to do, I think I might be going mad.

Hey man, this sounds like it could be PTSD related. I know rumination on what was lost can be a symptom, even if you aren’t coping with any specific experience that shocked you. I know it isn’t the most helpful, but you may want to look at the CPTSD workbook (you can get a digital copy on Amazon), read up about trauma processing and therapies, and if at all possible touch base with a mental health professional, or even a trauma survivors forum, virtual group therapy, etc.	Imaginary-Rub7416	reply	na	na	na	0.9974090456962585	weak	no	no	na	depression_help

Hello, I am an Italian boy. Since I was little, I have experienced one problem after another. As a child I was often in the hospital because I couldn't balance, I would fall, and I was always bumping around. Once I even hit my head against a chimney, fortunately turned off. Besides that, when I was 3 years old my parents separated. I remember little of my life before that, I only have a vague memory of my father yelling at me and another of the whole family sitting together at the table. My two older brothers grew up in a happy family, and I constantly had to choose between being with my mother or my father. Then at school I was always excluded, always the one in the corner by myself, the last one, ostracized. And it's still like that. I'm tired of it all. I'm tired of making fake smiles at home. I'm tired of making fake smiles school and everywhere. The only friend I had hasn't spoken to me in a few years, I'm completely alone. And sad.

Sorry nobody has reached out to you yet bud. This made me think about something though. Sometimes the universe puts more issues into certain peoples lives because it knows that they are strong enough to handle it. You can only try your best and things will always work out. Not always in your favor but that’s how we grow and learn.	IlSanniX	reply	na	na	na	0.998053789138794	strong	no	no	na	depression_help
"Throw-away account.

I'm not sure if I have depression in the medical sense, but I sure feel depressed.

I'm 42 and I have, what would seem from outside observers, a great life.

I have a career in consulting making a lot of money for someone my age. I have a wife of 10 years and we have two kids (we each came with one from a previous marriage) and our kids are great. I have a nice house. Not a mansion, but nice and good location for us. I have a lot of hobbies that I rotate through over the course of a year depending on the weather and my mood.

All that being said, I feel completely trapped and an ever increasing sense of dread and anxiety every day. I actually hate not just my job but my entire industry and line of work. However, I guess I must be at least somewhat good at it because I keep advancing down this infernal career path and making more money, and our standard of living has increased every step of the way. I'm now at a place where there is zero way to afford what we have if I was to quit my job and try to start over with something completely different. I can only make what I make because I am in this special niche with lots of experience.

I know you're probably rolling your eyes right now and you're going to tell me that I just need to choose what's more important and if we need to downgrade for me to be happier, so be it. But it's not that simple. I cannot leave the city I am in because both of our kids have other parents that we share custody with, and as part of those agreements we must stay in Travis County (Austin). Living in Austin has become expensive and selling our home is not a viable plan right now. If I took drastic measures in cutting out other things like selling our cars and getting very cheap cars in their place, I could maybe reduce our monthly expenses by \~20%? Not enough. I also would hate to put my family through all that stress. My wife works but she makes just a small fraction of what I make.

I have tried so hard to just make work about providing for my family and some days that is enough to get me through but overall I am just running out of steam. The stress of doing something I hate is started to manifest itself as physical pain in my chest (precursor to panic attacks maybe?), bad sleep, and occasional suicidal ideation. I find myself thinking that all of my problems would be so easily resolved if I could just die and it appeared to be an accident: I would be free, my family would get a huge life insurance payout and they would be set. Sure they would be sad, but they would get over it and better that than having to watch me slowly burn down and eventually fall apart in a mental breakdown and probably get fired and have us lose everything...

I do not know exactly how I got here and I don't know how to get out but it feels hopeless."	Howdy_yo	post	33.16176884725246	male	White	0.9991627931594849	na	na	na	1	depression_help

 I've been experiencing anxiety for the past couple of months. Because of that, I rarely go outside or even if I do, I avoid crowded places. Last week, I had an errand to go and needed to ride a bus. The bus was quite full and right after I entered, I had cold sweat, became dizzy and have no choice but to jump off and vomited. Does someone experience the same thing when in a crowded place?

Yes. It’s social anxiety. Your brain is seeing the tasks and people as a threat so it’s throwing you into fight or flight mode for the sake of your “safety”. You have to keep making through the tasks that cause you anxiety because each time you survive it’s retiring your brain to realize the task isn’t dangerous or fatal. Keep pushing through. It’s hard at first but worth it after!	PatientChest9774	reply	na	na	na	0.9989824891090393	no	no	no	na	depression_help

" Hi,

I've been struggling to describe a feeling I get during the most intense phase of my depressive episodes. It's a feeling I get that is, like, an emotion, while depressed is a state or a mood.

It's an achy feeling I get in my chest that kinda hurts. It's not unlike the feelings one gets when they are so sad that they're crying tears.

This feeling comes and goes; when it comes, it does so in decisive waves. Sometimes it's so intense that I want it to end RIGHT NOW by any means necessary (including you-know-what).

In the absence of a name for this, I've decided to call it ""depressive angst"". Does anyone relate?

Also, anything you know that can give some relief? I'm dying here (figuratively)."	am_i_beyond_saving	post	13.786888383109849	female	White	0.010133770294487476	na	na	na	5	depression_help

I don’t know if this is similar but sometimes my depression hits a spot where I’m extra anxious and sensitive? It’s hard to explain but it kind of feels like I’m a glass full of water to the brim and I’m on the edge of the table with maybe only 2 cm actually touching the table. About to fall and crash. I’m not sure if that makes any sense. When I get like this I have to find things to calm me down. Which is very hard, holding something cold/frozen to my chest or drinking cold water. Focusing only on my breathing kind of helps. Sometimes I can’t just sit because it feels like I’m going to explode so I clean. It helps me get out of my head mostly. Sometimes I just need to ball my eyes out. 🤷🏻‍♀️These are my go toos and don’t always work but worth a try. I am actually diagnosed with severe depression, not just someone who gets sad sometimes and calls it depression. That can be important to some people to know so figured I’d clarify.	am_i_beyond_saving	reply	na	na	na	0.010133770294487476	no	strong	no	na	depression_help

I have struggled with anxiety and depression my entire life. Last month my father made an attempt on his life and it sent me spiraling. At the same time I was offered a job in sales which involves a lot of cold calling. I took a month off before starting this job to get in the right head space. I thought I was okay but after my first day I had a complete breakdown. It’s 2 weeks later and I’ve finished training and starting actually calling and my anxiety is so bad I’m breaking down multiple times everyday. I can’t eat, I’m oversleeping, I can’t get out of bed, and it feels like my entire nervous system is in shock. I’m shaking all day. I’m seeing 2 therapists and going to group therapy. I don’t know what else to do. Quit my job and fully commit to mental health? Work the job and fight through? Needing help.

"I don't even know how fucking long my self break is since I'll probably forget about this shit in a few days

My parents and my siblings are currently in a financial crisis and we're just currently living thru the consumption of noodles and rice, sometimes cheap processed food, in rare occasions, maybe some meat and actual food. We also have lots of debts from people that my parents know because we need food and internet access, and travel (My dad needs to contact my mom, and my mom needs to travel to her job everyday except on weekends), The debts made my dad and mom's friends angry at them because of the constant asking for money just to cover our daily budget.

As much as I want to get a job, my parents won't let me have one, considering I'm still in high school on a strand I never even wanted to join because I wanted to be a game developer. but my parents and I had no choice since that's the nearest public school on this shitty area I live on due to us being kicked out from our old house that we rented after the pandemic hit. We just live on a free house my mom's friend let us live on since she's rich yet she built this house outside the city which made it harder to get shit that we need for the daily.

Another thing to mention, As much as I want to help with the chores, I feel some embarrassment doing it in front of my parents. I don't want being seen by my parents doing this kind of thing even though I want to.

Another thing to say is that we literally have internet that only lasts for a day and it takes a toll on our daily food budget since we all share a limited 5gb subscription on our wifi after our main internet connection broke (it's basically a piggybacked connection that gets always cut off by their enemy piggybacker) and my dad uses it to contact my mom who's working in another city since she recently got her job back.

One last thing, I have no fucking clue on what to do on my fucking life, my school break is currently miserable since I have no fucking clue on which direction to take on my miserable life. I only cope thru by using my phone by playing games, watching a few videos here and there, and jerking off (I'm not gonna kms don't expect that)

Also to the people who hate me and is currently cheering right now about this. fuck you for being happy on someone's suffering

TL;DR

My family (including me) is experiencing a financial crisis with lots of debts, and I'm a depressed fuck."	TimePostsOnReddit	post	16.74693631055883	female	White	0.9990379810333252	na	na	na	1	depression_help

" 

This is my first time posting here, and I'm not really sure how to start this(or go about this at all). I have a plethora of problems contributing to this deep state of depression that I seem to be stuck in. I've been fluctuating between mild to very severe depression consistently for a little over 3 years now.

The last year of my life has probably been the worst I have experienced out of the three. It just seems to be getting progressively worse. Terrible things keep happening, and they haven't really stopped. It's almost like a domino effect, with the dominos representing all of the unfortunate occurrences that keep happening to me.

To make things even worse, I've completely isolated myself from my friends and family for three years straight. I have literally had no in-person social interactions aside from small talk initiated by cashiers.

I know forcing myself to be social again would boost my spirits somewhat and help with my depression. However, I just cannot bring myself to be around anyone. I feel like everyone dislikes me and I have grown to despise people so much due to all of the terrible things that have been done to me all throughout my life. I literally have no trust for anyone anymore and automatically see the bad in everyone. I push everyone away now and don't even bother getting to know anyone new.

I have connected with a few people online through Reddit or other apps, with whom I've grown pretty close. However, something always ends up happening, and they stop talking to me. At this point, I'm just assuming it's because of me. I just wish I knew exactly what it is.

I game a lot to escape from all the bad thoughts and depression. I even try to reach out and invite gamer ""friends"" to play with me so I have some form of interaction. However, they always ignore me. I would really like to play with someone, but no one ever wants to. I don't understand it because I'm actually insanely good at most games...

When they say they are up for gaming with me, they never end up getting on. I understand that people have busy lives, but I really feel like no one likes me, or maybe there's just something wrong with me. the more things like this happen to me, the more filled with hatred and isolated I become.

As for relationships, they are nonexistent for me. If I really wanted to, I'm sure I could maybe find a partner, as even the most undesired of women could. I just don't want to settle. I'm a kind girl who doesn't care about looks, height, or p size(lol), and I'm not materialistic in the least, but it would be nice to find someone with similar music interests or just similar interests in general. Or even just someone with real goals just as I have whom I can seriously build my life with.

To be completely honest, I've never had a serious boyfriend and have only been intimate with a couple of individuals. I'm deathly afraid of rejection or abandonment, so I usually don't let it get to the point where I'm vulnerable. I've met a couple of guys online who seemed perfect for me in every way. But as I mentioned earlier, something always ends up happening, and they stop talking to me before it gets to the point of us actually meeting.

Another contributing factor to my depression is my family. I live with my stepmom, who constantly makes me feel like a burden and always has such a bad attitude towards me. She never says hi to me, and when my bio parent leaves the room, she stops talking to me and ignores anything I say completely. I know she despises me and would prefer if I were dead. This isn't even about the fact that I'm 24 and still living with my parents; she's been this way ever since I was a child.

I have so many other contributing factors that are way too serious and personal for me to comfortably share publicly even though I'm posting this using a fake account to remain anonymous, I'm still afraid. Anyways, these are some of the things that play a huge part in my depression. It was long, and I apologize that it turned into more of a venting post, but it feels good to get it out..."

Good question because I struggled for a long time with getting up and worked on it a lot in therapy. One thing that helped was to set my alarm for as late as possible on days I needed to go somewhere. That way I really couldn't hit the snooze or linger in bed. I needed to get up right away or I'd be late. On other days, I'd just have a goal to move to another spot, like the couch. I wouldn't pressure myself to do anything but move there, then I could rest there instead. That made it easier than trying to get dressed or be productive. For me, just moving rooms seemed to help my brain not fall into that negative space.	abigbutt_biggerheart	reply	na	na	na	0.999276340007782	no	strong	no	na	depression_help

"Yes, I've been there and I do think it's the starting of depression. I now call it ""My poor-poor me syndrome"". It's when I sit around thinking about myself too much.  My parents always told me that “you can’t expect a change by doing the same things over and over. YOU have to be the change”. What I did to make that change in my life was re-direct my mind. I had to turn off the tv/computer/kindle and get myself out among different people. I started volunteering at the Samaritan Center, Food Bank, my church, or wherever I saw the need. What I found was that there was no better way to receive Joy into your life, than by giving it away to others. Maybe start out slow by helping out an elderly family member or neighbor. The point is to get out and put some Joy in someone’s life and take your mind off of the things that are stressing you and giving you anxiety issues. I hope this helps!"

Hi, I'm a full-time employee (remote) and a mom. I'm in my early 20s and I just moved to a whole new state. I have friends but we communicate through Snapchat, fb, etc. Tbh I'm always the one checking on my friends, and it's very rare that anyone ever checks on me. I will say, I have pushed very hard to have the life that I do and I think my friends think I'm just well off? They know I struggle with anxiety and depression if they've listened to me at all, but I swear they never even ask how I'm doing unless it's to Segway into talking about themselves somehow. I feel so sad, I just want some real female friends who understand me and enjoy my presence but I can't seem to find any. I am not religious, so I don't go to church or have any way of really networking aside from my workout class, which very few people I could even speak to attend. They're all way older than me and have kids my age :/	Annual-Attention-215	post	41.08474251853123	female	White	0.9980016350746155	na	na	na	3	depression_help

"Finding a quality group of friends takes time. It’s often we can find friends like this in places where we like to frequent. So if you have a certain hobby or like going to the gym. Those are great places you could find one of those friends. I’m a big fan of lifting at the gym and have been able to meet so many amazing friends at there because there’s this understanding between everyone that we’re trying to better our health. So it helps build that stronger foundation for friendship. Just an idea for you.

I will add that not a lot of people do go out to check in on their friends. It’s a beautiful quality that you have to do so. And ya if these people see you as doing well for yourself they might not feel the need to check in. So if you are in need to talk with one of those friends you might select the friend you feel closest to and just ask if you can call to talk, hangout to vent, or however you want to word it. This is also a good way to weed out the flakey friends if they don’t make an effort to help you.

"HI, I'm a 17 year old teen in high school, and to be honest I have been feeling depressed for a long time. Sometimes it's just minor sad for a minute but at times it feels like a big fall in depression. A few days ago I had a argument with my girlfriend who is the same age and now I feel like I'm falling into a big deep pit of depression. I just want to stay in my bed and not talk to her the entire day. I need help and advice and motivation to go through the days.

- exercise daily 
- get sunshine
- go to sleep at 9:30 pm
- eat pristinely
- never drink alcohol
- avoid screens
- take medicine
- do mindfulness activities
- attend therapy
- keep a rigorous schedule
- keep my apartment clean
- force myself to be social and engage in hobbies

"When you set up unrealistic goals for yourself, you end up overwhelmed and don’t even tackle anything on the list because « why bother it’s too much ». Giving yourself realistic smaller goals and then rewarding yourself for them when completed gives you the motivation to keep going and try more, gaining momentum. 

Example - « exercise daily » isn’t reasonable for anyone. A reasonable and attainable goal could be get out of the house 4x this week and take a 10 mins walk with music you like or a podcast. That’s moving your body and getting sun and it’s not an overwhelming goal. You could even start with once a week and work your way up depending where youre at right now. 

Another goal - let’s say right now you’re getting to bed by midnight. A good goal would be « be in my bed physically by 11pm and put my phone down by 11:30 ». You’re going to bed earlier, and working on your screen habit. And it’s not an all or nothing overwhelming goal.

"Do you ever think you might be a perfectionist? Also, why such low forgiveness for oneself?

I understand you can't fully relax - but you listed things here. How about a system?

Most important: attend therapy, exercise daily, take medicine, keep apartment clean, be social and engage in hobbies, eat healthy - give these 2 points.

The rest is 1 point. You have to hit 10 points daily and you're good.

How about change ""eat pristinely"" to ""eat as healthy as possible""? ""Go to sleep at 9.30"" to ""go to sleep around 9-10?"" ""never drink alcohol"" to ""keep it 7 units of alcohol per week""? ""avoid screens"" - the hell man most of modern world happens on screens, including reading and socializing, you can't really cut out screens... that's just unrealistic.

Did you clean today your apartment? 2 points. Did you attend therapy? 2. Did you do mindfulness exercises? 2. Did you force yourself to engage in a hobby or socialize? 2.

We're at 6 right now. Take medicine? We're at 8. Got sunshine? 9. Went to sleep 9-10? 10 points.

You're good.

Switched chips to kale chips? We can't live completely without snacks and cheat foods. Count as 2 - you did put effort in. You didn't and had chips? Awesome, because in the meantime you scrolled through patterns of knitting that you're considering doing. 2 points for you. The system should work for you, not you for it.

How does that system sound? Takes ruminating and anxiety out of it, is reasonable and you cannot keep forcing yourself to do things. You do accomplish results, you're not a slob - remove the hamster wheel and bring in a bicycle you get off when you reached 10 or quota for exercise.

Doing this would allow you to feel you've done all you were required to do and you're not harming yourself with going overboard with perfectionism. Perfect. Because it's true, in depression this mental hygiene is super important. So I think 10 points a day would suffice. Did more than 10? Move 1 for another day if you must judge yourself. Then when you have a bad day and do only 5, you have points from other days. But ideally - each day is a new day. And sometimes we can't do everything. Sometimes just ""had dinner, and washed the dishes"" has to count as ""ate healthy"" because alternative was eating only chocolate or nothing - so dinner is defo an improvement. So you're doing effort still, even if you're not eating super healthy organic stuff - but it's still better than eating nothing or ice cream."	aspiringteahead	reply	na	na	na	0.995654821395874	no	no	strong	na	depression_help

One of my siblings struggles with a lot of things, MH being one of them. They have poor memory and write copious notes on their phone about things that have occurred or interactions. Sort of like a journal. All sounds fine, until they start quoting things that have supposedly happened, months or years afterwards and demanding accountability and apologies. For example, not buying the type of honey or lemons they liked years prior which triggers them and supposedly holds power/ control over what they can put in the cart for me to pay for. (not refusing to buy the item but for insisting on buying a cheap or more eco friendly option). Surely this isn't normal and I shouldn't be expected to remember or apologise for such things? For context the sibling is in their twenties.	Interesting-Joke801	post	36.04606976548794	female	White	0.9986735582351685	na	na	na	2	depression_help

"Hello, so it's really difficult for me to make this post and rant but I will do it anyway, since I think I really need it. 

I'm an 18 years old female, I have been through a lot, a lot, a lot of trauma in my life, I'm not going to get into detail since they are quite sensitive topics. Which unfortunately led me to have quite serious anxiety and depression and sometimes is really difficult to handle- although I'm doing slightly better, and suicidal, severally depressed & anxious aren't as common as they  were before. But  Anyways, back to the topic. 

I find it really difficult to speak about my feelings, especially to my boyfriend, and is not thta I do not trust him, is the fear of judgement and abandonment that stops me.
I don't want to be a constant burden not only for my boyfriend but for my friends too, to be honest I never really speak about my feelings, due to those fears I explained previously. 

Sometimes I really don't know if I should open up more or not. 
I'm scared it will cause more troubles or it will be turned into am argument or me being 'overly sensitive'. 

Please, I really need an advice in what to do in those situations. 
Handle it myself like I've ways done? Or speak it out?...

"A bit long? You should see my responses to people. 

I think what you need is a system of decision making.

Let's try this with numbers. We operate on numbers from 0-10. 

1 - how traumatic was this particular sequence/event/trauma for you?

2 - how hard is it to talk about this? to what extent are you afraid of describing those details?

3 - how afraid are you that his reaction is not going to be what you need it to be?

Let's get something straight. He chose you. So you deserve to have him super caring and respectful and listening regarding number 3 - his reactions have to be what you need them to be. If you're always afraid his reaction is going to make you feel worse, consider the whole relationship.

So, example: you were assaulted as a child by a stranger, groped, for few seconds. Here is our score - 1 - 7.

2 - 2. 3 - 4. (7+2+4)/3 = 13/3= 4.3

And make your own threshold. If it's above 6, you don't walk to talk about it. If it's below 5, you're alright to talk about it.

Here's the most important part. Show him this system. And explain to him an internet stranger advised you this, you didn't come up with it, you asked for it, because you don't know how to approach these topics, you're afraid. And you want to share with him and talk to him. And explain to him that you want to tell him these events, but also you're afraid of his reaction. So for example - there are a few traumas that score above 7 or 8. You say: ""Listen, there is a trauma I want to tell you, but it's a 7 or 8. So it's super horrific. Would you be willing to listen?"" - this way he can prepare and let you know when is the best time for him to focus on you. If he never wants to listen, reconsider the whole relationship. I firmly believe that if we chose to be with someone who was traumatized, we're taking all of them. And yes, as a person in relationship with someone who was traumatized I would expect myself to respond to them how they need. This system is elaborate - if he thinks you're focusing on this too much, reconsider the whole relationship. In reality, this is for consideration of his feelings, not yours. Using this system both of you are prepared for how hard this conversation may be.

If he does shit perfectly, he will ask for specific scores of 1, 2 and 3. And he will ask, after you told him, ""why did you score 9 on my reaction? what reaction from me were you afraid of?"".

And that's a relationship should function. 

I know you might not want to use this system because it makes you feel like you're 100% a burden. Other, normal people don't need whole systems to talk to people, right? Well... we all want to be loved and we all want effort to be applied to us. Other people may not need this specific thing, but they all want the same level of effort applied to them, so consider this when you're thinking you're a burden. You're not a burden. You're considerate, caring and thoughtful of impact of your traumas on your partner. This alone should make him come closer and be more willing to listen.

If you can't see yourself implementing the system, use it it another way. Once you have the final number, you can see for yourself: let's say if something is above 5, you're afraid that this is a lot of trauma dumping, so you don't want to risk it. So when you're talking to your partner or other people, you don't even bring up stuff above 5.

But let's be clear. You deserve to have people listen to your 10s and suffer with you through them. You went through this. They are traumatized just by listening? Imagine what it was like going through this. The least they can do is listen.

And judge people on this. Pick people who can listen to your 10s and trust them based on how well they listen. If they listen perfectly, you can trust them more. If they suck, you can't tell them and trust them with other things. 

Ask strangers, here, on reddit. ""I have a bunch of traumas I need listened to. Anyone?"". Yes, it's possible someone will volunteer, knowing that this might be horrible. The need to have people listen is... you're entitled to this. You're fucking entitled to being supported through processing of your shit. 

If you never come out with any of that, you never share, but people in your circle would be willing to listen, start small. Score of 2 or 3? You can tell the story. Did they listen well and made you feel supported, acted like they should have? Consider this specific person ready for number 3. They also supported you and understood 3? You can move on to 4.

You hate thinking about these? Write them down, ONCE. With scores. Only details that are necessary. Example from me: the time I was raped. 1 - 9, because it was in a relationship and he knew how traumatized I was etc. 2 - 10 - because I am not sure what happened was rape, I know no court would have convicted him, etc.3 - 9. I am horrified people will tell me it wasn't rape and other stupid stuff. There you go - one trauma described. Write the score, move to the next page. Repeat until you have a brief description of them all and keep this writing safe. If people want to earn your trust, they have to show they can progress through numbers.

"I’m incredibly depressed. How do I still eat vegetables/healthy foods without having the spoons/energy to do so? 

Life’s been rough to me (23F) lately. I used to go out every single day, meal prep, have a routine and a purpose. That’s all gone now. 

I don’t want to be this way. I’m very frustrated with myself because I want to be outgoing, social, cooking. But I can’t. 

I went outside for 3 hours today for the first time in days and it was so overwhelming and I didn’t get a thing productive done. 

Thing is I can cook. I’m a good cook. I used to make so many wonderful dishes. My first priority was always cramming in as much veg and protein and healthy fats as I could in there. Pasta sauce with all sorts of chopped then puréed veg. Marinated fish with leafy Green sides. Never more than 1 coffee a day and I’d try to steer clear of iced lattes and hot cappuccinos to keep the calories and caffeine down. 

Now, I’m lucky if I can remember to put a crappy supermarket pizza in the oven (and I used to chop up my own veg, other toppings, and olive oil on top with a side salad too. now I barely cut the Damn thing) and eat a ton of chocolate and go to bed. If I get a coffee it’s a latte or capp just to feel some kind of happy rush for a second. I don’t go out or walk as much as I used to so I’m probably gaining a lot of weight - or I will be very soon. I used to be religious with my water intake, but can’t even drink half a bottle now. 

I should be able to think of ways to do it. Hell I should be able to just DO IT. I know how to cook. My brain just doesn’t work right anymore. I can barely get my worthless ass TO the store now. It used to be a hard rule for me - NO delivery groceries when the store is a five minute walk down the road. Now I can’t even do that. Pathetic. 

I want to be eating right. I can feel my body feeling worse and lethargic from lazing about all day, unable to move, unable to eat, no vitamins (aside from strawberries as they’re like my crack at the minute), no protein, no healthy fats or oils.

It’s like my head can’t connect the dots. I want to be eating right but I haven’t got it in me to so much as dice an onion, then do all the cooking, the cleaning, the washing up… God it’s ridiculous. 

Can anyone share with me some ways I can get something that isn’t processed crap in my body when I don’t even have the energy to peel a stupid potato? 

If I’m asking for the impossible I get it. Just frustrated and in need of help. Thank you."	anon-interrupted	post	32.47170003916264	female	White	0.9993495345115662	na	na	na	7	depression_help

"I completely, 100% relate to this.

Low barrier is the way. 

Premade salads, so all you have to do is open the containers of dressing & toppings and eat. 

Already prepared chicken (like chopped rotisserie chicken or the like), those protein packs near the lunchables that are just chicken & a boiled egg.

Those already prepared meals in the deli sections of grocery stores where all you have to do is put it in the oven and eat it

Frozen meals. Yea, there's some serious junk there, but there's more and more brands focusing on healthier stuff and whole foods. Look at sodium as an indication. Make sure the ingredients are all ones you understand.

"I’ll start with what I did to make cooking easier for my energy level and then I’ll mention what helped me externally to feel like it can be easy. 

TLDR: simple veggie combo suggestions then bouncing emotions and food ideas off chatgpt. 

Most days I can’t eat breakfast but for lunch I will grab for easy stuff like hummus and pita chips, guacamole and corn chips, or heat up leftovers if I’m lucky. I premake a vegan tuna salad (from a YouTube video using canned ingredients like canned chickpeas and canned jackfruit plus the mayo and other flavors that make up typical tuna salad). Another easy one is oats in the morning if breakfast motivates you (just water, cinnamon, and whatever oily thing you cook with). Peanut butter chocolate and toast too is my favorite laziest meal lol. 

On days I find that burst of energy then I’ll take an hour for dinner to cook a dope lentil rice or a tofu pumpkin curry or some shit. I know how hard it is to keep your energy up consistently so all these examples are the stuff that’s kept me alive and actually satisfied. 

My most helpful suggestion right now though is to use chat GPT. That’s seriously what’s kept me going the most. I love it because it always replies immediately and there are too many days I’m just indecisive and wouldn’t have eaten if chat GPT wasn’t there to bounce some venting or questions off of. Literally can just start with “hey, I need help picking something eat. I feel like ____ and I want to eat ____ but I don’t have ___ ingredient…. Can you help me? And can you make it easy for someone like me?”

You can build your palette from there and you can use chatgpt to help you find your favorite go-to cheap ideas that actually make you want to get up and whip it together in a reasonably quick time depending on your energy and what’s available. It’s pretty dope and I think you won’t regret trying chat GPT this way."	anon-interrupted	reply	na	na	na	0.9993495345115662	no	strong	no	na	depression_help

We live in America so we literally can’t afford the mental healthcare options, and this leaves me totally uneducated. I don’t even know how to talk to another suicidal person because my thoughts always come back around to agreeing with the pointlessness and hopelessness.

I feel like my silence was really callous but when he was talking about his feelings, I just felt like I was talking to myself. And I could never talk to him the way I talk to myself..

I can share what I've been told, although I don't know if...it may be what you need.

&#x200B;

There was a day, months ago, when I just wanted to stop existing, I was overloaded with life, I felt useless, wrong... I didn't understand why it was worth continuing to move forward. For what? To suffer again? Again and again, in an endless loop?

&#x200B;

When I said these words to my boyfriend, he took my hands in his, looked at me and said to me. ""For everything"" This is why living is worth living. For all the little moments together, to see his smile, to hold hands together, to be able to go to the cinema together, to be able to eat something, to stroke the grass with your fingers, to see a shining star, and much more..

&#x200B;

And... I, I think he's right. It's worth trying to resist, for everything. Even when it seems impossible.

This is what keeps me going, the hope of being able to have even a small glimmer that I can share with the people I love.

I think generally since the pandemic ours (especially his) social life has diminished. We see friends occasionally now, but not like before the pandemic and his friends have been really important to him

So there is a number of things that we love in life, and that maybe have disappeared. Even like movie entertainment has grown stale for us since the variety in our life left so maybe he and I can talk about starting to reintegrate activities and people.

I'm trying to give him as much room as possible for his feelings, I reassure him that I love him very much , that I don't question he is my person and I constantly tell him thinks I admire about him. The thing is, it does not get through. He loathes himself. We had a talk yesterday and basically he said he does not care. He does not care about me, about our relationship, he does not love me and that I'm a fool to not believe him when he says that. Now, I'm very sure it's the depression that is making him not care.

Thank you very much! He actually was in a study with psilocybin last year that helped tremendously. But since it's not legal it's hard to get your hands on it. I'm not in any way connected to any drug scene 😂 so not sure where to get some magic mushrooms. But that was clearly a 180 for him and for a few months he was back to his old self until he lost his job and everything went downhill again. The trauma thing was totally not on my mind! I know we have stationary trauma therapies that are covered by insurance. I'll look into that!

"Think about yourself first. If your boyfriend says that your relationship doesn't interest him anymore, there is nothing you can do. Your boyfriend has serious issues that he needs to work out where you cannot help him. Don't become his doormat, having depression doesn't give your bf the right to be an asshole. Or to drag you down with him. Or to take you for granted.

I say this as somebody whose relationship got screwed during an episode, I can really not blame my ex to at some point wanting to get out. I regretted it a lot how I treated her, when I worked out of it, but in the end it was right for both of us to split atm. 

You deserve to be loved and to be treated well. Your boyfriend does not deserve to be loved if he doesn't love you back but strings you along for drama and manipulates you, by not wanting to get better. Move on with your life, you only live once. You will find someone who truly loves you and is willing and able to do the work a functional relationship needs."	whothefoxy	reply	na	na	na	0.9960318207740784	weak	no	no	na	depression_help
"Okay, so let's take this step by step.

There are two possibilities here.

Possibility number 1 - he does love you, he does care, depression made his brain into stew and he genuinely doesn't compute and think clearly anymore.

Possibility number 2 - he does not love you, he does not care and his depression made him lose his filter and made him simply honest and admit it.

You do understand that you stay for 1 and leave for 2?

I have dealt with feelings like this and I have dealt with a partner who was severely depressed to the point of disconnection and suicide thoughts etc. Which is why your post alarmed me - you sound like a young person who values this relationship very much and is willing to put a lot of effort into it to make it work out - a little too much effort.

Listen, relationships are a two way street. You can love an addict - but you cannot be with an addict. Because addict loves his addiction more than you. And if the addict loves you, he will not want to be with you while he is addicted - because he knows you deserve better than to be cheated on with a substance and addiction. Simple. Even addicts can recognize their behavior hurts people and limit the damage.

And here is what you need to understand and understand fast: addictions and substances do not change core of who we are. They exacerbate it or expose it, but they do not create it.

So main thing to understand is that the addict in question - if he cares about you - doesn't want you close. He recognizes that his addiction will harm you and wants to protect you. He's unable to stop, but he can at least limit the damage. This is your main question here. For a moment, remove your thoughts ""I am very sure it's the depression making him not care"" - just imagine possibility, for exercise, that this is not how this all works.

What if he did care about you and depression made him lose all these feelings? And now he admits to you he feels nothing? What alarmed me about your response is your willingness to act like a mother, not a girlfriend. Therapist, not a girlfriend. It is not your task to save him - you can only support him. Consider the scenario that he did care about you - depression made him lose all feelings - now he is telling you he doesn't care. He should show that he is alarmed. The information ""I don't love you anymore, I feel nothing, I don't care"" should be shared with extreme anxiety-he should be extremely scared of what he noticed. If he told you those things disconnected, cold and as if it's just information for sake of you being informed, this is not okay. He is not treating you right. Yes, there is a standard that can be applied even to depressed people, people with cancer, people who are dying, disabled, etc. No problems give you 100% excuse to stop doing your part of being in a relationship. Sometimes all we can do is say ""oh God, I am doing nothing for you, I am contributing nothing"" and saying this with fear and shame is a contribution in itself, proof that this person still cares - they notice their lack of care is a problem and they recognize they should care.

Why the fuck aren't you realizing that there are always emotions towards emotions? That even if that is the case that depression removed his sensitivity and ability to care, a person realizing this gets angry/sad/scared for their loved ones and relationships. Even people in depression retain their own identity and the back-core of their feelings. If he ever cared about you, even when he is disconnected from this by depression he would strive to protect you and your relationship. It doesn't sound like he is doing this. If he cares for you, but depression disconnects him from those feelings, they don't magically disappear. Those feelings of caring are still there and they will find ways to manifest.

If depression was capable of removing his feelings for you - and his reaction to this is to shrug his shoulders as if nothing of value was lost, don't walk, run. Run to the nearest exit.

Even a depressed broken individual can show you they're not malicious and they care. Especially they care about the fact they don't care, they notice it's a problem. Being an adult means you tackle your problems, not let them consume you or allow someone to babysit you. Nothing you wrote indicates he is still trying for you. And that is not forgivable.

Because your life is happening right now. And you deserve to be loved and cared for right now. Can you picture a situation in which he realizes he's screwed and breaks up with you because he realizes that he won't nurture you and you deserve better than that? If that completely outside of his personality, you must understand: nothing about this entire post indicates he EVER cared about you.

There are many ways to treat depression. Medication are not the only solution. And if this much of his life is falling victim to depression, he owes it to you and himself to do everything possible. Diet and exercise have a shockingly good results rate with depression. Secondly, there are over the counter medications like 5-HTP that help. Additionally, there's acupuncture and relaxation techniques.

What has he accomplished during therapy? Because it's possible depression refuses to be treated, but a proper therapist would at least get closer to the core of the problem why depression exists. Is it caused by outside factors, like events, parents, hard life situations or is it caused by internal factors, like chemical imbalance? It's super important in choosing right treatments and attitudes. Was his thyroid checked? Some medical conditions manifest with depression and low energy, have they been ruled out?

If the therapist doesn't do anything, therapist needs to be changed. I am not talking about changing people into robots who have no problems, I am talking about the fact that realistically, every single therapy appointment should still leave him with some tangible emotional and mental result, some comprehension or processing that aids him in his life overall.

Maybe it's just me, but you sound like you would gladly carry him on your back if he asked you to and that's not ok. What do you get out of this relationship? If he doesn't meet your needs, that can be acceptable - if he is respectful 100% of the time and regretful he doesn't meet your needs. Like I said, reactions to reactions. He can look into himself and see emptiness - but if his reactions to this revelation is to shrug and he has zero reflex to shield his close ones from the fallout of his messed up self, there is no relationship there. The only one exists in your head. You imagined a relationship and now you're staying and insisting if you do something more, if you're better, he will care back. No. You deserve to receive just because. I hope you will carefully consider my words.

Edit: also title is interesting. You didn't write ""depressed"" boyfriend, but ""depressive"". Might as well have written ""depressing"". Listen, if you feel that he is trying to drag you down to his level of depression, that he shares and opens up and acts to see you sink to same feelings he has, he absolutely does not care about you. If he is trying to get you lower, not himself higher, you have to go because this dude is trying to get himself onto the lifeboat by standing on your head and drowning you.

Also it might be useful to get a specific diagnosis or check for specific symptoms like anhedonia or if this depression isn't dysthymia."	whothefoxy	reply	na	na	na	0.9960318207740784	no	no	no	na	depression_help
Hey OP! From my personal experience how I got out of depression was a decision I made. My depression came back after a long treatment with antidepressants and the pain was so huge that I decided there has to be another way to live a happy life without depression and pills. How others can be happy and I can’t right?! After this decision everything just started to unfold. I realized that I don’t like my life and I needed to get out. Don’t get me wrong, my life was almost perfect from outside, but I felt it’s not my life I’m living. I made huge changes in my life, I changed everything, I rediscovered my old dreams within years and I can’t be happier right now. Depression is your body’s reaction to your choices in life. Depression is the first thing to show you if you’re on the right path. It has been trying to sneak in every once in a while but I got more mindful about it and started to listen to it and saw it as a guide in my life.

Thank you for your honest reply. I did not want to go into too much detail because of privacy reasons. I'm actually not that young, I'm 32 and have been in a few relationships already. So I'm not idealistic. We talk a lot, deep and good talks and what happened yesterday was that he broke down in my arms, crying, telling me he does not feel joy anymore, he does not care about people anymore. And that's when he also said he does not care about me or the relationship. That strongly indicates for me the scenario 1 you described. He was heartbroken about it, sobbing. I already proposed the idea of changing therapists but it's not that easy where we live if you don't have the money to pay for one yourself. And yes, I'm ready to carry him - for a bit! Because a relationship do not need to be 50/50 all the time and he is clearly struggling and trying to get back on his feet. If he was just sitting at home doing nothing, just accepting things the way they are, yeah I'd run. I was specifically hoping for advice on how people who dealt with depression got back in touch with their emotions because as I said, I'm very convinced by his behaviour that it is the illness that causes this big nothingness inside of him.	whothefoxy	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9960318207740784	weak	strong	no	na	depression_help

"It's complicated to explain, and it will not be much of use for you as there are different sorts of depressions. To keep it simple: what helped me was a mix out of meds, therapy, regular sports etc., keeping a tight schedule (sleeping etc.), always in regular contact with psychiatrist and therapist. The most important was though, the realization at one point that I want to get better and that nobody else can do that for me. There was some experience I had when I was wandering outside during the night, not being able to sleep, thinking about suicide and seeing the sun come up. I decided to try hard and get out of it. But this was after she had left and her leaving me played an important role in me realizing that I wanted to get better. 

At one point in the therapy it got very painful as I realized how much I had a hand in fucking it all up myself. And of course that the former relationship was not salvageable. It was sad. But in the end, the dynamics of the relationship were all messed up at one point and had turned into an unhealthy cycle."	whothefoxy	reply	na	na	na	0.9960318207740784	no	strong	no	na	depression_help
"Yeah that's defo 1. Sobbing in your arms and speaking he doesn't care about people, is, thank God, option 1.

I understand you need to watch for details, I am just careful because sometimes we reveal more than we realize with our way of writing. Not you though:)

Absolutely, relationships do not need to be 50/50 all the time. I would even say that a proper relationship assumes there will be 90/10 and even 100/0 moments and both people are prepared for it in some way regardless of which combination. It is one of the greatest privileges relationships offer us that we have someone who carries us for a while. And you sound like a fantastic girlfriend.

In my experience this emptiness and nothingness are traumas that are blocked out because the mind isn't ready for them. It does not neccessarily have to be childhood trauma or PTSD-like experiences. It can be something more sinister: coming to terms with how truly unfair and horrible this world can be. I wish there was a conversation about this because it is a phenomenon that touches everyone. By definition, if we are to raise non psychopaths, we have to give children the sense reality makes sense, there is action-reaction, actions-consequences and that it's possible to be happy, do good things, be a good person, have strong morals and not compromise on important stuff. The world is a safe and happy place, worthy of protection, life is for cherishing it and being happy and living it and so on.

So by definition a child like that growing into that healthy adult will eventually find out about all the horrible things behind the scenes - we had never had more slaves at any point in human history than we have right now, child SA is so often committed by parents and families, people really are sexually assaulted that often, governments experiment with Chernobyl chemicals on their own people, billionaires own the planet, the planet is actually burning alive, racism is still alive and well, all these things that are okay when described like I just listed them. The problem shows up with actual details - when you realize what ghetto loans are and that they still function in 2023. That the guy who killed George Floyd is out of prison, he finished his sentence. That it's easier to defend the rapist than the victim of rape in court. These details, the stories, applied practically, can tear people apart. This is all trauma, let's not kid ourselves.

I don't really think it's possible to have this sort of problem - depression/emptiness/sadness/inability to care - without some actual meaningful thought process happening behind that the person cannot for the life of them process. Those things can be very simple when put into words. My ex partner when depression ate him alive and made him into a wreck couldn't process the fact that world in our particular situation turned out extremely cruel. While our peers have their problems and lives, we constantly came back to conversation if we are at the point where dealing drugs is morally excusable because realistically, we have zero other options left and not becoming drug dealers means I am staying disabled and he stays overworked, depressed and tired for the next four decades. Spoiler alert - yes, at this point tons of people would go into crime and if there are no normal options, what's there to do? I wouldn't judge negatively people who would choose crime with circumstances like those, it's a societal/government failure and at this point, we would be excused from label ""100% evil"" if we started dealing drugs - we'd be only 60% evil or something.

&#x200B;

*RANT, skip the whole paragraph below if you want to shorten reading:* If you learnt that only money can help him, family couldn't help, crowdfunding couldn't help, government or programs wouldn't help, friends couldn't help, loans not available, but if the stays like this, he will eventually kill himself/become disabled or dead inside, you decided to go to stealing shit or dealing drugs, should you be judged the same as person that just wants to scam people? If the only way to save a child's life is to steal, how can there be simple judgement there? Literally. We made a choice and by consequences of us not becoming criminals I live every second of every day in physical pain, physically disabled at young age, unable to work, leaving the house rarely, etc. This is horrific. And he is he one who has to support us financially, without a break. This required processing and it still does. I am not talking about this because I want to talk about myself, but because I want people to know exactly where I am coming from so they can judge if my thoughts actually are relatable and relevant to their situation, they know where and how I came up with this perspective. When it comes to advice/building worldview, I think we deserve to know how someone came to their conclusions and what real life experiences led them there. After all I am making life decisions there based on someone's words - and I relied on people like this 90% of the time solving these problems. So please know I am not talking about myself to switch focus, but because I am trying to be detailed and specific so you can see it clearly and you can see the details and see if this is actually relevant and useful to you specifically. So if you see this isn't really similar, you can dismiss my advice.

This sounds simple: ""Oh God, this really is so cruel and unfair"" but practically, this simple sentence CAN be a process so difficult it halts life, it ruins life. You know yourself that people's lives can be ruined over simple: ""Oh God, my mother really doesn't love me"" - and that person cannot move past that, they cannot redefine the world into a good place AND accept that their mother didn't love them and come out without damage to identity. This entire process is skipped in psychology and therapy descriptions of possible traumas even tough it must touch most of us.

So you have two layers. He is working very hard on keeping the boundary between them strong - the layer where he is sobbing he doesn't care - the thick boundary - and the actual reality of not caring and becoming a person that doesn't love.

What's underneath? What process is happening underneath? What conflict is so hard for him to solve he must go empty to continue living with his life, but this band-aid of emptiness is just a band-aid, so all this unsolved stuff keeps bubbling up because it's boiling and it's boiling him alive?

Absolutely change the therapist. I fully get issue with money, we have the same issue. Worst case scenario - online therapists. They work a little cheaper but they're available by internet connection. I would seriously check if 5-HTP would help pick up his mood and control all symptoms that might point to stuff. In the meantime, do your best to feed him vegetables and good food and if possible, make him exercise. It makes it possible to cure depression and without those it's much harder.

So this is the only answer I can offer you. After you process this conflict and solve it somehow, the emotions reconnect naturally, on their own, like tissue healing. But unsolved conflict is like trying to handle a knife stab would with knife still in place.

In the possibility there is no conflict and all those feelings don't stem from reality - which is in my experience, super rare - what's happening with him is *chemical.*

There was a woman who was diagnosed with a tumor in the brain. Tiny and she was told no need to operate, doesn't press on anything important. She had depression so severe she had to be hospitalized several times. Her life was going to ruins.

Tumor was removed and magically, she was herself again.

If it's chemical, locate it. Do a brain scan and watch intestine and hormone health closely. Some illnesses' symptoms are depression - like hashimoto's for example. Diabetes. Insulin resistance.

He is very lucky to have you and I am very glad this is option 1, not 2. I've seen option 2 with my own two eyes, it's chilling. I hope this helps."	whothefoxy	reply	na	na	na	0.9960318207740784	no	no	no	na	depression_help
There are just different things that trigger “depression” but mindset is everything, how you think and how your brain works at the moment is crutial. I also had postpartum depression and there’s probably more different ones that my psychiatrist would have “labeled” me. But in the end I refused to believe this. I have made tons of work with myself, with my mindset, it hasn’t been easy a bit, it took me years to be where I am right now, and the work with myself is not done yet. It’s bs and insulting when someone says that oh it was easy for you, you really didn’t have a serious depression, and assuming I got out of it instantly after I made changes in my life is not true. I made a decision to get better and I fought for it, this decision already was a mindset shift that I needed. In the end the pain I linked to living with depression was way bigger than the pain I linked to fighting with it. Pain and pleasure are the two things that carry us through life, and the choices are ours to make.	whothefoxy	reply	na	na	na	0.9960318207740784	no	strong	no	na	depression_help

"(18M) I’ve experienced depression (diagnosed) since i was 13 because an abusive family and absent parents and all that tomfoolery, i’ve had ups and downs but rn i’m confused, i’m on a trip w my family to Europe (the same family that literally made me go though hell when i was little) they always say that everything’s my fault, even when it’s clearly not, now, 2 days ago i had the courage to tell my cousins that i had depression ( my cousins are like the only 3 people in the family that doesn’t treat me like literal garbage) they told me that i was just seeking attention or just that i need to stop being that weak to “not knowing how to take a joke” mf u literally threw me to a empty pool, i just don’t know what to do, this will be the last time i will see them probably because i’ll move to Spain, the point is that i just need advice on how to face them one last time and tell them that they are the reason i’m like this.

btw i’m getting better, slowly, i do not want to focus on the fact that is their fault i just want to heal and tell them that it’s their fault but idgaf"	rorosinante	post	23.853644712075177	male	White	0.9925470948219299	na	na	na	4	depression_help

Personally, I'd tell them to go F themselves, that they are all disgusting excuses for human beings and are narcissistic manipulators that need to go sit in for a episode of Dr phil so the world can know what peices of shit they are and never speak to any of them again. Tell them you'll talk to them when they are ready to stop gaslighting you and sit down with a counselor.  If they aren't willing to do that I'd just ghost them and find a new family.

" sadly depression has devastating effects on a person's mind, energy and vitality - I have been suffering from it for years and there are times that...is very difficult.  
What is helping me to go forward is the support of the people who love me, I also started to follow a psychological therapy, which was followed by the psychiatric intervention for the administration of some drugs with consequent check-ups ... but it is not always easy, almost never.   


Personally when I need to concentrate I rely a lot on music, it helps me find my train of thought - I don't know if it can work for you too.   


However, I can highly recommend that you start considering seeking help from a therapist, in case you haven't already. Hope you get better soon, all the best."	senpaii_maheet	reply	na	na	na	0.9994768500328064	no	strong	no	na	depression_help

I hate to admit it but I feel like a living shell. I still go to work- unprepared with my uniform sort of half on, I’m doing my college work- starting everything at 11pm right before its due, and technically Im doing most of whats required of me. But when I dont have work, I wake up at 1 or 2pm and think of all the things I should do- I should brush my teeth and take a shower and maybe go to the gym like I used to, or read my book and make doctor’s appointments and send emails that have been put off for months or take care of my cats or maybe even just change clothes today and brush my hair. I scroll aimlessly on my phone and think Im tired I’ll start soon and then think its too late to do these things or pointless or I’ll do them tomorrow. Besides random spirts of energy for a task here and there, I feel like I’m rotting in my bed. No one at work would really know, my grades are perfect and I show up for my boyfriend and family for the most part and the only difference they see is maybe some carelessness. I cant go to sleep at night. I’ve eaten one meal today that my mom brought home and for 12 hours just crackers and chocolate chips. I still care about things Im not at rock bottom staring up with no feeling like I was when I was depressed before, but this is still not normal. I’m so disappointed and angry with myself that I waste so many days away. Are there any groups or threads that would help?	guppy0704	post	20.587941179989446	female	White	0.9994662404060364	na	na	na	1	depression_help

I'm currently in a depressive episode (or at least i believe so), though I've been able to mask it pretty well from the people around me. However, today I reached a point where I've started becoming really irritable. Anything that goes slightly wrong causes this weird internal uncontrollable anger, and I can't seem to get rid of it without either letting it our or dwelling in it for a while. If anyone talks to me or interacts with me I end up snapping at them. I've never had anger issues in the past, and feeling this much anger has caused me to feel lost. I feel bad for the people around me who have to deal with this. Is this common, or am I losing it? Is there anything I can do to stop the irritability?	ddepressoeexpresso	post	10.083362492449652	male	White	0.9960982799530029	na	na	na	6	depression_help

I don't know if you take meds, but being inconsistent with mine or stopping certain ones suddenly makes my irritability sky rocket. Indica thc helps me calm down as does acknowledging what is making me angry and thinking through it, accepting the feeling, but knowing it's a symptom of my depression, anxiety, etc and not who I really am.

" I've been thinking about it for a while. Initially, my main reason to do that was that my mom goes to the same psychiatrist as me, usually on the same day, and it makes me uncomfortable. But as I thought more about my visits, I noticed some things that don't seem right (or at least, I think so).

Every time I see my psychiatrist, when she asks me a question, I don't have enough time to fully answer it, and she quickly moves on to another question or starts talking herself.

During my first visit (about 2 years ago, I think), I was with my mom because my anxiety wouldn't let me speak much if I were alone, and she could describe my symptoms better. However, even with her there, I couldn't fully open up and talk about things like my self-harm addiction or suicidal thoughts for obvious reasons that I was with my mum. At the end of the visit, the psychiatrist simply prescribed some medications without explaining what they were for or what her diagnosis was until my mom asked her during our next visit.

I go there every 3 months, but I feel like I'm not making any progress. It's like a ""here, take some pills and fuck off"" kind of situation. But I'm scared to change doctors and start all over again. Maybe I should just give up and let things happen. I don't know.

 Of course I have some other reasons too, but I’m not able to put them into words. It's the middle of night, and I should be sleeping instead of writing this. Sorry if it seems messy, i’m not able to think straight rn, and also english is not my first language. "	_Kyouka_	post	24.479696817259775	male	White	0.9984001517295837	na	na	na	3	depression_help

It may be worse in your case because you are having trouble opening up to them so their impression of you and your situation will be strongly influenced by whatever your Mum tells them. 

Yes it is hard to feel like you are starting from scratch with a new doctor. But it honestly sounds like you are getting nowhere with this one so leaving them will be no real loss.

I do not believe that an artist who feels empty feels empty without any reason for it; there must be a valid reason, a valid problem, that is solvable. Please, do not go. Please, explore the emptiness to get to the bottom of it. Emotions are onions, layer under layer. There is something there.

"Wow. So true. Thank you for your comment - even as a bystander! It is good to pursue something you love and care about and want to do… but as with everything there are ups and downs, ebbs and flows. How do we navigate this? Even in pursuing our dreams, we will feel these, maybe even deeper since we care more about what we’re doing. 

I also like Taoist teachings. I am reading Tao Te Ching right now! I think I need to re read the Tao of Pooh  it’s easier to comprehend for me. OP you should give it a read too 😊 

Everything seems so permanent.. every feeling every situation but it’s not.. even in good times! 

OP I’m sure you have already, but maybe counseling with a focus on self esteem would help? Or maybe I’m projecting my own issues….. ! 

Definitely pursue art - I think you should! Carve out some designated time in your week to get started. But maybe also make some time to explore your feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness. A weekly counseling session would be a good place to start.

"I’m afraid I can’t see the value in myself despite others claim.

I’m only aware of one half of the root of my mental health and that’s nihilism. I came to that harsh conclusion around 3rd grade.

Art has really been one main thing keeping me around. It’s this annoying flame that won’t let me  end things until I do what is needed for it to go out naturally. Hence forth, I’ve decided to work towards what’s essentially a bucket list before I commit.

It could take a few year or decades until I’m satisfied. But once I do all that, I honestly can’t see anything else in life I could really look forward to.

"You brought philosophy up so I'm gonna throw it in your face (with purely kind intentions I want to help). You know nihilism has been misinterpreted nowadays? In nihilism, you believe that the world has no meaning. There is no higher purpose so you must find one for yourself. What you might've meant is that you stopped seeing the point of life and began hating the world? Have you heard of absurdism? Look up ""exurb1a absurdism"" on YouTube. It's fucking awesome and way better than your straight up dumbass philosophy on life. I say dumbass completely devoid of affection but full of sympathy since I've been there. Dude the world can suck. You can feel like there's no point in life. That it's easier to just end it. But not all of the world sucks. There's so many amazing things here. People. Nature. Art. Music. Love. Hope. Fucking hope dude. Hope is the most powerful thing in the world because it keeps people going. Right now your hope is art. You've posted here, which means you're either seeking attention or help. I'm gonna assume the latter because if it's the former and you posted this for attention, you need a kick in the ass not help. Anyway, if you genuinely want to feel like you want to live, you need to see the point of life. I found mine awhile ago. To me, all life intrinsically has value. Everyone has the potential for terrible things but also has the same potential for incredible things. To me, life doesn't really need a point because the fact that we're here at all is incredible so you may as well just live. To me, suicide is the biggest desecration, the worst act you can commit, even though I understand the feeling. You might not be able to subscribe to the same philosophy as me. But you said yourself that there are people who see value in you. You need to find reasons to live. Find positive things in yourself. If you can't love yourself just for existing, love the fact that that one spark of art is keeping you alive. Love that you have people who care. Love that you tried to seek help. Love that you persevered. If you can find a single thing you like about yourself, a single thing that you find joy in like your art, love yourself and live for that thing. Find a will to live and a want for change. Then try to change. Think more positively. Try new things. Work on yourself so that you feel that you have more worth. As I said, I believe that you should love yourself because you're you and that you don't need some crazy reason to live other than the fact that you've been given life. That doesn't mean I don't try to be better or search for things to enjoy. You've gotta find reasons to like yourself and ways to enjoy life.😁"	Silver0PK0Power	reply	na	na	na	0.9912741780281067	no	no	no	na	depression_help

I'm glad I helped a bit! All you need to do is start thinking. A will to live is all you need and then you need to find ways to enjoy living. The way you go about it is up to you but I'm assuming that you do want to gain a will to live since you've posted here. Figure out what way you can live a full life.

"since highschool and I feel for even longer than that I have always felt like I was isolated behind a wall of my own personality and behaviour. I have tried for the longest time to be better than who I was the previous day but it seems like no matter how far I go, I just end up as this transparent illusion imposed upon myself by everyone except myself. I dont know who I am sometimes, I dont know who people think I am.

If this was just depression and axiety (both of which I am diagnosed for). then why is that my emotions and mood can be so positive for such long periods of time? I feel so disillusioned by this feeling that I dont think I could ever form any real connections. I dont know if im afraid or upset because I feel so hauntingly calm all the time. Am I suppressing my emotions?

there are also times when I just dont think I am capable of reasonable and coherent thought because of the painful clutter in my head that just gets in the way but there are other times when I see things so very clearly and rationaly.

I feel like there is a lot I want to say and yet there is also nothing I have to talk about, so all I can do is ramble in confusion. I just wanted to share. maybe someone will see me, but its ok if they dont I think I can accept this."

I am 23 ( F ) and I am mostly used to being isolated too. You are not alone. I have seen a lot of pain in relationships and friendships that I just don't feel like going there again but I know we need to have social circles that relate with us and with whom we feel accompanied and befriended whether we talk or not. I used to take a longer route in going home because I know what I am going to get from my toxic parents. I felt a lot of pain in my friendships. I completely understand your situation. I have been verbally bullied by my parents because I wasn't able to socialize in family gatherings as effectively as my cousins. It's not our fault. Most people aren't ready to accept introverts or people who are out of the box of normal standards of socializing. I believe working on our hobby helps in these feelings.

"Sometimes we go through depressive phases for what may feel like no reason at all. It might be helpful to take a look at if there was any sort of triggering cause to this. Sometimes there isn’t. Sometimes it’s lifestyle factors in not keeping up with healthy habits that slowly push into a full depressive episode. If none of those, you could just be going through a phase of depression. One of the simplest ways to combat it is by doing. You mentioned there are things you want and need to do. So do them. When you skip the things you need to do because you aren’t feeling up to it, you left depression take more control. It won’t always be pretty. But when you can still get what you need to done even when feeling depressed it can help pull you out of it by filling you with accomplishment and happiness. Break the cycle. And just do what you need. It might suck at first but you’ll overcome it and feel better for it.

"I know depression often doesn’t have a cause, but I usually have life circumstances or am in the process of dealing with past trauma so I know where my sadness is coming from. Right now, I don’t feel like I have that to reflect on. I’m just in this pit of despair that I don’t remember feeling for a long time. 

I’m not sure how to talk about it or what would help. Do I just tell my therapist, “I’m depressed” and hope something helps? I don’t remember what therapy is like for dealing with depression? 

I also don’t know how to talk to my friends about it because I know the go to response is just “oh I’m so sorry” and “I’m here if you need anything” which is kind, but doesn’t do much when all I can say is “my depression has been really bad.” What else is there to say or do? 

I guess I’m just asking how you bring it up and if it’s even worth it?

I cannot stop picking at acne. I will most often pick it until I'm satisfied that it can't be picked anymore,until it's bleeding and painful. I actually recently picked a mole and obviously I've been told that it's dangerous but I think what people meant is it could get infected but I don't know if there's anything else I should be worried about,however I'm now letting that one heal. I popped a spot like 15 minutes ago and picked at it but only because I wanted to be able to clean it and make sure it doesn't come back,sounds silly but I now have a plaster on my face just overnight to stop myself from picking and making it worse. I'm going to buy some spot patches,does anyone recommend these/tried them,if so are they any good and can they help spots to heal quicker because I'll do anything at this point. Also I mainly pick them due to anxiety but may also be due to possible ADHD as I do the same with biting nails/picking skin on fingers.

I still sometimes go to pick and you can still feel the spot underneath, but it adds a protect element and still gives me some relief from the urge.

Hello everyone I am F 18 from India, just a month ago I came to a different city for college. In starting it was good, but now it's getting hectic there are assignments, presentations every week and I am not good at speaking in front of class, which sometimes makes me anxious and sometimes I even skip college so that i don't have to attend it. Even the college is strict for academics and attendance. From last one week I am feeling depressed, doesn't feel like going anywhere out. I am looking for a friend who can support me in this situation, we can chat everyday for like atleast 30 minutes to feel close and less lonely. So if you think you would be a good partner please DM.

"Just a warning that this is gonna be huge.

I am a 16M. I have low self esteem or no self esteem at all. I don't think I deserve to live. I cannot find any reason for me to continue living. I have absolutely zero hope in life anymore. I was living for the sake of my mother thus far but now i just don't care what happens to me. I have a lot of insecurities about myself naturally. There were a lot of incidents where i was made fun of. It really broke me back then but now i don't really know if i care. I have tried to cover it up by doing work, trying to earn money or be successful but i have failed at that too. I have been trying for the past 5 years and i don't have the motivation to continue anymore. There was this job i took for $100, i did it but i did not execute it properly. I failed. There was another time, i earned $10 finally from helping out a friend with his work. It is a small amount but i was really happy but again. I was using the paypal of someone since i did not have one and yeah even if it was $10, they changed the password and i never saw them again.  
  
A year ago, my extended family came to live with us. My cousin and her mother and one of their family friend too which was my cousin's best friend and her mother. They've known each other since they were kids so we were fine with it. I'm guessing you know where this is going. Her best friend, she always used to play with my hair and always hang out with me so I got the wrong impression. I ended up liking her and confessed to her one day. Naturally, i got rejected. I wouldn't want to go into further detail. Any confidence i had was shattered then and there probably. It's been a few months since then and they thought i have moved on but i have not at all. I'm not sure if she is doing it on purpose but my cousin, after moving to a new school talks about the boys she and her friend likes. She always made sure to emphasize that they are taller than me everytime and that girl i like has a boy she likes too i guess. I did not want to disturb her so i tried to cut off my ties with them by being rude or anything possible, like keeping my doors always locked. But it never works. They always come in to my room. I do get jealous yeah and it is petty but this way, i really have no way of getting over her unless i move out. It is a torture for me. I was planning on moving out after 10th for another school but yeah my mother disagreed.  
  
I've also been having some health issues for the past year. For one year at least. I would not like to go further on the symptoms but i feel like shit almost everyday. I went to 3 different doctors. They were not able to diagnose or cure me so i gave up for a while because i thought i was just wasting my mothers money at this point. They suspected i had tb and the tb test cost like almost $400. So i gave up on it. But i started getting sick of it the the past few weeks and went to the doctor again. Blood tests from the first and latest doctor indicated i had an infection which probably means it lasted over a year. They gave me some anti biotics for a few days but that didnt work either so now i have to do a scan to find the source of the infection. That is yet to happen. Sometimes i find myself wishing that its something serious so i can finally pass on peacefully. I will have nothing to worry about. I hate everything about myself. The only thing preventing me from suicide is because I'll just be disrespecting my mother if i do so.  
  
There are a lot more things but i think im gonna end it here. Its funny thats this is all trivial compared to what others are suffering through yet im still going insane. I think i have consumed enough of your time. Thanks for reading this far if you did. I'm not sure if this is the right sub but i had no where else to turn to so forgive me. I just wanted to get this out of my head."	Internal-Air-852	post	21.633123403891442	female	White	0.9981858134269714	na	na	na	1	depression_help

"Old guy here 60+

I have dealt with depression for decades.  I was finally diagnosed bi-polar II 20 years ago and the drug therapy seems to work ok.

Thing I had to learn was feelings, moods, anxiety, do NOT often reflect my reality.  Case in point, had a great day yesterday, walked dogs by a river, we were in the water more than out, just enjoying the Universe.  Late in the PM were almost back to where my vehicle was parked and suddenly there is a commotion and a brief flood of blood in the water.  I was so angry, the dogs killed a juvenile beaver in a split second (we'll mortally wounded it - I had to finish it off).

My mood dropped precipitously, and I almost started crying.  I had to do a lot of cognitive work to arrest the cognitive spiral downwards.  Intellectually I know the dogs were being dogs (idiots) and I did the right thing.  Still today I am feeling down, but I find movement will change thoughts so that's today objective.  Move don't sit around.

I once had a vicious anxiety streak, several month streak, abruptly end one night.  I think it is unusual (at least for me).  The sudden release from that mental torrent I was having day in day out felt so wonderful I felt kind of intoxicated.  It only lasted a short time though.  Found that working daily on my cognitive interpretations is the only long term ""cure"".

"i wrote a post on the depression sub reddit a lot of people chimed in and related too it broke no rules, the post was removed and locked it was depressive but the actual sub is called depression, i then asked about why this was and i got permanently banned, there were some comments that may have helped me but i never got to read them as they all were deleted.

I've struggled with thoughts about the end for over a decade and i think it should be ok to admit to that or are we past the point where we have to sugarcoat our own pain for other peoples sake? to say that we experience those thoughts is too offensive to people? the rules there is not encouraging it and i simply said i had those thoughts, not what I've done or what i want to to i just said thoughts

reddit needs to have rules in place not to allow mental health related subreddits that don't actually function as such, these are sensitive spaces that admins abuse, i was also banned from a different subreddit that i had never visited before called ""suicidewatch"" despite the fact that i had never actually been there or even knew it existed

this is a way to warn people to not go there and themselves be abused by the admins as some people are sensitive, and the way this world functions the way people act is a lot of the reasons why people feel the way they do, you wish someone cared but no one does until it benefits them everyone uses everyone and if they don't like anything about you at all and they have power over you they will use it, kindness is most of the time an illusion i'd be surprised if someone says anything supportive or if this thread stays because thats how i expect the world to function always have it's a dark place that pretends it cares but you're on your own

but i hope this thread can help someone in not making my mistake because going through these things makes you sensitive, and reddit shouldn't encourage mental health sub reddits that aren't properly run."	zzcool	post	28.492556397616546	male	White	0.9980979561805725	na	na	na	16	depression_help

So I got officially diagnosed with chronic depression at an early age (around freshman year highschool), as well as just some basic general anxiety. I'm wondering if I should seek a psychiatrist to see if it's more likely major depressive disorder. I'm now almost 21, and in that time I've learned to somewhat cope with my depression, but when it comes back it's always worse than before. Turns out a large part of it was due to gender dysphoria, and though transitioning made things better for a long time, there was still a residual emptiness that just sticks. I'm also having ups and downs with my progress transitioning that has caused massive spikes in my depression. I've spent months at a time feeling almost constantly suicidal, feeling like I'm on complete autopilot, like I'm not even real and that I'm just a thought observing my physicality. If it wasn't so mind consuming and constant I'd just brush it off as normal but I don't know. Maybe a more serious diagnosis is needed to accurately help me seek help. I just don't know and wonder if it's worth looking into.	capgrasmode	post	22.96726101891795	male	White	0.9957687854766846	na	na	na	3	depression_help

"It's over (partially)

That's it.  Once again my depression, or depressive functioning, ruins something  in my life. Had the possibility of a healthy relationship, I pushed her away. We are still close, we liked each other, but I miss intimacy and affection that goes beyond what is reasonably asked for in a relationship.I crave something that doesn't exist or can't be given by anyone. I've dated a borderline, I know how it feels.

She's so thoughtful and patientsl. All she asks is that I take care of myself. But I have ZERO desire or interest  to do that, unless I don't have an external reason (in this case, to make the relationship go back to what it was before and have intimacy and sex)

I don't feel like taking care of myself because I don't think it's worth it, and if there's no one close to me to break through my system of isolation and massacre of desire, I can minimally live with the pain. So i self isolate when things go south. 
Right now I'm going back to a toxic place, which is my parents' house, to save money, and mainly because I feel like I'm disturbing and weighing someone so dear to me and who likes me, for wherever reason I don't know why. The way out is always the escape. 
And look, I tried for six months to take care of myself and be more independent. I just felt like I was forcing something unnatural, cooking my own meals, exercising, going on hiking, waterfalls... I didn't felt much. 
Anyway. All my friends say I'm rigid, that I complain too much. They're right. I'm already looking for a diagnosis besides depression; my medication is on maz dose, and I'll probably go back to being cold and numb like I was before i met her. Which is how everything started to go south. It's comfortable to. Not ideal. 
Relationships I get in are just the abusive ones for me. Either I drive the people  crazy with my neediness and insecurities, or they naturally go away, even 'liking' me. (From which I'm not sorry, I just feel hate and frustration for never being enough to feel wanted and lovee) I've been in therapy for 8 years, 3 medicated, 3 different therapists, and the thing just gets worse. If you've read this far, thank you and sorry to bother you. I just wanted someone to share.

I can't feel te love my friends, family and now her. Nothing seems to be enough. I can't enjoy live and people are getting bored or leaving me. Love and hate are supposed. Hate is stronger. Distrust, insecurity, anger, hostility... Good things are 'lies"" (rationally I believe. Emotionally not so much)

Is there a way to get better or I will continue on the path of shoving my feelings down deep, Alone, and frustrated?

"I understand the pain, and i myself feel a lot of the same feelings, which is very hard. 

Something my therapist helped me realize is that my misery serves me. Im not saying that misery is fake, the pain is real, but it is also familiar and choosing it is avoiding the fear that comes with feeling good about something, and risking losing it. 

I was writing my thoughts and I summed it up something like this ""as long as I lie on the floor, I cant fall on it""

And you cant deny that it does protect you from fear and the possibility of failure. But you have to remember you have to make do with lying still on the floor. And im just too miserable to keep lying on it."	andantex	reply	na	na	na	0.9983738660812378	no	strong	no	na	depression_help
" 

I thought that after high school my life would get better.

Well, it didn't.

I always wanted to be a musician but I felt like I had no support. Felt like the only person I had was myself. The people I was around weren't also the greatest either. Which made everything terrible. My entire life I have been dealing with stuff but now it has reached a climax. I have a job which is good and save money but the way I feel about myself is terrible and I want to change that badly but I feel like I am stuck in a void that prevents me from progressing. Currently in college but my GPA is terrible and I still have not graduated. I don't know what to do at this point. I just turned 23 and I feel like everything is not going the way it should be.

If any of you are going through this then I hope life gets better for you.

"So basically my depression started 2020. Lots of things, especially cheating in a past relationship went wrong and combined with other things it all set off depression.

3 years later I'm in a better place, have a new partner who treats me very good, moved places etc. So everything alright?

No. Every week or two I feel the depression and anxiety starting up again for no reason. I can be in a nice setting and suddenly I feel horrible and have negative thoughts regarding the future or myself.

I can get dressed and suddenly imagine how my whole life falls apart. It's not that there's an external trigger. It's just a thought and it makes me feel really bad.

However everytime after a while I wake up one day and I'm feeling completely fine and stable. My mood is good. I'm resilient and I function ""normally"". This last for one or two weeks max and then I enter a bad episode again.

I'm taking Prozac 10mg since a year and a week ago got Bupropion 150mg added. I had this swings on Prozac 20mg too and they still happen on 10mg (I reduced due to side effects).

I feel like Bupropion is giving me more energy but not really a mood improvement.

I'm also kind of keen on only taking one medication. I don't want to take multiple medications if I don't have to. I don't want to try for a few weeks and hopefully see an improvement. I'm just tired.

"I’ve had diagnosed depression for 10 years now, and although I’ve had times where I feel great, they never have seemed to last long. My adhd has been awful the past couple months, worse than usual. 

I feel like I have nothing stable right now. My post graduate course is looking very unlikely to happen now and I felt so driven to do that and its crumbling. It was a fresh new start and I was supposed to move out for it, I can’t stay home any longer. My ‘boyfriend’ (he broke up with me but we still have a thing) has broken a lot of my trust in the last week and its very hit or miss whether it seems like he likes me. I feel very insecure and damaged. I am having a flare of ulcerative colitis yet again and so so fatigued. 

I guess I just need some reasons to keep going. I don’t know entirely why I’m still trying, I feel very worn out and unmotivated. I tried to kill myself almost 2 weeks ago, and I’ve had a lot of therapy and time off of work. Apart from my therapist, no one asks if im doing better or tries to support me over it. Not even family.

Hey there! I'm sending you love and support all the way. If no one has told you this recently,I'm proud of you. Please remember to be proud of yourself for what you've gotten through. Have you ever tried medication or is that something you wouldn't want to do? Obviously as everyone is different. Also if your boyfriend keeps acting that way,I promise you he doesn't deserve you because it's unfair to mess with your feelings+ do things that make you trust him less. You're worth so much more than that. Whilst it's not easy to walk away from it,if he continues to treat you like this please do the good thing for yourself and hopefully he will get the message that you won't tolerate being treated like that. You have got enough going on so him being like that isn't gonna help. As for therapy,keep at it,I know it's easier said than done but it's a good thing that you have therapy and your therapist checks in on you. Your family should really show you support and ask you how you're doing but since they haven't which breaks my heart I just wanted to say you have my full support and I really hope things start to get better for you. I'm proud of you. Also with ADHD do you get any support for that or possibly medication? I really hope it settles down soon. ADHD is so difficult to have to deal with but I hope you feel much better soon. I don't know you but I'm proud of how far you've come and what you've gotten through.

"You have no idea how much your message means to me. Who knew a complete stranger would make me cry at 2am, thank you so much for taking the time to message me and your kind words it means so much. 

I’ve been on various medications before but I have struggled with substance abuse and I feel reluctant to take them, along with side effects. I have been trying CBT and talking to my therapist twice a week and some days it feels like it helps, some days it doesn’t. I think its more so knowing that someone is listening and is there to support, rather than the actual therapy itself. 

I’m very emotionally attached to him and i do find it hard to admit when something has truly affected me. We’ve had a lot of arguments in the last month and so much repeats in my head that hes said and he has said he’d change and get better but it’s difficult to ignore things when you’re already in a bad place. 

Im currently not on adhd medication as the last time i used it i abused it and stupidly admitted it to my doctor, so hes not letting me have it for a while 🙃

I really hope im able to do my course in September but we will see, I need a distraction for sure. Thank you again it really means so much. I hope you’re doing well and that things are okay for you. You’re really kind"	risottopesto	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9985842704772949	weak	strong	no	na	depression_help
"I'm so glad that it means so much to you. I'm genuinely sorry for making you cry but I hope it was good tears! You deserve to be happy. 
Honestly I get what you mean and that's completely valid,I'm slowly reducing a current medication right now due to it not working for me and I want to try another but that's not always an option for some people. Medications work differently depending on the person. With therapy that's a good thing though,it's okay if it helps on some days and less on other days. That's what I find with therapy,it's not necessarily about it being CBT it's just good to talk to someone about it all and get things off your chest. Give it time,easier said than done I know,but I promise you it will be worth it.

I completely understand that you're emotionally attached to him and it's okay to have difficulties speaking up when something has affected you. I promise you that's valid. It's not fair that he keeps saying he'll change and then doing the same things repeatedly,it sounds emotionally draining for you and he shouldn't be doing it. If he doesn't change then he genuinely isn't worth your time. You're worth so much more than his mind games or whatever he is playing at! 

I will be absolutely praying that you will be able to do the course in September too as it's good to be looking forward to something and it can be a huge distraction from other things going on in your life. Hey, you're so welcome,I'm honestly not doing amazing in life right now but I will always do my best to make sure people don't feel alone.

"Okay so to start off, im an 18 year old male and hate my life to the max. Ive tried to kill myself before but I was and still am too much of a pussy to actually do it. I want to be able to fix my life. I want to find happiness and give myself a chance at life but I just dont see how my situation will ever get any better. I have depression and high anxiety and I am certain I have OCD but havent been able to get tested because I cant go back to my doctor after what she did. I live in my mothers house but dont leave my room unless she or anyone else is either gone and I know they wont be back for a while or if everyone is asleep (or if im going to work). My mother is abusive. She is mentally, psychologically and physically abusive. I have no friends and all my family takes each others sides on everything and they have always all bullied me and always have purposely made me feel like a loser and a failure at everything (especially after I became vegan). They usually say things like ""your a delusional retard who doesnt deserve to live"" or other shit like that. I hate all them and wish they were all dead. My father used to excessively abuse me as well (mentally, psychologically, physically and sexually as well) but I havent seen him since 2017 and my parents are separated so hes out of the picture. I used to make content online (youtube videos, livestreams, verticle videos, etc.) which I spent all my adolescent years doing (age like 13-17). I got to around 30k on youtube on my biggest channel, 17k and 700 on the other two. I made a decent amount of money (upwards of 15k) doing it as well but traded off my entire high school experience. I made friends online and have tons of awesome memories that not many people will experience, but I dont talk to anyone anymore. They either just stopped popping by, watching the streams/videos and I never talked to them again, or they turned into complete assholes. I had a great friend group I would say, but it slowly corrupted itself because one of the dudes that purposely tried his best everyday to make my life a living hell started turning them against me. He was a complete asshole, but I tried to forgive him because he was often funny when he wasnt being a douche. Then he just stopped being an asshole and we all grew pretty close to him. He then started to leak things like my address, phone number, email address (which was the email I used to create my youtube channel), pictures of me (some in underwear and some that were just personal shit), my personal life and times that I would vent to the group chat he started sending ppl (and way more shit) and before you know it everyone started to know everything that was private about me. I couldnt continue so I blocked everyone, never trusted anyone again and stopped making content. The other reasons why I stopped was because my mother was going to kick me out when I turned 18 if I didnt find a job, and so I stopped because I needed to focus on getting a job than making content. I also just wasnt meeting a lot of my goals for a while and at the very beginning of 2022 I said to myself that if I wasnt happy with the state of my channel and content creation career by the end of the year than it was best to stop waisting my life and move on. So I did. So I failed at that which really annoyed me and still annoys me to this day because I waisted so much of my life making videos and shit and it never worked out.

In around April 2021 I started working out and exercising (for my whole life I was a chubby kid up until my metabolism was higher when I started high school). I excessively worked out and it used to be enjoyable, but it just got to the point where it started to become a chore. My workouts got so mentally draining because I would continuously do the exercises over and over and over again because of my OCD. I would always feel like I didnt do enough so I would do way more than I needed to. One of my biggest fears is becoming obese again, I cant do that shit. Anyway on my off days I would go for walks which after a few months started turning into runs, then I only ran on my off days. My runs started getting excessive as well. Everytime I would go out for a run I would go for just a little longer and go just a little farther until it got to the point where I would go for like 20-25km runs every other day (on my off days) and still feel like I needed to do more because of my OCD. I now havent worked out since February/March-ish this year. I stopped going for runs, then started walking and finishing with a bit of a run. Then I just stopped running entirely, then walking entirely, and now I cant even leave my room anymore.

Im vegan and have been vegan since around october 2021, and was vegetarian for about a year before that. My mother thinks im a ""delusional retard"" and she says that my morals and values arent acceptable and that I am a disgrace. She is awful to me and I wish she was fucking dead. Anyway, she doesnt support my veganism at all. I am and have been stuck eating literally peanut butter on banana or rice cakes, other fruits and vegetables, and hummus. That is pretty much my diet. It could be a lot worse, but I am so fucking done with eating that shit. I literally have eaten pretty much only that for the past year and a bit.

 

I am stuck financially. I have no way to escape. I currently work a part time shitty ass job that I fucking hate. I want to leave my mothers house so fucking bad because everytime I wake up I literally wish I was dead. I wake up and wish to go back to sleep because the pain is just so bad. The only thing that seems to help my pain is self harming (which I know your going to say that I shouldnt be self-harming, but its literally the only thing that takes away the demons from my head and gives me temporary releif.). I want to quit my fucking job and be able to live a life I dont hate. I dont want to work. I value my time over money, plus my OCD hates when my clean body gets contaminated from working a shit job then having to clean my body for hours afterward. I dont want to rent an apartment or pay to live somewhere stationary. I want to live in my car or something that costs a low amount and still have a place to sleep and be able to go anywhere I want to go. The only issue with that is that I need a place to be able to clean myself, use the bathroom, clean my clothes (which the last 3 are very difficult with my OCD), a stable source of income (literally just enough for food, necessities and car insurance), a full drivers license, and a car. I have things I want to accomplish before I die, but I also see very little chance of me accomplishing them due to my problems never being resolved. I dont want to follow the societal norm and do what everyone does which is get a shitty job, buy/rent an apartment, spend all my minimum wage money on rent/food/other necessities/car insurance/etc., taking away my time and never be able to actually enjoy my life and never having enough money to escape and fix my situation (in other words be in an infinite loop of spending all my time working, then spending all the money on things I need and never having enough to fix my situation). I hate this because I dont have much choice and either way im probably going to hate my life.

When I was in elementary school I was bullied a ton. A big portion as to why I was bullied was because of my chubbiness. I have never had friends really other than my online ones, who also essentially started bullying me but in a different way. I dont have friends and have never really had friends. I dont hold up much hope that I will ever make many friends because people often just betray me in some way. I am almost certain that I have other mental conditions because some things that I experience I know arent normal, which I feel like is part of the reason why I cant make friends easily. Another reason why I feel like I cant make friends is because of my veganism. I cant really be friends with someone who support the suffering that other species have to go through. Its fucked. At the end of the day, as long as my conscience is clear and im honouring my code then I would rather have no friends than bad friends. I pretty much have my whole shitty life stuffed up into my head with no one to ever or ever have let me talk to them about it. I went to therapy earlier in the year for a few months, but I stopped going after I started working. But also the fact that I realized that she doesnt actually give a shit if she doesnt get paid, so it makes me feel so shitty going knowing that the only person who will let me talk to them needs to get ""bribed"" to talk to me. Its kinda like prostitution but for mental health lol. Also the fact that it literally doesnt help a lot of the time. Like I talk, then she says something thats completely unhelpful and not really relevant.

Also there is this girl who i met like 3 months ago online. I havent really had much faith in dating over the years, mostly because I didnt really experience high school and focused on content creation whenever the opportunity arised when I was able to do something with a girl. Im currently still a virgin and never actually kissed a girl, (again because of content creation). Anyway this girl online makes me feel loved and she accepts me exactly for who I am. I dont know if I actually love her but she tells me she loves me. She lives in a time zone that is 3 hours behind mine, and lives in a different country. We talk usually everyday, but sometimes she makes me feel like shit because she doesnt often care what I have to say. When I try to open up to her about shit or try to explain shit (which im not and never really have ever been good at \[I thrive in writing and typing\]) she just says something like ""okay"" or ""oh"" and then switches the conversation to something totally different or just stays silent. I know she is real so before you go on and say something about her being fake, I can vouch that she is real. She also isnt really my type. She makes me feel like no one has ever felt before (mostly because ive never felt loved in my whole life), but a big part of me doesnt know if I like her. She says ""i love you"" and I say it back because I dont want to make it awkward but also because I dont want to hurt her feelings. Dont get me wrong, I like her a lot and shes mostly pretty, but I feel like im lowering my standards a ton. Part of me doesnt want to let her go because for one, she tells me that if I leave her then she will actually kill herself (she also has a ton of mental health issues and has tried to kill herself before as well). I also fear that if i let her go, I will never be able to find another girl who likes me like this again (ive had a bunch of girls who have liked me over the years but either relationships barely start and then they end). Also another thing to note is that she isnt vegan and pretty much all my morals and values oppose her current lifestyle.

I dont see how I will ever be able to reach any of my goals or fix my life or be able to escape the ""matrix"". I just fucking hate living so much and pretty much the only thing ive felt in my entire life (except during content creation) has just been pain. I am contemplating suicide more and more and every day that passes my mental health gets worse. I dont really see a point in living if its just shit and will continue being shit until I die. If anyone sees this or has any suggestions please let me know. I have so many more issues, but these are the biggest ones and the ones that need to be adressed. I may make a part 2 to this post if I get deep in my feelings (which is almost certainly) so if I do make that, I will edit and put ""part 2 posted"" at the bottom of this post. I doubt anyone will see this, and of the people that do I doubt anyone will care to respond, but to anyone who tries to help or give me advice I thank you so much :)

Edit: Also my sleep schedule is horrible. I literally sleep from a couple hours after I get home from work (which is like 4:00pm) to around 2 ish am, then stay awake because thats when my mother and siblings are asleep. Then sleep again at 4pm. But sometimes I fall asleep earlier because the only things I can rlly do is eat, watch tv, play video games and lye on my bed/sleep which fucks my sleep schedule more. I want to be awake as little as possible when my mother and siblings are awake. I hate them so much. I used to sleep during the day and ideally would like to continue doing that then wake up at the start of the night but cant because of work so my sleep schedule is so fucked. Also the girl I was talking about is 3 hours behind me which is just another reason to be up at night."	devinearth	post	16.642966893420553	female	White	0.9984037280082703	na	na	na	6	depression_help

"Pain is temporary. I also had a painful past and did not want to continue. I’m glad I did. 
If you ever think “today is the day” then please just sleep on it until the next day and continue putting it off. One day you’ll wake up and everything will be different in a good way and you’ll be glad. Find out who you are. You seem to put a lot of emphasis on others and how they react to you or treat you. Read motivational books and find hobbies that make you happy or even just distract you. Put everything you have into bettering yourself. When you finally emerge from that- things will be different. For me, it meant going no-contact with a large majority of my family including my mother. It’s extremely painful, but as you get older you begin to create relationships with people who truly ARE family. There’s a quote that’s often misquoted, “Blood is thicker than water”. The actual quote is, “The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb”. It means that chosen bonds are more significant than blood relatives. 
When you work on yourself and become someone you’re proud of you will be unstoppable and your true family will reveal themselves to you. 
Good luck brother. Don’t give up. Nothing is permanent and you have the power to change yourself."	devinearth	reply	na	na	na	0.9984037280082703	weak	strong	no	na	depression_help

With all due respect, you sound young. Everyone struggles for decades financially when they first start out. I’m suggesting that you work on yourself because the lessons you learn from doing that work gives you a leg up in every aspect of life. The high paying jobs will come if you work hard enough. Right now you’re part time. Get a full time job, or a better paying job. Instead of playing video games- learn something useful that can be used to get you a high paying job. Grind. It absolutely sucks…I get that. I moved out when I was 18 and put myself into massive debt just trying to make it. I ate rice and hot sauce for dinners. I couldn’t afford to eat breakfast or lunch and so I starved. It was painful and hard. Things are still hard, but they get easier. I’m in my thirties, so I can tell you that each decade you’re alive is better than the last. Find a way. Become an entrepreneur and create your own business. You have to take initiative and do the work, or your situation won’t improve. If you need to move somewhere that has better paying jobs- then do it. Joining the military should probably also be on the table. They pay for your education, you get to travel, they pay you a salary, you learn valuable life lessons and they pay for your living expenses. It’s not for everyone though, which I understand, but if your situation is that bad than I seriously doubt the military would be worse. Your situation can’t be fixed by anyone other than you, which is why I say you need to work on yourself. You need to motivate yourself somehow. I hope it all works out for you. I know you’re in pain and I’m sorry. I wish we didn’t have to struggle like this, but most of us do. Just don’t give up. Good luck…and don’t quit your job until you have something else lined up.	devinearth	reply	na	na	na	0.9984037280082703	weak	no	no	na	depression_help

"That sounds really difficult. 

This might be above Reddit’s pay grade, but I’d recommend the podcast where shall I begin by Esther Perel. There are many, many, different topics people discuss, and I guarantee you some will be relevant to you (and the ones that aren’t directly relevant are still relevant in having a framework of seeing how people develop narratives in their minds, and why they are reacting the way they do)

I’d also recommend watching Stutz on Netflix or even couples therapy on Showtime. 

Therapy is like dating, and personally I suspect therapists have an even wider range of efficacy than people suspect. It’s why I recommend these resources, to get a sense of what exceptional therapy looks like. CBT is also the most common practiced form of therapy due to insurance reimbursement, and that might not be the best fit for you. 

I hope you get through this OP, I’m rooting for you. Also, check out my answer to your math question.

There are many characteristics that make up one’s personality. Personally, I’d rather have someone in my life who is kind, curious, thoughtful, supportive and genuine. I’ll gladly take that any day over someone who is “good” at piano or “good” at math. It sounds like you might be struggling with a lot of feelings of guilt and self worth and how you define yourself.

I’m truly sorry that you are having these thoughts, I know how difficult it is to feel that way. I told my therapist that sometimes not existing seemed comforting. I told him that I had responsibilities, but not existing anymore became attractive to me sometimes. It resulted in a productive discussion on triggers for these thoughts, and the daily movements of the mind that resulted in this type of existential crisis. We talked a lot about coping techniques, and finding deeper meaning in life. I had to change therapists a few times because I did not feel enough of a connection with some of them to open up. I also would give it a month or so, and if I saw no progress I changed therapists. Finally, I found the right combination of therapy and medication. I also started using guided meditations for depression on YouTube everyday, which helped far more than I thought it would. The guided meditation got me off of medication. It’s really important to be honest with your therapist. Just phrase it in a way that they know that this is a recurring thought that you have. They can’t help if they don’t know. I pray that you start to feel much better soon.	badusernamething	reply	na	na	na	0.9861981272697449	strong	strong	no	na	depression_help

Trigger warning for suicide and subtle themes of SA and gender dysphoria/trans discrimination. 

Hey! So it's gonna take a lot to open up about this but I'm a trans, autistic 17 year old guy on the way to get a. ADHD diagnosis too. I've been struggling my whole life with school and bullying essentially.

Recently I fell out a bit with a guy I thought was my best mate and I could lean on. And I have a cert iii and year 12 to juggle on top of being trans and navigating that and my nerodiversity. 

I've been feeling suicidal lately too. It's beloved this is cause I switched to different meds last week. Been crying almost everyday and am getting overly worked up. My autism overstimulates me too and makes light and noise a massive problem for me.

I go to a public school also which I feel I am unfit for. This year I got awfully bullied my hair being pulled, being punched and kicked, sexually harassed/touched and a lot more. The transphobia and the ignorance is very real ATM.  

I just need a reason not to commit. I feel like any day now I will. Last day of school last week I almost jumped. Did it. Felt I needed to be brave and have this nightmare over. But I couldn't.

I have a new therapist I've only seen twice. It felt like my road to recovery started at square one when I was transferred to her, and our sessions are only a half hour long and infrequent. I feel like such a jumbled mess that I can't explain to her what I am feeling, and then the session ends and it feels like progress wasn't made and I just want to fucking cry.

"If you’re feeling it, it’s not a nothing problem! Remember though, a therapists job is literally to be there and not judge you! You could tell her that you feel like you’re not making progress in session and don’t know how to change that and could use more guidance because it all gets so jumbled. It’s her job to help you navigate that. Ask if there is anything you can do before session to prepare and dedicate time to any tips she may have! 

Also remember that sometimes starting with a new therapist is slow as you get to know each other and trust her. It’s normal, but if you keep feeling that way it also might mean she’s not the right fit for you and that is OKAY. 

Did you have a therapist you’ve liked before this one? Is there anything you can think of that they did that helped you gather your thoughts in or out of session? You can also give a therapist feedback. I know it seems scary, but they are there to help and listen! I once literally told a therapist that something she said really hurt my feelings. I’ve told therapists I need them to say more for the professional relationship to work. I’ve fill in ended sessions early because I’m just not feeling it. All of this is okay.

i know it sounds ridiculous, but academics have been such a huge thing for me my whole life because i’m terrified of not being able to find a well-paying job in the future where i can support myself and live comfortably 
i’ve just always been the dumbest person in the family and they pretty much agree on it as well, around middle school i started to think i had adhd but felt so guilty and terrified about it 
i started antidepressants ofor the first time one month ago, and while it has helped with the brain fog and memory retention, i still an incredibly depressed, but i don’t want to try a different one because this one is sometimes used to help with adhd, and i know i’ll never get a diagnosis as an adult and as a woman 
every time i thought i might fail a class i get really dangerous thoughts, and i failed calc 2 last semester
i know it’s nothing terrible and by far the least of a problem anyone could have, but i’ve just been so used to academics being everything to me that i know if i fail it again, i’ll feel it again

You can have an exceptional life regardless of how you perform on an exam. You can even have a great life and job without having great academic success. Millions of people in this world do extraordinary things, and live meaningful lives without doing well in school. You are a completely unique creation. You have thoughts, feelings, insights, interests, talents, skills, and charisms that you can put to use in this world. You are young and your families values are important to you right now. Academics is important to your family, but it doesn’t have to be the center of your life. You can develop your own value system, you can be your own person. Never let anyone else define what you most value in this world, or your intelligence. You are definitely not dumb. You may struggle with subjects that do not really interest you. Seek out those subjects and activities  (academic and non-academic) that interest you the most, and you will succeed. Know and believe that you can do great things that contribute to a world that desperately needs people just like you. Live a life that is defined by love, ethical behavior, pursuit of your passions, faith, a willingness to work, and a belief in yourself. You will mature, and you will look back on this exam as a minor event in your life. It doesn’t seem like it in this moment, but it’s true.

"That bastard just keeps chugging along.

The goddamn regret...I had a vague sense at the time that I was missing out, not doing what I wanted to do, letting my life slip away.  And now I look back on so many solemn memories, isolation, fear, humiliation... A wasteland.

What's that?  You can't change the past?  What psycho thinks that?  Acceptance?  I've reached my limit for now.  For some torturous reason, I'm surrounded by people revelling in the past.  Sharing moments.  Dipping into it and becoming awash with wonderment. There's a joy I'll never know in that, and I'm resentful.  

If only it was the past.  If only how I am today was stronger because of it.  But I'm broke down by the road with my little sign and if I'm lucky I get a small break from myself from time to time.  Enough sleep for a nursery.  Enough survival to keep maybe my nose above water.

" 

Hi, so I've been struggling mentally. A lot. I have depressive episodes where I'll cry for a REALLY long time, especially if I'm alone and have no one distract me. (or if I'm talking to someone about my anxiety/issues) I'm currently obsessed with my eating habits and I hate it. It started when I had no appetite as a result from the stress of school, then when I noticed, I tried eating more and ended up making myself feel ""sick"". I would gag, feel nausea, etc. I'm eating more now, but I feel like I'm eating too much to the point where I can't go two hours without eating because I hate the feeling of my stomach being empty. I shake and get scared. This has been emotionally tolling on me. I quit school, I lost interest in doing fun things, and when I'm doing said fun things I can only think about food. If I'm gonna go hungry or not, or if I'm gonna gag in front of people. (which has happened a lot this year, I hate gagging, it happens either the start of a meal, in the middle, or after). I cannot concentrate, I am obsessed with my health, I'm scared something is wrong with my throat since most times I struggle to swallow, but I've only had two appointments. One blood test, which showed low vitamin D levels and nothing helpful in the 2nd. Just pepcid, but I'm not having acid problems :/. I am also attending therapy, but only had one session, and my next will have a new therapist due to unfortunate circumstances. So now I have to start over, talk about my problems, rather than continuing to work on them from the first session. I have been like this for MONTHS, some weeks are better, some are not. Lately it has not, I feel super depressed, hopeless, etc.

So, what does this have to do with moving? Well, I currently live with my boyfriend and his family. His mom is nice, his dad is quiet and grouchy cuz he's old, but not mean. However, I no longer feel comfortable in their presence. I feel like I am seen as a burden because I don't have a job, I'm not going to school, and it's because I'm trying to work on myself. (I gagged three times on my way to class, so...) But whenever his mom tells me, ""I really believe you can go to school, you are strong enough, but you have to go back. Think about your future, I was disappointed when you dropped your class last semester."" I just... Break down. Like she asks what's wrong with me mentally as if she cares, but then turns around to make it about herself. ""You know, I have anxiety too, but you have to learn to push those thoughts away. I see you in your room and notice how mopey you are and it's really unfortunate.""

Hearing this a lot lately has taken a toll on my mental health, I know they're concerned, but they're just telling me things I already know. So I'm reminded of shit I'm not proud of. I love my boyfriend so much. He takes me to my doctor appointments, the store when I need my ""safe food"", and tries his best to distract me. Cheer me up, spend time with him. He's a great guy. I just feel like I overstayed my welcome here with his parents. I see the way they look at me when I leave my room, I know what they think. They are nice, patient, but I can just tell they see me as extra weight. They want me to get a job, go back to school, but I just am so lost right now I just want to focus on making myself feel like my old self again. I am lacking emotional support from them. I understand though, I'm just another mouth to feed, and they have bills to pay.

So... If I were to move in with my sister or mom, I would have the emotional support of my own family, medical, and even financial. However, I'd be away from my boyfriend and even my friends. My mom lives about 3 or 4 hours away from us, so it wouldn't be bad... but, I kinda don't wanna live with her. My brother lives there and he is kinda toxic, she also doesn't have hot water, and I wouldn't have my own room.

However, if I move in with my sister, who is like my best friend, I will have a very comfortable environment to live in. She will help me, support me, and not pressure me to do things I don't feel comfortable doing yet. BUT! She lives in Vegas, which means my boyfriend will be even more far. I live in California, so depending on traffic, it'd be a 5-6 hour drive. I'm scared that won't help and even make my mental health problems worse. Also, if I move in with her, then it'll be hard for my bf to convince his parents to take me back again. They'd probably be hesitant to take me back, so I'd end up not being able to live with him for... God knows how long. (I'm 24 and he's 22, we do not make a lot of money to live anywhere, just the two of us. Renting, in THIS economy??? Not realistic.)

So either I stay here, start my new job next week, figure out ways to cope with my GAD/eating disorder alone until my next therapy session, and just deal with problems on my own.

Or

I can move away from my boyfriend and his family, and work on fixing myself FIRST with the support of my sister.

I know life is hard and can be uncomfortable, which is why I'm trying so hard to push through. I can't always live comfortably. But I wanted to work on myself FIRST before getting a job and going back to school. I understand why they are impatient, I have been like this since May, but that's because I was struggling to understand what was happening to me. I had no insurance, and got it activated just last month. I just need more time, but I feel like they've run out of it.

"The only thing that has worked for me came out of a book called Atomic Habits. I didn't even read it, there's a video on YouTube that summarizes it. 

The basic idea is to set things up to make it easy. In your case, that might mean leaving your study materials out all the time in plain sight. Then you create a chain of things you do in the same order every day. So maybe for you that would be get up, have coffee, brush teeth, study for 30 minutes, take a walk, study another 30 minutes. 

This is the only way I can stick to an exercise schedule, and sooner or later something interrupts it (family visit, etc.) and it takes me weeks to get back to doing my schedule, but once I start I'm good until the next interruption."	robin_f_reba	reply	na	na	na	0.9993454813957214	no	strong	no	na	depression_help

A long time ago i was studying to become a paramedic. I was good, had very high result. Used to think that anything under 90% wasnt a good thing. Didnt take long before i fell into a depression because i was overworking myself. I had a belt tied like a noose inside my closet and every couple of days i tried killing myself. Decided to quit my study and after a month, my depression and suicidal idea just went away like magic. You see, i was simply very tired. My depression was but a symptom of me being overworked.

"I think a combination of different things are seriously harming my psyche. I just went months sober and I was mentally much better. But recently I just spent a long time smoking thca weed again because I didn't initially notice any negative side effects only positive ones. Then I started playing videogames all day again to kill boredom then at night I'd binge porn and I also keep watching negative videos that creates a bleak perspective on everything.. I keep hopelessly falling back into a negative train of thought and I keep getting faced with a reality I've been desperately trying to avoid.

I keep actively and consciously telling myself my life is over and I won't have friends or love or happiness and its caused me to believe it and seek ways of coping with this emptiness. I'm afraid to face the world and try to build a life for myself because I'm worried about being alone through my struggles. It makes me depressed and suicidal and I hate feeling this way. I want to reprogram my brain and believe that I can have meaningful connections with others again and that I'm deserving of love and happiness.

"Hiya, Venting\_Ghost! Hope you're doing well!  
The fact that you desire connections, love and happiness obviously tells everyone that you are a hopeful and kindhearted person. 

Know that you are never truly alone. You want to reach out to others, and so you will meet other people who you can hang out with. 

Try to focus on the things you want to do. Not necessarily gaming 24/7, but if you do: try making something fruitful out of those habits. For example: record your gaming footage, make a fun short out of it and post it on social media. It's a silly example (tho very actual...), but I think you get my point, right?

I, too, struggle every day with my motivation... so I change my lack of motivation into motivation... by giving other people motivation. It's an infinite loop. I have found my personal infinitely renewable energy! :v

🫂 I understand and you are not alone. It takes time to be sober and more time to continue to be sober. I have been afraid of many types of people and situations too. What we can do is whenever we get a compatible person with whom we feel comfortable, we need to care for them.

Me too. We need to do something about it. Let's find ideas about making good friendships at work. I thought of complimenting someone whose sense of dress I liked from the start, I said and she thanked me and appreciated my bracelet. But then over. I couldn't keep the conversation going. I felt like a failure but still whenever we meet in life or in line in the canteen, we just say hi-bye or smile. She thinks that I see her as my beauty idol and I think I am her idol for choosing jewellery. 🤣 Yeah, we most girls can take a compliment that heartfelt.  It's my small step in socializing. You wanna try this? Do you have any other ideas? I am in the same situation but I have some beautiful moments of friendship in the past about which I have written in my gratitude journal and that motivates me that I can have those simple cool adorable friends. I am sure you can have the same. Why do you feel difficulty in friendships? I mean do you have social anxiety too like me? I am sure we can win friends.

Well I've never actually considered it but I think I may have some kind of psychological disorder like antisocial personality or something. I'm not sure what or why exactly but I struggle to enjoy other's company. Pretty much every friend in the past I've abandoned and part of me doesn't believe I'm capable of having a deep connection with anyone. I always see examples of friend groups in movies and tv shows and part of me thinks it's just sappy and stupid. I've always been pretty content alone but I think by isolating myself I'm depriving my brain of certain chemicals that are essential for maintaining a healthy mood and outlook on life.

"Hmmm.. that's true. Being isolated for the long term can make us feel behind and less confident because we are not aware about our social environment and this can create anxiety. I am in the same situation too and need help for the same. I don't know where my life is going. I just want to feel without regrets when I sleep at night. I am sure you feel the same.

I feel mostly sleepy and tired because one I miss the guy I loved ( special for me), second, I have isolated myself for many months ( 10- 11 ) and I feel highly scared sometimes. You are not alone. We all struggle to be sober and stay sober. But all I want is to just sleep at night without any regrets and sorrow. I need to respect myself and this life I got. I am sure you want to try too, that's why you posted here. You know you feel alone and you don't like it, so do what can make YOU feel better and more calm. Apart from these baby steps in socializing, feeding animals helps me a lot especially the street dogs, cats or others. Seeing the gratefulness and purity in their eyes reduces my anxiety and motivates me to socialize more. Just go to the garden and watch the kids. Their innocence and even talking can motivate us a lot. And giving a compliment works magic. Please try this. Just compliment someone tomorrow with full heart for anything you like about them. Their happiness can give us confidence and make us feel accompanied. Tell me if it works for you. Good night. 🙏"	Venting_Ghost	reply	na	na	na	0.9981542229652405	weak	strong	no	na	depression_help

"I get depression from about October/November till about March/April. I presume it seasonal but it's a terrible time to be depressed as this is when people are supposed to be happy so a lot of my friends & family tend to just leave me be over winter.  

Last year was particularly bad when I lost a close friend in October, this was rite when my depression kicks in. This all accumulated with me self harming a lot, completely losing myself in drink to blackout point several times week. I would wake up cut and slashes on me. Almost lost my job as I need to work with vulnerable people at times (I know I'm not fit to do this but I'm doing my best and trying to work on things).  

This year has been worrying in that I never felt my depression lift the way it usually does. I usually get really active over summer doing everything from camping, rearranging my full flat, holidays but this year nothing. Its August and I'm already depressed. My drinking and self destructive behaviour seems to be setting in early.  

I always worry over winter that one of these mornings I'm not going to wake up because I've done something ridiculous which is a horrible thing to do to my friends and family.  

Does anyone else live like this? Where evey year seems that you go through the same cycle only getting worse each time? I just wish people would understand how black and dark everything becomes during depression and that all the bad and self destructive behaviour isnt who we 2ant to be."

"I have never had a partner mainly because I have a diagnosed avoidant attachment, consequence of bad parenting.

I can't stand when some people find out that I have no experience in relationships and look at me with a pitying face, as if that invalidates the rest of the successes I've had in life. In the end all they value is physique and having a lot of relationships.

Also, when I realize how easy life has been for these people, I can't help but feel a deep contempt for society and for humans. I try to calm down and not express it because I know that the next day I will be better.

"I feel a need to raise a question. What happens when people have sex? 
So from a person who has given it some thought. What is actually happening? 
Cause in porn the only show the great parts, right? And the amount of time sex happens when makeup is actually on? From life experience, it is a rare thing for people to be dressed up and looking fancy. 
Or stories, fictions of lovers sweeping another off their feet after fighting, etc. The brave hero that saves the day. 
In real life, sex is messy. Its gross, naked sweating bodies slapped into each other with no actual beat or plan. It's cramped legs and weird back stuff. It's wet and sticky, and some people have to worry about pregnancy. Everyone has to worry about STDs.  And after people are done slamming each other fluids at the other person. Then what? Emotions could be high! Or even worse one high on one side. What do you say? Did you wanna meet this person again? Did you have fun or was it a bad fit? 

Here is my advice, not that you asked for it about this topic but it's free. Find someone to laugh with. Find someone that can giggle and feel safe with cause the first few times aren't gonna be all that great. But you will get better, but having some one that cares how you feel and can make jokes and laugh with you and not at you.  It's better to laugh about it tthantake it ppersonally, too. It's better to understand that you will learn quickly because you will listen to what your partner says, what is good or bad.

"It’s ridiculous how much I can’t do things. I need to start my school work for this week and just can’t bring myself to do it.
I can tell myself all day long that my hard work gets me to my goals but it doesn’t help. I feel like I physically can’t move from the couch. Yet, I’m bored.
I have good weeks and bad weeks.

Does anyone have any tips for SEVERE lack of motivation? This isn’t just telling myself I can do it or scheduling it in a calendar. It’s avoidance."	hiddenprides	post	14.683185815779353	male	White	0.9992969036102295	na	na	na	2	depression_help

I think part of it is making the goals achievable. Telling yourself « I have SOOOO much work I HAVE to do this » can be super overwhelming. But « I’m just going to read for 15 mins and then I get to reward myself » might frame it in your mind better and make it less intense	hiddenprides	reply	na	na	na	0.9992969036102295	no	no	no	na	depression_help
"Have you ever been in a situation where you try to address a problem with your partner, but they become defensive, and the conversation goes nowhere? making it harder to resolve issues and maintain intimacy.  If so, you’re not alone.  

Defensiveness is a way of protecting ourselves from feeling guilty, ashamed, or threatened by someone else’s criticism or feedback. 

it can take many forms, including **verbal attacks**, **denial**, **fabrication**, **avoidance**, and **gaslighting**.

But **""why do we get defensive in the first place, and what can we do to overcome it?""**

I made an animated video to illustrate the topic after reading research studies and articles. If you prefer reading, I have included important reference links below.

  
hope you find this informative!

  
Cheers!

I use metal music or more aggressive rap like tech nine, hopsin, icp, and the people that play with them.

I know it's the depression talking right, but I am just so apathetic about life; I don't value my existence.  All I do is cry about how I wish I had the courage to end it, but I just don't have it, but I wish with all my heart that I could leave. And no one is going to accommodate you in this life like no matter how much you don’t want to be here you have to keep living it until you have the courage to end it and nobody will wait, nobody will give you grace. This makes me feel held captive and trapped. I want to leave but I cannot do it. I don't know how to just 'stop' feeling this way. And I have people around me who love me and who I am incredibly grateful to have but that doesn't change my outlook at all, which seems so illogical. I've been in therapy a few times and I'm hearing all the techniques and I know exactly how to intellectualise my pain and how to solve it theoretically, but still I feel like this. Any tips at all would help.	Best-Friend7982	post	27.006906354767217	female	White	0.9982751607894897	na	na	na	3	depression_help

It's all about action.  Most of the time, we take action when we need to. If your house was on fire, you would take action.  If a child was screaming in pain, you would take action.  Depression needs to be treated the same way. It is hard to disconnect how we feel when we are in a depressive state, but to get results, we must take action. I found that when I finally forced myself to start to try, I accidentally began to discover that it wasn't so bad and that I even began to enjoy some things again.

I know binge watching certain pessimistic material has cultivated a negative outlook on life for me so watching the opposite could help. I'm about to try it myself but I already watch one person's videos which have helped me numerous times in the past. One interesting thing he said was to imagine that reality is like a big warehouse containing everything but it's pitch black and you have a flashlight.

I’ve dealt with this as well. You need to remove the guilt from when you do it. It’s a normal thing. If you’re a single person you need to have a sexual release done by yourself every now and then. I’m in a relationship and I take care of it myself when I’m not with my partner. My partner knows and she doesn’t have a problem with it. Of course you can do it too much though and I dealt with that in the past. You just need to regulate how much you do it. You don’t have to quit cold turkey.

"I'm 19, I've been struggling with depression from a PTSD that went without a cure for years. It feels like I won't find my peace anymore. I just feel the void, I just feel like I don't belong here, I don't belong in people's lives, I am in isolation mode since Covid pandemic and it hurts so bad. 
It's fake what they say about people who are ready to support you, the truth is that when you have these type of problems and you act a certain way, who wanted to help doesn't understand that maybe that's the true moment you need help, but just classifies you as a bad person. 
And it breaks me that even paying people who studied for that, you can't resolve anything, I don't even know what happened. 2 professionals dropped me off from their therapy, the first one told me she wasn't the right person for me, the second one just casually dropped me off by ghosting me. 
All the struggle I had, trying to speak without hurting, without trying of over reacting, with expressing my volunteer of change, it was useless even for them. And I feel so tired. 
I may have great people around me but it feels just loneliness. I wake up and I am alone, I go on with my day alone even if I try to meet up with them often. And when I do I ultimately feel the void again. 
And when I speak with others it's always like my issues aren't that big. Even if I have full time panic attacks, self-harm moments, strong suicidal thoughts and times when I am so deep hopeless. The cries with scratching my face with my nails trying to make the pain something physical.

" I'm getting close to my 31 birthday, and the weight of having wasted all of my life feels heavy tonight.

I was never capable of studying. I wasted years trying to go to college, I never had any dream to fight for, any desire to follow, any goal any direction. If it wasn't because of my grandmother and her contacts, that got me a job at the state, I would be working at mcdonalds. Now I'm a useless parasite living from tax money. I am so lazy I can't even look for things to learn. I can't focus even on self help videos for too long.

I never had conversation topics with people. I never had what to fill conversations with. No hobbies, no interests, not even likes. I do play games and watch fiction, but those are the topics people care the least about. They're no good for conversations. Topics about work I have to avoid because I'm a failure that never accomplished nor will accomplish anything and that's too shameful.  
I always let other people talk, lead the conversation, I can even ask questions and engage, but as soon as it's my turn to share it becomes straight up awkward.

Since I've always been too pathetic I could never even try to approach women. I never had nor will ever have a girlfriend because of this. I can't even dance with women. I can't flirt. And even if those obstacles weren't there, I also can't hold conversations and neither do I have anything interesting or even remotely attractive about myself.

A group of friends ""adopted"" me in college, I manage to make some friends thanks to gaming and they made more friends and I was, just kind of there. I have kept making the effort to go to social events, birthdays, clubs, and now, electronic parties. But it never got to the point where I could enjoy any of these events. being around people just sacres me too much. Having women dancing close to me make me cower away. I'm so pathetic that I despise myself.

There's just nothing to expect from the future, nothing to expect out of weekends, nothing to expect out of life. Tonight, alone without anything interesting to do despite being saturday, the weight of being a pathetic loser and failure just weights too much.

I want to die so bad. I hate being alive, I hate being awake. I hate being conscious. All I want is to do harm myself to dull the pain of being alive. I want to punch my face until I break my skull.

Ever since I can remember it has been my mother the reason why I never tried to actually end me.

But I began this week to finally test how well the skin of my forearms does against some knives that I have. They're not good, they don't have enough edge, and I don't have the strength, because as in all things I'm just a pathetic coward.

I began to think about a suicide letter, I began to think about getting a better knife. I began to consider how I can leave the people I will leave behind without guilt, because it was me and me alone the one responsible for this. I'm just so tired of living for them, living so I would not cause them pain, I'm tired of being alive.

I wish I wasn't such a big weak coward. I wish I had what it takes to rp my forearms off and be done with this bullshit we call life.

I'm so fucking tired of waking up every day. I'm tired of my mind reminding me every day that I am now who I could have been, and that I've wasted my chances to be.

Since I can't kill myself I will keep harming me. It's the least I deserve."	Frank_Acha	post	15.977934074016218	male	White	0.9992817044258118	na	na	na	3	depression_help

Everything you've explained points to severe depression. All these feelings and thoughts. It's like reading something I would have posted because I feel the same. But written better lol, I'm not a smart man and I have issues vocalizing or even writing down how I feel a lot. But I'm still here trying, and I beg you to do the same. I've fucked up big in my life, and actually ended up having a hobby out of one of my attempts (surfing). It gave me enough motivation to wake up and gave me something to look forward too.

I've been messaging her once or twice a week since, it is hard without any communication but I am just trying to avoid being annoying but also that she means so much I am thinking of her constantly and won't give up on supporting her. I think it is just a coincidence, but for months we had both been looking forward to meeting in person in the summer so this happened like right before I was going to drive to see her. Also, her birthday has passed since this happened and I messaged her offering to buy something or send a card. While she didn't respond, she at least left it on seen so I'm glad that she did that much and also didn't block me so seems she still wants to be friends.

She actually did this two weeks earlier and apologized a few days later saying she was just so depressed she couldn't do anything. At first I thought that was just happening again, but now I've seen her online almost every night and usually with another friend which is what made me realize it is different now and made me start to worry about so many things. She also deleted me on a few things but still has me on the rest which made me a bit confused like she doesn't want to be friends anymore, but also still does. I even thought I might have personally done something because it seems it might only be me that is being ignored, but on one occasion while she was on an online game I was able to spectate her anonymously and can see that she is just different. Most notably, she used to chat a lot with other players but now she is almost completely silent. So it seems something bad must have happened and really messed her up.

At this point, I'm trying to stay supportive but it's starting to make me mad that she is going this long without saying anything. I can get whenever people go silent for a few days or maybe even a few weeks, but two whole months is just starting to feel like too much. Really all I want is for her to just check in and give a simple explanation of what is going on, leaving out the details if she wants. Then she can go back to silence for a while. The fact this is happening but also not knowing what happened and speculating about what could have been so horrible has made me feel the worst emotional pain ever and just getting that explanation would help me feel so much better. I am just feeling so many different ways now and it's been so difficult lately."	HappyNewYear666	post	13.506559351629349	male	White	0.9964531660079956	na	na	na	2	depression_help

"Hiya, HappyNewYear666! Hope you're doing well!

Reading on this story, I can tell that you really care for this person. There's absolutely 0 doubt about that. Do not EVER question yourself being a ""bad friend"" or something along those lines. 

I've also been in a VERY similar situation like yours, it's almost creepy and near 100% identical. Not going to elaborate on that since we're here for **you**!

Don't try (easier said than done...) to ""guess"" what happened or what the cause is of this person not responding to you. Whatever she's going through: it's something she has to work out. It's on her terms that she can do whatever to fight through these difficult times.

It's also on her terms to seek help. Giving help to others is a virtue of people who are worth having around. Receiving help can only work so well if the person in question WANTS to be helped.

In all honesty: she should come clean and just tell her why she hasn't been responding. If she did, which doesn't need to be super detailed: then it's best to give her the time and space she might need.

Let her know that you'll always be there for her, no matter what. And that you'll be waiting whenever she's ready.

In the meantime: focus on yourself. Living for other people's sakes is such a noble thing to do (which I've also done for so long...), but it has to be fruitful. It has to be with a purpose that can strive both parties forward.

You've already proven to be an amazing friend, so don't you worry your little head, dear!

i’ve been planning on killing myself for as long as i can remember. I have in the past year formulated a plan where I was going to slowly over years starve myself to death but now i’ve realized i don’t have the will power to fight my body anymore.(already lost more than 50 pounds) I am planning on ending my life sometime next week and i know my family would be somewhat devastated and i have friends that would be sad but i still want to die idk why it’s not enough to keep me going. i lost my cat yesterday and i feel broken so so so broken yet relieved that i can go now without having to worry about him. idk what’s wrong with me. i don’t know why i can’t just be normal. idk idk. i don’t even think i was supposed to make it this far. and my mom god i can’t leave her but i can’t live life being me anymore, not in this body with these illnesses i just can’t do it anymore.	holyhammstrings	post	15.073584552055262	male	White	0.9933375120162964	na	na	na	3	depression_help

"I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I know the feeling. My mom gets mad at me when I talk to her about it. I know it seems extreme, but these consistent feelings are NOT normal. Even though they seem normal to you, they are NOT. I know I’m just a stranger on the internet, but please look into local hospitals with behavioral health units to check yourself into. You don’t need to be alone in this. There are people who want to listen and understand why you feel this way and help you develop skills and self esteem so you feel better. 

Pet grief is real grief. Just as valid as losing a friend or family member, maybe even worse sometimes. I lost my cat Tinka last year and I wish I would have gotten some grief counseling after. 

I would recommend weekly counseling, if not full admittance to the hospital. You don’t need to feel this way and you don’t have to do it alone."	holyhammstrings	reply	na	na	na	0.9933375120162964	strong	strong	no	na	depression_help

"I've been going through a lot of stuff recently, including losing my phone. I got a new number, but I was so deep into my depression, I only gave it out to a small handful of people. I was scared of contacting friends I hadn't spoken to for a while.

Today, while I was walking through my city, I happened to bump into a friend and her wife, who I haven't seen or spoken to in over a year. Maybe 2 years.

She gave me a big hug, we chatted a little, she gave me her number and we arranged to meet up for a catch up drink.

I have a house
I have a job
I have a family 
I have an incredible boyfriend

I am under 30 years old, but over 25, my past is tainted, but my present is incredible. (Specially in the UK, with the cost of living).

"Hey there, Lollypopsundae!  


To answer your question: yes, this is normal. Normal, in the sense that what you're experiencing/feeling right now is a lot more common than people would think. I, too, often feel what you feel. I also have house, couple of pets, steady job (even tho it's fucking me over right now...), etc. Despite all that: I feel empty and lost.  


It damn sure is a confirmation of us being human, alright. These moments, afaik throughout experience, come and go like the tides of the ocean. It is good that you realize the things that matter to you, that you care about. Do not ever let go of those feelings.  


Take your time to self reflect. I cannot figure this out for you, but try to take your time, day by day, to find an answer to this question: ""Am I missing something in my life?"" If there are: then set a goal for yourself, in whatever timespan you think is doable. If there aren't any: well, count yourself lucky. You have what many on this dirtball of a planet don't: true happiness.

"I am 21 yrs old (M) and my height is 5'8"". So I regularly get called short and get mocked. It would not be that bad had I not been ugly too. I look ugly, have been told and know it myself too.
Even my mom, who loves me so much, sometimes says something or other about my ugly appearance. Owing to all this I made little to no friends and relationships are out of the park for me.

If you feel ugly you can make some changes. First of all you’re still young. As someone who turned 30, for the first time in my life I feel “hot”. And it’s weird to say that at 30 haha. At 21, you might still have some baby fat or struggle to grow a beard. But you’ll come into your own. Let’s say you are actually “ugly” (I doubt it!) - well improve what you have. Get a nice manicure and wax your brows (yes men can do this I’m a man and do it), find a personal style that makes you feel comfortable and attractive, develop a skin care routine, and workout. Lastly take care of your mental. Meditate, don’t smoke or drink too much, and develop personal goals. All of these things will make you more attractive - inside and out. Good luck to you my handsome friend.	Disastrous-Trouble47	reply	na	na	na	0.9872226119041443	weak	strong	no	na	depression_help
"Its partially my fault. Im only attracted to muscular fit women.  I have tried to go for women who arent like that, because i didnt want to think it mattered. But i just didnt feel it. I truly like the excitement of a woman as strong as me, who can play wrestle or arm wrestle and not have to let them win. To me thats sexy and you just cant get it with regular women. You can let them win but thats just..li dont know. Its not satisfying or thrilling.   


Im 39 never been with anyone.  Ive missed my youth because of this and never got to be physical because honestly ive never known any woman who i would physically want to be intimate with in person.  I have tried dating normal women but im not really into it and they can tell.  I didnt wanna be superficial and i really did try but i honestly felt no desire for a relationship with them . And i wasnt gonna lead someone on just because i was lonely, thats not fair. To me or them.

Ive tried everything, dating apps, social media etc. nothing works.

Another problem is ive had depression since 14. Ive been on meds and had therapy. Ive done every self help thing you can. Its never worked over decades. I also have a learning disability which isnt my fault , kind of like autism, and a pituitary gland brain tumour.

Also since i never knew any women id like , i kinda gave up on life and got fat until this ye when i decided to try and get fit. I went from 133kg to 119 in april but then the same thing that always happens happened and i got depressed and alone and ive not lost anything since. I feel like its pointless since theres no women i like at my gym or area and even ones i meet online are taken or not interested, so it really just makes me feel why even bother since theres no hope.

I dont even know why im writing this, ive become really bitter and angry at life. I get angry when i see guys with girls id love to be with at the injustice. I try and think not to be bitter and be happy for others but even when i fake it i cant. Its turned me into a bitter person no matter how much i try to be better. I resent women even to an extent. Not all but some.

Idk what to do any more. If it wasnt for my brother and sister whom it would kill, id end my life. Im so so so tired of feeling this way and being bitter, and even when i try nothing goes right for me."

I am a 21f and I’m miserable. I have a wonderful 21m boyfriend who I love very much but in every other aspect of my life, I’m so unhappy. I hate my job but due to contract I have to stay a year and I’m almost there but it’s hard, I’ve hated it since month 3. I hated being full time at my day job so after 6 months of trying, I finally changed my schedule and I’m just as burnt out and miserable as I was before, but now I’m extremely poor and can barely afford to live. I have no prospects once I leave expect for even worse jobs. I dropped out of college after a year and I’ve contemplated going back but I don’t feel interested in anything anymore. I don’t want to be in severe debt and I’ll be required to payback what I owe already starting in September. I want to move out of the country when I can but without a degree or a good bit of money, I have no value to add making getting a visa very hard. I enlisted in the military almost 3 years ago with high hopes and dreams, no I wasn’t lied to I chose to enlist purely on my own. I regret it everyday. I have 3 years left on my contract and even as a reservist I hate it. Every drill I truly hope to be hit by a car so I don’t have to go. I finally talked to my command about what was going on and I tried to seek a medical discharge due to mental health and was told it was just “adjusting to a new unit” even though it’s been almost a year and my leadership is great but I feel like my soul has been drained from me. I got injured during training and even years later I still feel the pain and it’s worse than it was. Of course they did nothing when I tried to have it checked out. My mental health tanked at basic and has only gotten worse. I have panic attacks far more frequently and my passive suicidal ideations are getting less and less passive every month. I was bullied as a kid and became so angry and hateful as a child and I spent nearly a decade working on it and I was happy. Truly I was ok. But after just a few weeks at basic I was just as angry and hateful as before and I can’t figure how to make it stop. I also had starting to become deeper in my faith and I felt good with it. But the military has destroyed that too. The world has. I still believe in Gob but I can no longer believe he is good and loving. I can’t tell anyone how I feel or how I’m struggling religiously because my family would practically disown me. I feel lost as I’ve spent my whole life being Christian and I’m not even sure what to consider myself anymore. I’m scared I’ll go to hell but I just don’t believe in a good living god anymore. I have no friends near me and only like 2-3 in general but not ones I’m extremely close with. My family lives 13 hours away and only my mom is really supportive of me. I feel no hope for my future or my life and I don’t want to die but I wish I could just not be alive. I can’t remember the last time I was truly happy. I have no energy or desire to do anything anymore. Even the things I used to love and want to do, I can’t. The effort just to get up and make the bed each day is exhausting. I’m so lonely. I’m so miserable and depressed. My anxiety just continues to worsen and when I do happen to have the rare day I’m not hating my life, part of me feels guilty. Like maybe I’m faking my anxiety and depression even though I know I’m not. I just feel like a failure and waste of space and a burden. I’m just so unhappy and I needed some place to get it out. I’m sorry for the rant, I just feel like I have no one to talk to except strangers whose lives are not affected by me. It’s not a burden when you don’t care I suppose.

"In the same boat over here. I've been in the navy for 2.5 years and I feel like the shell of the person I was before. I struggle with feeling like a failure and a burden too, and the loneliness is crippling at times, but I watched my sister get medically separated for mental health issues and she's worlds happier now. It does get better.

Keep pushing medical to listen and if there's leadership you trust enough to talk to, see if they can help you push it through to get separated. You are strong, you are loved, you deserve to be happy, you are not and never will be a failure.

God told me to enlist in the first place. He put me in the position I’m in now. I’m in worse mental health than I’ve ever been and I believe he told me to enlist as a punishment. I’ve endured more in my childhood than a child ever should and I’ve seen the evil of the world and people close to me be hurt by it and god let it happen. I will not beg forgiveness anymore. What kind of good loving god allows these things to happen? I saw a paradox about god. It basically talked about free will and if he could’ve created free will without evil and if he could and didn’t, he’s not good and if he couldn’t, than he’s not all powerful. It feels very true. What kind of god makes 613 rules KNOWING it’s impossible to not break a single one and then punishes for breaking them? Not a loving one. I do not need forgiveness from a god who doesn’t love me. He needs mine for all the things he’s put me and my loved ones through.	Prestigious_Sink668	follow-up	na	na	na	0.999450147151947	no	strong	no	na	depression_help
"When I get depressed I don't get sad, I get angry. This week my depression came back with a vengeance and it slowly built up. I started getting angry at everything and everyone, having outbursts, throwing and punching things. I kept waking up thinking ""fuck the world, fuck this, fuck that"" in my first 30 seconds of being awake. For some reason, I don't know what triggers it, the memories of my abuse and abusers keep coming up and all it does is fuel my anger

Then yesterday I ""relapsed"" and felt suicidal after not feeling that way for almost a year. I didn't want to feel that way, but it was still there.

 I'm trying to improve my life, see the good side of things, doing creative things that would help me, but it all keeps coming back to feeling angry, isolated, and mad that I didn't stand up for myself in the past when I was verbally assaulted by bullies or other people in my life I trusted too much.

"Hiya, marykreddit38!  


As a victim of severe bullying and abuse myself: I actually find myself in the same situation of being extremely ""flammable"", in the sense that the slightest thing could set me off in a burst of anger. It is good that you're trying your darndest to improve your life and see the bright side. You not standing up back then is not a mistake. It's a lesson you've learned from. Somewhere in your life, you might've had a similar experience of which you, purposely, didn't stand up. Maybe because you knew it was pointless to do so, because it wouldn't get you any positive result. Or because you realized it would've been wasting your time on something futile. 

You are here now. Your past has molded you to the person you are today. Despite everything: I can tell that you are kindhearted and wish no one harm. It's possible that you might feel ""afraid"" or anxious that you might accidentally hurt someone because of these outbursts and thoughts. It's possible that you might feel alone and see suicide as the only way out.

Truthfully: there are multiple way ""out"", and suicide (which I've also attempted multiple times... good thing I suck at it) is the WORST way out. 

Now, I'm not gonna say why suicide is bad and what it does to your loved ones and family, etc. It's something we've all heard already when talking about suicide to someone you were open about it with.

What I am gonna say is: I am SO happy that you're still here. Try to assess where you are now. What you have now. Take a deep breath in............ and out....  and ask yourself this: ""What do I truly want."" 

&#x200B;

I'm here for you if you wish to talk!

I wish you a lovely day!   ❤"	marykreddit38	reply	na	na	na	0.9987275004386902	weak	strong	no	na	depression_help

"I have a 23-year-old brother who is unemployed, has no college education or training, still lives at home with mom and dad, and has mental health struggles. My brother has severe anxiety, depression, and agorophobia. My family has been at a loss on how to suppport him and try and coax him into working again. We are able to support him to the best of our abiltiies right now but are hoping that we can find some way for him to make money to help support the family.  We are really hoping he can get some kind of income to help pay bills, food, and since my family is getting older. My dad is in his mid 50's and my mom is about to be 50 this year. We are all thinking towards the future and I have had many discussions with my parents about how life will be if my brother does not try to get work.

I have no issue with helping my brother and giving him shelter I would never kick him out. However I hope he will be able to help support monetarily. He does cleaning, cooks his own meals,  he watch over and feed the pets.  So he does help  when he is mentally well enough to but refuses to work.

He goes through severe depressive episodes where he only sleeps or eats and does not come out of his room. He once was involuntarily held at a psch facility for suicidal ideation and stayed for about two weeks. 

One of his friends begged him to work at Fed-Ex with him so he worked for a few months but his friend ended up changing shifts and after that he refused to go back. He does not handle changes well. 

He has many  physical ticks like he cannot stop snapping his fingers or picking at his skin. Sometimes he will go for weeks without showering. He rarely leaves the house and only leaves to go to places he is familiar with, he hates trying new foods, he likes familiarity above all. 

We tried to get him on social security but living in New England I feel they have stricter requirements for disability. When we first applied my family had to force him to go to therapy to try and bolster his case. My mom and dad got him back into counseling but then he was rejected for social security disability. Now we figured going into it he would be rejected but we would try again but it's a lot of hassle and he has no interest in trying to get on social security.

I want to help  my brother and support him but I don't know how. 

Under our current capitalist system it is work or die so we have to figure out some way for him to make money.

I'd love to assist him in getting back into therapy but he won't tell his therapist or us anything about his life. I love my brother but he is a stranger to me at the same time. All I know abbout him is that he likes video games and pop culture like I do.

Now I am not close to my brother no one in my family is close to him. We all know very little about him.

We have all tried to have a heart to heart with him but none of us are able to break past his walls. He clams up and shuts us out and while I wish I didn't have to pressure him thinking long-term it will be unsustainable for us to keep supporting him.

My family and I have discussed potential options for jobs that he could do.

I was thinking he could try doing some type of virtual job.

He has built computers and done small computer repairs so I think that could be another avenue.

He loves gaming and I could see him doing streaming. While I know it is a longshot to make any  money from it he has the benefit of time and resources. 

I would be willing to buy any equipment he needed etc. same with other job related endeavors like classes or training. 

Then if that is too much committment or a hassle maybe he could do surveys for money / gift cards. I know it pays very, very little but anything would be better than $0.00.

I hope I have provided sufficient information and am open to any suggestions.

TLDR: How can I help my brother see that he needs to find a way to earn some income? How can I support him? How can I develop a relationship with him?

he’s trying to just survive and it sounds like u guys are forcing a job down his throat. i was in a similar situation only a couple years ago and someone literally applied for a job for me and forced me to go to it. it lead to the lowest point of my life and i honestly barely made it out. i would suggest just trying to make him feel comfortable first and fix his mental before getting him a job. therapy would do wonders more than any job would. what do you want from him? Is it for him to work and contribute or is it for him to become/feel like a better person. if the former, force him into a job and let him hate his life forever, if the ladder, help him work on himself first. people say “you can’t help someone who doesn’t want to help themselves” but that’s false imo all it means is that you didn’t try hard enough or care enough to help them. anyways maybe i just projected in the form of trying to give you advise but anyhow maybe you get something out of this lol. good luck man i hope you guys figure it all out❤️	weelthefignuton	reply	na	na	na	0.9961994290351868	weak	strong	no	na	depression_help
"Hello, im an 18 year old Mexican American boy with (im not saying its true) ADHD who happens to be always thoughtful and curently, ive been sinking into my deepest thoughts constantly and can't help myself but to cry and get angry at those thoughts and the many truths I found myself with.
Why didn't I found out about them before until now?! I'm so fucking stupid

The majority of them is associated with my mom and growing up with her and it's so many things relating to her and my relationship towards her and how she made me grow up into the being I am today! I now blame her from everything that is happening to me by now behind her back! How she treated and treats me! It's a lot and I simply don't know if it's fine explaining everything on a comment!
When I'm down, my mom wants me to talk to her how I feel, as if that bitch even cared, but I don't have enough trust and courage to tell her because ik she doesn't feel the same I do, I expect from her to yell at me and simply leave me there like if she cared, i feel like she acts as if she cares about me and how I feel and why I feel down! Idk but I simply lie my way out of that situation bcs ik she doesn't feel what I feel and won't help me my way out of this situation!

And not only that but I feel like I'm just too inferior for her and that she just sees me as a kid and not like her young adult son that deserves warm over anything material.
I feel like she's like you're bout to be a man grow up but bitch how can I grow up from what I feel
I've never felt her warmth and instead, just scream after scream.
I just want this to end and avoid getting myself killed.
I calm down all of my worries and anxieties and feelings with some alcohol and am I trying my best to not go into taking drugs, I feel like I'm an addict!
I try my best to not even cry or even get angry and make everything explode and going for a kill or even vomit at every thought"	Big_Tackle7565	post	13.149101847676386	female	White	0.02695317007601261	na	na	na	2	depression_help

If she wants to talk to you when you’re feeling down, that right there is a sign that she actually cares. Personally, I would try to empathize with her and see where she’s coming from. Being angry at her and blaming her is not going to fix anything. She isn’t the problem. Try to figure out how conversations with her go wrong, and then do your part to not let it happen again, but also don’t give up on having these necessary conversations with your mom.

This is what I have thought and felt since my early 20’s. Years and years of therapy didn’t get me anywhere since I had no idea the immense amount of damage that childhood physical and emotional abuse from my mother did. That was only exasperated by high functioning (to a stranger) addiction and an emotionally abusive narcissistic ex husband. I’ve allowed myself to stop extinguishing the numerous pan fires and have sat with myself, my crippling depression and anxiety, and the health problems I have endured from surviving stage 3B cancer and the side effects of treatment. It’s been absolutely horrific but also invigorating. I definitely advocate for intensive therapy with the right person but I will also say that if you’re surrounded by toxicity you won’t be able to come out from the flames.

"I feel broken. Psychologically damaged from the emotional pain of feeling alone for most of my life. In the past five years (I'm a 23 and a guy), it feels like it has had its ups and downs with me playing games online and my selfmade purpose was that i wanted to be good at a couple of games and I succeeded but I was very addicted and mentally beating myself up over any mistake I ever made. My friends told me that I should stop so I did. I have wanted to go back to it but I know it's not really an option, just a fantasy, and I shouldn't because it will stunt my growth if I do end up ""making it out."" Some days like today I just feel like I have no hope and there is no reason to continue. I hate everyone in my real life and the only friend I still have is someone I met online 10 years ago. I think about what it would be like to stop existing all the time and not have to suffer through this pain. I essentially fantasize about what it would be like to be dead and be at peace.

"I've had depression for a couple of years now, anxiety, OCD, and low-self esteem my whole life. My parents are emotionally immature at best and abusive at worst. However, I come from a relatively privileged background. I grew up upper middle class. I went to a private school. I currently go to a private college, and will not have any debt. My parents will most likely pay for graduate school. I really have never needed to work a day in my life.

During my sophomore year of college, and AGAIN during my last year, I fell into a depressive episode so long that it led me to fail my classes, almost get suspended, and the second time around is costing me an extra semester of college. I currently have one semester left. Does my privilege have anything to do with my depression? I truly had such an easy life at school, just the classes nothing else. I didn't work a campus job and my parents paid for everything. I feel like a brat for just saying this, to which my father has actually called me a spoiled brat in the last year (for different reasons although). I feel like if I didn't come from such a privileged background, if I knew there wasn't an option of parents paying for an extra semester If I had to work multiple jobs in school just to support myself, I would've gotten my ass together and not failed those classes. This is what my parents tell me at least. I think I believe it now. Granted, I had no idea that I was going to fail the classes in my depressive spiral, and if I did I believe I would've gotten my ass to class and made myself pass. I did have a campus job for a second in fact, and I got fired from it before it even started because I didn't respond to an email fast enough because I was in a depressive episode. Again, if I HAD to work to keep myself afloat maybe I would've responded fast enough. So what I'm asking, is the following: are my depressive episodes just me being a whiny privileged baby? I'm starting to believe they are. My therapists over the years have always praised me for small things. For example, my last semester in school, for the first time in years I went to the majority of my classes and got almost all A's - I think my A+ can make up for the one B+ I got in school lol. I now have an internship this summer. I get so annoyed when I'm praised for these things because why do I deserve sympathy? The people who deserve sympathy for triumphing over depression are those who had no tools in their toolbox, I'm already at an advantage because of the fact that I can afford therapy, etcetera.

My parents also have never cared about me making progress with mental health. Why would they? They directly caused my depression which every therapist I've talked to agrees with. So perhaps that is why I feel this way.

Is this all one big cognitive distortion, or is there any truth to what I'm saying?

In the back of my mind, I feel that I know it is, and I try to remind myself when I'm feeling this way that these strides I've made are absolutely incredible for someone like me, who at a point was not showering for a month and had a plan to jump out my window. However, I feel like I'm lying to myself when I look at my 18-year-old brother, fresh out of high school already has multiple paid internships lined up for next summer and we have the same parents obviously. I feel like, I need to do better and what I'm doing is not good enough. I mean my therapist just praised me for deciding to finish my degree as she said some people would just give up if they couldn't finish in 4 years. I laughed because I thought well that entirely has to do with my privilege not because I'm such a great person because if my parents were not willing to pay an extra semester I wouldn't be able to go and not having a college education is not an option in my family. I'm not special.

"It's okay to be spoiled. Yes, it can make us react more harshly to things further on in life if our expectations are set to being entitled to whatever we want. Your parents may not understand due to their entire generation being unfamiliar with therapy or a good grasp on why other people feel how they do and why. Psychology itself has made leaps in bounds in the past 100 years, we understood almost nothing about it before that (as with most things). Seriously. We're that blessed to be around right now. So without them having many conversations about it, their perspective is just not going to be the same and of course as we get older we're usually less apt to want to learn differently. Gotta forgive them there unfortunately in their ignorance.

We take the cards we're dealt. Money doesn't stop us from having to deal with our emotions of life, it's just a resource. Most people from different backgrounds won't understand your perspective there either unfortunately but that's because you're blessed in that great way right, not a bad tradeoff. Be sure that you're eating well nutrition wise, not overdoing caffeine, and staying active.

"From reading what you wrote, I think maybe you were given everything under the sun (which is ok!), but you didn't get the most important thing from your parents. Which is a nurturing home, understanding, attention, love, support... all of that. If we aren't given that (especially as a child, early years growing up) then it doesn't matter how much privilege or money you have access to. I've been reading a lot lately on all type of mental illness and behaviors- and what it all seems to come back to is that everyone is a product of their past traumas. It's your inner child in there that's longing for something they didn't get (love and compassion from parents maybe??). So you could be sitting on a billion dollars and still wouldn't feel ""content"" until you work out those inner child past traumas. P.S. this is my very first comment on reddit. I'm so worried about telling someone what they already know or accidentally saying something offensive. I hope you didn't get that vibe!! I was just sharing my thoughts based on knowing people from a similar story as you and from LOTS of reading. 😊"	serenity_now_23	reply	na	na	na	0.007266842760145664	weak	no	no	na	depression_help
"hey all.  

i'm in a bit of a tough spot. the long story short for reference, i'm 40, female, married to my wife for almost 3 years now. (we've known each other for 10-11 years)

i work in a daycare/nursery/kindergarden thing (i'm not a native speaker and i really don't know which is the proper word, but, kids 0-3 in my group, with kids 3-6 in other groups)  
we have mixed groups of children with and without disabilities, and i LOVE my work with all my heart

been diagnosed with anxiety at 14, depression at 16 and OCD at 19ish, i've also been later on diagnosed with ADHD in my mid-20ies (i think it was around 26) been in and out of therapy a couple times, twice in a all-day hospital institution (as in, i went there by choice for therapy for 8 and 10 weeks respectively) 

in my last stationary stay, one of my therapists said he suspects i have trauma in my past and am now dealing with PTSD symptoms. back then (i think it was around 2018), i denied it, and vehemently so. i wasn't very open to the idea, because i've no memories of ever being abused (in either way), neglected or otherwise mistreated. i thought (and still do!) that i grew up in a loving home and haven't experienced anything ""bad enough"" to cause something like trauma. 

years later, a lot of researching/reading into things, and 6 months into a qualification course to become a trauma counsellor (ironic, i know.) i am now with a new therapist, and she's been like an epiphany personified. within a few sessions, she's managed to explain me to myself in ways i've never experienced. 

things i've never consciously recognized about myself, and that no therapist before has ever seen, or mentioned to me before. she made me realize just how badly i think about myself. how harsh i treat myself and how much i bend over backwards to please the people around me and how little i allow myself to ""be a burden"". 

and here's the issue with that. i don't know if i'm now just really really f\*cking aware of how much i dislike myself, or if i've gotten worse with it.   
i had a breakdown about two months ago, where i finally was able to voice my grievings about my married life, and changes that i'm not ready for, to a friend of ours, and since then, i've been crying so much. 

i know it's probably a good thing (my therapist praised me for finally allowing myself to \*feel\* things, and allow myself to cry, after literally crying, like, twice in the last 5 years. i'm very good at not having deep feelings) and i've been really sore and sensitive since then. i keep going down mental spirals with self-depreciating thoughts, about how i'm too much and not enough, ever, for anyone and how it's no wonder my wife (who has asperger's) can't stand to be so close around me (we're planning on moving into either a bigger house, or two separate places, because she can't stand being around people, me included, for long times. it worked for a while, but now she's nearing her limit)

and, logically, if i think clearly, i am very aware it's not \*me\*, it's circumstances and our mental illnesses clashing, we don't want to separate and we are supportive and caring with each other. but i take \*everything\* very personally, every little word, every change of tone, sends me off into what i've now learned is very reminiscent of a fawn response. i shut myself in my room, spending my time being quiet and hating myself for existing in her space. 

there's thoughts about my early home life and how i was a very wanted baby, after my mom had a miscarriage, and when i arrived i wasn't a normal baby, i was a typical ADHD baby, didn't want to nurse, screamed a lot, didn't tolerate physical contact very well, and my parents did their fucking best, never knowing i had an issue, because 40 years ago, ADHD wasn't a thing. 

i struggle so hard with guilt, about everything and anything and these last weeks, it's just been skyrocketing and becoming so much worse and i know it may be signs of healing but i'm scared it's just... getting worse. 

i have another appointment with my therapist next week, and i ALSO feel guilty for having to tell her i'm getting worse, when i just told her, at the last appointment, things were going well (which they had been, the week leading up to that.)

i just don't know how to handle all this.

&#x200B;

(just to make sure, i'd like to add that i'm not in danger. i'm not having fantasies or plans of harming myself. the thoughts do come, and sometimes i wish i'd get caught in an accident to get injured, but i am not actively doing or thinking of any of that. if bad came to worse, i have very dear colleagues with whom i'm close, and i know where i could turn to)"	blackiedwaggie	post	37.03868606689133	female	White	0.0015979033196344972	na	na	na	4	depression_help

I've lived I the same residency for about 7 years with my current roommate.  About 2 years into my stay, his behaviors seem to have changed. We used to watch TV together, football ect. And he minded his own business.  Now he seems to make it a point to lay in his bed, with his door open, in silence, all day and only gets up in the morning  after i've have woken him up by making breakfast or getting ready for the day. Then he'll change his entire schedule around when i do anything. He tries to always cook dinner the same time i do, go's to bed the same time I do, all because he literally sits there 5 feet away from me and listens to when I do anything. He even asked me when I was working nights, what time I would be home, just so he can stay up til 5am til the moment I came home before he would go to bed himself. I told him, it shouldn't matter what time I come home, it's random, I don't have a predetermined little schedule, stop stting in your room all day waiting for me to come home and listening to everything I do and it won't be a fucking problem! It makes me extremely irritated and I've confronted him about it and asked him if it was intentional, and why he can't just mind his own business and that i notice it and it makes me feel uncomfortable.  And he told me that hes not aware he does it with a weird smirk on his face and i kind of called him an autistic F word and lashed out at him a few times, told him it's weird and that he doesn't have to vicariously sit and godamn listen to everything I do.  Which caused him to stop doing it for a while but i regret doing, because now when he's doing it, he knows it gets to me. So now he's resided entirely to gis room all day and sits and waits and listens for when I come home.   Im so frustrated at him! I feel like I have no privacy and can't do anything without this person knowing, or it effecting him in some way. How do I deal with this?

Just one important piece of advice, always be honest. The first time I went to therapy I was 17 and I lied so much because I was scared, be honest and thorough.

Do what they told you to do. If they prescribe medication, take them. Progress can take some time. Dont give up right in the middle of it.

"Don't ever be afraid to ""shop around!"" Therapists want you to be comfortable, so if you see one for a while or even just once it's okay to decide to switch to a new one! 

I was forced to stop seeing my therapist as a teenager cause my family didn't like that I was telling him stuff about them. I was afraid to look for a new one when I became an adult. After some research about therapists in my area, I found my current one and I am very happy to talk and work with her. :)"	Lexis_medows	reply	na	na	na	0.0042806449346244335	weak	strong	no	na	depression_help
"Haven't left my flat in atleast a month other than hospital trips.

Get everything delivered now, can't stand the thought of going outside. Ever since I lost my best friend I'm terrified I'll see her If I go out. We don't even live in the same town. I haven't been to work because of that, she likes the city alot so there's a chance I actually might see her. I can't even go into town for drinks, she goes all the place I did.

I need to walk to the shop tomorrow morning and I just can't. I'll have too, but I'm probably just going to keep putting it off even though I literally have no food left and a £10 in cash to last the next week. I have no motivation to do anything whatever, I don't think I've moved from this couch all day other than too smoke out the window.

"I am an 18 year old male, I am coming here because I genuinely have no one else to talk to about this or feel like no one will really understand, so I took it to a bunch of strangers on Reddit. I have been struggling In my life for as long as I can remember honestly, growing up I guess I never realized that there was always a bunch of stuff going on around me or to me, for example when I was a kid around 5 I don’t remember my exact age, I was sexually assaulted by my older sister who eventually had died from suicide just a while later, growing up I kinda put the sexual assault aside because I never realized it was a big deal till I grew older, and as well as her passing because I just I didn’t know how to process at such a young age I think, and that leaves me at a weird spot, how can I decide how to feel about my older sister knowing she has done that to me but also knowing she was my sister and I loved her and she passed away. How do I feel about that? I don’t know how to feel about it, so I leave it alone. 


Now my biggest issue is my mental health, every day feels like it’s just going by, and I’m not even here to catch them, for the past year all I have done is bought weed and worked to by more weed, I see this as a problem obviously but can’t stop, I try to discipline myself but keep falling back into old habbits, I have seen no progression in my life or in my mental health that it’s getting very unmotivating and leaves me to wonder if I will ever get out of this. 

I believe I do have bad mental health issues and but do nothing to fix them, I spiral in my thoughts, I always think someone’s out to get me, I always think it’s gonna be my last day alive because I feel my health decline, I barely take care of myself anymore and I hate to admit it, I feel like I constantly change the person I am, one week I feel changed, energetic, ready to take shit on, another week I just want to lay down all day and sleep, I lost my job the other because I didn’t even wanna wake up. I left this here because I don’t know who to talk to tell about this because I don’t think I’ve ever received closure or any type of support in these events or just in life in general, and I’m not asking for it either, I just feel like I need to be heard."	imnotdelulu	post	32.686606251353375	female	White	0.9968008995056152	na	na	na	2	depression_help

Lately, I've been feeling absolutely AWFUL. I have this SEVERE feeling of grief for NO REASON. It's excruciating and I don't know where it's coming from or how to make it go away because I don't know what's wrong. Then, there's guilt for feeling this way because I know I have everything to make me happy. I shouldn't feel this way, I should be happy! * I do have depression and anxiety(anxiety since 1996, depression since maybe 1998?)... I'm on Effexor, and in years past, I've tried to make myself better by trying MANY other medications... which was an absolute SHIT SHOW. Nothing else worked and I ended up being a nasty asshole instead of getting better. Every. Single. Time. (Effexor is the only thing that kind-of works). I've wasted years of my life and my 11 year old probably thinks I'm just a worthless nut case. A tired nutcase. I've had chronic fatigue since was 26 (15 years now) when the doctors take blood, everything is seemingly fine (except for about 3 instances of mono). Thyroid is fine, blood is fine. Nothing is wrong, they send me away. So, not only am I a mess mentally, but I can't keep up physically as well. I don't want to live like this anymore. I need to know what's wrong. I don't know who to ask. Is there anyone I can go to to help me? I also have adhd-inattentive. <~ I don't look sick, I'm not overweight.

"Man I am in the same boat as you. CFS and doctors saying it's all fine also. Same with the grief and the meds. Effexor gave me brain shocks and made me angry. The ONLY ssri/snri/antipsychotic/anything that they ever gave me that helped was Prozac. Even then it would only work for a while and it would get bumped up and bumped up and bumped up until it maxed out. I was on so many other things though.. each out of the several times I was put on it. I'm on the lowest dose now though and it helps, but I think that's only because I've been getting sprovato infusions. The esketamine nasal spray. Have you ever tried that? Are you able to? I know there is an Rx drug which contains DXM and something else (wellbutrin maybe? Idk that stuff make me an emotional wreck crying all of the time) which may be cheaper/easier to access. Dxm being a dissasociate anaesthetic like ketamine may help? Id read about it first.


I've never been very good with advise. DO you know if you've had your c reactive protein tested before in any blood work? That's the only thing that ever shows up abnormal for me, but it indicates an inflammatory problem.. and that's indicative of either an autoimmune issue or a cycle of stress which builds and causes more and more symptoms that are difficult to pinpoint. Right now I'm being told I have every symptom of lupus.. but not lupus..it's inflammation due to severe stress Lol. Maybe you can look into getting that identified. At least you'd have more of something to kinda look at. But I hope you know you're at least not alone. You're not going crazy or anything and don't think like the world is against you.

I tried to post this on suicide watch, but I got banned immediately, the saftey nets I used to rely on have disolved, and I'm clinging to threads so I really hope it fits here.

So I'm 27  and have always felt like dying since I was a kid. Sometimes it's  intrusive, sometimes it's passive, this time it's pretty intentional and  calculated. I've got everything ready to go, I have my means, the  place, the playlist, I wrote a lil will, i became an organ donor, put  the bills in my housemates names and tonight I finished writing to  everyone I love and that I wanted to say goodbye to. I confessed a  couple of secret crushes and in general I hope I told them thing that  will make them smile so it doesn't hurt too much.

I  saw a psychologist and told her what I was thinking, but I'm a mental  health nurse so I'm pretty good at dodging getting sectioned... she  asked me about saftey nets and the ones that kept me safe up till now  have disintegrated.

I ummm I love  my ex, and things got fucked up, ldr and my mental health kinda killed  it... and honestly it's hard to follow my advice and find little reasons  to stay, so here I am, my last saftey net is strangers on reddit.

Well what I can say is. If you really want that change you can do it. You have the power to make the changes. You just have to look at yourself in the mirror and want that change and go get it. I understand your pain. I was a football play who worked so hard to ear a college football scholar ship. I fought so hard to earn it and when I went to college to play I achieved it and started but in a matter of minutes I lost it all. I blew out my knee and couldn’t play for the whole season and lost my scholar ship. I was depressed and didn’t know what to do with myself everything I worked so hard for gone. I had to come back home and work. I lost it all and was in a black hole. But I took a look at myself in the mirror and was disgusted with myself and I wanted to change and go get out of this put I was in. And I did you just gotta dig deep and believe in your self and when it’s get hard you gotta keep going so you can achieve that greatness you want	Baticula	reply	na	na	na	0.9994077682495117	weak	strong	no	na	depression_help
How did you come to understand that your symptoms were the result of depression and not some other underlying condition?  I’ve been dealing with health issues for the last few years, some of them caused by an iron deficiency that took far too long to diagnose and treat. But, now as my iron has improved, I am feeling more fatigued, sad, lacking motivation and anxious. Is it possible depression is to blame for many of these symptoms?  My pcp has given me an rx for Wellbutrin and propanolol, but I can’t shake the feeling that something else is wrong with me to have me feeling so unlike myself.

I am in no way an expert but it does sound likely. My depression was also the result of a medical issue (lost half my skull in a car accident). Well I'm not sure if that's correct but it comes from everything my car accident brought to my life? So it ultimately all comes from that. I do think it's more the effect it has on your life rather than what actually happens in the illness/accident? But as I say I'm no expert on the matter can just give my experience.

"Hey, thanks for even stopping in. I'm really in need of emotional support and advice.

To cut right to the chase: I think our world is completely fucked and I wish somebody would start a revolution that I could join. I'd rather put my energy into that than pretty much anything else at this point. American BTW.

I'm not so depressed that I can't bring myself to go for hikes or do other things I love, it's just so soul-crushing returning to my ""reality."" It takes a lot of effort to get myself out into the woods, and as soon as it's time to come back into the world, the hopelessness just rushes back in.

I just can't understand why we're all made to live this way. I was just reading about the North Ponds Hermit - yes he was a thief, no bueno, but they FORCED him back into this society against his will. It just seems like there's no escape.

I was fired from the best job I've ever had about 2 months ago (35m btw). The work I was doing was so fulfilling and truly put my passions to use - but the admin was horrendous and barely supported us. It came to a head and I was let go without any chance at closure with my colleagues or clients.

Now I'm stuck in a town where I have no connections - I moved here a few years ago due to a job I had taken while in a relationship. Small town, burned bridges with ex and all her friends. So I basically have agoraphobia - I stay in my depressing apt, or go out of town into the woods.

I need to move, but I have no money, about $10k in dumbass debt that I can't seem to shake, and don't even know where I want to go or what I'd want to do. I did try moving out of state last summer, but my potential roommate turned out to be quite toxic himself. I came back to my apt and ended up finding a good job, now I'm feeling stuck here again. Like I need to get another job in town just to afford to move out of town. My best option seems like selling anything I own and being the next Hermit.

If you've made it this far, thank you just for reading. I'm sorry this turned into a sort of chaotic rant. I have a ton of passions, and love humans. I hate seeing us all be crushed by our worlds wealth addiction. ANY words of support would be hugely appreciated - and if you have any ideas for me, even way outside the box, I'd love that too.

If you do wanna offer advice/ideas, this might be helpful: I have a BA in psychology, 200-hr yoga teacher credentials with no teaching experience. And that's about it. No real desire/funds to go back to school - education esp in America just gets my cynical blood boiling. I have 1 yr experience in public education, 4 yrs in human services (cps casework and direct support), 5+ in kitchen work (chef, cook, beer only bartending, some serving), and distant experience in credit union customer service. Just wanted to give some ideas in case anyone wanted to make suggestions. Thank you.


TLDR: I'm sick of our sick society weighing myself and everyone around me down, and I don't know what to do. I'm broke, in debt, starting to miss payments, and feeling stuck in a town which carries a lot of toxic feelings for me. Any support/advice is very appreciated. Love you."

You're very good at expressing what you're going through and it sounds like allot, I'm sorry I don't really have any useful advice, allot of your stuff sounds like it needs practical solutions.
On the note of revolution I think I'm waiting for a big ol war to start so I can be a medic and save lives while getting shot at.
It'd make me feel useful and possibly wouldn't have to worry about suicide anymore... until the ptsd sets in.

"Alright...so has i've said a million times after my ex broke up with me i fell into the pit of depression, and just when i tought i was out, all the friends i had and trusted so much stabbed me in the back and left.
There hasn't been a day in wich i did not think abou her.
There hasn't been a day since i've been dangerous things,
But today i reached the peak, i did a horrible thing (that i wont mention) that could destroy my life and i'm in a spiral of anxiety right now, i don't know how many cigarettes i've smoked today after what i did, i don't know how many seconds i've counted since i did it.
Everyone left, my family calls me useless, there is no one around, i'm in the pure loneliness right now, living day by day in this stupid city, and i keep regretting my actions day by day.
I'm at rock bottom, i don't even have the energy to stand up, i did it so many times.
 everyone has been telling me about the light at the end of the tunnel, but i grasped for so long on that idea that i didn't realize there was no light.
This is my call for help, i'm tired people, and i'm alone.
I beg to someone, to reach out, to be my friend, please, i can't go on like this, i just want friends again, i just want to be loved."	samzdrawz	post	27.376407693453945	female	White	0.9938609600067139	na	na	na	6	depression_help

Its important to learn from our mistake. As long as you understand that what you did was wrong, you are on the right path.

I suffered from depression for more than 10 years. I had two very weird psychosis. Alchool abuse, drug abuse. I found the light at the end of the tunnel. Took some times. Had to work on myself.

"No, no one was hurt, the only thing that could be in danger here is my private life.

Yes, during my whole life i had to talk to various therapists but it all resulted in me knowing my problems and people having unexpected reactions to my pain.
For all my life i've been taken as a joke, and i was capable of seeing that just when everyone laughed at me because i was struggling to get over my ex

I gave my whole life for that woman and she got away in a matter of days, never appeared again.
I never talked bad about her, never called her slurs because i understand personal choiches, but i've been left here to rot, while in a matter of days she was living her best life sorrounded by friends and quite surely a new man
I felt like a prop, something that lasted until she had to go away for university.
How do you get up on your feet when the only woman you loved, the woman you dreamed a whole life together, disappears?
I'm suffering a lot everyday, it looks more like i'm pretending to be ok,
And the thing is that i had to block her not for anger, not for hate, but because after she disappeared every time i looked even just at her name i would freeze up, and one day i did the grave mistake to look at her instagram profile and something burned deep inside my chest, i felt a pain that i never felt before, i still remember the precise instants, i was about to cry in a bus full of people, but i got so used to suppressing emotions that they don't even show anymore, and it makes me suffer so much, going through therapists made me feel like a guinea pig, they shaped me into a sensless monster that doesn't care about anything but pretends to do so, and vice versa.
I'm an artist, and even my drawings since last year have been locked on drawing her face over and over again, it feels like my brain wont give up on anything, i can't forget even the little details, i still remember all the physical and emotional abuses from my family, all the blood i dropped, all the bullying i received, and i wonder if i'm walking on the razor's edge of becoming a psychopath by now."	samzdrawz	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9938609600067139	no	strong	no	na	depression_help
"Ok so you have a lot of wounds. Those need to heal. First your break up and that abuse from your family and bullying. Wounds take times to heal but they will, one day. You just have to let time pass. One day this will be behind you. Think about 10 years from now. Do you really think that you would still feel this way for her? If not 10 years, than 20 years from now. This is how, as you said, you will be able to get on your feet again even after she disapeared. Time will pass, it is a fact, time always pass. Right now you might not understand it. But you need to understand that, right now, you are blinded by your emotions. You cant see pass them. Remember that the future exist. It will come and, with it, you will heal. It is unavoidable.

As you can see sometimes i just get the force to stand up, but that is fueled only by my general hate towards anyone...see?

"So about two months ago I had a really unfortunate situation. I had recently gotten a new job, I wasn't a fan of the job so I took it and kept looking. I eventually had an interview for a much better position. That position sent me a letter of offer, once I received that I naturally put my two weeks in at the position I had, however, once I has put my two weeks in the letter of offer was rescinded. I tried to retract my two weeks however the company I was working for had hired to fill the slot I left. 

So here I am having lost two jobs in one go. Since then I have been unemployed and honestly I had my life starting to fall into place before this happened, I could afford to see a psychologist, I could afford the medication I need, I had money to save for my first home and to buy a ring to propose to my partner. 

Since then I have had no luck with work, I have applied for roughly 100-150 jobs a week and have heard back from very few jobs. I'm out of money, I can't afford my medication, I am putting my social life on hold, I haven't seen my psychologist is nearly three months, proposing to my partner seems years away now and moving out feels like a pipe dream. I'm tired of having no luck, I'm in severe need of help with my mental state. The backwards step I've taken is killing me, the thing is my resume isn't bad. I've held multiple leadership positions, have been the Executive Producer of multiple radio shows over the last three years. I'm applying for just about everything and not hearing back. It feels like I am useless and I'm worth nothing. I'm losing it honestly, I don't want to be unemployed, I don't want to feel like this, I don't want people to tell me off because I can't find work. I'm hurting badly, I've had to put years of planning and dreams on the back burner, I'm stress eating, I'm taking half dosages of my medication, I'm falling into a slump, I can't afford to go see my friends, I can't afford to take my partner out. I feel like shit. I feel like I'm falling continuously and don't know why. I'm trying to pick myself up but I genuinely don't know how to anymore.

I can understand how you're feeling, finding work can be really hard these days, try not to be too hard on yourself. I'm not sure where you're from but you could try talking to your doctor they might have some kind of assistance for medications. I would also suggest that you look around for some free groups in your area, I have never been able to afford therapy so I have been putting my name on all lists around my area, the wait can be kind of long so I also use youtube to find exercises that I can do on my own, positive self talk and guided meditation has helped me a lot over the years. As far as proposing to your partner, I know you want to get them a ring you feel they deserve, but keep in mind that if they really love you any ring you propose with they will love, trust me, and you don't have to take them out to fancy places, make a few sandwiches and go for a walk somewhere and have a picnic, or make dinner for them, it shows that you care and want to make them happy, I know I would love it if my husband made me a picnic and took me out for a walk even if its just somewhere close to home. I have been battling depression for over 20 years now, I know how hard it can get and how over eating can affect your life and health, I know how hopeless it can feel at times, it can feel so lonely when you are at the low points. Please give the positive self talk a try, it might take a few weeks before you start to believe what you're saying, it can be hard to repeat things that you don't believe about yourself, it took a long time for me to repeat the phrases without crying but it was worth it, I still have a lot of work to do on myself but when I look back to where I use to be I am so proud of myself for making it this far. I'm just a stranger on the internet and I don't know you but just know that somewhere there is someone who believes in you, you are stronger than you think and I know that one day you will look back on this time and be proud of yourself.

"I have been married over 20 years, kids, etc...  My relationship with my wife is, well let's call it strained.  I have battled depression for a long time, and recently, in the past month or so I was brave enough to share that with my wife, after a really bad fight....  Her response was, ""yeah, I know, I can tell.  It's been long enough and effecting the family, what are you going to do about it?  I've (speaking of herself) dealt with it we all do"" and then proceeds to tell me all she's done.  She wants me to make a plan, write it out, and follow it, to show her I'm faithful and will do what I say.   That only thought in my head is WTF?!?!?!?  She gets on me when I'm quiet, complains that I don't talk much, or not ber engaging to the family.  I feel my entire life is a freaking act to keep her off my back.  She acts loving for a handful of days, and then BOOOOM, she's had enough giving and I'm doing doing this that and the other.  I have always had low self esteem, never thought of myself as good enough in AMYTHING, and all the time she gets on me, which is often, is killing me.  And it's my fault I just need to do.  Her famous words, Boss up and be a man.  She then compares me to my udalt children to look at them and what they do...  She can't be belittling enough, and keeps going.  And then she thinks, a oh I am sorry for the horrible things I just said and names I called you, I don't think that, love me.  Things calm, and then a week or two go by and then BAM, again.

I can not get out of this spiral in my head.  I have been like a zombie for months, and can't break out of this thought pattern.  I don't know if I can see myself as anything other than a complete failure as a husband, father, and a man.  I am not your big strong burly men.  I'm small framed, quiet, shy, emotional, etc...  I really think she ""loves"" me for what she thinks I could be, but NOT the man I am....  I have thought about ending myself, it's a fantasy that lives in my head continuously, for as long as I know, but I don't ever see me acting on it, I just need to know there is an end at some point to the anxiety and pain I feel daily.  I agree putting on a show when I get home from work, but without a good show, I get another lecture, turn fight, telling me all the ways I've failed, and what I should be doing.... Anyway, sorry for the rant, my heart literally hurts, and I want to be loved for who and what I am, maybe that doesn't exist for a man like me, then I would rather be alone and live under a bridge than the pain I feel daily...."

Now for your wife, everyone react differently infront of tragedy. Maybe this is her way to rationalize it to herself.

You're not going to want to hear this man, but you're in a toxic relationship as the kids say. At this point in life you've got to make a hard and terrible decision. She won't change, I don't think people like that really can. Mine left me for another man, it was easy for me to justify it to myself. I was gone frequently (military), depressed, borderline alcoholic. I had a temper as well, so it made sense that she left. It wasn't until she left that I realized I needed the help to change and get better. It's been 5 years now and I'm still recovering. I'm better now but the biggest takeaway is that I didn't see it for what it was. A bad relationship, and that's not good for either party, especially the kids. Do what you think is right, but you have to be aware of what the situation is and what you can tolerate.	LostWanderer2021	reply	na	na	na	0.9991337656974792	weak	strong	no	na	depression_help
"Part 1 Okay, so one point after another. There absolutely are solutions to your situation and you absolutely don't need to feel this way all the time. I wonder only if those solutions wouldn't seem too drastic to you. It's very clear what's anchoring you in the depression is actually a deep sense of responsibility towards your family and the role you're supposed to fulfill in society. I would wager this is the source of your depression, the feeling that you're not meeting those standards.

As for your wife, I am an asshole - I recognize this behavior. I can imagine myself acting like this. I would hate myself for it, but wouldn't be able to stop. Let's not pretend - women carry a lot of household chores and house organization and it sounds like this wife also carries emotional responsibility for entire household because you've been checked out. It's not your fault, but there is so much on her, she goes into super toxic solution you described - arguing, cycle, trying, telling you you've failed... On one hand I fully get her - running a household emotionally by yourself is not okay. Depression or not, you signed up for the marriage and depression makes you unavailable. But at the same time, what she does is not helping at all, she is only contributing to your pain and her anger maybe allows her to throw her frustration back to the source of it (you) so it's short term stress relief, but it doesn't work full time to solve the issues.

I don't think this marriage is savable. And I don't think your status quo is savable. 

At this point your depression has pointed you in the right direction - listen to it. If it got so bad you're thinking about suicide and that being alone under the bridge would be better, it's time to go. Listen, from what you described it sounds like your presence is not helping. It's not contributing. You should leave. For both of you. This isn't even about your feelings, but her feelings - if she was to be left alone with the responsibilities she has, this would allow her to overhaul her entire processing and attitude. All those problems she is experiencing - she would still be experiencing them, but now she has PROOF she has to carry it alone. When you're there, supposed to help, but can't, it's just frustrating. I am just being practical here first. I am not advocating that you focus on only practical realities - your depression absolutely needs to be professionally adressed, but I think this is just something that should be done first, for both of you. I had the issue with my partner being not available due to depression and I remember how we split and how all the problems I had suddenly became easier. I still had the same amount of tasks as before, no - I had more. But somehow it was easier without him. Him constantly letting me down in his inability to contribute something - emotional processing, communication - just him constantly emanating how defeated, resigned and hopeless he feels, this made me feel only rage towards him. 

And reality is that you need that just as much as she does. 

You absolutely deserve to be loved for who you are. You are utterly incorrect in your assumptions that being small and shy makes you somehow less valuable than the strong burly guy. Dude, that's not how this works. You can be small and shy and defeated and still thousand times better than a thousand burly guys. You absolutely can and should be loved for who you are. But you are not. At the moment, you're not. And this is not healthy.

Here's where things go different than my story: I was full of rage towards my depressed partner. We spoke, we made plans, wrote them down, I pointed shit out to him, yelled, broke down, he didn't better anything, cycle continued, I tried to be patient, but only could fake it, so my rage accelerated, here we go again. We didn't have children, but still had responsibilities and problems of running a household due to money problems and my illness.

Here's what I didn't do.

I didn't compare him to anyone. And when I did- I did so favourably. But without lying.

His depression? Stemmed from the absolute reality of discrimination he experienced. His feeling he failed? Stemmed from high standards he had for himself. His feeling he was worth nothing? He compared himself to his bosses, who reasonably earned ten times his wage, but also he could cite plenty moments when they didn't actually know shit. His depression was absolutely rooted in reality. I could this mental exercise of connect the dots - I could make links between what was happening in our and his life and his depression. And I knew he isn't depressed to hurt me and I am not the one that got the raw deal. I knew he felt he failed himself, wasn't good enough, smart enough, strong enough, resilient enough, cunning enough. His depression wasn't a reflection of his failure, but his high ground. He was depressed because he legitimately expected more of himself - and secondly, because the world turned out so much crueler than we ever anticipated. I couldn't fault him for his response. Mine wasn't so depressed, but I can't expect him to think and feel like me.

So here's the deal.

I understand your wife's feelings - to some extent.

But she is abusing you.

I don't care how many things you let her down in. I don't care if you failed to bring money to the table. I don't care if you let her down time after time.

You're not doing this to hurt her. This is what should be obvious to her as your partner - that there is no malicious intent here. And this matters a whole lot, because what kind of person holds against their partner something they're not doing maliciously and are themselves helpless against? If she has zero empathy for you, she isn't good enough to be your wife. That's how this works. That's how relationships are supposed to work.

You keep thinking about how you failed her but you never see that she failed you. If she became depressed, the world would have expected you, reasonably so, to be empathetic and support her, not lose your shit and patience eventually. Because this is how relationships are supposed to work. You tried to communicate, you tried to better yourself and you lost. She is not the one who got the raw deal here - you are. You're the one that is depressed. And yeah it matters a whole lot because you cannot judge your partner negatively for things they do to hurt you if everything that you receive from them went through them first. And this is what happens in depression. Whatever you gave her emotionally, went through you first. She gets only the residue and consequences, you have the whole experience. She is not the victim here.

Comparing you to your adult children and their accomplishments is sick, wrong and abusive. Let's apply the same standard then. If she is capable of noticing that you're not up to the standards she has for you and you also admit you're screwing things up/not doing what you should be delivering - where is her actual unpretended empathy? Where is her actual support?

She is entitled to this rage. But she should have a lot more emotions than that. Rage at you should be at the bottom of the list and definietely behind rage she feels at depression that targeted you. She should feel outraged on your behalf depression dared to target you and hurt you, the man she married and gave children to. I don't care what your relationship has started like or been like before. Now is now. And now she has failed you.

And you're entitled to leave. 

*"" She wants me to make a plan,* ***write it out, and follow it, to show her I'm faithful and will do what I say. That only thought in my head is WTF?!?!?!?*** *She gets on me when I'm quiet, complains that I don't talk much, or not ber engaging to the family. I feel my entire life is a freaking act to keep her off my back.* ***She wants me to make a plan, write it out, and follow it, to show her I'm faithful and will do what I say.***  *.""*

You mean what she said. She is not trying to even help you. When dealing with a depressed person, you have to leave them room to do things their own way, there is no way around it. Your wife is acting like you're a puppet whose strings she is holding - she is moving them and you're supposed to move accordingly. But the depression messes everything up - she is moving correct strings and doesn't get a correct response, the puppet's broken. 

Fuck your wife. 

She is not even trying to help you."	LostWanderer2021	reply	na	na	na	0.9991337656974792	weak	no	no	na	depression_help
"Part 2 

Here's the deal. We made written plans and explanations. He still has some of those papers today. And I felt pain when he forgot the explanations, when he repeated his mistakes. But I never acted like your wife did. Do you know why? Because I legitimately gave a fuck about him. Because what mattered wasn't that house was messy or money low or rent unpaid or what neighbors or bosses think - what mattered was him.

Now I will tell you the best part.

I have a physical disability, my family rejected me, he was my ex boyfriend and decided to help me and take care of me to the best of his abilities, I would do my best, we would live together.

We weren't a couple.

We didn't have children or at the time, a cat. We just run a household together and were ""in it"" together. We were not romantically connected or sexually connected and at the time, he lost ability to feel any connection to any living being. And this isn't about me - it's about the fact that how your wife has acted towards you is unforgivable. She is entitled to anger, frustration and even to you admitting you fucked up and this is how much you didn't deliver when it comes to the household/money. But she is not entitled to behavior you described, not in any way, shape or form. She has shown zero care. She is what is sustaining your depression.

It is not your responsibility to appease her moods or her perceptions to ""keep her off your back"". She has a responsibility to consider your point of view. **She may disagree with it - but she doesn't get to override the validity of it completely.** Even if you were psychotic and saw things that weren't there, she would still have a responsibility to acknowledge that maybe you see shit that isn't there, but 1)you don't do it maliciously 2)you legitimately think it's there, your eyes saw it, how are you supposed to know it's not really there, you're fucking psychotic? This is the illustration - even if you saw shit that isn't there she HAS TO acknowledge the way you're perceiving these things. That you're not trying to mess up her life or hurt her on purpose. She failed at that spectacularly and she proceeded to process those problems by abusing you instead of supporting you. 

Even if you would have completely messed up, stopped making any money, didn't contribute to household, made debts she had to pay off - she still isn't entitled to acting like you're her puppet. Even if you were addicted to drugs and stealing from the house, this still wouldn't justify how she responded. She didn't write the notes to help you navigate or remember. She wrote you instructions who you are supposed to be, what behaviors you're supposed to imitate. And if you're not imitating them - you're not faithful.

Bitch please. 

This is my take on the situation. This is what I ""felt"" on emotional level while reading your words. I absolutely may be wrong on one or all points I made. This is just my sense of it. I may be wrong in my assessment of your situation, your wife or you, but the points I made still stand - please consider them. Please look at this from point of view not what she is entitled to in this situation, but what you are entitled to in this situation. Depression may have removed your ability to feel you deserve anything, but fact is you're entitled - not deserving, but entitled - to being considered with consideration. Simple. You're entitled to her making decisions after she processed the fact 

**1)she is not the victim here** 

**2)you're not malicious** 

**3)this isn't about her, not really** 

**4)your husband matters more than the physical state of your household and his mental health matter more than appearances**  

I hope this helps somewhat. Remember, this was written by someone who was utterly and endlessly frustrated with their partner's (household partner, we run the house together) depression and its effects -  all this with his depression putting us in danger of being homeless, me with being physically disabled and ill and in constant pain - and I still acknowledged reality that his depression hurts him much more than my illness hurts me. Those were just the raw facts - at the end of the day, he was at the time, broken down to nothing by his depression. I was angry, but not dying on the inside. So I was not the victim and despite my state I was not the one who deserved focus and attention and empathy. And I wasn't even able to give him emotional support he deserved from me. I was too preoccupied with my own shit. But I still wasn't too preoccupied to do for him three things.

1) make it known I understand he is the victim here and he isn't doing any of this to upset me or scare me, and his issues with earning money and us having apartment problems had a huge impact on me as I was dependent upon him - and still that didn't give me the right to boss him around and order him to shake depression off or something like that

2) make it known he deserves, he is entitled to real support I cannot give him and it's vital he gets it from somewhere. Thus we will find the money for even cheapest online therapist, or free therapy from our medical system or anything or strangers who will talk to him, anyone, anything - he may not be receiving the support, but the support he SHOULD be receiving, is immense

3) make it known that shit can be falling apart, as long as he communicates, he is in the clear. that's it. If he can't do something and can't say he won't do it to avoid upsetting me, he can tell me after the fact ""Yeah I couldn't, I am sorry"" and that was it. He was in the clear. It was obvious the did his best literally. If he didn't do something, it meant he couldn't. As long as he acknowledged, as long as line of communication was open, he was in the clear. All things that would normally count as ""sins"" as not making enough money, or not even being able to go to work, anything - all those were offset. As long as he communicated about his inability to communicate or process, even post factum - he was in the clear.

This was the only thing I could do for him. I failed him - what I should've done was be the emotional support. But this illness, this constant pain, my own loneliness and problems... ate into my ability to be that. So I had to improvise. And this is how I improvised. I kept reminding him that just because I am not emotionally his rock that doesn't mean he isn't entitled to one. 

I am telling you this so you see how much can be done even in dire circumstances, when empathy is lacking and problems abound. If you just care, if you just acknowledge the issue, this is the kind of attitude you can have. Not ordering the other person around to do and be what you said. That is more than wrong, it's evil, it's abusive. 

I hope this gives you some perspective and helps a little."	LostWanderer2021	reply	na	na	na	0.9991337656974792	no	strong	no	na	depression_help
"Therapy. You need therapy. For yourself. And possibly medication. 

You’d both likely benefit from couples therapy in learning how to communicate together. You to open up to her properly before crisis point. Her to not react to crisis point and to pick at you about why she’s upset. 

Your wife sounds burned out. How much slack has she been picking up while you’ve been unwell? How often have you thanked her?

I’m not saying what she’s said is justified. But I’ve been in both situations and sometimes you are just *done* and if she’s known you’ve been this way for a while and you’ve been closed off to her… she is probably upset you’ve not taken steps to get better to be an equal in the relationship.

I am not comfortable around anyone, even at home, except with my little kids.  I don't have a hobby, nothing I do that I enjoy, I don't look forward anything...

Whenever I feel down and really suicidal, no one is ever around for me. People just stay quiet, probably thinking it'll blow over. It does blow over or get better usually, but I'm left dealing with my stuff and shit myself for a long time. And I just feel awful and wish I had people to talk to. I know it's heavy and people don't really know well what to say. But please don't let me talk to myself or to a wall. So yeah, I'm mostly talking to myself / the void / the wall now. I feel like banging my head against something. Might cause myself to get a concussion this way but I might feel better then or fall asleep.

It’s important to understand depression can literally suck the life out of you. I actually live with depression and I have boyfriend who does not struggle with mental health issues. He always makes sure that he listens to me and doesn’t judge. The best you can do is be there for her and take the bad days that come along. Depression affects everyone differently. For me it was isolation, low energy, guilt and feeling empty. I also lost interest is a lot of my hobbies. If your girlfriend is struggling with these symptoms just keep an eye on her. Make sure you keep positive energy around her and smile. I love that my boyfriend was always so positive and silly around me when I was feeling down. It would really help sometimes.

I am thinking about rehoming my puppy because I have so much going on in life (my dad is sick, I’m severely depressed, etc) that he is being neglected. I don’t mean neglected in that he has food and his health is being taken care of, but it’s time and attention he doesn’t get. He is a large breed and needs exercise to thrive and be happy. I’m unable to give him that and because I am drowning in this depression, it is causing me more distress worrying about him. I love him so much, but often think I’m selfish to do this JUST so I don’t feel the sadness of not having him around anymore. I would love to know he is free to run around, be happy and just be a dog. I’m looking for thoughts on this, but please don’t be cruel as I am already feeling guilty about even thinking about this option to reduce my stress and worry and yo start to focus on my mental health.	tango_nurse	post	28.99982772959253	female	White	0.9942581653594971	na	na	na	2	depression_help

"I am sorry that you have had to endure this terrible disease... It is rough and I know how very challenging it can be.

Remember this Depression doesn't make you a failure.  Persevering through it make you strong.    So here is where the weapon of perseverance delivers a mortal blow to your enemy depression. You simply tell depression: “I’m never giving up or giving in to you. You may continue to plague me, but I’ll fight you with everything I’ve got. My emotions don’t belong to you, and I refuse to let them be held hostage without a fight. You may knock me down, but I’ve decided to keep on getting up. And I’ll fight you every time.    Say it out loud.  Say it out loud.   You have already shown that you are fighting it.. by getting on medicine, by going to therapy and returning again.  Say today, I will make one step forward.. If that step forward is brushing your teeth,.. then consider that a win!  

By persevering and doing these things you are breaking the cycle.  You are no not simply going to give into it... You are deciding to fight this depression even when you don't feel like it.. even when you don't want to get out of bed or brush your teeth.. this process will give you more control of your emotions.. As you decide to fight it you are building confidence in yourself.  

 God has a special place for those that endure.  Depression does not make you a failure. Instead, it makes you a winner in God’s eyes ....   I will keep you in my prayers and never stop persevering!

I feel judged by them, less worthy, ashamed and scared. How do I get rid of this ugly feeling of low, unworthy, shame and Humiliation. We have meetings on our efficiency and accuracy every 2-3 months. My meeting is on Monday. I am afraid of feeling humiliated, judged and good for nothing. It just makes it more difficult to live.	red_sweet11	follow-up	na	na	na	0.004385062959045172	no	strong	no	na	depression_help

I'm so sorry, that sounds super tough. I've been a bit less productive at work becomes of personal issues so I definitely understand that unworthy feeling you said about. Are they aware that you are struggling? Because when I told my boss he was super nice and cut me a lot of slack. What you're going through sounds really hard and I'll tell you right now that you have nothing to be ashamed of. We all struggle sometimes and that's ok. No matter what they think, it is totally understandable that issues in your personal life are distracting you from work. How could they not? Whatever happens I want you to remember to be kind to yourself. I know it's hard, but you don't deserve to feel like this. Try and treat yourself this weekend. Do something you enjoy or meet up with friends or something. Eat out or buy a hat. Just remember that you don't have to be ashamed of struggling, and you are totally worthy.

It's no problem. I get what you mean. Whenever I see my doctor and she asks how things are, I hate saying theres been no improvement. But things have to get better right? People don't have the right to judge you for struggling. I'm sure they've struggled too and should be treating you with the patience and compassion they'd want to be treated with. Try to forget what other people think about it. Focus on you. How you feel about your situation and how you want to feel. What's important is being patient with yourself and making sure that you're ok. Put yourself first and remember that it's ok to struggle. Its not your fault. You have no reason to feel shame.

"I'm a 23 y/o male, and I'm starting to feel the repercussions of my actions (or inactions,) and my depressed lifestyle. I realized I was a part of the gang when I was 17 and just couldn't find it in me to go to school, and I've been struggling to deal with it ever since. I'm pretty sure I have ADHD, and recently have been taking medication to manage that. I think that's helping but it's too soon to tell. I've always been incredibly disorganized, messy, socially awkward, and inattentive. That last word is important. To cope with the struggles of life, and all of the tough shit you gotta take care of- I found a solution. Ignore it. (/s, do NOT do this.)

 In 2021 I had a good job; I bought a reasonable car at an unreasonable rate, and got myself a couple of credit cards to run up as high as I can! I figured what the hell, I'm making enough money I can pay it all off with time. (The job wasn't even that good, I was just younger and dumber.) Anyways, after a year I couldn't deal with it anymore, had a mental breakdown, and walked out. I think they were about to fire me anyway, but that would have been much better for me. I went without a job for a couple of months and burned through my savings and whatnot. Now I'm a chef making chef's pay (albeit pretty decent for the industry standard.) I stopped paying my car loan because I couldn't afford it. Same with my credit cards, and my electricity bill. I didn't pay for anything except rent, internet, phone, and food. I mean excluding the numerous amounts of stupid unnecessary purchases to make myself ""feel better."" For over TWO YEARS now those debts have all been ticking away, waiting for someone to do something about them. I ignored it.

 Now I'm starting to feel the pain and embarrassment.

 For starters, my power was ""shut off"" today. Someone came out to disconnect it and for some gracious reason, there was a problem, which led them to leave it on today. That's a whole other story I'm not going to tell because this is way too long already. I'm finally going to make a payment arrangement with them tomorrow, because now I have to of course... The bank I have the car with sent me a letter more serious than the ones they've sent before and mentioned they need to collect $16,000 by August 25th, or they will be taking action. (I have like $200.) Either they sell the debt to someone else, come and collect the car themselves, or press charges. But I'm going to have to deal with that soon. I can't stop thinking about the embarrassment of having my car repo'd.  It is extremely important to have a car where I live. If you don't, you need to rely on someone else, which gives me the most piteous feeling deep in my guts. I put myself here.

 The credit debt adds up to at least $10,000 (who's even counting at this point?) I worry I'm going to face litigation. 

TL/DR; I need to file bankruptcy and actually start doing something to fix my life financially.

 The problem is that I feel so, *so* lethargic. And apathetic. All of the time. Some people would say that I'm lazy, and a lot of the time I couldn't even argue with that. I can't find the energy to deal with everything I need to. My job drains me so much already, and I know I should seriously get a second one to ramify my financial situation. But I don't think I can even handle it. I can barely take care of myself right now. My apartment is disgusting and grimy, and that in itself is like a beast hovering over me all the time. It's so daunting. I think I attracted Phorid flies to the place. They've infested my apartment :((( I'm dealing with that daily. Though I don't think it's completely my fault; my apartment is prone to mildew, so I think there are some plumbing issues. I've cleaned the drains, counters, and reachable pipes. I think their breeding ground is in the wall or in the ground by my bathroom, because I can't find it. I know plenty of you reading this are skeeving out reading that. So am I. I hate it to the core. I haven't been keeping or making food here, I don't shower here, my room is my only solace. They haven't infected this room thank god. I have a few cellar spider buddies that take care of the stragglers :3.  I want to move somewhere else, but I don't think I can find an apartment I can afford. I pay $400/mo right now. You don't find that anywhere. It's basically the only reason I'm not homeless right now. 

Gaahhhh this is taking so long for me to write, and I need to go to bed. There is so much more that I want to say but I'm not going to add here. Ask me whatever, or wonder about it in your head, I don't know. I made this post to rant, and seek guidance. How do I deal with it all? How do I find the energy? To me, depression is like a vicious cycle that causes problems that just make you more depressed.

I will add in this last tidbit that I get recurring and intrusive suicidal thoughts. I'm not a risk though. There are people in far worse situations than me. I have not, nor will I act on those thoughts. But I needed to admit that fact. It's a harrowing feeling to want to die. Life will get better. For me, for you, and anyone else who deserves it. I hope everyone reading this finds themselves happy and at peace in the near future. "	OBJ_Musik	post	24.277019349550073	female	White	0.9922141432762146	na	na	na	1	depression_help

"Throw away account for obvious reasons. Will try to keep this short. 

A bit of background;

I had an extremely abusive childhood, abuse mainly came from my dad. This resulted me moving out of the house at 15. 
My mum then left my dad when I was 19 and all 3 of us have lived, separately, alone ever since. Like the title says, I am now 25. 

I have been living alone for 10 years now. Renting privately from landlords. 

I had some crappy luck with my most recent landlord.
 My ceiling collapsed due to a leak in the roof, leaving the property uninhabitable.

I am a very quiet, people pleaser,  type of person. Hate confrontation. 

My landlord told me he would reduce my monthly rent by £100 and I could sleep on a blow up bed on the floor. I didn’t have any other option at the time so agreed. 

2 months later, I was still paying him £800 to sleep on the floor and no repairs had been scheduled. 

Landlord then tells me I need to leave the property as he wants to sell as it’s too much upkeep. 


I didn’t put up any resistance to this as, like I said, people pleaser. 

 Due to the cost of living crisis and the crazy rental prices in the city I was living in, I couldn’t find anywhere and only had enough money to move my belongings, as I had spent a considerable amount on getting my back adjusted by a chiropractor. Sleeping on the floor really isn’t good for you. 

My only option was to move in with my dad or sleep in my car. 

Now I am starting to wish I picked the car. 

It’s like I am a 6 year old again. Having to ask permission to do anything; eat, shower, go out, ANYTHING. It’s a bungalow so as soon as I leave my room, he can see me from wherever he is in the place. It’s like I’m being monitored in a prison 24/7. 

I am so used to being alone that I am just paralysed. 

More importantly I HATE my dad for what he did to me growing up. I HATE HIM. I genuinely can’t express that enough. 
Now that I’m older he pretends like nothing happened and says ‘oh I don’t remember’   He acts like IM crazy and making things up. I’m loosing my mind. 

I haven’t left my room in 2 days and haven’t eaten in 2 days because I just can’t face it anymore. 

I have been back and forward with doctors my whole adult life trying to get therapy. No help has been offered since I left the CAM’s service at 17.

Please can someone give some advice on how to tackle this? This really is my last resort of trying to get some, any help. No matter how small of a piece of advice. I need it. Thank you in advance."		post	28.786878745615596	male	White	0.9984250068664551	na	na	na	21	depression_help
"You need to get out of there. This should be your priority. Roomates are a good way to start, you can find some on the internet, the same website you would find an apartment. I had my share of roomates in the past and only one out of five was a bad experience. This could give you some breathing room.

There is also resources available to you. Some for woman who are homeless or woman who are in an abusive relationship, those include family member. Bunch of hotline you could call. 

You need to fix one problem at a time. You can fix them all at the same time. Make a list and go through it. I would start by eating something. Food is energy and your going to need it. Drink a tall glass of water, it should open your appetite. 

Once you are settled, you should search for a therapist. I know you tried that before but trust me they can and will help you. I know, they saved my life a long time ago.

"Good evening,

I have been in some abusive places before and some places where I could have really hated some family as well!

But one very important lesson that I learned years ago; ""The more you hate someone, the more anger, hate and rage build up inside of you!"" The only way that you are going to become free of that prison in your own mind is to be willing to forgive him! give him the undeserved grace and forgive him! By doing that it frees up your mind from all that built up emotions that you have been carrying around all of these years. He has no bondage over you anymore!

"Hello, this is an incredibly upsetting situation, but you will get through this. I myself had a crappy set of cards to deal with while growing up, and when you mentioned how you were kind of a people pleaser, I could totally relate to that. It's as if your subconscious mind is still living in fight or flight mode, causing you to avoid upsetting anyone or anything. So, you tend to conform and be nice in whatever situation you're in. Trust me, I get that. Your situation is unique to you, but now you have a responsibility to heal from this. Don't let this become your identity, or the landlord situation will just continue along with other circumstances.
Firstly, listen to what everyone is saying in the chat and prioritize moving out. Look for roommates, check out ""Kots"" (assuming you're a student), or if you're working and living in Europe (which I'm assuming since you use euros), you can easily find a room for 500 euros to share with someone.

But the issue is, what's next? What if a roommate abuses your people-pleaser attitude the way your landlord did? 
For example, if we learn how to not people-please (which, trust me, is hard and not as easy as a lot of people say – it's not just standing up for yourself, it's literally rewiring your brain and letting go of past trauma), then we won't end up in situations where we say yes to landlords who don't fix a leaking roof or who misuse and abuse you. I feel like some of the symptoms you have can be related to childhood ptsd or c-ptsd but don’t listening to a random Redditor and take it as truth! Go see a professional!!                            Trust me, there are going to be plenty of leeches out there who will suck you dry. The landlord situation, to me, feels like a wake-up call for you. It forced you to go back home as well. The cycle will continue as long as the core of the issue is not addressed. So, I would say your next and most important priority would be to find a good therapist. I know that it can be hard, but don't give up. Keep fighting. Tell yourself, tell your mind that you will find someone, that you will get through this, that you will transform. Put that intention out there and then start looking, both for a new place and for therapy! I wish you all the best and to let you know your not alone!

"Hi there.  Im so very sorry with what you're going through.  My friend, there has to be a way you can move away and get your freedom back.  You need someone to talk to. Your heart, soul and, mind needs to heal. Does he ever leave the house so you can find a way to talk to a counselor?  A father is someone for a daughter and a son to look up to. Not this. Maybe you can try talking to friends or family that is willing to listen? I have gone through abuse as a child,  so my heart  very much understand. Again all i can think of is the counselor or psychologist to see if they can help you. Im not sure what your religious belief is, but can i pray for you. If its not okay, it's okay to delete this.  I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers.  I send hugs hope, and protection.

Dear Lord, you are mighty and powerful. Please help my friend.  She has gone through so much my Lord. You said ""ask anything in my name and you shall receive it. ""  So i ask and please for your protection and a way to help my friend.  She is under her father's control and he has no kindness in his heart.  Help my friend to be free and find somewhere else to live and heal.  She needs your healing my Lord.  Please heal her mind, body,  and soul.  Help her to find joy and peace.  I ask of these things as well.  Precious is she and she has strength.  Please keep that power of stregth going on within her.  My Lord with your power,  i speak to my friend and i speak hope in her, and i  speak happiness into her heart. And Lord as friend, i speak love into her, to let her know this sister sends love and may she have a chance to receive and send love in the near future. Bless her my Lord.

I apologise, I just re-read your post and saw that you’ve been back and forth with therapy… I get the annoying this is not working no one is helping feeling. It almost feels like everyone who needs therapy ford through that. However keep your intention out there, don’t give up. Ask for guidance and help and someone who can help you heal but at the end of the day it’s all you! Let’s say you find a good therapist or a psychiatrist and they understand you and your finally getting over people pleasing flight or fight mode, but then you might have the tendency to credit the therapist then yourself… this is what I mean, whether it’s positive or negative being aware that you have the power within you and it will be you who will get you out of this is the biggest first step!		reply	na	na	na	0.9984250068664551	strong	no	no	na	depression_help

"You have to change your mindset.

 I know that sounds fucking impossible and it is.

But your mindset is your perspective and your perspective is more than you think because although the world doesn’t revolve around you, every single concept and way of thinking and seeing the world down to deeper levels than you’d think; Everything you have ever experienced in your entire life has been from your perspective.


I have mdd, and maybe i’m vain for saying this but even counting so much pain.

Pain that felt like it would never end.

I feel so happy that i didn’t commit suicide. 

For a long time I believed that everything was meaningless. And maybe it is, this place is so large so why would i matter right? 

It’s all constructed, and even in saying that i’m hypocritical because there are infinite ways of seeing life and just realizing that has had such an effect on me. 

If I read this a few months ago, a few years maybe, I would say it’s fucking bullshit, what is the point of this in the first place i’m not going anywhere with this argument… trust. me.  please.

I know you hear this all the time, and I hated hearing it but when psychologists responded to my question of how to bear with existence because it was just fucking unbearable. And the would respond with : think of the future, parents, pets.

I’m sure there’s a reason why they say this that I don’t know about but I sure would’ve wanted to know because hearing that made me feel even more hopeless because if this person, who has studied this for years says that it makes you think… really? that? that is the best thing that generations of psychological research can give me???

But it hurt so bad. so goddamn bad. 

I kept thinking I was at rock bottom and then the earth would crumble into more and more of a fucking hole.

But I kept going, not because I wanted to, not because I felt even the slightest bit of hope, but because I didn’t want to die. Nobody wants to die.
They want to start it all over again because they know they’re too far gone to be saved. Or just for it to stop. For even the simple act of being to become your torture is the worst… idk how to describe it, but I don’t have to.

You know.

Months of nothingness rotting down my mind.

I just felt completely out. As though my soul was gone and my body was just a robot, but this robot felt afraid.

Because it couldn’t be the way it wanted

To exist is to be

The robot exists.


But I became relatively stable.

Not happy, no. Just stable, existing the least I could.

I went to Taiwan, a place of many great memories I had, but for some reason I couldn’t feel it. At all.

I Grieved my death, the death of the silly goofyman. I stayed in my room some time, but there was now a motive. I know there’s a reason to live but I look and it isn’t there. But still I go out, I become distracted, and distracted in a way that I would as a child as I browsed the clear case full of intricate model cars and their size as I contemplated for thirty minutes if I wanted to get one.



All these things added up into my subconscious and built something that I was completely unaware of. 

The thing that flipped the switch was watching Oppenheimer in IMAX which is ironic because of the depressing atmosphere, but it was the depth of that turned me. Even though there was so much that was gut-wrenchinly depressing, The visions of science, this strange world that works somehow. And everything else made it something special to me.

I loved science, I loved exploring its possibilities and secrects. And I still do, that unknowing sense of wonder that made it terrifying yet so wonderous, as though it were a particle in superposition.

This feeling was always there, but I couldn’t feel it.

But watching Oppenheimer on IMAX? Fuck you, it’s gonna make you feel wether you like it or not and you will, the narrative the visuals the sound made me feel it. 

It made me hear the music.

I loved thinking of things so i did, and it made me so happy to turn these wonderful thoughts into a thing!!! And now with the feeling of wonder and silly goofyman attitude I feel happy for just existing. For even the simple act of being to be happy is the most… idk how to describe it, but I don’t have to.

Because you will know how it feels.
Because I fucking said so.

Depression is like having your eyes gouged out and thrown as you’re left to die but if you don’t die… you will one day figure out that it was a really tight blindfold, it was really tied up shit went like testicular torsion but you can see the mountain now. A beautiful mountain, and after being stuck and tied up in folds of impossible cloth, maybe taking a little hike would be fun…

I wanted to write this because it was life changing for me these past weeks and even the small chance that a person that reads this could be like me, or I don’t know…

Life is finite, but it’s not small, that ain’t the way to think of it.

I’m only 14

And wow. A lot has happened, i’ve had so any thoughts and changes shifting slowly. And looking ahead at all this time, and if this isn’t even all of it.

Maybe I’m naive or maybe not but all I know is that I’m me and that’s fuckin crazy.

There are so many other things I could say but I think it’s about time.

To me, to anyone that thinks like me, or simply relates to me or just likes the text or something else that i… yeah um to people and also me I hope you feel at least the smallest spark of hope in your heart.

I hope you are all blessed with warm hugs, good pastries, i want a croissant now

:)

"Hello everyone. I posted (probably a few months ago now and definitely on a spare account) that id recently picked up smoking weed as way to ""handle"" my depression and that I was feeling much better as a result. Truth be told, it did give me some personal clarity that I was sorely missing but, that time is passed. 

I realized that, no it wasn't making me feel better. It was making me content and passive, which I quickly grew to dislike as a result. Most of my life has been relegated to being passive and letting things that bothered me, stick with me and that has been changing slowly.

Recently? I've given up the weed and began shaving again. I've starting mixing intermittent fasting and exercise into my life to help give me confidence to feel better physically. The bushy mountain man I was months ago is long gone and I've done my best to maintain my routine. Now just feeling the stubble grow into place has been enough to make me shave.

Now, that isn't to say all days are perfect. I still fluctuate sometimes in being irritable and moody but it's s a process i'm learning to disengage from and focus on other things. It hasn't been easy and I'm certainly not done with it by any means but that won't stop me.

This post isn't to say ""don't smoke weed"". Honestly? If it motivates you and helps you feel better about yourself, do it! Strive to be the best version of yourself you choose to be! This is just how I'm working on my situation, everyone is different. 

Remember that regardless of how alone you feel, people do love you, and care for you well being and want you to feel better. Depression is the most dangerous thing I've come across in life and it is debilitating. But we can all work together to make life better! 

Everyone's mental health is important, don't discredit yourself and your own improvements. 

Never give up, Never surrender, Never back down."	WoopFruitloops	post	27.456604037618547	male	White	0.0051344009116292	na	na	na	3	depression_help

Hey guys. Im 17f and for school, I’m writing a 10 page essay about the positive mental effects of owning a pet during adolescence (teens). I need quotes from people (will be anonymous) about how your pets helped you when you were suffering.

There are some excellent guided meditations on YouTube for social anxiety. If you just use the search term “guided meditation for social anxiety” you will find numerous videos for overcoming this form of anxiety. It’s a very common concern. Guided meditation can help you to slow your thought process so that you are not overthinking every word that you say. It allows you to remain at peace in social settings. If you practice guided meditation everyday, you will start to notice a shift in how you perceive social settings. You will be more comfortable just being who you are. Guided meditation helped me to get off of prescribed medication for anxiety and depression. It’s a truly powerful tool if practiced consistently each day. I hope that you find it as liberating as I have.	someoneinlife1	reply	na	na	na	0.9994632601737976	no	no	no	na	depression_help

I kinda fell off the wagon with meditation but I have started again this week and it does help me feel at peace during the meditation, and feel okay with who I am. It just doesn’t seem to last once I’m around people and have nothing to say, but I’m probably looking for results too soon, I’ll keep at it thank you ❤️	someoneinlife1	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9994632601737976	no	strong	no	na	depression_help
It took me over two weeks of practicing twice a day before the benefits began to extend beyond the meditation period. Someone said that it had taken me a long time to develop and reinforce the thoughts that resulted in anxiety and depression, and it would take some time for meditation to unwind that pattern of thinking. It was true. I had been convincing myself that I had to be socially anxious and depressed for so long that I forgot how to think and to act differently. I continue to practice meditation everyday, and the benefits keep growing. You can overcome these negative thoughts and emotions. You are generating them in your own mind, and you can develop new ways of processing them to find peace. I also came to understand that people weren’t as aware of my social anxiety as I had believed. They had their own problems to overcome, and weren’t all that focused on my faults. I hope that you feel better soon.	someoneinlife1	reply	na	na	na	0.9994632601737976	no	strong	no	na	depression_help

You will know better than most that death does not end pain and suffering, it merely passes it onto the next poor person.

"You’re frequently pulled in the direction of sadness . Those memories will come up and more we try to suppress the more they tend to bubble up. It’s like a child going unheard.

Best way I’ve ever heard it described is leaves on a stream you don’t judge your thoughts you don’t focus on one thought you put it on a leaf in the stream of your mind and watch it float by. 

Our good habits are what gets us through life . Tony Robbins calls it 6 human needs tons of people describe this. I’d encourage looking them up but each describes an area of your life and how much you’ve fufilled that need.few of them that come to mind are variety , certainty and significance. The feeling of drinking certainly will lead to feeling good at one point during night but surely won’t make us feel significant or give us much variety. Start focusing on “feeding” the right areas of your life and I promise it gets easier.

You are absolutely equipped for existence. You are highly introspective, and especially sensitive to the needs of others. That is a virtue, but it’s a virtue that must be properly managed. You are allowed to jump off of the hamster wheel, and to realistically assess what you can and cannot achieve in a day. You are allowed to establish realistic expectations, and you are allowed to say no when you feel under too much pressure. It can be difficult for a kind and giving person like you to slow down and to practice some self care. But it is essential.

"I found myself in a similar situation at my job. Forgive me if this doesn’t apply to you, but these ideas usually come from seeing other people do things a lot easier and faster than you, with fewer or no mistakes. Which creates an “im not good enough” mindset. The question for you, is what are your realistic goals, vs expectations? 

Without knowing what you do, your post is a great question to ask your boss or supervisor! They can help put your mind at ease by telling you all the things you are capable of and areas to develop, which can be a huge weight off your shoulders knowing how to become that ideal you strive for!

I was born to a 15 yr old who was the daughter of a crack addict and a crack dealing father. I was dropped on my head early on leading to a dent in my pre frontal cortex. I have an undiagnosed executive function disorder that was masked well due to my mom beating the shit out of me when my school threatened to call CPS due to my early warning signs. I've spent my life raising 3 of my 15 siblings, being physically and verbally abused for attempting to reign in the household. I had a stalker that was allowed in my home for 2.5 years because my mother wouldn't believe that I wasn't dating her. 
I was jumped often in middle school and because of that I found martial arts. Though that I've found a place to express my emotions. I also developed a hero complex from literally basing my personality off of the Red power ranger from the original series. Throughout highschool I found that I'm most desired for sexual ecplorts and found some sort of validation in the attention sex would bring. It brought a lot of young women into my life that used manipulation tactics, verbal abuse and threats of self harm to keep me around when I wouldn't be interested in a relationship. One of which that deeply scars me to this day is the manipulation of the fact that there's gaps in my memory due to my efd. I found myself with these women often because of trauma bonding, a desire to ""save"" them and a belief that I only matter when and exist to help others. 
In college I begin to explore alt relationship structures and realize I'm poly. I find community with other alt relationship folks. In college I'm raped by a co worker who waits until I'm so drunk I can't walk, tell everyone she's going to get me home safe, makes me smoke and then rides my soft dick until she comes and kicks me out to the streets of Brownsville Brooklyn. 
I keep trying to help people. I make friends through magic and anytime someone showed minor interest in me id give myself to them. Destroying friend groups in the process. 
Post college I'm sa by an ex lover who invited me to their house and when I expresses no interest in sleeping with them cause they had a bf, took advantage of the fact that there were no trains, no buses till the morning and i couldn't afford a cab to constantly touch me, and give me oral. 
Then she told me I left my keys at her place, met her to pick them up and she proceeded to tell me I molested her, that she told her bf and he's looking for me, that we should get group therapy together because she doesn't want to lose me as a friend and that I didn't rape her because she knows what rape is. 
I spent an hour Infront of a police station talking to the only person i know who'd look at this situation neutrally and if she told me I sa this woman I'd turn myself in.
I found myself training muay Thai, finding friends and shifting all my bad habits to smoking excessive amounts of weed, ignoring broken legs/toes/skin/left hand/left orbital all to chase the moment of true happiness I get when I'm training. Years of poor choices down the line and habits of choosing not to eat, barely drinking water, sleeping with anyone who showed the slightest bit of care, running off of an 8th of weed a day, and ignoring any and every health issue I found myself with someone who actually cared. 
Who actually wanted more of me. More with me. Who loved me. We weren't healthy together, we were better off as friends but both of our self destructive patterns brought us together. Months of arguing over nothing, manipulation through questioning my love for her, destruction of self image because coivd took my opportunities and had to rely on her I find myself deep in a depression that starts it all. 
Starts the going out and looking for any all affection, blowing all of my money on drugs to numb the pain of never feeling like enough, training 5 hours a day and causing kidney failure, regressing emotions to protect hers, putting in zero effort into life, and hoping with no plans.  
I made many decisions over the course of my time with this ex. Many were bad. Even with justifications of the toxic environment one shouldn't hurt the one they love. Some of these decisions led to separating myself from a home that didn't care for me and losing 3 of the people closest to me. One of these decisions is to push back my suicide date to 25 so I have time to change my mind. 
I see myself now making these decisions again. Having a chance to do better and making choices that's just a step removed from the failures I've made in the past. I'm scared. I'm scared because I'm on my own, with no place to go and finally have to stand on my own two feet. I fear that the loop of choosing what will hurt me is too strong to break. That even with the support of someone who truly loves me, and shows it in a way that's healthy I may not be strong enough to break away. 
I've been told I'm strong my whole life. There's one thing that somone I once knew said that's been ringing in my ears. ""How long can you be strong Day? How long till you can't be strong anymore?"""	Dakingkwan	post	26.897539870529886	male	White	0.9851388335227966	na	na	na	4	depression_help

"The easiest thing I can tell you is that you are not the only one and we must all fight.

When i was 9y my neighbour manipulated me into sexual relations he was 18 at the time and like that fer two years until i didn't realise that was wrong because from where i come from in Croatia back in 2009 you didn't speak about Shit like that and that destroy me from within that killed all willingness in life for me.

Then few years after when i was 15 my girlfriend and group of friends ended their life and i was left alone without anyone to understand me only with alcoholic father and mother that would give up on me if god told her that so she was really zelus person.

After that shit i move to Belgium to my sister's place but we had to live because her husband was abusive and i almost l.

Then my sister manipulated me to get into relationship with 40y woman so we would be accepted in safehouse i was to stupid and naive to see that they just used and my sister didn't give a dam about my mental health of wellbeing i tray to end my life 5 time's i cut my whole arm's, legs and chest then i relied that i am completely alone and on my own.

Now i am sufering and hating my self i become asexual i have trust issues, I can even talk to people without normally I star sweating, feeling uncomfortable just want to disappear alcohol and weed are my best friend for last 7 year's.

But i reached out for professional help and good people on Reddit and all sorts of forum's and it helps to have people understand you and what are you going through.

"So l am a 19 yr old male and for the last couple months
I've been struggling a lot through life, I've been trying to get into n medication or find something that can help me out. I've done weed for quite a bit and that seem to stop helping. I've even made the wrong decision and got into alcohol and I'm about a month and a half in and it barely helps, I have to get to the point where I can pass out in peace to at least stop me from thinking about it and get some sleep. I'm barely and adult and I brought up my mental status to a couple family members to see if they can help me out. My mom just got mad at me and told me I am just lazy. My step dad calls me selfish, lazy, and says it's for attention and he doesn't believe I'I do it. And my uncle actually last night, I brought it up to him because he noticed something was wrong, I told him and he did the same as everyone else, got mad, and yelled at me. The thing that really messed me up is when he pulled a gun out, handed it to me, and said if your gonna do it then do it.
I sat there and just stared blankly at the firearm. And then he brought up he thinks of the same things and said my life is easy, and I have nothing to be upset about. But then he asked me if I wanted to have a contest and see who could do it faster. Maybe he was trying to help but I couldn't see it that way. I Always look for the good in people. I always seem to forgive the people that hurt me physically and mentally. But that made me feel as if nobody believes I'll do it and now I sit here and wonder if I prove them wrong and show them that it's not for attention and that I do struggle and hurt every single day but try my best to hide it so things like this don't happen."

"Their reactions are crap but unfortunately some people who don't have the same feelings react like that as they don't fully understand.

People with amazing lives still have these feelings, it's not to do with your life situation.

Definitely don't prove them wrong, that doesn't do anyone any good.

I suffered for a long time with similar but not quite as severe depression later on but the call to end it still comes up occasionally but it's not a constant and it's not strong.

I'm doing a lot better than I ever have and this is what I found helped, doesn't mean it's the right answer but it worked for me:

Stop the drug and alcohol, for me the come downs and sober moments became worse than if I wasn't doing it. The relief was there but I wasn't making anything better for myself and just felt worse in the between moments.

Get an escape, whether it's books, video games, building models, find something that you can use as a way to refocus or get your mind to be out of your current self. This gave me the relief I wanted when I needed it.

Treat your depression like a bully. Make it the enemy, realise that it's intrusive thoughts that aren't doing you any good. It takes a while but what got me going the most was making that side of my brain the enemy, it would tell me I couldn't do this or that or wouldn't amount to anything and this or that, use that as if a bully said it to you, swear at it, shout at it if you need to, then get out there and prove it wrong. It's not easy but it's helped me.

Again this might not work for everyone but sometimes having suggestions and finding what does and doesn't work for you will help you find a way forward."	SemiSane420	reply	na	na	na	0.9980277419090271	weak	no	no	na	depression_help
"Your thoughts and feelings are real. The reason you forgive people so easily for hurting you is because you have not yet completed your mental view of the worldbuild. You don't yet connected intention and action to consequences between people. If you just realized that when people care, this is not how they act, therefore actions you experienced regardless of their motivations, were hurtful and you're entitled to feeling hurt, it would be a new experience and completely disrupt the world you're living in at the moment.

Even if you're lazy - let's assume what they're saying is true - even if it's true, no one wants to feel bad this way. No one wants to feel lost, confused, hurt, depressed. No one would ever choose to be disabled, no one would ever choose to be depressed. Those are simple truths.

It is most likely that your depression stems from the fact you live in an environment where you're constantly hurt and never supported. This age... requires support. You're technically an adult, but the actual challenge of going out and trying to deal with the world, this changes all of us into needy, scared children while it's happening. Normal families know this and try to help in this horrifying transition. Your family blames you instead of supporting you.

I think it's possible this depression simply is a gathering of all those behaviors your mother, stepdad, biological dad, and uncle did over your life. You never processed them properly, but those events happened, didn't disappear, this energy has to go somewhere.

Tell you what - imagine someone else in this situation. Anyone. Raised with this family and experiencing what you're experiencing. Do you really think they would feel differently?

Do you really think they wouldn't react exactly like you did? With all those feelings of disconnect between actions and consequences, vague depression, feeling life is easy so why am I so tired and hurt all the time.... I think your reactions, not your thoughts, should tell you what is happening. They're not supporting you - and you need support. You're right now in the process some people never complete and stay children their entire lives - process of correct building of worldview and how this all works.

Pulling out a gun is completely abhorrent, abusive and horrible.

Listen, I have a physical disability. I have a pet peeve where people's lives are easy but they complain. This does often happen. But no one wants to feel unhappy the way you do - you are suffocating. Obviously, you did not pick this. Obviously, your life may seem okay on the surface, but underneath there is something horrible.

Never ever trust your uncle again. He will never care about you and he will never think of your best interests.

You need people outside of home. Get a part time job maybe? Not for the money, but to give them something to focus on that you're doing something, while in the meantime, you're just doing your best to be away from home. You desperately need contact with mentalities that are directly opposed to your family's and you have to find these people.

"So glad I could do something.

As a person who escaped from abusive household (and yes, this stupid illness is a result of years of psychological abuse with no physical abuse, yes your mind can get broken like that) I feel for you. From perspective of age it's just so blatantly obvious that you're being abused and you struggle with seeing it clearly and have no real concept of automatically holding abusers accountable and establishing your own boundaries - both results of being raised in this household.

There's another perspective. We all have things our parents did wrong - but the moment we turn 18, it becomes out responsibility to slowly start working through this stuff to break the chain of shitty parenting. It's also quite horrifying to see this play out - I had a suicide attempt over realizing some adults were literally half as mature as I am at 14, that psychology ""professionals"" were morons who shouldn't be allowed near a psychology book and that plenty of people we are supposed to show respect to genuinely are not just stupid, but also immature. Stupidity can be quite innocent, immaturity in older folks is almost always deliberate. And it's so scary to see this clearly. Also, seriously, don't trust your uncle with even one dollar bill, ever. And limit your trust to the rest of the family. This isn't how people handle people they care about. Imagine you had a kid in your care, as you are, right now, that young and inexperienced. Can you picture yourself acting like this? I bet you can't. Judge them from this standpoint. At this point in my life I have checked practically a theory: ""Okay, what if your life sucks so hard you struggle with empathy and showing person with depression real support and consideration?"" And you know what I discovered? You can be less than support - and still not become abusive or mean and still you can validate their thoughts and feelings. Even if empathy comes hard for you, that means mental capacity has to be 100% - and acknowledging depression exists and no one really wants it is no rocket science. So your family could be deprived of empathy, could be functional psychopaths and they still could validate you: ""maybe we are not supportive or nice, but yeah, we get it, you're not pretending or doing this on purpose and yes, you deserve help and support right, right as shit"". Seriously. High functioning psychopaths who aren't criminals, but are normally raising families (yes, they exist and they have issues with empathy, but they're not outright evil) - these people are capable of a more of concern than your family shown.

But also I want to tell you... it gets better. If you put any work in, the amount of happiness available once you break the mental chains of how they think and stop replicating them is just unbelievable, like it's hard to believe it's the same universe. Happiness, competence and confidence are all available to you- but you have to do some work for them. Another concept your family doesn't get.

Please take care of yourself and be kind to yourself. And watch your diet. Try to eat vegetables and stuff. There's a connection between diet and depression, like, a serious one, scientific studies and all that.

And next time you talk to them and they say their usual shit, don't argue. It's pointless. They had years to mature and they're still stupid. The fact alone you came to reddit and spoke about the issue means you have more maturity and concern for others they ever had. When they say their shit, remember a person with physical disability, who can't go to a normal job and struggles with mobility knows you're not doing this on purpose or pretending. If I can acknowledge that yeah, even being 19-young and on the cusp of adulthood, without disabilities or people who rely on you financially, depression can still be so fucking tough and damaging, anyone can. My disability is invisible, I look normal and experience stupidity because of it and someone like this knows you're not doing this because you chose to and that your feelings and thoughts are valid. So what do they know? Let me tell you, I remember being at this stage - questioning my every thought and feeling, trying to find patterns in their behavior, depressed and sad and hoping I am mentally ill like schizophrenic, so my view of reality is just not correct, hopefully, this isn't actually this horrific - and I shudder at the memory. You are going through something incredibly hard, you do deserve help, empathy, concern and consideration. To me, being disabled, even with all the consequences, is so much easier than being 19 was for me. So look at them with some mental distance."

"I've been very depressed lately from some recent things happening in my personal life and I can feel myself getting worse and worse. For example I'm a 19F woman and used to work out 5 times a week, eat healthy, keep up appearances, be super outgoing and extroverted and now I can barely wake up in the moring, i force myself to brush my teeth and do my makeup and I can't even like what I see anymore on any occasion not to mention my social skills that I had went out the window. I feel so awkward now and so alone. I eat mostly junk food that I get for free at my min wage job and sleep through most of my days after work. While at work I work myself to the bone just trying to distract myself for the recent event and never engage with anyone. A coworker a few days ago walked up to me and asked me if I was ok because in her words ""you usally look so put together"" as I used to take a lot of pride in my appearance. I just said I'm ok just brunt out with work since that usally is a good enough anwser. I just want my Iife back. I want to work out again and eat better and wake up happy and be confident again. I started journaling and seeing a therapist but its not doing much. I can tell how much I've gone down hill and I see the slow  Descend im following and yet I can't do anything and trust me I've tired. Any tips would really help as I've said in the first part of my post I still do get up in the morning, brush my teeth, do my makeup, try to eat and journal and work to my fullest power but none of it is helping I mean I've even started listening to daily affirmations in the morning and still nothing.

Trigger warning for SA


I suppose I am just sad and angry. I was SA a month ago after working extremely hard to get to where I am in life. I mean like I worked two jobs for hours on end to be able to move out of my toxic home and live on my own. I did extensive hours of therapy to get my life back from the first one and FINALLY after 6 years I was able to somewhat feel normal. I started working out and eating well. Dressing well, talking to others, walking outside of my house without feeling petrified I even thought I looked pretty on some occasions. But after this last one it felt like all of that progress is gone. All those long hours hearing all those disgusting things customers would say to me and walking home at 3 in the morning clutching my switchblade was for nothing. I worked out heavily and thought for even a second I could defend mysel if someone ever tried to target me again but when it happened I froze just like I did 6 years ago. I am so angry and upset with myself. And frankly I feel like I'm losing my sanity. I just don't know if I can do this again I mean I lost 6 years of my life because of the first one and now I'm afraid ill lose my 20s to this one. I guess i feel I'm better off dead than suffer this anymore."	summerjane6119	follow-up	na	na	na	0.999424934387207	no	strong	no	na	depression_help
"Long story short: I’ve been in a very stressful child custody battle since 2021. It ended this morning and went generally how I wanted, with some compromise. 

I feel nothing. I don’t feel relief. I don’t feel happy. I feel nothing. I know I’ve been struggling with depression, low energy, in my head constantly and to top of off I had a baby last year so sprinkle some PPD in the mix. I have a therapist but have only seen her once so far and have an upcoming appointment. 

I want to feel semi normal again. Has anyone gone through this where you just have no feelings towards a situation where you expected to feel happy?"	KittenMittens6085	post	8.694823899485005	female	White	0.9994853734970093	na	na	na	3	depression_help

I don’t think that what you describe is uncommon. Going through a custody battle is filled with daily emotions: hopeful moments, moments of concern, uncertainty, anger, etc. It overwhelms your emotional network when you’re in the midst of it. When it ends, you have no more to give. You are emotionally exhausted. Add PPD to the mix, and it’s amazing that you’re still on your feet. You are very strong. Something that helped me in combination with therapy is guided meditation. The goal of guided meditation is to instill a sense of deep peace during both the highs and lows of life. There are some excellent guided meditations on YouTube for almost any state of mind. Practicing guided meditation can help you to better understand your pattern of thoughts and related emotions, or lack of strong emotion. If practiced everyday, guided meditation can bring deep insights to your life. Your mind has been racing, guided meditation allows it to slow down and properly process life’s flow. You will discover that all your emotional equipment is still in working order, and that you can observe it in peace. I pray that you and your family are blessed with much love, and a brilliant future.	KittenMittens6085	reply	na	na	na	0.9994853734970093	weak	strong	no	na	depression_help

Can dogs smell depression, or sadness. I just got a dog today and i was outside crying. She came up to me and is now currently sitting by me. She keeps looking at me. She nudges my hand a bit. But im just sad, i feel worthless that no one cares about me. Everyone leaves me, i try so hard to keep them, but my efforts never seem to be enough. My anxiety feels as if its getting worse, not sure how to feel.

Dogs can definitely sense when their person is feeling sad or depressed. I know when I am crying, my dog comes up to me and licks my face and tries to get my heads out of my hand. I know it can be hard, even putting any effort to do anything when you’re depressed but doing things with my dog taking him for walks and doing different activities really helps I don’t have a lot of people in my life, friends or family so my dog has really become an important part in my life, especially when it comes to happiness. And coming from experience if people can’t see what a good person you are, and how much you you did for them and they ended up hurting you in the end that’s their loss don’t think of it as you losing them they lost you DON’T EVER FEEL LIKE YOU’RE WORTHLESS.

Cars just remind me of consumerism and how we are destroying the world. All businesses are cheaply constructed with bright colors to try and attract our attention, but they are so shitty and ugly. 

No one gives a damn about making anything look decent anymore because that doesn't increase profits. So everyone is so greedy and builds all of these shitty metalsheet shacks and call it a day. I'm tired of being here. 

I can sometimes find release and comfort by sitting in parks or watching the water at the lake. But 90% of the world is just so ugly that I wonder whether it's worth living in.

"i probably should be doing this on a throw away, but fuck it right? i’ve never been on here before but i need to just put my thoughts somewhere so, here we go?

so i met this group of people (around 30) on twitter (weird i know), and we would stay in twitter spaces for hours everyday. that then moved to discord where a close group of us (around 15) have been hanging out ever since. we are on every night even if it’s just for a few hours and some of us fall asleep on there because we all love the community we have created and the safe space for discussion and love we have created for eachother. 

so here comes the stupid part from me. one of the girls live around 4 hours away from me, and after we all had meet, in a little over a month i was coming to their city for a concert  so of course we met and i had a hotel room so we where together for about 3 days. she slept over, we went out and she showed me around town and we had sexual tension the whole time. (side note, the whole group was constantly flirting with each other). nothing happened that time and we went home for a month 
Then pride came up and she wanted to come down here for it but also to see me and do “things”. and i didn’t think i was catching feelings for her and i didn’t want to because i knew i didn’t have the capacity to give her the emotions back that she needed if we were to get into relationship. so i wanted to do a friends with benefits deal because i had done previously with a few people, and it had never affected me. Obviously this time it was different so she came down and i was also dog sitting at the time so i had to run back and forth between the dogs and couldn’t stay the night at her hotel room. we definitely had fun but she immediately put up extremely hard boundaries that made me feel a little emotional, but nothing that i didn’t think i could handle.
she returned back to her city, and we had been flirting constantly, and sending pictures her talking about wanting to see me again. The only thing was at the same time about a week later after coming back, she started to re-develop a crush on a friend that she hadn’t seen in about a year, I didn’t think it would affect me and I had pushed for her to continue and make a move. And now they are dating and every time I see anything about her and her girlfriend it hurts deeply I think due to her making so many plans for the future and I’m also supposed to go up in September with another one of our friends to see her and go to a concert together. I just don’t know what to do because it’s sending me into a mental spiral and having to see her pretty much every day on discord with all my friends and her constantly talking about her girlfriend kills me inside, she also constantly tweets about her. I just don’t know what to do because I don’t wanna step away from my friends who have been my support system the entire time. I would just like some advice or coping mechanisms to not feel like I want to cut off all contact with everybody and start going down the depression spiral again.

also, please forgive any formatting or mistakes for grammar or anything like that because I’m currently talk texting and do not want to reread what I am writing because it’s hard enough to even say it out loud but alone type it.

"At 14, all I wanted to do was get out.

By 25, I thought I’d have it figured out.

And what I have found out, is that love was never really built on anything but religion and manipulation.

My parents say they loved me, but do you hurt and manipulate the ones you love? Do you force the ones you love into submission?
When the one you love cries, do you yell at them to stop? Do you tell the one you love that they have nothing to cry for?

And here I am now.

Cult: escaped

Family: estranged

Marriage: divorced

And all I know is that I have nothing and no one to lean on.

Sure there’s some who love me. And some who say they love me. But I feel as if there’s no one to trust. No one to pour my heart to. No one to listen.

I’m all alone. I just want love. I want to cry and cry and pour myself to someone who is willing to soak it all in.

That's a rough combination and certainly feels awful right now but it'll feel better after a while. When we switch the framework around, as one door closes another door opens. As one experience ends it blends into the beginning of the next like a change of seasons. It's a new season with new goals, a whole new exciting world, and when you feel better you can get out there and meet some awesome new people.

"Even though I'm only 17 years old -- still in High School -- I've been worrying about my future lately. More importantly, what will come of my future, and if I will l succeed in life. I'm worried that I will eventually fail my family, and lead a life of regret, thinking about what could've been. 

For starters, I've never had a job, and don't know where to start honestly. This is one thing that continuously brings me down. A lot of people my age have jobs and can easily juggle this with school and other hobbies, while I find it difficult to multitask like this. It would be a bit too stressful for me to focus on my school and work at the same time. I also travel between two households every night (divorced parents) and wouldn't have time for anything else. Though, again, the idea of me not having a job still makes me feel a bit behind. I am eventually going to college for 4 long years and would like to get a job during that time, but still, I don't know if I will be able to manage everything then either. I feel very insecure about this topic and always feel like I'm, again, behind everyone. 

I also have big dreams of who and what I wanted to become - always - but something has repeatedly told me these aspirations were a bit too high. I am afraid to tell anyone about them, fearing that they will laugh in my face or doubt my abilities. I'm not going to share my future aspirations here, as they are extremely personal to me, but I just wanted to showcase the point of my determination and doubt, which constantly battle each other. I don't know where I would go after college, as there are many projects that I would like to pursue, but I don't know how to get to the place I want to be in life. I don't know which direction I should take to start leading the life that I hope to maintain. I realize that too many people give up on their dreams early on, and I'm not typically one of these people, but I am still very concerned when I look toward my future. 

Lastly, I'm afraid that I won't achieve what I want to in life, and will end up failing my family. My family does so much for me, and I want to pay them back someday, but I don't know if I will be able to. They give me so much support and I want to be able to give that same support back to them someday and show how much they've helped me. I've practically done nothing in my life and I know I'm still young, but everyone around me has seemed to find their footing, and has everything mapped out. It feels as if everyone has got something going for them. I feel like I'm behind in every aspect of life, and have very little chance of catching up. 

My mind has been clouded with these thoughts lately, and have been finding it very hard to focus on practically anything. I don't know if this is a normal feeling for people my age either. But regardless, I just wanted to post this and see if anyone had any advice or similar stories to this. I appreciate whoever reads this, and any other help is appreciated as well. I wish the best of luck to anyone that is experiencing this or is in a similar situation."	Perennials12	post	17.955697472899917	male	White	0.025000926107168198	na	na	na	2	depression_help

One of the biggest things successful people have in common is that they listen to successful people. Learn learn learn.	Perennials12	reply	na	na	na	0.025000926107168198	no	no	no	na	depression_help
It sounds to me like you’ve accomplished a lot in your young life. You have a firm idea of your hopes and dreams for your future. Many people your age have not thought this deeply about their future place in the world. The fact that you have demonstrates a maturity beyond your years. You are also navigating a relationship with divorced parents, which is quite challenging, and your doing it well. You are managing and priortizing your time. You have a lifetime of paying work ahead of you. There is absolutely nothing wrong with prioritizing needs other than employment at this point in your life. You also express gratitude. Many people your age don’t aknowlege or express their deep gratitude or desire to pay it forward. You appear quite exceptional from my point of view. You are at one of life’s most challenging points. You are on the cusp of adulthood. The thoughts that you are having are natural for a person with your ability for introspection. In my long life, I’ve found meaning in life  by being in a daily purpose driven relationship with the things that I believe hold deep truths: ambitions, morals, ethical conduct, family, community, faith, and conceiving of a better future. You have the tools that you need to build an extraordinary life. Anyone with hopes and dreams also has a degree of fear. There is nothing wrong with fear. Note what  fear is telling you, learn from it, but once you have learned what you need to from it, move confidently past it. I pray that your young life is filled with many blessing, peace, love, and great purpose.	Perennials12	reply	na	na	na	0.025000926107168198	weak	no	no	na	depression_help
"I just wanted to talk and vent about some things. First i want to say that i’m trying to build better habits. I go to work come home, take a bath, read, draw cars, and i come back to reddit. This is my daily routine. 

I have many goals i want to achieve like moving out of my moms house, and getting on of my car drawings posted on a official Manufacturers Insta page. To be honest i feel like it’s a reach to hope for that much. I want to go to school for CAD too, but i’m waiting on my insurance to get setup and for my dad to finally give me my car. He’s keeping it, i practice driving with him to try to convince him but i barely get a chance too. I want to trust it when he says “he wants me to have the car” and i need to be ready and a safe driver to his standards before i get it. But sometimes i just don’t know. I put a lot of money into that car probably over $1000. I guess i’m just not ready yet. I’m 20 and i just feel a want for freedom in my life that i’ve never had. My life is very bland and i try so hard to make it through each day but it’s tough. It’s hard feeling so bad about myself. 

I got a job as a lot attendent at a dealership two weeks ago. I work full time, make like 13 an hour. It’s 10x better than my previous food jobs or retail. I’m thankful for that. Not only that but i drive multiple cars everyday but i still can’t convince my dad to let me drive mine. That i paid for. 

I have a lot of bad habits as well and i want to address them. I look on reddit here and argue with women on here about gender war stuff, I look at all these black pill ideologies about men and Sexual market value and how the early 20s as a man is the worst time to be alive. To make matters worse the other day i saw my ex, with another guy on tik tok. I deleted tik tok since then. She was my first gf a few months ago. It hurts to even talk about it. I find myself comparing myself to her and the other guy she’s with. Also i have a p hub addiction. It’s gotten significantly worse as i use it to degrade myself. I was bullied all my life and even walking everywhere i walk with my head down, people always are telling me to hold my chest out. It’s just natural for me. 

Back to the p hub addiction i look at degrading things that would be seen as humiliating. Basically i would look at those snap chat videos of girls cheating with dudes and have the captions with things saying “she says your not enough bro” or even worse. I think you get the picture. It’s humilation cucking. I pretend i was either friendzoned by the girl or she’s an ex or she was my gf but cheating, or she rejected me and i pretend the guy or her is sending it to my phone to make me heartbroken. That’s what i get off to. mainly because i don’t see me getting with a women anytime soon. I don’t think i will and i feel being that i will be lonely for a long time. Mainly because i can’t drive without dad giving me my car. I struggle to look myself in the mirror. I really don’t make much friends. 

When i get motivated i feel the need to have to build a whole business and be super productive or else i will forever stay in the place i’m at now. I feel like i have to learn skills and stuff i don’t have a ton of interest in and the threat of not doing it will mean a life of misery. I fall short a lot and i just need help on getting my life together. Maybe getting to finally talk to some women and seeing them as humans and not putting them above me. I don’t know what to do"	ShiestyTrackhawk	post	22.25658275547352	male	White	0.9941861629486084	na	na	na	1	depression_help

My depression has always been chaotic, sometimes it’s the “I feel no emotions and can’t empathize with others.” Or “I am extremely sad and I want to cry and sleep all day” or “I don’t know what I’m feeling because it’s like both of the previous combined and I’ll lash out at others”. Today is one of those.  I don’t understand why what I’m saying hurts others when usually I’m the one who understands too well. Yesterday someone bought me a very expensive gift and instead of feeling grateful I just became sad because it was so expensive. Now they’re upset because the least I could have done was say thank you. Some people don’t understand because I don’t have a reason to be depressed, others say I should get on anti depressants but that’s hard. My BC is a very tiny minuscule pill and I struggle every day taking it because of my gag reflex, I understand it could make me feel better I get that any maybe that’s an excuse idk I just don’t know what to do.

Go to the ER. Tell them exactly how you feel. Don’t be embarrassed and hold anything back. If you feel suicidal, TELL them. They might decide to admit you for a few days which sucks but they can start trying things to make you feel better maybe good sometimes. ( at least they do in the USA.

Being a parent myself, I think my generation tends to underestimate the importance of electronics and the internet to younger people. We grew up without it, so its a different perspective. I would suggest you attempt to reason with your Dad. Maybe attempt to calmly explain how important it is to your mental health and how it makes your schoolwork easier. But in turn keep up your end and do your best to get caught up with your schoolwork. Good luck.	somealtact	reply	na	na	na	0.998540997505188	no	strong	no	na	depression_help
Your family cares about you or they wouldn’t be looking for ways to improve your performance in school. They’d just let you fail in life. If you think that the punishment is too harsh, propose a compromise solution. Set a goal for catching up on your school work even if it’s impossible to catch up completely. Let your father know that you understand why he is angry, and that you know that he’s just trying to remove distractions so that you can catch up. Tell him that you won‘t be able to do well in school without a computer. Let him know that you’ll do better at prioritizing school, but that you also need time to socialize on the computer and to pursue hobbies. If you can’t find a compromise, ask him if he’d consider family counseling. Your father may be overreacting, and you may be too dismissive of his legitimate concerns. Believe me, if you weren’t loved, you’d be left alone. Love sometimes requires a parent to encourage a child to live their very best life. You can’t do that if you don’t try to keep up in school. Be calm, speak respectfully and sincerely to your father about what you can do to keep your things. There may be a compromise that you both can live with.	somealtact	reply	na	na	na	0.998540997505188	no	no	no	na	depression_help
"Don’t worry. You can always get a GED later in life, when your not under his rule. High school is not a requirement for everyone, nor some necessary right of passage that has to happen when your a young adult. 

You may want to look into getting a cheap “pay as you go” phone from Walmart or Target and get one with internet. Hide it from your dad. 

You could also looking into apply for credit cards, like Discover card, if 18 or over, and then go to Walmart/Best Buy and purchase the cheapest laptop they have. You can then use that. 

There are tools and ways to get thru this time- lean on school friends for support. Tell your guidance counselor and explain how important tech is to you and how callous your dad is purposely being.

I’m so sorry that you don’t have a loving relationship with your father. Know that you deserve to be loved by your father. If he is incapable of loving you, the problem is with him. It is unnatural for a father to withhold love from a his child. While you are living with him, the best that you can do is to try to develop skills that will allow you to live independently when you are of age. Doing well in school is part of develop those necessary skills. Do your best to gain knowledge and to develop a marketable skill set. If your school work is online, it makes no sense for your father to remove your computer. You will just fall further behind, which will cause Your father further embarrassment with whoever he is trying to impress. It is illogical for him to punish you in this way.

"Hey. I have scars along my wrist (some fairly recent) and working outside in the summer made it unbearable to wear long sleeves. Several managers and customers have seen and nobody has said anything. I don't think anyone is gonna mention it as long as you don't bring attention to it. Though I did tend to be less expressive and make less gestures with the injured arm just to try and limit what I could. Most people don't care because it's not their problem, which is kind of freeing once you realize it doesn't define your interactions with people. Just act like nothing is unusual and people will roll with it.

(Repost from r/depression) Life is getting so hard and I don’t get why it has to be like this. I’m having issues with everything and I’m barely keeping up with school. My parents don’t know anything about my issues and they can never know. I almost attempted on Sunday, the past few weeks have been absolute hell what with resurfacing traumas and terrible relationships with parents. As much as I care for my friends I don’t think I can live any longer like this. I’m stuck in a vicious cycle every night with my insomnia and severe loneliness practically killing me every time I go to bed. I try to spend time with friends but I keep isolating myself even when I don’t want to. I’ve always been somewhat vocal about my issues and I have friends who I value so much, but they can’t seem to cope with my issues. These issues have made me self centered and alone and I don’t know where to turn to. Therapy isn’t an option for me, the best thing I can get is school counseling, and tbh, it really sucks. I’m going insane and I don’t know how to stop spiraling, I don’t want to die but I’m so suicidal all the time. Someone please help. I can barely even show up to school anymore. I need a fix or even just some support.	Bulldoggy3000	post	20.95251686082457	female	White	0.9981982111930847	na	na	na	6	depression_help

I have had depression for about a year now and had mild depression for about 5 years prior. its pretty bad not in the sense that it stops me from doing much but im just so empty all the time it is terribely unbearable I eat well exercise very often I am 18 male and would like some advice to help with this I will try to make a post once a week updating on how it goes I know possibly the most important thing I could do is spend time with friends but I recently moved away from my hometown and now have no friends I can't make any at school because my social anxiety is to bad but yeh advice please I hope I can beat this one day and just be myself again	jwcnlwn	post	32.64989722205704	female	White	0.9975965619087219	na	na	na	4	depression_help
"Perhaps working on your social anxiety could help you meet new friends and in turn help a bit with your depression. You could find friends in places you frequent, where you do certain activities you like.  You might also ask yourself why are you feeling so empty? You sound like you’re putting in good to your life with eating and exercising, so what might be missing? Are you able to do things you enjoy? Are there things you want to try? Probing yourself with questions and answering them can be a great way to find the answers you need. Being 18 and being away from home is a strange time in life. And you’re not alone. There’s others at your school who feel the same anxiety. There’s a lot of new and unknown things. Be open and accepting of the change. Push yourself to get out there. 

A fun simple method you could try is a gratitude journal. At the start or end of everyday, write down 3 things that you are grateful/happy to have in your life. It can be anything you want. Doing so helps pull us away from depression by reminding us we have good things in our life. Write them down and sit in thought for a minute. Think about each thing and the feeling you get from having it. It could be anything from a physical item like a car or your bed to intangible things like the sky or your outlook on life. 

Wish you the best, friend"	jwcnlwn	reply	na	na	na	0.9975965619087219	no	no	no	na	depression_help
Something that helped me a great deal with both anxiety and depression is guided meditation. When it was recommended, I truly did not think it could possibly help. I even gave up a few times. But, once I committed to practicing every single day (sometimes several times a day) it started to slowly relieve my anxiety and depression. There are numerous guided meditations specifically for social anxiety and depression on YouTube. Depression and anxiety are problems of the mind, and guided meditation creates new ways of perceiving thoughts and emotions. You can live your best life, you just need some practical tools to help you. Guided meditation is one powerful tool. You appear to be motivated, intelligent, able to form friendships, and self aware. You have a lot to offer a world that needs more people like you. Things will get better for you. Relocation is one of life’s great challenges, and you are managing to stay motivated. Give yourself credit. Try guided meditation for at least two weeks, and practice daily. You may be surprised by the changes it brings about.	jwcnlwn	reply	na	na	na	0.9975965619087219	no	strong	no	na	depression_help

Ok. One thing you need to understand is that depression is a sickness, sadly your gf or even a big sister if you had one, could not cure you from said depression. You need professional help. Yes having a confidant can help you but its not enough. I know you tried seeing a therapist. I went through a bunch of those and sometimes it can take some time to find the right one. Depression can last for a long time. But as long as you stay strong, that you ask for help and that you follow those people trying to help you.

So, long story short. In a year I’ve had more loss of people I love, and due to some of my health issues more of the people I love have gone to absolutely hating me (in addition to my depression I also have a progressive, debilitating and life threatening illness). Really getting to the point where adrenal insufficiency’s no longer seeing the point. One thing I will say, this is the first time in my life I’ve EVER said such a thing (or typed such a thing) to anyone, let alone strangers on the internet. At this point, between the physical pain, the near constant of being so ill I can genuinely live for more than four hours at a time being violently ill in the bathroom, combined with losing many but admittedly not all of the people I love. I will also say, some of the people whom I still love, absolutely loath me at this point and are FREQUENTLY cruel or even hostile towards me due to my health not being what they feel like it should be or because they’re tired of me being the negative person. Even though, I’ve haven’t been as honest or forward with them about my health or depression because the one time in my life when I was it went really damn badly.  Just getting absolutely fed up. And honestly, the sick thing is, being on Medicare and Medicaid the nearest place where I could go to get help is too far away, and I’ve been warned that due to my physical illness, they can’t put me even if I were willing (and I’m not) to go for a psych hold and eval, for two reasons. One, if I’m rendered unconscious I have to have meds delivered IV every few hours or I’m dead. Two, the places in my state which could potentially help me are so far away I would not be able to get home after. So yeah, hit a real low this week. And it’s just Monday. Hope y’all are doing better than I am.	wondering2019	post	28.585971304822287	male	White	0.997055172920227	na	na	na	7	depression_help

A vast array of stuff. It started with my physical health. So lifting, eating well, water, and sleep. Next was working on healing and forgiving some traumas. Reading and listening to more up lifting things. As well as finding what I would fulfill my life in work. Obviously not doing it all at once. But it was progress. I’ve had ups and downs along the way still but ultimately learning how to navigate those tough times to make them not so tough.

"So, after a long hard year, I'm finally settling into a new normal. Pretty much everything that could go wrong last year is getting fixed.

I have a home again. Getting all my documents back. Focusing on being single. Got a new weight bench. Back in therapy and on medication. I'm eating again.

But yeah, I think about the past. I lost my job. All my old friends. My girlfriend. My apartment. My sanity. My sense of self worth. My personal freedom. So many things it was nonsensical. Such shame.

I used to be very irrational and angry about this. I loved these people and wanted my old life to work out. I went through a lot of pain to be here, getting the help I need. And I'm coming to terms that I can move on. And that is for the best.

But yes. I miss them. They still hold a special place in my heart. Yet I must come to terms that I tried my best to fix things. I'm not allowed to. I tried so hard. So they aren't here.

I accept this. I can heal and one day be free.

But I will miss them. And wonder how things got so bitter.

So, today I'm a different person. I have to be. For me.

But yes. It's going to be August in 6 minutes. A full year as far as I can tell, maybe a bit less.

Bittersweet. Sad.

But I must continue. And I must do that for me.

So old friends. I miss you. I'm sorry I was sick.

So it's time to look forward. Time to dream again.

I can relate to what you’re feeling. I was in exactly that place. I was finally able to talk to a therapist, and to get medication. Nothing seemed to work. I changed therapists, and medications several times. I finally started to feel a little better. Someone recommended guided meditation to me. I thought it was a ridiculous idea. I started and stopped many times. Finally, I committed to practicing it every day ( often several times a day) . Within a few weeks my pattern of thought shifted in a more positive direction. I was told that guided meditation acts on neurotransmitters in the brain to create to new pathways of thought and emotion. It helped a lot. There are many excellent guided meditations for depression on YouTube. It takes very little energy to start. Just search “ guided meditation for depression” on YouTube, select a few, and start. Guided meditation took me on a spiritual journey, which is remarkable because I was a materialist and never believed in a spirit or soul. Once I was in touch with my spiritual side, I found that life had greater meaning. I found purpose. I can’t say I’m always happy, but I’m usually at peace. When you get in touch with a purpose, a reason for being, you are better able to manage distress because the purpose is greater than any mental discomfort. Don’t give up.

The meds help. But sometimes they make it a little harder. For me it was always in waves. I’ve been dealing with my depression for a few years now and understand how you feel. It’s going to take time. But you can heal. Find what makes you happy and hold onto it. Be a guide for others. Yes you can!!!

"Research Study:

**Learning from individuals who experience reductions in suicidal experiences**

Suicide is a worldwide problem. We are interested in finding out what can help people to recover from suicidality, which may help to support others who are experiencing this. We are looking for people who are:

\- Aged 18 or over

\- Live in the UK

\- Have previously experienced suicidal thoughts/feelings/behaviours, but not in the past 12 months 

**Why take part?** 

You might benefit from contributing to research that may inform interventions for people who are suicidal in the future. You may also have an opportunity to pay attention to your strengths, which many crisis models have identified as central to recovery. 

You will take part in a 1 hour MS Teams interview with the researcher. Please email [s.thomas8@lancaster.ac.uk](mailto:s.thomas8@lancaster.ac.uk) for more information!

There are medications and CBT exercises that can be used to change long established behaviors. Some of these medications are also used for anxiety. You may want to talk to a medical professional- if you haven’t already- who can prescribe meds. You can Google “CBT therapy” to get information and training exercises. These can be used in conjunction with therapy. Something else that can be extremely effective is guided meditation. YouTube has guided meditations specifically for skin picking ( you’re not alone), as well as anxiety, depression etc. Just search the terms on YouTube and you’ll find a number of useful meditations. Over a period of time, guided meditation acts on neurotransmitters in the brain to establish new, healthier pathways of thought and action. Guided meditation must be practiced everyday to be maximally effective. If you’re currently being treated and it’s not working, seek new treatments. Too often we keep going with treatments that don’t help. There are many alternative therapeutic approaches to what you describe. Keep searching until you find the treatments that benefit you. Don’t lose hope. You absolutely can overcome this. Persist, and live your best life.	AdCharacter8728	reply	na	na	na	0.9990732669830322	no	no	no	na	depression_help

So I'm changing tablets I'm going to be persistent that I don't wanna stay on these tablets with the doctor's and I wanna try different tablets for it. Your advice means so so much to it and I'm going to do more meditation too as I know how helpful it can be. You've given me hope.

"TLDR: I come from a terrible family, i have had constant trauma, I now suffer from crippling isolation and I really need advice.

Hi everybody just looking for advice here. 
I am 20 years old and completely isolated from any sort of support system, family, or relationship, and everyone says you find happiness when you can learn to be ok being alone. And maybe they’re correct but trying to do it is killing me. 

My mother is a drug addict, who loves me so incredibly much but is so toxic to be around. Every day she texts me at least three times about how much she loves me and misses me, and every text is almost incoherent and love bombing, and I know from experience the moment I text her back she takes it as an opportunity to pour her heart out to me with all the reasons her life is horrible and how at least she succeeded in parenting. 
(I moved out at 15, and out of all 9 of my siblings my little brother is the only one left in direct contact with her at the house. Two of my older brothers are also addicts, and my older sister is an alcoholic) . She is also convinced that my father secretly still loves her and will get back with her any day now. 

I’m the closest to my father but he is a violently homophobic and racist person. He verbatim believes that all trans people are fetishists and all gays are out to miler children. He has told me multiple times that we are at war with the gays and that it’s better to put them out of their misery so at the very least they can’t harm kids. 

This only got worse after he married my stepmother (also an addict because he has a type) a women who attended the Jan 6 insurrection, goes to hospitals to steal morphine and convince patients to pray instead of taking medicine, believes that she can birth the next coming of Jesus, literally worships Mike Lindell the my pillow man, follows q-anon, and lost her children to the care of the state because when my older brother was 5 years old she had a vision he might be gay, so she duct taped him to a highchair and locked him in a closet to then give him an excercisim since then my entire life he has spent his time bouncing between conversion camps, and herion rehab centers. 

If anyone wants proof being gay is not a choice, I unfortunately am not only gay but trans ftm. And I have spent my whole life repressing and hiding any part of it even to myself because of them. 

When I was a kid I was assaulted from the ages of ???? To about middle school which is coincidentally where my memories begin, by an older family friend and my parents never belived me or seemed to care. 

The reason I got out of that was because I started dating my first boyfriend. I was in 8th grade he was in college. My mother set us up. We dated for a year and are still friends today, surprisingly nothing crazy really happend. 

School was incredibly hard for my I was undiagnosed autistic with a terrible home life 9 siblings, no money, and obviously awful in being a women. So I was bullied mercilessly throughout it all.  

The first time I tried to kill myself i was 13.

I was accepted into a friend group for the first time when I got to highschool, my two best friends were a couple that I had got together we’ll say Emma and Ty for clarity sake later, and the love of my life Andy. 

For the first time ever I had friends who I could tell about what was happening, that understood where I was at and actually helped me. I would stay the night at Emma’s as much as I could to avoid being home (and later would move in with her). And the three of them became the only healthy support system I ever had.

But Andy was so special, he was the kindest, loudest, funniest most amazing person I have ever met in my life. I loved him so much it hurt, he was from a similar household (grew up with alcoholic hoarders) and was the first person who truely loved me too. I could talk for hours about him but I’ll save you the details. It was 4 years of the closest friendship I ever had and the most tension filled romance we were to stupid to acknowledge, 

Then he was murdered. 

He was 18, I was 16 and suddenly I had to plan his funeral. I planned his celebration of life, I raised money for his headstone, I helped clean his home and pick his grace. He destroyed me that day. 

Because suddenly I went from having a nonestop conversation at all times, a safe person who loved me and understood me for all my faults, and a drop of the hat best friend and partner in crime, to nothing. 

My parents didn’t even notice I stopped going to school completely at this point. 

The reason Andy and I never dated was because I had gotten locked into an incredibly abusive relationship, mentally sexually and physically. And so had he. 
So goes the story of two fucked up trailer park kids I suppose. I was 16. 

And this put me down a dark path of relationships. 

After Andy died and i dumped the asshole I was with I completely gave up on life, on eating, on sleeping, on caring about anything, which is where I stumbled on Issac a meth addict that I dated when I was 17.

 Things ended because he did cocaine and tried to shoot his dog in front of me as I was semi hostage.  After that I started getting locked out of my parents house, and by the time I turned 18 I was dating my older brothers best friend, Taylor. 

A very kind boy with a safe house where chairs wernt being thrown through the walls and moms weren’t falling/being pushed down stairs. And I felt safe for the first time in a long time. This was about the time I started being able to sleep again without seeing Andy’s corpse every time I closed my eyes, and I learned that if I had someone sleeping with me I didn’t have to be on gaurd. 

Well that didn’t work out because Taylor had undiagnosed schizophrenia and became incredibly possessive over me, along with telling me his plans to murder his family. Which I unfortunately didn’t think was true because I had just gotten away from the meth addict so my perception of normal was skewed. So we broke up as I entered college. 

Untill now Emma and Ty had stuck with me. And I still bounced between Emma and Taylor’s house instead of mine. But Emma had wealthy parents who gifted her and Ty (who had now been together about 4 years) a six bedroom condo to live in during college. The plan was I would live with them but they decided against that and invited In another couple, against my best judgement who then proceeded to destroy their condo, their friendships, their bank account, and there willingness to share the condo. 

So I found a little shithole apartment for myself close to the college, and tried to start making friends.

When I was 19  I came out as trans, and by came out I was outed by Emma who I accidently sobbed to while drunk. And she thought it would “make it easier” if she told everyone for me. 

Which served to alienate me even further from any type of family. Because at school I was out and me and at home I was nothing even close. And suddenly I was living a double life.

Then I was assalted at a party hosted by the most “popular” guy in my college department of around 50 people. He hosted, he provided alcohal, and he tried to fuck me when I was black out drunk. Then he soft blackmailed me into being with him otherwise I would loose all friends and professional notoriety. Then he was reported to title 9 and now I’m in an ongoing assault case that is taking 2 years to settle and deal with. 

Then I turned 20 and the man who assalted me as a child died at fucking 102 of old age peacefully. And my family were pissed I didn’t attend the funeral and half of them no longer talk to me because of it. 

Then Taylor shot himself. It turned out he had planned to murder his family, shoot up a shopping mall and then take his life. But because he was genuinely such a good person he couldn’t bring himself to hurt anyone but himself. Leaving my brother and I to find the body.  He only had five people attend the funeral that were not his family members . Because aparently no one but me knew he was struggling mentally and after we broke up he spiders downwords so much no one even noticed when he made his plans . Turns out I was the only person that knew he even had a gun. (We live rural so this wasn’t that strange at the time) 

Then the title 9 case went public and I lost all college friends and working relationships  because they didn’t want to be associated with the drama of the case. 

Then I started dating my last ex. Kris. Who was older by about 12 years (the smallest age gap I’ve been with was 5 highest 14 so far) and as far i could tell he was the most healthy of a partner I had had since Andy if you could count that. He was polite, he cared about me somtimes, he somtimes let me talk about my problems and to his credit he tired to listen at least somtimes though he wouldn’t mostly zone out .

And then out of the blue he gave up completely on the relationship after 9 months he decided it was too much work and called it off. I realized earlier this week he called it off because he was a trans fetishist, and my life was too hard for him and unsexy. That I wasn’t a boyfriend for him but instead somthing interesting untill I didn’t put out enough and had to much truama so he left. 

Since then Emma and Ty have politely told me that they do not want me calling them as frequently, they don’t want me living with them, and they are tired of the fact nothing ever seems to be good news with me and I can’t blame them because they’re right, and they are allowed to set mental boundaries and I’m happy that they feel comfortable to set them. 

So I agreed without argument. And since then they’ve been happier then ever, they are decorating their free home, they adopted cats, they’re growing strawberries and planning their wedding. 

And I am working 20 hour work days to try and forget that every single time I come home there is no one waiting for me, no one to turn to, and no one that loves me without burdening them. I miss Andy every godamn day of my life, and I’m so tired of waking up from nightmares where I get to see all of the death and abuse of my life play out in stunning 4k resultion. And have no one next to me proving none of it was real. 

I have a therapist and they are wonderful. 
But I can’t keep living like this, knowing that the only person I can talk to is someone I pay to bein my life. 

 In the past year I’ve failed to kill myself twice .

And I’m so so so tired, I don’t know how to get people to care about me and I’ve been on my own for so long. 

This year I’ll graduate college in three years with two degrees, and I currently have a professional resume with three years experience in my feild. And a plan for grad school and beyond with 0 debt so far. 

I have a very successful life despite the odds. 

But what’s the point of working so damn hard  everyday when there’s no one to appreciate it, I can never shake the pain and loneliness in my soul, bettering my life didn’t help in the slightest, and at 20 years old I realize that I have nothing to call home. 

I want to preference that I dont constantly burden people with all of this information, most people I date do not get this full story, and definelty not friends I make. I know better then to constantly rehash tragic backstory on people so I promise im aware of how much of a mental toll dealing with someone like me is. 

And every single time I've felt like this since i was 17 ive downloaded tinder, or some dating app and the cycle just piles all over again.

Don’t do it, things can alway get better and you never know how many other people feel exactly how you do right now. You’re not as alone as you may think friend. Do something that makes you happy, anything. Do what you want to do that brings you happiness and don’t compare your life to someone else’s because we may not know what their life is actually like. Some people are in pain every second of their life and never get relief , take joy and happiness in the little things you do have. You can find them if you look and try , it might be very hard to see it through the darkness but there is always a light in the darkness if you’re still here and trying to reach out to others.

"I'm 32 and in the last 6 months I'm thinking my life is reaching its full course. I'm still living with my family because actually I don't have a job, in the meantime I'm studying Japanese language (I passed the JLPT N5 exam last December) and learning photography. I love art and usually artistic activities kept me in a ""good"" mood. Things have started to change though. I feel I have nothing and no opportunities to emerge and doing something I really want to do in my life. My dream is to go to Japan someday to stay there. My age is against me for everything and I feel like I don't have the time for daydreaming anymore. I feel like I'm locked in a room and the key is lost. Don't wanna live a life working 5-7 / 5-9 doing something sad. Last but not least, my family dont understand who I am and how much sensitive I am about many things. But probably the worst part of the plenty of things I'm feeling is that I'm convincing myself that studying Japanese or photography or doing whatever I'm doing is pointless and useless 'cause the opportunities to build something bigger and lasting won't come. And so I'm struggling with all my activities. Last time I studied was in February. Everyday I wake up feeling empty, I don't wanna talk. I'm not seeing my friends in a long time and I prefer to hang out with myself only. Days are the same, over and over and my energies don't last too much. Sometimes I go to bed early with a breakdown because everything I see in my mind is black and I feel anxiety all over me that the only thing I need to do is be on my own and close my eyes. (I've always been a kind of melancholic and ""sad"" person, but since a year or two things have gotten significantly worse)"	hitodamatron	post	26.114874187111504	female	White	0.9986079335212708	na	na	na	2	depression_help

"I relate to what you're feeling alot and feel like I'm in a very similar situation. 
I feel like the tendency to isolate and not want to speak can come from feeling misunderstood or/and not valued, especially in situations where you feel like people around you don't understand and anything you could say to people is perceived as not really making sense.
If you're in an environment where you're constantly reminded of that you just want to be alone so you stop being saturated in that reflection.
I haven't quite worked out how to differentiate between what's distortion and what's people being genuinely insensitive - but as a fellow millennial creative kind of stuck in a place I feel out of context of too I think one step is to find community with people who understand you and support what you're doing. Whether you can find that in your own locale or online it's really important to find your people so you don't feel like an outsider or a ""freak"" because who you are doesn't align with how others are pursuing their own lives because that feedback loop can really fuck your self worth up.

That confidence does ripple out into your sense of self and ability to sculpt your ideal of how you want to leave your life even when you have to adapt and make compromises.

It's hard though I feel you especially when you're in the self isolation pit, but it sounds like you're an exceptionally capable person if you're able to learn a second language and photography is such an incredible medium to express ideas and experiences. You're still moving forward man, you'll get to where you need to be even if it doesn't make much sense right now.
I will say working a garbage or sad job for a little bit as a means to get towards your actual goal can be a stepping stone, opens you up to potentially meeting like minded people and having that income can give you more options to maybe move to somewhere better while you map out your life's plan to get to Japan.

Sorry if this is a bit rambled but I really hope you're holding up okay and things get alot more lighter and hopeful for you, don't let the world make feel like your life and your dreams are nothing because they are important and I believe you can do it.

You have conditioned yourself into that belief, perhaps unconsciously. Depression arises from thoughts, it has no agency or power beyond what you give to it. As odd as it seems, depression can represent a comfort zone. We’ve been through it so often that it’s predictable, and that predictability brings its own strange form of comfort. You can change your pattern of thinking, and thus integrate the shadow of depression into a healthy sense of self. You can Google “Carl Jung and the shadow self” to find some psychological insights on what you are describing. There are also numerous tools and exercises that you can use to change this belief system about depression and relationships. Two tools used by many therapists are CBT and DBT. If you Google those terms with therapy, you will find information and exercises to help you better integrate the depressive elements of your thinking. These can be used in conjunction with a therapist. Guided meditation is also an exceptionally effective tool to rewire your thinking relative to depression. There are excellent guided meditations on YouTube for depression. If practiced everyday, even on days that you feel it’s not helping, it will slowly change your pattern of thoughts and emotions. It took many years for you to develop, and to ingrain your current thought patterns. It will take time to replace those patterns with healthier ones but it can be done. You are a unique creation you have thoughts, emotions, insights interests, talents, and charisms that are meant to be shared with a hurting world. You can still live your best life, and be a blessing to others. Don’t give up. There is an approach that will help you. Keep trying different methods of better managing your thoughts and emotions. There is definitely something that will help you.	dankthetank26	reply	na	na	na	0.9986677169799805	no	strong	no	na	depression_help
"I'm so full of anxiety and so depressed right now if I don't post I might have a Full breakdown. 

I have been suffering g extra hard from depression and it has caused me to neglect the majority of my home responsibilities. My family isn't complaining, but I feel immensely guilty. I have a husband, a 21 year old autistic son and 18 year old twins living at home with me. My elderly father has dementia and other health issues and needs a lot of support that my mom and the home care provider alone can't handle. The stress is great. 

Anyway, because I can't fulfill all of my duties and responsibilities to this house I feel like a huge burden. Yes my kids work full time and help out with their own stuff. I feel like since I don't contribute financially I'm an even bigger burden. I feel like I would rather die than be this much of a burden.  I can't stand that anyone would need to care for me or pick up my slack. I feel like i should not be moved if I don't contribute financially or physically to the home. I feel my family only loves me to the extent I can assist them or contribute financially to them. We are not very poor but we certainly struggle. Often I feel like I have a duty to die so they can cash in my life insurance. It isn't much but it is like $75,000. Enough for a very cheap funeral and catch them up. I would never consider getting medical treatment for myself outside of an office copay because that is money better spent on the family.  Yes I feel worthless. But then my anxiety because I'm having a hard day makes it worse. I don't have any real friends to talk about this and my husband is also on the autism spectrum and just can't comprehend this. So I keep resolving to never bother him. Yes I have medication"	YarnandPaper-1970	post	32.76967561565061	female	White	0.9984498023986816	na	na	na	2	depression_help

I know how you feel, because I kinda feel the same. I even tried to commit suicide, but paramedics rescued me before it was too late. Even tho I suffer a lot and most of the time I can't think right, I can think very coldly and in a rational way when I do. You should think about using the money to help you get better, because it would an investment for your family: you'll be able to help them sooner, you would give them the cost of having to search for treatment after your death, etc. Think about everyone and think about yourself. I know how hard it is and I think about that really often... I'm also not able to do anything. But we must try to have better days. I'll be cheering for you.

I understand what you mean. I feel like that’s something a lot of people won’t understand. Sometimes it feels like being alone is the only time that feels right. Some can call it being “independent” but steeping out of a comfort zone may help but all people are different. It may be that (like myself) it’s hard to carry burdens thinking that it’s helping but in reality I know it only hurting myself. And I’ll try this too, force yourself once and see how it goes. Often I don’t want to do something strictly out of fear of people digging into  you for “how you're doing”. But maybe it’ll be okay. You don’t know till you try. We’re all more resilient than we give ourselves credit for. You’re not alone in feeling this way, it’s letting go of the unknown is how we find the known right?

"Nothing in my life feels to be going right at this time. 27(m) and my girlfriend of over a year left me last month for a guy she works with. He lives in my apartment complex so I see her car there at his apartment all the time. It hurts like hell.

Hopefully moving in a month but I don’t want to wait a whole month till I can get away. 

On top of that, my roommate/best friend doesn’t make time for me any more. Last time I did anything with him was back in March. I brought this up to him and he said he’s busy with work, and he only sees his gf once a week. I told him that I acknowledge this but he doesn’t even try to hang out with me. Whenever I try to make plans, even over a month in advance, he’s busy with his gf. 

I just feel like I don’t have a place in any bodies life at this moment.

"So I need your guys’ help. 

My life went into a whirlwind for a couple years and professionally I put the pieces back together, but personally, nope. 
 
A year and change back, I made decisions for the direction of my life that didn’t really pan out and it led me to a place where I never expected. I tried to put (some) pieces back together, but obviously it was always in the wrong way, or even the worst way, as if I was self sabotaging. But as I was trying to get my life back together, I was in a horrific crash, and I almost died and I didn’t know how to process certain things. I was already extremely depressed before the accident but then after the accident, I was injured, much worse than I knew and I began trying to fix things in my personal life (in a terrible way) and made it worse and pushed every single person out of my life that I cared about, ending most relationships if not all. I truly thought I was gonna die, and thought I had to say goodbye to everyone. I lied to people, Half heartedly thinking it’s what was best for them, not me. But I just wanted to say goodbye, I refused to tell them the truth of what was really going on and I’ve just been kind of in a daze ever since. I needed something but I didn’t know what. 

The crash that I was in I barely survived, and I didn’t really know why. I hated myself and but even now I can’t seem to get back in a car for long or drive long distances, I am uncomfortable with getting close to people because I’m afraid of screwing everything up and them screwing me up more or because Im a damaged shell of who I was. I lie to people because I’m afraid they won’t have faith in who I am, or I should seem stronger than I am, or to be more of what I think THEY need from me, which is usually the opposite of what they actually want. 

I always used to be straight forward about everything. I never used to do this, but I found something I was so scared to lose and when I did lose that, everything flipped on top of me. I know I’m the problem but Jesus does that suck. People try so hard to get close but I can’t…

I used to know who I was and now I don’t recognize myself. I feel like I’m lost. I try so hard to be what people need and it doesn’t work, but then if I’m myself (actually myself) they run for the hills. I’m truly afraid of who I am because it’s not ever enough.

My life now is fine, I’m surviving, I am in recovery from the accident but I know that in time I’ll find a way to ruin everything over again. I’ve tried to be honest, and that never works, tried lying to myself and others and that doesn’t, but now I’m actually trying to be me and I don’t know who that is, I feel like I’ve got nothing left because I’m truly missing a part of me I used to have but I don’t know what. I’ve been strong before, broken before, but this I haven’t come back (yet 🤞). 

Why can’t I just let go?

Why is it that the things that matter the most are the parts that stay broken? 

How do I fix myself to look at myself in the mirror again?

How do I pretend I’m okay, if inside I’m not?"	Kev_smith34	post	16.029570760002656	male	White	0.9945743680000305	na	na	na	2	depression_help

I don't have any recommendations to make your life or yourself feel better, but if it makes you feel better you aren't alone. I was also in a very serious car accident (died for couple minutes and coma for a month with half a skull serious, incase you're curious lol), and have since lost everything and every person in my life. Now I'm also petrified to let myself even become acquaintances with someone let alone actually friends. I'm scared I can't cope with being left alone for a second time so my brain tells me to prevent it I just need to remain alone. It honestly is awful.

Hey I’m 23M I don’t know how I’ve been feeling recently, I used to have really bad depression but I seemed to move past it and it flairs up every now and then but these last two weeks I don’t know what it is but everything I’ve seen has been depressing, I click on Facebook and watch their shorts sometimes and most of them are just things that make me want to cry and put me in a slump making all these feelings surface. I don’t tend to cry because growing up all I ever did was bottle it, I remember first time I ever cried infront of my girlfriend was all because I was drunk. Then a coworker literally played a song I listened to a long time ago when I wanted to kill myself it was a song by a band called red, but it made me literally ball to the point he asked if I had feelings I’ve never let out. I believe that might be true because sometimes I wonder if my dead family members would be disappointed in me and the person I became, like I think I’m a bad person. Now recently I’ve been trying to change and fix myself be a better person, I’ve stopped watching porn and everything. For some reason I just can’t stop my chest from tightening up on things and I’m scared to let it out because I feel like if I do I’ll fall apart, I’m supposed to be strong for everyone and for myself but it gets so hard sometimes.

The withdrawals sucked for a while, I can’t remember how long tbh. But somewhere around the 3 month mark, I realized I was dancing in the kitchen. And I was so surprised because I hadn’t realized I never danced around while I was on the antidepressants. That made me so sad.

My (18) long distance partner (20) of 2.5 years and I got into a pretty rough fight two days ago. They asked me for some time and space, but it’s been especially difficult to provide that for them considering I have an anxious attachment style and also like to resolve things right away. We usually call to sleep every night but have not for the past two nights. My depression has gotten worse over the summer compared to the school year but has been especially bad over the last two days. I feel especially abandoned, lonely, and unworthy because they are one of — if not the only — source of comfort and support in my life. I have been clean of SH for almost half a year but relapsed two nights ago and again last night. Have also contemplated suicide which hasn’t happened in a long, long time. I feel like I am stupid and overemotional to have this occur over one argument but I just- can’t control it. I want to talk to them, but I don’t even know if they want to. I really miss them. I’m afraid to tell them I relapsed because I don’t want them to be angry with me nor blame it on themself. I’m just reaching out on here to ask for support, or advice, or any kind of help would be much appreciated, thank you.	gummygoomy	post	20.573721028990043	male	White	0.9973795413970947	na	na	na	1	depression_help
"I don't know how long distance partners work.

What is SH?

I guess you are too dependent on the other person and need to let things cool off without having to obsessively talk about it. I had a girlfriend like that before. Not a criticism and just a guess, but she just had a style where she would want to talk endlessly for hours in an emotional way and some personalities cannot handle this.

When she was 21 got pregnant with my sister P by a man who was abusive and a creep, so my mother left him but kept my sister. Then she met her girlfriend and she was with her for a long time but my mother broke up with her because she was doing drugs with her mother. Then she met my dad and my dad is an abusive, childish, and gaslighting man. My dad was mean to my sister p and baby trapped my mother, and lied about his age and she found out that she was ten years older than him.

Then with my sister P, she was with a guy that our family made to feel like he was a part of our family. Then they got engaged? But after 10 years together he cheated on her and left her with a baby.

Hey! Listen, I might not know exactly what you are going through but one thing is clear, if you daily exercise, even as mediocre as a 30 min walk, it will improve your mood slightly, and over time that will compound. I feel you, I’m unemployed and also have no idea what to do with life, I’ve been depressed for years but since I joined the gym, and really struggled to go everyday, it dramatically improved my mood. Lifting weights + walking helps a lot. Taking care of yourself helps a lot.

"Dear all, (TLDR below)

My wife has been struggling with a burn-out and depression for the past two years. She has tried different anti-depressants and she has had a therapist but quit as she felt the sessions became repetitive. Her burn-out symptoms have gradually become better and she has gone back to work 50%. This may have been a bit ambitious; she is managing but it is not easy.

Her depression stays the same however. For the last half year she has kept therapy out of the question as she felt the new anti-depressant might change things. Also she tells me that therapy takes a lot of energy which she cannot spare. 

Of course I see her struffling and I want her to get the help! But whenever I mention going back to therapy I always back off quickly, as she seems to interpret this as pressure from me that she has to get better. Which makes her feel worse of course. I want to be a source of happiness and not hurt, but I am also very worried that this way she is not getting the help she needs.

Yesterday she got so fed up however with feeling miserable she told me I could look for a therapist. I am now doing research and trying to contact the right people. Are there any tips as to what kind of therapy is more effective than others? I can see so many terms online: conversational therapy, psychotherapy, eye-movement desensitization and reprocessing, cognitive therapy, systems therapy, to name a few. Are there big differences between psychiatrists, therapists and coaches? We also have a horse-therapist closeby, she loves horseriding but I don't know if this is a serious way to treat depression? 

Long story short: does anybody have any helpful tips so I can maximize the chances of success for this second attempt at therapy?  


TLDR: my wife has been severely depressed for two years, it started several months before she got a burn-out. She has found therapy not too helpful in the past. She has made progress in tackling the burn-out. But she keeps saying that therapy for her depression takes more energy than she has to spare. Now, she wants to try again, not because she has more energy but because she's fed up. Im trying to get her the right type of help. But what should I look for to maximize chances of succes?

"I felt wing waving and hypnosis actually helped me- i didn’t know much about hypnosis but it wasn’t as spacy as i thought. We talked and we worked on letting go old believes that come back subconsciously. 
Also a change of diet and a calming but steady routine. Much sports without competition and lots of mindfulness ,- maybe a retreat could also be helpful!"	SatisfactionNo6651	reply	na	na	na	0.9456930160522461	no	strong	no	na	depression_help

"Am male, 31, chronically single, never had a girlfriend. I’m in good shape, am outgoing with many friends, I’m part of various clubs & hobbies such as; swing dancing, gym, kickboxing, rock climbing, canoeing & meet-up groups. 

Throughout all of this, I am unable to find anyone attracted to me, many times with the words “Hell no, he’s ugly!” being used. One time at a party I was described as “alright…. but only from the neck down” by a woman when she thought I wouldn’t hear. So you might say, looks are a problem.

However, when I talk to my friends, particularly the female ones, they will swoop in with platitudes such as: “Oh don’t worry, you’ll find ‘The One’ really soon!” and talk about how it’s only realistic that anybody my age will already have kids and want to settle down.

Problem is, that’s not what I want, and I never said it was.

I do believe that, because I’m ugly, people will jump to the conclusion that I just want to marry the first woman who slips me the tongue, and spend the rest of my life like that. It’s not like that at all. I want the fun years, like how all my other friends spent their 20s; you date someone, it doesn’t work out, date someone else for a year, you go abroad together, go wild and it’s all carefree. Then after several years of doing that, they eventually found the people they decided were worth settling down with etc. They seem to think that I want to skip past all the fun years, and go straight to changing diapers and mortgage payments, and it’s infuriating.

The idea that nobody wanted me throughout my 20s, but now I have to settle for a 35yr old with 2 kids, who’s already had her fun years, and is just looking for the next schmuck to raise her children, because the hot guy she picked ran out on her…. it’s just not what I want out of life. The idea that’s the best I can hope for, generally makes me want to Jill myself."	MysteriousTelephone	post	31.128329121998764	female	White	0.998730480670929	na	na	na	6	depression_help

"I don't think what you described as the ""ideal"" or rather ""normal"" progression of things with people in the 20s is that normal at all. But maybe that's just me who always kinda just strived for both of those worlds combined in every relationship I had. 

I know which sub we're on, but I'd like you to know that it doesn't have to be that bleak in your 30s (I think your view was pretty bleak and it gave off a ""there's no other way"" impression) even if you do end up spending a few years with just one person. They could very well be both fun, passionate, spontaneous, independent and genuinely caring for you a tad more than a hook-up would. 

Of course, that probably isn't for you, much like how just hook-ups aren't for me - or just puppy love and codependency (I'm terrified of that word, really). I just end up feeling like something's missing. You know yourself though.

By all means, if you want to experience your young years that way, get advice from close pals - ask them to be blunt when you feel they could actually help you but they give you cliches instead. Y'know, talk about best locations to know people locally, spice up your profiles if you use any, spice up your interests and meet people that way - all that. Events, what have you. Also, age is just a number and there weren't interesting people I've met who didn't agree with that - so what you were a ""late bloomer"" by what's-his-face's' standards? Don't stress.

People over 25 tend to change their views on life a lot and I find they're more accepting of whatever really. And if you've been friends for just a bit, they won't dismiss you. I hope. You should know if that's the case with your people. As for dates, a lot more comes down to timing, right person, right time, I'm sure you know this. It doesn't hurt to spend some time figuring out what you could do or learn to get people interested (the type of people you want to attract, of course).

I myself don't feel like settling down just yet so I can relate to your post here - I honestly hope you get to live your best life soon!"	MysteriousTelephone	reply	na	na	na	0.998730480670929	no	strong	no	na	depression_help

"I suppose from my end, it does feel bleak. When I was in my 20s, and people my age were having wild and free relationships, I was left out of the party. Now in my 30s, people my age have had those wild years, and just want to settle down, it does feel bleak. It leaves me with the options of getting into a relationship I don't want to be in, or being that weird older guy chasing 22 year old girls, and I don't want to be that guy. 

I wouldn't mind a hookup, just the validation of someone finding me attractive would be nice. It's just bizarre to me that I will explain that to my friends, and they just project their aims/dreams onto me, and are surprised when I have to tell them that it's not what I want."

"It doesn't seem that hard to understand, to me - so you definitely shouldn't take this as someone *everyone* on this planet won't understand or that *everyone* will be surprised and either judge you for your wishes or whatnot. You might just want to try looking for people who share your mindset right now (which is not immature, nor anything - it's just your life). Those who tell you what you should want probably are too high on that horse, thinking they definitely are doing the right thing - they're just doing the right thing for them and aren't being very empathetic. 

I think it's the same kind of feeling that pushes friends away, once one of them settles down and becomes (understandably) more involved with their children and a certain routine, the other single friends don't necessarily want to talk about children all day, so their interests become different and they either drift apart or stop spending that much time together - no more brunching haha

I'm approaching my 30s, I don't feel I've partied my a$$ off in my 20s as I was rather interested in whatever I was studying. I enjoy my hobbies, I enjoy talking about them, music, concerts, film, it doesn't matter to me if I go alone to those. It might just be my character - but I have friends who are the same way and friends who are absolutely crushed if they were to be sent to the cinema alone, haha. I ramble, but what I want to say is, in the view you suggested above, you might consider I wasted my 20s when I certainly don't feel I have. And when you look from the outside at someone's life who seems to have ""partied all through the 20s"" maybe they just always wanted to find that person to settle down with and didn't particularly enjoy being thrown around, not knowing how to find their ideal partner who would want to commit and so on - maybe they feel like they've wasted their 20s but you think they ""had it good"".

People might also tell you different things, just to make themselves feel better, even if they're not true. It can be extremely complicated and that's why older folk advise youngsters to not dwell on what others are doing and just go their own paths. I'm not saying I'm the best at following that advice myself haha, but it sure helps keeping it in mind. 

The future is also terribly hard to predict, so even more reason to focus on your own wellbeing. If that's acknowledging that you might be dwelling too much on x issue rather than trying to live, I think it's worth a shot to address that. 

All the luck! Go out, have fun! :)"	MysteriousTelephone	reply	na	na	na	0.998730480670929	weak	no	no	na	depression_help
"I am a junior doctor currently working in a small clinic. I have anxiety and depression for 11 years for which i am on therapy and antidepressants. As a doctor i will always be a student and i have to study books constantly.
But the problem itself is studying. I don't exactly know what happens but my anxieties (social anxiety specially) is triggered by me studying (memorizing/rote learning stuff specifically) books. This was a trigger for the mental health issues i was diagnosed with 11 years ago in the first place. This has been effecting every aspects of my life since then. I am trying to understand this for years now but still haven't find any explanation. Its like the analytical part of my brain has some sort of association with my anxieties. The words or sentences i read (try to memorize) gets repeated in my mind subconsciously which makes me suffocated and its difficult to fall asleep and i keep waking up in the middle of the night with these words repeating themselves. I have no control over it. Just memorizing or rote learning stuff activates my social anxiety which manifests as me unable to make eye contact with people and thereby affecting my social life. All of this triggers panic episodes, depression, insomnia and the cycle keeps repeating until i take a break from studying all together. 

When i don't study, things are little better. My social anxiety gets manageable. I can make eye contact with everyone easily.
I am less Restless and overall better. 
Can someone please explain to me what is the reason for this."	Schadenfreude1091	post	35.01887843543376	male	White	0.9947814345359802	na	na	na	2	depression_help

"Probably some kind of trauma from having to memorize the prodigious amounts of crap that is expected from doctors. I don't have a quick fix, but I think that one of the most difficult and important things to learn for people helping others with serious problems is how to be selfish as a survival mechanism.

I have social anxiety so I am in my early twenties and I don't have a single friend who I can talk too. The only people who know me are my family. I would like to believe that I am doing a lot better now as I am gradually starting to go out, but I feel as lonely with them as I feel at home. How do I connect to anyone who I think are nice people without coming out as clingy or weird? Sometimes I don't even like to try because I have faced social rejection before, and it wouldn't be a stretch to say that it was painful. So I feel I don't need social interaction but then I get this feeling of loneliness in my gut .	Apprehensive-War-554	post	27.999323222623083	male	White	0.9987764954566956	na	na	na	5	depression_help

"Perhaps there’s two things you could look at. How you might be able to have better conversations with people. And how you might learn to get comfortable with the feeling of loneliness. 

As far as having better conversations and connections. In the simplest way, it’s a skill you can learn. Some are natural social butterflies sure. But for most of us, not so much. There’s a ton of awesome videos on youtube about how to have better conversations or connections. One of my favorites I’ve learned is just asking people questions about themselves can create an hours long conversation. People love to talk about themselves. And if you want to befriend them you’ll want to know about them. So asking open ended questions is a good place to start. Ya social rejection can happen. It’s ok. We can’t let past experiences hold us back from going out and trying again. 

You mentioned at the end the feeling of not needing social interaction but feeling lonely. We all need some type of social interaction. It’s who we are as humans. So ignoring that tends to bring this uncomfortable level of loneliness about. It’s a balance. Going out and having some social interaction. Then learning to be ok with spending time alone as well. Perhaps this feeling in your gut is telling you it’s time to try and get out more in the world. You never know how many amazing people there are out in the world until you try.

Don't say that. Never lose hope. Going out more than before (if I even went out in the first place) has been truly tough on me, to the point when I started to wonder if living in solitude was really a bad option.

"I think I just survived my first major existential crisis. It came about with depression episodes (distorted reality, emotions all over the place, anger, fear, isolation) and all I could think to do was spend my free time on youtube, fueling my anxiety, watching cancer fighters' (and survivors' - or not) vlogs and internal battles. I was not going through any medical condition myself - aside from maybe some self-inflicted stomach issues now resolved, caused by months of inactivity, sleeping all day, eating more sugar, caffeine, drinking almost no water and so on... 'soft' drugs, let's say, but plenty. My health anxiety was through the roof even as I was abusing my own body, scared of the consequences, but not able to control my coping mechanisms, relapsing and so on. Dull view on life for many many months, constantly afraid myself or my loved ones would soon go through terrible pain - probably because we have been going through a major pandemic that has affected our family deeply.

This past week I've been feeling those dark clouds dissipate. I'm not back to my former self, I haven't seen that person in 2 years - maybe more. I'm hoping to become better at asking for help, picking the better coping mechanisms, maybe talking about it more (like I'm trying to do now - in whichever form). 

I'm just here to say without a doubt everyone goes through something like this - maybe some are affected by it more than others. I've heard people who I would deem successful talk about this openly - such as Jason Segel. He said he's been affected by it throughout his life and he looked at it as ""I just need to put a little more effort towards my happiness than some people"", reassuring there's nothing wrong with it, and acknowledging the struggle. Most people I've met tend to think that way, rather than stigmatise you.

Hell, even Barbie asked this question in the middle of a great party - that one really took me by surprise. 

I guess that introspection isn't usually that bad - deciding which aspect of death is most terrifying, or if it is terrifying at all so you can discover your way of coming to terms with it - and maybe finding an aid to inspire what you could do with your life.

If it's something you think of as a solution or an escape card, well here on this subreddit you go and you'll be found my mostly kind intenet people who'll tell you why that's not necessary or worth daydreaming about."

They are strict, over protective, possessive, and almost dictators, the “NO” parents, where everything they say is an obligation and everything I want to do have to pass them first, making our relationship weird, awkward and mainly with out trust, and they kinda have a point since I live with them with out paying nothing( that is what they say), but because of that they make me look like the perfect child, “for my future” as they say, everyone thinks that I’m perfect although I’m not. Because of that I aged in a house where I could not say that I was having any problem, in school as homework, or bullies( I kinda solve it my self), by the way, my parents make bullying with me and my 2 younger siblings, and mainly in life, that’s why I grow up with out carrying about my emotions and feelings,because my parents don’t share them too, and so I created a personality that don’t like anything and don’t love no one, and the more I think about it more I come in the conclusion that I don’t deserve anything even my life ( I will not kill my self, just to make clear, I’m not that stupid, it hurts right? ).

"**TMI for anyone who really hates talking about pee.**

Anybody have any issues with controlling their bladder after using duloxetine? I've struggled with being consistent with medication so this is the first time in about 2 years that I've taken my meds consistently. I went cold turkey without my meds two weeks ago for about 9 days because I didn't pick up my prescription. When I got it refilled, I was pretty consistent with taking it every day since then.

I've been having a lot of trouble controlling my bladder since I've been on the medication. I noticed it around the same time that I started the meds, but because I stopped taking them not long after I started, I can't tell what caused the issue. Was it taking the meds themselves? Was it going cold turkey on them? Was it going cold turkey COMBINED with taking them consistently again?

For context, I'm 23 years old, AFAB, considered obese (at least by BMI, even though BMI's kinda bullshit, but the context is there for info). I guess I'll mention that I'm east Asian since sometimes meds can affect different races in other ways.

I've been in a new city for almost a year and I finally have to bite the bullet and switch off of my pediatric PCP because I turned 23 this past year. I've never had issues with this before so I don't know what this is, and I really need to do something about it soon because I peed myself in public today because I couldn't hold it. It was extremely embarrassing and I really don't want it to happen again, which is why I'm hoping I can get to the bottom of it soon."	floatingarray	post	40.66699080728394	male	White	0.9893073439598083	na	na	na	3	depression_help

hey everyone this is what I'm asking help for. I recently found out that my bf has serious depression issues and a lot of unresolved childhood trauma(mom). I've been through some similar issues as him and I've overcome them, the issue is he is only 26 an I am 33 so Ive had more time to process my issues and come up with a solution. I try and give him advice even when he has his episodes to try and break him out of it, I've even tried ways he has suggested but for the love of god he just cant break out of it. It in turns gets me upset and feel helpless. Because I don't like to see him in that state. When e first started showing signs of depression he could manage it better but as time has gone on he cant control his emotions. When we are good, he is fine. But when we manage to talk over situations and I began to let him know how I feel about things, it upsets him and he gets defensive and makes me feel as if I was out of line. I know he wants me to just be there and understand but it is becoming stressing and I have no clue of what to do to help him anymore. Someone please help me out!

This coming from a compassionate stand point . Now if you have tried all you can to help him then there has to be a limit of how much you can help him. You have to think of yourself first . It’s not selfish but if his problems drag you down my best advice is to you is help yourself first before trying to help someone else	KayJQween	reply	na	na	na	0.9973791837692261	weak	no	no	na	depression_help
"My sweet angel Marie was 14 and a half yesterday. She was the center of our universe. My wife and I rescued her 11 years ago when we got married. She was a abused little pug who they found bleeding under a bridge and was too afraid to bark or even make a sound. She had the world's biggest heart and we all just clicked together. We instantly became a family for the first time.

Since then we fell in love. Our pug was our best friend, our baby, our child, our other half. We said this was our perfect family. Nothing could make any one of us happier. We told her she was my wife's true soul mate. We shaped our lives around how to better accommodate her as she got older and had more health problems. Truly the center of our happiness and our universe. Our every single day revolved around taking care of her and loving her. We see her as our literal child. My wife and I suffer from severe depression and the only reason either of us are still alive is because of our little angel. 

Her deterioration happened so fast and next thing we knew she was having more bad days then good. I tried so hard to convince myself this perfect family will last forever and it'll never change. For a second there I think I even believed my own delusion and told myself this happiness will never end. 

Suddenly we had a week left. Until ""the day"" we take her to the vet for the final time. We knew it was time, we never wanted it to be but we knew it was. We promised our baby we would always be there for her and take care of her. In terms of what's best for her and how could we possibly take care of her any more, this was the right decision. It's what was best for her. But it destroyed us to make that decision. 

That last 7 days.. it was the worst 7 days of my life. But we made sure that it was her best 7 days. Our baby had the perfect week, we did everything we possibly could do to make sure she was happy. It was the most I had seen her smile and be happy in months. Truly her perfect week. She couldn't of been happier. It destroyed us. On day 7, it was just tears and hugging all morning until her appointment. We stayed there with her til her last breath.. I will never have that sight leave my mind. The moment I realized she had stopped breathing is seared into my brain. In that moment my whole world darkend. My heart dropped. I had never felt a pain so incredibly deep in my heart before. I can't stop thinking about that moment. 

When we finally calmed down a little and enough to drive, we got home and sat in front of our apartment. The dread hit again. Never in our entire Marriage did we have to come home to our baby not being there. Walking in and being home. Everything around me, everywhere I looked, I saw her. She truly was our entire world and the only bright light in our life. For the first time my home looked empty, dark, lifeless. There was a huge part of my world and my heart that no longer existed in the same space as me. It hurts. Everything I did, everytime I stood up and went to a different room, everytime there is a pause in conversation i looked around. We began to notice how many mannerisms we picked up that involved our baby. Nothing. Absolutely nothing is the same anymore. 

Around dinner time I stood up ""as if to make our dog's dinner"" and just stood there. I didnt know what to do. My world was slowly collapsing around me. I looked to my wife for comfort and all I saw was a numb empty shell of a woman. The despair of her face was that of someone who had just lost their soul mate. The love that I shared with our baby was more then I could even comprehend. My wife had a even deeper connection to our baby. They were exactly alike. They did everything together. We always said that they were created to be together. I know that what she was feeling is a thousand times more than the pain I feel. Seeing my wife like this is now the second worst thing I've seen in my life. My heart has never been this broken. 

We have a cat that we got a couple years ago to help with our baby's anxiety while we were at work. The cat helped her a ton and kept her company. But now everytime I look at the cat she looks lost. She keeps looking for her sister. She keeps waiting and starring at the door. I've never seen a cat look sad before. She wouldn't play or do any of her normal things. She just keeps waiting for her sister to come home. It's breaking my heart so much. 

I need help. I need advice. How do I go on from here? How do I deal with the center of our lives being gone? How do I make this home feel like home again? How do I cope with this darkness that now resides over my life? Our little light is gone and now I feel so lost. My wife pulled me back up once already but I feel like i keep falling into deep despair. The entire point of everything I did everyday, working hard at my job, pushing myself to do better, fighting my depression, it was all for her and her happiness. So what's the point now shes gone? There is no longer a light that guides me, a flame of hope and happiness that I work to protect. How am I supposed to keep living with this pain. Please, lend me your advice. It's only been one day. I woke up this morning without a single ounce of happiness left. I can't live like this. I need help."	timonium808	post	31.417532541202007	male	White	0.014541160315275192	na	na	na	2	depression_help

"Sorry about your loss. I feel your pain. I guess if it were possible, you could have done anything to keep your baby alive. Please take heart because what happened was inevitable and nothing can be done to undo it.

""The day"" is going to come for every living loved thing. And every human has this hollow longing to be filled. Marie filled yours. Loved ones fill it for some. Achievements fill it for others. For some, they fill the hollow with Addiction.

 It's saddening because temporary things are what they are, they leave, and the hollow becomes empty and void.

The permanent solution to filling the hollow is to let God fill it through his son, Jesus. He is the light that lights up our darkness. He is the lasting source of happiness.

I always find the worst thing to say. The worst thing to do. In every situation it’s like I think out my actions and words so hard and still when I say them it doesn’t go right. Like no matter what I do I’ll always end up curling up alone at home instead. I don’t want to go out anymore. I just want to beg people to come in. I’ve lost all my hobbies. Had a complete change in job and friends. Yet nothing changes. I’m the common variable here. No one else is a constant in this situation. It’s me. Why am I so wrong? I think I’m a good person, I care about people I try to go the extra mile. I give and give and give. But somehow I’m stepped on at the end of it all. I still fail. I ask myself what the fuck is wrong with me all the time. More than once a day. I can’t stop imagining so many things happening to me or to be done to myself. I just wish I would go away. But I provide for lives I can’t just go. But I feel like I should. I just want to know what the fuck is wrong with me. I can’t just be a curse there has to be something. But I don’t feel that I’ll ever fit in with anyone or any group or any hobby. Nothing is getting better. Just harder. I don’t know what to do. I can’t institutionalize myself.

"I have been in a bad way for several years. I am on medication for depression and adhd now, but I still struggle. The past couple months have been brutal. There are no significant changes in my life 
The last couple of months, but I have this empty feeling. Loneliness and the feeling like I am a horrible person. I am married, have 4 kids, one of which has graduated high school. There is no reason to be lonely, other than having no friends. I say I have no friends, but I do. They aren’t very close friends, though, because I basically just can’t bring myself put myself out there. My wife, though, she is a saint. I know that I am a burden on her because I’m ALWAYS wanting sex but the medication makes it hard to, well, get hard. The pain of feeling like I let everyone down is immense. I am a diesel mechanic working for my parents at thier truck shop. I am eventually going to take over the business from my parents when they retire. That scares me. Everyone I work with tell me I’m a great mechanic and that I will be a great boss, but through my eyes I don’t see that I am good at all. The sucky thing is, I cry over this crap all the time, but the other part of me says that I am just a stupid crybaby for making myself think of that stuff, which in turn makes me feel even worse. I just needed to put this out there and see if any of your redditors have been through similar things and can give me advise. Thank you."

"How do I go on?

(English is not my native language, so sorry if I'm unclear in my explanation)

I (man, 42 years old) have never posted anything on Reddit but I feel lost and don't know how to carry on with my life. I'm hoping for some kind of advice. Not looking for pity or karma with my story.

I'll try to keep this short. 
I have had an abusive childhood. Both physical and psychological. The one that caused this was my stepfather. I just recently found out that the man who raised me is actually my stepfather. I immediately started a search for my biological father. I'll spare you the details of this search to keep my story short as possible, but I have found my father. He was deceased in my birth year, but not by natural causes.
My father was brutally murdered by my stepfather.

Since I know this terrible family secret, my life seem to be spiraling down to hell. I'm depressed, suicidal from time to time and none of the medication seem to be working. (This has been this way for six years now) I'm about to lose my job due to my depression and my marriage is hanging by a thread.
I'm lonely because it's hard to maintain social contacts due to my depression. So basically I've lost all of my friends.

I'm trying to put things in perspective, with the help of several therapists but none of the treatments seem to be helpful. I don't know what to do to turn my life around again. 
Advice would be great. Again, I'm not looking for pity or attention with my story, but I'm desperate."	Unhappy-Tale8216	post	35.4415645797661	female	White	0.9966309666633606	na	na	na	4	depression_help

"What does it subjectively feel like to you when you are isolating from people during depression episodes? 

For me it it is the feeling of inadequacy. That I am an impostor that has been tricking everyone into thinking they are a happy normal person. And now i have to hide my true depressed melancholic self so they dont find out. Even though they know already im not normal.... I can never shake these feelings off, I always think I will ruin all my relationships because my sadness sucks the air out of the room. My brain doesn't believe people when they tell me they love me and support me no matter what. There is an additional level of not wanting to thwart their expectations of me getting better. Makes me want to isolate even more... it is constantly frustrating and demoralizing

This is pretty much me, except I do work... And I actually enjoy work and the socialization it brings. I'm going through a divorce and although I'm genuinely happy about it, I've definitely isolated myself and cut myself off from everyone in my life besides my Dad and my kids.

I cry again reading this. Why does this hurts so bad??? I know i needed help. I cant keep pushing people away for every emotional breakdown i had. But then again i dont have the courage to even ask for help. I couldn't let them know how pathetic i have become. A pathetic disappointment. I tried to reach my hands out for help but deep inside me I know there is no one who can truly understand me. There is no one to hold my hands.  I pretend to be strong to those who need me.

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Hey,could you start by doing small things? Even if it takes you a bit of time, Like maybe trying to get up and going to get something to eat and a warm drink or something that lifts your mood up and watching something on TV or listening to some music you love . Obviously I know it's never as simple as how others can just tell you to do this. But once you have made that step that's an achievement and the more you keep making those steps you will get through this. Either way I'm hoping for the best for you. I'm not amazing at advice but I just thought I should give it a go and let you know I'm proud of you. You've got this.

"To me, if you can't will yourself to get out of bed, it sounds like you are severely depressed. Does it feel like your limbs are really heavy or you need to focus a lot just to be able to move?

I've been there. It sucks and I'm sorry you're feeling this way.

What got me out of there was a combination of medication and therapy. I got the medication from a psychiatrist, not a GP, and the therapist is teaching my CBT. I did have to try a few different therapists before homing down on one, and a few different doctors too. It did take some time for everything to kick in.

My severe depression has gotten so bad to the point I’ve given up on my doing work for my remote job. I attend work meetings to show up with my camera off. Luckily my manager doesn’t micromanage, most of the days I put my slack notification to active and not actually working because no one dm me throughout the day anyways. This job, my life is no longer exciting to me. I lost interest and passion in everything there is life to offer. No one texts or call me anymore. No one cares about me. This life is not worth living.

But im still here crying in my bed questioning everything. Is this my selfish self trying to find excuses for all this horrible feelings?? I keep thinking of ending it all. Maybe then i will be at peace. I keep thinking about it but i know i dont have the guts to do it. I wish i can end it all with mg own hands. But i cant. Im just too weak. Hopeless. I know there are others who love me. But im still alone. This feelings never went away. I tried so hard to push this feelings away. But i cant. Its hard to even breath. Its hard to hold this tears. I dont want people to see me like this. Vulnerable. Weak. How i wish someone can pull me out of this hell. This living hell. I know its a futile hope. No one can see me behind this walls.

"Its hell, plain hell. Im sitting right now surrounded by family. I have a few good friends. Im intelligent, have my health... Nothing matters. I want to die and be done with it all. If someone were to come and hug me, and try to support, all id want is for them to leave me be, regardless off how hopeless I feel.

What im getting at, is that so far, and im 30 years old, my conclusion is that it makes no sense. Its just a gaping void, like a cancer of thought. No use in reasoning with it, running away is useless, same goes for drugs and food and self destruction. You just gotta eat it, all of it, all the blackness and oozing misery that comes with it, its as real as the air you breath and theres no getting around it. 

But it goes away. I know, believe me, it doesnt seem like it, and right now, at the bottom of the pit, im looking back and every good moment from my past has lost all meaning and just feels like another sick joke. But thats just one more part of it. This will end too, and a new wind will blow and life will go on and change, as they always do. Theres no stopping its momentum.

"Hi there.  Im sorry to hear of the pain youre going through.  All my life i felt the same way and still today at times i have to fight it. I would cry to my mom when i was little. Everyone would make fun of me because i wasn't like them.  I would self harm a lot because it helped the pain.  One day,  i lost my job, found out i had all these disabilities, and my ex left me.  It was a matter of time when i felt done with everything.  One day my self harm went to far. My sister found me on the floor and she wanted to take me to the hospital.  I refused. She helped clean me up and the mess and  put me in bed.  Next day my parents took me to the doctor.  Mom starts crying and crying and said ""how could you be so selfish and do this?  How can you think your family doesn't care? "" she went back to crying.  I really did feel selfish.  For me, one of the worse feelings is to disappoint my parents.  I knew i needed help.  I was put on meds and i had doctors to talk to.  I suffered from severe depression with bipolar.  Maybe you can talk to your parents or even talk with a counselor?  My friend, im not sure your religious beliefs are but would it be okay if i say a prayer for you?  If not,  its okay to delete this.  I will keep you in my heart and in prayers.  I send you big hugs, hope,  love and encouragement. 

Dear Father, you are our hope and our strength. Thank you for my friend here.  She has a kind soul,  and needs your loving guidance. Father, i speak hope and healing into my friend. Nothing is impossible with you so i know you can help my friend.  When we are constantly looking down at ourselves,  you are the mighty one that lifts our chin.  Help my friend to look up at you, and may your face shine down upon her.  Father, i also speak joy into my friend as well as strength.  Give her the strength to fight this and show her the joy that's there.  I ask you Father to place her under the shadow of Your wings and give her Your comfort.  Heal her while she is in your arms. Father i also ask that you hold my friend's hand and let her feel your love. Heal her Father so she can receive and send the love she has within her. Father, heal her heart,  soul and mind.  Let her find the joy and peace that she seeks and help those she loves to understand all that she is going through.  You said if i ask anything in your name, i will receive it. So i ask in Jesus' name to please heal the pain she's going through and give her the love and joy she deserves.  Thank you for listening to my prayers.  I love you and thank you.

"I know this place so well and I’m so deeply sorry you feel this way.. it is trielt hell and so alienating and isolating.. 
I am still recovering from a really severe depressive episode and I hope it’s okay to share some things that helped me and still keep my head over water. 

- structure: small things that frame my day. Walks, yoga, sitting outside. It feels senseless and as if you are doing it for someone else but eventually might provide some ground to find a new perspective

- accepting/grieving: I think I allowed myself to cry and feel self pity for at least one month as much as I want, I isolated myself, ate unhealthy junk food, cried so much, screamed, grieving for everything that I don’t have but long so much for.. not trying to resist it

- writing things down: helps to get things out of my mind, to sort things and also if i recover from an episode and maybe at some point go through another episode I reread esp the things I wrote in recovery because it is a prove that things can change and will change and already changed. Hopelessness that it will ever be different is one of the hardest things in depression.. this helps me a lot to not give up. No feeling is final, it won’t be like this all the time!

- trying to learn to see different shades and nuances to complex life situations. Life is not coherent, and I want to share my favorite clarice lispector quote: „Coherence, I don't want it any more. Coherence is mutilation. I want disorder. I can only guess at it through a vehement incoherence.“
It helped me to accept that even though everything is breaking apart and feels senseless and empty that there *can* still be some small good things I can enjoy, even though through a veil. 

- Allowance: most important thing!! I *allowed* myself to feel connections, to reach out, to be vulnerable. I stopped the resistance against it and opened up to the possibility that it might happen. Went hand in hand with learning to see shades instead of everything black and white. The moment I allowed myself to let things happen changed things fundamentally!


My friend I really hope you might also allow yourself to let people in. There are already people who love you and that is already being connected with them, even if it maybe doesn’t feel like this yet. I’m sure that would also help the people around you a lot even though I can understand that it might be scary.

Everything seems hopeless. I tried every single day to make it a little bit less suffocating. But it never ends. I do tried my best. I tried everything to make myself feel a little bit better. So that i can love myself a little bit more. But this suffocating feelings never went away. Tears wasted on my pathetic self until there's none left. I wish i had someone.. i really wish for even just one soul to look at me and listen to me. But im still here feeling lonelier than ever. This rant is my pathetic way of trying to make it better. Just maybe i can find the strength and courage i need to keep on living. Even if it is from strangers that i may never even meet in this life. I had tried to write this all out. But then all those writings just make me pity myself even more. Making me feel like im a pathetic human being. I tried to atleast do one thing to make myself feel better everyday. But all it does is leaving me feeling more exhausted than ever. One day i feel better about myself. But the next day all i could feel is as if the whole world had collapsed on me. I tried to accept this fate, accept my whole being and everything that comes with it. I tried to put some meaning on this useless self. But i never find the way out of this hell.

Where I live (NJ, USA) the minimum is usually 72 hours.  I don’t know if it differs elsewhere.  I was told the average stay of an acute hospitalization is usually 5-7 days however when I went I was usually held for 10 days.  It depends on your needs though.  If you need help to stay safe please go to the hospital.  About a week being held isn’t much at all compared to your lifetime.  A social worker at the hospital may be able to refer you to something after you leave as well which could be helpful.  Please stay safe and I hope you feel better soon.

If you love them, you are most definitely not committed to do the act.  I have my twins like i said that stops me. Maybe your family and friends and your love for them might be strong enough to change your mind.   Maybe there's someone like your family and friends that you can talk to that will give you strength and give you hope? I almost took my life many years ago before i had my kids.  It was unsuccessful because my sister found me on the floor. She helped clean me and the floor up.  I refused to go to the hospital but my parents took me doctor the next day.  My mom  crying and crying.  She called me selfish and said i didnt love them.  When i was doing the act,  i thought of no one except getting rid of me. My friend you dont have to. If you were here, i'd hug you and not let you go. My friend, my heart sends you love and hope for another day. Maybe you can do just a short check in with your doctor?

"Hello I am here becauce I have no idea what i can do.
My friend and i are both in our early to mid twenties and he has been struggling for years and right now he is going deeper then i have ever seen or heard about. 
He just opend up to me about the last 3months that really shocked me cause in my eyes it looked that it got a little better.
I don't feel like it is my place to give details about what exactly he has done but I still hope some of u are able to give me some advice.

So now for my questions
-would it be alright for me to push myself on to him? Taking him for a walk in the park calling him to sheck in.
-is it a good idea to try to talk to his therapis so he/she couldn't tell me what to do?
-right now life is going good for my both work and private. could this be bad? Like in a way that this could harm him?that he would resent himself more because I chove my 'good' life in his face by trying to help him.

These are the 3 things that go around in my head right now so if you have an answer to one or maybe something else to say i would really like to hear it"	definetlynotamimic	post	22.630992900310776	male	White	0.9855323433876038	na	na	na	1	depression_help

I've been on antidepressants/anti anxiety medication (sertraline) since November 15th last year I don't know why I remember the exact date but I do. I noticed a change in my anxiety during the 50mg and then when it was upped to 100mg however it hasn't really had much of a positive affect on my depression and struggling with that amongst other things. It was upped to 150g a while back and I still haven't had an improvement. Plus I've got an appointment soon with the doctors to discuss changing tablets due to other issues I believe they are causing (upset stomach) whilst doctors or pharmacists don't agree that the tablets could do that,there's nothing else I'm taking that could cause an upset stomach that has been chronic since February this year (not long after the dosage was upped. The main point is that I know I don't want to stay on these tablets and I don't want the dosage upped anymore I hate the tablets I'm on,my anxiety has gotten bad again too. I also may have ADHD if that may come into it at all. Sidenote-I appreciate that this group exists. If anyone has any advice on what I can do I would appreciate it. Thank you.

Women seem to take up a majority of my thinking. Whether it’s me mourning about my ex (who was my first gf) or looking at all these “All men are disgusting,worthless,” posts by women. Or the SMV scale and me feeling super inferior to almost everyonei come across. So much so i always walk with my head down. People are always telling me to walk with my chest up. I don’t understand it but i guess it’s something i do subconsciously. I’m working on getting out of the incel/RP mindset but seeing these posts of misandry have become addicting. I also want to confess when i was watching porn i caught myself getting into the cuck fantasy. Seeing snapchat videos on p hub with degrading titles aimed at me. It’s my cope i guess. Overall i don’t want to hate women. I don’t want to offend anyone either. Every time i mention something about women on reddit i get attacked. I want to get a girlfriend and be able to be the one to take her on dates and stuff. I find it so odd that cars have become my lifelong passion, but also my biggest insecurity for years now. That i will never understand. It’s too the point i stopped going to car shows because i feel like i will compare myself since i’m driving nothing. It has become exhausting trying to bend to Dads will to let me drive.	ShiestyTrackhawk	post	22.491097619836896	male	White	0.016161413863301277	na	na	na	1	depression_help

I really hate that every fucking time i try for a relationship, they always end the fucking same. Short and just ghosted. And a lot of people do wonder why I'm single. Ask my ex's. They'll say sum. Maybe if there was a proper communication than maybe there wouldn't any problems. Like why is it that i conversations get shorter and shorter as the days go on. Why am i the only who puts forth effort. Why do your fuckin emotions change after a day but I'm just left hanging? Why is it that you can have all fucking care for who the fuck ever else but me I'm just left on the back burner. Why are on messaging apps but say you don't wanna text me. Why is it that i have to care about you and try for your? Why is it that when someone doesn't bring choas you are turned off, whilst saying you don't want choas. So why it that I'm always just turned away from and never shown that i am worth a fuck besides friend and family. I'm grateful for all that but wow whyyyy won't anyone FUCKING BE WITH ME?!?!?!?!???!?!?!??!!!!!!?!?!!!?!?

"This is just a rant. Never have anyone to talk to anyways so i might as well just share my recent life struggles. I got a new job at a dealership and it’s OK i guess. I get to practice parking and drive different types of cars. I realize it’s not very satisfying. I say that because basically my days go like this. Wake up mom takes me to work, i work, go home. The time i stay is 9-5. I guess i’m being somewhat productive. I always try to tell myself that things could be worse to make me feel better. It really doesn’t I find i hard to see any positives. I’m not driving yet but my Dad has my car which we bought. I go with Dad on mondays to drive to try to convince him I’m able. He says i can’t have the car until he feels i’m ready to drive. Also i have to buy insurance. I have money saved for insurance and i got a quote. I guess i should ask him again. Anyways i guess my social life is just non existent. I admit i stay on Reddit and YT too much but it feels like the only way to cope with reality that’s not making things worse. I used to smoke trees and watch p hub. All to get my mind out of this reality. 
I got these books at the library. SEO and HTML guides…i want to own my own business so i can live my dream of being s digital nomad in Chicago. I live in Memphis now. 20m. I try to get myself to study but when i get home i’m so tired from work the last thing i think about is studying. However i know i won’t get any closer to making a business by just relaxing all the time. My goals seem so distant from me…i’ve made vision boards, wrote them down multiple times. I guess it’s supposed to be like this as a young man. 
My escape right now is my artwork. I like doing it and when i show people they are amazed at it. I’ve made some posts you can use for refrence. I draw cars and a bit of architecture. My plan is to get a CAD certification here in memphis and go to design school so i can life my true real life goal/dream…to design cars. I feel so much that i won’t get there though.

Not feeling great physically means not feeling great mentally unfortunately. I'm back to barely eating, isolating, and sleeping the day away. I need to get on a healthier regimen, but it's painful to even sit down and read a nice book because of my tailbone. I like taking sunny walks, but I begin to really hurt after a while.

My roommate has depression and has complained to me that loud noises bother him and how he cant sleep but he doesn't do anything to change it. He used to watch TV a d fall asleep in the living room but now has resided to be in his room right across from mine 24/7. He stays up all night gaming and the next day lays in his room with his door wide open, in silence, with no white noise. Every little noise I make he reacts to by huffing or puffing in his bed or gets up and acts perturbed I woke him up, so most of the time I feel like i have to sit and wait for him to wake up before I can do anything around the house and it seems like it's some kind of passive aggressive manipulation tactic.   Because he could fall asleep with  white noise, like a fan or something or watch TV like he used to when I moved in but no. He prefers to repeat the same thing everyday and acts more and more upset but never says anything to me.  Ill wake up in the next morning and his door is always wide open so even though he was up all night, he often gets up when I cook breakfast or get ready for work. Then he literally go's back to his room and lays in his bed sometimes until 3 in the afternoon, and i know not sleeping, just laying there in silence, with his door open. I dont know if its intentional for attention or some kind of lack of self awareness. I've confronted him numerous times and he denies it has anything to do with me.  When I have girlfriends over he paces in front of my door when I cook dinner he will seemingly time it to where he just so happens to get yp to cook st the same time or he'll sit in his room in silence and listen to when I do so he knows when he can cook dinner, usually immediately right after I do. For a long period of time he was trying to match his schedule entirely around mine and would ask me what time I planned.to go to bed and cook eat. I explained to him whenever I feel like,  that   my schedule isn't based on him. I don't think he liked that very much at all and put on an act where he sat in his doorway in a chair in silence for an entire week. I don't know what it is with this dude it's like he doesn't view reality correctly and expects unrealistic things to happen. Like loving with a roomaye but expecting them to walk on eggshells because you sleep with your door open all day in silence dude not my problem! I've gotten to the point where I literally think he go's out of his way to act like this. Which is kind of concerning I live with someone who just Kay's in bed all day and vicariously listen to everything I say and do. It's caused me some mental difficulties myself as I've never dealt with paranoia and this person makes me feel very paranoid. Any advice on how to deal with this would be appreciated.  I'm literally to the point where I feel  anger towards this person because I personally think it's either some kind of passive aggressive act of envy or for maybe its for attention or maybe he's autistic I don't know. All I know is I'm tired of walking on egg shells around this person, I recently work from home and can't tolerate even being here. It's like because I'm here, he puts on this display where he lays in bed with his door open straight across from my room so that when I walk out to get something from the kitchen or have guests or anything, there he is silently laying there. I understand depression but what level of depravity does a person have to have to just lay in bed in silence with your door open all day like some poltergeist type shit?

"(Story's really long so there's a small recap at the end if you don't want to read all of it)

I'm a 16yro guy and it's been months that I feel awful. Idk how it started but just did and I couldn't stop crying. It started a few months ago around february and for the whole month I was just crying. I just couldn't stop all the bad thoughts just came all at once and couldn't do anything abou it. It just overwhelmed me.

I started to hate myself, my life, thinking about my future and how I can't see myself in it. I started to hate my body and being jealous of everyone who looks better than me. I've realized that I have nothing special and I am useful to nothing and nobody. I've been secretly gay for a few years (telling only my best friend and my mom) and I'm in my third year of high school.

I fell in love with another guy (who is straight) in my class at the start of the first year. When I started feeling like this I've wanted to stop feeling anything: emotions,senses anything.

I just feel like the people around me would be much better off without me cause I have nothing to give them. It's been on my mind to kill myself but I know I wont do it. I don't have the strenght to do it. When I think about killing myself I usually just think to just stay away from everyone and never coming out from my bed.

I also began to feel extremely lonely. I have very few friends a few at school and one from elementary school (the one who I first came out to). And I find it really hard to make new friends or to just meet new people being myself an introverted. I just felt like that I'd never find anyone to be with, or someone who love me back.

My friends tried to understand me but I just didn't say anything and kept crying and distancing away from everyone. So me crying just became a regular thing until I stopped and just got vey silent. Every time I did anything I couldn't do it right I just can't do anything when I feel like that and I started believing that I'm just a failure and I can't accomplish anything so why even try.

The only two friends that I've manager to talk to is my best friend too (who I managed to talk about my problems and came out and he gave the best don't care answer that anyone could ever give me: ""why would I hate you if you're gay I'd just be losing a friend"") and the guy who I have a crush on. 

I'm not really scared to come out to my friends (cause I think they figured out thats the reason that I'm depressed) but I don't want to just tell my feelings to him cause then I know it would just be awkard cuz I know he'll reject me cuz i know he's straight. 

I also can't say anything to my family. I had to tell my mom cause the school called home and I to tell her something. She is not supportive at all she thinks that I'd be happier with a woman but at least she doesn't put any pressare on mw and she doesn't hate or anything. My brother instead is straight up racist and homophobic so he's definatly out of the way. And my father I just don't care enough of his opinion to tell him so he'll just find out if I'll find someone who likes me.

At the end I'm just looking for help and advice on how to change back cause I hate feeling like this.

Ps: tysm in advance for reading everything. Sorry if my english is not the best, im not english and I'm writing on the phone.

Since the text came out really long I'll just do a small recap with the most important stuff:

I feel like crap and I want to kill myself (but I'll never do it). I have frequent emotional swings where I feel like I'm worhless, that I'm not special, I feel extremly lonely and I don't know how to make any new friends, I hate my body and I'm jealous of everyone else and I've been secretly gay (only now I've started to come out to my friends) and have a crush on my straight friend.

At the end of he story I'm asking for advice on how to better my situation cause I don't want to feel like this anymore (not expecially to come out or to just meet new friends I'm asking advice to just help me out of depression.

That’s disappointing when you’re experiencing something like you’ve described, I hope you felt acknowledged in what you’re experiencing. Try instead of waiting to feel upset to plan some activities that you can find enjoyment in, start with something small and easy.

"A therapist should never make you feel like your pain is invalid or just try to band-aid the problem. That sounds more like what a high school or college counsellor would do.

"I’m barely getting myself and all my shit together after going to therapy for a couple of months. So I decided to go out yesterday and I met a woman who I had a one-night-stand with. Unfortunately the condom broke, but I noticed it right away, so I quickly pulled out and replaced it with a new one.

I couldn’t get sleep because I kept thinking about stds and why it had to happen the first time I got with someone after almost completely beating my depression.

So I looked up symptoms and sure enough I began having mild sweats, my body temperature rose a little, a mild headache and sinuses. Which apparently are symptoms of hiv. But I know symptoms would not begin to show just hours after exposure to an std.

So right now I think I’m about to break down in tears. Not sure how long I have to wait until I can go get tested or if my mind is playing tricks on me with the “symptoms” I had last night. I don’t feel like eating or exercising or doing anything really.

Any advice please? And thank you for reading this and any feedback."	mycomikael	post	28.364174026094496	female	White	0.9980098605155945	na	na	na	17	depression_help

Those symptoms are probably just anxiety. Don't overthink it and don't let panic get you (I know it's hard but it's the best way to go about it).

There is a pill you can take that is 99% effective in prevent HIV post exposure if you think you were exposed to HIV . It has to be started within 72 hours of exposure , the sooner the better. It is called Pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PEP for short.  You may be able to get it at your local health dept, ER, or urgent care. Also online prescriptions can be sent to your pharmacy from apps like Plush Care, Call on Doc, or  Hey Mister. You can Google “where can I get PEP” for more info.	mycomikael	reply	na	na	na	0.9980098605155945	no	no	no	na	depression_help

It won’t harm you if you don’t have HIV. PEP can cause mild side effects, including nausea, upset stomach, fatigue and headaches. These symptoms often get better or go away after the first week of taking PEP. To prevent nausea, take PEP with a snack or before bed to make nausea less noticeable. You take it for 28 days. This one is for emergencies only, like condom breaking.  Another drug called PREP can be taken regularly as a preventive HIV medication.

Hello! I researched PEP just like JDN mentioned, and I left work early in order to get to the doctor’s office before they closed. He prescribed me a 28 day supply of pills to take. As well as lab work. So I should get the results by next week. He did mention though that three months later I must go back in order to get some more lab work done. So yeah. I’ll keep you guys updated. Thanks for the info though! If my doctor hadn’t pulled through, I probably would have gone to planned parenthood. . .

"I am a 18y dude. My life is a complete mess, and i need some help to put it back together and get on track.
I'll resume my life in the past 3 years:
I was on the last 3 years of secondwry school. I am about to go to the university. I am not sire if i will enter as my qverage grade sucks. It sucks bc i didn't care about  the most important part of school. All i wanted was to go home and play video games. I have doubts if my friends actuslly enjoy talking to me and being with me. I am a pretty anti-social person, and not very enjoyable to talk to. I can hold a conversation but it's really hard for me to start one. I have an addiction to video-games and probably to pornography too. All my friends are getting their lifes on track, getting girlfriedns, a good job, getting into their universities, etc. But i am a complete mess. Everytime i think of having a relationship, the first thing that comes to mind is the future, sex, cuddling etc. It's hard to look at a woman and not think of her in that sense. I can't put my life on track, no matter how hard i try.
What could i possibly do?
Any help is welcome.

You absolutely can put your life on track. You are very young, you know that you are wasting too much time with video games and pornography. You know the problem, which is the first step to fixing it. You have convinced yourself With negative patterns of thinking that you can’t change. You can change your current pattern of thinking. There are several things that you can try. If you are able, a qualified therapist can help a lot. If therapy is not an option, there are things that you can do on your own. Google “CBT therapy” and “DBT therapy” and you’ll find information and exercises that many therapist use to help clients to develop more productive patterns of thinking. Guided meditation is also an excellent tool to move your thoughts in a more productive direction. Guided meditation acts on neurotransmitters in your brain and allows you to form new patterns of thought. There are excellent guided meditations on YouTube for addiction, social anxiety, fear of the future, and much more. Just search guided meditation and you’ll find hundreds videos to help you. Guided meditation must be used everyday ( two times a day is best in beginning). Don’t give up on it. Guided meditation will require several weeks of daily practice before you feel the benefits. You have a thinking problem. The thoughts that you are creating are holding you back. You can change this pattern of thinking to become productive, social, and at peace with yourself. You have many thoughts, insights, skills, talents, and charisms that can be shared with others. You are young and you can change features of yourself that you don’t like. You just need the right tools to move your thoughts in the right direction. Try all of the things that I’ve listed above, and see what works best for you. Also, everyday list three things that you like about yourself and three things that you are grateful for  (you can find them if you look), and repeat those things to yourself throughout the day. You are young and you have an extraordinary life in front of you. I pray that you have a life filled with new blessings, love, peace, and purpose. You can change if you want to.

"Hi everyone.

I feel like I’m dying, and I’m thinking of killing myself. 

I try to be a good person, and I’ve done well. I’ve been sober for four years, I’ve helped others - I’m an addict, I have borderline personality disorder, I have ADHD-C. The last few years have been too much. I was in a unhealthy relationship, I lost my job unfairly, I think I may have ptsd because I was in a relationship with someone with the same afflictions as me - but untreated. I found her in a hospital cracking her head open against a wall one night, until it split open. Like that film bird box, only someone you love. A few days ago I cut her out, I don’t even have photographs left of her. Now In writing this, I feel panicked. There was no room for me or my needs in that relationship. I think I learnt how to desensitise because recently I am so numb, life is too overwhelming to even shower daily. I have no motivation despite high doses of medication. I don’t think I’m thinking about the past, I can’t stand the present moment.

I don’t know what to do. I’m thinking about relapsing with cannabis, in order to change something. 

As pathetic as it sounds, I don’t believe I can find enjoyment in anything and I’m flat out of ideas. I’ve rung out everything I could think of. 

I’m too anxious about trying something new. I really need help, because I feel like I’m going to wake up and kill myself one day. This is too persistent and my behaviour is becoming more and more erratic. 

I love you all."	Quiet_Possession6713	post	27.70125454564286	female	White	0.9984347224235535	na	na	na	4	depression_help

I am also an addict with mental health issues. I’ve been sober for a while, and have been able to find purpose and meaning in life. If you haven’t attended AA or NA meetings, you may want to start. I personally prefer AA. You can look at [aa.org](https://aa.org) to find meetings in your area, there are also meetings on Zoom. The step work in AA, as well as the group support and fellowship can help a lot. Therapy, and prescription medications can also be helpful. It can take some time to find the right combination of therapy and medication, so if something isn’t working for you seek a new therapist or new meds. I also started using guided meditation in recovery, and it changed my life for the better. There are excellent guided meditations on YouTube for many of the mental health struggles that you list. If you stick with it and practice guided meditation every day ( it requires daily practice) you will start to see your thoughts shift in a more positive direction in a few weeks. You can get better if you persist in finding the right help to treat your negative patterns of thought. Through guided meditation, and AA I found a spiritual part of myself that I was sure did not exist. You are a strong person, you’ve endured a lot in your life. You have much experience to bring to a world that desperately needs you at your best. You have so much to offer. Don’t lose hope. If you are persistent in trying things that can help, you will find a way out of these destructive patterns of thinking. I pray you have a life filled with new blessings, love, peace, and great purpose.	Quiet_Possession6713	reply	na	na	na	0.9984347224235535	no	strong	no	na	depression_help
"While there sounds like there’s a couple different things you could look into to heal. The biggest thing that seems to stick out is the grieving you’re going through with your past relationship. Having to desensitize yourself is the reaction you had to not feeling safe. So it’s only natural to feel the way you have. Please know this will pass. Maybe spending some time in silence or writing about it would help as an outlet for what you’re going through. 

Acknowledge that you went though something painful. It does hurt now. That’s ok. Allow yourself to feel and grieve as you feel is needed. Do everything in your power to do the good things for yourself. It will help speed up the healing process and how you operate after the healing process. 

Above all, when you feel numb, panicked or whatever else. Stop. Breathe. Remind yourself that you’ll be ok.

Every year around my birthday, awful things happen. It’s been this way for as long as I can remember and it’s only getting worse as I get older. I’ll be spending this birthday in the hospital due to double pneumonia and pleurisy. I’m starting to get depressed again because I feel like these things happen around or on my birthday and it makes me feel like either a burden or simply like I don’t deserve good things. I mask a lot because I’m autistic and ADHD so many times people don’t know my depression among other things is there. On top of all of these events, my dad got diagnosed with cancer. I’m blaming myself because it’s happening around my birthday. How do I deal with these feelings?	GooglyEyed_Gal	post	14.375880288382966	male	White	0.9965007305145264	na	na	na	1	depression_help

All are options for you to look into to heal.

For those of you who discontinued meds due to numbing or “blunting” of emotions, how bad was it??? Some people claim it just makes emotions less intense or sort of dulls them down but for me it feels like complete loss of emotions/emotional reaction to things. And how long did it take you to recover the ability to feel both positive and negative emotions and or react to things after discontinuing meds???

Hey, I can't really offer advice but just wanted to say that you are definitely not alone. I've been struggling to get out of the house. I basically only go out to get groceries and even then I get some dry and frozen food so I'm able to stretch out past a week or two without getting groceries. It's also quite hot too. It's weird cuz summer is usually my favorite season but now I just don't feel the desire to go to the beach or do much . It's hard to contact friends too since I don't have consistent energy. I spend most of my time watching kdramas and then doing chores when I can. I feel like if you bore yourself to death eventually you'll push yourself out for a bit. Maybe start with walking to the mailbox.. or park.. or going out in evenings when it's not as hot. Hope you feel better.

"Same. I have literally nobody. Living with my parents rn unfortunately had an intruder at my old apt so came back ' WITH my 13 year old son. I take him to school and I go to either the gas station down the road, or the grocery store. That is pretty much it. And the doctors office. As far as the heat goes yes. I live in the south. It's horrible. I have reverse seasonal depression, I swear that must be a thing. It's especially not fun getting out in it if you're not really doing anything. Walking around a neighborhood or park just for the sake of being outside? When it's over 100F? Im really sensitivr to it also. 90f and up if im in it for more than 10 or 15 mins im at risk for barfing or fainting so....No thanks.
There's nobody worthwhile to meet to make friends where I'm at, either, and especially in their 30s or at least around it.

Needless to say I totally understand. I've dealt with this probably since 2018 I've been almost completely isolated and its absolutely maddening. You can only clean your house, watch youtube and do whatever else so many times. You can also only try to meet people and get out with it being a waste of time -- so many times.

I break things into very small achievable action steps. Start by just walking over to the computer and moving it to where you will watch it later.  Just do that, congratulate yourself and accept that it is a step in the right direction. When you want to accomplish another goal, turn the computer on and search videos for motivation. You don’t have to watch them right  then, just select something to watch. You will have accomplished another goal. When you are ready, watch. I personally like guided meditations for motivation on YouTube. The videos relax the mind, are easy to spend time with, and create a state of mind that is ready to act. The overall point is don’t look at the entire project, just look at the small steps that make up the project. Looking at the entire goal can be overwhelming. Breaking it into little pieces makes it manageable. Move one small step at a time until the journey is completed. You can do this. You are stronger than you feel right now. Guided meditation is a powerful tool to help you maintain energy. You can do this. You can live your very best life.	Previous-Snow6381	reply	na	na	na	0.9990335702896118	no	no	no	na	depression_help

I was supposed to go abroad with my sibling to a concert and we got the tickets like years ago as a gift but the event got postponed several times. now we are finally supposed to go this weekend and we have booked everything etc. but I have severe self-hatred, social anxiety and depression, and I guess I'm in an episode because now I just feel so much pain inside and I don't want to go. I actually see no point in doing anything at all when I am always uncomfortable, sad and internally alone- never just at peace. what’s the point of travelling to hate myself in another country or go to public events to hate myself there and be uncomfortable and not even be able to enjoy it. I see no point being outside and going to events when you’re just a drain for others I don’t want to bring anybody down or chain them down or make them feel obligated to attempt to make me enjoy it or something. but obviously this means I'm bailing on them and that obviously sucks and a lot of money would be wasted. I wish I could just will myself to go but it feels like being told to put out a raging forest fire with words. I feel like I have to go but if I did I would just be a hollow shell of myself.  everybody is rightfully mad at me as I am at myself. any advice for me would be helpful.

Doesn't sound like a depression post but it is. I met this girl towards the end of my studies and we both developed a crush on each other, however since she is moving she ruled out that anything more can happen between us. Since then though, we've been texting almost everyday and I can feel myself being incredibly emotionally dependent on her messaging me back. For example she suggested two days ago that we have a phone call yesterday which was really elating. So I asked her what time would work and since then she hasn't answered (she has seen my stories on Instagram however). I fucking hate this, why am I feeling so miserable when she was the one to even suggest the call and everything? This is such a big pattern in my life, it's like I hyper fixate on certain people and need their approval so so bad, and if they don't give me the approval 24/7 I feel awful and wanna kill myself.. does anyone have any advice to stop this?	mmmhtroe	post	12.69160525353601	female	White	0.9991932511329651	na	na	na	2	depression_help

Yeah this is really common, unfortunately. I hate the “are you taking your meds?”. One thing I have realized over time is that this is my family asking if I’m ok with the limited vocabulary that they have. It’s NOT a magic pill, I have found therapy to be the most help long term. Just remember that they do love you, and they are asking if you are ok in their own way. A good solution may be to have a conversation when you are feeling even keeled and let them know what kind of language you prefer. For me, I would rather hear “hey it seems like you are having a rough patch. I love you and I’m here if you need a hug or someone to listen to you”. Good luck. Keep strong, life can get better.

Yes me too, at least we are better off now than we were that we can function better.

"I run a business, and since three months ago, I have been diagnosed with moderately severe situational depression stemming from chronic burnout over a few years, marked by hopelessness, helplessness and emptiness, dissociation, psychosomatism (palpitations, tremors, hyperventilations), and suicidal thoughts. Also, I've been clinically diagnosed with trauma, which manifests in immense anxiety on anything/anyone related to work, which means I still can't open/reply email, or have any discussion on work at all. Fast forward three months, I've been ruminating whether I made the right sequences of choices:

1. For a month after the onset of my depression, I was still working, albeit less productive (approx 75% of my regular productivity). I shared about my condition to my business partner, and asked him to cover on some key business tasks.
2. After the first month, because my condition was deteriorating, I decided to take a month off, and my business partner would continue to lead the company.
3. After my one month of leave, I haven't felt better (and in fact, some symptoms continue to deteriorate, and my score on depression scale went up again). Hence, I decided to extend my leave by one additional month. As per the first month of leave, I didn't worry about taking the break because I trusted my business partner to lead and handle everything. During the two months off, I went completely offline, mostly about the worsening anxiety and trauma, and its manifestation in passive suicidal thoughts and physical symptoms.

In the last couple of months I was away, some things at work had not gone as per planned due to my absence, and as a result, the company had to let some employees go, and there is a chance we might have to shut down. I thought my business partner would be able to keep things afloat and move things forward, but unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case in the last two months.  
In the last few days, I've been feeling guilt for taking the time off, but at the time it was something I desperately needed, because I was struggling so bad. What would you have done if you were me?"	throwaway-78285	post	29.332999705363925	female	White	0.9950430393218994	na	na	na	2	depression_help

There is nothing to be guilty about. If you had a different disease like pneumonia, you would not feel guilty about taking time to recover. It sounds like your business partner may be more dependent on you than you had realized. The need for your presence speaks to your competence, which is a good thing. I have suffered from PTSD, anxiety, and depression. It took some time to find the right therapist and medications to restore me to 100%. I changed therapists several times, and tried several different classes of medication. Something that was recommended and helped enormously is guided meditation. Honestly when it was recommended I thought it was rubbish. I never stuck with it for more than a couple days. But, once I committed to practicing twice a day every single day, things started to get better. It took a few weeks of consistent practice, but I was able to get off of medication. There are excellent guided meditations for depression, anxiety, and more on YouTube. There is science behind guided meditation. It acts on neurotransmitters in the brain, and forms new pathways of thought and emotion. You may want to give it a try. Just stay with it for at least two weeks. The larger point is be persistent in finding a therapeutic approach that works for you long-term. Breaks can be necessary, but finding the right treatment is critical. I wish you a life of peace, prosperity, and purpose.	throwaway-78285	reply	na	na	na	0.9950430393218994	weak	no	no	na	depression_help

Some cases you can be made to go against your will. If you feel you need to thats a diffrent story though.

"I've had ongoing depression for a while now and haven't been able to leave my apartment. I haven't taken out garbages, done laundry, cleaned my room, bathroom... Nothing. Most of all, I am afraid of my refrigerator. I haven't opened it in a long time, but it smells bad. I know I have old food, drinks, containers in it that have been sitting in there for at least 2 months... 

I'm starting to feel better this week, but the mountainous amount of cleaning and the disgusting state of my apartment is holding me back. I have a little more motivation and want to do a little more and feel better, but when I look at the huge amount of cleaning I would need to do... I just lay back in bed because it's too much and I don't know how I can do it all.

I'm too ashamed of the state of my apartment to have seen any friends or family in months, and I just cannot ask anyone else for help. I also can't afford any professional help.

Does anyone have any advice on how to go about cleaning this disaster in a methodical/approachable way? I think I will feel better living in a clean apartment, but getting to that point just feels impossible, and I hate that I did this all to myself."	determinedaddax	post	25.508578267770716	female	White	0.9993341565132141	na	na	na	10	depression_help

"10 min a day minimum: seriously.

It doesn't matter if you literally do just 10 min a day, since you know you will be cleaning it every day you will start to organize it as you go.

"Acknowledging that your cleaning is a step of your healing process. You mentioned the start of feeling better, yet the amount of cleaning is hold you back. That generally points to the direction that accomplishing the cleaning will help you even more. 

You might start small. Maybe clean one room today. Put on some of your favorite music and just get after it. You’ll most likely find that the idea of the cleaning has built up to look scarier than it actually is once you start doing it. So start with something you know you can accomplish. Then work your way through the apartment. 

You could also make a list of each room or task that you need to do and again work to get one of them done each day till its all done. 

As for future cleaning, my new habit is not being able to go to bed until my room and office are organized. Otherwise when depression hits the mess only snowballs sort of like what you may be dealing with. 

You got this! Take it one thing at a time and you’ll notice the difference in yourself and your apartment.

"Acknowledging and seeking help is a great first step!

Start slow and don’t overwhelm yourself by trying too many things at once, just do one at a time and build it up over the days, consistency is always better than running yourself into the ground on day 1 because then you’ll just be right back where you started. 

I know sometimes making lists or organising a plan of action can seem either daunting or draining and sometimes it’s a lot easier if someone just tells you what to do instead, so I’ll suggest what I used to do when I was at my lowest points. (But know this might not be the right approach/might not work for you). 

First, I would throw out the easily collectible and immediately *visible* trash. Just focus on that one task. I find it’s a great way to start to clear some space, maybe get rid of some harmful things, and completing a task helps me feel better. 

Then, either if you’ve still got energy or on another day entirely, slowly start on one area. I would recommend your bedroom first (it’s always nice to have a good environment for sleeping) but it can be wherever you choose. You can tackle it (by taking it one individual task/bullet point at a time, one zone at a time) in an order similar to: 

1. clear floor space: 
* pick up trash and keep a fresh trash bag available as you go to easily throw more in; 
* separate items (clothing, electronics, books, etc.) - it doesn’t have to be a rigorous organisation, just simply collect similar things into a similar area so you know what things are and can sort them at a later time; 
* remove dirty things to appropriate places (laundry into a laundry basket, plates to the kitchen - you don’t have to do them right now, just move them), 

2. repeat the same process of the floor for clearing surfaces like tables, then other furniture, 

3. wipe down and/or clean where necessary, you can work in/treat this as separate zones as well if you need to. 

4. Organise what remains (this step isn’t essential if you feel the actual *cleaning* part of the apartment in general is more important, organisation can wait until later). 

Eventually, working zone by zone, you’ll get either a cleaner or, at least, more *manageable* room by the end. It’s perfectly okay for this process to take place over many days or weeks - just try to do a bit more each day. 

Then, once one room is done, you’ll be able to move onto the next area in the same manner. It’s better to start with easier or simpler tasks first that won’t overwhelm you, so adjust as necessary to what fits your goals and abilities best. 

Once the bulk of the rooms are either clean or at least more manageable, you can do the more detailed or daunting tasks like laundry, cleaning the dishes, the fridge etc.

When it comes to things like laundry or dishes, again just do a little at a time. Say you wash 3 dishes a day, then eventually you’ll work through all of them. If you can do more that’s great but if not, then it’s fine just to keep the goals small."	determinedaddax	reply	na	na	na	0.9993341565132141	weak	no	no	na	depression_help

"Get a box of big 40 gallon trash bags. Hold your breath and put everything in the fridge, in the trash bag and tie it off tight and put it in dumpster.

Get some spray-on cleaner, spray the insides of the fridge and wipe with paper towel.

Empty everything from the sink. Get a large pan or fill one side of the sink with hot water and liquid soap.

Wash dishes with a scrubby sponge and hot soapy water, rinse the soap off with tap water from faucet, put item down to dry on counter covered with clean towel.

You can take glass shelves out of the fridge and also wash them in soapy water and rinse then dry.

If the fridge still smells inside after emptying and cleaning, put an open box of baking soda in the fridge.

Well with the fridge you could do a shelf a day nothing extreme just a shelf a day simple. I myself understand that it’s really difficult to do things that other might say is simple. Like when I was in a 3 year depressive slump I struggled to wash my hair, brush my teeth, even change clothes. It can be a really hard thing to get through. There was an app they made you can get ppl to come help you with all sorts of things around the house. It might be embarrassing but keep in mind that they’ve probably seen a lot worse. If you’re wanting to do it yourself and are worried about the smell you could buy some gloves and a mask to block out the smell.	determinedaddax	reply	na	na	na	0.9993341565132141	no	strong	no	na	depression_help

How do I stop being ashamed of - or atleadt move past a bad thing I did years ago? So, years ago I really hurt someone by making a (not intentionally) racist caricature as an attempt at levity. I hinestly can't say why I did it, because I don't know, i was stupid. Anyways i profusely apologized after I swallowed my pride and they forgave me a couple days later. It has been years since and i have no contact with the person but almost daily I still think about it and feel utterly crushed that I could ever have imagined doing something so stupid and hurtfulbto another. It is a serious contribution to my larger mental health problems and I want to move past it, atleast somewhat. How do I do this? Have you experienced anything similar?

The fact that you still feel guilty about this shows immense growth. Sometimes good people do bad things. While you can't undo it you can learn from it and it seems you have. Maybe a good way to balance out the bad would be to do some good. Donate to a charity or do something nice for someone you know. Put out something positive into the universe to balance the negative.

"I'm almost 19 years old, graduated high school, but I still feel like I haven't accomplished anything for myself in my time alive. I'm just at a point in my life where day by day, I realize that I'm not living for myself. Other people do more with my own time then i do. If it werent for my family and close friends, I wouldnt have a reason to wake up every day, or even be here anymore. 
I live in a small town in the US where most people have to slave there lives away just to afford basic living. Only to have some random rich people take from what you earn for yourself. I have to find a basic stupid job that nobody wants to do, for a basic wage that nobody wants to earn, just to have a chance of one day being able to afford a house and start a family. The thing is, I don't want that, I just wanna have land of my own with friends. I wanna feel like I'm truly free to build and create to my hearts content. 
I don't have a bad life. I have good friends and a family that loves me, but I have my fair share of bad luck and problems. I struggle to feed myself most days, and my ADHD makes for plenty of restless nights. I wake up every morning feeling sick to my stomach. I'm in constant pain every single day because of my back and neck (Scheurmanns Kyphosis)(and a Torticolis) so I've never really been able to use my body to its full potential. I'm very emotionally distant and often show a blank gaze. The smallest thing could go wrong and then before you know it, the BPD kicks in. One second I'll be happy, then pissed, then depressed. For some reason my brain gets upset that I'm getting angry and it keeps spiraling out of control. I have the worst anxiety out of anyone I've ever met, and have panic attacks or tremble over nothing. 
Most night just wonder what it would be like if I didn't wake up. I wish I could just sink into the dirt and become one with the universe again."	TechnosDragon	post	23.25402227513114	male	White	0.992324709892273	na	na	na	2	depression_help

"You're young, put less pressure on yourself. You have a good head on your shoulders. Well put together beliefs and description of what you are feeling. 

That sick to your stomach feeling is your fight or flight response kickin in out of place. Whether or not you recongnize it you have learned over the years to make it manageable during the day. You can't do it in your sleep. Still bites me in the ass some mornings too. 

Something I did was get a cheap heart rate monitor. Everytime my anxiety kicked in it my heart rate was over 100. I stumbled upon the diving effect. Basically holding your breath and submerging your head in water will lower your heart rate. It can help you get your bearings back. Doesn't help everyone, but its simple enough to give a shot.

Life's tough right now. Take it one step at a time. I think you are clever enough to get the most of whatever job you end up getting. When you are feeling down about anything and are talking to someone about try to be optimistic. This is meant to convince them, you don't have to believe it.

"However, my dad has recently stopped speaking to me (again) after telling his partner (after she asked and told me in confidence that it was a “safe space”) about his behaviour throughout my whole life. (Name calling, poking fun at weight, belittling any issue I had to make way for his own) 

Well he has decided to stop speaking to me and after numerous attempts at contacting him he has decided that he doesn’t want to. This isn’t the first time this has happened. The first time being him making fun of his partners weight while doing the Xmas tree and infront of their young children. I was (admittedly) a bit drunk and triggered and left in a tissy. So fair enough, he could blame me. However we didn’t speak for over a year. I had to come to him. And he never mentioned it again or apologised for his behaviour. 

So this was all swept under the carpet. And then this evening happened. He wasn’t there for me telling his partner this info but she has blown it up and now he won’t even reply to a text. 

I am heartbroken. I never feel good enough for anyone. I am currently having issues within my (last bar) job and friend life, which is now causing major issues within me and my partners life. 

I am seriously at my wits end at the moment. Could anyone direct me towards some ways to let go of this feeling? I need to be able to move on before I start this amazing job in a couple of months.

Meanwhile, you've learned you can't trust your dad's partner, and it shouldn't be surprising that her ""loyalty"" is to her partner. Unfortunately, probably all of us have at least one experience with trusting someone who turns out to be untrustworthy. It sucks.

Your dad is being an immature jerk. Unless you are tied to him by something you need from him (beyond wanting to have a relationship with him), I don't know why you'd subject yourself to his behavior anymore. You don't owe him the aggravation he wants to stir up by his being a petulant child. 

It reads like you're having difficulties in various relationships and letting it affect your self-esteem. I can totally relate. It's hard for me to ""keep my head up"" when I feel hammered. I wish I had the magic cure for that. I need support from other people to help me feel better. If you haven't explored professional help, I think that would be a positive start.

After having depression for so long. I felt so numb. My relatives that i was super close to died. I felt nothing. My father hugged me crying while i stood there blankly. All i feel is hate towards myself for not being able to express emotions anymore. Recently i started doing self harm. Like i was in control, i knew what i was doing but i still did it. I felt so much in pain and not being able to express it made it so much more painful. I finally cried. I FINALLY CRIED but at what cost. Im afraid of thinking this is my only resort towards expressing my emotions so can someone help me. Give me some substitutes. Your free to give me praises and encouragement and stuff like that but my mind usually just block those out.

Im a trans male and in high school. Ive been working on doing better with mental health, finding medications and what not and joining communities like me. While Im doing a lot better than I have before, Im constantly getting stuck in my head. I write sometimes, I find that a lot better than complaining to a random person whos ready to send me into a hospital. I just recently started marching band, which has gotten me so much more energized. But thats the problem, I have so much energy and nothing to do with it. 8 hours of practice in 100 degree F heat 7 days a week and Im still not tired. I usually do some other activity (biking, roller skating) for several hours immediately after that and come home with blisters on my feet. Ive found that difficult exercise is the only effective thing that distracts me from my thoughts and I think Im overworking myself. My brain doesnt realize it till I go to bed and Im throbbing. I worry Im going to hurt myself and I dont know how much exercise is too much. Does anyone have any suggestions of something else I could try alongside this?

"Okay so here goes.
I apologise for it being a long story!

My girlfriend of two years is suffering with depression and had been for around 3 years before we got together. Her ex was a drug user, had been abusive at least once with her and so her depression worsened terribly. We got together and everything  was great. She was loving and caring, couldn't live without me. 

We went on a cruise in 2022 and she struggled massively with her depression even though she had family with her. She was acting up, acting childish. We came home and I told her that we couldn't go on like we were and she needed to see the doctor for anti depressants. She obliged and they started her off on the meds. She changed for the better, having more confidence in herself etc. 

Things were still great until around November/December 2022 when we began discussing what was to happen is she was pregnant. A disagreement ensured about what would happen, things got out of hand and I mistakenly explained that I would leave her if that was to happen. Gruel, I know...people make mistakes. Xmas comes and she reveals she has booked us a holiday to spain, which was booked in october time. Anyways, february/march 1023 comes. Me, her and my friend go out for drinks in town (she has anxiety about being out in our local town) and we get discussing the same issue. My friend sides with me and she can't handle the pressure, walks out and goes home crying. Now me putting this down to her just being bratty/me not caving in I stay out. The next day she says she was upset but that not to worry and we move on. 

Ever since that day things seem to go down hill. The effort she once put in just wasnt the same. She stopped wanting to come round my house as much, our conversation seemed to be more of a struggle. We'd be in bed and she'd be facing the other way. If we had a film on she'd be on her phone instead (I think her escape at the time). She now seemed to just want to drive around in her car (our town has limited activities and both of us being into cars that now also seemed like her release). At this point just before we're due to go away and she suggests that her meds are no longer working. She goes to the doctors and doesn't mention that she's away and they put her on a different medication.

June 2023-now she is the type of person who stresses herself since everything has to be perfect. So we go away and within the first few days she starts to snap at me. Being at a theme park we'd be waiting in the line for a ride, if i touched her you'd think I wasnt even there. She'd be on her phone messaging a lad who she insisted was just her friend who also drives around town. Bearing in mind she is a very friendly lass who enjoys speaking to people and making friends with a range of people, I think no more of this. The trust between both of us has always been at 110%. A few other things happen while we're there including me losing my temper at her, and I tell her the truth about how I feel once we get home. 

Present- it's at this point after the holiday that things really get bad. Our conversation pretty much dies. We only speak and see each other about trying to work things out, what's wrong and what not. We get to the point where she says she can't make herself happy, nevermind make me happy and that she can't commit to a relationship anymore. She paid a visit to the doctor who has put her back on her old medication however any attempt to try and help her and she just repeats that she needs time to herself and that she is trying to be independent (she has been wrapped in cotton wool by her family). Now I'll admit it's been hard to leave her to herself, I've pushed abit too much to help her when she's told me to give her time and now we've argued. We've made peace with what we've argued about and I have told her that I will definitely give her the space she needs to get herself better. She has a block on talking to anyone about any of her feelings, especially me. 

If there's anyone who has been in the same situation as me or who is knowledgeable about depression and partners with depression that can provide some advice that would be great. I realise that this is a very specific situation with the driving around in her car, the baby disagreement was a big issue which we have discussed. She says she wants a future with me but she needs to get herself sorted before she commits herself to me again. The biggest worry that is she has done a complete U-turn on how she felt and acts towards me. She seems to not want to put any effort in to fix things but I do realise it's not as easy as that for her.

Many thanks"	Widda97	post	29.374286131809757	female	White	0.9980759620666504	na	na	na	3	depression_help

Living with a depressed person is extremely difficult. My wife had to start seeing her own therapist to manage living with my depression. When someone is having an extreme episode of depression, they have no strength at all, no emotional bandwidth. I also found that while medication can help, over a period of time  certain meds. can cause you to become emotionally flat. You don’t feel depressed, you don’t feel happy or sad, you just exist. Self isolation is also very common in depression. With persistence, I was able to manage my depression. I had to try many different therapists, various medications, and different therapeutic  techniques to manage my depression. It was a long road with much work. Depression can result from chemical imbalances that push thoughts in a self destructive direction. Know that she can get better, and come to effectively control her depression. Also know that you can’t make her better. You can try to let her know that you’re there for her when she’s ready. You can encourage her to try new approaches to treating her depression (a new therapist, alternative medications, new techniques like guided meditation - there are extremely effective guided meditations specifically for depression on YouTube). You can support her in seeking treatment. But, you’re not equipped to treat her depression. Only she can make herself better, and that requires working to get at the root causes and proper treatment Of her depression. You care for her, and it’s painful for you to see her suffer. Try to avoid letting yourself fall too deeply into her problem. Make time to do the things that bring you joy. Remember that you deserve to live your best life. What’s happening to you is not fair, and the injustice of it all is frustrating. You want the best parts of your relationship back. If she works to improve her mental health that can happen. So many people do overcome depression, and she can too. At this point all that you can do is to take good care of your own mental health, and encourage her to keep fighting until she finds the right treatment or combinations of treatments. I’m praying for you both.	Widda97	reply	na	na	na	0.9980759620666504	no	strong	no	na	depression_help
Thanks very much for the advice. Hoping that leaving her completely to herself that she gets herself better without her going for good. However, I know that it would be for the best if that's the way it's going to go rather than putting ourselves through anymore heartache etc. She's back on her old meds like I say, that's a start, if we can help her to see a counsellor again then we'll do that as soon as we can but she's dead set against any help at the minute.

Sigh. Why life sucks? I feel everything I do doesn't matter anymore. No one understands me and even my so closest friends don't even bother reaching out to me. Nothing good happens in my home, workplace and relationship. I hope someone finds me and give a me hug. I think a hug can somehow ease my pain. Crying alone does not feel good.

I’m so sorry that you are in pain. I wish that I was there to give you a hug. You deserve to live your very best life. Remember that you are a unique creation. You have thoughts, emotions, insights, interests, talents, skills, and charisms that are meant to be shared. You are depressed right now, but you can get better. You have the strength to fight past these negative feelings. It’s hard for friends to watch us struggle, so they  often pull away from us when we most need them. Try to reach deep into yourself and find the things that you believe in the most. Find the things that you want to grow and to develop in this world. There you will find your purpose in life. When you have a purpose, you can withstand any hardships on the path to achieving your goal. Look outside of yourself, and see where you can do some good today. Work toward the good. Guided meditation can help you fight depression, and help you to find greater purpose. There are excellent guided meditations that you can practice everyday to direct your thoughts toward the positive. Guided meditation is a powerful tool to redirect your thoughts and actions. This world has so many problems, we need you at your best to make things better. I’m praying for you.	PatientChest9774	reply	na	na	na	0.9992645382881165	strong	no	no	na	depression_help

Is it healthy to admit that your not fine but your not willing to get help or is it better to just continue with the illusion and tell myself things such as “im fine, i dont need help, i can shoulder this on my own”. Its not that i dont want therapy, im afraid of the cost, im afraid it would leak to the public, im afraid that when i voice out my negativity it would affect others to think the same way. And even if you say your relatives can cover the cost. NO, i would kill myself if they found out im struggling like this. I want to continue to show them a smiling son even if it hurts me, even if im slowly dying inside. They have given me so much already. I dont want to make them think its their fault.

"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings with such openness and honesty. 

It sounds like having a challenging time between admitting that you're not fine and the fear of seeking help. It's completely okay to feel torn about this; emotions can be complex and conflicting, especially when it comes to our well-being.

If cost is a concern, there are options available, such as community mental health centers, sliding-scale fees, or online resources that offer affordable or even free counseling. Privacy is a valid concern, but therapists are bound by strict confidentiality rules to ensure your privacy and protect your information.

Also, seeking help doesn't mean you're burdening your family or that they would think it's their fault and you won't necessarily make them think the same as you. Your loved ones care about you deeply and would want you to prioritize your well-being. 

I hope that some of this help."	Secure_Stomach_7310	reply	na	na	na	0.997850775718689	strong	no	no	na	depression_help

"I don’t want to alarm or reach out really. I just want to know this isn’t it. I feel life has peaked and gone. I know now the person most dearest to me in the world was the best and worst thing to ever happen to me. Like a pendulum. I don’t want the toxic poison in my life anymore. After pouring my heart out and putting my feelings and soul on the line they carried on with disloyal behaviour three days later indiscriminately with a big smile on their face behind my back. Second life. A huge f u to the way I feel and everything we had for 20 years. Begging me for the chance and opportunity to prove herself and then goes and proves everything I needed to know. All my heart, vocalisation and tears away from her at work meant nothing. With her since we was 14 and 34 now. We had a year apart in the middle tho so not quite 20 years. It’s been my whole life and I can’t go back to the way I was before her… I was 14 and a bit of a twat lol. 

I had to do the hardest thing so far in my life and tell my best friend when driving at the mo I’m playing out driving into an oncoming car and get the urge to, or how much I wanted to launch myself of the road last night. I cried thinking about telling him because he just doesn’t deserve it and is a good person and friend but I had to. I think this has hit me as I’m in a good place or I’d be in real real trouble. But f me. I’ve never met a human like it why was it my one. Im at the bottom tomorrow will be better I’m sure. I cut and I’m ashamed of it embarrassing ashamed and weak. A quick dressing for work and back to the fakery just like her and my life was. Flippant nothing. Everything I had. Was nothing. 20 years of trying to prove yourself and saying I love you everyday, I hate myself. Nice guy finished last. As Robin said the saddest people try to make others happy because they don’t want you to feel like this. Im a tool. Sorry hope your having a better month.  I think my mum and Nan are the only reasons I can’t, that just breaks me to think about. Nvm back to the office.

"Ever since highschool I have a problem with procrastination. I would get homework and do it during recess the hour before. I would study for a test an hour before and so on. The only thing that I would not postpone would be peojects because it required multiple people and I enjoyed the process. Fast forward a bit, Covid hit and we were all sent home for months during my last year of highschool. The teachers did not annoy us with homework because they wanted us to just study for the Baccalate. I ended up studying in the week before and somehow passed it with flying colors.

I started University and now my procrastination is horrible. Online classes are the bane of my existance: i sleep during all or most of them. However, I was still quite motivated in the beginning, so I was doing some of the work. In the end, I pass the year, but without all the credits. 

Second year comes and now covid is on and off. I don't go to all of the lectures honestly I don't know why. I pass all the projects but simply don't go to a bunch of exams because I didn't study in time for them and I tell myself that there's no way I'm going to pass them, so I just skip them and tell myaelf I will study for the retake. The retake comes and passes and the same thing happens. I got enough credits to start year 3.

During year 3 we have a semester of courses and a semester of working on an internship. I passed all the courses from the 1st semester but I did nothing to recover any credits from my previous years. I enjoyed the internship and worked a lot for the company, but did nothing so far for  the required research project from the university. I have 3 days to finish a draft and presentation with all the info and I've done nothing. Because I didn't recover enoigh credits from the past years, i can't go on to my last year of uni and have to redo year 2.

My parents and my boyfriend know nothing of this, but now I am forced to tell them since I will be graduating (hopefully) a year late. I plan on telling my boyfriend next week and my parents, I don't know yet. I am very scared of their reactions and them being disappointed in me and potentially my boyfriend leaving me (he's a very good guy but this is very shameful in my opinion).

I am at my wit's and and don't know how to even start solving this problem. Any suggestions? Please be kind in the comment."	Ciorbica17	post	16.919578018999857	female	White	0.996559202671051	na	na	na	1	depression_help

"My mother visited a long time ago and drove into my neighbours car and drove off, they came straight for me even though it was nothing to do with me, I gave my mothers details straight away and called her numerous times on her drive home to please come back! I apologised profusely! It was like an angry mob at my door! Now anytime me and SO leave the house and they’re outside they will only say hello to him and ignore me. 

We were not together at all really, the only time we are is when I/he comes home to bed after work, our shifts finish at 5am, so the other would still be in bed. Recently we have dropped our Sunday shifts and spend some of Sunday together. We both worked 4 days a week opposite days (overlapped on Sunday’s which is why I had to drop it), already there’s a financial strain so he may have to go back to 4 days.

That's sad. Don't worry much about the neighbours. We all have messy relationships at least once. Maybe you can put notes for each other,  also listen to him how he feels about the relationship and the work. Also can communicate through the phone during break time in the office like I am doing right now. You need to have a deep conversation with him on this.

I am from Nepal and came to USA as a F1 student during 2021 Winter. My family doesn’t have a good financial status. I have one sister. My mom is the only person who earns in the family. My dad used to work but now he is over 60. My parents did all they could to keep me and my sister happy. They sent me to USA and my sister to Australia just so we could live a better life. But after I came to USA everything changed. I did struggle a bid to adapt at first but somehow i did it. I moved to Dallas from Erie, PA. I was doing some under the table jobs and working out my expenses and my tuition fees. I know i am not allowed to work as a F1 student but I have no other choice. I don’t want to depend on my parents to fund me even after they did so much to send me here. They are barely making their own living. But its been around 3 months that i had to leave my job as a gas station cashier. And i haven’t been able to find a new job. I have to attend at-least 12 credits in college to maintain my status to be legal in USA. I try to think about my future and just get frustrated knowing that I barely have any skills. I do have good grades but thats all there is to it. I haven’t learned anything skillful. I just pass the exams but whats the point. I feel kind of lonely too and miss my parents. I do talk to them twice a day but no being able to be near them has started to take toll on me. I just cry sometimes. I used to have some suicidal thoughts even back in Nepal but now its been more frequent and more intrusive.

"I completely understand some of what you may experiencing. I just moved away from Texas. I came back to my home state. I lost my job and completely isolated for four months. A part of me was embracing it and another was diving straight into depression. I stopped taking my medications because I couldn’t afford them anymore and I’m struggling trying to figure out where my feelings are deriving from. I also just found out that this feeling I’ve had for the past eight months is called passive ideation. It explains how I’ve been feeling every moment of my life. 

I came back to my mothers and I currently have no job, and I can’t afford to go back to college to get my bachelors. 

I gave up all hope but the only thing I’m holding on to and hoping to have help come in from is from GOD. I am so tired of this and I am calling for his help. I know if he somehow gives me strength to apply to medical I might be able to get help for this. 

I’m glad you are actively seeking help. What you are going through is difficult to read and I can imagine you must feel worse living it yourself. Keep looking and I’m sure people will give you better pointers. You are not alone. Even when it’s quiet and dark, you have people who understand and want you to get better. 

I’m over the happy go lucky positivity but I’d love to hear of an update with an amazing story as to how you over came it. Don’t cut yourself short just because you haven’t held a typical job. God always provides. I will say a prayer for you. For your peace and strength during these difficult times.

had problems with finances, almost all the problems that life can bring seems to be thrown at me.

yet through all this i had to smile in front of my kids and my wife for they see me as a warrior who will keep fighting to the end.

"I’m 28(f) and I still haven’t been able to figure things out and I’m really overwhelmed by all the thoughts and ideas swirling around in my head. I get so excited when I get a new idea but then something in me comes around and knocks the wind out of my sales. It gives me some reason of why I can’t do it.

Whenever I feel like I’m on a good steak and getting better something, or in myself I get this very dark and nagging sadness that drags me back down again. As I’ve gotten older the more confused I’ve become about everything and I don’t feel like the person I used to be. I often wonder whats the point of life at all. 

I’ve been getting so jealous seeing people going to college or talk about their degrees. I never felt like I was smart enough to get where I wanted to be because I had such a hard time focusing and get a lack of motivation. I’ve had people try to help me but I also feel like there’s been so many around me that have made me feel down and I don’t trust anybody anymore. 

I think school is almost pointless and a waste of money. I feel like I can learn things on my own without being rushed and earn money. But it’s hard to choose something let alone not feel like a waste of life. I get stuck in my head and it’s hard to get out. People tell me I have a lot going for me but I don’t feel like I do.

"I'm really sorry you're feeling frustrated. It's so isolating to feel like you're not where you're supposed to be or that you don't fit. Some of the best advice I can tell you is to stop comparing yourself to anyone else. The only person you should compare yourself to is who you were yesterday. 

I didn't go to college until I was about your age, I had just barely learned to drive a few years before that, and I felt like I was so much further behind everyone else my age with so many things. But when I started taking classes I met people who were in their 80s as well as people fresh out of high school, we were all learning the same thing and age didn't make a difference. 

I had no idea what I wanted to pursue as a major so I just started taking classes that interested me and went on from there. And you know what? After I graduated with my chosen major I still didn't end up choosing that as a career. But learning makes me happy, and so that's what I did. I drifted to different jobs for a few years and then a great job fell into my lap and I moved three hours away to grab it (I'm still there, just passed my five year anniversary).

My point is, anybody can start something at any age. You aren't behind anybody, I promise. We're all just trying to move forward. Do what makes you happy and you'll find where you're meant to be.

That's hard to say. It could be depression but you might just be jaded with life because you just stay in your room. Try to do something outside, like walking and exploring while taking in the scenery. Tell me how you feel then, if you feel no better than you feel at home, then I'd say you're depressed. I saw your comment and I'm really sorry about what's happening and has happened. You got to try and compare how you felt before and after those things happened. Try and compare how you feel sitting at home and going outside and walking and exploring. I can't tell how sad you are. I know you had a couple family health problems, and that wouldn't feel good but I just can't tell how deeply it affected you. As to whether cheek biting is self harm, I mean technically it is but it's whether you do it instinctively or on purpose. If it's on purpose, then I would consider that real self harm. If you do it without realizing, like I do then, I wouldn't consider that real self harm but just try to cut it down. It's a bad habit to do instinctively, and even worse when it's on purpose.

"Okay, this is a bit of a rant, but for those who need info before answering the question, here it is. Not required, but there for those who want it.

Been going to therapy for a while now. Every single time I go, my therapist tells me to try some self talk. I've told them that I have, and it never seems to work. Now, I think I know why. When I chose to be atheist in my Lutheran family, my mom told me that I had to be Lutheran because other Lutherans would treat me differently and that I should've push my beliefs on others. I wasn't going to and she herself is being hypocrital for telling me not to push my beliefs on others while telling me that I HAVE to be Lutheran. I had a feeling she was trying to protect me, but none of the other Lutherans I saw at a Vacation Bible School I volunteered at cared. It felt more like my mom didn't like the fact I chose to be atheist. Then, today, my hair was a mess(I chose to grow out my hair as a dude because I wanted to try something new). My entire family started tossing jokes about how I look liked that character or the next, characters that are always hated on for their hair. Normally, I don't get bothered by this if it's from friends, but since this was from family so suddenly after they were being nice to me just hurt. From there, I started thinking about all the other times I've favored others opinions more than my own. I've tried to express to my family things that I like, only to be made fun of for it. Then, I lose interest because I didn't want to be made fun of. And, anytime I mention that these things hurt, they ignore me and later tell me to tell them if anything is wrong. And when I do, they ignore me again. And, if I try to joke about things that they like, they all blow up and scrutinize things I like. I'm kinda just forced to like what they all like. If I don't and tell anyone about it, I get backlash. If I try to get into something they used to be into, I get backlash. It's a repeating cycle and it hurts each and everytime that it happens. Why do I care so much what they think?

TL;DR: My mom is a little upset that I'm atheist and tells me to be Lutheran. My family makes fun of things that I do or like and if I joke about something they like, they get mad. It hurts everything something like that happens because it makes me feel like I'm alone. Why do I care what they think about me?"

so the manager had told me a customer had said they saw me hit the car….another employee saw i was a bit upset…he asked me did i actually hit the car…i told him what happened. Then he said it wasn’t a customer who told the manager…it was an employee. Then he had said to just be careful who you talk to around here. I really never thought i did anything to have someone wanna get me gone. It’s only been my second day. When i walked back the guy who had told me who told on me and another guy just told me i had nothing to worry about…asked if i was ok and stuff. Went to go put the keys back and the guy who actually had told on me was asking “was i ok oh your just putting the keys back ok.” I was disgusted but i didn’t show any signs of it towards him. kinda a odd day to say the least.

"So, I hope this is beneficial but it may not be. It just hurts for me to hear how others hurt, so I’ll try to help with something that really helped me grow. 

To start I just want to say I can imagine how difficult things are for you and your initiative to connect with someone who has been through similar things is commendable.

To the point. My suggestion sounds like bullshit shallow rehab crap, I get it. But the key as to why that is bullshit and my suggestion can be profoundly impactful lies in the intention and the approach. 

1. Pick any art form that makes sense for you. Even if you feel you have always been bad at it and you have no talent at all. (I think pencil drawing would be an unwise place to start). For me it was woodwork followed by painting. Woodwork always felt right, but painting was big time out of my comfort zone. Remember there are a lot of things that are art ( anything being created, and expressed by the artist) so Culinary, writing, music, jewelry making etc etc.

2. Look online or wherever and find someone in that field that you admire and consider to the best and unbelievably talented. Pick one of their piece.

3. Now you don’t need to copy it but just use it as a guide and inspiration. Prepare yourself, be calm and don’t think about it as a whole. They painted (etc) it one brush stroke at a time. Now and this is what makes all of the difference in the world and why I have spent so much time writing this. Begin creating your art with the knowledge that there is ABSOLUTELY NO TIME LIMIT and you can if needed paint one stroke a day at a time till your finished. It could take 20 years but if you are patient and careful and intentional, even if you have zero talent, I can guarantee you will end up with something so far beyond what you expected yourself capable of creating that will change the the whole perspective you have on yourself, and more. 

The feeling of accomplishment and disbelief in what your mind and hands have created is something I wish everyone could experience. And really that scratches the surface of what you can take away from it. 

I’m a down to earth logic person and I don’t believe in a practical sense that anyone can do anything. It’s just not true. However if you take that concept and remove the concept them accomplishing it in a time frame, and then can teach themselves patients. Ya I would say that flips that entire dynamic. Could I sculpt a Greek statue… nah now way in a practical sense. If you give 200 years to figure it and go as slow as I need to, you bet your ass I could"	red_sweet11	reply	na	na	na	0.998055100440979	weak	no	no	na	depression_help
Get help first. Then get busy. You can create, like the previous person suggested, or join some social group, see what's around in your area. Get out: walk, run, bike, rollerblades... Whatever.. Exercise does help, just the activity itself, but also look around at houses, buildings, people, etc. This will take you out of yourself for a while and you'll see the world isn't that bad, and life can be fun. Stay open to new things, you'll be surprised at what you will find. Never give up, never surrender! (Galaxy Quest😁)	red_sweet11	reply	na	na	na	0.998055100440979	no	no	no	na	depression_help

I (23M) feel like I'm starting to fall back into a depression pit and don't know why or what I can do to avoid it. I struggled with depression slightly in HS but it didn't really become a problem until Undergrad. For 3-years I has extremely depressed. I didn't take care of myself, abused substances to escape, made no real friends, and retreated into myself. By my 4th year, I made an effort to make life changes. I entered a relationship, graduated, and ingrained new healthier routines in my life (gym & home cooking). Over these 2 years, I've felt happier and more in control with my life, yet over the past month and a half, I've had this old familiar feeling creep back in. I'm having trouble describing the feeling but now everything feels like a facade. Like, when out with friends or at work I would be genuinely happy and smile but now it all feels fake, like I'm putting up a show. The thought of packing up all my things to leave and escape somewhere always feels present in my head. My thought is, I've done all the things people advise you to do when your depressed -- and it worked for a bit -- but now I feel myself creeping back to a place I don't want to return to. Has anyone else been through something like this? How do you navigate and correct course?	whatsheatmiser	post	25.208467364362594	male	White	0.9972361922264099	na	na	na	3	depression_help

I have experienced times when it feels like depression is creeping back into my life. A therapist told me that in a strange way depression, as painful as it is, provides a degree of comfort because I know what it is, and I know what to expect. Depression allowed me to fall into myself like falling into a self contained cocoon. I also struggled with substance abuse when depressed. Depression gave me an excuse, and that made it appealing. Guided meditation got me out of patterns of depressive thinking. Guided meditation helps to establish new mechanisms for processing depressive thoughts. You see the thoughts, recognize them, but you don’t become attached. You allow the thoughts to pass. There are some excellent guided meditations for depression on YouTube. If you practice with a few of these meditations each day, you will find yourself able to move past the negative thoughts that you are experiencing. You will return your mind to the better life that you have created. There are many tools to manage the reemergence of depressive patterns of thinking. I’ve found that guided meditation is a powerful tool in the battle against depression. You absolutely can move past these thoughts and continue to live your best life.	whatsheatmiser	reply	na	na	na	0.9972361922264099	no	strong	no	na	depression_help
"It is easy to slip back and depression sucks, but then again, spending time inside you head can be a plus.  Getting rid of the stinking thinking helps, if you start to spin down and trap your self, you need to stop and look at the positives.  It may not seem like we have any, but we do.  Introspection can be a good thing, letting it pull us down is not.  

Being 23, you are still young, do not let you disappointments drag you down.  Most successful people have failed many times.  They learn from that experience, through introspection I believe. Have a ""lessons learned"" time with yourself and apply this to your thinking/attitude.

Focus on your positive aptitudes, capabilities and use them as much as you can.

Try doing things for others as well.  Helping, mentoring, etc others will make you feel better about yourself and take your mind off of yourself. 

So you mentioned that you made positive changes in your life for short term relief.  Great, but you may have to get help with medicine, your depression may be long term and an imbalance in your body.  There is no shame in taking this next step to medication.  It works better than self medicating with drugs or alcohol.  I know, wish I had the money I wasted on alcohol over the years and I and 3x your age.  Medication may be needed and again there is no shame, but excercise release the feel good chemicals in you body, so get back to excercising.  I know how hard that can be when depressed.  But I am now 50 less than when self  medicating

I dont understand social cues as good and i dont know what it feels like to be an adult or act like an adult since I still feel like a child .

"You don't need to overcome autism. In fact, it's not even possible because that is just how our brains work. It is not a bad thing, it just doesn't fit societal expectations, but who said those are a good thing, anyway?

Don't compare yourself to others, you never know their life story etc., the others might go through some stuff too and just not show it. And some people have too much going on, so that makes it harder to focus on stuff like work, social life etc., leading to different results for the same effort. 

What helps even it out again is getting help, like therapy, not just asking random strangers on reddit.

Also how do you know that they already made so much money? If they openly talk about it, they likely just want to brag/are exaggerating, and if they didn't say it then how do you know? Most of their money could be from their family. 

Clubbing/partying etc. are also not a must. Some people like it, some don't. I sometimes go to certain events, but it's mostly theme parties (80s etc.). Usually I don't because of overstimulation. 

I'm doing most things alone as of now, and I like it tbh. I've found activities I enjoy (for example bouldering) and enjoy the freedom of doing whatever I want whenever I want without even thinking about what others would think. You could try this approach too.

Plus, If you're actually comfortable in a place, chances are higher you'll find like-minded people with shared interests:)

For balding there are also multiple options: 

1. Finasteride/Minoxidil/whatever else there is, ask a doctor
2. Wigs/idk what to call those things that only replace the top
3. Shave your head and rock it
4. Hair transplant later on if you want/can afford it"	Business_Window_6232	reply	na	na	na	0.9925343990325928	no	no	no	na	depression_help
"I started battled depression over 10 years ago.  Many times I felt stuck  and it would never get better.  But I did all the right things.  I started counseling, took anti-depressants and committed myself to  changing myself and my life for the better.

My  journey has been almost like a scientific experiment.  I tried a whole lotta different things, in terms of lifestyle choices and attitude, and  then evaluated what worked and what didn't.  I had some very pleasant successes.  I also had some quite painful setbacks.  Either way, every  month I would report back to my counselor on my progress and get his  feedback.

Basically, I had to take risks.  I had to put myself out there.  I had to try new things.  That's hard.  But I was determined to make the effort and do whatever it takes.

I had so many ups and  downs, but over the past year I really have started turning the corner.   I got into local community theater.  I just auditioned for a lead role in an upcoming show and got the part.  It's not Broadway or Hollywood,  but it's good enough to make me happy.

For those of you struggling with depression I feel your pain.  I can't  emphasize enough though that it does get better.  But there are no  simple answers or easy fixes.  We have to ***DO THE WORK!!***

I’ve dealt with depression for over 10 years but just recently I got kicked out of the center I used to go to, and now I’m pretty much in my room on my bed alone all day. I know having friends to do things with wouldn’t make the depression go away, but I just feel so alone like there’s no point of even living anymore if I don’t have people in my life. I don’t go to school and don’t have a job, neither of those are a option for me right now, so how do I meet friends? Being alone all the time makes my depression and suicidal thoughts worse.

It can absolutely get better. There are many approaches to controlling depression, the difficult  part is finding the techniques or treatments that work for you. Persist in seeking a path through your depression. You are much stronger than you know. If you have tried therapy and/or medication and it didn’t help, find a new therapist with a different approach, and try different medications. There are also studies going on in many areas with new approaches to treating depression, explore options in your area. Guided meditation can help manage depression. It acts on neurotransmitters in the brain, and creates new pathways of thought and emotion. There are excellent guided meditations on YouTube that are specifically for depression. Guided meditation is not a quick fix, but if you practice consistently each day after a few weeks you should start to notice improvement. It took time for you to develop pathways of thought and emotion that result in depression. It will take some time to unwind your  negative pattern of thought and perception, but if you stay with guided meditation it will start to do so. Depression is a problem of the mind, your mind. Guided meditation acts on the mind in a unique and powerful way. Give it two weeks of daily practice ( several times a day is best), and see if it helps. The point is that thousands of people overcome depression, and you can too. Keep fighting to live your best life. You have a lot to offer this hurting world. We need you at your best. I’m praying that your life is filled with new blessings, deep peace, and great purpose. You will get better.	WeeklyNegotiation927	reply	na	na	na	0.9984138011932373	weak	no	no	na	depression_help

"It's hard to see things ""getting better"" when I'm in ""it."" Are you feeling any better that you've not only put this out there, but you're getting support in response? I hope so. And some really good ideas, too.

I have this list of affirmations that I think may be from a different 12 step group from where I actually got it. I had it memorized when I needed it at hand, but I'll try to get a copy here. OK, here we go....

First time posting ever so sorry if I screw something up.

I've been struggling with SI for a while now and it's started to get really bad. I went to the er in crisis last month and my hospital visit was unhelpful. I went in around 6 and wasn't talked to until 9 at which point they told me they didn't have a psychiatrist to talk to me and I needed to come back the next day. When I did return, they still didn't have a psychiatrist and instead gad me talk to a clinician. In between talking to the clinician and being allowed to leave I was in a room with a window looking into the main psychiatric ward and felt like a zoo animal for every patient and nurse to watch. Now I'm back in a slump and the SI has gotten worse than before. I'm not ready to kill myself but I know how ill do it when I'm ready. Because of my poor experience at a previous hospital I'm scared to talk to my family about checking in so I guess my question is at what point do I need to take that step?

"Hi, so I have Clinical Depression/OCD/GAD(General Anxiety Disorder).

I get so depressed or anxious it doesn't make me eat and I genuinely want to fix this habit of mine.

I only eat once a day and if I do eat it's snacks or I barely have the energy to make anything myself and I starve myself instead, I've been doing this for years. (Which I have realized is incredibly unhealthy and want to fix myself.)

Can I get advice on I can improve myself?

"Tough. I am also struggling with eating. Personally, you need to eat healthier. Like easy things. Fruit, maybe a healthy sandwich. Having things like vitamins and protein are going to improve your mood.

So if I may. Get some fruit like strawberries and other dark berries. Yogurt. Maybe some healthy cereal. And some stuff to make a nice sandwich.

Start with that maybe. If you need something quick you can get something simple.

Then try an eat a little more. Set alarms if you have to.

Try and eat in the morning at least. You're going to need it to improve your day.

Another option is get meal supplement shakes or make your own.

"My thoughts are based on my own experience, so my suggestions are what feels right for me, but I hope some of it makes sense to you, too. 

If you can't tell yourself how much better it is to have you in the world than not, ask your parents to remind you. Ask your mom or dad to call you every day to check on you. I'd strongly recommend finding a psychiatrist to talk to if you haven't already. If one doesn't suit you, get a different one. I had a rough experience looking for my first one. Man, I tell you, some of the sickest people are in the mental health field. If you haven't yet, I'd suggest thinking about (and working with therapist/psychiatrist) to create a plan or list of therapies to try next: meds? which one(s)? intensive outpatient program? inpatient?other support groups.... Some (eketamine, TMS) will be available only if several traditional therapies don't work. I'm definitely a proponent of better living through chemistry. It's your right and a necessity to advocate for yourself to get the support you need. YOU ARE WORTH IT.

I think it's awesome your mom showed up for you and you were able to see your therapist so quickly after asking for help. This is people showing you that you're worth the effort."	lookatnoodle	reply	na	na	na	0.0035863739904016256	no	no	no	na	depression_help

"Oh, this last time, I didn't. I was practically incapacitated. My mom really came through for me. It's a little fuzzy, but I may have given her the number for the depression center I already had a relationship with, and she got on the phone and...I don't know, ripped them a new one? I know she told them I was in dire straits and talked to (or at least got the attention of) the head of the dept. He called me, and I remembered being taken aback when he asked, ""What is it you want,"" or ""asking for"" or some such. Not in a defensive or mean way, but in a ""what can we do for you"" way. I remember I had to think for a moment, and I really can't remember what I told him. But I was stunned that someone was actually ASKING ME for an answer. And so then I had his number and an invitation to call him again if I needed to. That was like a lifeline being thrown to me.

I don't remember in what order this happened, but I was assigned a therapist I still talk with and a relatively new hire as my dr. There was an initial period with both of berating my previous PA/NP (who also had acted as my therapist and with whom the relationship had ended when she moved) about having prescribed and convincing me to stay on an anti-depressant that was literally trying to kill me. I also repeatedly told the dr. how mistrustful I was of getting any help from him. His manner was/is very gentle, and he asked me if I could attempt to trust him. I did and I do  And if I hadn't already had an ongoing relationship with my therapist, I would've continued the shrink stuff with him, too. I liked the perspective I got when talking to him about stuff, but he didn't want to potentially ""interfere"" with the established therapy relationship. I was disappointed but understood.

I'm crying as I write this because I can still connect to and feel so sad about the pain I was in. And I remember the littlest bit of relief I felt that I had been contacted by someone who was in charge and felt I was FINALLY going to get someplace where I might start to feel better.

I’m so sorry that you have to experience this, you deserve much better. Please remember that, and be good to yourself. Betrayal is a difficult thing to get past. It hurts to the core. Sometimes when things are going wrong in our lives, our friends are aware of it (often they know more than we think), but they don’t know how to help. They don’t know what to say or do to comfort us, so they avoid us. Don’t be too hard on them, they’ll likely reconnect as things settle down for you. You may want to talk to a therapist, it can help to sort out the complex emotions that you are processing. Guided meditation can also be very helpful in slowing the mind, processing emotions, and creating a more positive state of wellbeing. There are some excellent guided meditations on YouTube for anxiety, and almost any other emotional state.  Don’t give up on people. There are many trustworthy individuals that you will find as you journey through life. There are people who will support you through good and bad times. Keep your heart open to these people. You will hurt for a while, but you will move past this to live your best life. I wish you a life filled with new blessings, deep peace, and great purpose.

Unfortunately there is no magic answer to help either especially with a relationship that long. So all that being I will just keep my thought here brief and concise. 

1. Patience it is not a reflection of how much of a man you are based on how quickly you can bury this and move on. There is a real too long, but regardless give ur self the time you need to really understand and accept what happened.

2. * may or may not apply* talk to your parents about it. Honestly at 30 it doesn’t surprise me response you got from “friends” if it makes sense for you to do talk with them may help you feel a lot better than you would think.

3. Watch the good shit. (Crazy Stupid Love), (Hitch), anything that helps you remember still got it lol. 

4. Spend some time with no stimulation in the quiet by yourself and allow yourself time to just think

I have depression you the whole brain chemical imbalance bs cuz my brain can’t self regulate on its own. That makes me broken I don’t function normally. This thought hits me so incredible hard when I’m feeling super low and all I can’t think is why am I broken inside. What happened to make me this way? Some repression memory that’s running through my head subconsciously without me knowing, or maybe I was just born with a biological imbalance caused by nothing of my past. Im so sick of feeling broken. I just really needed to get my thoughts of my head because tonight I’m yet again feeling broken, but letting this out makes the current feeling less suffocating.

Great day at work. Soccer game with my family. Youngest played, oldest watched with us and hung out with a group of older siblings. Talked to a girl I graduated with for a few minutes after the game and some parents. I feel like I put on a show. Concerned parent, loving spouse, good friend, good employee, and then I get home and it gets real. I worry about whether I said the right thing, did the right thing, did that seem weird? Does everyone secretly hate me? What would they think of my house if I ever invited them over? Why can't I take care of all the things I should? Why did so and so make that face? Is it even worth it? Would anyone really miss me?	scarlettrose1020	post	30.840108992168155	female	White	0.9909612536430359	na	na	na	4	depression_help

"Those thoughts that tell you those questions are lies your depression tells you. It sounds like you had a great day at work and quality time spent with your loving family. Make that the focus. Write about it. Reflect on it with your spouse. Do things that will turn your focus towards the positives that have happened. Not the negative “what if’s”. Those are the lies our depression tells us. Remind yourself of that from time to time. When an anxious thought comes, tell yourself that that is not your thought. Then step back and create your own thought. You mention the thought about saying or acting the right way. I too struggle with that. So stop yourself when it comes up and reassure yourself. That you are ok. You said and acted the right way in whatever situation. And maybe you slip up, that’s ok. Note that for yourself and learn from it for what you can do differently next time. 


It might be helpful to look into methods of being more present in your life. I’m just a stranger on the internet, but from the short bit you’ve written, perhaps anxiety takes you away from the present moment to think about all the “what if’s”? Learning how you can immerse yourself in all of life’s events can help put your focus onto what you’re currently doing and away from the things that might or could happen. 

Please know you are worth it. You aren’t putting on a show. All those things you listed. You are all those important roles to yourself and to others. And that’s something special.

"Hello! I (21F) am going through some life changes. I’m entering my senior year of college and have started perusing grad programs, of which are going to be strenuous and expensive. 

I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety since about 17, which is when I started attending therapy. At 19, I was institutionalized and put on medications to manage depression. I’ve been on: 
Prozac: got off because it did not help
Lexapro: this was good, except for EXTREME fatigue 
Effexor: got put on this to participate in a clinical trial for a depression drug. Hated it/did not work so I left the study. Doc kept me on 225mg of Effexor and added 2mg abilify—this was absolutely terrible. Then doc prescribed seroquil—again, terrible. 

Now I am on nothing and just going about life. I attend therapy and genuinely feel okay. However, knowing that these life changes are coming, I’m scared for myself and fear that I will spiral into a deep depressive episode. I am going to see my psychiatrist soon.

I was wondering if anyone had any input as to what I should seek out from my doctor. Are there any meds that worked especially well for you? Should I continue with just therapy and skip medicine?

"Follow-up post kinda.
Just had the appojtment with both my social worker and the psychiatrist, I was nervous going in, thought they might have me committed at worst but hoped there'd at least be some form of support, instead with this psychiatrist it's always just pointless back and forth getting stuck unnecessarily due to mutual misunderstanding.

 I went in tryjng to find ways to keep living but make it bearable since I don't actually wanna live, just doing it for other people. Instead there was no support, useless back and forth wasting time, some things I would've liked to talk about didn't have a chance and now as opposed to before I am actually leaning heavily towards killing myself again because they had zero useful input. Useless because they don't understand me, they don't understand my situation, they don't understand the world.

I wanted to try more meds which were previously recommended, but said I didn't have any hope or expectations of them working so she shut me down just based on that. Apparently willingness to try is not enough. 

All I needed to hear was, ""ok, you've decided to live, let's try some things to make it a little more bearable"", but I got fuck-all. All I needed was a hand to pull me just one step farther from the edge, instead what I got was ""shit, yeah that's a ledge your standing on, guess there's nothing we can do""

So, instead of amping up your plan, take your life in your hands and find better help. From your post, it sounds like you'd prefer to live, which is BIG!

If you're finding it hard to find help on your own, ask someone in your life for assistance. If you aren't in a network, try your local mental health clinic or community help organizations for referrals. Or try people you know who are in therapy where you're impressed by how they've been able to change.

I find it's a really hard thing to reach out for help, especially when I feel so let down by so-called professionals who were supposed to help me. I wish I had some magic words to make things feel better for you. Absolutely do those things that you know help or bring you even a smidgen of joy: play with your cat, eat ice cream (That's my favorite go-to.), read the comics or a funny book, take a bubble bath, go out shopping just to have some interaction with people.

To truly understand another person you must first understand yourself. 

Carl Jung did a fantastic job of bridging this gap through his concept of the shadow, something Jordan Peterson speaks a lot about. 

The fact you need a rage room means you're likely holding a lot of resentment towards yourself: there are specific things you disdain that you wish to change.

If this advice isn't the right thing for you totally okay, but when I'm in this place I need to document ways to take future action.

I guess I can’t say I’m happy now that I’m larger but I’m more stable. But it’s also making me even more depressed. But antidepressants are the only way I can be in a relationship.

One of the things I did in getting help was working out a safety plan with my psychologist.

"I don't think there is any one thing that helped, but this little story has contributed ...

on my journey to the top the mountain to healing, I will occasionally go down into a valley (feel low). At some point in time the valley comes to and end and starts to rise again. And as I come out of the valley, I may find another path to the top that is easier than the initial path.  Even when I go down into the valley, I an not as low as when I started (say, with no help).

"I've been where you are, unfortunately, and I'm still breathing. Not hurting family has seen me through the worst times, but the idea of ending myself hasn't gone away. My main problem is a failing marriage, but there is also depression/anxiety. We know very little about your circumstances, other than you own a cat, and you'd rather be dead. The question is why would you rather be dead. You say it's been years of treatment and meds and nothing has worked; this still begs the question, why? What is it about your life, your continued existence, that you can't bear? Was there trauma? Abuse? Loss? Bullying? Where are you now? Working? Disabled? Keeping to yourself? Are you socially active? I'm sure you've been over all these things with your doctors, but have you really sat down with yourself and thought them through? Written it all out? I've got a ""reason"" for wanting out.

I'm in the same boat where I've wanted to die for a long time but feel like I can't do that to my partner, dog, and couple of close friends. 

When things are going well, it feels like it's because everything is just a distraction from how I really feel. Sometimes it's easier to be distracted and and other times (in the valleys) it's like it's all I can think about. When I'm in the valley it is comforting to remember that my feelings aren't linear, my progress isn't linear either, and I will be going back towards the peak again soon."

"Btw, I saw your post about the therapist - change them! We all go through a lot before we find a good one. To be honest though, I gave up and just looked up how to be happier on my own because it was more useful :(

You just turned 30, I would give it some time. For a lot of people the worst is in their 20's, myself included. After I turned 30 a few years back, my life was so much better.

You have people who care for you, and you care for. It's worth the effort to see a few more years of your 30's out. It seems impossible, but do what you can to keep your mind occupied on little things that make you happy or will get you out of your head, like eating you favorite foods, watching a movie, going for a hike (this surprisingly helps).

I personally found that reading about the meaning of life, what is life, what it means to live and going down that rabbit hole really helpful. At first I was skeptical, but eventually I started to do gratitude exercises in the morning and figure out why I wanted to live.

You talk about your self-loathing issues and meditation is the best way to get out of it and quiet that negative narrative that's going on in your head. That was the only thing that worked for me.

If you want to do something even more drastic as a last measure, I can recommend a free 10 day silent meditation retreat that a lot of people have gone to that changed them. It was a great retreat that talked about how the mind works and was really helpful in understanding my negative thoughts and reactions, why I keep gravitating towards these habits and how to break out of it.

It's awesome that you are trying and even thinking of your cat (who will notice your absence), it seems far away but you will find a way out of it and be happy."	PhanThom-art	reply	na	na	na	0.9899582266807556	weak	strong	no	na	depression_help

I have recently been in the worse mental state I have been in since my suicidal thoughts era half a year ago. It has been going pretty well since then, went on anti-depressants, have therapy once a week, and i got blessed with a supportive family and amazing friends that have backed me up during all of this. But as of recently my parents forced us on this trip back to their home country, which usually is fine and at first I did nit make too big a deal of it. As soon as I arrived it clicked to me that now I have no therapy for a month, I am as far as i can be from my friends, and my parents are too happy here for me to bring up how badly i want to head home. It has not been too long since I got here so I don't know if I just need to stick it out a bit longer but all I can think of is home, my home, where all my friends are and where I am familiar with the area around me. It doesn't help that I am not close with my extended family as their is a bit of a language and cultural barrier between us. I really got no idea how to deal with this and I have been crying for the first time in months and i am just lost. If you guys have any suggestions on how to deal with this it would be much appreciated.	theboyslooklikebeens	post	34.48891147304652	male	White	0.9980327486991882	na	na	na	2	depression_help

Im really feeling hopeless, lonely. So so so lonely i want someone to hug me, talk to me, tell me its ok. I know once im done crying i will sleep. Maybe in the morning ill call my doctor.

You are a person of value who is struggling mentally and economically, I’ve been in that place. You are much stronger than you think. You’ve endured a lot, and have had the strength to survive. You have an inner drive that sustains you. You have abilities, insights, talents, and skills that you can use to create income. Keep searching for work. Seek out free mental health services. Depending on where you live you may find clinics or hospitals that will treat you if you let them know that you are having suicidal thoughts. Reach out to anyone that you can think of for help and support. Look for any economic support programs where you live including temporary shelter services. There are social service agencies in many regions, try to find the one that services your location. You can get better, so many of us have. Things are dark right now, but you can move through this. You can still live a life of purpose and meaning. Draw on all of the strength within yourself, and try to find help.

it truly ruined my life. i attempted and almost left. i wish i did. i fucked up in my last year of college but i graduated, but now i don’t wanna work, i don’t want anything from this life.

what made it so so much worse is months ago my mom was diagnosed with glioblastoma. now she can’t talk or walk and can barely eat. it’s my first time facing this reality but i am losing my mom too.

what do i have to live for? why live the worst life ever after being such a happy motivated life-loving person?

Remember the times when you needed to do the task in a timely manner such as paying bills on the last day, going to get a certificate for something on a predefined date, preparing for the interview on a predefined date. We don't ignore the above tasks and do it compulsorily. We don't give ourselves a choice to do or to not, we do it perfectly. No excuses. "" So motivating right?

People need to understand depressed people are *not* ungrateful. More often than not, we feel like we deserve nothing good. 

I've been learning a lot about neurology, and how simple wiring in our brains affect emotion. 

One thinv my pysch told me years ago is that when you feel one negative thought....immediatrly think 10 positive ones. The reason is - if you were having brain imagery done at that moment you would be able to see a light-up change in your brain. Those positive thoughts help to thwart off the downslide you feel when sadness sets in. It does help quite a bit. 

Be good to yourself. Don't kick yourself, ok? I know what it's like. And like a wise perdon once said - most of us are doing our best. 

That's true, right?

I'm looking up everything I can lately about microdosing with psilocybin or LSD (under a physician's watch, of coyrse) because thr studies show it creates new neural pathways in your brain. I met a man that microdosed overseas with psilocybin (he described his depression like mine) and he said the next morning he woke up and felt something odd....it took him awhile to realuze that *he felt amazing for the first time in 13+ years*.

I know a lot of folks who are talking about microdosing changing their life, this is truly amazing ! ( not legal in my country sadly ), I had the opportunity to do it when I was living in North America but I chickened out as I'm a highly sensitive individual when it come to substances even microdosage. I wonder if that could have helped me at the time. 

I feel like this is weird to say but It makes me feel better to know I'm around people who goes by the same emotions and life struggles as a whole. It feels like we are connected, I follow this brilliant mind on IG who's an artist and she is so raw and vulnerable about her journey it's inspiring, and even if we are not friends, we share messages and try to inspire others to be vulnerable and maybe, healing the collective one step at a time.

Despite the fact I don't feel a wide range of emotions, I do feel shame. I feel ashamed that I am in deep credit card debt that accrued while I was in my deepest depression. I do not currently have the money to pay them without a job though and don't know how to handle it.

Today all I wanted to do is just lay down. Some days are a bit better than others. But today, I don't want to move a muscle. I also feel some guilt for being this way. 

Financial stress somehow gets to me. All these institutions are after me as I neglected to pay things before. The shame and stress is so much that it gets in the way of enjoying life. I feel like I'm a criminal but I could not help I was depressed and didn't care at the time how I spent money I didn't have.

I am of course looking for jobs. But is there anyway to not feel so much shame?"	Paullearner	post	16.158231828184718	female	White	0.9983718991279602	na	na	na	3	depression_help

I get where you’re coming from, would a part time online job work for you? There’s some entry level IT work you can do from home where you just sort files. I did this for awhile when my anxiety was too bad for me to leave the house. It doesn’t pay the best but at least you could earn some money?

"alt account for this one, im 15M and i have black curly/wavy hair, i love having a small curly fringe sit on my forehead. its been getting kind of long and me and my dad and my mom were out, and we went to a turkish barber, (i went to him last time and it was decent) i told him to do it exactly like last time but a bit *LONGER*. Now it looks like i have a big lump of shit on my head, i told him to keep it curly, he brought it all back. There is nothing i can do now since i can only just wait. 

im not exaggerating when i say i have to mentally prepare myself to look in the mirror, ive had a breakdown 3 times already (im not that sensible, its the first time i cried in months)
and i got this yesterday, saturday and i have a match on monday, and im going out with my girlfriend on tuesday. she says it looks good
from snaps, but im afraid shes going to change her mind when she sees it in real life.

to give you an idea of how lobotomised this haircut is: imagine a facebook post of a pakistani kid, on his first day of school, with his uniform on, a forced smile and a forced haircut. I cant stand my face in the reflection of my phone. 
it completely killed my self confidence, im feeling suicidal, depressed and cant be bothered to do anything. and its going to stay like this for another month, even when it marinates its going to look terrible.

"My daughter had a similar reaction to a haircut she got where the hairstylist completely ignored the pictures she was shown and gave her a really short cut in a different style. The feelings you have right now are valid but the harm is temporary.

Odds are that no one will say anything bad to you about the haircut but if they do, blame the blame the barber. He didn't do what you asked him to, this is his fault, not yours. Don't be embarrassed.  Use this as a lesson and always show a picture to the barber in the future of exactly what you want and don't pay if they get it wrong.

As unhappy as you are right now, this will pass. Hair grows and feelings fade in time. Each day will get just a little bit better until this is just a distant memory."	Accomplished-Hat2986	reply	na	na	na	0.9994799494743347	weak	strong	no	na	depression_help

"Honestly, I've been giving myself haircuts as right now I can't afford to pay $40 bucks to go to the Barber I want to (and yes, I only trust him because supercuts never cuts it). Simply take a raizor and cut it all bald. That is, if you don't mind the buzz cut look. 

It's taken a few times but I've gotten better at giving myself a decent fau hawk. I know it's not for everyone but hey, I've at least saved a lot of money and I just shave it all off if I don't cut it to my liking. 

Aside from all that, I'm sure it's not all that bad. People are not as fixated on you as you think. Meaning, I see people on the street everyday that wear clothes or styles I'd never do and even sometimes find weird, but after they're out of my sight, I forget about them. I'm not sitting here thinking, oh what a disgusting individual blah blah blah. No, I just go on with my life.

Even if you think it looks weird, most likely people don't care as much as you think they do. Most of the time people are more concerned with themselves and what's going on in their lives. It's gonna be ok bro."	Accomplished-Hat2986	reply	na	na	na	0.9994799494743347	no	strong	no	na	depression_help
i get like this and at least for you it will get better, while as with some like me, it's gone permanently or destroyed permanently. If you mean it is too short and the shape is wrong, even this can be fixed. You need to wait until you are rational. You see, I am like that -- horribly horribly despondent and hopeless when I look like crap. Yet the next day or later on, it's not like much has changed, I don't think. So this means that we are letting our emotions alter our perception. Perhaps the perception has BASIS in fact but it is not ALL of the fact, you see? My theory is almost anything, even bad plastic surgery, can be fixed. It might not be immediately fixed, which we would want -- but it is fixable. I'm telling you, this is fixable. Since I can't see it or know the exact issue, I'm thinking it would help you to take a step back from the situation, mentally.

"Everything Paullearner wrote. Plus, hair is such a personal thing and if it goes wrong--and especially if it's tied to self-esteem--I know it is absolutely a miserable feeling: hurt, frustration, anger, knocked down. At least that's my version. Sometimes I spiral in it. Things that do help me: stopping looking in the mirror, having someone I trust tell me it looks just fine, telling myself hair grows (and then using oils and head massages to encourage hair growth), BREATHE. Tell yourself this isn't life or death. Find things to do to distract you from obsessing about your hair. Think how much more well off you are than so many other people.

I made a decision as an assistant manager. Ended up not being the correct one. First time I have been pulled into the managers office to explain myself and what I would do differently. The option of being fired was never brought up. Just that I might have to take the 100 dollar offage. I am ok with taking it as I messed up and so did the other two people but they are not managers. My mind starts going are they going to demote me, fire me, write me up, and so and so is not going to like you anymore. I was spoken to last Tuesday and am still waiting to hear if I am going to take full or partial offage. I get up in the morning with nerves shaking, mind racing 100 miles a minute, feels like fight or flight all the time.

"My sibling's holed themselves up in their room after graduation for two years now. They've been seeing a psychiatrist, but don't think psychologists work (tried without much success). They've had depression since their mid-teens, very likely from their gender non-conformity. It has never gotten this bad though. 

My mother's at her wit's end and doesn't know how to help them. She has her own baggage, and doesn't have the capacity nor bandwidth to help. Initially it wasn't this bad, my sibling used to go rock-climbing. But these days they just stay at home and don't go out, save for their psychiatric appointments.

"Depression (much like other mental health problems, substance abuse as well as diabetes,HIV, etc) are not necessarily things you can “pull yourself out of”. 

Now please don’t be discouraged by that statement. There is hope. 

With depression it’s about creating a system of “good habits “ while eschewing “bad ones”. It’s about being mindful of triggers. It’s about finding joy in hobbies, satisfaction in work, and fulfillment in relationships. 

Sounds like everyday normal stuff right? For people dealing with depression sometimes these things feel impossible. 

Perhaps you can offer small “Olive branches” (not that you are the aggressor) from a seemingly cold or hostile outside world. Cook a meal that they enjoy. Put on a song or a movie they love. Try subtle things to draw them out of their nest of despair. Maybe you can even write notes of support and slide them under the door so that they know someone outside that room is looking out for them in that big bad world. Once they come out, perhaps discuss memories that you are certain are positive for them. Invite them to places they like, just like the meals or the movies got them out of the room, this could have them rejoin the world. Maybe even invite them to go rock climbing.

Maybe you’re already doing a lot of these things. Whether you are or not, I commend and admire you. Diseases always leave collateral damage when it comes to loved ones. Thank you for caring for your sibling and please avoid your own despair by taking care of yourself too. 

This is not hopeless. It may be scary, frustrating, annoying, what have you, but it is NOT HOPELESS! Your sibling is seeking treatment, you (and maybe also your mother) care about them. That dear person is hope, and hope coupled with solid processes may not pull them out of this permanently, but it can create a solid foundation that keeps it from getting this bad again or even a whole new lease on life.

"This is my first post here and in all honestly I never thought I would be posting in a subreddit like this. My gf is currently struggling with depression/ anxiety after an exhausting month or so. Her university, and family matters have taken a toll and continue to do so. 

In all of that we haven't chatted a lot lately until a few weeks back where she told me she feels numb, feels nothing and also dont think she is ready to commit for marriage anymore. Despite telling me she loves me and wants to be with me, she feels marriage is a burden, a responsibility and something she cannot handle. Let me be clear we have had no issues in our relationship of one year. 

My response to this was to reassure her that I am with her and will stay by her side. I told her marriage is something we can talk about later but all I wanna do is be by her side and weather this storm together. Did I do the right thing? 

How do I make her feel better? I am willing to stay by her side and help her get better and beyond that.

My mum has got really bad depression. I’ve known this for a few years. 
Just yesterday, she got really upset and started talking about how she just wants to die and she doesn’t want to be here anymore. How she wants to overdose.
How she wants to go to sleep and never wake up.

I immediately rang my dad, who just told me she was just upset and to ignore her. 
Later that day, when my dad was home, I spoke to him about having my mum go to a mental health hospital. He said he’s been trying to get her to go for years, as she’s tried to kill herself multi times but she just won’t go.

My mum wants to take a trip soon, and my dad doesn’t know when she will be back. Nobody does. I’m scared she’ll try to overdose whilst she’s away.

Are mental health hospitals as bad as some say? And if not, how do I get her to go?
At the same time, will she be safe if she goes? What can I say/do to make her feel better?

I don’t want to just ignore what’s happening. ignore how she’s feeling. I want her to be happier."	Liamxyzz	post	22.902406644113345	female	White	0.9681127667427063	na	na	na	6	depression_help

"Sadly, there is not much you can do for your Mum--she needs to accept that she has a problem and wants to get better. You can urge her to get help, either at a hospital or a psychiatrist in an office. Maybe you could look up some doctors or hospitals for her--you and your Dad could sit her down and talk about your concerns for her.

As for the trip, there is no telling what might happen. You and your Dad could make her sign a 'no harm' contact before she goes. It could help, though it's not a guarantee. 

I feel for you, and for your Mum, as I know how difficult depression can get. Good luck."	Liamxyzz	reply	na	na	na	0.9681127667427063	weak	no	no	na	depression_help
I would see if there are possible treatments aside a stay in a mental hospital. Not because they might not be suitable, but because she needs help. If she’s reluctant to get treatment at a mental health hospital perhaps there is a doctor she can see, a support group she can go to, something that might ease her into to going to the facility to get proper treatment. Good luck.	Liamxyzz	reply	na	na	na	0.9681127667427063	no	no	no	na	depression_help

"My adopted mom was strict on me my whole life . It’s strange because a lot of the times I bring up the things she does she acts clueless or like she doesn’t remember. The church I went to would do weird things like me falling asleep the pastor made me stand in front of the church. My mom would talk about me during the word. She would make me go to church like 4 times a week she has dragged me down the hall by my hood one day because I refused to go to church. Once my mom found out a boy had done stuff with me but really groomed me and took advantage of me when I was like 12 and she made me sign a contract and threaten to send me to a Christian school and her and the pastor made me read books about why stuff was bad. I use to get in trouble and yelled at and spanked because I couldn’t stay still and I said I couldn’t and they said it was satan. And then they found out I had adhd they apologized for it. People would hang out with me and my mom would blast Christian music and scream to god and embarrass me for some reason. She made me go to a school far from my house and I’d have to sit in an office for 2-4 extra hours everyday for 3 years and my senior year I had double early release so I spent over $600 on Ubers home. Like one time I asked her to take me to a job interview and she just wouldn’t do it just because she didn’t feel like it but I feel like if I had a daughter I would do anything to help her. And the other pastor for church has a car but my mom for over 10 years has picked her up and took her to church because she’s convinced it’s a service to God. We go places in public and she says out loud you can’t afford this or I don’t have money loud in public. She is a hoarder and collects things and it’s been like this for years and every time I say she’s messy or needs to clean she gets mad at me and won’t admit she’s a hoarder. I’ve cleaned up areas in the house and she gets upset and then a couple days later apologizes. When I lost my virginity she was like everyone is going to think you’re a whore and I was like you’re calling me a whore and she was like no I’m saying everyone is going to think you are one. She always gaslights me and makes me feel like I’m wrong for being upset. She use to say stuff to me like here comes the boobs and like say she felt like she was sitting next to a pregnant person and not to be friends with gays and Muslims and all types of crazy things. She would throw away my clothes and posters without me knowing I would find it in the trash. She wouldn’t let me play basketball because she said I would turn into a lesbian.She has hundreds of books and has been a psychologist for over 25 years . When I turned 18 she stopped caring and I had to beg her to call
Me she would go weeks without talking to me and I had no clue how to be in the real world. I was very socially awkward and started dabbling into substances to be outgoing and feel comfortable and it caused permanent damage to my brain and memory. I eat very healthy now and have a strict diet and have good friends in my life that teach me things but it’s hard building on a broken foundation. I know how to talk to my mom now and when she starts being mean I just ask her to stop and tell her I don’t want to argue with her. It feels like she hates me there has been times where I’ve been stuck places and she didn’t help and she sees me struggling and refuses to offer a helping hand. This one time she lost my birth certificate and social and she was like if it’s not there then that means I lost it ? But she was keeping up with it it’s like she can’t take accountability for stuff ? And she had shut down my bank account that was attached to hers and didn’t tell me for some reason ? I don’t understand how she feels or why she feels the way she does towards me. I feel like I’ll never be enough for her I want her to like me I want to get over my mommy issues. I feel so bad for her because she use to live in california and be free spirited and travel and she’s just stuck in the hoarded house with our dying dog in the same routine. I really just want to get rich so I can fly her around and let her live out the life she feels like she’s losing."

"So my doctor (general doctor) prescribed me some SSRIs (Apo-Citalopram) not for depression but for anxiety. 

All went very well for the first 3 months or so. I began with 10 mg then 20 mg. All was well. But when my meds increased to 30 mg I began to feel depressed like I've never been before. I don't know if it's just a coincidence or what but since that time I just feel like dying. I have no will nor any intention to live much longer.

"Iv been struggling with depression for the last 5 years. But I'm finally going to get help at the end of the month and I was wondering if I could do something to keep my clam till then.
 In the beginning I was when I was getting get things were good but when covid hit I stopped getting help as a mix of not being able to see doctors in person and stress of losing my job. So for the last 3 years iv been struggling without help and the last 2 months after graduating college have been hell iv been unemployed for the last month and my depression has been keeping me down to the point I'm struggling to look for work. When I was leaving my last job I was driving fast and down the highway and not caring if I got in a wreck(first time that's ever happened). Lately iv been forcing myself to draw for an hour every few days and do an hour of walking every couple days it seems to be helping. It's hard for me to open up to people in my life.
I'm seeking help to lessen my depression episode or how to work my way out of them till I can find professional help in a little over a week. Comments are welcome and if this can go on a different sub please let me know and I'll go and find it."	ECVwheelz1858	post	28.22954025275084	male	White	0.8816230297088623	na	na	na	3	depression_help

"This will probably be a long rant as i have no one to talk to. if anyone can listen or provide support it would be greatly appreciated. 

I’ve been feeling out of it for a while but it’s more of a numb feeling than anything else. like nothing matters or nothing is interesting. It makes me feel like i’m not even depressed at all and i’m just lying to myself. I’ve been in really bad depressions before and since this doesn’t feel like one of those times i feel like i’m just making everything up. No one around me ever really sees me. I’m expected to clean up EVERYONES messes and expected to come around to peoples houses just to help with grocery shopping or babysitting kids. I’m never asked to come around just to hangout with the family or friends. My own girlfriend doesn’t even fucking acknowledge me half the time and the only time she does is when she needs something or wants to show me something. She ignores me when i’m crying yet never even notices when I am happy. she makes it so clear that she doesn’t care about me especially because she’s told me that all I am is negative. She only pays attention to me if I’m “negative” when half the time i’m trying to make fun plans for us, or talk about something fun. She doesn’t noticed those times. She’s never noticed how far i’ve come and grown. No one has. Even when i explain it and prove how far i’ve come i just get a “nice” in response. No one genuinely is proud or thinks i’ve made a difference. No one even tries to see it. I know how selfish I sound. I know it’s selfish to feel these ways but i don’t understand how i can be there for everyone ALL.THE.TIME. taking care of everyone and cleaning up after everyone, just to never be seen. I’m just viewed as peoples maid or as their little helper instead of as someone who needs some fucking help too. I don’t even mind helping everyone I just mind the fact that i am not a human being to anyone. I don’t think my girlfriend loves me and I know she doesn’t care for me, my family is mostly out of the picture because they never EVER cared for me, my dad is in the picture now and every-time I come around he’s just telling me horrible things about me or complaining that I eat too much food (when i barely eat at all) or telling me how stupid I am. I don’t have any friends I can hangout with. I no longer have a job. I am starting to hate myself so fucking much again. I am self loathing and it’s so so so stupid. I don’t want to feel this way. I want to punch a wall so hard my hand goes through it. I want my fist to shatter or something to break and maybe then someone will notice that i’m here too and that I need some help. I’m so tired of being alone even when i’m with the people I love. I don’t want anything in return. A simple thank you or i’m proud of you would be enough but i’m never given it. I’m so tired of only being seen as a worker and not a family member, or girlfriend, or friend, or person. I’m just someone to put all the problems onto. I’m so tired of it. I haven’t even explained the genuine deep troubles and pain of it all because it’s too much to try to put into words. This is all just the surface level and I feel so selfish for it. I’m just so tired. I don’t know what to do. I know that I don’t want to die, but at the same time i’m scared life will forever be like this. I wonder if by the time i’m in my 40’s maybe i’ll be used to it."	secret_opossum	post	12.342741961111138	male	White	0.9991050362586975	na	na	na	2	depression_help

"The best thing you can do for yourself is distance yourself from things that don't give you joy right now, or try to change the circumstances you're in. Make yourself heard, set some boundaries.  


First off, about your girlfriend. Why are you still with her if she makes you miserable for the majority of the time? Is there something that still makes you think that it could work if you were better understood by her? Or is it because you're afraid of being alone, or something else altogether?  
If you feel like there is still something there that makes you wanna pursue this relationship, I would suggest sitting her down and having a serious discussion about your feelings with her. I'd make sure to emphasize that this is how *you're feeling* to avoid making her feel like you're accusing her of not loving you, caring about you etc. because the reality is that unless she has very clearly told you that she doesn't care about you, you in fact don't know that for sure. I don't know how long you've been together or how well you know each other, but people can also come from very different upbringing and circumstances, which might be the cause for her not seeming to notice when you're trying to make those fun plans for you two or talk about funny things, or to especially notice when you're feeling negative or gloomy.  
Also, if talking face-to-face seems too difficult for whatever reason, you can always do these conversations via letters! Letters are a great option if you're afraid you might not be able to respond quickly enough or need more time to put thoughts and feelings into words, or are just afraid of how the other person might react.  


As for your family... I don't know how easy it is to distance yourself from them but you can always set boundaries for yourself. If you live with your family, it's definitely a little harder, but still very much doable. Does your family actually know about your depression and when was the last time you talked about it with them? Depression is often kind of invisible to an outsider's eyes. I would - again - have a talk with at least one of your family members, maybe with someone you trust in the sense that they're likely to actually listen to what you have to say and would make time for that. Remember, letters work communicating within family, too!  
Then the setting boundaries part. You are not obligated to do anything for anyone if you do not want to. It's okay to say ""no"", even if it leaves someone in a pickle. It's not the end of the world with the kind of things you're describing. This took me, like, about a decade to understand and accept, and it was hard as heck. In the end I'm very, very glad I did learn that, though, because it has taken a huge pile of potential stress off my shoulders and made it easier for people to understand that I care about myself enough to set time aside for myself, and they should care about that too.  


Last but not least: It sounds like you could really benefit from having therapy. Or if you already are at therapy, I would consider showing your therapist this post or discussing these feelings with them. And if you already have but it hasn't helped, try it again or consider switching to another one, as therapists are humans, too, and not everyone's views and communication skills etc. match up. :)  


I could ramble on and on and on about these kinds of things for hours, but I think I might be better off cutting this here... :D I hope I could be at least a little of help!"	secret_opossum	reply	na	na	na	0.9991050362586975	weak	no	strong	na	depression_help
Having no family support and not being able to afford a babysitter as I can barely work at home with two small (3 and 1) children are slowly but surely making my depression noticeably worse. (I 've had it on and off since I was in middle school. I'm 33). The exhaustion has been pilling up...I haven't had a proper break from being a mum for 3.5 years. I get occasional 1-2 hour free time here and there when my husband takes them out for a walk but that's it. I beat myself up for being depressed and tired and not being able to be a happy and joyful mum...I feel terrible and I've been barely holding on...depression does suck.

I have no idea what to do. We had planned our life ahead, we were so happy, but then earlier this year my cancer diagnosis came up, and everything went to shit and it’s my fault only because I was angry for so little reasons and yeah.. I wish I could fix everything but they didn’t give me a chance. My guess is everyone at work told him to dump me because I guess that’s what people do instead of talking properly and talking about our feelings… I am lost. In one day, I had to move out of our apartment with all my things, and I am alone, so lonely.. I don’t see a point in life, they fixed my life and got me out of a really bad depression so many years ago, my BPD symptoms almost disappeared.. But now I’m suddenly alone and hopeless and I have nothing. I am so sorry for being a burden to everyone but I just think this isn’t fair. I’ve tried being a good person my whole life, I trusted them with all my heart, and I feel so.. hurt, I can’t even explain it. I haven’t felt suicidal in so long because I was scared of death, but now.. I don’t even care if I die of cancer or I end it myself. I don’t see a point in life. But I understand them and why they left me. It’s plain suffering to spend time with me.. I just wish they wouldn’t listen to people’s advice but their own heart.. I just don’t see a point in life anymore. I lost everything. What should I do at this point, where nothing seems enjoyable? It’s very difficult to focus on nice things when yesterday morning we were chatting, all happy, but now I am laying in bed, alone, and they’re probably happy they got rid of me.. I feel like this is really not fair.	nikamiku	post	17.355490638413	female	White	0.9993083477020264	na	na	na	2	depression_help

I apologise for the NSFW flair. I feel that it was necessary. I have a really good friend online who I've been friends with for years on end. We were wildly different but still had alot of fun together. One day she stopped getting on. Now this happened before so I wasn't very worried. She lost power maybe, or is taking a break. But after a few days and becoming worried sick, I messaged her brother directly. He told me she had took her own life. Because of me. Since we were good friends we would insult each other. And I think I took a bit too far once. I was obviously saying what I said as a joke but they didn't take it as such. I now feel very depressed. I have been friends with them for years. We would game together and do more together. She said multiple times that she enjoyed my company. We loved each other and now she's gone. Just disappeared out of my life. And we never met. It makes me depressed. I wish I can turn back time. What do I do to feel better?	Mission_Possible_361	post	32.516633960145946	male	White	0.9942423701286316	na	na	na	2	depression_help

"Dear , pease take care of yourself. My deep condolences 

Don't blame yourself because there is never only one reason why people choose to take their own life. She was probably fighting a silent battle and with what you described, you helped shine light into her life by playing games and just hanging out.

Cherish her memory in whatever way you want.

Maybe it would bring you more closure to talk with her brother about her mental state before you died, but I can almost guarantee, it wasn't your fault. It is always a decision that is theirs to make.

" 

Backstory: i grew up in a rough household. Toxic and manipulative mother, who always made it a necessity for me to prove my worth all the time, to the point where making any sorta mistake seemed unaccepatble to me; lots of yelling and constant arguments between my parents; my mom has traits of a narcissist.

Even tho i have been stayed strong all my life, i gave in last year. I hit my rock bottom where even carrying daily simple tasks was a big deal. It was hard for me to get out of bed, and i had no idea why. My grades dropped, i distanced and isolated myself from my friends and family. And on connecting with a professional, i got diagnosed with clinical depression.

Present situation: I am way better than before, i am feeling better on most days, there are still really bad days but i think i have finally gotten a sense of reality and the world. And all of this came with a realization of the fact that i might not be the same anymore and its hurting me. I was always a very confident person, i won numerous debates, music competitions, got straight As, participated in every activity and did well in it. I used to be really pretty, i felt pretty, i was confident but now after dealing with the worst phase of my life, i feel like i have lost myself somewhere.

I am not so confident anymore, im constantly defensive in whatever i say, i think too much of the fact about what anyone has to say about me. Not just that, i am scared to express myself, i used to sing and play the guitar and the piano, i havent in months now even though i am in a better place. Not to mention, my skin is breaking out, i weigh over 70 kgs (gained 13 kgs over the last few months and i hate it), my hair got ruined.

Is it still possible for me to build myself up all over again? If so, how? Any sorta advice would be appreciated. I dont like being this overweight inconfident girl who feels like she has lost herself. This never was me, and now its killing me. I wanna feel and be pretty again, i wanna be confident and be able to express myself again.

(Its completely okay to not be size 0 or be skinny or fit in with the beauty standards, but for me, i am not liking this current self and i desperately want to know if its possible for me to start over again and build myself up to be better than ever before. If so, then HOW"	starrynights110	post	19.951694960784227	female	White	0.9646867513656616	na	na	na	1	depression_help

As for your panic attack, sadly, for now, you have to power through them. I know, i went throught the same thing. They wont last forever, they always lessen after a certain time. 


Suicide is not an option, it never was one to begin with. There is other way, and if you hold on, one day it will be all over, i know, i used to be just like you. I tried to kill myself so many time and now im finally happy.

"I literally don’t know what to do , I have no car and don’t want to work around people or have to sell anything , I like being around people but not for work . I don’t trust coworker’s due to being sa at two jobs and I am paranoid around working with men I get hit on all the time and it’s risky because I uber places. I make money online but I need pay stubs . Any ideas 🫠 was thinking about going in on a vending machine with my friend and getting the snacks with my ebt card but I need money to start that. I’m wanting to go to school for sonography and do X-rays I’ve always loved science and I’m sure I can get financial aid but I’ll need a car to get to school and my laptop fixed. I spent my whole life depressed and sad about my past and I’ve mentally changed completely and I am happy and have good people around me now . I just need a stable foundation to build on but it feels impossible when im teaching myself everything. I’ve had 22 jobs and quit or get fired from every job just due to a lack of motivation. My family and everyone has taught me what not to do but not how to grow and build. My dad died and was an alcoholic my biological mom was an addict and alot of her family members have history of sa . My adopted mother was strict on me my entire life and when I turned 18 just stopped and I don’t know how to do anything in the real world. She also likes humiliating me in public . My adopted mom was strict on me my whole life never let me sleep over anyone’s house and took my phone every night and went through it till mid 17. It’s strange because a lot of the times I bring up the things she does she acts clueless or like she doesn’t remember. The church I went to would do weird things like me falling asleep the pastor made me stand in front of the church. My mom would talk about me during the word. She would make me go to church like 4 times a week she has dragged me down the hall by my hood one day because I refused to go to church. Once my mom found out a boy had done stuff with me but really groomed me when I was like 12 and she made me sign a contract and threaten to send me to a Christian school and her and the pastor made me read books about why stuff was bad. I use to get in trouble and yelled at and spanked because I couldn’t stay still and I said I couldn’t and they said it was satan. And then they found out I had adhd they apologized for it. People would hang out with me and my mom would blast Christian music and scream to god and embarrass me for some reason. She made me go to a school far from my house and I’d have to sit in an office for 2-4 extra hours everyday for 3 years and my senior year I had double early release so I spent over $600 on Ubers home. Like one time I asked her to take me to a job interview and she just wouldn’t do it just because she didn’t feel like it but I feel like if I had a daughter I would do anything to help her. And the other pastor for church has a car but my mom for over 10 years has picked her up and took her to church because she’s convinced it’s a service to God. We go places in public and she says out loud you can’t afford this or I don’t have money loud in public. She is a hoarder and collects things and it’s been like this for years and every time I say she’s messy or needs to clean she gets mad at me and won’t admit she’s a hoarder. I’ve cleaned up areas in the house and she gets upset and then a couple days later apologizes. When I lost my virginity she was like everyone is going to think you’re a w slur and I was like you’re calling me a w slur  and she was like no I’m saying everyone is going to think you are one. She always gaslights me and makes me feel like I’m wrong for being upset. She use to say stuff to me like here comes the boobs and like say she felt like she was sitting next to a pregnant person and not to be friends with gays and Muslims and all types of crazy things. She would throw away my clothes and posters without me knowing I would find it in the trash. She wouldn’t let me play basketball because she said I would turn into a lesbian.She has hundreds of books and has been a psychologist for over 25 years . When I turned 18 she stopped caring and I had to beg her to call
Me she would go weeks without talking to me and I had no clue how to be in the real world. I was very socially awkward and started dabbling into substances to be outgoing and feel comfortable and it caused permanent damage to my brain and memory. I eat very healthy now and have a strict diet and have good friends in my life that teach me things but it’s hard building on a broken foundation. I know how to talk to my mom now and when she starts being mean I just ask her to stop and tell her I don’t want to argue with her. It feels like she hates me there has been times where I’ve been stuck places and she didn’t help and she sees me struggling and refuses to offer a helping hand. This one time she lost my birth certificate and social and she was like if it’s not there then that means I lost it ? But she was keeping up with it it’s like she can’t take accountability for stuff ? And she had shut down my bank account that was attached to hers and didn’t tell me for some reason ? I don’t understand how she feels or why she feels the way she does towards me. I feel like I’ll never be enough for her I want her to like me I want to get over my mommy issues. I feel so bad for her because she use to live in california and be free spirited and travel and she’s just stuck in the hoarded house with our dying dog in the same routine. I really just want to get rich so I can fly her around and let her live out the life she feels like she’s losing. My best friend died around 2 years ago and I have had problems with hoarding and alcohol and substances. The substances I’ve used caused permanent damage. I use to have extremely bad acne and never took care of myself. I am trying to teach myself how to be in a relationship after hating who I was for so long time. The guy I’m talking to has a lot going for him and is talented in about everything and is 20 and I’m 21 . He’s so nice to me and it feels like I’m not worthy or it’s all an act. I don’t have enough money to go to school and do the career I want and I just moved back into my moms and I’m trying to get a job . He’s always complimenting me and I’m starting to allow myself to be emotionally available. I honestly feel that having an only fans and making money online through married men has also caused very deep trust issues. I’ve made thousands from it but I do not trust nor want to allow myself to be loved. Any way to allow myself to be loved ?"

"Hi everyone. I’ve been depressed for many months and I’m so tired of living.   
Two months ago, I left the love of my life, we had been together for three years. I didn’t want to put him through my mental state, I didn’t want to ruin his life with it. He was like ""you don't bother me"", but he half understood what I was going through. I was in so much pain. I cheated on him on purpose. I wanted him to dump me, I knew it would work. It did.  
Since my depression got worse because I’m alone with myself, I can’t see the end of the tunnel. I keep thinking about my ex, that I love him. I regret doing what I did, all because of my suffering. I can’t take it anymore.   
I am being followed by a psychologist and a psychiatrist, I started taking anxiolytics last week to calm anxiety attacks. Next week the psychiatrist has to decide if I should take anti-depressants or not. I would really like to take it because since I take anxiolytics, my body does rest, but then I feel even more sadness. Has that ever happened to you?   
I feel like I could never get up. I feel like I would never move on to anything else with my ex. I miss him so much. He’ll never forgive me, he told me.    
My family is away from me, all my friends are on vacation. I feel so alone.   
I can’t find the strength to change my mind, everything is dark. I have a lot of suicidal thoughts. I scarified myself the other day.   
I hope I'll get better. I have to go back to my master’s degree in september and I’m afraid I won’t find the strength to go to school. "	Loose-Charity-467	post	23.41784309466538	female	White	0.9958217144012451	na	na	na	5	depression_help

"What should be my new internal anchor in life?

I need a pity party because noone in my life really hears me. I want someone to not invalidate i feel and know that the mediocrity and sad state my life is turned into. Lets hit the different aspects of my life so i can explain why i feel progress and excitment may be impossible for me. 1) family - when i was an adolescent, i still believed my family had my back and that we all loved each other mutually. THEN i realised my sisters were actually unable/unwilling to listen to my perspective and could relate to me only superficially. My dad never used to be very present, and my mom is the only one who keeps believing in me and supporting me even in my bad decisions, but she is so religious that we cant agree on anything normally and she things bad things happen because we arent living devotedly to gods rules enough. So, i emotionally actually dont feel that much of a connection to my whole family.

2) friends - i have one friend, we have our problems but she is fine. Ive met a lot of people but almost all have rejected me or disrespected me. My prettier colegues are treated SO MUCH BETTER and easily form friend groups. I am in college now but virtually have noone i can comment on my intelectual or emotional interests in. I have become and outcast and a misantrope.

3) studies and jobs - i am studying philosophy and spanish which isnt going very well for me. In class i can say the right thing sometime but mostly i have bad grades and barely push through. Spanish makes me want to throw up from the workload. I hate almost any job i do.

Sports and fitness - i used to have hypothyroidism only with some headaches and pms. I handeled such things with exercise and also being overweight(hence why im not pretty and dont fit in) - my fav exercises were - capoeira, dance and weight training. - NOW i cant do those because reflux. I also lost my voice i used to sing. I dont know how to keep up with fitness anymore. I did join yoga, but it doesnt get rid of my headaches and i cant lose much calories with that as i can with running.

Love life - basically went to clubs git drunk and kissed any guy that showed a bit of interest in me. People dont hit on me normally. Have a crooked nose, overweight, strong jaw and forehead wrinkles.

Interests hobbiesn- used to sing - gone with reflux Love visual art - used to draw every day for years- still not good with proportions nor perpective and lines. Wouldve liked to do comicbook art but its so hard for me and i constantly criticise myself.

Mood and motivation - either the motivation is scattered into many different things i want to improve, either im depressed and just sleep and eat. What exacerbated those problems is that i cant do my sports routines anymore because of helath which were fast and gave me a quick and intense burst of energy which have improved my mood and also made me feel productive by doibg thise dificult things and improving (in weight and capoeira training). My mood is between i dont care to i care about things but i cant do anything right ever anyway ill just get sick with another disease again so... Better to just sleep.

Religion/beliefs - i used to believe everything had some sort of a reason but that i found a way to empower my self through capoeira and challenging myself thought god/universe brought onto me those things because i was wothy of happiness, although i was never popular nor had many friends or love interests. But i thought, if i persevered i would become attractive through those disciplines bouth emotionally and phisically because they really made me feel at peace. I still believe in energies, fate etc but i just think that mine must be sealed as a one of a lloser, and i used to think i was blessed.

Finance - my country is fed, due to not having connections because i am ugly and unlikable, probably after college shouldngo work as a physical minimum wage worker in germany. Yay. Usually would actually like to do something in art but dont sea that because i dont like pretentiousness and being innart world is all about cultivating a fake identity

All in all, i have no goals because i have no hopes because all my hopes have been crushed about health, fitness, visual art, musical art, love and dating(have always crushed on, never even been noticed), friends. What would be productive for me to focus on next? Please give me some constructive criticisms, your sympathies or stories, would greatly appreciate them."

"His mind is made up . We are long distance. He's been depressed for years

Me and his mum called an ambulance 2 times and he cancelled them, he said he doesn't need any help.

He says he doesn't care about anything else and he only wants to die, doesn't want help, doesn't want any support.

Ever been to a concert and the first half you have a good time. The second half you are just there choking back tears having a depressive episode, while hundreds of people are cheering laughing and having the best time possibly of their lives. Well I can say it makes you feel like an alien. I felt like a defective human not being able to enjoy this concert while those around me were. Probably the lowest I have ever felt but I couldn’t show it to make my friends stop enjoying their idol. If I couldn’t enjoy it I wanted them too if that makes any sense. Like I knew if I need to talk or needed support it would be over and we could talk on the ride home. I don’t know why I felt the need to post but just wanted to get this off my chest and I feel better already(on the way home).

"That is a lot of heavy things, and without knowing you better and the situation I would be a fool to offer any kind specific advice to your situation. It seems I can relate as my depression and anxiety together with my other new medical issues has put far down the whole. But I don’t think can say I have been where you are… if I had to imagine it, I would think it feels like being in a pond trapped under the ice and your almost to the point where it seems like struggling isn’t worth it…. If I’m off the mark let me know.

The best support I can think to offer seems generic and universal on the surface, but as you think deeper the depth of this particular idea immense. So here it and just bear with me, I know it may be wrong but it’s what I know and comes from the heart

If you as it seem are suffering so far in so many ways to the point where you want death (which I am not questioning at all) than logically you feel that time, specifically your time is meaningless and has no value, because you are ready to cash out the remaining time willingly. I think that is a fair conclusion. So given my advice is simple but powerful, whether it be writing a book, painting a painting, building a shed, carving wood, making jewelry, tiling a bathroom whatever way gives you the most fulfillment while creating…. Do that. BUT and here is the challenge since ur time has no value anyway. Whatever it u do, find a picture of an example done by one of the very best renowned people in that art….. and go as absolutely slow as you have to to create something you feel as at the same level of quality. If u do this it will change your perspective. 

Given enough time and patience you can do things u never dreamed were possible. And in that u will see just how special and valuable u are. 

Phew geez I know that was just so so much. But I am very passionate about it. I am 32, and I spent 29 years believing that “art” and artistic expression were not for me. Smh….. sososo misguided.

I’ll be real this took me a long time to write but when I saw ur post I couldn’t in good conscience ignore it and at least give you the little bit something I have learned that gives me perspective on my own value as well as the value I now think of others with.

"I’m 21f and I think I’m depressed even though I have a very privileged and ideal life. I’m currently studying abroad, I have an amazing relationship with my parents, a very supportive bf of 2 years and a great job. Despite all of this I have zero motivation, I cannot picture my future idek if I want one. I find staying awake a chore, all I like to do in stay in bed, I sleep for 12 hours, often skipping work and taking advantage of wfh. Weirdly enough I have started to hate weekends because my bf wants to go whereas all I want to do is stay in and “relax” even though that’s all I’ve done the whole week. I have horrible eating habits, usually only eat one meal the whole day, I genuinely never feel hungry. 

I have noticed I also get irritated at the smallest of things and then beat myself up about it. The other day I had a breakdown because I couldn’t find a good outfit to wear. Because if this I end up getting pissed at my bf for no reason, I got upset at him on his own birthday for something i don’t even remember. 

Im always exhausted and have no energy. I have also lost a lot friends and at this point I don’t even hate that. I cannot understand if this depression or laziness? And if it is depression how?

In my experience depression doesnt need a reason. I have a lot of great friends and the best job I've ever had and I feel the lowest I ever have these days. The thing with depression is it can affect anyone no matter how good their life may or may not be. And that's what makes it so scary. I'm sorry to hear that you're going through this.

"Definitely sounds like depression. The seemingly smallest and even kind of most absurd things can cause depression. I really recommend speaking with a doctor and eventually a therapist, they're wizards at understanding the human mind.

I'm closing in on 30 and I've been depressed since before I was 15. When I was 15-16 I was in therapy but I can't recall if it ever really helped, but now that I've tried therapy again at almost 30... Holy crap! I've learned so, so many things about myself, the effect my family and friends have had on me ever since I was little, even how the societal ""norms"" affect me to this day. I've always had a great family and I never thought anything negative could some out of it, but I think my family (especially my mom, whom I was very close with and loved dearly), and society's pressure and expectations have been affecting me the most.

I’m 27yrs old and I have depression and anxiety. I feel I’ve had it most of my life though I wasn’t really aware of it till I was diagnosed at 18. Before that I didn’t really understand mental Illness, I just felt that my sadness and heavy emotions were normal. I started therapy after my diagnosis and have since been with several therapists, been in outpatient hospital programs, group therapy, and mindfulness groups. At 18 I also started taking medication, I tried several different antidepressants over a period of about a year and a half and then landed with Effexor which seemed the best but at the same time really numbed me and the side effects were horrible. I took Effexor till I was about 25 and have been off it for 2 years now. I eat good and healthy, I exercise with a lot of walking and yoga, I have a good sleep schedule, I meditate, I journal, I try to practice gratitude and I read. All this and I still am extremely depressed and suicidal. I don’t really have a support system either, and the very small 2 person support system i do have I feel like a burden since they’ve been there for me through my depression for years yet I’m still not better, I can feel them pulling away from me. I have a hard time connecting with people. I switched careers from social work to floral design and I’m still unhappy with my work, yet don’t know what else to do. I cry and break down several times throughout the day. I feel like my suicidal thoughts have just gotten worse over the years as I’m just not getting any better and am loosing hope that I will. I sometimes feel like I was not meant to live a long life or that I won’t be here in a few years. I just can’t visualize a future and have never really been able to. I feel completely stuck in life. I worry about going to a hospital as I feel I will hate my life even more. I don’t know what to do anymore. I need help but I feel like nothing seems to help. Any suggestions would be great. I have no suicidal plans just impulsive thoughts.	Least_Cicada6785	post	33.05628570950292	female	White	0.9954505562782288	na	na	na	1	depression_help
Do you have any passions or hobbies man? I'm right there with you at the bottom, same age, more or less same situation. I don't know what to do anymore either, and agree that going to the hospital can only do more harm in our situation, but my small passions and hobbies (even though those too often seem pointless these days) are all I have to cling onto at this point. I just hope you have something, anything small that still gives you pleasure, even just for a moment	Least_Cicada6785	reply	na	na	na	0.9954505562782288	weak	strong	strong	na	depression_help
"I've had suicidal thoughts since I was about 8 years old (36M) and right now I'm having a hard time mentally and feeling guilty and hating myself and very very anxious because I've ""been bad"" (trying to stay sober and failing miserably, drank 5 beers yesterday) and I am applying for a job today and got in contact with a few former coworkers to use them as references and I've been really isolated for a long time and having to talk to people and explain myself is terrifying and I'm trying really hard to keep myself calm so I can just get ready in a couple hours and go there and turn this application in and possibly talk to this guy / possibly not and I'm not in any actual danger and Im not a bad person but I feel like the worst human being on earth.

And I've been thinking about suicide a lot today. I don't have the means to do it. I just want the constant worrying and self loathing and fear of ""getting in trouble"" from nebulous non existent authority figures and the guilt and shame over so many dumb mistakes in my life even though I'm totally alone and no one is even aware I exist let alone are they upset about my screw ups or remember them and those 3 co workers / references from my past were actually really nice and I'm just freaked out and ashamed and afraid at the thought of communicating with them at all it's like I see them as authority figures too I'm just so terrified of authority and the future and I mean if every second of being awake is mental torture should I really be letting other people brainwash / gaslight / guilt trip me into staying alive for another 20 or 30 years while my mind and body continue to breakdown from a lifetime of stress and addiction? Alone with constant panic attacks and self.loathing just waiting for death????

I hate to say it cuz the phrase feels childish but that is so not fair. 😢 I just want to not feel afraid anymore even if I have to die to make it happen. Oh hey and guess what icing on the cake is I'm too scared to end my life anyway so I'm stuck dealing with this it's so not fair I'll say it again not fair not fair."	call_me_a_dangus	post	26.32166580543599	female	White	0.9972653388977051	na	na	na	9	depression_help

"Yesterday, my father went to the cyber cafe for filling the form for my college. (I didn't go with him.) When he told my name to the the person who was filling the form, a guy, who was there to for the same work, spoke ""was he studying in ""(the school name)"" before?"" My father said yes. So he told my father ""I know him."" My father asked him his name and what does his father do.... He went back home and told me about him. And I know him too. And that's the problem! He is really so much selfish and mean guy. We studied for 4yrs together in same school. But now, it's been more than 2.5yrs since I left that school. And we never met yet. In primary school, I never had actually any friends. Some were! But I was avoiding them bcz I always took them for granted and they were nerds. And eventually, lost them. I wanted to look cool, so kept myself in the company of backbenchers.But never saw at myself that I'm not like that. And so, they always teased me. I was their first choice to pick up someone to tease and make fun of. I couldn't took stand for myself and just tolerated it. I could have left their company and might have joined my friends who were like me. But I couldn't took stand for myself and, they were more than me (in number) and I was alone. They all were friends from first grade and so they all were united. I couldn't fit with them. They gave me with really worst Nicknames and gradually, one the the Nicknames got spread in the whole school and most of all began to call me with it. I didn't have any type of self-respect and esteem. And I lost the confidence and courage to speak up for myself. I thought, I will tolerate them, wouldn't resist them, so they won't hurt me. But lots of times, they even bullied me physically. It wasn't bcz I was weak physically. It was bcz I was alone between them. And never could resist them. 

Yet, I wanted to look stronger and cooler that like I don't care about anyone. The next yr, classes got divided and I joined the company of the guy(who met my father ""D"") who was also a backbencher. I couldn't understand that this isn't my type. He was literally third class person. His eyes are always on girls. He wanted to have girlfriends at that age(14). He used to speak way more swear words than others. And lot of times, he insulted me—in alone, between crowds, anywhere. I liked bunking lectures with him. Bcz I thought, it cool and brave thing to bunk lectures. I liked wandering. but never understood that his company isn't good for me. And bunking lectures isn't a good thing. I preferred back benches to seat bcz I rarely made class notes or did homework. And he too. And he wanted to seat with me bcz he was told to make clever friends at school by his parents. Bcz they thought he will study in the company of someone studying guy. And I was the most dumb  clever person in the whole school. I was always among top 5 in the school.( That's why he wanted me as his friend. In our school, we have some other books too, to  get the study content and so class notes weren't actually that important.)
So now I am anxious or idk just worrying maybe.

He dared to talk with my father. He said him that he knows me:( and if he yet not forgotten me, then, it's danger for me. I'm feeling freaked out. If he could talk with my father, he can definitely still call me by my those nicknames😭

What if he got admission to the same college?? What will I do then? He will call me by that name and, it will be spread again all over the college. I won't get respected. It will ruin my image. What if he called me by that name in-front of my crush?? What if he called me by that name in front of my family? And what if he will call me by that names when we meet somewhere on the road or anywhere while I will be doing job?

These thoughts hurt me😫 I don't know what to do with it. And that whole different thing that anyone, from that batch(from my primary school, who know my nickname) called me by nicknames?? Among crowd?? 

I want to disappear so I can get rid out of this shit. It's the most disturbing thought to me. I got picked up once again an yr ago and they gave me one other name. They wasn't familiar with my any of old names. but somehow, they picked me and bullied verbally (like teasing a lot everyday by making fun of me. Idk it's called bullying or not...) I literally hated it. Bcz again, I choosen the wrong group of People.. They weren't my type. I'm nerd and verly less talker(only until I know you better) person. And I don't fit with backbenchers. This time, I wasted more than a month, when I got a new nickname. While having suicidal thoughts almost everyday.

Everytime, when this topic comes up front of me, every cell of my brain stops working. And I just think about it all the day. Wasting my life. So, I guess, rather than bothering others, I should cease living the life...

"My English is very bad, if you don't understand me, please forgive me, I use a translator. I have rich parents, I live in a bad city. My parents own a brick factory. I have been to 13 countries but have never traveled to big cities in my country. A year ago, for the first time, I decided to go to a big city in my country. I fell in love with him. Returning to my hometown, I realized that I did not want to live in this city. I realized that I want to leave this city. I am a 3rd year student at the institute (only 4 years), I chose an institute, after which I can’t go to work anywhere, except for the Parents Factory.

If I leave, I will not have an inheritance, I will receive a small salary. And if I stay here, I will spend an extreme life in a dangerous city that I hate, but I will have a lot of money.

"This is a vent post. Recently I've been in a constant state of depression. I'm not ready to receive advice yet. Communication sometimes feels jarring to me. I think that I want to be better, but I;ve no idea what any of that looks like - sometimes I think I want to be alone yet when I'm alone all these heavy thoughts run through my head. My family is toxic so I obviously want to leave them and maybe go nc but I'm too poor and dont have the strength to do things.

Also the thought of running away living by myself seems freeing and good but I also really worry because I can get very self destructive and I don't know how to stop. I've tried therapy but it hasn't been helpful in a long time. It was helpful when I was untethered and exploding but now I've already become stable and know how to solve a great chunk of my problem - run away, yes another mention \*again\*, but obviously that's not feasible and even though my mother has some toxic traits (just slightly more than the avg person, not a psychopath.) I'd really miss her, and I still love her after all she's done. I don't have many people in my life. Even the people I'm closest to are leaving for another country etc. Remaining friends are from the Internet.

I keep trying to change my life in many ways like go out more, exercise, start project, non profit, work, study, etc, but I will work my butt off for a while before my mind/body catches up to my resolve and then im just tired, burnt out, whatever for a long time. I'm always trying to work at every opportunity but im doing everything so slowly. Perhaps it's also ADHD, honestly a lot of my life is attributed to that. Kind of lost or stuck in the middle. I hope to get past this

&#x200B;

I dont know im just ? more than anything. i dont really have the strength to feel too many emotions anymore either. im also realising more things and being more honest, losing my filter. I didn't know I was people pleasing so intuitively. "	rosafloera	post	21.518316213679064	female	White	0.49488863348960876	na	na	na	2	depression_help

"I need a pity party because noone in my life really hears me. I want someone to not invalidate i feel and know that the mediocrity and sad state my life is turned into. Lets hit the different aspects of my life so i can explain why i feel progress and excitment may be impossible for me. 1) family - when i was an adolescent, i still believed my family had my back and that we all loved each other mutually. THEN i realised my sisters were actually unable/unwilling to listen to my perspective and could relate to me only superficially. My dad never used to be very present, and my mom is the only one who keeps believing in me and supporting me even in my bad decisions, but she is so religious that we cant agree on anything normally and she things bad things happen because we arent living devotedly to gods rules enough. So, i emotionally actually dont feel that much of a connection to my whole family.

2) friends - i have one friend, we have our problems but she is fine. Ive met a lot of people but almost all have rejected me or disrespected me. My prettier colegues are treated SO MUCH BETTER and easily form friend groups. I am in college now but virtually have noone i can comment on my intelectual or emotional interests in. I have become and outcast and a misantrope.

3) studies and jobs - i am studying philosophy and spanish which isnt going very well for me. In class i can say the right thing sometime but mostly i have bad grades and barely push through. Spanish makes me want to throw up from the workload. I hate almost any job i do.

Sports and fitness - i used to have hypothyroidism only with some headaches and pms. I handeled such things with exercise and also being overweight(hence why im not pretty and dont fit in) - my fav exercises were - capoeira, dance and weight training. - NOW i cant do those because reflux. I also lost my voice i used to sing. I dont know how to keep up with fitness anymore. I did join yoga, but it doesnt get rid of my headaches and i cant lose much calories with that as i can with running. 

Love life - basically went to clubs git drunk and kissed any guy that showed a bit of interest in me. People dont hit on me normally. Have a crooked nose, overweight, strong jaw and forehead wrinkles.

Interests hobbiesn- used to sing - gone with reflux
Love visual art - used to draw every day for years- still not good with proportions nor perpective and lines. Wouldve liked to do comicbook art but its so hard for me and i constantly criticise myself.

Mood and motivation - either the motivation is scattered into many different things i want to improve, either im depressed and just sleep and eat. What exacerbated those problems is that i cant do my sports routines anymore because of helath which were fast and gave me a quick and intense burst of energy which have improved my mood and also made me feel productive by doibg thise dificult things and improving (in weight and capoeira training). My mood is between i dont care to i care about things but i cant do anything right ever anyway ill just get sick with another disease again so... Better to just sleep. 

Religion/beliefs - i used to believe everything had some sort of a reason but that i found a way to empower my self through capoeira and challenging myself thought god/universe brought onto me those things because i was wothy of happiness, although i was never popular nor had many friends or love interests. But i thought, if i persevered i would become attractive through those disciplines bouth emotionally and phisically because they really made me feel at peace. I still believe in energies, fate etc but i just think that mine must be sealed as a one of a lloser, and i used to think i was blessed. 

Finance - my country is fed, due to not having connections because i am ugly and unlikable, probably after college shouldngo work as a physical minimum wage worker in germany. Yay. Usually would actually like to do something in art but dont sea that because i dont like pretentiousness and being innart world is all about cultivating a fake identity

All in all, i have no goals because i have no hopes because all my hopes have been crushed about health, fitness, visual art, musical art, love and dating(have always crushed on, never even been noticed), friends. What would be productive for me to focus on next? Please give me some constructive criticisms, your sympathies or stories, would greatly appreciate them."

Why is life so bleak. There hasn’t even been one full day where I’ve actually been happy. I don’t even know if therapy’s working anymore…I hate that I’m alone but it’s so hard to make friends when I feel like this. Life is bad and I’m just eternally sinking.

"I can relate to both of OP's and 1st commenter's descriptions. It is hard to pull through that really bleak time. It was scary. I reached out to EVERYONE I thought might be able to offer emotional support because the alternative was.... And this most recent ordeal of meds reset took, I want to say, 4 yrs. And 1 of the meds I didn't realize was making me feel suicidal. I knew that can happen sometimes, but I listened to the fucking PA/NP who said, ""No, I think you're improving."" Double fuck her and if she were still around, I would have had some choice words for her once I started getting out of the pit.

Even after I finally felt somewhat stable, my answer to anyone who asked how I was was, ""I am not a happy person."" I was not willing to continue to exist in that state....

So sorry for how sad and hopeless you feel. Depression is a hard battle. You are not a toxic person. I am sure you are a wonderful person who is just trying to work things through. Do not beat yourself up. Maybe you should consider talking to your therapist about seeing a doctor who can prescribe medication for the depression, I am sure your therapist can give you good guidance. There may also be a support group in your area for those struggling with the same thing, look on the internet or call your local hospital or speak to your therapist. You should not have to handle this alone. We all make mistakes, we all make choices we wish had been different. But there is life ahead. Even though we can't change the past, we can choose the future. You know what is good and not good. You can choose a good path for yourself. Exercise helps, maybe start with a short walk and build yourself up. If you like animals, maybe volunteer at an animal shelter. Animals are a great source of unconditional love. Reach out to those who will support you. Be kind to you! Take steps to feel better. It is hard but small steps. I wish you peace.	someoneinlife1	reply	na	na	na	0.9994592070579529	strong	no	no	na	depression_help
"I took a shower today. No I don’t necessarily think congratulations are in order but it’s something I’m celebrating. Yes, I shower fairly regularly but it’s something that’s been a struggle lately. I used to shower every night because I’m not a morning person and it gave my thick curly hair a chance to dry but lately I just can’t stand it. Getting in the shower after a long day when I’m already tired is nearly impossible. Lately just the thought of having wet hair is almost unbearable, and having wet hair in bed? Well it might as well be the end of the world. I say I’m going to shower after work but these thoughts start building up and then I put it off until morning. When morning comes there’s a couple different scenarios. Sometimes I have plenty of time and I’m able to get up and shower (even if that shower is in the afternoon), other days getting out of bed is a difficult feat. Rolling over is a challenge, finding my glasses on the nightstand is like completing an obstacle course, I dread having to pee because that means getting out of bed and having to face the day. I hide in bed overwhelmed and paralyzed by my thoughts. Before you know it, it’s too late, I don’t have time to shower. The reality is I’ve only been showering about every other day, sometimes it goes an extra day, and while that may be normal by some peoples standards, I’m disgusted with my self. That’s the thing with depression, it holds you back from doing simple daily tasks but then punishes you for failing to do the most basic of things. It tells you that you can’t shower because your’e exhausted or because wet hair or because that means facing the rest of the day but then when you listen to it and do as you’re told you’re criticized relentlessly. You’re told that you’re a worthless lazy piece of shit and that you don’t deserve to soil the ground you walk on. 

But tonight I showered. 

I not only scrubbed my body clean but I washed my hair with the intent of actually doing something with it tomorrow and shaved my legs so I can wear shorts without being disgusted with myself. I took time to take care of myself and reflected on my hygiene habits of late. I reflected on how difficult it’s been and tried to empathize with myself.

So i'm in this relationship with this girl i really love and i know she loves me too. I've been depressed for the past 4 years and it's getting worst. She's there for me and all but i'm afraid i'm asking to much from her. I have regular breakdown and heavy sucidal tought. I can't seem ti find any solution for my situation and so my point is i don't know if i should stop wasting her Time. I'm pretty much a Lost cause and i don't want her to live trought that.

"I‘ve been in therapy for about ten years (not always regularly) because of my depression and suicidal thoughts and had many different therapists.

I’m still struggling with depression and haven‘t been in therapy for a few months now but I‘m unsure if I should consider going to therapy again or not. I know that I need help and that I can‘t keep going like this but I‘m scared and uncertain because of my last two therapists.

I need therapy, I need someone to talk to but I‘m so scared. I‘m still trying to convince myself that it isn‘t all my fault.
I don‘t want to be suicidal again.

Some backstory on my experiences with my last two therapists: 

The first therapist regularly screamed at me (i usually didn‘t even really understand why) and was generally really hostile towards me. He even told me stuff like that he would not care if I committed suicide but that I should at least tell him first if I had plans to commit suicide so we could end the therapy first because he didn‘t want any trouble. 
Unfortunately I tried to make him happy by trying my best (which was never enough) and told myself it was my fault when he was unhappy with me which was basically all the time: most therapy sessions would sooner or later have him screaming at me for one reason or another.
I got out after a few months, but I still haven‘t recovered from him; it took a long time to convince myself that the insults he threw at me weren‘t actually true. I still panicked every time my next therapist called my phone (more on her later) because that‘s what he used to do and those calls usually didn‘t end well. 

The therapist after the one above was less of a nightmare. We had a good relationship from the start and she wasn‘t abusive or hostile towards me. 
After we got closer, she relied more and more on me for her mental well-being. 
It came to a point where most therapy session would be her talking about her problems and needing me to calm her down and reassure her that she‘s not a bad therapist for needing my support.
I drove her to the doctor, provided emotional support via phone whenever she needed me, took her cat to a boarder with her and generally tried to be helpful even though it wasn‘t my responsibility to look after her (but I did because she was a lonely elderly woman and had problems + I really don‘t know how to say ""no"", which she was aware of).
It took me a while to realize that it wasn‘t really a therapist/patient relationship anymore, so I eventually told her that I wouldn‘t continue the therapy to which she responded with a lot of accusations, like for example that I‘m playing the victim and that me canceling the therapy is aggressive towards her. 
Had to block her on WhatsApp and E-Mail because she wouldn‘t stop.


I just can‘t anymore. I know I‘m not an amazing patient but I can‘t be that awful? 
I just want someone to help me because I genuinely don‘t know how to continue. 
I need some courage to start searching for a new therapist again but it‘s so hard."	radically_mediocre	post	24.336868684329325	female	White	0.00711800716817379	na	na	na	2	depression_help

"Consider being your own therapist. 

When an area of your life flares up with emotion, consider what your highest ideal of behavior would look like. Consider how you have deviated from that. In what direction? With what underlying emotions? 

Try to feel the negative emotions deeply, and sink into them deeply. Exaggerate them even. The purpose is to feel them. Once you feel them, you heal them. 

Imagine what a balanced perspective would look like, even if it seems totally impossible to feel balanced on a particular topic. Let the thought of it haunt you, call to you.. Doing this earnestly, will begin to bring the balance. 

See yourself as this many-faceted being. You are made in the image of God, so like God, you can be many things. To choose a random example, you can hate your father, and you can also love him - accept that both these things are within you. See both these things inside yourself. And know they are both OK. 

Comfort yourself. Speak lovingly to yourself. Have 'self-talks'. This will begin to teach you to stabilize yourself, take responsibility for yourself - to find within yourself the support you need. 

This need not rule out getting external help. But a person who helps themselves, is wise. 

Wishing you good things."	radically_mediocre	reply	na	na	na	0.00711800716817379	no	no	strong	na	depression_help

"Hi there. I'm sorry you're suffering. 

Try to build a little safe place for yourself where you can feel your negative feelings - getting really sad, angry, mad, etc. - without letting them overwhelm you, or trigger thoughts that are self-destructive. 

Feelings are just feelings, we don't have to let them determine our thoughts. But that is easier said than done, I know. 

You feel angry, so feel angry! Feel it in your body, and allow it to pass on from you. 

Then balance it - try to think a positive thought about yourself, or about the world. Do a gratitude exercise. 

Simple emotional exercises like this will lead you to a better place, within the emotional world. 

And as you accumulate self-awareness, it will get better and better.

Wishing you good things."	im_empty_and_horny	reply	na	na	na	0.9916281700134277	strong	no	no	na	depression_help
"I work more than ten hours straight, and with the time I spend on public transportation, I spend almost fourteen hours away from home, family, and pets. When I get home, after eating and showering, I only have two hours a day to live before I have to sleep. I feel like I'm not living; I'm just working and taking brief pauses only to avoid burnout. I don't do anything for myself, don’t watch TV, don’t go out (can’t even pay for food), don’t play videogames, don’t see any friends. Don’t even have any friends anymore - just work, sleep, and work again. How can I avoid depression with a routine like this?
When I think of my life, I remember that I'm spending years and years in this dead-end job while friends and family are reaching their goals. And I can't even pay my own bills. I have this terrible job doing meaningless things all day, achieving nothing, and still have to hear how lucky I am to have it and that I could be fired at any moment. Four years ago, I was given the opportunity to work from home, I was happy, at least I could spend time my dog and avoid public transportation, but two years later, I was asked to come back to the office. The feeling I get is that the bosses control us by making us as miserable as possible, and I'm just on the edge of becoming crazy"	Square-Select	post	38.63080286335645	female	White	0.9994762539863586	na	na	na	2	depression_help

"Being In a cycle like that makes it hard to avoid depression. There’s no time for you to enjoy life. So break that cycle. It seems you don’t enjoy what you do. What’s another job you might be able to do? Something that either you’d enjoy, or something that would allow you more time to spend with friend, family, and yourself. Better yet, what’s something you could do that you’d enjoy that would still allow you the time out to spend doing things you enjoy outside of work? Finding the answer to that might take time. Or you might already have an idea of what that looks like for you. Even if it means taking another dead end job in the meantime that wouldn’t require so much of your time. Whatever you decide, it will help you break the cycle you’re in right now. 

Larger picture you might think about creating your own goals. What are the things you want to do with your life? Big or small, doesn’t matter. Spending time figuring out what you want to do. Then getting after that!

"j'ai 37 ans cette année et ma vie est un champs de ruine de constructions inachévées. 

Depuis le plus jeune âge, et jusqu'à mes 16 ans, j'ai grandi dans une famille de classe moyenne, des parents fonctionnaires qui ne roulaient pas sur l'or mais matériellement je n'ai presque jamais manqué de rien. C'est sur le plan psychologique que toute mon enfance et mon début d'adolescence a été compliqué.

Ma mère était postière et elle antillaise. Dans les années 70, elle a du s'éloigner d'une famille dysfonctionnelle pour répondre à une opportunité professionnelle et espérer avoir une vie meilleure qu'aux antilles. Mais en France métropolitaine , elle à du faire face à un racisme hérité des anciens de la guerre d'Algérie. Quand cette forme de racisme s'est manifesté sous la forme d'un harcèlement morale intense venant de la part de son supérieure hiérarchique, ma mère n'a rien dit, par peur de perdre sa situation et son niveau de vie.

Parallèlement à ça, elle s'est marié avec mon père qui, du propre aveu de ma mère, représentait une opportunité de s'intégrer ; elle n'a jamais aimé mon père. Et lui c'est un homme simple, un peu peureux, qui horreur du conflit et qui s'aplatit devant presque toute situation conflictuelle.

Le harcèlement morale que subissait ma mère et ses frustrations de vie prenant de plus en plus de place, ma mère est devenu violente psychologiquement au travers de réactions tellement disproportionnées qu'il est impossible de vous décrire dans quelle rage homérique elle était capable d'entrer. 

Je pense que mon frère et ma soeur ont vu se faire la transformation (car ils respectivement 10 et 9 ans de plus que moi), mais moi je suis né au beau milieu de ce contexte.

Comme le veut traditionnellement le ruissellement de la colère, Le chef de ma mère pourrit ma mère qui se défoule sur sa famille en rentrant du travail et est capable de briser l'intégralité de la vaisselle parce qu'il y a trop de beurre dans les pâtes...

Et quand mon frère et ma soeur ont atteint l'âge de l'adolescence, les conflits étaient bien pire. J'était très jeune et dans cette maison chacun rafermissait sa fierté en essayant de dominer plus petit que soi. Ma mère se défoulait sur tout le monde, mon père accusait le coup et ne disait rien, mais mon frère se défoulait sur ma soeur et moi et ma soeur se défoulait sur moi...

Ca a fait de moi quelqu'un de faible et d'apeuré, et comme tous les gamins faibles et apeurés (en plus d'être métisse dans un patelin de paysans raciste pour la moitié d'entre eux) ils sont la victimes idéal pour le harcèlement, et pour ça j'ai pris des coups, des humiliations à répétition. Très jeune, je ne me suis senti en sécurité nulle part et ma seule défense possible était d'essayer de faire l'intéressant et de faire rire les gens parce que je me sentais seul... Mes parents n'ont jamais porté plainte ou tenté de régler le problèmes aves les parents des autres enfants. J'étais seul face à tout ça

Quand mon frère et ma soeur ont quitté la maison, j'avais à peu près 12 ans. Je me suis retrouvé coincé avec ma mère. Son besoin de se défouler et hurler souvent et pour rien grandissait à mesure qu'elle vieillissait. J'étais terrifié par elle. Le jour ou j'ai eu mes 3 premières heures de colle en 6ème j'ai pleuré de peur pendant un après-midi au point de ne pas vouloir rentrer chez moi.

A côté de ça je grandissait et j'avais besoin de me confronter à un environnement social différent, mais par peur de la délinquance qu'elle voyait à la télé, ma mère à voulu me surchargé d'activité extra scolaire pour les quels j'avais éprouvé un intérêt ponctuelle. Quand vraiment je suis tombé amoureux à 15 ans, j'ai cru que j'tais ""sauvé"", et je ne me rendait pas compte à quel point je compensais mes carences affectives, alors très vite je suis devenu une charge pour ma petite copine, je demandais beaucoup d'attention et j'ai fini par leur bouffé la vie, à toutes, encore aujourd'hui. Quand j'ai fais ma première tentative de suicide par pendaison (je ne savais pas faire une noeud alors ça a lâché et je suis tombé), ça m'a laissé des traces sur la gorge et le coup. C'est une de mes prof qui s'est aperçu de ça et qui a prévenu mes parents ; ils sont répondu que c'était du cinéma

Alors à 16 ans je suis parti. A l'issu d'un énième conflit familiale violent psychologiquement ET physiquement, j'avais décidé de plus encaissé les coups, ma mère m'a balancé du lacrymo dans les yeux tellement j'étais furieux, je suis entré dans une colère apocalyptique. A ce stade, la violence de ma mère s'était déjà bien imprimé en moi, je n'avais presque rien connu d'autre depuis ma naissance. Mais je savais qu'il était temps de partir. Ma petite amie du moment et sa mère (je ne leur dirai jamais assez merci et je ne m'excuserai jamais assez d'avoir eu un comportement aussi déplorable et autodestructeur sous leur toit) m'ont hébergé un temps. Et puis j'ai voulu mon autonomie, donc j'ai cherché une Apprentissage (pour les redditers anglophone, c'est un contrat de travail en alternace qu'on peut signé à 16 ans) et là le système m'est tombé dessus. Pour la justice il fallait que j'aille en foyer et je ne pouvais pas rester chez quelqu'un qui n'était pas mon représentant légal. Donc, en prenant rdv chez une assistante sociale en espérant y trouvé des pistes pour un job, je me suis retrouvé au commissariat, chez le juge des enfants et en foyer en moins de 4 h. J'ai très mal vécu le truc, je voulais pas être séparé de la seule personne pour qui j'avais l'impression de compté... Encore une fois je n'avais pas le droit d'être heureux. Sans compter que c'était le début de ma vie sexuelle, alors je vous laisse imaginer ce que ça peut faire de rajouter la frustration par dessus pas mal de difficulté. Je suis arrivé au foyer à 16h, à 17h j'était déclaré en fugue... ma vie dans la rue à commencé vraiment à partir de ce moment. Je m'étais déjà enfui de chez moi quelques jours, quelques semaines pour fuir mon domicile, mais je n'avais jamais pensé ne pas rentrer, là c'était différent, ça avait un côté définitif...

J'alternait entre le foyer et la rue, tout ce que je voulais c'était un apprentissage en photographie et passé du temps, avec mes amis, libres... Sans parents, sans besoin d'argent, avec de la musique et de l'herbe... Javais 16-17 ans. J'ai pris conscience qu'il fallait que je reprenne ma vie en mains et j'ai fais de gros effort pour murir vite. J'ai gagné la confiance des responsables de mon foyer et j'ai pu être en semi autonomie avec un projet de reprise du lycée que j'avais abandonné 2 ans plus tôt. Mais très vite je me suis de nouveau retrouvé seul et face beaucoup de gens dont le seul but apparent (pour moi) était de prendre le dessus sur moi. Rien n'avais changé malgré mes effort, j'tais toujours pauvre, j'étais toujours faible et surtout j'était toujours le clown de service qui ne sait compenser ses manque affectif que par l'approbation des autres gens. Mon contrat de semi autonomie ne subvenant pas à tous mes besoins financiers, j'ai voulu vendre un peu d'herbes pour pouvoir allez boir un coup et sortir avec mes amis sans avoir à leur demandé de me payer ma soirée. Mais je me suis fait choppé 10 min après avoir reçu mon premier stock. Police, arrêt de mon contrat de semi autonomie, retour chez mes parents. J'était anéanti, mais je m'accrochait au lycée. J'ai fait la rencontre d'une nouvelle copine et comme d'habitude, j'ai surcompensé et suis devenu une charge pour elle. mais on a eu le temps de me trouver une appartement, j'ai donc quitté le lycée que je venait à peine de prendre et suis parti de ma ville...

A partir de là ma vie ressemble à un oiseau pris dans le pétrole qui essaye désespérément de s'envoler, je suis très vite devenu sdf, j'ai vu des gens mourir très jeune à la rue, je n'ai jamais accusé le coup ou vraiment fait mon deuil

Ma vie est une suite de relation unilatérale, j'aime plus les gens qu'ils ne m'aiment. Je n'ai aucune crédibilité quoi que je dise, je ne convainc personne, je n'attire personne. C'est difficile d'expliquer que ce que je suis aujourd'hui, je ne l'ai pas choisi. J'en viens à me détester parce que je suis constamment sous-estimé, et ce même par de parfait inconnus.

Aujourd'hui je suis quelqu'un que personne ne respecte, je n'ai jamais réussi à mener un projet à son terme, je n'ai pas d'enfants alors que j'aurais rêvé d'en avoir et surtout, mon instabilité émotionnelle est catastrophique pour ma vie de tous les jours, je n'arrive pas à garder un emploi, je ne fais plus d'effort de socialisation de peur d'être blessé par les gens que je fréquente, je ne sors plus de chez moi. Je ne crois plus en rien et je n'ose même plus espérer quoi que ce soit de peur d'être encore décu...

Je ne sais pas si ceci est une lettre d'adieu... Ce que je sais c'est que ma peur du lendemain va finir par avoir ma peau, je suis trop lâche pour me suicider je crois, mais j'ai peur qu'un jour cette peur ne suffise plus. Je ne veux plus vivre dans la peur. moi dans la vie je voulais simplement que les gens me traitent comme leur égal."

"I’m really depressed, every day is the same, I wake up, I do things to pass the time, I go to bed. I almost never leave the house, I stopped going to school and hanging out with friends, I don’t have many friends anymore and the ones I have I rarely see, I doubt they even really care about me. I sleep during the day and I am awake during the night, I still live with my parents so by being awake at night I can cry in peace.

It has been like this for almost 2 years now and I don’t know how much longer I can do this, my self-esteem is nonexistent, I feel worthless, I have no idea how to make my life better, I don’t even know if it’s possible.

I have been thinking about killing myself a lot lately, the only thing stopping me is the thought of leaving the friends and family I still have behind, it would break their hearts and I cant do that. I wish they all vanished so I can end my life in peace.

I wish I had someone online I could chat to about this, I struggle a lot with expressing my feelings/emotions so talking to someone close makes me really uncomfortable. Deep down I feel like my reasons are not a good reason to be depressed, compared to other things I read online, but I hate my life and feel suicidal. I hope some of you have good advice on things I can do that me happier, I would really appreciate it :)

"Hey friend.  I'm sorry you're in this dark place.  I encourage you to seek out therapy, in whatever format you can get your hands on.  For my part, my crutch has been more in the anxiety space but the track of material that has really helped me is Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT).  I actually read a few books on it, on my own and the books were quite cheap.  The books even told me that severe symptoms should be treated in concert with a professional, you'll have to judge that for yourself (please look into getting in with a pro, there isn't any downside to it).  But CBT taught me to recognize my negative thinking which in turn freed me from the grip that these self defeating thoughts had over me.  Learning to debunk your negative thinking is a perfect compliment to your therapy for the in between moments.  I do my CBT stuff and I also ""bullet journal"" (youtube that one).  These two practices if you will, seem to be keeping me well grounded.  The bullet journal keeps my thoughts out of my head and helps me navigate/plan my life which has (unexpectedly) been such a life easing practice for me.  The last idea is to try not to put too much pressure on yourself.  My sense is that you're pretty hard on yourself--try to let that go, it's ok.  For my part, I try to be only as mean to myself as I would be to someone else.  And I tend to be pretty harsh and cruel to myself; far harsher than I ever would purposely do to another person.

"The key to becoming happy again is welcoming in negative feelings, and allowing them to be felt, and processed. 

As negative feelings are felt, and loved, they change and move through your being - and they dissipate. Feelings like that don't last forever. Feeling them is healing them."	Ok_Mulberry8778	reply	na	na	na	0.9979575872421265	no	no	no	na	depression_help
"1- set actual long-term goals, that are difficult to attain. You'll have something to work towards in life.

2- be productive and achieve things more and more. It'll help you feel more capable and powerful and in control of yourself. Force yourself with discipline if you have to. 

3- exercise. Weight training, cardio, boxing, etc. Studies show that exertion of muscles creates antidepressant chemicals. Rely on them instead of synthetic pills. 

4- CBT therapy. Some internal issues can't be solved no matter how good you make yourself in life. CBT changes your thought, feeling, behavior pattern. Go to a renowned phsycologist who's patients do end up getting off therapy in a few years/months. Some phsycologists aren't effective enough to change you and you end up taking therapy for 9 10 years just venting to them on a monthly basis. Be careful in who you chose, it's your life and mind at stake.

5- you think just talking to someone about it and having someone to vent to will fix a lot of it. Ofc it does, but it's only temporary. You'll end up feeling the same way again after a while, and rely on people for venting again, and again. Sadly it will put more burden on those people over time, especially if the majority of the energy they're receiving from you is negative. It damages the relationships and friendships over time to the point that one day they might leave. Or fade away. I've been there, a lot of people I know have been there. Just imagine, you're suicidal and you're depending on a close friend or lover for stability through talks and validation. It's a psychological burden on them, knowing that their words and messups and drama can also lead you to losing yourself. 
The perfect balance comes when you give positive energy too. Make their day better, their life easier, have laughs, and discuss once a week on your troubles, not using each other as therapists, but as friends who can actually help you feel understood, and help you out of it. 
First and foremost you have to help yourself. The balance I talked about comes from helping yourself first. No one will be there forever to pick up the pieces of your mind when it breaks down. No one will always be there to give you understanding love or validation that you got from them. People do leave a lot of times. Help yourself, get confident, energetic, take care of your people, show you're dependable, be nice and kind. What comes around goes around. And you will slowly have a social life of people that love you and help you, as you help them. 
Of course some people will still betray you, life is that. But you'll have yourself. You'll know you worked damn hard to be this happy and stable and alive, and no one else has the power to destroy the building I painstakingly built.

6- find religion if you can. A lot of times, the people who are lost, don't know what to do with life, or doubt the value of life, are depressed, including my best friend. Hell anyone can be, thinking that in the end you amounted to just fertilizer. If all we amount to in the end is fertilizer, then by extension your time alive and your deeds and your hard work for money dosent matter, and by deeds not mattering, everything is fair game. Murder, revenge, other crimes, they don't matter then for a human, since we're only a group of cells that learned how to talk, right? I've seen people who were lost, suicidal, depressed, find purpose and happiness again once they found religion. Because it gives you a final destination. I hope God shows you signs and wants you to convert. Because if He wants you to, he will open your heart to it. I'm Muslim btw. 

7- avoid heavy antidepressant pills, they usually make you rely on them as a temporary comfort instead of a permanent one. (E.g. painkillers. Don't fix the problem, just dumb the pain down.). And messup your brain's chemical composition, dopamine serotonin and stuff. Your mind adapts to them, and they stop effecting you, then they change the dosages, increase them or use different meds, till you're completely fked and can't live without em, unless you want to go through a heavy withdrawal period. Allow doctors to prescribe them to you as a last last resort, when nothing is working, you have some serious issue like psychosis, bipolar I, II, or schizo etc

It's simple to get out of it. Just have to force yourself to work on yourself daily, no matter what happens or how sad you are.

I’m 41 and I was diagnosed with MDD at 13. Admittedly I also struggle with anxiety, so maybe that’s the underlying issue; lately when I think about my treatment goals and try to think about the last time I felt good/happy, the only time I can think of was over 15 years ago, and the idea that I’ve been more depressed than not for the last 15 years just feels… frightening. And it makes me feel like a massive failure. 
Right now I am getting ECT, and today the nurse basically said that I might not improve any further (improvement thus far has been at a bare minimum), which kind of sent me reeling. I *feel like* I’m willing to do whatever work is necessary in order to feel better, but I seem to be failing in my attempts.
This frequently leads me to question whether I’m really in touch with how I’m feeling (in general, day-to-day life). Am I just too negative and don’t recognize that my depression is getting a little better, or do I have to face the possibility that ECT hasn’t worked for me? When I think about that possibility I feel so hopeless."	PyrrhicBigfoot	post	33.603736202155154	female	White	0.9985864162445068	na	na	na	5	depression_help

"The biggest thing that people neglect to do, is to love and embrace their negative emotions. 

It's important not to think *from* negative emotions; do not let them inspire your thinking. When you feel really bad, you should not do a lot of thinking. 

Instead just sink down into the emotion - it's not going to kill you, it's not going to be around forever - and just feel it as deeply as you can. Cry the tears that need to come out. Shout into a pillow. Feel the rage within your body. 

And once you have loved and accepted those emotions, and felt them - then balance them, with some gratitude, for example - or whatever represents the other side of the coin. 

Seek to understand that we all contain every emotion within us - every gasp of despair, and every note of triumph, resonant with the choral section of Beethoven's 9th. 

Love yourself, for being so magnificently full of these things, and you will grow into feelings of greater peace and understanding.

vegetarian sounds hard to do but okay. try removing chocolate, nuts, and stick to low oxalate diet. i find that avocado and lots of fruits and dairy are not problematic when it comes to mental health disorders.

try some diet with these foods and eliminate others.

oats, chia seeds, dairy milk ( yes its vegetarian), strawberries, blueberries, low oxalate fruits, banana, avocado, olives, beans.

also try to include more prolonged (preferably dry) fasting into your routine. its good for detoxing the gut and helps mental health issues."	PyrrhicBigfoot	reply	na	na	na	0.9985864162445068	no	no	no	na	depression_help

I took both SSRIs and SNRIs with limited success. There are many alternatives to these two classes of medication for depression. You may want to talk to your prescriber about your symptoms and alternatives. I also found guided meditation to be exceptionally effective for depression, and motivation. There are many guided meditations on YouTube from which to select. Guided meditation was not a quick fix for me. It took weeks of diligent practice every day (often several times a day) to start to feel the benefits. Eventually guided meditation got me off of all medications, and I effectively manage my depression. Guided meditation reorders your pattern of thinking and your emotional response to those thoughts. It may be worth giving it a try.	Deathmedical	reply	na	na	na	0.9993502497673035	no	strong	no	na	depression_help

"Hey there, I'm sorry you're hurting. 

I'm not going to validate your specific story you're telling about the future - I've heard people tell a lot of wonderful tales about things they *knew* were going to happen. But things turned out differently.

But your feelings are very, very valid. The sadness conjured up by the story is valid. So are the layers of sadness, self-hatred, self-dislike, and hopelessness, that underlie it. There is a layer cake of negative emotion here. 

Well, we must learn to love ourselves - and these negative emotions are a part of you. So you must learn to love them, if you want to progress. That means accepting them into your heart, and feeling the emotions. Feeling sad. Feeling miserable. 

Most people think they are suffering - and they are - but they are not feeling deeply. Mostly they are recycling painful thought narratives, and not using all that much emotion. The force of habit builds bonds, not the actual depth of the feeling. 

When you feel deep feelings, they shift and change. They will not destroy you. 

So be sad - be angry, to yourself. It will not end the world. 

And then look at the other side of the coin - and find a reason to be grateful. Even just three seconds of thinking in this vein - which will require discipline for you, as someone who has developed negative thinking habits - even just 3 seconds of a new perspective, will begin to change everything, and shift it into a better direction. 

But you must use discipline, because the path you are on now doesn't lead anywhere.

Not sure where you can meet new ppl but advice on gearing up to socialize more. I went through a similar slump and when I was in a better place and wanted to start being there for people more. At first, after each hang out I’d get really discouraged when someone would misunderstand something I said, when a conversation didn’t go well, etc. But as socializing became more of a habit, I got more comfortable and hang outs felt less clunky.

You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. **But it ain’t about how hard ya hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward**. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done! Now if you know what you’re worth then go out and get what you’re worth.

Many years ago, my wife was in a similar situation. After talking for a while, it became clear that the work that she had been trained to do, and the related jobs left her numb. She wanted to do something completely different. She made a dramatic career change, made less money for a while, but her mood improved. She felt a purpose that had been lacking. Sometimes we don’t get jobs because at some deep subconscious level, we don’t really want them. There are things other than work and career that can create deeper meaning in life. Someone said that life’s meaning is found by being in a purpose driven relationship with deeply held values and beliefs. These can be things outside of work: faith practices, community involvement, political involvement and advocacy, hobbies, or charitable work. I was in an uninspiring job for decades, and stayed with it because of the money. I finally found things I valued outside of work that brought greater meaning to life. I also use guided meditations on YouTube to keep depression in check. Practicing guided meditation everyday can help to put the mind in a more peaceful state, and open up areas of new meaning. Guided meditation got me off of medication for depression, and opened new horizons. You are a talented person. You have unique insights, thoughts, emotions, skills, abilities, and charisms that can do great good in this hurting world. This world needs you at your best. Persist in doing those things that you most value. Use guided meditation everyday to center yourself. You can live your very best life.

"First of all I'm not medically diagnosed with depression. And I don't want any baseless encouragements. I just need someone to listen to me, say something genuine that comes out of them after reading my story. 

Now, let's start with me explaining why I can't sleep at night. I'm 23 as of now, jobless, have a shitty degree in literature which no one cares about, born into a lower middle class family; can't relate to anyone of my surroundings, mostly intellectually but also emotionally too. 

I have always been into self-help even before I was familiar with the concept and culture. And nobody else that I know of cared about it with the depth that I have. And I had been Intellectually curious ever since I was a child. As a child I used to wonder in my alone time about our evolution, space, god, computers and all. And always broke any toys or gadgets I could find to see how it works. (surprisingly I had a friend who also loved breaking toys, and I could only meet him at school. But that also is complicated) I had no knowledge at the time, didn't have access to the knowledge as I didn't know English then.

Raised in a typical Indian family, no concept of learning for knowledge. If something wouldn't come in exam, why reading. Got ignored and neglected at home, abused emotionally by an elder brother (step mom's) and also physically to a degree. Out of fear the situation was like speak only when you're spoken to, always was on fight or flight mode. Never shared anything with them. Was the quiet kid in school, got ignored by everyone. Bullied heavily. Always tried to fit in but nobody accepted me. Except for two friends, both were better at studies than me, also they fit in with other popular kids, because bright at studies. But I felt like they didn't care about me really, they used to leave me out in a lot of shit. I still remember so vividly how I felt when I went to one of my friend's house, his mother greeted me and asked whether I was in the computer science group or not(new elective sub to the school at that time, with a lot of hype), I was so happy to say ""yes"", finally felt like I'm in the toppers group, but the my own friend rejected me with his reaction like I didn't belong there. I was mediocre at everything, only really lived in my world. And I slowly accepted mediocrity.

I used to go to my sister's in vacations. There also I was shamed in front of everyone for not knowing math. Their relative's kid, lived nearby, was a school topper. And their whole family was full of toppers. And I felt like I didn't belong there either. 

There was nobody that I could go to talk to. Almost all the teachers I ever had said I was bright. But I already accepted mediocrity and couldn't see any proof of my bright Intellect. Only saw the worst. 

Then I grew up, and got girl (hot, objectively). Spend 1 year with her(talking 6-7 hours/day), but she couldn't love me. And after I decided to stop, not seeing anything there. She went into a relationship with someone I introduced to her. A popular kid from my school, who became my friend after he saw me with her (and I was always needy – truth be told).

Now after that, I went full monk mode, romance and all that shit wise. As I was always interested in philosophy, science, religion, and basically everything. After reading and studying almost everything, learning about the self, consciousness, evolution, the cosmos, society, physics, listening to several different perspectives on different subjects, .Even passing my religious and spiritual phases (experimentation), never believed in free-will from childhood as it Intellectually didn't make any sense to me. Now after all that, I realized how insignificant life is from the cosmos. When you realize that whole humanity's existence is like a blink of an eye from the universe's perspective. 

Now I suffer, not from the fact that life is meaningless and everything's gonna die out (that hits harder and different, and I get a weird feeling whenever I think about it.). But rather I'm lonely. Nobody understands me. And I can't, even if try, relate to anyone. There's nobody who's interested in what I'm interested in. Even all the smart popular kids are fighting for silly little government job. Waiting their time (years), rote learning shit to clear exams in a sea of competition, where success rate of clearing it is like 0.01% (UPSC. Running after boys and girls in free time. Gossiping around. Nobody cares about the truth. Everyone's fixated in their truths. And I don't see any point in living now if I have to be some robot even to survive. I have so much financial problems, but all I wanna do now with my life is gain new knowledge about truth and reality. Learn new shit. And enjoy the process. I'm learning math now cuz I'm interested in physics but I can't focus there fully because of my silly little financial problems. Sometimes I even wonder if my brain is doing this as an escapism. But then when I try reason, I come into the conclusion that actually most people are doomed so I feel this way. I would have loved to have someone in my life who would care to listen to all this that I'm learning, who would learn something new themselves and share with me. Who would clear their biases if I point out instead defending and I would clear out mine if they point out. Who would care about knowing about the truth and reality as much as I do. But I have none. 


And lastly my frustration with my brain is I can't articulate things when I speak clearly at least when I'm in a conversation. And I have slow processing speed disorder. Self diagnosed due to lack of facilities in village and financial problems. But I'm pretty sure, I have this, I went deep into it. My IQ is, took online mensa Norway and Danmark IQ tests, both came out to be above 120. And I think as processing speed doesn't come under executive functions. And IQ counts processing Speed as well in it, so technically it should be even higher than that. So I feel really frustrated when I know I'm smart, but I can't respond to people's argument instantly. And they don't care to wait for me. So I mostly appear dumb in social situations. Also I'm socially awkward and have terrible anxiety. Even in phone calls.

I know I might sound arrogant here saying all this. But I really couldn't care less about arrogance, humility and all this bs. Like it is what is."	Briefin69	post	16.668380637057652	male	White	0.0059689367190003395	na	na	na	8	depression_help

Impressive things about you:
1. You know the truth that death is real. 
2. You are curious to know about this existence.
3. You are good at describing in detail.
4. You appreciate yourself. Yes, you are smart.
5. You are sharing here how are you feeling 💞, it means you love yourself. You know that you are worthy of being understood and listened. Which technically means that you are ready to listen to people make them feel worthy. 

Rest. You really need this.

Do you meditate? How are you managing your anxiety now?

"Thank you so much.

And no, I don't meditate. I think I'm already self aware to a great degree: even some of my anxiety is caused by it I believe. But for me, not believing in free-will kinda helps in this. I use it as a ""mantra"", you can say I try to remind myself that I have no control over shit (I know it might sound confusing and even insane if you're not familiar with the concept of free-will): meaning whatever happened it was destined to happen (No supernatural shit though, just cause and effect and a tiny bit of seemingly randomness in it.). And with that my mind usually calms down.

Also I don't face many social situations. Due to my lack of interest in shit that others like, and joblessness.

And yeah about spirituality, I actually quite like the psychological and the initial philosophical part of it. Like questioning your feelings, going into the root of it, trying to learn about the self, love, and all... But when it says that the world is an illusion and then goes onto ""atma"", ""parmatma"", I just find it delusional. Which as a subjective reality makes sense but spirituality denies that and says that's the ultimate reality.

So yeah, let me know if you wanna discuss anything specific or want me to elaborate further on this. We can chat somewhere else if you're interested."	Briefin69	follow-up	na	na	na	0.0059689367190003395	weak	strong	no	na	depression_help

"I'm not doubting the fact that it answered your questions. But the thing is while from a subjective pov it makes sense but objectively...meh. I'm not trying to hurt your feelings, just being honest. As my interpretation of it from Osho's talk and also I just somewhat confirmed it with ChatGPT asking what it says about reality and truth. And it just repeated what I said earlier: denies the existence of an external reality (the world is an illusion) . And mainly focuses on non-dualism.

And my views on reality, human life, the truth etc. are currently from materialism: where the central idea is that matter is the fundamental reality.  Again, it's simplified.

You shouldn't trust ChatGPT for that. It's true it focuses on non duality but it doesn't make us believe something is an illusion and something is reality the way you took it. It's much deeper than that. I loved this words by Sandeep Maheshwari on that: The problem wouldn't be there if the material you were using and you were different but there is a problem because you are one. There wouldn't be problem if there was one god higher position, there is problem because you are the god too. Still it's the path on which one should go on the way it's intuition takes it.

"They resent me. They don't say hi They don't say bye. They barely talk to me unless they absolutely have to. Do they think it's my fault? I've even commented to them that they hate me or dislike me or whatever and they say nothing. That means yes to me. After I was born, my mom had a mental breakdown. She had paranoid schizophrenia. I lived with that. My whole life, I knew it wasn't her fault. I always was sad this happened to her. She is a good person. It wasn't her fault.

Now, bc I really believe my kids don't like or respect me, I'm triggered back to when I was bullied bc we were poor and I wore bad clothes, etc. One event in particular, in 5th grade, at recess, it was my whole class making fun of me, being mean to me. We went back inside and I was crying. My teacher asked me what was wrong, I told her nobody likes me and started crying uncontrollably. She told me to wait in the hall and she was screaming at the class.
The fact my kids don't like me brought me back to that incident today. I feel like it's PTSD bc this event happening is making me feel EXACTLY the same way I felt all those years ago.

Me: 18m Her:17f

I’ve been in love with one of my online friends for over three years. She is  10/10, supermodel, Ms. Universe levels of beautiful and one of the funniest and sweetest girls I know, and I’m a 3/10 on a really good day. So needless to say she’s not necessarily in my league. She knew I had a crush on her initially because I had expressed my feelings shortly after I started talking to her, but a couple months later I told her my feelings were gone and that’s what she thinks to this day. But the truth was I was falling deeper in love with her every day. My biggest mistake was lying to her, it opened up the door for me being the person she goes to when she wants to talk about her relationships. So for the past 3 years I have been in agony listening to her talk about how cute the guy she’s likes is, or how she made out with some random dude at a party, or what her boyfriend cute good morning text was. All the while I have to act happy for her while I have mental breakdowns. I’ve tried distancing myself by not texting her first as often and it works for about a week until she decides to text me and all the feelings comes flooding back when I see the notification. It’s driving me crazy and I can’t make my feeling go away. I’m at the brink of suicide. I havnt felt this depressed since I attempted 6 years ago. I just wish I could make my feelings go away"	Imaginary-Map4783	post	25.02722855682237	female	White	0.9916775226593018	na	na	na	5	depression_help

"My best advice is probably going to be painful, so I truly do apologize in advance.

Crushes are really about the person with the crush, not the person that you have a crush on.

Love is wanting the best for someone else, even (and especially) when that ""best"" is not you.

That's real love.

Be there for her, be that friend that she needs, but don't be a doormat.

If she only ever has one person in her life that wants the best for her without wanting something from her in return, BE THAT PERSON.

If you can't do any of that, then consider if what you feel for her is really love, or if it is just deep infatuation."	Imaginary-Map4783	reply	na	na	na	0.9916775226593018	weak	no	no	na	depression_help

You guys are so young. You may grow closer together as you get older. I’ve heard plenty of people ending up with their best friends - but not until they’ve both lead separate lives before. It’s actually happening to me right now too but it’s also happened to me before. Relationships will come and go especially as you age and meet new people get more consumed with other things. This phase of having a crush will go away and you can still maintain a friendship but keep your bigger picture the top priority and maybe let it motivate you to be come that 10/10 guy for her.

"One thing you might consider is getting your testosterone levels checked. Naturally T levels start to drop around your age. So whether your doctor has suggestions with TRT or something. Evaluating how much you exercise and how well you eat is also a simple place to start too. Moving your body will help your natural testosterone and blood flow (aka performance). As well as helping with your depression! You don’t have to go to a gym necessarily either. You could start walking, yoga, biking, there’s tons of ways to get out and move.

Some other general things you could look into, sleep health, water consumption levels, smoking/drinking. Sleep and water being critical to mental health of course. While smoking and drinking can take away from your performance and add to depression. I’m just a stranger on the internet so forgive me if this is stuff you’ve already taken care of. 

I once heard this great exercise from Tony Robbins for couples in which you look into each others eyes for 5 minutes. Putting all your attention into your person. Letting all your worries drift away as you feel their energy. It’s kinda awkward at first, however after a little bit you really start to feel in tune with one another. As well as matching each others breathe during the fun times. Again, sounds odd at first. But once you and your partner can match breathing during that, it’s another great way to connect together.

"M28 .I sometimes feel like doing situps, and pushups when I am having anxiety. I do it too. I know it's not recommended if one is having a panic attack. But I want to replace the bad rumination thought with something constructive. So i find myself exercising at 3 in the morning. I feel like Travis brickle from taxi driver sometimes lol. I feel like talking to friends when I am having a bout of depression but I have recently realised that I don't have them. 
I have tried writing poem but I am not good at it. Therapy seems meaningless and is very expensive. 
I am thinking of adding some stretches, planks to the routine. 
There should be websites for exercise recommendations for mild to moderately depressed people.

Exercise is an excellent way to relieve all sorts of mental distress. There are exercises like leg lifts, planks, isometrics that are low impact. If you Google low impact exercises or search exercise and mental health on YouTube, you’ll find a lot of ideas. Controlled breathing can also be exceptionally useful in subduing anxiety. I’ve also found guided meditation to be a great help in improving overall wellbeing. You can find controlled breathing exercises on YouTube as well as guided meditations for any state of mind. Controlled breathing is a quick fix, guided meditation takes time to realize the full benefits. But if you practice guided meditation every day, within a few weeks you will you will note an enormous improvement in your mode of thinking, and you will find greater peace. I’m sorry that you are experiencing anxiety and mental distress. It’s one of life’s most difficult challenges.

Who said it's not recommended? I think it's a very good and productive thing to turn your anxiety into, and is effective at expelling that anxious energy and distract the mind in a non-harmful way. I don't think it could ever hurt, but is sometimes recommended too much particularly to more severely depressed people. In those cases especially I don't think it will ever solve depression or anxiety long-term, but again it can never hurt, and there's plenty of exercises you can do just in your room, even more if you have some simple weights, or a couple shopping bags filled with heavy stuff. Different versions of pushups, situps, and planks. Also squats, lunges, jumping jacks, don't know if there's a name but you can push yourself out of your chair with your arms and holding your legs horizontal, great for both arms and abs. You can do pull-ups from a sturdy thick doorframe, etc.	quipezunderhaw	reply	na	na	na	0.010889856144785881	no	no	strong	na	depression_help

And I don't mean strength busting cardio or anything which would be a torture and you might get injured. I just mean something which is not laying on the bed. 

I have realised moving some muscles could be better than watching porn for hours for example, just to avoid that feeling. 

Also, it might help me get a new perspective on my room in which I just mostly lay on my bed. But if I keep it organised and put down a mat on which I can do some stretching. Since i work from home."	quipezunderhaw	follow-up	na	na	na	0.010889856144785881	weak	strong	no	na	depression_help

"I want to gear this question towards women who see this but men can answer too if you think you can help. 

I want to explain a bit about myself and my situation and I want to see what i can do to help change it.

20M Right now i’m not in college…no car and no job. (I want to say i’ve been applying to jobs non stop. Hopefully i will land a dealership job that i interviewed for yesterday. With that being said…
I’m “learning” how to drive and waiting on my Dad to give me my car. I say my car because it was promised for me to have it…and i had worked a ton to repair everything after he bought it. He says my mental state needs to change and i need to not be afraid of cars….i have my license too. Also i have to get some insurance. Anyways, i plan to go to school here in memphis for AutoCAD for 16 mo…after than go into design school. 

Considering all this information what would be good advice for me going to meet women. I don’t want to hate them. I’m climbing out of that incel/Andrew tate ideology i’ve believed. I’m willing to take accountability. But how should i go about talking to women. It’s hard to look past the fact that i can be seen as less than worthy to women because i don’t have a car…also on top of that my confidence in it all isn’t great. I don’t want go up to women if i know automatically i will be disqualified. 
If the answer is to leave it alone and work on myself. How can i get rid of this desire temporarily? I know that sounds off but i’m serious. I’d rather not hate women…and if i can’t be friends with them or have any type of interaction with them i don’t want it looming on my mind. I don’t go anywhere. My mom has to take me everywhere. I assume since that’s the case i should just leave them alone i guess. Again it’s hard not to feel hatred when i am being judged like this…but i am here to ask for clarity. I don’t even know what to say if i see them. Honestly i wish this wasn’t something that i have to think about in my life. I wish i was ok with being by myself but i’m not.

I'm so fucking full of rage and despair. I know it was a horrible, horrible accident, BUT HE DEFINITELY KNEW MY BOYFRIEND WAS FUCKING DEAD AND THAT HE KILLED HIM. HE DIDN'T EVEN CALL 911. Fuck this little piece of fucking shit, I hope he fucking dies in prison. And if not, I hope it's a fucking retarded drunk kid who takes him the fuck out after having 6 mixed drinks and deciding to drive WITH PASSENGERS. I'm so fucking horrified. But the worst thing is that I feel so fucking guilty. If I had been there that night, he would've been in my car. Not in the bed of that truck. I hate myself and I hate Joseph Schneider so much. 
I miss Alex so fucking much 💔 it's not getting easier. It's only been 3 days, but I haven't eaten. I keep getting these chest pains every time I cry. Nothing feels real. I constantly feel like I'm dreaming or like I'm drunk. When I drive, I just cry so much that it's damn near a danger to people around me to be driving. I only care because I don't want to be the reason someone else loses their loved ones. 

I just want to be with him again. That's all I fucking want. That kid not only stole Alex's future, but he stole mine, too. Now I'm just stuck. All I want is Alex."	Pretend_Bookkeeper65	post	10.568392139620753	female	White	0.9985143542289734	na	na	na	3	depression_help

So I recently got a gf, right? Then today My friend got pressured into dropping a hint about her relationship while I was at HOME. Today, and dropped a subtle hint it might be me as her bf. I wanted it to be private but fuck it right? My life is ruined. And cherry on top apparently all the other mums in the friend group saw that we are ‘dating’ since her and me were friends but we are gf and bf. Now sadly I’m not the romantical type :/ .

Compared to my friends 13-14 me and her are actually more mature, and serious about a relationship. Now I understand your point and I do agree, she mentioned about being my gf and I was lonely sooo yeah… And I’m turning 14 soon Not that it would be ok, I just want to see since our mums have been so hyped up. And yeaah I wanted it to be private but they had to butt in. And mind you this school is private and it’s fucked up. Teachers mostly don’t care what happens at breaks or even if some one gives you depression, and sadly after my friend technically bullied me into slight depression, not saying fulling bc I don’t think it was much, I didn’t want to talk to friends, family or go out. And after that I stopped being so silly and started embracing myself. Being more serious. Not that I’m adult maturity but I won’t judge someone if they say something unlike everyone, it’s disgusting can’t even talk about things without being judged, so I don’t care about judgement anymore unless someone is going to physically harm me idk what he’s going to do he didn’t say, and I’m getting my info on what the guys are going to do to me, stay tuned.

Of course kids at 13 are usually not mature enough, but I wouldn't be that harsh on them. Dating at 13 is very different from dating even at, say, 17. I had a friend who only kissed her boyfriend after 6 months of dating at 13/14. Experiencing first love and first crushes may be a nice experience to look back on. All relationships I know that happened at that age fell apart before they reached 16, but I know one exception - a girl who is 27, has been with her husband for 13-14 years, got married to him 4 years ago and they've just had their first child :) not sure how they made it work though	BigBaz0nkas	reply	na	na	na	0.9994677901268005	no	strong	no	na	depression_help
Does anyone have any advice on breaking out of a cycle of getting to a better place and then being overwhelmed and falling into depression again?? I (21F) graduated in 2020 and spent my first year of college online when my mental health took a deep decline. I had always struggled with anxiety but had no experience with depression and didn't handle it well. I went home for the summer and started feeling better back with family and friends really hopeful for the next year, only to gradually fall into a depression again. This has repeated over and over and i am beginning to feel hopeless. Most recently i have learned that i will have to take a 5th year to make up for classes that i failed due to depression. I am medicated, seeing a therapist, and know the cycle is an issue but I just cannot seem to break out of it, it has been 3 years now. If anyone has any advice pls pls help	BackEastern5085	post	39.17309721279198	female	White	0.9989487528800964	na	na	na	1	depression_help
You have unconsciously trained you mind to expect, and to accept theses cycles. Guided meditation can be an enormously powerful tool in reorganizing established patterns of the mind. Guided meditation acts on neurotransmitters in the brain (some of the same pathways as medication) and establishes new patterns of experiencing thoughts and emotions. In the end we create, either consciously or unconsciously, our thoughts and emotional responses. Practicing guided meditation every day will slowly start to help you recognize destructive thoughts, to note them, and to move past them emotionally. It can instill a greater sense of peace. There are excellent guided meditations on YouTube for depression. Guided meditation is not a quick fix. It took many years to train your mind to react in the way that it does, and it will take time to undue those negative patterns. But, within a few weeks you will start to experience new ways of perceiving external experiences, and have a new internal way of reacting. Give it a try for a few weeks, and see if it helps you as it has so many others.	BackEastern5085	reply	na	na	na	0.9989487528800964	no	no	no	na	depression_help
"Was hard to cope this morning as were most. It feels like everything is against you. Not just small weights, it feels like impossibly heavy weights. And you and I have to push these weights every day. Some days are easier, some days harder, but they are always incredibly heavy. 

So I just want to say, I'm so proud of you for deciding to push that weight today, even by just existing. You don't hear it enough. Not enough people recognize our pain. But you are so, so strong. Unbelievably strong. Don't believe otherwise. Be proud of how much of a champion you are for lifting that weight today. Even just lifting that weight today was a feat unmatched by most.

"I’m not entirely sure if it’s from me just being depressed in general lately or if it’s something else, but my walls are textured and I’ve cried several times over them. 
Seeing/feeling them makes me so angry and sad.
I hate being here because of the walls. I’ve asked the landlord if I can change them and he said if I could find a way to change the texture then yes. I just don’t know. I feel like there’s something bigger and the walls are just settling me off for some reason. 
I need to talk to someone about this because I’m afraid this isn’t the problem and I’m going through something more intense that i can’t identify yet."	Holiday-Emu5910	post	22.948341372588825	female	White	0.999248206615448	na	na	na	8	depression_help
"Ew. I see why it upsets you.

It does sound like you're having a disproportionate reaction to the walls, which I think often means you're under a lot of emotional stress at the moment.

I'm not a professional, I'm speaking from personal experience, but I think when your brain decides to fixate on weird things like this, it may be because there's a lot going on around you that you feel you can't control. So your brain finds something that you don't like that maybe you can change and then gets almost obsessive about it.

My advice is, let yourself feel what you're feeling, don't try to squash it down. Talk to someone about it if you can. And try to do something about it. Someone suggested trees, like a sort of tree mural I think? I think that sounds awesome! But maybe a lot of work. Tapestries or wall stickers might be easier - look on amazon and go for something bright and uplifting, like a beach scene or a forest scene, or a bold pattern, or maybe something calming like a moonlight scene.

This very much reminds me of an experience I had getting very upset about something that seems small but it felt like a huge deal at the time:
I was in 4th year at university, struggling with my physical and mental health, had very much fallen out of love with my degree, had become quite isolated from my friends, and was in a somewhat unsupportive relationship. I phoned my mum at 3 in the morning to cry about how we were out of dish-soap and I hated the hoover."	Holiday-Emu5910	reply	na	na	na	0.999248206615448	weak	no	no	na	depression_help
Could you paint a forest? I think it would turn out well with the texture. Or you could go with a funky wall tapestry.	Holiday-Emu5910	reply	na	na	na	0.999248206615448	no	no	strong	na	depression_help
Stripping the paint to reveal the natural wood might be a better option than plastering all the gaps even, but no idea. If you don't have a history of this kind of reaction to textures then it's probably worth resolving it in therapy first before investing in a home makeover	Holiday-Emu5910	reply	na	na	na	0.999248206615448	no	no	no	na	depression_help

"Step 1. Get someone in that home to fix the walls...
Step 2. Talk to a therapist about other stresses in your life.
Step 3. Be happy with completing step 1.

Im just gonna go straight to the point. They’re 12, we aren’t close friends, but I am very concerned and afraid, I don’t want them to go. I’m lost. I contacted other more “close” friends of them and told these friends to keep in contact with them and make them feel wanted. They’re on my discord server and they often cause drama and argue with others, because they engage in inappropriate behaviours (talks about sexual stuff as a joke) they’re very confrontational, closed and rude. I really want to help but my words might seem empty to them. What can I do??

You can encourage them to seek professional help. There are many therapeutic approaches to treat depression and suicidal thoughts. You can not make them better on your own. You can make recommendations, you can support them, you can let them know that you care deeply about them, but you can’t cure them. They need the help of someone trained to deal with mental health issues. This person needs to talk to an adult who can help them get into an appropriate setting for treatment. You are a good person who cares, but you don’t have the training required to deal with this. Encourage professional treatment. I’m praying for you both.	kissing_women_irl	reply	na	na	na	0.9778357148170471	no	no	no	na	depression_help

"I'm not scared of dying, i think I'm scared of making other people suffer with me dying

I'm not suicidal or anything just hopeless and anything I do I guess.
I feel like a failure compared to my family. I dropped out of school because of my mental health and I've done a whopping fuck all with the 5 months which I've been out of school. 

I'm fat as hell, so much to the point of that I said 'if I see 50 I'll be happy ' and my stepdad laughed so that was encouraging. I know the disadvantages of being fat and I know how they affect me but I just..I dunno.. I've been overweight since I was little and am just used to it I guess. I don't know, I'm definitely being picky and difficult and probably an entitled cunt but that's me I guess. 

I've done nothing with my life in the years I've been here, I thought I was doing my mum a favour with being a teen and not going out of drinking or smoking or doing drugs but as I went through my teen years all it feels like is just people telling me to go outside and be with people my own age. I have no friends because being a guy wasn't what I thought it was. I know that no one gives a fuck about guys feeling in society. I know that. I know that no one gives a fuck about how I feel 9/10 of the time or how I'm doing or anything but I thought that the people I knew for 3 years would maybe drop a message or something.

"been wanting to drive my WHOLE ENTIRE life

So right now i’m currently just waiting to be able to drive m. I will explain my situation. My Dad and I bought a Camry when i graduated high school. He bought the car but i had to pay for all the repairs with my pizza job. That was 2 years ago. Right now currently i’m just waiting until he lets me actually have it so I can live ya know. Basically he says that i need to be up to standard. Basically i never got that freedom that comes after you get a car or go to college. I didn’t go to college…i wanted to but i don’t feel like explaining why right now. Anyways, i’m trying to do my best every time he lets me practice and just hope one day i finally get the chance to be able to drive. I put a decent amount of money into this car from the pizza job i had. I know i’ve been slacking i guess. I feel like i’m getting better at driving though. It’s just hard to believe i’ll ever get to the point where I will actually be able to drive. Can’t even think about dating or anything of that sort. I had a job at a sports store but quit because they wouldn’t give me enough hours. Anyways I guess it’s a patience thing. I also try to look on the positive side of it. Me not being able to drive is a hinderance to getting a job somewhat. There are a few jobs by here but a lot of them i either don’t want (Fast food) or i’ve applied for and hasn’t hired me.

"Hello everyone, 21m here. I have been depressed and anxious for the past 8+ years of my life ever since I've been 13 and it seems to keep getting worse. Over the past year or so I have tried 8+ different meds from Prozac to Adarall and none of them worked for me.

I have also tried therapy with multiple different counselors and even a psychiatrist as well but even that hasn't really helped. My psychiatrist just recommends TMS but that seems like way too much for me. I'm not sure what else to do anymore. The only thing I can think of anymore is doing self-improvement things like Nofap, getting into really good shape, etc. But even that doesn't really seem like enough.. Please help."

Yes, I did actually. But that one didn't work for me either since I couldn't sleep at all. Also, my depression can be very severe at times. I have considered ECT but that seems like way too much for me since my grandma got electric shock therapy for her depression and it really messed her up..

"Mostly because of how expensive it is and how many things could go wrong. I don't like the idea of my brain being messed with. And no I have not tried MAOI. Therapy didn't help because I feel like I was never really able to talk about any of my issues since they would always just ask me what I've been up to/doing (which was never really anything). And even when I did talk about my issues with my therapist they wouldn't really say anything helpful or much at all.

When I was 13, my parents stopped getting along and would fight all the time. And my mom refused to move out/get divorced for about 3 years. My sister developed very severe bipolar where I had to constantly deal with her manic episodes. And my grandfather died and my uncle killed himself. I was also struggling in middle school academically, with fitting in and socializing. And I was bullied quite a bit when I was 14.

I think things also got A LOT worse for me when I was 16 and one of my close friends moved away, my best friend ghosted me and I ended my friendship with my other close friend because he was really toxic. After that, I became very lonely and isolated and had basically no real/close friends.

I don't really have much of a support system besides maybe my mom sometimes. As for hobbies, I don't really enjoy anything anymore but I do play video games, watch shows, and workout."	AloneFlame	follow-up	na	na	na	0.997837483882904	no	strong	no	na	depression_help

"You need support! ,too, have been depressed since I was about 12.

When you are depressed, it can feel like you are in a deep hole and you can't even get to ground level.

The first step is to reach out to your primary doctor/pediatrician/family practitioner!

They are bound by law to keep your information private.

They will help you find some support like a good counselor for what you are going through.  THEN... they can prescribe an anti-depressant that suits you. 

You really need this because you need help getting out of your hole...and at least getting to ground level.  THEN,and maybe only then, can you benefit from counseling and support and have the emotional energy to get better!

Your doctor or psychiatrist can actually do aa test, just a cheek swab, that can help determine which anti-depressant is good for you.  Ask about Trintellix and getting it free from Helping Hand.  Don't give up!  Things can and will get better!"	AloneFlame	reply	na	na	na	0.997837483882904	weak	strong	no	na	depression_help
"MAOI is a strong medication but a lot of doctors do not prescribe it, I know one guy whom it helps though.
Maybe you chose a therapist of a wrong modality? Did you talk to them about how their therapeutic process goes? There's cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectic behavioral therapy, psychodynamic therapy, Gestalt, integrative, systems therapy and many more. You feeling comfortable and encouraged matters more than the modality itself. 
When a therapist asks how are you doing, they usually want you to start talking about what you want to talk about, it can be what's on your mind lately, what's been bothering you etc. 
It's also important to choose a therapist whose age, gender, personality etc makes you the most comfortable. A lot of the time calmer and quieter therapists don't work well with people with depression because they find it harder to be upbeat. 
Therapists do not generally talk a lot or give advice, often they're supposed to ask you questions etc to make YOU realize things about yourself. In CBT/cognitive behavioral therapy, they might give you tasks and assignments and this works better for some people. You can look at skill-based vs talk therapy. I personally preferred talk therapy but I might still attend skill based therapy to get better at managing life. 

This is sad hearing about your experience:( I know it may be hard, but are there any ways you can connect to other people, potential friends, even through gaming and working out? I know I've ended up meeting a lot of people aged 22+ and basically became a different person since then, I also went to therapy and took medication for 1.5 years. 
I feel like loneliness isn't helping and might be really making your mental health worse. I know my mental health got better when I met my best friend and then worse when she started pulling away. I didn't have a best friend since then but I made a few close friends over years and this helped too."	AloneFlame	reply	na	na	na	0.997837483882904	no	no	strong	na	depression_help

"well, i would like to start with our thinking strategies. most of us are told as sufferers of depression to think ""positive"" and stop being ""negative"". although this is cold and generic advice...still some seed of truth.  our thoughts dictate our actions and our actions create our realities.....

&#x200B;

let's start with our thoughts...call it meditation...call it prayer...call it a mantra...but i always got through with my bouts of depression at its most difficult by saying this to myself....""my feelings are not permanent. my feelings are not always real.""  this is me, my inner voice, my own voice, talking back to me"". 

it works for me. its not cold and generic information to me and its not the barrage of you destructive thoughts and voices and bad experiences replaying in your head making stay in the depressed basement with the lights turned off.... its you.

but you kinda already done that....your words....

its situational depression....

at this situation i am in i am depressed.

in previous times....

it was bad but today not so bad....

situational depression...

my health isn't at its best.

i got hep a

i got other complications...

&#x200B;

still here

still kicking

still living

and every day living does not and will not be its best or worst

its meant to be lived...

thanks for considering my suggestion.

"I'm 25 and struggling. I suffer with diagnosed anxiety and depression, I take medication. 

I'm struggling mostly with motivation, I'm an educated person with a bachelor's honours degree in arts and design, and my designs and illustrations are decent, but nowadays I can't get the motivation to continue to draw or design, even having a iPad to illustrate on wherever doesn't motivate me. I'm struggling since I have been trying this whole year and a few months now to get a job, lately I have been trying to do commissions of my art work and designs but no one seems interested. I applied over 200+ jobs and yet no response back from anyone, provided excellent portfolio and suggested that I can provide more projects on request as well as a outstanding reference from my previous employer but no, nothing.

 I feel like I'm wasting my life away these past months and soon enough I won't be good at what I do and that scares me, it also scares me that my physical health along with my mental health is slowly deteriorating, it sickens me slot because I want to try my hardest in everything I do, yet, it's still never good enough, not just for others but myself too, I'm never satisfied or proud of myself.

My family only consists of my grandpa and cousin and they live quite far and hardly contact me, the last time I saw them, I showed them some of my printed designs I did (trading cards for a university project) they was impressed but didn't provide anything more constructive wise, I always want to improve and do better, sometimes I feel like a machine and expect to much from myself because my head is always arguing with me to do this or that. 

Basically TL;DR I want to be able to be able to motivate myself without having the need to shout at myself or get angry at myself. I want to not ask for help from my wonderful internet friends who has helped me significantly with financial issues and I want to eventually give it back to them, when I can, but it's just so slow process. I know people will say baby steps, but it's been like 6 years since I was motivated and proud of myself completely. When I got my university degree a few years ago I wasn't even proud of myself, I was just like eh okay. It just felt like I already knew it wasn't going to do anything significant."

Anyone else ever just hope for the second coming cuz your tired if it all?that's where I've been. That's the most logical thought of the options for it all to just stop. Im tired. But as a man I don't really get to say or feel that.  I'm tired of yelling the entire time I'm home. I can't leave from my job\career that I would just assume suck start a shotgun than continue. And go home and have a sigh of relief n be like. Oh finally everything I live for.  I just walk into a house of screaming and chaos. Like I expect that from the kids but not my other half. I'm sure she would have plenty to say about me too so I guess it goes both ways. So when I'm not there correcting kids and adults I go to work to be treated like a sub standard human being.  just so done with everything but I can't be done so goes life.  On top of that I don't really have any friends or any kind of confidant in my life as far as emotions go. To add to that I've had some not so good health finds lately. Nothing terrible yet. It could always be much worse but it's the kind I dont feel like it will do anything other than get worse. Anyway. I just had to get this out before I explode on the poor soul that puts the last straw on the metaphorical camel so to speak. Hopefully this helps me hold it all together before I end up self destruction in some form or fashion. I'm just tired. I've bottled this up for years idk what to do with it."

"My girlfriend of over 4 years has been truly struggling with her mental health for around a year now, and its starting to affect her and make her feel suicidal. 

She comes from a very blessed upbringing with nice parents, our relationship seems to be solid and we rarely argue. She has a well paying job in a field she wants to be in. But due to her mental health she has pushed away her friends, her education, and feels unmotivated to do anything and is beginning to have daily panic attacks, trouble sleeping and seems to becoming dependant on weed to numb her out. As someone who has struggled with mental health before, i've tried to show her what has and continues to help me, but she refuses it and says she doesnt like it. Her parents and myself have offered to pay for private therapy and councilling but she refuses it and doesnt give an answer as to why. I've shown her she can do it over text, or zoom but she still flat out refuses.

First, accept that you can’t make her want to get better, or make her accept help. You can keep encouraging her to get help. You can give her contact information for mental health services in your area. You can love and support her. But she has to participate in getting better. Be sure to take care of your own mental health. It is all too easy for a loving, empathetic person like yourself to fall into someone else’s depression. Give yourself plenty of time away from her problems. Do the things that bring you joy. See your own therapist if you feel that she is pulling you into depression, or other mental health difficulties. Being in a relationship with a depressed person is unbelievably challenging. There are many therapeutic approaches to treating depression, and even more in development and testing. keep making her aware that there is help, and that she can live her best life. Be patient. Hopefully she will come to see that with help, life gets much better. I’m praying for you both.	No_Professional_133	reply	na	na	na	0.9958273768424988	weak	no	no	na	depression_help

Today I got notified that I got accepted to the university. This will be my second attempt at studying computer science at this university. Last time I failed at first semester because of my depression (I was not attending classes because of it) and not having money to buy a new PC (my old PC was absolute trash I could barely learn programming on it). When I dropped out from the uni I was doing nothing, but after a couple months I got back to learning programming, but my old PC broke 6 months ago, and currently I'm doing nothing again. My parents told me that next month they will give me money to buy a new PC. I'm worried that I'll fail again. I have no motivation to leave my house or to find work (I'd rather kill myself than work a shitty job). What should I do? If I fail again my life will be ruined.

I don't know if this will help you, but you must have fallen into the all-or-nothing trap. When we set some goals as a priority in the world, and we do not have a plan b, because we are confident in ourselves. I have had many similar situations where I simply fell out of reality because my best decisions turned out to be failures. I couldn't do what I thought. And for better or worse, it opened up new plot twists, new possibilities that I might not have been able to tackle before. Yes, you may not be able to program, but you will have a new computer. With it, you can earn while sitting at home, isn't that cool? And it seems to me that your parents do not load you much with requirements? So this is excellent, it means they are understanding and correct, appreciate it, and take advantage of the opportunities.	Nserx	reply	na	na	na	0.9987205266952515	weak	strong	no	na	depression_help
"Oh boy computer science?

I left that department gladly. All of them were narcissistic jef bezo cultists who are over achievers and extremely toxic.

Computer science died the moment jet bezos became the figure head and was worshiped as the second coming of Jesus. 

I figured out my depression was from that department and the people in it. Extremely toxic people all of them were obviously abused by parents but pretended they were ""perfect"" and ""happy"". All of them acted like geniuses but we're subpar intelligent. 

Make sure the department has good people the large sum of computer science departments are very bad and abusive. They're extremists and it's hard to be around them. They act like the old school writing department power hungry maniacs who think they're all powerful. 

Most computer science departments are run by old school math professors who have been canned from other universities because they were not liked for being too controlling. 

The problem is the department and the figure head jet bezos not anyone else. My depression came from them because of how strict they were and authoritarian like. It was just abuse.

I hope your place is better. I left and switched and got better away from them.  I've met good computer science people even after leaving but you can still land on the extremist easily since there are so many in there."	Nserx	reply	na	na	na	0.9987205266952515	no	strong	no	na	depression_help
Last time all the students and proffessors (except one) were nice. Only the proffessor teaching mathematical logic was a piece of shit, he was nice at the beginning but when he realized that most of us didn't understand what he was teaching he started yelling that this is not school anymore and we should be learning most of the things at home, then he started making a shit ton of exams and when I quit studying over half of the people already left the uni. I want to get a degree because I'd like to leave my country and move to scandinavia and without degree it would be very unlikely to get a job there.

">Last time all the students and proffessors (except one) were nice.

Like I said not all are bad but CS became toxic in many places. I'm happy you didn't have that bad experience.

Yeah old school mathematician probably had low self-esteem caused in his department or his home (probably dad) and projected that garbage onto the students. I've seen that often. I had many like that which forced me to leave that college and not look back. I did like some of the professors but not all. Many were like that demanding too much, causing trouble, blaming the students, when it was just them and their lack of communication and understanding. I found so much better leaving and going to a new place.

> I want to get a degree because I'd like to leave my country and move to scandinavia and without degree it would be very unlikely to get a job there. I'm scared that I wont have enough energy to attend lectures and I'll fail like last time.

Well, you have a goal. It is achievable many professors understand this difficulty and can be lenient. It really depends how they are on the inside. 

The only way to find out is if you try and see how you are and feel afterwards. You can always try online programs those tend to be better for people like you and me who have those difficulties."	Nserx	reply	na	na	na	0.9987205266952515	weak	strong	no	na	depression_help
"Im 16 yrs old and I have depression. Here is my situation put simply:

Toxic mom who trashes our whole house and makes it grimy and disgusting. When we confront her about this she just starts whining that shes not the only one who lives here.

She doesnt feed us. We have no food.

She uses money recklesly. She used all of my sisters money (540e) in a week to buy random useless crap. 

= We cant buy food

She refuses to change her behavior and scrape the food off plates before putting them in the washer. Thus they come out greasy and dirty and me and my sis use paper plates and plastic utencils bc of this

= All our pans and pots are so nasty that I cant cook anything even tho I love to bake and cook

All these combined make our house smell and be disgusting. The floors are sticky and dont get me started on how bad our sink smells 🤢 I dont know whats in there but I always hold my breath in the kitchen.

This is so stressful I want to live a day where I dont have to figure out what to eat, how to pay for it and how to prepare it. I dont constantly want to live in a mess.

I dont want to clean after her and I just cant. All this stress about staying sane and clean have caused me to trash my room. The one place in our house where I want to be happy in.

My room is also often pretty dark because even tho I have two windows in my room (one large one and one small one) the small one is the one facing towards the sun and the big one is blocked by a tree. 
I just want to clean but I just cant and I need serious help. I cant live like this anymore.

Please help, can you give me step by step instructions on cleaning my room. I feel I have forgot how to do it. Where do I start?"	CracksInDams	post	22.692301608412638	female	White	0.9993795156478882	na	na	na	3	depression_help

I’m sorry that you have to live through this difficult situation with your mom. Your mother should be caring for you, not the other way around. It’s Unfair to you. It sounds like your mother is struggling with some serious mental health issues. But you can’t fix her, and it’s not your job to treat her issues. Hopefully, she will want to get better at some point. Cleaning your room is a good way of taking back some control. When taking on a major task like cleaning, it can be overwhelming to contemplate the entire job. You can start small, one corner of the room. Get a garbage bag and something to wipe down surfaces. Select the area to work on each day. After you’ve cleaned that one area, treat yourself in some way even if it’s just acknowledging the achievement. Getting started is the hardest part, so pick the area and just start working. You can do this. Day by day your room will become clean, and easier to keep clean. You’re doing a great job managing a very difficult situation at your young age. Be proud of yourself. Keep moving forward despite the difficulties. You have everything you need within you to live your best life. I’m praying for you.	CracksInDams	reply	na	na	na	0.9993795156478882	strong	no	no	na	depression_help
"I am sorry you are struggling with this.  Have you considered talking to a pastor or counselor?

If you are living in a deprived state without food or proper hygiene/enviromental cleanliness I strongly urge you to contact civil services of some kind.  Police, counselors, whatever you can right away.

As for cleaning, start by throwing stuff away.  First obvious trash.  Then look around at stuff.  Ask your self honestly ""Is this something I am going to use or truly admire?""  If the answer is no then ask ""Does it still have value?""  If the answer is yes, consider selling it or giving it to a thrif store of some kind (Salvation Army, etc).  If the answer is no, throw it right into the trash along with the other crap.  I think from there it will all come back to you and you will roll along fine.

Ive been to therapy in the past, I'm aware of coping methods. But when I relapse it feels like  I forget what works or that it doesn't even work as well anymore. I can't get myself to paint. I just don't have the mental or physical energy. Even going to the mailbox is an effort. I either sleep or am on the couch watching TV. And tv does kinda help and sometimes learn meaningful stuff or gain insight. I know it's not great to watch all the time but it's literally what keeps me alive. I try to do some chores no matter how minimal it is. I try to take baby steps. But it's really hard to go socialize when I don't have the energy. Ive been taking supplements to help with everything. I think my headaches are not as severe as before. But the lack of energy really weighs me down. My dad thinks I should just go out all the time. But I get tired easily. I barely make the effort to drive. I used to enjoy driving. It's just hard to force myself to do things. I dunno if anyone can relate. I feel like I'm losing hope. It would be nice to have someone to talk to and check in.	ilikecomer	post	32.60768447488079	female	White	0.9987325072288513	na	na	na	1	depression_help

"A few more details. I'm single, and autistic enough for ""social awkwardness"" to be a problem when trying to ""make friends,"" but not ""autistic enough"" to receive any sort of disability assistance, because I'm able to hold down a job, pay most of my bills (barely).   


Like, I'm stuck. I've been in this weird funk since I graduated college and was sort of able to ""fit in and socialize"" on THAT level, but as my friends grew older, and emotionally matured, I really didn't because it's not how my brain works. So I've spent the past 15 years being deeply depressed and detached from everyone, aside from maybe the two or three people I keep up with in college, but they live about 600 miles away and I can't bother them with my emotional issues. I just don't know what to do anymore.   


I wake up, go to work, go home, feed my cats, watch some movies, do some cleaning up, and repeat. I've tried dating or making new friends, but my ""special interests"" keep getting in the way (I can't talk about things on a ""small talk"" level.) and I get written off as sounding cold and disinterested.

That's it. throw anything at me and ill try to see what i can do with it, if anything. I'm 15 and i feel like my life is collapsing around me and i'm just letting it happen. I also at the time of typing this just had a ""Talk"" with my parents about basically what i'm here for. (I say talk because it stemmed from her singing a part of ""Rock Lobster"" by the B-52s, (it was in a part of a commercial). in a voice that i guess was annoying to me.) I never actually said anything during the talk. (LITTERALY NOTHING) except for I'm lonely, and basically a couple of oks and yeahs, they basically did all the talking for me. Now, you probably may be thinking that my parents are neglecting or abuseing me, which is not true, they are both loving parents that probably want me to succeed, but at the same time I also feel like the secretly don't love me and feel like i should maybe be doing something actually fulfilling and not be in my bedroom looking at whatever pops up on my screen ( which i do do.). My point is, I, at this moment feel like i should be more. I shouldn't have zero friends. ( I had one but I just completely stopped talking or interacting with him one day). I should have a job and also be talking to random people and know things about them other than just knowing about other people by the things that they post online.) and i feel like i should be having more than what God has given me right now.

"Hello,

I (15) would like to pursue Emergency Custody in Virginia for a friend (15f). I am going to try to talk them into voluntarily going to a mental hospital but I doubt that will work. 

Is it even possible for a minor to do this? What information will I need to continue? And what can I do to increase the chances of success. 

What all can I do to decrease stress for them. 

**Additional Information:**
- We live about 20 miles apart so irl contact is very limited
- Their parents are not supporting of anything. 
- Their parents don’t believe in mental health problems nor therapy, medication, and all other treatments. 
- They had an abusive relationship with their last therapist

Thanks for any assistance.

Just some clarification. I am **not trying to gain custody** of my friend.

You didn't mention why. You shouldn't pursue this unless you have serious cause to believe she is a real danger to herself or others. If that is the case I doubt you will be able to get anywhere trying to have her committed directly, probably only a therapist or relative has that authority, but you could call police and ask them to do a welfare check, and then it will be up to their judgment.

"Im an only child for reference and my parents have helicoptered me and worried about me constantly. And I understand where they come from but they also deal with anxiety and depression and I really don't think they're aware of it. They're Asian and very traditional if that provides any context. I do feel like my friends parents were more understanding of emotions despite their Asian background. But I feel that my parents have been incapable of change. I've been better about voicing my concerns and my feelings. But I really think they don't care how much they've hurt me and dismissed me. My mom gets defensive when I tell her why I've been so depressed. And I can't lie anymore. Both my mom and my dad have contributed to my depression. I've gotten better from relapses before. But I have to say my root of it comes from them. Feeling unlovable, not enough, feeling like I have to do everything they say. Very few times I feel encouraged by them. Generally, they're serious people, don't make jokes , high anxiety , not accepting of any reaction or any emotion I have.  I don't talk to my mom as much as my dad. I don't have the energy to give you more details about my relationship with each of them. But generally I just don't feel close to them. I never really did.  They both have their own traumas to work on. And Ive gone to therapy for a bulk of my life but now I'm just taking a break and doing whatever helps. I just really don't feel comfortable talking to them. They're not positive to be around. I'm constantly nagged or lectured at. Now I live in a separate place so things have been a bit better but I still struggle with isolating myself , low energy and severe depression.  I still get texts from my mom about some horrible news that happened and robberies or stocks. as a family we rarely acknowledge any feelings. I'm supposedly the one with too much. And my dad tells me not to react to everything with emotion. Which I understand. But if my dad is saying something offensive and rude, I'm gonna call it out now and I'm not gonna tolerate it like I did when I was younger. My dad keeps telling me to change my mindset and just to wake up early. (Sleep is messed up as well)
I don't know what to do except ignore my parents because they don't seem to be accepting of how I feel. And that I'm not allowed to be angry at them bc they provided for me financially growing up. They act as if nothing they did affected me. But they're my parents. They say I shouldn't blame them for everything. But where would my depression have come from? I admit I have to do work on my inner self. But I've been to therapy for years. They haven't gone to therapy at all and refuse to recognize their own faults. I can only do so much. I have to unlearn all the poor behavior and unhealthy coping behaviors from them. I feel broken. Im tired of continuing to try and to relapse.  I'm tired of my parents putting me down."	ilikecomer	post	26.196081011748422	female	White	0.9992889165878296	na	na	na	8	depression_help

"Accept your parents for who they are. They won't change. Who they are means you have to treat them a certain way and navigate interactions with them accordingly. Cater your experience with them to avoid their bullshit. Limit interaction with them if that seems like a healthy option for you

You know what you can rely on them for and what you can't. You know what you can say to them and what you shouldn't. You know how unsupported and unsympathetic they are, so don't go to them looking for that

You know they are mean and anxious. You need to protect your mind from their negative traits. You don't have to listen to them. You can listen to them and disregard them. You can listen to them and view them as extremely flawed humans that think they know it all and just laugh at their ignoranceand delusions

I employ that last one a lot. If you pity someone for being thoroughly delusional and out of touch, what they say become jokes"	ilikecomer	reply	na	na	na	0.9992889165878296	no	no	no	na	depression_help
Thanks for sharing this. You're right. I think I just went off on them and said how I felt bc I am so depressed and havent been sleeping well. I know it wasn't good how I reacted. But yeah I should watch what I say and definitely not go to them for emotional support. But I keep doing it hoping they would change a bit. I think I still hang on to the hope we will be close in the future. But I think I have to let that go.

I thought of another issue that if I hold back what I want to say, wouldn't that make me feel worse? Like sweeping things under the rug. How would I deal with that if I can't talk to anyone about it. I dunno if that makes sense, my brain is fried.	ilikecomer	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9992889165878296	no	strong	no	na	depression_help
"It depends on why you hold it back. If you are offended and seething inside wanting to explode but holding it back, that's not healthy on a lot of levels. The feelings themselves and pushing them down are both bad

But I hold things back by noticing the emotion rising, letting myself truly feel it for a short time, understanding why it's happening, and use it to determine my next course of action 

Emotions are tools that are important indicators of something. Say you are really mad about your parents shitting on you in some way. That anger is an indication. An important piece of information. What do you do now? Will things get better if I shit on them just as much as they ahit on me? No it will not make things better

Don't push away emotions, process them and use them wisely. The answer to anger usually isn't retaliation similar to what you're getting. To me it would be limiting interaction with them, setting up strong boundaries in a way thay doesn't allow them argue back. Maybe writing a letter. Dismantling the power that the parents have in my my mind, which is a lot of power, right? Parents are gods when we are children and we can take that with us into adult hood even after they show how juvenile and ignorant they can be"	ilikecomer	reply	na	na	na	0.9992889165878296	no	strong	no	na	depression_help

"I know this is probably weird, and I'm in no way trying to sound preachy or eloquent or anything, nor am I trying to get sympathy from anyone. I just needed to share a piece of my story. I don't need you to read or comment, I just had to get this out of my chest.

So. A month ago, on a nice sunny saturday, around two pm I took an overdose of my medications. I don't know if my goal was to actually end it all, or just trying to get rid of the pain, the emptiness. 

At first I felt nothing. I was the exact same person. Maybe a bit of guilt, because the meds were pretty expensive. Then I started to feel a bit sleepy. I slept the rest of the day. 

My mother knew that I was feeling down, I had told my friend a few days prior and he messaged my mom, so she let me sleep, thinking I had taken an anxiety med, since they always make me sleepy.

 I woke up the next morning, at five am, feeling horrible. I regretted everything, mostly the fact that I had done this to myself, to the people I love, but also a little bit of me was disappointed, mad that I had actually woken up. 

I told my mom and she rushed me to the hospital. I spent a few days being hooked up to heart monitors and other wires. After internal medicine had cleared me ready to go home, I had a psych evaluation. They suggested a stay in the voluntary psych ward, which I accepted. I spent a few weeks there, and the weekends at home. 



Now that I'm here, I still feel really confused about everything that has happened. I regret my actions, I feel guilty about the pain I've caused to my loved ones. I'm somewhat happy that I still exist. I get to see the world, study the things I like, which is great.
But now everything just feels meaningless. Everything I do seems to lack the purpose. I'm missing the why. 

I feel fine most of the time, but I just get these moments, when everything seems to dissappear around me. It's just me and my shapeless, meaningless but still freaking horrifying pile of unidentifiable emotions. 

I had made a post on r/SuicideWatch before the events of that saturday, and edited it after, saying I wanted to find a way out of this hole, to see if there actually was something worth living for. I'm still searching. I know it takes a long time to actually become a stable person but I'm still out here, trying. 

And maybe this time I will succeed. 
Or maybe not. 
I just dont see the purpose in any of this anymore."	adalotta	post	24.17321735061769	male	White	0.9937029480934143	na	na	na	7	depression_help

"Just want to say that I am really extremely proud of you. I know how fucking hard it is to be trying every moment of every day even if it feels like no one understands the feeling or how hard that is, but I see you.

And this is just be my thoughts, my experience, but for me, even in a “meaningless” existence… what is the harm in sticking around? Like you said you get to see the world, study what you like, spend time with your loved ones, see the next season of your favourite show etc and in my opinion that is purpose enough. 

Who cares if you are not successful or have direction in your life, if you find little pockets of gratefulness, or pleasure, or even just slight alleviation in those things above - that is meaning enough. Life in the end is a collection of experiences good and bad, big and small, for me that is meaning enough. Ultimately, in my case, what helped me most was a decision to truly relax, to let myself do what I want, seek the little things that made me happy, and forget about the anxiety and guilt and bigger picture for a second, because I deserve it. I deserve to have a life full of positive experiences, we only get one and it’s been a fucking downer so far. I’m not saying this was an easy decision to make or a magical switch of ~just be happy~ but a hard long process of being kind to me. But it’s the way I found myself to want to keep living.

Figuring out your emotions and feelings and thoughts will take time, and again it’s not an easy task, but I believe you can do it.

"It's not new really, it's just different kind of emptiness. I had been thinking about doing it for a long time, and everything I was doing was either making sure my loved ones would some day be able to get over it or doing that One Last Good Thing™ like donating to a charity. Everything sort of had a purpose, because I had a plan set in mind.
Now everything just seems to float in time, things happen with or without me. I don't feel like I matter any more or any less than the stars in our sky or an ant travelling through my backyard. Everything just feels meaningless.

"I (25M) was sexually abused during my childhood, although it was not like it went on for years but it somehow did impact me very badly and I’m unable to get rid of my fear of interacting with men. I feel a certain anxiety and fear when around them and it’s very high when I’m around or even talking directly to a close relative. I get all kinds voices and images flashed in head, like if I don’t listen to them they will rape me again or many such numerous possible images. I am completely helpless and have shunned my life. I’m unable to move on from these kind of thoughts nor can i stop these. Most of my conversations go unheard because I’m busy trying to block/stop these thoughts or voices. 

Can someone please help me or guide me into how do i manage to get rid of these things.

"A bit of a rant here. 

About the movie Boyhood

I'm the Son of a divorced family of a strangely similar story as the movie. Had seen it while young and in the happy family and seen it today after all many years. Interesting reflections im having. While young me saw a great movie. 24yo me sees a depiction of my childhood and young adult times.

Father was the fun one. Stuck to being alone and enjoying life alone. Being alone made him a bit antisocial tho and we argue a lot. Although we hang out a lot now and I'm much closer to him than my mother.

Mom ended up marrying 2 abusive husband's in a row. Hate then both. One still haunts me that will show up and harm us somehow after the trial ended. Now she's with a cheating one that at least is not violent. Can't stand him tho. Barely talk or see my mother. She insists that if I want to meet her I need to embrace him aswell. 

24yo now. Can't seem to form deep relations with my girlfriends. Scared to shit of commitment and planning ahead. People say I'm really joyfully and kind. But in reality im just Depressed. End up joking about hard stuff and day dream of other people's life in a family home. Sunday breakfasts together. It's shitty"	RockerPaper	post	15.672694014212636	female	White	0.020714091137051582	na	na	na	1	depression_help

I will not go into too much detail but I ruined my healthy relationship by being toxic. We have been together for 11 months. My past relationships were abusive so this relationship felt very different. I couldn’t get used to it. I developed severe OCD throughout and started confessing my innermost thoughts. These became much more intense as my partner tolerated them. I was abusive and toxic towards my partner. I lost him now. The worst part is that all of the blame is on me. I was in the wrong. I know that I will never find someone who will love me as much as he did. I know that I cannot get him back so I just want some advice. I am feeling like life has no purpose now. How can I forgive myself? How will I ever find somebody that loves me as much? How to make myself better? I know that I’m a terrible person, I genuinely want to die.	juneviolet19	post	17.683465517843324	female	White	0.9992371797561646	na	na	na	12	depression_help
